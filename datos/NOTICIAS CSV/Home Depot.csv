0;HD;Home Depot;2020-03-12T13:41:27Z;UPS names ex-Home Depot executive to succeed Abney at the helm;Parcel delivery company splits role of chairman and chief executive officer;UPS has appointed Carol Tomé to succeed David Abney as its chief executive officer, turning to a former Home Depot executive to steer the parcel delivery company through the turbulence of trade wars, technological disruption and the risk of a pandemic-induced recession.The Atlanta-based company is splitting the chairman and CEO roles Mr Abney held since 2016, handing the chairmanship from September to Bill Johnson, the former HJ Heinz CEO who serves as its lead director. Ms Tomé, 63, who joined the UPS board in 2003 and retired as Home Depot’s chief financial officer last year, will become CEO on June 1. She steps in as the company’s shares have fallen to levels the company last saw in 2013, dropping from almost $117 at the start of 2020 to $88 at Wednesday’s close. The coronavirus outbreak has scrambled customers’ supply chains and triggered warnings of recession.Mr Abney, who first took a holiday job loading packages on to UPS trucks in 1974, is credited with overhauling a company facing growing competition from Amazon, a backlash to globalisation and the need to invest in disruptive technology from driverless trucks to drones. In recent years he has focused its growth strategy on serving the ecommerce, healthcare, smaller business and international markets.“David has led a remarkable transformation at UPS and I plan to build on his success,” Ms Tomé said. In a statement, Mr Johnson said Ms Tomé was “the clear choice” to emerge from a search of internal and external candidates. “Carol is one of the most respected and talented leaders in corporate America and has a proven track record of driving growth at a global organisation, maximising shareholder value, developing talent and successfully executing against strategic priorities,” he said. UPS pointed to the 450 per cent increase in Home Depot’s shareholder value over Ms Tomé’s 18 years as CFO and said Mr Abney had returned over $29bn to shareholders in his time as CEO.UPS shares were down 6.2 per cent at $82.54 amid a sharp sell-off in broader markets.

Urban Outfitters sent another negative signal about the sector after the market closed as the fashion clothing company missed quarterly sales forecasts.Executives identified a series of company-specific setbacks, from hitches in an IT rollout at Home Depot to weaker than expected sales of casual womenswear at Kohl’s.Yet the disappointing figures from such a diverse mix of retailers that serve a wide range of consumers added to worries about the health of the wider sector, ahead of the annual Black Friday shopping event.Shares in 13 listed US retailers lost at least 4 per cent in the ensuing sell-off, led by a 19 per cent drop in Kohl’s. Department store rivals Macy’s and Nordstrom saw their shares fall by 11 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively.Michelle Gass, Kohl’s chief executive, cited an “increasingly competitive environment” and unseasonably warm weather in September, as well as “mixed results” from parts of its women’s clothing business.The company, which operates 1,100 stores, underlined the persistent difficulties in the department store sector with like-for-like sales in the most recent quarter that ticked up only 0.4 per cent from a year ago.While this marked an improvement from a 2.9 per cent decline in the previous three months, analysts had forecast a more robust recovery, pencilling in a near 1 per cent rise. The Wisconsin-based company’s net income declined 28 per cent from a year ago to $116m.However, Mrs Gass said that Kohl’s was “positioned for a strong holiday season”, pointing to new brand launches and a national rollout of a scheme under which Amazon customers can return items bought online in Kohl’s stores.Urban Outfitters increased sales 1.4 per cent in the quarter to $987m, shy of analyst forecasts of $1bn, according to Capital IQ. Net income fell from $77.5m a year ago to $55.7m. Its shares tumbled 15 per cent in after-hours trading. to $24.66.The sector-wide sell-off came even though results from TJX, also released on Tuesday, provided evidence that selected retailers were coping well with the competition from Amazon.The discount retail group, which operates TJ Maxx and Marshalls, reported a stronger-than-forecast 4 per cent rise in like-for-like sales and lifted its earnings guidance for the full year.Home Depot, whose shares have been trading near record highs, also performed far better than other retailers in the third quarter. The group generated sales of $27.2bn in the period, a rise of 3.6 per cent from a year ago on a like-for-like basis.However, those results also fell short of forecasts. Craig Menear, chief executive, said an $11bn investment plan designed to better integrate Home Depot’s online and physical presence had yet to generate the expected improvements.“We are seeing benefits from the initiatives — it’s just not at the rate of our original plan,” he told analysts.Mr Menear blamed technology setbacks in particular. IT projects including a new website for business contractors had “proven to be more complex than originally anticipated”.Home Depot said it now expected full-year like-for-like sales to rise 3.5 per cent from last year, weaker than the 4 per cent previously forecast. Although third-quarter net earnings dipped from $2.9bn in the same period a year ago to $2.8bn, the company still expected annual diluted earnings per share to be up 3.1 per cent.Kohl’s said it now expected diluted earnings per share, adjusted for exceptional items, to come in at between $4.75 and $4.95 — a year-on-year decline of between 12 and 15 and per cent. That compares with previous guidance of between $5.15 and $5.45.TJX forecast annual diluted earnings per share to rise between 7 and 8 per cent from a year ago, to range of $2.61 to $2.63. Its shares rose 1.8 per cent to close at $60.64.
2;HD;Home Depot;2019-11-19T18:02:23Z;Home Depot/Kohl’s: the sharper tool;Gap between retail winners and losers will widen as the holiday season begins;US retailers usually blame poor results on bad weather or the dollar. This quarter, they have an unconventional, new scapegoat: business investment.DIY retailer Home Depot cut full-year sales guidance for a second time this year on Tuesday. Department store operator Kohl’s issued a profits warning after reporting a 24 per cent slide in third-quarter earnings.Both companies said investments weighed on results. But what kind? There are smart bets and the kind where you just throw money down the drain. Investors showed what they thought. Kohl’s shares fell 18 per cent. Home Depot suffered a milder 5 per cent pullback a day after hitting fresh highs.Home Depot, which is worth $248bn, has been pouring money into its online business and revamping its supply chains to shorten delivery times. To keep customers away from rivals, it is making more items available for purchase online and offering free two-day delivery. It is installing automated lockers across its 2,290 stores so that shoppers can pick up orders quicker.The efforts have kept growth in transaction volume, average spend per visit and operating profit humming during the latest quarter. The weaker sales guidance is mainly down to the lower cost of timber as Lex previously explained. It is not, so far, a sign of a slowing economy.Kohl’s pushback strategy is more questionable. It has opened smaller shops. In a bid to drive foot traffic, its 1,100 stores double as Amazon return centres. Neither wheeze fixes the underlying problem for department stores: they mostly sell things available online more cheaply. The margin erosion and flat sales growth reported by Kohl’s reflect this.The divide between retail winners and losers will widen as the holiday shopping season begins. The future belongs to those that have hatched online strategies that fend off Amazon while finding the products and services to keep shoppers visiting physical shops. Department stores and apparel retailers that sell virtually the same products will continue to languish in the discount bins.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

3;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Home Depot: nailing it;Stock looks a good fixer-upper for investors, despite a modest slowdown;Home Depot had a difficult start to the year. Bad weather, and with it a sharp slide in timber prices, dropped a monkey wrench into the workings of the US DIY retailer. Second-quarter sales undershot expectations. The group, which has built a towering market capitalisation of $239bn, also lopped a full percentage point off its full-year outlook for two important sales metrics.Investors would be wrong to think the retailer is the architect of this modest defeat. Rather than a let-up in consumer spending or strategic mis-steps, much of the disappointment was due to the lower cost of timber. Prices for the commodity are down 43 per cent from their May 2018 highs. Rain has kept builders indoors, creating a glut. A top-line hit was inevitable, even if Home Depot ended up selling greater volumes of the stuff. Strip away those price effects, and the group still looks in reasonable shape. In part, Home Depot is the victim of previous success. Annual sales have risen by an average of 6.9 per cent over the past three years. The 2.3 per cent rise forecast for this year marks a slowdown, but remains respectable. The same applies to the management’s decision to its keep earnings guidance unchanged.Home Depot’s shares peaked in July and are still up 26 per cent this year. But at 18.9 times forward earnings, they trade below the three-year average of about 23 times. Add in a 2.6 per cent dividend yield and the stock looks like a good fixer-upper for investors.Home Depot’s steady transaction volumes and a year-on-year rise in average ticket price during the quarter underscored the resilience in American consumer spending. Remodelling and maintenance projects are Home Depot’s bread and butter. While US home price gains have slowed, they are still rising enough to motivate homeowners to keep investing in their houses. Home Depot’s strong position in US DIY retailing provides shelter from macro storms.
4;HD;Home Depot;2019-08-20T10:40:51Z;Home Depot cuts sales outlook as it warns on hit from tariffs;Home improvement retailer dims expectations on US-China trade skirmish and lumber prices;US home improvement retailer Home Depot cautioned that the US-China trade war meant its sales growth this year would be slower than previously expected, joining a growing list of American companies whose performance is being dented by tariffs.Home Depot said that its 2019 sales would likely increase by 2.3 per cent from 2018, reflecting “potential impacts to the US consumer arising from recently announced tariffs.” It previously forecast growth of 3.3 per cent. Same-store sales, a crucial metric for retailers, are now expected to grow 4 per cent, down one percentage point from the group’s forecast in May.The world’s biggest home improvement retailer, which has almost 3,000 stores in 50 states selling everything from kitchens to candles, said its full-year earnings per share would not fall below expectations, however. Chairman, chief executive and president Craig Menear added that the “stable housing market” would continue to support the business.Home Depot, which is also suffering from deflation in lumber prices that forces it to lower the cost of its flooring, fences and decks, has warned on the impact of tariffs just days after tractor maker Deere & Co raised similar concerns.An escalating conflict between Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping has prompted the US to impose tariffs — taxes that raise the cost of exporting to the US — on Made in China products from flatscreen TVs to footwear. The cost of these import taxes to the average US household will be around $1,000 a year, investment bank JPMorgan has estimated.Meanwhile, hundreds of US companies and trade associations said in a joint communique in June that the proposed duties would cause the loss of 2m jobs and reduce US economic output by 1 per cent.Ahead of these results, analysts at UBS had also predicted Home Depot would cut guidance because US consumer sentiment has weakened.Financial markets have displayed widespread fears that the US economy will enter a recession. Last week’s inversion of the yield curve reflects concerns the economy may contract next year or in 2021.But so far during this financial results season, corporate America has shown few signs of being held back by recession fears. A majority of companies in the S&P 500 index of leading shares have beaten analysts’ earnings forecasts so far.In the second quarter of the year, Home Depot’s sales at stores open for more than a year rose by 3.1 per cent. Its net income rose by 0.8 per cent to $3.48bn,
5;HD;Home Depot;2019-05-22T15:45:40Z;DIY retailer Lowe’s issues profit warning on rising costs;Shares sink 11 per cent as doubts emerge over group’s ability to take on Home Depot;US home improvement chain Lowe’s slashed its profit guidance for 2019 as it said rising costs had weighed on first-quarter earnings, raising doubts about the retailer’s plan to claw back market share from its arch-rival Home Depot.Shares sank 11 per cent in morning trading in New York after Lowe’s warned full-year profits could be as much as 9 per cent lower than a forecast it issued just three months ago.Marvin Ellison, chief executive, said the pressures showed “we still have work to do”. He took the helm in July last year amid activist pressure to improve the group’s performance. “This is a multiyear transformation, and we’re in phase one of a three-phase process.”Lowe’s, based in North Carolina, operates about 2,000 home improvement and hardware stores across the US and Canada. It has 190,000 full-time and 110,000 part-time employees and has been listed since 1961.More recently the company has struggled to retain market share against arch-rival Home Depot, which has had more success luring DIY enthusiasts and professional builders.In contrast to Lowe’s, Home Depot this week said it was still on track to deliver its annual profits target. Lowe’s is closing underperforming stores as part of its efforts to better compete.The earnings were the latest in a mixed batch of figures from US consumer-facing companies. They came a day after three of the largest department store chains, Nordstrom, Kohl’s and JC Penney, reported sliding sales that sent their share prices tumbling.Other results have been stronger. Shares in Target jumped 9 per cent on Wednesday after the big box food-to-footwear retailer disclosed a 4.8 per cent rise in like-for-like sales.Lowe’s top line held up in the three months to the start of May even though wet weather in February damped demand.Same-store sales rose 3.5 per cent from a year ago, which Mr Ellison said were a clear indication “the consumer is healthy and our focus on retail fundamentals is gaining traction”.Gross margins, however, contracted from 33.1 per cent a year ago to 31.5 per cent. Mr Ellison said a “convergence of factors” led to the margin pressure, including “unprecedented levels of change” in merchandising. “There was much more disruption [in the first quarter] than we anticipated.”For the 2019 fiscal year, Lowe’s on Wednesday said it expected earnings per share of $5.54 to $5.74. That compared with the $6.00 to $6.10 range it had provided in February.
6;HD;Home Depot;2019-05-21T10:46:18Z;Earnings rise at Home Depot but sales miss estimates;DIY group reiterated its pared-down sales guidance for the fiscal year;Home Depot reported a rise in earnings that beat analysts’ expectations in the first quarter, but a closely watched sales metric missed estimates as the US housing market stuttered.The Atlanta-based company said net earnings rose to $2.5bn in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, beating expectations and up from $2.4bn the previous year. Earnings per diluted share rose to $2.27, 9 cents above estimates compiled by Factset.“We were pleased with the underlying performance of the core business despite unfavourable weather in February and significant deflation in lumber prices compared to a year ago,” said Craig Menear, chief executive.The company reported revenue of $26.4bn, a 5.7 per cent increase from the first quarter of fiscal 2018 which had also included one extra selling week.But the world’s biggest home improvement group on Wednesday said like-for-like sales grew 2.5 per cent, sharply missing expectations for a 4.2 per cent rise.Home Depot, which is seen as a bellwether for the US housing market, reiterated its pared-down sales guidance for the fiscal year, after warning in February that sales growth was set to slow in a move that was seen as a sign the slowing US housing market was denting demand for the do-it-yourself market.Data last month showed sales of previously owned homes fell by the most in more than three years in March, signalling the housing market is still trying to regain its footing after the prior year’s slowdown.The company has seen a roughly $1bn impact from the tariff battle between the US and China, executive vice-president Ted Decker said, and expects a further $1bn hit should the US escalate with further tariffs, although it is yet to fully calculate the cost of the impact.
7;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Macy’s and Home Depot flag slowing sales growth in 2019;US retailers report mixed earnings as investors analyse American consumer health;Two of the biggest names in US retail, Macy’s and Home Depot, cautioned on Tuesday that sales growth would slow this year, in the latest mixed earnings report from the sector.Macy’s, the department-store chain, followed up a profit warning it issued last month by forecasting that like-for-like sales would be flat or rise no more than 1 per cent in 2019, compared with a rise of 1.7 per cent at its own stores last year.Home Depot, meanwhile, said like-for-like sales growth would moderate from 5.2 per cent to 5 per cent this year, a sign that a slowing US housing market is denting do-it-yourself demand.While that is stronger than much of the retail sector, the home improvement chain’s guidance for tempered growth — along with weaker than expected quarterly sales — was notable as it has a record of delivering forecast-beating results.Economic data also released on Tuesday showed the number of new homes built in December dropped 11 per cent from the previous month to the lowest level in more than two years. Shares in Home Depot fell as much as 3.8 per cent.“As we look to 2019, most housing metrics are trending positive, albeit heading towards stability,” said Carol Tomé, chief financial officer.Investors are scrutinising a batch of earnings reports from the retail sector for clues about the financial health of the American consumer and how companies are coping with the rise of online shopping.Walmart last week reported its strongest fourth-quarter sales in at least a decade, yet other results so far have been patchy, dousing hopes that the holiday season would be the strongest in years. Home Depot’s smaller peer Lowe’s and Macy’s rival JCPenney are among other retailers due to report earnings later this week.Macy’s shares sold off heavily after it said last month that sales had weakened in mid-December. Shares rallied as much as 5.1 per cent on Tuesday as it set out plans to improve profitability with cost-cutting.The company said it aimed to generate annual expense savings of $100m this year. About 100 positions are being cut as the company reduces “the complexity of the upper management structure”.Paula Price, chief financial officer, said: “I see a clear path to sustainable sales growth that builds off of the year of growth that we just achieved. We also have a significant opportunity to deliver improved productivity and profitability.”Net sales in the 13 weeks to February came in at $8.46bn compared with $8.67bn in the 14-week period a year ago. Net income dropped from $1.34bn to $740m, in part because tax changes boosted the results a year ago.At Home Depot, net sales rose 11 per cent in the three months to the start of February to $26.5bn, shy of the $26.6bn forecast by analysts. Net earnings came in at $2.34bn compared with $1.78bn in the prior year period.
8;HD;Home Depot;2019-02-26T14:23:04Z;Home Depot forecasts slower sales growth for 2019;;Home Depot cautioned like-for-like sales growth would slow this year in a sign that a slowdown in the US housing market is denting DIY demand.Shares fell 3.2 per cent in pre-market trading after the US home improvement chain’s fourth quarter sales and profits fell short of Wall Street forecasts.Figures last week showed US existing home sales dropped 1.2 per cent in January — the slowest pace of growth in more than three years, according to the National Association of Realtors data.Net sales at Home Depot rose 11 per cent in the three months to the start of February to $26.5bn, shy of the $26.6bn forecast by analysts. The disappointment was notable as the company has a record of delivering better than forecast results. Net earnings came in at $2.34bn compared with $1.78bn in the prior year period.The company said it expected comparable sales to rise 5 per cent in 2019, a slight slowdown from the 5.2 per cent recorded last year.
9;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;HD;Home Depot;2018-11-13T13:31:47Z;Home Depot raises 2018 outlook again after strong quarter;;Home Depot lifted its sales and profits outlook for the second time this year, as the home improvement retailer continues to cash in from a robust US housing market that has seen Americans invest in their homes.The world’s biggest DIY chain said earnings for the current fiscal year are now expected to come in at $9.75 per diluted share, up by from the $9.42 it had forecast in August.Like-for-like sales, a key industry metric, is forecast to climb 5.5 per cent for the year, up from a previous target of 5.2 per cent, and will help lift overall sales growth 20 basis points higher to 7.2 per cent.“We believe this is a testament to the overall strength of demand in the home improvement market,” said Craig Menear, chairman and chief executive.With house prices continuing their steady rise and supply tight, Americans have been upping their spending on home renovations. And unlike rival Lowe’s, Home Depot has had more success locking in the business of both DIY enthusiasts and professional builders.This was underscored by Home Depot’s latest quarterly earnings. For the three months to October 28, sales rose 5.1 per cent to $26.3bn, topping expectations for $26.2bn. The company benefited from customers spending more money each visit, with the average transaction up 3.6 per cent to $65.11.Net income meanwhile jumped by nearly a third to $2.8bn, or $2.51 per diluted share thanks to a lower corporate tax rate.Shares in Home Depot, down 16 per cent since mid-September amid concerns that higher borrowing costs could weigh on the housing market, rose nearly 2 per cent in pre-market trading.
11;HD;Home Depot;2018-11-05T13:21:51Z;Lowe’s slims down further as it looks to compete with Home Depot;;Lowe’s will close down 51 underperforming stores in the US and Canada over the next three months as part of an ongoing efforts by new chief executive Marvin Ellison to slim down and better compete with rival Home Depot.The US home improvement retailer has already announced plans in August to shutter all its Orchard Supply Hardware stores in order to focus on its core business. At the time, it sharply cut its profits outlook for the fiscal year ending in February 2019 to $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share, down from $5.40 to $5.50, as a result of the restructuring.Lowe’s said Monday’s announcement — which would affect about 1 per cent of its total store count — would result in an additional hit of $0.28 to $0.34 per diluted share to full-year earnings.The company will give additional information on the impact of the store closings when it reports quarterly results on November 20.Mr Ellison was tapped to take the helm of Lowe’s in May amid activist pressure to improve its performance. Shares in Lowe’s, down about 17 per cent since late September, were unchanged in pre-market trading.
12;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Home improvement shares rise again as Florence approaches US;;DIY and home improvement retailers continued to advance on Tuesday amid expectations that rebuilding efforts following Hurricane Florence could boost demand for their products.Home Depot shares advanced 1.5 per cent to $213.89, while Lowe’s shares were up 1.6 per cent to $114.17. That followed gains of more than 2 per cent for both companies on Monday.Consumers often stock up on materials like plywood to cover up their windows and other materials to protect their homes ahead of a hurricane. Expectations around rebuilding efforts following such a weather event also helped boost these companies.Shares of Generac Holdings, which makes generators, rose 1 per cent to $59.43.Meanwhile, insurance providers attempted to recoup some of their recent losses stemming from fears of the “potentially catastrophic” impact Florence could have. Shares in Progressive, Allstate and Everest Re all edged up 0.3 per cent, while Torchmark shares rose 0.5 per cent. AIG however continued to drop, slipping 0.6 per cent.The National Hurricane Center has said the Category 4 hurricane is “getting better organised and increasing in size” and noted that a “life-threatening storm surge [is] possible along the coasts of North and South Carolina”.Data showed its maximum sustained wind speed at 130 miles per hour (215km per hour) down from 140 miles per hour on Monday. However, the NHC noted that “Florence is expected to begin re-strengthening later today and continue a slow strengthening trend for the next day or so”.The NHC added: “While some weakening is expected on Thursday, Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through landfall.”Florence is expected to approach the coast of North Carolina or South Carolina on Thursday and Friday.
13;HD;Home Depot;2018-09-10T23:51:18Z;Insurance shares sink as Hurricane Florence looms;Category 4 storm menaces US east coast;Insurance shares took a hit on Monday as officials warned on the “potentially catastrophic” impact of Hurricane Florence, a major storm that could hit the east coast of the US as early as Thursday.But the likelihood of the rebuilding effort that could follow such a storm propped up home improvement companies such as Home Depot and Lowe’s.The National Hurricane Center upgraded Florence to a category 4 storm on Monday and described it as an “large and extremely dangerous hurricane”. Data showed its maximum sustained wind speed at 140 miles per hour (220km per hour) and the NHC said further strengthening was anticipated.A “life-threatening storm surge” is likely along portions of the coastlines of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, the NHC said, with a storm surge watch likely to be issued for some of these areas by Tuesday.“On the forecast track, the center of Florence will move over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and the Bahamas Tuesday and Wednesday, and approach the coast of South Carolina or North Carolina on Thursday,” the NHC said in an update on Monday afternoon.The S&P 500 insurance subsector was down 0.7 per cent during lunchtime trading in New York, weaker than both the broader financial sector and the benchmark S&P 500, which were both up about 0.3 per cent.American International Group and Travellers finished down by 1.8 per cent and 1.9 per cent, respectively while Progressive was off 1.6 per cent and Chubb dropped 0.8 per cent. The worst performers, though were Torchmark and Everest Re Group — which saw declines blow out to 4.5 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively, by the closing bell.Benefiting from a predicted need for homebuilding materials in any repair efforts, Lowe’s was up 2.6 per cent and Home Depot gained 2.2 per cent.
14;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Home Depot builds up sales outlook after second quarter outperforms;DIY retailer cites strong US economy, but warns transportation costs are rising;Strength in the US economy and the home-improvement sector helped Home Depot report upbeat quarterly sales and push full-year forecasts higher, though the company cautioned that higher transportation costs could hurt its margins.The Atlanta-based company, seen as a bellwether for the US housing market and consumer confidence, on Tuesday said it expects revenues to rise 7 per cent in the 2018 fiscal year, which includes an extra selling week on the previous year. Same-store sales, which only include outlets open at least a year, are now forecast to rise 5.3 per cent.“We continue to expect strong economic growth with the backdrop of a healthy home-improvement environment,” said chief financial officer Carol Tomé on the earnings call. “Homeowners continue to enjoy home price appreciation and rising wages and low unemployment have driven consumer confidence to record high levels.”Home Depot, which is known for its vast, warehouse-like stores, previously forecast overall sales growth of 6.7 per cent, with comparable sales up 5 per cent. The group on Tuesday also boosted its full-year earnings view to $9.42 a share from $9.31.Despite the upbeat outlook, its shares came under some pressure as the company cautioned that higher-than-expected transportation costs could hurt profitability. “We like the rest of the nation are facing higher transportation and fuel costs,” said Ms Tomé. “We’re doing our best to manage through it but there’s a real issue in the transportation markets in our country.”Home Depot now expects its gross margin to rise by 41 basis points this year, down from 44 basis points previously.The company has been successful in tapping into a vigorous US economy and generally strong housing market — with consumers going to its stores to buy everything from paint brushes to barbecue grills.Its shares had trailed the broader market this year before Tuesday’s results, with a 2.4 per cent rise against 5.6 per cent for the S&P 500. But over the past 12 months, shares are up 25.6 per cent, about 10 percentage points better than the benchmark.Sales in the fiscal second quarter climbed 8.4 per cent from the comparable period in 2017 to $30.46bn. Comparable sales jumped 8 per cent. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast revenues of $30bn on same-store sales growth of 6.7 per cent.Net earnings climbed to $3.5bn, or $3.05 a diluted share, compared with $2.7bn, or $2.25 a share in the year-earlier period.Home Depot shares were off 1 per cent by lunchtime in New York.
15;HD;Home Depot;2018-05-15T17:27:37Z;Home Depot: cold bath;Weather is not the biggest challenge;"Home Depot, which knows a thing or two about plumbing, calls it the bathtub effect: sales that should have come in the first quarter will just flow into the second. The retailer reported a subdued first three months on Tuesday, blaming poor weather. Usually strong US like-for-like sales growth came in at 3.9 per cent when the forecast was for 4.8. Spring sunshine is supposed to bring out those shoppers.Weather excuses are usually the first refuge of the feckless. On that front, however, Home Depot deserves the benefit of the doubt. Old Man Winter did not depart quickly in much of the US. More worryingly, though, the factors that have driven Home Depot shares up 138 per cent in the past five years are also experiencing a change.Research from Credit Suisse shows the performance of hard goods retail stocks are most strongly correlated with the path of interest rates. In Home Depot’s case, higher rates constrain home purchases and investment in home improvement.Home Depot’s defence is that prices are still strong in hot spots such as Seattle and Denver and that mortgage rates remain below the 50-year average. The economy remains healthy enough to support rising home prices.The strength of the US economy is also apparent in the company’s ability to pass on input price increases, which were notable in lumber and copper. Home Depot’s average ticket price was up 5.8 per cent, a big chunk reflecting commodity inflation.Shares in the company traded down more than 1 per cent on Monday. The concern may have been less on the sales miss and more on a 1.3 per cent fall in customer transactions. Quarterly transactions had not fallen in years; Home Depot had seemed to be tapping into millennials, who are belatedly becoming homeowners. But the risk of inflation and monetary tightening are on the horizon, and Home Depot’s assurances sound complacent.

16;HD;Home Depot;2018-05-15T11:47:46Z;Home Depot shares ease as full-year targets miss expectations;;Shares in Home Depot eased in pre-market trading on Tuesday after the company reported lower than expected sales in its first quarter and its full-year guidance fell short of estimates.The world’s biggest home improvement retailer said it expected to report diluted earnings of $9.31 a share in the 12 months ending January 2019, up 28 per cent from the 2018 fiscal year. However, this fell short of the $9.39 a share pencilled in by analysts in a Thomson Reuters survey.The company expects sales growth of 6.7 per cent in its 2019 fiscal year, which now takes into account the adoption of a new accounting standard and implies revenue of $107.6bn. That is about $170m short of market expectations.For its first quarter ended April, Home Depot reported a 4.4 per cent year-on-year rise in revenue to $24.9bn, which was fractionally short of analysts’ expectations, while earnings rose to $2.4bn, or $2.08 a diluted share. That was a 20 per cent increase on a year ago and also ahead of market forecasts.Craig Menear, chairman and chief executive, said:Outside of our seasonal business, we had solid results in all markets and categories and are seeing strong momentum in all lines of business during these first few weeks of May. These trends, as well as a favourable housing and macroeconomic backdrop, give us confidence to reaffirm our sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2018.Home Depot shares were down 2.8 per cent this morning in pre-market trade. Up to Monday’s closing price of $191.08, the stock was up 0.8 per cent for the year to date.
17;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Lowe’s shares skid after earnings miss;US home improvement retailer drops 10% in pre-market trading;Rising home prices and a booming housing market did little to lift Lowe’s during its most recent quarter.Shares in the do-it-yourself home improvement retailer fell more than 10 per cent in pre-market trading on Wednesday after it posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and current year forecasts that both fell short of analyst estimates.Like-for-like sales, a key industry metric, were up 4.1 per cent in the three months to February 2. However weaker margins meant revenue fell 1.8 per cent to $15.49bn. Net income meanwhile dropped 16 per cent to $554m as the margin hit was compounded by charges related to US tax reforms and one-time bonuses for its workers.Stripping these out, adjusted earnings came in at 74 cents per diluted share, compared to the 86 cents recorded in the prior year period and lower than 87 cents a share the market was expecting.Lowe’s also provided its first forecast for the current fiscal year, saying earnings per share will be $5.40 to $5.50 a share. Analysts predicted $6.01 a share on average.“As we enter 2018, we are working diligently to improve execution with a focus on conversion, gross margin, and inventory management,” said chief executive Robert Niblock. “Given the rapidly evolving competitive landscape, we are also accelerating our strategic investments leveraging the benefits of tax reform.”With house prices continuing their steady climb, Americans have been upping their spending on home renovations. But Lowe’s has not benefited as much as rival Home Depot, which has had more success locking in the business of both DIY enthusiasts and professional builders.Last week Atlanta-based Home Depot reported a 7.5 per cent rise in fourth quarter net sales to $23.9bn, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $23.66bn.Shares in both Home Depot and Lowe’s have gained around 26 per cent over the past 12 months.
18;HD;Home Depot;2018-02-20T12:18:42Z;Home Depot posts upbeat results on higher traffic;;Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer has boosted sales the old-fashioned way: by attracting more customers and encouraging them to spend more when they arrive.The Atlanta-based retailer, which has managed to lock in the business of both DIY enthusiasts and professional builders, said its net sales rose 7.5 per cent from a year ago to $23.9bn in the fourth quarter, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $23.66bn. That came as comparable sales rose 7.2 per cent in the US.The results also showed that customer transactions rose 2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter and the average amount spent by customers rose 5.5 per cent from a year ago to $64.Net income rose to $1.78bn or $1.52 a share in the three months ended January 28, compared with $1.74bn or $1.44 a share in the year ago period. The company noted that charges associated with the US tax overhaul and a one-time bonus for hourly associated resulted in a charge of 17 cents a share. Adjusting for these items, earnings of $1.69 a share, topped analysts’ estimates.Home Depot’s results have been boosted by strength in the US housing market as firmer wages and record highs on Wall Street have fuelled spending on homes. Moreover, post hurricane recovery spending in parts of the US that were battered during the Atlantic hurricane season has also helped lift sales at home improvement retailers.Home Depot now expects fiscal 2018 earnings of $9.31 a share, on sales growth of about 6.5 per cent.Shares in Home Depot are down more than 1 per cent so far this year having jumped 41 per cent last year.
19;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;XPO Logistics spikes on report of Home Depot bid interest;;Shares in XPO Logistics jumped more than 10 per cent on Friday after a report said Home Depot could be eyeing a bid for the global logistics and transportation provider.The stock climbed as much as 10.3 per cent to hit a record high of $86.75, giving the company a market value of $10.1bn.The move comes after Recode said home improvement retail giant Home Depot has “held internal discussions” in recent months about a potential bid for XPO. The report, which cited just one source familiar with Home Depot’s thinking, said any offer would be a defensive play, specifically to keep XPO from being taken over by Amazon.Including today’s gains, XPO shares are up nearly 92 per cent over the past 12 months, with the company benefitting from the relentless rise of online shopping and retailers’ need for services to help them deliver the goods to their customers.
20;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;S&P retail index at record high on strong holiday shopping;Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands climbs some 3 per cent as Gap and Amazon also rise;Shares of some of the largest US retailers advanced, propelling the S&P 500 retail sub-index to an all-time high on Monday buoyed by indications of a strong start to the holiday shopping season.Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands climbed more than 3 per cent, while Signet Jewelers, the Gap and Amazon gained more than 1 per cent.Colder weather and pent up demand for new fashion buoyed sales in the days after the Thanksgiving holiday. Analysts with Wells Fargo noted that lower inventory levels heading into the weekend allowed retailers to rein in some of the intense discounting that has weighed on the industry.“Adding a little more fuel to the fire, we believe Black Friday Week was a success that should give investors a little more confidence as we move deeper into the holiday,” said Ike Boruchow, an analyst with the bank. Mr Boruchow, citing ShopperTrak data, that noted foot traffic at malls declined by the least since 2013.The S&P 500 retail index rose as much as 1.3 per cent on Monday to 1,676.53, a new all-time record, before paring its advance to 0.6 per cent. For the year, the index has climbed 24 per cent, outpacing the broader S&P 500. Much of the gains this year have been propelled by companies like Amazon, although Gap, Best Buy and Home Depot are also up more than 25 per cent.Susan Anderson, an analyst with B. Riley FBR, said that customer traffic in Victoria’s Secret, American Eagle Outfitters and Gap-owned Old Navy were among the best she viewed at a mall over the weekend.“We think Thanksgiving-Black Friday was strong even though it continued to be diluted by online sales and earlier sales that began in early November and heightened the weekend before Black Friday,” Ms Anderson added.The advances follow a difficult year for traditional retailers, with many stores labouring under high debt burdens as the threat from online competitors intensifies. Online shopping is expected to eclipse $100bn in sales during the crucial US holiday shopping season this year, according to Adobe Analytics, a 14 per cent jump from the year prior. GBH Insights, a market research firm, estimates that Amazon has captured 45 to 50 per cent of ecommerce sales so far this holiday season.Total sales for the industry over the holiday period are projected to rise by as much as 4 per cent, to $682bn, according to the National Retail Federation.The rise by retailers on Monday contrasted with a tepid day for the broader market, with the S&P 500 flat at 2,601.85. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent lower at 6,877.75 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 23,588.30.
21;HD;Home Depot;2017-11-14T19:00:57Z;Home Depot: touch wood;Millennials are starting to get their hands dirty;American millennials are developing a taste for home ownership rivalled only by their taste for avocado toast. But this is a generation with thumbs adapted for texting, not gripping tools. Home Depot’s classes on household improvement have thus been a magnet for 20- and 30-year-olds intent on learning how to hold a hammer.While the kids start putting on their tool belts, a steady US economy and a housing market have made Home Depot a rare bright spot in the American retail landscape. Its shares are up 25 per cent so far in 2017. On Tuesday it reported hearty US like-for-like sales growth in the third quarter of 7.7 per cent, slightly boosted by hurricane rebuilding efforts. There is no better avatar for the calm of the US financial markets than Home Depot.Since the beginning of 2016, comparable sales at Home Depot have not fallen below 4.7 per cent. Its return on total invested capital is well above 30 per cent, allowing its dividend to double in the past three years. Still, the company thinks there is room for expansion. Over the long term, household formation has averaged 1.2m annually but has been subpar for several years. Similarly, private fixed residential investment has typically been 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product a year, but lower during this economic expansion. Home Depot’s strong top line most recently has been driven by its offering to professional contractors rather than do-it-yourself consumers.Home Depot thinks its customer service will attract millennials to its physical locations instead of using Amazon. Still, it has its own online presence and as millennials become the bulk of homebuyers it remains to be seen how their shopping preferences evolve. The puts and takes of tax reform and tightening monetary policy are ever-present concerns.Importantly, the forward earnings multiple has not raced away, staying around 20 times in the past two years and underpinned by earnings growth.

22;HD;Home Depot;2017-11-14T11:33:24Z;Home Depot quarterly results beat Wall St estimates;;Home Depot on Tuesday posted a bigger than expected increase in its fiscal third quarter profits and sales, leading the world’s biggest home improvement retailer to boost its full year outlook.Net revenues in the three months to October 29 climbed 8.1 per cent to $25bn, exceeding the consensus estimate in a Reuters poll of $24.6bn. Like for like sales, an important metric for retailers, were up 7.9 over the period, with growth of 7.7 per cent in the US, its biggest market.On the bottom line, net income advanced 10 per cent to $2.17bn. Earnings per share of $1.84 topped Wall Street estimates by two cents.A series of hurricanes that hit the US boosted comparable store sales growth by $282m as professional and retail customers spent money to repair property that was damaged. But the hurricanes also caused Home Depot to incur a hurricane-related expense of $104m. The gross margin on hurricane-related sales was also “considerably less” than the company average.“Though this quarter was marked by an unprecedented number of natural disasters, including multiple hurricanes, wildfires in the West, and earthquakes in Mexico, the underlying health of our core business remains solid,” said Craig Menear, chairman and chief executive.Home Depot has had a strong run this year as a tightening labour market and a historically low level of homes on the market has prompted consumers to spend more on their houses. The types of items that the group sells, such as lumber and appliances, has also shielded it from e-commerce competition from Amazon that has roiled other retailers.The shares have jumped by almost a quarter this year, or roughly 12 percentage points better than the benchmark S&P 500 index. The shares added an additional 1.8 per cent in light pre-market trading in New York.For the full fiscal year 2017, Home Depot said it now expects revenues will rise 6.3 per cent, with comparable sales growing 6.5 per cent. In August, Home Depot projected growth of 5.3 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively.Earnings per share are seen rising 14 per cent year on year to $7.36, compared with the August estimate of $7.29.Image source: Getty
23;HD;Home Depot;2017-10-27T04:25:01Z;Silicon Valley disrupts your light switch on its return to the smart home;Amazon’s Echo and Google Home have rekindled excitement in connected devices;From music and books to telephones and taxis, Silicon Valley companies have upended countless products and markets over the years. Noon Home, a start-up launching this week, has a more prosaic ambition: it wants to disrupt the light switch.“The switch has been around for 100 years now, but it’s not sexy or engaging,” says Noon chief executive Erik Charlton. The Cupertino-based start-up has raised $50m from some of the same venture capitalists behind Nest — the Alphabet-owned maker of smart thermostats and cameras — for its customisable lighting system, which plugs into existing bulbs and fixtures. While Noon’s proposition remains unproven, its well-financed debut is the latest indication that Silicon Valley is getting excited about the “smart home” again. The concept of giving everyday household appliances cloud-enabled capabilities has rapidly passed through the Silicon Valley “hype cycle” of initial frenzy followed by steady deflation. After Nest’s $3.2bn takeover by Google in 2014, there was a spurt in growth in the number of connected devices targeting the home, from smart sprinklers to intelligent toothbrushes. However, many sank without trace and, until a few months ago, Nest itself seemed to have lost momentum after the departure of co-founder Tony Fadell last year. Now, the growing popularity of “smart speakers” such as Amazon’s Echo and Google Home has helped to rekindle excitement, because of the ease of having a central hub that can be controlled just by speaking. “There is no doubt in my mind that the Echo has been a major catalyst,” says Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies. “It’s just a question of what other products start to take off and really stick.”Noon’s $400 “smart lighting system” is one of those hoping to tap into Amazon’s Alexa platform. Its “Room Director” incorporates an OLED display — the same kind of touchscreen technology used in the new iPhone X — and bulb-detecting algorithms to create “layered lighting”, with an array of scenes and moods. Noon’s $50m funding is large for a company that, until Thursday’s debut in US stores, had not begun to sell any products. Its backers argue the sum reflects the capital costs of building a high-quality consumer product, as well as the scale of the opportunity: 144m residential light switches are sold every year, Mr Charlton notes. “It is one of these unloved, overlooked products that has relatively boring incumbents that haven’t paid attention to the needs of the market,” says Rob Coneybeer, partner at Shasta Ventures, one of Noon’s earlier investors. “You probably hit a light switch at least 10 times a day. The only other product that has that level of engagement in your life is your smartphone.” There are few simpler technologies in the home than the humble light switch, which for most people works reliably without the addition of WiFi or Bluetooth. To those who might insist that the light switch does not need improving, Mr Coneybeer — who previously backed Nest — argues that the same complaint was levelled at smart thermostats. Now, the ability to programme heating and air conditioning from a smartphone, with a device that also learns from a homeowner’s habits, has established a benchmark for the domestic “internet of things”, selling millions of units. “There has been a race to mainstream the smart home before it was ready,” says Mr Charlton. “What I fundamentally believe is, I don’t want to create amphibious cars and I don’t want to invent new product categories.”Even if adapting an existing feature of the home is an easier sell to consumers, the risks for any small hardware maker are high. Capital costs are steep and it could easily find itself competing against the seemingly bottomless resources of Amazon or Google. “It’s a very, very challenging space for start-ups,” Mr Coneybeer says. “The product has to be perfectly polished.”The potential prize, though, is large and growing quickly. IHS Markit, the market researcher, estimates that the North American market for connected home devices will more than double year on year to $7bn in 2017, rising to $35bn by 2021. Yet it remains very fragmented, says Blake Kozak, analyst at IHS Markit. “There are so many players in the smart home today, it’s become incredibly crowded,” he says. “Companies have to be creative to gain and maintain share.” One breakout from that pack is Ring, the Los Angeles-based maker of video-enabled doorbells. With more than 1m customers, Ring has raised more than $200m in venture capital funding from investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers and Draper Fisher Jurvetson.“The smart home is happening,” Ring chief Jamie Siminoff told the Financial Times in an interview earlier this year. “What’s not happening is 15 major new companies in this space. I don’t think you’re going to see that.” The relatively few successes for venture-backed companies in the market has put many early-stage investors off, says Jeff Clavier, a partner at SoftTech VC. Besides Nest, the “jury is still out” on the market’s potential for start-ups, he says. “Everything in this market today is still small, in terms of the number of households that have been penetrated . . . It’s a very tricky space to invest.”Mr Clavier was a backer of August, a maker of “smart locks” that was recently acquired by Assa Abloy, which owns Yale, for an undisclosed sum. August’s sales next year are expected to be $60m. “We were thrilled for the outcome that August had but it hadn’t scaled yet in terms of market penetration,” Mr Clavier says. An August lock’s wireless connection allows doors to unlock automatically as a homeowner approaches, by connecting to their smartphone, and the company has expanded into video-camera doorbells to compete with Ring.This week, Amazon announced it would work with Yale locks to introduce its new $250 Key system, which allows its drivers to open a Prime customer’s front door if they are not home to receive a delivery. August, which is not an initial partner of Amazon Key, had been trialling a similar “in-home” delivery service with Walmart. These services go beyond mere gadgetry to give connected devices a more tangible use — even if some customers might be nervous about the privacy and security implications. Such developments meant the “timing was right” for the August buy, says Thanasis Molokotos, head of Assa Abloy’s Americas division. “This is not a market where you want to hesitate.” While praising August’s “high-quality product and cutting-edge technology”, Mr Molokotos acknowledges: “There is a lot of junk in the market.” Despite the renewed momentum and investment, some remain concerned that too many smart home devices are solutions in search of a real problem. “Now you can control your lights with your cell phone — but why the hell would I want to do that? It makes my life more complex,” says Mr Clavier. “Just because you can build the product doesn’t mean you should.”Three years after Google’s blockbuster Nest acquisition, Silicon Valley’s biggest companies are starting to modify their strategies as the smart home market moves into its next phase. AMAZONMany smart home devices have piggybacked on the popularity of Amazon’s Echo, using Alexa to turn out lights, lock doors or turn up the heating. With the launch of its new Cloud Cam internet security camera, Amazon has shown that it is not afraid to launch its own version of the Alexa-enabled products it sees are becoming popular. “They will try to commoditise as many bits of the smart home as possible,” says Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies, who suggests they may one day launch low-cost alternatives to Philips Hue lightbulbs or Belkin Wemo plugs. “Once there is enough volume, they will ‘Amazon Basics’ it.”ALPHABETNest is one of Alphabet’s “other bets”, meaning it is run independently from the main Google business. That has begun to change as Google introduces more of its own hardware, including its Pixel smartphones and Home smart speakers.Nest’s new home security system, which includes a connected doorbell similar to Ring’s, integrates with Google’s voice-activated Assistant, while its video feed can also be viewed on a television set via Chromecast. Nest chief Marwan Fawaz and Google hardware boss Rick Osterloh previously worked together at Motorola. “Nest used to rely on [third-party] ‘Works with Nest’ products,” says Blake Kozak, analyst at IHS Markit. “Now they are building their own ecosystem.”APPLEApple is trying to make it easier for other hardware makers to build on top of its smart home platform, Homekit, which allows devices to be controlled via Siri or shortcuts in iOS.When Homekit first launched in 2014, Apple required any devices wanting to support it to use a specific wireless chip, to ensure reliability and security. With the introduction of iOS 11 in September, manufacturers can tie in to Homekit using just software, reducing the cost and complexity of integration. It remains to be seen whether its music-focused HomePod speaker, which will be released in December, will compete head-on with Amazon’s Echo as a smart home hub.

Canadian gold miners also took a hit, with Franco-Nevada dipping 0.5 per cent and Goldcorp nudged 0.9 per cent lower.Two popular exchange traded funds that invest in gold miners were dragged down by the sector’s broad decline.The $8.4bn VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF fell 1.5 per cent, while its $4.4bn “junior” counterpart, which invests in smaller miners of the lustrous metal, edged 1.1 per cent lower. GLD, the biggest ETF that tracks the physical metal, also declined 1.1 per cent.The poor performance of gold miners stood in sharp contrast to the rest of Wall Street, with every major sector rallying on Monday and the S&P 500 heading towards a new record close by midday in New York.Insurance stocks led the rally, thanks to the ebbing fears of mass destruction in Florida.Materials stocks enjoyed a 1 per cent bounce but the jump was powered by chemicals companies rather than construction materials companies, such as Martin Marietta Materials and Vulcan Materials, as investors pared back their estimate for how much rebuilding work will be needed in Texas and Florida after hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Martin Marrietta and Vulcan fell 2.7 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively, by midday on Monday.Home Depot also dipped 1.5 per cent and the SPDR Homebuilders ETF fell 0.4 per cent, after both had climbed strongly earlier this month as the storm clouds gathered.Goldman Sachs at the weekend lowered its third-quarter economic growth estimate by 0.8 per cent to 2 per cent but stressed that it expected this weakness to be reversed over the following three quarters, as rebuilding efforts stimulates the economy and eventually “more than recouping the lost output”.

Adjusted profits that exclude the gain from the sale of its interest in an Australian joint venture came in at $1.57 per share, missing Wall Street forecasts of $1.62.On the top line, Lowe’s said its revenues climbed 6.8 per cent to $19.5bn, matching estimates. Like-for-like sales, an important industry metric, rose 4.5 per cent.Home Depot last week disclosed both quarterly earnings and sales that topped estimates, giving it the confidence to boost its 2017 outlook.The news on Wednesday from Lowe’s sent the group’s shares down 6.4 per cent in pre-market trading.“While our results were below our expectations in the first half of this year, the team remains focused on making the necessary investments to improve the customer experience and drive sales,” said Robert Niblock, chief executive.For the full fiscal year, Lowe’s said it expects its sales to be up 5 per cent, close to analyst estimates.Image: APRelated reading:
DIY retailers: Lowe’s trailing Home Depot in home-improvement boom"
26;HD;Home Depot;2017-08-17T16:17:46Z;Kingfisher: hardware, hard knocks;B&Q owner needs running repairs of its own;Five-Year Plans, Soviet blueprints for industrial progress, were the subject of regular progress reports. So too at Kingfisher, which has a Five-Year Plan of its own. Sadly, the FTSE 100 home improvements retailer was unable to provide the equivalent of target-beating tractor output on Thursday. Instead, sales fell for the second successive quarter year on year. The do-it-yourself specialist needs running repairs of its own.The shares dropped 4.5 per cent after a 1.9 per cent slippage in same-store sales. That might look like an overreaction, given that Kingfisher had approved prior full-year forecasts. The difficulty is that too little changes at this mature business. Investor trust is flaking away like badly mixed cement.The first constant is patchy demand for screws, drills and other kit for would-be handypeople. A French division has been a perennial underperformer. In the UK, weakening house price growth and sluggish wage increases look ominous for B&Q. The bright spark in the gloom is Screwfix, a UK chain that sell tools and fixings over the counter to customers who buy without browsing. But it is hard to believe Screwfix is not cannibalising sales from B&Q, to which it is superior.The second constant is Kingfisher’s ambition to save money by carrying a unified range across its stores. This is one over-familiar strand in the Five-Year Plan of chief executive Veronique Laury. This is meant to add £500m to underlying profits by 2020-21, taking them from £700m to around £1.2bn.Raising sales some 20 per cent to £12.5bn would add £200m, at today’s operating margin of 7 per cent. The remainder would come from lifting that margin to 10 per cent.Home Depot of the US already extracts a better percentage. But investors doubt Ms Laury’s ability to deliver. The shares trade at a depressed 11 times forward earnings. Nobody is confident a DIYer will finish a job until they are making good progress with it. The same applies to Ms Laury.Join Lex for a live Facebook discussion on Trump, robot surgeons and activists on Friday (3pm BST, 10am EDT) at: https://www.facebook.com/financialtimes/
27;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Dick’s Sporting Goods lead retail shares lower;Corporate earnings from big companies paint mixed picture of US retail and sales online;A new crop of earnings data on Tuesday painted a mixed picture of the US retail landscape, revealing who is withstanding the rise of ecommerce and who is suffering from changing shopping patterns. Dick’s Sporting Goods and Coach were the latest to reveal disappointing results, but TJX Cos and Home Depot reported more benign second quarter figures, on the same day that the government’s latest monthly retail sales data showed the American consumer remains healthy overall.US retail sales rose in July by the most in seven months — 0.6 per cent over June compared to Wall Street expectations of 0.3 per cent. Sales were led by a 1.3 per cent increase in “nonstore retailers”, reflecting the shift online. Dick’s Sporting Goods, the Pittsburgh-based sports store, sharply lowered its earnings and sales outlook on Tuesday, sending shares tumbling more than 20 per cent and poised for their steepest one-day decline on record. While athleisure, a term used to describe people’s habit of wearing workout gear outside of the gym, had helped sports retailers buck some of the broader industry pain, Dick’s Sporting Goods and rival The Sports Authority have had a tough time as competition heats up from online retailers. “Disruption in the space is profound,” said Jim Duffy, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, noting that Dick’s Sporting Goods is losing control of pricing, undermining profits. The company warned that comparable sales could decline in the low single digits or stay flat this year, where previously it had expected them to rise by 1 to 3 per cent. Edward Stack, chief executive, said the company plans to spend more on marketing to “aggressively protect” market share. Coach also warned its sales in the current fiscal year may come in below Wall Street expectations, sending shares in the the luxury handbag and accessories maker down 14 per cent in lunchtime trading in New York. Sales have been hit by steep discounting in department stores where Coach generated a good chunk of its revenue, as well as shifting consumer preference for clothing and accessories that do not have conspicuous labels or logos. Retailers perceived to be less vulnerable to ecommerce defied the gloom. TJX Cos reported that same-store sales grew more than expected in the second quarter, as the discount retailer behind stores like TJ Maxx and Marshalls lured more customers to its stores. The chain, which offers designer goods at a fraction of the cost, lifted its full-year earnings outlook and said net sales rose 6 per cent to $8.4bn, beating Wall Street expectations of $8.3bn. TJX is “benefiting from department store closings”, said Paul Lejuez, analyst at Citi, as its business model “remains fairly well-insulated from the online threat”. Home Depot also bucked the malaise, unveiling quarterly results that beat analyst estimates and raising its sales forecast for the fiscal year. The biggest US home improvement retailer is benefiting from a robust US housing market, while some of its products, such as lumber, tend to be much less susceptible to competition from the likes of Amazon.
28;HD;Home Depot;2017-08-15T14:51:22Z;US stocks struggle for direction as investors digest data, earnings;;US stocks struggled to extend their gains from the previous session on Tuesday as investors digested upbeat economic data and a mixed batch of results.A day after clocking its best day since April, the S&P 500 wavered between minor gains and losses and was down 1 points at 2,464.82 by mid-morning in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also largely unchanged at 21,998.44 while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1 per cent to 6,336.89.The lacklustre moves come after a mixed batch of results that showed companies like home improvement store Home Depot, and off-price chain TJX Cos posting better-than-expected results and bucking the retail pain, while those like Dick’s Sporting Goods and Coach slipped after disappointing markets.Investors also digested a batch of upbeat economic data that showed US retail sales increasing in July by the fastest clip since December. A separate survey of manufacturers in the New York region saw the gauge hitting its highest level in nearly 3 years while homebuilder confidence rose by more than expected in August. The data could strengthen the case for the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates for a third time this year.The data helped send the US dollar sharply higher and Treasury yields climbing. The dollar index, a gauge of the buck against a basket of peers, surging as much as 0.7 per cent to 94.14 to its highest level in nearly 2 weeks. Meanwhile, the yield on the US 10-year, which moves inversely to price, rose 3.9 basis points to 2.257 per cent.
29;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Home Depot lifts 2017 outlook, bucking retail gloom;;Home Depot disclosed on Tuesday quarterly results that beat analyst estimates, prompting the biggest US home improvement retailer to lift its 2017 guidance as it continues to buck the malaise across the American retail landscape.The group said in a statement that it now expects its like-for-like sales, a key industry metric, to climb 5.5 per cent in the current fiscal year, up from its previous target of 4.6 per cent. Earnings per share are now expected to rise 13 per cent on a year-on-year basis, up by 2 percentage points from a May prediction.Home Depot has cashed-in on a robust US housing market that has seen consumers invest in their homes. Analysts have also said that some of the items that Home Depot markets, such as lumber, tend to be much less susceptible to competition from Amazon, the online behemoth that has leached sales from traditional retailers, like as Macy’s and Sears Holdings.“We were pleased with our results this quarter as our customers rewarded us with the highest quarterly sales in company history,” said Craig Menear, chief executive.In the quarter to July 30 global comparable-store sales rose 6.3 per cent, with the metric up 6.6 per cent in America. Analysts had projected worldwide comparable sales growth of 4.9 per cent, according to Bloomberg data.Overall revenues climbed 6.2 per cent to $28.1bn, beating expectations of $27.8bn. Profits rose to $2.7bn, or $2.25 a share, compared with earnings of $2.4bn , or $1.97 per share, in the same period in 2016. That also topped Street views of earnings per share of $2.21.Shares rose 2.2 per cent in pre-market trading.
30;HD;Home Depot;2017-07-20T18:43:14Z;Wall St comes to Home Depot’s defence after Amazon-Sears deal;;Wall Street has come to the defence of Home Depot, America’s biggest home improvement chain, after worries over competition from Amazon knocked billions from its market market value on Thursday in a matter of minutes.After news that Sears, the beleaguered retailer, had struck a deal to sell its proprietary Kenmore appliances through Amazon, traders fled shares of Home Depot, its rival Lowe’s, and Best Buy — all groups that sell similar products. The abrupt move sapped some $13bn from the market value of the trio, underscoring investor anxiety of the pact.It also represented a setback for the Street, which is quite bullish on Home Depot. In a Bloomberg survey of analysts, 20 have “buy” ratings, and none hold “sell” ratings. The median price target for Home Depot is about $174, a mark that has become more difficult to hit after a $6.10 decline on Thursday brought the price to $147.24.From the looks of it, though, the sell-side has not fled the bull camp, with a parade of investment bank analysts having issued notes to their clients advising them to remain calm.“We are buy rated on both Home Depot and Lowe’s and are buying this dip,” said Stifel analyst John Baugh. He adds that “when asked months ago about the desire to buy the Kenmore name, the CEO of Home Depot stated emphatically they had no interest. ”Christopher Horvers at JPMorgan Chase also advises buying the Home Depot dip, saying that “the cache of Kenmore is gone … and thus we don’t think this has a material impact on Home Depot’s, Lowe’s and Best Buy’s [market share] capture ability.”Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer offered a similar perspective, saying that the deal would be “more likely to keep Kenmore alive, even as Sears continues to falter, than pump new life into the legacy brand.”At RBC Capital Markets, Scot Ciccarelli is also sceptical about what he sees as an “exaggerated” reaction to a “relatively modest incremental risk”. He adds:The Kenmore brand/image has been heavily damaged over the last several years. Historically, consumer impressions regarding brand quality change at a glacial pace. So even with the positive aura that Amazon distribution may provide, we find it hard to believe there will be much of a change in the product’s sales trajectory.Most white goods (think washers, dryers, dishwashers and typically refrigerators) still need to be installed by specialists. These are not typically [do-it-yourself] purchases. The solution here is that Sears Home Services would provide the installation, but Sears is an even more damaged brand than Kenmore, which may make consumers hesitant to use the service.Peter Benedict of Robert W. Baird also reckons the sell-off for Home Depot and Lowe’s represents a “buying opportunity.” He notes that Home Depot’s market value decline represents more than 100 per cent of annual appliance sales.
31;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;DIY retailers: Lowe’s trailing Home Depot in home-improvement boom;;Do-it-yourself home improvement retailers have been a bright spot in the recent retail doom and gloom.But a tale of ‘haves and have less’ is playing out there as Lowe’s continues to fall behind its larger rival Home Depot.Lowe’s shares fell 3 per cent to $79.82 on Wednesday after the 60-year old retailer said its like-for-like sales, a key industry metric, rose just 1.9 per cent in the fiscal first quarter, falling short of Wall Street estimates for 2.6 per cent growth. In the US, comparable sales were up 2 per cent. And its net sales rose nearly 11 per cent from a year ago to $16.9bn, just shy of estimates.By comparison, Home Depot said its total comparable-store sales rose 5.5 per cent in the first quarter, eclipsing estimates for 3.9 per cent growth and up 6 per cent domestically, when it reported results last week. Its net sales rose 5 per cent to $23.9bn, ahead of estimates.Indeed, since 2011, Lowe’s has only on two occasions posted stronger same-store sales growth than Home Depot. The comp gap between the two companies widened by the most in four years in the first quarter, said Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets said, while noting that it narrowed “a touch” on a 2-year basis.This is not to say Lowe’s is doing badly. Both retailers have benefited from strength in the US housing market — with strong job growth and improving wage gains supporting home purchases and prices — that has driven homeowners to spruce up their properties.But Home Depot has capitalised on both the DIY consumer and the professional customer. While professionals account for a much smaller portion of its customer base, they make up about 40 per cent of its sales.Home Depot said its pro sales outpaced its DIY sales again in the latest quarter. The company has locked in pro customers by strengthening its sales support and product assortment for professional contractors, and through offerings like its in-store tool rental business. Moreover, Home Depot helps the pros connect with customers through its pro referral programLowe’s has been trying to catch up on this front, with its recent move to acquire Maintenance Supply Headquarters, a distributor of maintenance, repair and operations to reach professionals working in the multi-family housing, or apartment space, in the southeast, south central and western parts of the US.In its most recent quarter, the company noted that it captured sales to the pros through exclusive offerings of Hitachi and Bostitch products. It also plans to add SharkBite and AO Smith, known for their plumbing fittings and residential water heaters respectively.While both Lowe’s and Home Depot have enjoyed the home renovation boom, investors appear to have picked favourites. Lowe’s shares are up 12 per cent so far this year, while rival Home Depot has seen its shares up nearly 16 per cent over the same period.
32;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Home Depot provides light in broader US retail gloom;Sales at house improvement retailer show strength as department stores falter;In the middle of the retail doom and gloom, some hope: Americans may have reined in spending at department stores but they are still investing in their homes, the sector’s results showed on Tuesday.DIY home improvement retailer Home Depot added $1.1bn, or 0.6 per cent, to its market value by the close of trade on Tuesday after posting upbeat sales, at a time when retailers have been rattled by concerns over falling foot traffic, sliding sales and the threat from online competitors that saw investors erase $4.8bn, or 17.2 per cent, from the market value of the US department store sector since Thursday when Macy’s opened the earnings season for retailers.Home Depot’s growth comes as Americans continue to spruce up their homes as house prices in the US have continued to march higher. Indeed, the Atlanta-based company, which has managed to lock in the business of both consumers and professionals like contractors and builders, said its comparable sales, a key industry metric, rose 5.5 per cent in the first quarter. These eclipsed Wall Street’s expectations and sent its shares 0.6 per cent higher to $158.26.“Once again Home Depot gave the market a needed hug following unsettling reports from department stores last week,” said Christopher Horvers at JPMorgan.But the retail bears chalked up a few points as well, as TJX Cos, which scoops up excess designer inventory at discounted prices and had so far been a bright spot among retailers, said its same-store sales grew at the slowest pace in three years.Once again Home Depot gave the market a needed hug following unsettling reports from department stores last weekHowever, the sell-off in TJX shares moderated from 5 per cent to about 4.1 per cent as investors parsed the results that showed that the company behind stores such as TJ Maxx and Marshalls had much harder comparisons than its rivals, with comparable sales up 7 per cent in the year-earlier quarter.Moreover, analysts reiterated that the company was less vulnerable to online competitors with Oliver Chen at Cowen noting the group was “Un-Amazon-Able given that customers engage in an in-store treasure hunt”.Elsewhere, weaker than expected same-store sales at Dick’s Sporting Goods, considered the best name among sports retailers, and a decline in sales at Staples, sent shares in both companies sliding, reflecting investor anxiety over brick-and-mortar retailing. Dick’s tumbled 13.7 per cent to $41.04, while Staples retreated 3.5 per cent to $8.99.“Last week we got earnings from [market] share donors, this was supposed to be a week of earnings from department store beneficiaries — the so-called retail safe havens,” said Simeon Siegel at Nomura’s Instinet. “The reality is there are very much a group of have and have-nots and it has played out accordingly.”mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

That also beat analysts’ estimates for earnings of $1.61 a share.“We were pleased with our results as they reflected broad-based growth across our interconnected platform and all geographies,” chief executive Craig Menear, said.The upbeat results come as tight inventory of homes for sale and rising US home prices continue prompt Americans to spruce up their homes. Indeed, a measure of homebuilder confidence rebounded in May, data on Monday showed.Home Depot shares, which are up 17 per cent so far this year, rose nearly 2 per cent in pre-market trade.

Home Depot’s stock has risen 6.6 per cent so far this year.Commenting on the figures, Home Depot chairman, chief executive and president Craig Menear said that the year had seen a “healthy housing market and strong customer demand”.The company said it expects sales to grow a further 4.6 per cent this year.

Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Expectations that president-elect Donald Trump’s plans for a major fiscal stimulus would drive up inflation and long-term interest rates prompted the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to jump 37 basis points last week.Mortgage rates have followed with the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage hitting the psychologically important barrier of 4 per cent on Monday, according to MortgageNewsDaily.com.A sustained rise in borrowing costs is fuelling fears in the market that this could put off first-time buyers, many of whom are already having to contend with high house prices in the country’s big cities.Shares in rival Lowe’s were 1.4 per cent lower at $69.05 while homebuilder KB Home — which has been benefiting from the return of first-time buyers this year — fell 0.7 per cent to $15.62.Elsewhere, TJX Cos shares were in retreat after the off-price retailer behind department stores like TJ Maxx and Marshalls cautioned its earnings in the final quarter of the year will be held back by wage increases and the strength of the dollar.Although its sales performance in the third quarter beat expectations as it attracted more shoppers through the doors of its outlets, the company warned wage pressure would hurt earnings per share in the fourth quarter by about 3 per cent.It said earnings per share are expected to dip to 96-98 cents in the final three months of the year from 99 cents a year ago.TJX tweaked its full-year guidance in its latest trading update, forecasting earnings per share of between $3.39 and $3.41 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.46 to $3.48, versus previous guidance of $3.39 to $3.43.Shares in the group, up more than 15 per cent over the past 12 months, fell 1 per cent to $73.49.In the wider market, US stocks made ground on Tuesday as the rally following Mr Trump’s presidential election victory last week regained some of its momentum.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has ended higher for the past six sessions — three of which saw the index hit record highs — rose a further 0.3 per cent to 18,923.1. The S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent at 2,180.4 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.1 per cent to 5,275.6.

But it has nudged up its guidance for diluted earnings per share to growth of 15.9 per cent to $6.33.In August, the company revised up its full year EPS guidance to suggest that growth would be in the order of 15.6 per cent year-on-year to $6.31.Craig Menear, chief executive of Home Depot, said:We experienced balanced sales growth in the quarter driven by an increase in both ticket and transactions, and our continued focus on productivity drove double-digit earnings-per-share growth.

Its earnings outlook in the range of 15 to 16 cents a share was also below its previous estimates and analysts’ expectations for 18 cents.Fortinet also said it expects billings in the range of $343m to $348m compared to its previous guidance of $372m to $376m.The company said customers have been more “strategic in their purchases,” taking longer to make purchasing decisions or buying only what they immediately need, in the wake of “elevated” purchases in 2015. Since 2014, there have been data breaches at companies as varied as EBay, JPMorgan, Home Depot, Anthem, Sony and Yahoo, to name a few.The company also said that it had been impacted by “economic challenges of the Brexit in the UK, as well as the ongoing geopolitical issue and turmoil in Latin America”.Fortinet’s profit warning also saw investors sour on rival cyber security providers.

That was shy of the 0.4 per cent growth that analysts had forecast.The company said like-for-like sales from digital channels rose 20 per cent, while those at its physical stores declined in the low single-digit range.The New Jersey-based company said profits slid to $167.3m or $1.11 a share, compared with $201.7m or $1.21 a share in the year ago period. Sales slipped 0.2 per cent to $3bn.Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.16 a share, on sales of $3.1bn.DIY chains like Home Depot have benefited from the ongoing US housing recovery but Bed Bath & Beyond, which was late to the e-commerce game and has been playing catch up, has faced increasing competition from online competitors.Shares in the retailer, which have declined nearly 11 per cent so far this year, fell as much as 4.5 per cent in extended trading before paring its losses.

Net income came in at $1.16bn, or $1.31 per diluted share.The results failed to match those from Home Depot, which met analysts’ expectations and raised its full-year earnings guidance on Tuesday.Lowe’s is not the only high-flyer whose shares are suffering a reversal of fortunes. Target, another recent outperformer in the retail sector, fell 6.4 per cent to a six-week low of $70.63 after it cut its earnings guidance for the year.Urban Outfitters by contrast surged 15.4 per cent to $36.05 as investors cheered signs that the aggressive markdowns that the Philadelphia-based group has been using to draw in shoppers through its doors could finally be abating. The company behind Anthropologie, Free People and its eponymous brand was the day’s biggest riser on the S&P 500 after it reported a bigger-than-expected rise in second-quarter sales and profit on Tuesday.Away from retail, the wider stock market remains preoccupied with the timing of the next US interest rate rise. Consumer discretionary stocks — which have until recently benefited from investors’ search for yield — led the decline in the broader market after comments from New York Fed president William Dudley prompted investors to reconsider the odds of a rate rise this year.Stocks changed course after the release of the minutes of the Fed’s July meeting. At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent to 2,182.2 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.1 per cent to 18,573.9. The Nasdaq Composite was little-changed at 5,228.7.
41;HD;Home Depot;2016-08-17T10:59:45Z;Lowe’s loses edge to Home Depot in DIY war;;In the two-horse race for DIY retail supremacy, Lowe’s appears to be losing its edge.Lowe’s, the second biggest home improvement chain after rival Home Depot, reported sales and earnings that badly undershot the high bar set by Wall Street, prompting shares in the $72bn company to tumble nearly 7 per cent in pre-market trading.Both companies have been benefiting from the rebound in the US housing market since national prices touched a bottom in the middle of 2012 and have been reporting steady rise in sales – in contrast to the wider gloom that has enveloped the wider US retail sector.But Lowe’s second quarter results suggest that it is falling behind Home Depot when it comes to capitalising on homeowners’ continued appetite to spend on home improvement.For the quarter to end of July, like-for-like sales at the North Carolina-based chain rose 2 per cent – well below the 4.1 per cent analysts were predicting and the 4.7 per cent gain reported by Home Depot on Tuesday.Net sales also rose less than expecting, climbing 5.2 per cent to $18.2bn, against expectations for a rise to $18.4bn. Net income came in at $1.16bn or $1.31 per diluted share.The results contrast with those from Home Depot, which met analysts’ expectations and raised its full year earnings guidance yesterday.
42;HD;Home Depot;2016-08-17T10:51:16Z;Target cuts earnings outlook as discount war bites;;Target suffered its first quarterly decline in like-for-like sales in more than two years as intense discounting by rival retailers drew shoppers away and forced the company to cut its full year earnings guidance.Sales at stores that have been open for more than a year fell 1.1 per cent during the three months to end of July – Target’s second quarter. The figure is worse than the 1 per cent drop the market was expecting, and represents a rare setback for chief executive Brian Cornell, who has engineered a remarkable turnaround of the group since taking over two years ago.The company, which warned it was facing “a difficult retail environment”, said it now expected adjusted earnings per share to come in at between $4.80 to $5.20, compared to its previous guidance of $5.20 to $5.40.Under Mr Cornell, an aggressive push into online sales, coupled with a renewed focus on building up its cheap and chic offerings, have up until now helped Target avoid the kind of sales slump seen across rivals Macy’s, Nordstrom, and Sears over the past year.But in a sign that the sector’s aggressive price cutting and promotional activities are finally taking a toll on business, total group sales fell 7.2 per cent during the quarter to $16.1bn, below the $16.2bn forecast. Net income also dropped by a bigger than expected 9.7 per cent to $680m as gross margins declined 5.7 per cent.Shares in the company were down 5.3 per cent in pre-market trading.The stock has already taken a tumble earlier this month after analysts at Cleveland Research lowered its forecasts for same-store sales and earnings, citing softening customer traffic in July.“Our updated work indicates traffic slowed in July despite more aggressive promotions as the company appears to be losing share in grocery and seeing weakness in discretionary/signature categories,” the firm said in a note.“Sales do not seem be improving to start the fiscal third quarter and Target will likely have to remain more aggressive on promotions than originally planned in order to stabilize traffic.”
43;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Home Depot raises earnings guidance (again);;The jury may still be out over the health of the wider US retail sector but Home Depot has upped its full year earnings per share guidance for a second time as Americans continue to spend on upgrading their homes.The group, which has more than 2,200 stores across the US, reported second quarter net earnings bang in line with estimates, of $1.97 per share, up from $1.73 during the same period a year ago. Comparable sales, an important metric for retailers, rose 4.7 per cent overall and by 5.4 per cent in the US.Total revenues rose 6.6 per cent to $26.5bn, also matching Wall Street estimates.The world’s biggest home improvement retailer said it is expecting full year comparable sales to rise 4.9 per cent and total sales to be 6.3 per cent higher – in line with previous guidance – but upped its forecast for diluted earnings per share. It is now expecting diluted EPS to grow 15.6 per cent to $6.31, compared with a previous forecast in May of $6.27. The company had already raised its guidance in May.It had originally forecast much weaker sales growth for 2016 of between 5.1 per cent to 6 per cent and comparable sales growth of between 3.7 per cent and 4.5 per cent, plus EPS growth of 12-13 per cent.Craig Menear, chief executive of Home Depot, said the group achieved the highest quarterly sales and net earnings results in its 38 year history in the latest quarter:We had a solid quarter, achieving the highest quarterly sales and net earnings results in company history as housing continues to be a tailwind for our businessThe shares were relatively flat in pre-market trading.
44;HD;Home Depot;2016-05-26T11:21:10Z;Sears losses widen, explores options for parts of business;;Sears has become the latest department store to be swept up in the malaise dragging down the US retail industry after it reported bigger than expected sales decline and losses and announced that it was exploring options for parts of its business.Sears also said its chief financial officer Robert Schriesheim was leaving the company.The troubled Illinois-based department store, which has not reported quarterly revenue growth since 2007, said sales fell more than 8 per cent – or $488m – to $5.4bn during the first quarter. The drop was driven primarily by the 6.1 per cent decline in comparable sales and underscores the difficulty the company has had in winning back customers.Heavy discounting also took its toll on the company’s top and bottom lines. Its gross margin rate fell to 21.8 per cent, from 25.8 per cent a year earlier.This helped widen losses for the quarter to $471m, or $4.41 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $303m, or $2.85 per diluted share in the prior year period.The results follow disappointing results from Macy’s, Nordstrom and Kohl’s, as US department stores have come under pressure from e-commerce competitors like Amazon and off-price retailers, like TJX Cos, that offer branded clothing at a discount.But analysts say that lacklustre results are not a reflection on the wider health of the US consumer, pointing to strength in auto sales and sales at DIY stores like Home Depot. They also note that consumers are increasingly opting to spend more on experiences, technology and shop online.Earlier this year Sears said it would shutter 68 Kmart and 10 Sears stores across the country, with the bulk of them closing in late July, as it accelerates the closing of unprofitable stores and seeks to return to profitability.Adding to its restructuring efforts, Sears said on Thursday that it has hired Citigroup Global markets and LionTree Advisors to help it explore “alternatives” for its Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard brands as well as its Sears Home Services repair business.It said in a statement:Our iconic KCD brands are beloved by the American consumer and we believe that we can realize significant growth by further expanding the presence of these brands outside of Sears and Kmart,” the company said. The home-services business also “has greater potential than what we have delivered in the past.Shares in Sears have tumbled more than 39 per cent so far this year — worse than the 18 per cent drop in the S&P 500 department store sector.

Renaud Laplanche, its high-profile chief executive, quit earlier this month after the disclosure of internal reporting failures and other issues.The S&P 500 index shed 0.9 per cent to 2,047.2 at the close in New York, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 17,529.9. The Nasdaq Composite retreated 1.3 per cent at 4,715,7.A string of upbeat data on inflation and manufacturing were raising expectations that the Federal Reserve could be able to increase rates sooner than expected.Consumer prices rose by 0.4 per cent in April, the biggest gain since February, while US manufacturing rose for the first time in three months.“Shorter-term, it has the effect of people seeing a pullback for the credit markets or an increase in margin rates to buy stocks,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “Longer-term, it [a rate increase] should be a good thing for the stock market because it signals the economy is healthier.”After rebounding significantly from the brutal selling at the start of the year, US stocks have stalled in a range between about 2,050 and 2,090 on the S&P 500. Tuesday’s losses were also attributed to profit-taking on Monday’s rally.Shares of Home Depot fell 2.5 per cent to $132 in spite of offering a rare bit of bright news for earnings in the retail sector.The world’s largest do-it-yourself retailer reported first-quarter sales of $22.8bn, up 9 per cent year-on-year and slightly better than expected.It also raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance after what it described as a “stronger than expected” start to the year.Traders blamed the share price decline on hopes that the retailer would deliver even stronger figures, and the weak tone in the overall market.Still, discount retailer TJX rose 0.5 per cent to $75.59 after topping Wall Street expectations for its earnings.Last week, Macy’s, Kohl’s and Nordstrom disappointed investors with their earnings reports in what is shaping up as a challenging retail environment.Elsewhere, Pandora’s shares jumped 6.1 per cent to $10.59 on news that activist investor Corvex Management was pressing the internet radio company to explore a sale.The hedge fund run by Carl Icahn protégé Keith Meister is Pandora’s largest shareholder with a 9.9 per cent stake.Shares of Red Robin Gourmet Burgers slumped 18.2 per cent to $50.74 after the chain of speciality restaurants missed Wall Street expectations on first-quarter sales.
46;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Home Depot and TJX raise full-year profit guidance;Retailers buck trend of weaker earnings from US department stores;Home Depot and branded clothing retailer TJX raised their profit estimates for the full year thanks to a robust first quarter, bucking a trend of dismal department store earnings that were depressed by lacklustre product offerings.The world’s biggest home improvements company said it expected full-year sales to rise 6.3 per cent compared with a previous estimate of 5.1-6 per cent, while same-store-sales were forecast to rise 4.9 per cent compared with 3.7-4.5 per cent. It said earnings per share would increase more than initially forecast by 14.8 per cent to $6.27, instead of 12-13 per cent to $6.12-$6.18 a share.TJX, which sells branded clothes and other items at a discount, raised its guidance in light of a 7 per cent increase in comparable store sales and a 10 per cent increase in net sales to $7.5bn. It expected full-year EPS of between $3.35-$3.42 compared with earlier estimates of between $3.29-$3.38.US consumer spending has risen steadily during the economic recovery, but shoppers have become increasingly picky about what they buy as well as purchasing more online, forcing retailers to rethink their business models and improve their product line-ups. Consumers are also spending less on items such as apparel, opting instead for spending on experiences, or items that contribute to those experiences.Home Depot has benefited from an increase in residential sales transactions, which in turn boosts demand for home improvements. Its mobile apps, which guide its customers more effectively around its stores, and its move into the $52bn-a-year construction and maintenance industries has also helped boost profits. The shares reached an all-time high earlier this year but were down 1.5 per cent to $133.29 on Tuesday.Craig Menear, chairman and chief executive, said: “We’re playing in a $550bn market . . . and we own less than 20 per cent of that so we think there’s lots of opportunity to grow.”The company said it expected home prices to be up about 5 per cent this year, 3 per cent next year and 2 per cent the year after. It was also making changes to increase productivity, such as how it brought its product on to the store floor.For the first quarter, sales rose 9 per cent to $22.8bn with comparable store sales rising 6.5 per cent, the company said on Tuesday. This helped earnings jump 19 per cent to $1.44 a share.Shares of TJX, which has a market capitalisation of more than five times struggling department store Macy’s , rose 2 per cent to $76.72, as investors welcomed its earnings after profit warnings last week from the Cincinnati-based department store, and rivals such as Kohl’s.“Clearly the off-price channel continues to be among the chosen shopping destinations for consumers, and we believe TJX is well positioned to continue to gain share,” said Randal Konik, an analyst at Jefferies.

At its US stores, comparable sales were up 7.4 per cent.The result was slightly better than forecast; analysts had been expecting total first quarter sales of $22.4bn.The US retailer has raised its full year sales and earnings guidance following what it described as a “stronger than expected” start to the year.It is now expecting 2016 sales to rise 6.3 per cent and comparable sales to grow 4.9 per cent. The group had previously forecast gloomier sales growth of between 5.1 per cent to 6 per cent and comparable sales growth of between 3.7 per cent and 4.5 per cent, citing the effect of the strong dollar.Its diluted earnings per share guidance has also been lifted to around 14.8 per cent growth to $6.27 from a previous forecast of 12-13 per cent growth.Craig Menear, chief executive, said:We were pleased with our stronger than expected start to the year, driven by solid execution and broad-based growth across the store.This was made possible by our hard working associates and their continued dedication to our customers in a quarter marked by week-to-week demand spikes caused by weather variability.Recent disappointing results from a string of department stores, including JC Penney, Macy’s and Nordstrom, had raised concerns over US consumer sentiment but retail sales data published last week for the whole of the market was stronger than expected."

Its same-store sales in the three months to January 29 jumped 5.5 per cent, and Lowe’s struck a relatively bullish note for the 2016 as it forecast sales growth of 4 per cent.Robert Niblock, the chief executive of Lowe’s, acknowledged that a mild winter had helped as people spent on their gardens and the outside of their homes. That helped propel profits for the quarter to $541m, excluding the cost of existing an Australian joint venture, up 20 per cent from a year ago.It clocked sales of $13.2bn, better than last year’s $12.5bn, and stronger than the $13.1bn forecast by Wall Street analysts.Lowe’s shares climbed 1.7 per cent in pre-market trading.

Indeed, US stocks closed with substantial gains in three of the last six sessions.At the same time, US Treasury yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, have marched higher after a sharp decline earlier in the month. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose 5 basis points to 1.8 per cent on the day.US home improvement Home Depot helped cut the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s loss, rising 2.3 per cent in early trading after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly results.Investors were also waiting a reading on the housing market, which is expected to show sales of previously-owned US homes dipped 2.5 per cent on a month-to-month basis in January after a 14.7 per cent surge the month prior.

The housing market’s steady recovery in house prices, alongside that of the jobs market, is the key ammunition for those who argue the US economy will withstand the drags from slower global growth and a stronger dollar.Home Depot’s profits climbed to $1.5bn, or $1.17 a share, in the quarter to the end of January, from $1.4bn, or $1.05, a year ago. Wall Street analysts forecast earnings of $1.10 a share. At $21bn, revenue for the quarter beat expectations of $20.4bn and was almost 10 per cent higher than a year ago.Shares in Home Depot have fallen 7.1 per cent this year, lagging the 4.8 per cent decline in the wider S&P 500.

When they pile up in stockrooms or warehouses, the sting for retailers is both immediate and lingering. Third quarter retail earnings reports have been weak for several big US retailers— Macy’s, Nordstrom, Gap and Walmart, for example — sending their shares lower ahead of the holiday quarter. Macy’s partly blamed the strong dollar for pushing tourists away from New York. Nordstrom simply pleaded ignorance, saying they were merchants, not economists.Like the media companies who were caught flat-footed earlier this year as viewers migrated to digital television, retailers are having to get to grips with consumers who are staying away from their carefully planned stores. But as they try to come up with new business models, superfluous inventory adds to the headache of falling sales.Macy’s reported that its gross inventory balance was up 5 per cent, while sales dropped 5 per cent. Beyond tourists, it blamed unseasonably warm weather; coats did not sell quickly. To clear all that inventory, it is planning markdowns that will send its gross margin lower. Nordstrom believed it moved quickly to the markdown phase — its inventory growth was roughly in line with sales growth.Still, Credit Suisse estimates that among the seven large US department store chains, the gap between sales and inventory growth reached 600 basis points, the second-largest disconnect it had seen in a decade.Shoppers may not be in department stores or at other mall-based groups such as Gap (whose Banana Republic unit saw third-quarter sales drop 12 per cent), but they are still shopping. Shares in stylish discount chain TJX Companies have jumped by over 200 per cent in the past five years, inspiring Macy’s to introduce its own low-price brand, called Backstage.

Sales had climbed 6.4 per cent to $21.8bn. Adjusted earnings of $1.36 a share topped Wall Street forecasts by 4 cents.Home Depot has benefited from continuing momentum in the home construction market. Indeed, data released on Tuesday by the National Association of Home Builders showed homebuilder sentiment down slightly in November but still near the highest levels in a decade.
53;HD;Home Depot;2015-05-20T05:19:03Z;Fear of reputational damage after security leaks may be overhyped;It seems that customers have short memories when it comes to recalling online data breaches;"For the second time in just over a year, beauty products retailer Sally Beauty Holdings is investigating reports of fraud involving payment cards used by customers in its US stores.In a statement issued on May 4, the company said it was working with police and others to “gather facts, while working to ensure our customers are protected . . . Customer confidence and security remain our priority”.The company may find those customers are more forgiving than it expects. While reputational damage is often presented by technology suppliers as the consequence of security breaches, evidence suggests the public has a short memory, though senior executives will continue to pay the price for a bad leak.Last year’s hacking of Apple’s iCloud service, for example, in which intimate photos of celebrities were stolen and published online, has done little to dent its financial performance. However, while the Sony Pictures breach did not lead to a boycott by movie-goers, the company’s co-chair, Amy Pascal, stepped down after the scandal. Despite this, in its Q3 2014 financial statements, the company said it “doesn’t expect to suffer any long-term consequences” as a result of the attack.A survey of 4,235 US adults conducted by Software Advice, part of research company Gartner, found almost 80 per cent were not aware of the eBay breach, revealed in May 2014, which forced the online auction site to advise its 145m users to update their passwords.“Negative reputational impacts are totally exaggerated, in my opinion,” says Gartner analyst Avivah Litan. “I think customers forget about a breach very quickly and it doesn’t impact their interest in buying goods or services from the breached company.”She puts this down in part to “breach fatigue” caused by panicky headlines.Marc van Zadelhoff, vice-president of strategy in IBM’s security division, agrees: “The more frequently data breaches occur, the more desensitised people become, resulting in less of an impact to the brand’s reputation.”Etienne Greeff, chief executive of SecureData, a specialist security consultancy, says: “Reputational damage ranks low on the scale. It’s just not a big deal . . . It’s the regulatory fines and cost of remediation that influence corporate strategy.”Technological advances, rising global tensions and human failings are making it ever more vital to improve cyber security.Continue readingEven these costs may not amount to much, according to Benjamin Dean, a fellow at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. He analysed financial results from Sony, Home Depot and Target following well-publicised security breaches and concluded that the associated expenses reported by the companies amounted to less than 1 per cent of annual revenues.“After reimbursement from insurance and minus tax deductions, the losses are even less,” he wrote.Here, we take a look at the five of the largest-known data breaches to date and how they have affected companies.Heartland Payment Systems
Payment processing company Heartland announced it had fallen victim in 2008 to a security breach involving credit and debit card data. At the time, security experts said up to 100m cards, issued by more than 650 financial services companies, may have been compromised in what was described as the biggest criminal breach of card data. A US computer hacker, Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the crime. The breach cost the company $147.6m, but it claimed back $31.2m in insurance payouts.Four months after it disclosed the hack, Heartland was returned to Visa’s list of validated providers.Sony PlayStation Network
In April 2011, names, addresses, passwords and credit card data relating to 77m user accounts on Sony’s video game online network were compromised. The network shut down for several weeks and the company was later fined £250,000 by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office for what it called “a serious breach of the Data Protection Act”. In the US, the company spent $15m on settling lawsuits arising from the incident.Target
The hacking of IT systems at the US retailer resulted in the theft of the details of 40m payment cards and 70m other records, including customer email addresses and telephone numbers.Gregg Steinhafel, the chief executive, resigned in the aftermath. In its most recent financial statement, the company said costs relating to the breach totalled $252m, but added these were offset by an insurance payout that took the total down to $162m. And, according to Columbia University’s Mr Dean, once tax deductions are taken into account, the net losses tally $105m.Home Depot
The hacking of US retailer Home Depot resulted in the theft of more than 50m customer credit card numbers and emails. In the third quarter of 2014, the company said the breach had cost it $43m in pre-tax expenses, “partially offset by a $15m receivable for costs the company believes are reimbursable and probable of recovery under its insurance coverage, for pre-tax net expenses of $28m”. Mr Dean said that this “represents less than 0.01 per cent of Home Depot’s sales for 2014”.Anthem
The breach at this US health insurance company may have netted crooks medical data relating to 78.8m people.The incident continues to be analysed by the company and the government, but lawyers are already preparing class-action lawsuits.“I think Anthem did a relatively good job of disclosing its breach in terms of timeliness and owning up to it,” says Gartner’s Ms Litan. “They still got canned by the media, but if would have been much worse had they waited longer to disclose, as other breached companies do.”"

Economists on Wall Street expect inflation to rise 0.1 per cent in April from the previous month, with core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, projected to rise 0.2 per cent.UK parliamentThe UK parliament will convene on Monday for the first time since prime minister David Cameron’s Conservative party won a sweeping majority in the general election. The House of Commons is expected to elect a speaker and members of parliament will take an oath ahead of the formal start of the parliamentary year on May 27.Bank of Japan decisionThe Bank of Japan, which recently abandoned an informal timeframe to lift inflation to its 2 per cent target, will reveal its monetary policy decision on Friday followed by an expected press conference with governor Haruhiko Kuroda. The Japanese central bank is not expected to increase the size of its current stimulus measures.First-quarter gross domestic product figures are also set to be published in Japan, with economists forecasting that the economy expanded 0.4 per cent from the previous quarter.Central banks’ minutesA week after the Bank of England trimmed its growth outlook on the UK economy, the central bank will publish the minutes of its meeting in which it left benchmark interest rates unchanged at 0.5 per cent.The European Central Bank is also due to release minutes from its April meeting. Mario Draghi, the central bank’s president, has promised that the ECB will fully implement its €60bn-a-month asset purchasing programme, despite signs that inflation trends are improving.EarningsAs US earnings season winds down, 24 S&P 500 companies are slated to report earnings over the coming week. The list includes Home Depot, Walmart, TJX Cos, Etsy, Target, L Brands, Salesforce.com, Dollar Tree and Best Buy.The Week in four chartsTraders betting that the US dollar was on a one-way path to parity with the euro have been left licking their wounds.The euro continued a rally it began in the middle of April, touching a high of $1.147 to the greenback on Friday as investors and traders shifted out of the dollar. The common currency has now advanced more than 8 per cent since touching a low earlier this year.Much of the sell-off in the dollar was put down to a string of disappointing economic figures out of the world’s largest economy, fuelling expectations that the Federal Reserve will wait to lift its benchmark interest rates until September. A report showed retail sales flatlined in April, missing analyst expectations, while consumer confidence deteriorated at the start of May.Economic data out of China also proved lacklustre, with both industrial output and retail sales falling short of economist expectations, underlying the difficulty policy makers have had at spurring activity. The figures added to disappointing trade and inflation numbers out earlier this month that point to a weak start to the second quarter.Shares in door-to-door cosmetics company Avon Products surged and then fell back after an $8.2bn buyout offer made through an SEC filing proved to be a hoax.

But the view from the streets is rather less gung ho, with restaurants as likely to be stuffed with thrifty grannies as the upwardly mobile middle-class patrons referred to by Mr Loeb.For the past quarter of a century, KFC was the gold standard for foreign brands among Chinese. But now its restaurants, especially in big cities, play host to grannies entertaining an only grandchild or elderly matchmakers running impromptu dating agencies alongside the more lucrative customers.“I am tempted to say KFC’s best days in China are probably behind them. They are dealing with a lot of tough trends,” says James Roy, consumer analyst at China Market Research in Shanghai.These challenges include rising labour costs and rents, labour shortages, changing consumer tastes and increasing competition. This suggests that Yum faces more structural problems than simply a blip caused by the recent food safety scandals.“Yum China has recovered from previous downturns in its business. However, each time the recovery has taken longer and requires more marketing expenditure,” says Li Junheng of JL Warren Capital.“Yum’s challenges in China are mostly structural, rather than one-off. These structural issues are unlikely to disappear with financial engineering that focuses on expanding the stock multiple and ignores fundamentals.”KFC faces growing competition from more innovative start-up fast-dining concepts.“China is evolving away from that type of restaurant. They need to do something to remain relevant — and they aren’t doing it as well as, for example, McDonald’s,” says Mr Roy.They need to do something to remain relevant — and they aren’t doing it as well as, for example, McDonald’sYum recently reported a 12 per cent annual same-store sales decline in the first quarter and weaker margins. But Greg Creed, its chief executive, predicted a better second half to the year.KFC’s decline comes at a time when foreign retail brands are struggling in China not just in the fast food sector, but in many areas including supermarkets, electronics and home improvement retailing. Big international brands such as US retailers Best Buy and Home Depot have been forced to abandon China in recent years.But Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein, who attended the conference, sees a brighter future for Yum in China. “They appear to be recovering from the supply chain scandals.“While they acknowledge the market has become more competitive . . . because of the advantages they have always had here, scale, brand recognition and supply chain, there is every reason to believe they can retain their market share leadership,” she says.Torsten Stocker, greater China retail partner at A.T. Kearney, the professional services firm, says it is too soon to predict the demise of one of the mainland’s most famous brands. “It is natural that a ‘market creator’ like Yum will have to work extra-hard to stay ahead of the competitors that it often spawns itself,” he says.Additional reporting by Jackie Cai
56;HD;Home Depot;2015-04-19T15:18:19Z;Cyber security funding tops $1bn after high-profile attacks;Amount raised by sector doubles year-on-year after hacker breaches at Sony Pictures and Home Depot;Cyber security start-ups raised more than $1bn for the first time in a single quarter as investors bet on them benefiting after several high profile attacks by hackers on large companies.Venture capital firms including Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins, as well as VC arms of banks and technology companies, are pouring money into the sector as they anticipate rapid growth in cyber security budgets.Demand for these services are expected to soar after high levels of publicity for recent attacks on big companies from Sony Pictures to Home Depot.Funding for cyber security companies hit $1.02bn in the first quarter, up from $540m for the first three months of last year and almost double the same period of 2014, according to data from private company research firm PrivCo.This came on top of an already buoyant 2014, in which security start-ups hit $2.3bn in funding, up more than a third from the year before. Four years ago, total annual funding was less than $1bn.Sam Hamadeh, chief executive of PrivCo, said the record levels of funding were spurred by ramped up corporate spending and predictions that smartphone security was becoming a serious problem for companies whose employees deal in sensitive data from their mobiles.“Within cyber security, venture capitalists were most interested in mobile security, which was the most active subsector of the quarter for new venture fundings,” he said. “Cyber attacks against enterprises have spread from the server and the desktop to the worrisome soft target of mobile phones, where not only files but stored passwords, emails, text messages, even actual phone calls could be spied upon with malware.”When cyber security start-ups set out their stalls at the industry‘s largest annual conference on Monday, they will be looking to show off their hacker-fighting prowess not just to buyers of security products, but also to Wall Street investors.Continue readingVenture capitalists will be out in force looking for new investments at the RSA conference this week in San Francisco, the largest cyber security conference in the world. Many are predicting a boom in cyber security M&A, as larger companies who have struggled to develop the most innovative protections themselves, acquire start-ups for their technology and their talent.Some of the larger cyber security start-ups such as Rapid7 and Veracode are prime candidates for initial public offerings, according to analysts and venture capitalists.Since the quarter ended, Illumio, a start-up focused on securing data centres, has raised more than $100m in a round led by Blackrock, the world’s largest fund manager.Other large funding rounds this year include those of Tanium, which has developed a software enabling IT managers to roll out updates in seconds. It raised $52m to make it one of Andreessen Horowitz’s largest ever investments after a $90m investment from the same firm last year.
57;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Wolseley: American dream;The builders’ merchant’s US business is doing well, but Europe is struggling;You have done your research. You have checked out the US GDP data and the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index (14 per cent higher than it was a year ago). You have delved into the National Association of Home Builders’ remodelling market index, which is also telling a bullish tale. So you have concluded that the US building supplies market is the place to be. The obvious choices are Home Depot and Lowe’s. But shares in both are up by more than 130 per cent over the past three years, and they trade at 22 times forecast earnings. Rarely has the business of selling lumber and masonry been so admired.So how about UK-based Wolseley? A snip at 18 times earnings, and it makes three-quarters of its profits in the US. Tuesday’s first-half numbers showed that those bullish economic indicators are finding their way into revenues and profits. The former rose 15 per cent in the US, while the latter rose 23 per cent. Wolseley’s US operating margin sits at a record 7.9 per cent.The problem is that you would also have exposure to the other quarter of profits, which mostly come from Europe. Like-for-like sales are inching ahead in the region, but profits are falling. In the UK — which accounts for 15 per cent of revenues and is, in theory, in a stronger economic condition than the continent — profits fell by a tenth due partly to a weak market for heating. Elsewhere, problems in the Nordic market pushed Wolseley into making a £245m goodwill writedown on a 2006 acquisition. That forced the group as a whole into a net loss for the period. Wolseley’s European operation is proving to be a small, but heavy, item — like a brick.So to buy into Wolseley is to assume that Home Depot and Lowe’s cannot go much further, and that the European business will eventually perk up and allow the rating to rise towards 20. Both are possible. But the economic data that would justify that decision look far from certain.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
58;HD;Home Depot;2015-03-10T09:23:29Z;Buybacks sustain US bull run;Apple alone bought $45bn of its own stock last year;The fatigued US bull-run has one piston that continues to fire.S&P 500 companies spent more than $900bn on share buybacks and dividends over the past 12 months, more than twice the level recorded five years ago as the US began to emerge from the financial crisis, and a key driver in the stock market’s ageing six-year rally.The consistent buying by US corporates, often prompted by shareholder activism, has supported the stock market rally into 2015, offsetting wide selling by investors who see more opportunity in European equities. Investors have pulled roughly $28.5bn from mutual funds and exchange traded funds invested in the S&P 500 since the year began, data from fund tracker Lipper shows.Flush with cash, US multinationals spent $553.2bn on buybacks and $350.4bn on dividends in 2014, choosing shareholder returns over investment in research and development and capital expenditures given the bumpy global economic backdrop, according to preliminary data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.“Cash in the fourth quarter set another all-time record in the index,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices. “It’s what they chose to do. In this case [companies] are being pushed by outside people to give back more. It does not mean they are being generous at all.”The practice, while appeasing shareholders, has been cause for criticism as analysts wait for a meaningful rise in sales — the missing link in the current recovery. S&P 500 corporates are not expected to move the needle this year, with bottom-up consensus forecasts projecting a meagre increase in revenues, largely the result of a slump in oil prices.Investors expect cash to continue to funnel to buybacks and dividends. Despite the record levels of returns, dividend payouts stood at 38 per cent of earnings last year — below historic levels, Mr Silverblatt noted.Orrin Sharp-Pierson, a strategist at BNP Paribas, added that buybacks have been “very important” to the S&P 500’s gains and that slower earnings growth “will generally not impact the flow”.He added: “The ‘stock effect’ is that companies have bought back around 20 per cent of market capitalisation since Lehman’s collapse, or around $3.8tn using today’s equity prices.“Compare that to the $4.5tn Fed balance sheet or a very similar expansion of $3.5tn.”Apple has become the exemplar for share buybacks, purchasing $45bn-worth of its stock last year, more than the combined value of shares bought by ExxonMobil, Intel, IBM and Wells Fargo, the SPDJI data show. Analysts on Wall Street expect the iPhone maker to increase its programme this April, with those at Credit Suisse forecasting $165bn-worth of buybacks to be completed over the next two and a half years.The Cupertino-based group is not alone, as companies increase buyback schemes to negate expiring employee options. On Monday, Qualcomm lifted its buyback authorisation to $15bn and the management team said they intended to complete two-thirds of the purchases within the next 12 months. Home Depot, Gilead Sciences and PepsiCo have also authorised $10bn plus buybacks since the year began.Two-thirds of companies in the S&P 500 have reduced their share count in the past year, including more than a fifth who have done so by more than 4 per cent. Those reductions signal capital discipline, investors say, particularly amid the frenetic pace of dealmaking at the start of the year.“Once you use cash to buy back stock, it can’t be used to overpay for an acquisition or invest in an underperforming division,” Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, said. “That’s a constructive message to shareholders in what remains a very sluggish global growth environment.”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
59;HD;Home Depot;2015-02-25T18:19:50Z;Home Depot/Lowe’s: Humble pie;DIY retailers have outpaced the US housing market;Humility is a rare but welcome attribute in companies, especially in those that are on top of their game. But it can also be worrying. Home Depot on Tuesday reported a strong fourth quarter — same store sales were up 8 per cent. Rival Lowe’s on Wednesday similarly beat expectations. Shares in the two companies are each up at least 70 per cent in the past two years. Yet as Craig Menear, Home Depot’s chief executive, admitted, the underlying economic and housing indicators do not fully explain the retailer’s strength.Mr Manear wondered aloud about the link between house price growth and home retailer revenue. US house prices rose 4 per cent in 2014, after 13 per cent growth in the previous year. He cited a study from a decade ago that concluded there was a lag of several months between house price growth and the impact on home-improvement spending. He also suggested that Home Depot’s resilience could be down to changes in the housing stock. Nearly 4m single family homes became rental stock between 2006 and 2013. They are slowly moving back to being owner-occupied and require significant remodelling. However, Home Depot’s modesty had its limits. The company also pointed out its own prescience in expanding towards categories such as appliances and cleaning supplies, which helped to boost traffic.Still, the chasm between a steady US economic expansion and the weak housing market remains concerning. Mortgage rates remain historically low, around 4 per cent, but banks are stingy when it comes to extending loans. Last year sales of existing US homes, nearly 90 per cent of the market, fell slightly from 2013 to just under 5m. US annual housing starts of 1m are still stuck at half their level than before the financial crisis. None of this should be good news for Home Depot and Lowes.But both companies trade at 23 times forward earnings, a third higher than their trough multiples of the past two years. So caution should abound, however humble the company is.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

The strong results followed a cyber security breach last year in which hackers stole 53m email addresses and 56m payment card details.“The 7.9 per cent comp indicates that the breach had a minimal effect on the company’s business during the quarter,” Alan Rifkin, an analyst at Barclays, said. “We continue to believe Home Depot remains most attractively positioned to benefit from the relatively improved housing market.”Home Depot reported profits of $1.4bn or $1.05 a share, in the three months to February, compared with profits of $1bn or 73 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Sales climbed 8 per cent to $19.2bn.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 89 cents a share on sales of $18.7bn.Home Depot’s 2015 earnings guidance in the range of $5.11-$5.17 a share was lower than Wall Street forecasts for $5.23 a share.“Initial guidance from Home Depot is typically conservative,” Brian Nagel, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said. “We view the fiscal year 2015 figures that management outlined today as conducive to steady upside over the next several quarters.”The company also reported a 26 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend to 59 cents a share and authorised an $18bn share buyback programme.Home Depot shares, which have advanced 50 per cent in the past year, gained 4 per cent to $116.75.Shares of luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers climbed 4 per cent to $38.53, after the company reported financial first-quarter earnings and sales that topped Wall Street estimates.Toll Brothers reported profits of $81.3m or 44 cents a share, on sales of $853.5m. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 28 cents a share, on sales of $777.8m.Toll Brothers said it delivered 1,091 homes in the three months to the end of January, up 18 per cent from a year ago. It also said the average price of homes climbed 13 per cent to $782,300.Macy’s shares fell 3 per cent to $62.10, after the retailer issued 2015 guidance that disappointed markets. Macy’s expects earnings in the range of $4.70-$4.80 a share, shy of Wall Street forecasts for $4.84 a share.Macy’s reported a fourth-quarter decline in profits to $793m, though profits topped forecasts, while sales climbed 1.8 per cent to $9.36bn, just shy of estimates.“While we believe Macy’s is the winner in the mid-tier department store space, margin growth is slowing and sales growth is also decelerating,” Paul Lejuez, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said. “Without structural changes in the sector, we believe it will be tough for Macy’s to continue to boost sales, making profit growth difficult to achieve, and making it tougher for the stock to outperform.”US stocks fluctuated at record levels after Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered her testimony to the Senate Banking Committee.The S&P 500 gained 0.3 per cent to 2,115.48, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.5 per cent to 18,209.19.

61;HD;Home Depot;2015-02-05T04:12:29Z;US health group Anthem hit by hackers;Targeted database held details of about 80m people;Anthem, the second-biggest US health insurance company, late on Wednesday revealed that it was the victim of what is thought to be the biggest cyberattack to hit the sector, with as many as 80m of its customers potentially exposed.The company said that the records of an unknown number of its present and former customers had been taken, including their social security numbers and salary details.The company database that was the target of what Anthem called a “very sophisticated external cyberattack” held details of about 80m people in all, around half of them current customers.In a message to the insurer’s members, Joseph Swedish, chief executive, said that the company had “no evidence” at this stage that credit card or medical information was stolen along with other records, although the breach is still under investigation.The large size of the database that was targeted in the attack stands to make the Anthem breach one of the largest to hit a US financial institution, potentially ranking alongside the 76m customer records that were taken when JPMorgan was hacked last year.However, the extent of the personal information in the Anthem case is much greater, encompassing not only extensive employment and social security records but a range of personal information including medical IDs and email and street addresses.The breach was discovered by the company itself, making it one of the relatively rare cases where a large-scale hack was identified by internal means rather than being reported by third parties, according to an official at Mandiant, a cyber security company called in after the problem was discovered.The first signs of extensive data breaches usually come when information from the stolen records starts to appear on other sites, as happened with credit card details taken from retailers like Target and Home Depot.Anthem said it had contacted the FBI about the attack and “immediately made every effort to close the security vulnerability”. However, in a sign that it had yet to get to the bottom of the full extent of the problems, Mr Swedish said the company was “working around the clock to do everything we can to further secure your data”.
62;HD;Home Depot;2015-01-16T18:53:04Z;Can investors judge chief executives’ performance?;How to assess company leadership;When Serco announced the appointment of Rupert Soames as chief executive last February, shares in the outsourcer rose by more than 10 per cent on the day. The stock of Aggreko, the power rental group Mr Soames had led for more than a decade, initially fell 7 per cent.Clearly, investors expected Mr Soames would bring some of the leadership qualities of his grandfather, Winston Churchill, to bear on Serco’s problems. The performance of the share price since — down two-thirds since the day the change was announced — suggests their judgment was at best premature.Yet shifts in the price of companies that switch chief executive are still taken by many to be the best assessment of how good or bad the incumbents and their replacements are at their jobs. It is also a sign of how hard it is for ordinary investors to gauge the quality of individual executives.Does this mean there is no link between good management and investment returns? Not at all. Plenty of academics, analysts and consultants have tried to assess the correlation between fine stewardship and strong performance and found clear ties. The problem is that many of the signals that the experts try to spot are concealed from the outsider, apply only to a subset of companies, or reflect the historic success of individuals — sometimes inflated by external factors — rather than their future prospects.Even professional fund managers, who have much greater access than retail shareholders both to the data and, more important, to the executives themselves, say judging managers is “more art than science”.First, the science. Morten Hansen, a professor at University of California Berkeley and Insead, worked with Insead’s Herminia Ibarra and Urs Peyer, on a ranking of the world’s best-performing chief executives for Harvard Business Review, focusing on those with a relatively long tenure. The HBR ranking, the latest version of which appeared last November, uses growth in total shareholder return and market capitalisation as proxies for good management. Jeff Bezos of Amazon topped the November list, with Simon Wolfson of Next the leading UK chief executive, at number 43. Other UK big-hitters are shown in the graphic.But the publication itself conceded that “leading a company and creating value depend on many skills that are hard to measure — strategic vision, authenticity, long-term planning”. Prof Hansen himself says there is little dispute that good management, however it is defined, leads to better results, but adds: “The question we don’t know [the answer to] is, how much does it explain?” As for chief executives, they “do have some impact on company performance, but is that separate from, or because of, a good management team? We don’t know”.London School of Economics and McKinsey, the consultancy, together with professors from Stanford and Harvard have identified in their World Management Survey a set of management practices that led to increased productivity. They include the use of known techniques such as “lean manufacturing”, the way companies use targets to measure performance, and how they manage their people, from recruitment to rewards.McKinsey’s John Dowdy, who has seen the project grow from an initial sample of 18 UK manufacturers to 10,000 manufacturing companies worldwide, says researchers find “a powerful correlation between management practice and productivity”. An LSE team even applied the technique on the ground in India and found that poorly run textile companies that took their free management advice were able to improve their performance against a control group.But it would be hard for investors to adapt the LSE-McKinsey approach for large publicly listed companies in all sectors. The study’s most compelling insights come from medium-sized manufacturers, many of them privately owned. When executives were asked, it also turned out they were themselves unaware of the impact of what they were doing. “Individuals’ understanding and knowledge of how well run their own company is, is non-existent: it’s not just poor, it’s statistically insignificant,” says Mr Dowdy. “Not only might an outsider have difficulty telling what the management practice of a company is, the insiders might have a hard time.”The odds, then, seem stacked against outside investors, who instead of spending time analysing managers’ skills may prefer to follow Warren Buffett’s advice “to buy stock in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them. Because sooner or later, one will”.Yet there are occasions when a determined chief executive can make a difference (even the Sage of Omaha, when buying companies for Berkshire Hathaway, sets great store by the quality of managers, whom he then leaves to “focus on running their businesses”).What do corporate chiefs expect in 2015? FT journalists gather predictions, hopes and fears from the UK and elsewhere. Continue readingSimon Gergel, chief investment officer for UK equities at Allianz Global Investors, says that when a company is in trouble, a strong chief executive may be just what is needed. Compass’s Richard Cousins, 65th on the HBR ranking, is an example of a turnround maestro: his firm executive style helped the catering company recover after he took over in 2006.But context matters in assessing managers, Mr Gergel says, and investors should beware of people with a good reputation who overstay their welcome. “For the first 10 years, [Sir] Terry Leahy did a very good job at Tesco, but he got overconfident and wasn’t sufficiently challenged,” he points out.Tesco is now suffering the backlash. But since Sir Terry’s successor Philip Clarke left last year, the retailer has bet twice over on strong managers to repair its performance. It hired as chief executive the respected Unilever manager Dave Lewis, who earlier this month recruited Halfords’ boss Matt Davies to head its troubled UK retail operations.Prior record is not, unfortunately, always a guide to executives’ future performance.In the US, for instance, Bob Nardelli, one of the two unsuccessful candidates to succeed Jack Welch as chief executive of General Electric in 2001, had the pick of top jobs at other companies on leaving GE. But he was deemed a failure at the helm of Home Depot, the do-it-yourself store he chose to lead. Jeffrey Immelt, who beat Mr Nardelli to become Mr Welch’s successor, has experienced lacklustre returns at GE, notwithstanding the company’s enduring reputation as one of the best managed businesses in the world.Low expectations can also be confounded: some doubted whether Carolyn McCall’s skills running Guardian Media Group would translate to the new context of civil aviation, yet she has made a great success of leading easyJet.Mr Gergel of Allianz says individual investors now have more ways of judging individual managers and management systems. The corporate governance structure, which can provide a vital check on overambitious executives, and the incentive system are more transparent than ever. Even if they do not attend annual meetings, investors can watch chief executives present the results, and scrutinise the detail online. Mr Gergel concedes, however, that one important measure he uses to assess new executives — how well they allocate capital — is harder for an investor to analyse.Jeremy Whitley, head of UK and European equities at Aberdeen Asset Management, sums up the commonsense approach to investing in individual managers this way: “It’s a case of not lending too much credence and making sure that they don’t do anything daft.”Investors are speculating on potential successors to Dalton Philips who was ousted on Monday as chief executive of Wm Morrison after five years in charge amid poor Christmas salesContinue readingHe suggests there may be fewer risks investing in family-controlled businesses, where the interests of the main shareholder should be better aligned with the long-term interests of minority shareholders. George Weston of Associated British Foods ranks 75th in the HBR list of best-performing chief executives. As grandson of the founder, he may be the exception to the rule, also demonstrated by academic studies, that families should generally hand over the running of companies to professional managers or risk the possibility that later generations will squander early success.Managers’ influence on their company may also depend on the sector in which they operate or the competitive situation. As recent chief executive departures from UK mining companies suggest, executive reputations can be inflated during market bubbles. John Dowdy points out that in industries such as telecoms, where the network effect is at work, strong operational management will not help a company with a tiny share succeed if its sloppily run rival has two-thirds of the market: “Even if I have the slickest operation in the world, you’re still going to crush me.”Investors who insist on following the reputation of individual managers may be better advised to look at small- and medium-sized companies, where the chain of command is shorter and the impact senior leaders can have on productivity is more direct.At larger companies, though, investors still risk placing too much emphasis on the ability of individuals rather than the overall strength of the management structure and culture — another intangible that is notoriously hard to measure.As Manuel Hensmans, Gerry Johnson and George Yip write in their book Strategic Transformation, an analysis of Tesco and other UK companies’ long run of success, large organisations thrive and survive by encouraging a culture of challenge to incumbent leaders. But “no one individual, however exceptional his or her leadership, can single-handedly assure the future, especially of large, complex organisations”.Ten warning signs that managers or management may be going wrong:● No internal challenge or dissent● Inability to understand budgeting and capital allocation● Plans for a grandiose new headquarters● A “transformational” acquisition based on little or no deal experience● Unexpected changes in the chief executive’s incentives● A servile chair and board of directors● Inconsistency between the chief executive’s message and the company’s results● Lack of obvious successors● Overcentralised planning● Oversensitivity to criticism from analysts or media.Tesco’s decision to pick an outsider to run the company after Phil Clarke resigned last year was itself a sign of the depth of problems at the retailer, which had, until then, always selected internal candidates as chief executive. But it could be the right move, based on some studies that show executives appointed from outside outperform internal appointments at companies facing significant challenges.Sometimes an external hire is needed to consolidate changes, as happened when Paul Polman (an outsider) took over as chief executive of Unilever in 2009, succeeding the cost-cutting insider Patrick Cescau.When companies are running well, however, an inside hire — which remains the norm — may be preferable. Simon Gergel of Allianz Gobal Investors says that “arguably, you should wait two or three years after someone has left to work out whether they are a good manager”, based on how sustainable the group’s performance is and how well they picked their successor.James Pickford and guests discuss the importance of company management for investors, tips for taxpayers ahead of the self-assessment deadline, and proposals that would allow annuity holders to sell their productsListen nowMorten Hansen and colleagues caution that whether or not an outsider has a better chance turning round a challenged company may depend on where the company is based. Their research suggests outsiders who take over at European companies in crisis do better than insiders, whereas in the US, outsiders perform no better than executives promoted internally to tackle problems.John Dowdy of McKinsey, however, believes an outside perspective often helps companies stay alert. Internal movement between roles, as practised by big multinationals such as General Electric, PepsiCo and McKinsey itself, is also a good sign, he suggests: “If you have a fresh set of eyes, some say you’re going to drive a fresh set of improvements.”Andrew Hill is the FT’s management editor
63;HD;Home Depot;2015-01-16T17:24:55Z;US retailers stumble in Canada;Clutch of premium brands build up their cross-border presence as household names retreat;Less than two years after Target opened its first stores in Canada, the US retailer has found that its efforts north of the border missed the mark.The company’s expansion campaign was plagued with problems from the start. Canadian consumers hoping for a taste of the affordable fashion and discount chain closer to home were met with empty shelves, lacklustre merchandise and higher than expected prices. The venture resulted in nearly $2bn in operating losses for Target, and now an embarrassing retreat.“We were losing money every day,” chief executive Brian Cornell admitted.There have been several success stories over the past few decades by US mass-market contenders moving north of the border, such as Home Depot, Costco, L Brands and Walmart. But Target is not alone in hitting problems in Canada, a country of 35m people with a $400bn retail trade.In October, Sears announced it would sell a majority of its stake in its struggling Canadian unit to raise as much as $380m to offset its losses, while other household names such as Best Buy have cut back their cross-border presence in recent years after failing to gain traction.Nordstrom, the premium US department chain that opened its first store in Calgary in September, delayed its plans to open 20 of its Rack outlets in Canada “given everything on our plate in both the US and Canada and the complexity of it”.And yet they keep coming — with the latest American entrants hailing from the upper end of the retail spectrum.Canada’s appeal appears to be its relatively robust economy and steadily affluent consumer base. Now, a clutch of premium US retailers are racing to build up in the country.Fashion brands Michael Kors and Calvin Klein have both said they want to expand in Canada, while Canadian retailer Hudson’s Bay acquired Saks Fifth Avenue for $2.9bn last July with the aim of launching the upscale US department chain on home turf. It plans to open seven full-line stores and 25 Saks Off Fifth stores, beginning in the autumn.Lucky Brand, the denim retailer, has opened 11 locations in Canada, recording 18 per cent same-store sales growth in 2014 — outperforming all its other markets.Industry observers say that the Canadian retail market — at just a tenth of the size of that of the US — is still under-penetrated. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, a well-regulated banking sector and resilient job market have triggered a swifter economic recovery than in the US — and a wealth of underserved shoppers with potentially deeper pockets.“Canadian consumers are feeling better about discretionary spending than many counterparts elsewhere and, as a result, the accessible luxury price-point is a real sweet spot for US retailers,” says Jeff Schiamberg, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets.“In terms of department stores there is Sears at the lowest-end, and the mid-market placed Hudson’s Bay, but currently no major operators carving out a niche at the highest end of the sector,” he says.With just 150 malls across the country and little development in the pipeline, real estate has become a critical part of the puzzle.“We’ve wanted to be in Canada for years — but the challenge was finding the right locations for our stores,” Karen McKibbin, president of Nordstrom Canada, told the FT last year.“There is a highly educated fashion customer being served by a robust retail community. Still, we feel there is an opportunity in Canada to provide customers with more options for where to shop and we think we can do a lot of business.”But Nordstrom — and its peers — will be keen to avoid the pitfalls encountered by Target and other US retailers. For the time being, they are remaining upbeat, if cautious.“We are very happy with our business in Calgary but recognise we have a lot to learn as we open more stores in Canada,” says Nordstrom spokesperson John Bailey upon news that Target was abandoning the country.Carlos Alberini, chief executive of Lucky Brand, says the company’s biggest hurdle has been gaining brand recognition without a large store presence — a point Target hoped would work in its favour with its aggressive launch.“Canada is a big market and achieving high brand awareness without a large store presence, significant marketing spend and many years in the market is very challenging,” he says.Historically, Canadian consumers have been keen to embrace American brands, with thousands regularly crossing the border to their southern neighbour on shopping trips. However, as Target found out, they were more than willing to place pricing and product mixes over convenience.“These new entrants have to be savvy and remember there are important cultural differences to be considered — especially in Quebec or areas where there will be less awareness of particular US labels,” says RBC’s Mr Schiamberg.The major homegrown competition — upmarket chains Holt Renfrew and Harry Rosen — are preparing for their rivals. Harry Rosen announced a $100m expansion and store upgrade when it found out Nordstrom and Saks were coming to Canada. Three major stores are set to open in 2015.“It’s a marketplace with enormous spending power and potential, but is unforgiving to those unwilling to adopt to its nuances,” Mr Schiamberg says.

Retailers have kicked off the holiday shopping season earlier than ever this year, moving the battle for Middle America’s dollars online in the run up to Black Friday, the biggest US shopping event of the year.Traditionally, queues have formed in parking lots and checkout aisles before midnight on Thanksgiving Day, with bargain-hungry customers squabbling outside stores for first dibs on promotional deals. That frenzy used to mark the start of the holiday shopping season.Now that has changed. As more people than ever shop online, and amid bitter competition from rivals, many leading retailers are starting their offers earlier and online in an effort to lure customers. Some are selling discounted items at a loss.“It used to be called Black Friday, then it became Thursday, now it’s a week long,” noted Duncan Mac Naughton, US chief merchant at Walmart. “Maybe we should just call it November.”Black Friday is a newer and smaller phenomenon in the UK, but the pace has also quickened for retailers there.Asda, the UK arm of Walmart, said there would be three times as many special offers than last year, but did not put a figure on its financial commitment to the event this Friday. “It will be the biggest Black Friday in the UK ever. It will certainly be the biggest we have ever done,” said Andrew Moore, head of Asda’s general merchandise business.In the US, Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer by sales, Target and Home Depot all unveiled their first digital-only holiday deals in the first week of November. BDO, the accountancy firm, reckons more than a third of retailers will already have offered most of their holiday promotions by the time consumers sit down to Thanksgiving dinner.It will be the biggest Black Friday in the UK ever. It will certainly be the biggest we have ever done“By 2020, the official start to the holiday season may be in October,” says Ted Vaughan, US partner in BDO’s retail and consumer practice.“Consumers expect holiday promotions to come early and end late, and it’s becoming increasingly challenging for retailers to provide attractive deals while preserving margins.”Digital contenders are also changing the stakes. Amazon, the most-visited online retailer in the US on Black Friday last year, started rolling out “lightning” sales every 10 minutes.As retail sales in the UK continue to show growth, the FT keeps up with all the latest news and reports

Further readingMeanwhile, mobile devices are set to play a big role this season. A study by Criteo, a market research group, predicted 27 per cent of purchases would come from smartphones.The National Retail Federation, the largest US industry retail group, estimates that November and December sales will increase 4.1 per cent to $617bn – the highest level in three years.According to Mintel, the research company, this year’s Black Friday could generate up to £200m of UK sales – double 2013’s figure.But some say Black Friday may not be good for British retailers as it typically pulls sales forward from Christmas. “Retailers are either taking market share away from each other, or moving purchases around in terms of time,” says Bryan Roberts, a director of Kantar Retail."

Its system had been overwhelmed by the number of orders, which delayed opening trades and caused investors to lose hundreds of millions of dollars.But smaller market events have roiled markets. In 2012 trading firm Knight Capital said it lost $440m in 30 minutes because of software glitches, which also sparked chaos in the markets.The regulation, known as Regulation SCI, came a day after Home Depot became the latest flash crash victim in the US equity market. On Tuesday the New York Stock Exchange cancelled trades in the company’s shares after the stock fell sharply, briefly wiping more than $12bn off its value.The final decision by the SEC came after a delayed vote in October following criticism from Democrat commissioners that the rules did not go far enough to control markets – in particular for failing to include brokers that deal with retail investors.While the rules passed unanimously, with support from both Republican and Democrat commissioners, Ms White said the SEC would now consider whether similar regulation should apply to broker-dealers and others.Wall Street participants, including the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, have fought against expanding the proposal to include brokers, arguing that this would increase costs for investors.The rules will be enforceable by the authorities and replace a voluntary compliance system. They are set to apply to stock exchanges, trading venues for options, certain dark pools, registered clearing agencies and other “significant” alternative trading systems.
66;HD;Home Depot;2014-11-12T00:12:50Z;Opinion: Hackers cost retailers dear;Your company has probably been hacked;Companies may not know it, but it is highly likely they have already been hacked. Hardly a day goes by without a security breach being reported by a retailer. As of early November, the Identity Theft Resource Center in the US had confirmed of 644 breaches for the year to date, a 25.3 per cent increase over the same time period last year (514 breaches).Yet most organisations still fail to recognise the reality of their situation, best described in a speech by Robert Mueller, who retired as director of the US’s Federal Bureau of Investigation in September. As Mr Mueller said: “There are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those that will be.”The stark reality is organisations need to wake up and recognise that, no matter how much time, effort and resources they put into defending their infrastructure, the bad guys will always find a way in. Attacks may occur through holes in core software that have not been patched by vendors because they are not yet aware of the defects, or by malicious insiders who make use of and abuse their privileged status. Failure by employees to follow corporate best security practices may also have led to a breach.Businesses need to recognise there is no such thing as perfect security and stop looking for an ideal solution. They should, instead, focus on adopting a risk management approach to protect their business assets. For example, retailers have video surveillance cameras, loss prevention officers, and theft insurance to deter crooks and mitigate against criminal losses. In other words, they already accept the fact that criminals will steal from them, and so they put systems in place to help limit the damage. An organisation’s attitude to cyber security should be no different.With cyber crime, however, the scale of the losses can be staggeringly different. A case in point is Sony, which in May 2011 publicly reported that cyber attacks cost it $171m. The company also recently offered to pay an additional $15m to settle a class-action lawsuit.Other high-profile examples of data breaches from the retail world, include Target Stores, a US retailer that reported up to 70m customers had been affected following a cyber hack last December, and Home Depot, which is reported to have had the accounts of 56m credit card holders compromised in an attack discovered in September.However, what is perhaps most frightening, from an international perspective, is that state actors are increasingly recognising the value that can be taken from cyber space. For instance, for countries that have significant manufacturing and industrial economies, but have made little headway in terms of innovation, stealing the design documents for a patented process can save hundreds of million of research and development dollars.This helps keep thousands of citizens employed and means products for export can be produced at a fraction of the usual price. These costs are borne by victim companies and countries. A prime example of this is the theft of a paint manufacturing process from DuPont, the US chemical company, by an insider working in collusion with companies controlled by the Government of the People’s Republic of China.It is not only nation states or big brands that are targeted. Small companies can also become victims. Although many SMEs may feel they are unlikely targets because of their small customer base, relatively low revenue or the niche services they provide, they are just as likely to be the stalked by cyber criminals. It is very hard to predict an attack and there is no telling where the next one will come from, what will trigger it or who the victim will be.To mitigate the risks of such an event, companies must acknowledge it is more than likely their security will be breached, then allocate funding based on the potential damage that is likely to caused by an attack.They also need to make their organisations as unappealing a target as possible, reducing the criminals’ return on their investment by raising the costs of an attack with strong encryption, distributed data sources, and by compartmentalising customer data. This approach is the same as in the physical world, where alarms, locks, cameras and guards persuade criminals to look for easier targets.Crucially, they should ensure there are measures and systems in place to detect a breach swiftly.Responses to a breach should be rehearsed in advance. Have your public statements for customers, employees, regulators and the press prepared, appropriate website messages ready, and alternative payment methods in place to reduce losses.Finally, make sure you test your emergency procedures. A speedy recognition of – and a quick response to – a breach will help to lessen the damage.The writer is senior vice-president and fellow at IT security company Neustar, and in 2013 he received the FBI Director’s Award for outstanding cyber investigation for his part in uncovering and dismantling the “butterfly” botnet
67;HD;Home Depot;2014-11-09T19:37:05Z;Banks take on retailers over who foots cyber attacks bill;US lenders claim retailers must pay more after breaches;Banks are gearing up for a big fight with retailers over who covers the cost of cyber attacks, after they paid most of the bill for breaches that they blamed on retailers’ own security deficiencies.In a rare show of unity, industry bodies that represent banks are banding together to urge lawmakers to introduce legislation that would force retailers to pay for the clean-up themselves during the new session of Congress next year.The tussle between the two sectors comes as cyber attacks become an increasingly common problem for companies and highlights the difficulties in deciding who is responsible for the costs. Cyber attacks on retailers Home Depot and Target, for example, affected almost 100m credit cards in the past year.“This is an equity argument,” said Cam Fine, head of the Independent Community Bankers of America, which has about 5,000 members. “If it was Home Depot’s data security system that was breached, shouldn’t they have to reimburse banks for all of the costs since it wasn’t the banks’ fault? That’s just common sense.”The data breach at the retailer, which the company reported in September, cost community banks and credit unions at least $160m to reissue cards and pay for other services related to the attack. Home Depot estimated that the breach cost the company at least $62m.“The weak link in the system today is on the merchant end,” the National Association of Federal Credit Unions and the Credit Union National Association said last week in a letter to retailer and grocer groups. “As long as the security standards on the merchant side of the system are weaker than those on the financial institution side of the system, the vulnerability for consumers and financial institutions will be at your feet.”The Consumer Bankers Association and the Clearing House, which represents big banks such as JPMorgan, are also part of the effort. JPMorgan was the victim of a large cyber attack this summer.Banks and retailers have sparred for years over transaction costs, but the latest spate of cyber attacks has heightened animosity between the two groups and ended a brief detente reached this year. In February, retail and banking trade groups had announced a cyber security partnership to increase information-sharing and other initiatives.Retailers’ representatives rejected the banking industry’s claims. “The suggestion that retailers pay nothing is demonstrably false,” said Brian Dodge, executive vice-president at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a lobby group.The costs of unauthorised transactions on hacked credit cards were shared evenly between retailers and banks over time, he added, and retailers also contributed to the cost of reissuing cards.“This is an effort by the banks to obscure reality and benefit from an issue that’s a challenge to many businesses, not just retailers,” he said.Banks will be jostling with a host of other interest groups for the attention of Republicans, who won control of the Senate and tightened their grip on the House of Representatives in midterm elections last week. The organisations acknowledge they face challenges since the battle pits two powerful lobbying groups, the banking and retail industries, against each other.There are a few bills in Congress that would establish national standards for reporting cyber security breaches, but those proposals have stalled. One reason is that various committees in Congress all claim jurisdiction over cyber security issues, sparking turf wars that have delayed legislation.Banks have to meet the data protection criteria outlined in the 1999 Gramm Leach Bliley Act covering the financial industry, and they argue that similar standards are necessary for retailers and other businesses.“There are sympathies and loyalties for both industries in Congress so it’s not clear who will win this argument,” said a Senate aide. “But there is more of an urgency to do something because these breaches keep piling up.”

The sector had already secured $1.2bn of venture capital investment by August, overtaking the $1.1bn raised over the entire course of 2013, according to data collected by PrivCo.Corporate venture capital arms such as Citi Ventures are also starting to take stakes in start-ups that they hope will help protect their own companies from attack.Recent attacks on JPMorgan and US retailers Target and Home Depot have focused attention on the cyber security industry.As more companies use cloud services, whether it be Google, Amazon or Dropbox, they can find it harder to keep track of who has access to sensitive information and are often not even able to detect an intruder once a company’s defences have been compromised.Andrew Rubin, chief executive of Silicon Valley-based Illumio, whose customers include Morgan Stanley and Hollywood talent group Creative Artists Agency, said the company had also taken investment from conventional venture capital firms including Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst.“We wanted people who understood why the picture was so broken,” he said, adding that cyber security protections were increasingly being considered at board level after high-profile cyber attacks.Illumio also launched a platform focused on protecting data centres from the risk of cyber attacks.Steve Herrod, former chief technology officer for VMware and now managing director at venture capital firm General Catalyst Partners, led Illumio’s $34.5m series-B round fundraising. He said: “The customers involved at this early stage show it can be used across very large and regulated organisations, like Morgan Stanley, electronics manufacturers, telecoms carriers and Yahoo.”From viruses to hacking, we examine the dangers that can bedevil business ITFurther readingJeff Blair, chief information security officer for Creative Artists Agency, which represents stars from film and music to sports, said Illumio was helping it expand the number of people he could employ to look at security, because its offering was easy to use for non-security specialists. Cyber security professionals are in short supply and can command high salaries.“The security lay person, an app developer who doesn’t necessarily understand all the context around how the systems talk to each other, can be part of the security conversation instead of just having a small group of security professionals,” he said.

Before joining Home Depot, Mr Ellison spent 15 years with Target.He joins JC Penney as the century-old retailer struggles to recover from the disastrous tenure of former Apple executive Ron Johnson.Mr Johnson took over the company from Mr Ullman in November 2011, pledging to modernise it. Investors initially had high expectations of a man who had helped shape Apple’s highly successful stable of retail stores, but his efforts alienated customers and sales fell 25 per cent during the first year of his 17-month tenure.Mr Ullman took back the reins a year and a half ago, and the company – under pressure from activist investor Bill Ackman– soon began searching for a new chief executive. Mr Ullman has since brought back discounts, which Mr Johnson had eliminated, and kept the company more firmly focused on its traditional middle-income customer.Sales have since bounced back at JC Penney, which has cut thousands of jobs and closed dozens of outlets, leaving it with just over 1,000 stores. It posted a narrow loss last quarter, and Mr Ullman has announced plans to add around $2bn in new sales in the next three years by revamping its shoe and handbag departments.But the company continues to struggle, and last week cut its third-quarter sales forecast as shoppers seek out bargains amid a slow economic recovery.Its share price fell 0.4 per cent to $7.09 by close of trading in New York, adding to its 11 per cent decline over the past year and nearly 80 per cent decline over the past five years.Mr Ellison said in a statement that he would focus on “positioning the company to compete in a rapidly changing retail environment”.
70;HD;Home Depot;2014-10-02T22:15:37Z;JPMorgan cyber attack hits 76m households;Almost two-thirds of American homes affected;JPMorgan Chase said the names, addresses, telephone numbers and emails of 76m households – or just under two-thirds of the total households in America – were “compromised” in a cyber attack on the biggest US bank by assets.The bank said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that there was “no evidence that account information for such affected customers”, such as account numbers, dates of birth and social security numbers, were accessed.The attack is one of the biggest in terms of customers affected. However, it is less likely to put customers at financial risk than this year’s high-profile attacks at Target and Home Depot where the credit card information of tens of millions of the retailers’ customers was stolen.People close to the investigation said the cyber attack was believed to emanate from Russia. JPMorgan said it “continues not to have seen any unusual customer fraud related to this incident”.But Edward Markey, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, criticised JPMorgan and called for legislation to protect consumers’ data.“The data breach that has occurred is unacceptable,” he said. “JPMorgan Chase should immediately assess the extent to which customer information might have been taken, notify its customers without delay, and shore up its data security.”The cyber attack was first reported in August, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation saying it was working with the US Secret Service in the investigation.Initially the FBI said it was looking at reported attacks on “several American financial institutions”, but people at, or close to, the other major US banks have said they were not affected.The financial sector is a main target for cyber criminals, whether they are seeking to make a profit from customer data or confidential information about dealmaking, or are “hacktivists” or nation states wishing to make a political point. But the banks are also some of the best protected companies against cyber crime, with large numbers of security staff and customised software that many other companies cannot afford.Russia is home to many organised crime groups that have become expert in cyber crime, often to steal data to sell on underground markets but sometimes – for example, during the conflict with Ukraine – using it as part of a cyber war.This month, dozens of computers in the Ukrainian prime minister’s office and at least 10 of Ukraine’s embassies abroad have been infected with a cyber espionage weapon linked to Russia.In the filing on Thursday, JPMorgan said: “The firm continues to vigilantly monitor the situation and is continuing to investigate the matter. In addition, the firm is fully co-operating with government agencies in connection with their investigations.”The bank added that customers were “not liable for unauthorised transactions on their account that they promptly alert the firm to”.Earlier on Thursday the New York Times reported that JPMorgan might have been attacked for a second time, by a group with links to southern Europe. The bank denied that report.
71;HD;Home Depot;2014-09-30T13:38:32Z;Businesses spend less on cyber security despite rise in attacks;Budgets down 4% in 2014, according to PwC survey;Corporate cyber security budgets are falling despite a huge rise in the number of attacks and an increase in the financial losses they cause, according to a new report from PwC, the professional services group.In spite of recent high-profile attacks on Target and Home Depot, the US retailers, and JPMorgan, the investment bank, and widely reported vulnerabilities in the basic architecture of the internet, many companies have not increased their investments in cyber security.Global security budgets fell 4 per cent in 2014, compared with the year before, according to the survey of almost 10,000 executives and IT directors released on Tuesday.But the number of reported security incidents increased 48 per cent to 42.8m, the equivalent of almost 120,000 attacks a day. PwC estimates the average cost of managing and mitigating breaches rose to $2.7m per incident, over a third more than in 2013.David Burg, PwC’s global and US advisory cyber security leader, said the decline in spending – after three years of increases, including a jump last year – was “disappointing”.“There is a misconception out there that the security spend is this colossal block,” he said. “But it really is not. A lot of executives don’t have that level of awareness.”Security budgets at companies with less than $100m in revenues fell by an average of 20 per cent, while at medium and large businesses they edged up by 5 per cent.But Mr Burg warned large companies that their security also depends on the processes of their smaller vendors and suppliers. In the Target attack in late 2013, cyber criminals entered the computer network using access provided to a refrigeration and air conditioning supplier.“Many small and midsized companies themselves are connected to larger companies so the reality is the system in its totality is not more secure because large companies spend more,” he said. “There is no such thing as a standalone company.”Information security budgets fell most steeply among aerospace and defence companies, where they were cut by a quarter from the year before, which Mr Burg said could be a function of the financial pressures faced by the sector. The technology industry saw the second worst declines – down 21 per cent – with the motor industry suffering a 16 per cent fall in its security budgets.But funding for cyber security protections soared by two-thirds in the healthcare sector, as it woke up to the threat of cyber criminals targeting providers for their increasingly valuable patient data. The growth of a lively underground market in identity information has made healthcare companies even more of a target as they tend to hold a vast amount of personal information, from financial to medical.
72;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Tracks of our tears could hold key to cyber security;Scans of people’s tears could be used ‘instead of passwords’;Tears can expose our most private emotions but could they also secure our most private information online?Stephen Mason, an Australian optometrist, has discovered a new way to use scans of people’s tears as passwords which he calls “the world’s first one-time biometric pin”.He has focused on the cornea, rather than the iris, which is the norm in most optical scanners, because cyber criminals cannot copy the unique way tears change our eyes.The scanner can recognise a person because each cornea has a unique map. But if a criminal was to steal and try to use the data from the last time someone logged in, the machine would find it invalid because it expects the data to change slightly each time.“The corneal surface is wet with tears so our own data changes from moment to moment,” he said. “Each data set I capture from any eye has these really tiny variations.”The hope is that the technology could be included on smartphones, from where it could be used to verify payments and access services such as email or sensitive corporate documents online. It could also be embedded in ATMs or doors to access confidential areas.From intimate photos snatched and released online from celebrities’ Apple iCloud accounts to an attack on Home Depot, the largest known security breach of a retailer, the rise in cyber crime has experts searching for better ways to verify people’s identities.Simple passwords remain the most common way that individuals protect their data but many experts and technology companies believe this is an outdated form of protection and are turning to biometric alternatives.Identity X, a US-based security company, uses voice identification as one factor for identifying people trying to access banking services remotely. Barclays Bank is set to launch scanners in the UK to identify some corporate customers using the unique vein patterns in their fingers.Companies using more conventional fingerprint readers include Apple, which has one on its iPhone 5s and iPhone 6 devices, Samsung, which includes one on the most recent Galaxy handset, and Lenovo, the Chinese PC maker which has used them on its Thinkpad laptops.Vinny Sakore, cloud security manager at the International Computer Security Association Labs, a security testing company, said passwords are probably the main reason why systems are breached.One concern about existing biometric security systems is the risk of having the data stolen. Mr Mason said that people did not know what an exact copy of a fingerprint could be used for in the future.But biometric technology is not the only potential solution. Many start-ups are trying to solve the same security problem, from password managers which store encrypted passwords and enter them on each site, to hardware key fobs which contain codes that are difficult to crack.Mr Sakore cautioned that biometric technology “isn’t quite there yet”, with glitches such as not working with swollen fingers.
73;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Home Depot attack bigger than Target’s;;Home Depot said on Thursday that up to 56m payment card details may have been affected when it was hit by hackers, making the cyber attack much larger than the data breach on Target during the holiday shopping season last year.The US DIY retailer said the attack, now the largest breach of a retailer on record, lasted for five months before it was alerted to the problem on September 2, but that its systems were now safe from the hackers.Home Depot said it was working “around the clock” with security companies, banks and the US secret service to discover the source of the breach that it confirmed this month. It does not know at this stage how much data was actually stolen.Frank Blake, chairman and chief executive of Home Depot, said he apologised for the “inconvenience and anxiety” the attack had caused to customers. They will not be liable for fraudulent charges on the cards, he added.Shares in Home Depot drifted slightly lower in after-hours trading despite the company stressing that its financial performance would not be affected, unlike Target where earnings were hit after its breach.Home Depot reiterated its guidance for sales in 2014, up 4.8 per cent year on year, and increased its forecast for diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share for the full year will grow by 21 per cent to $4.54, higher than its previous guidance of $4.52, it said.However, the company warned that does not include an estimate for further costs relating to the breach which could include having to pay for customers’ cards to be reissued, future litigation and further capital investments in security.The Home Depot attack has affected more credit card details than the attack on Target late last year, where data about 70m customers were lost but only 40m cases involved card information.Well-resourced cybercriminals …are able to invest time in researching their targets to find a way into the network. Once they’re in, they stay quiet and fly unobserved under the radar, potentially for months at a timeThe Target breach last holiday shopping season hit that retailer’s earnings as it had to shell out for better security and incident response, while coping with some shoppers staying away. The breach led to the resignation of the chief executive and chief information officer.Cyber security companies said boardrooms across the world were shaken by the Target attack, which led to many companies increasing spending on cyber security.Home Depot said in a statement that the custom-built malicious software that hackers used to attack its systems had been eliminated and the company had added an extra layer of encryption at tills. Chip and pin technology, which can be more secure but is not yet commonly used in the US, will be in all Home Depot’s US stores by the end of the year, it said.Trey Ford, global security strategist at Rapid7, a US cyber security company, said the breach would cost Home Depot a lot of money, and that other large global retailers would be watching as the investigation continued.“This is why big box retailers are great targets for sophisticated, well-resourced cybercriminals. They are able to invest time in researching their targets to find a way into the network. Once they’re in, they stay quiet and fly unobserved under the radar, potentially for months at a time,” he said.
74;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Cyber security: first mover disadvantage;Everyone gets hacked, and cyber security shares are rising;"Target. Home Depot. Jennifer Lawrence. Everyone gets hacked, and cyber security shares are rising. Palo Alto Networks is up 70 per cent this year; Fortinet has risen a third. Gartner forecasts worldwide spending on cyber security will reach nearly $80bn next year, growing 8 per cent, more than twice as fast as IT spending overall.Profit remains behind the firewall, however. FireEye’s revenues more than doubled last year but it has never turned a profit. Palo Alto Networks saw revenues grow 50 per cent last year to $600m; its profit was all of $9m last quarter – news that sent its stock price up a tenth when announced on Wednesday.One challenge for these “next generation” security companies is that the price of becoming an established brand name is high. Huge sums are spent on marketing: FireEye’s costs here were 100 per cent of revenues in the last quarter. Palo Alto Networks’ were lower, but still high, at 50 per cent.The first movers say their products are superior, but the secrecy of the security industry works against them. Without information on attacks and breaches, it is nearly impossible to determine whose software is best. Anecdotal evidence is often the only kind. Independent testing is difficult and often irrelevant: attacks come in totally new forms. And once a new concept is proven – such as FireEye’s “simulated sandbox” approach – it is soon mimicked by bigger brands. Hence the marketing budgets.The system is stacked against the first movers in another way too: high-security enterprises like banks and casinos layer new products over existing ones, guaranteeing a certain level of sales for the old guard. This is where the value is, too: FireEye’s enterprise value is seven times this year’s expected sales (even after its share price has fallen two-thirds from a March peak). Palo Alto Networks, at nine times, is more expensive, having turned the corner on profitability. Compare those valuations to the less sexy Symantec, trading at two times – and which is profitable. Despite firing its chief executive in March, Symantec’s plodding stock has risen 5 per cent in the past year. That looks like the more secure bet.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com"
75;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Mobileye jumps as analysts climb aboard;;Mobileye shares advanced after brokerage Morgan Stanley lifted its expectations for the company on the view that it will continue to win new business and maintain its leading market position.Analysts with the investment bank say the company, which makes software, chips and other applications that process visual data to stop cars from colliding, is exposed to two of the “most powerful and fastest growing trends” in the auto sector: autonomous cars and software.“Mobileye’s superior technology and early start in the vision space mean that it has a five- to 10-year lead over rivals today,” said Ravi Shanker, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.“Management’s top priority should be capitalising on this lead to lock up as many large platforms as it can, without sacrificing pricing and margins.”Mobileye’s products are currently in use in roughly a fifth of vehicle models produced currently, Morgan Stanley said, and its customer base includes Ford, General Motors, Honda, Nissan and BMW.Gains are contingent on wins from automakers including Volkswagen and Toyota, Mr Shanker said, which will fuel global growth.He noted that competitive threats were “not lurking around the corner” and the company was steadily outpacing rivals.“We believe this will be even harder to achieve for the competition as Mobileye continues to add new features on the same hardware including semi- and fully autonomous driving capability,” he said.Mr Shanker increased his target price on Mobileye from $46 to $65. The company has been buoyed by an optimistic analyst community.Three-fourths of analysts who cover the company recommend Mobileye a buy, according to data from Bloomberg.Shares in the company climbed 7 per cent to $56.60, taking its advance since its debut this year to more than 52 per cent.McDonald’s said on Tuesday that the safety scare at one of its suppliers in China will cost the company between 15 cents and 20 cents a share in the quarter because of lost sales and the costs of “recovery efforts”.Sales in Asia-Pacific were down 14.5 per cent in August from a year earlier.The safety scare in China, which also struck Yum Brands, adds to headaches for chief executive Don Thompson.Sales in the US continued to fall last month, McDonald’s said. Same-store sales declined 2.8 per cent in the country, adding to a 3.7 per cent drop in comparable sales globally.McDonald’s shares fell 2 per cent to $91.09 while rival Burger King declined 1 per cent to $31.85 and Yum slipped less than 1 per cent to $72.07.Organic food company Annie’s soared 38 per cent to $46.10 after it said General Mills would purchase the company for $46 a share.The deal, worth $820m, is expected to close later this year. Executives with Annie’s said the combination would allow it to expand its reach and increase efficiency.General Mills shares fell less than a per cent to $53.17.Home Depot confirmed that its payment data systems were breached, leaving customers who shopped at US and Canadian stores potentially exposed.Home Depot, whose shares have dropped since disclosing last week that it was investigating a possible breach, said on Monday that it will offer card monitoring services to anyone who used a payment card at a Home Depot store from April.The company’s shares fell 2 per cent to $88.93.Barnes & Noble, the US books retailer, climbed 3 per cent to $24.09 on Tuesday – its highest level since 2009 – after it said its quarterly loss was narrower than Wall Street expectations.The company reported a loss of $28.4m, or 56 cents a share, on revenues of $1.2bn. Analysts had forecast a loss of 63 cents per share.Same-store book sales, which exclude the Nook, fell 0.4 per cent in the quarter from a year ago.The figure was better than the 1.9 per cent decline recorded in the prior quarter, when severe winter weather crimped February traffic.Overall, US equity markets slipped on Tuesday ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting. The S&P 500 declined 0.7 per cent to 1,988.44 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 17,013.87.

76;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Home Depot confirms hackers breached payment systems;;Home Depot, the US DIY retailer, has confirmed that its payment systems were breached by hackers and data could have been stolen from customers who shopped at any of its US or Canadian stores.The investigation started last Tuesday, when banks and law enforcement officials informed the retailer of a possible breach, but the company is looking as far back as April to pinpoint when the hack happened and how much customer data were put at risk, the company said.“We owe it to our customers to alert them that we now have enough evidence to confirm that a breach has indeed occurred,” said Frank Blake, chairman and chief executive, in a statement.The number of customers affected remains unclear, the company said, and it does not affect people who shopped at its website.But the breach, security experts said, could compare in scope to the theft that hit US retailer Target earlier this year, in which data on 40m credit and debit cards were stolen.Detecting intrusions early remains one of the trickier challenges facing retailers and others trying to boost their cyber security, analysts say. The complexity of modern software systems creates more chances of bugs and makes them harder to notice.“You’d think these things would be better and you’d detect attacks when they happen, but these systems are increasingly complicated – there are millions and millions of lines of code, and no one’s watching every line of code execute,” said Jeff Williams, chief technology officer of Contrast Security, which develops internet security products.John Kindervag, a Forrester security analyst, said it was also a challenge for retailers to upgrade point of sale systems – where credit cards are first swiped and processed – to make them fully secure.A flaw in Target’s POS system allowed hackers access to customer data. While Home Depot has not yet confirmed how the breach happened, many security analysts pointed to a possible flaw with a POS system, which might have been processing card numbers without encryption or so-called tokenisation.“If they tokenised the numbers properly, then the POS terminal attacks wouldn’t have worked,” he said.Home Depot says it was working with banks, third-party security firms, and the US Secret Service to investigate the breach. It is also offering free identity protection services and credit monitoring for any customer who used a card in one of its stores from April of this year.The retailer also said it was on target to meet its previously announced plan to update all of its US credit card readers by the end of this year to so-called “chip and PIN” cards. That system, which requires both a swipe and a PIN to process a payment, is widely used in Europe and significantly more secure than the simple swipe payment process that now dominates in the US.
77;HD;Home Depot;2014-09-03T16:27:25Z;Home Depot probes possible data theft;;Home Depot, the largest DIY chain in the US, sought to reassure consumers as it investigated reports of a mass theft of customers’ payment data.The chain said that if it confirmed a breach, it would offer free identity protection services and credit monitoring to customers who might be affected. It also reminded customers that their banks or the retailer itself would be responsible for any fraudulent charges on their cards.“We’re looking into some unusual activity that might indicate a possible payment data breach,” the company said. “We know that this news may be concerning and we apologise for the worry this can create.”If the possible attack is confirmed, it would be the latest in a growing number of data breaches by hackers on US retailers and banks.Brian Krebs, a well-known cyber security analyst who first reported the possible issues at Home Depot, said in a blog post that the suspected theft of card data from the company could be larger than the data theft of 40m credit and debit cards from Target earlier this year, based on information he had received from banks.After closing 2.5 per cent lower on Tuesday, Home Depot’s shares fell a further 2.4 per cent by close of trading on Wednesday.The increasing complexity of software and automation of business functions is contributing to a rise in large-scale attacks, said Jeff Williams, chief technology officer of Contrast Security, which develops internet security products. In addition to Target, online retailer eBay said in May that hackers had accessed millions of customers’ user names and other personal data.“If Home Depot pans out to be a Target-sized breach then three of the biggest breaches in all of history will have been in the last year, which is exceptional,” said Mr Williams. “As systems get more complex and more critical they’re easier to attack and more vulnerable to attack.”The theft of Target’s customer data ended up costing the retailer nearly $20m of related expenses in the first quarter and pushed it to replace its chief executive and cut its full-year forecast.Authorities including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US Secret Service recently launched an investigation into a wave of cyber attacks against financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank by assets.If Home Depot pans out to be a Target-sized breach then three of the biggest breaches in all of history will have been in the last year, which is exceptionalCyber security researchers said retailers were proving to be equally alluring targets because they hold massive amounts of financial data but their security systems are rarely as sophisticated as those of large banks.The weak security on credit cards used in the US also makes it relatively easy for cyber thieves to steal the data, said Jaime Blasco, a researcher at security company AlienVault. Europe uses so-called “chip and pin” cards, which require a code to work. The US is only now requiring banks to use those more secure cards, a transition that will not be completed until next year.“Most of the biggest breaches that we are seeing are happening here in the US, and the problem is with these old credit card systems,” said Mr Blasco. “In Europe we have been using chip and pin credit cards for 10 years, and we don’t have those problems any more.”Mr Krebs said data suspected of being stolen from Home Depot were put up for sale on Tuesday via an underground online forum. Similarities with the Target breach, he wrote on his blog, suggested the same group of hackers could be responsible for both attacks.
78;HD;Home Depot;2014-08-29T17:20:20Z;US financials enjoy strong August gains;Nine in 10 S&P 500 stocks advance as economic data improve;Investors returned to US equity markets in August, sending the benchmark S&P 500 up 3.7 per cent – its best performance since February – as economic data broadly improved.Nine in 10 stocks on the S&P 500 advanced during the month, led by those companies tied to an expanding economy, including the financial, technology and consumer goods sectors.Financials proved particularly attractive, seeing the greatest monthly advance since the autumn of 2013 after lagging behind broader equity markets this year.Pummelled by increased regulation and lacklustre economic growth at the start of the year, investors shifted their view on banks in the period, sending the S&P 500 financials index up 4.9 per cent over the month.Asset managers and financial service providers accounted for much of the gains, although nearly 98 per cent of stocks within the index climbed over the period.Analysts with Credit Suisse noted the financial sector had been aided by improving credit quality and loans, in part buoyed by the five-year bull market rally. Higher capital ratios have also left banks less vulnerable to unexpected shocks.“Credit quality trends improved, although at a slowing pace,” Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with the bank, said of second-quarter results. “Loan loss reserves continue to decline at every large bank in our coverage universe.”The end of stimulus measures in the US could lift the sector as well, as spreads on some products rise. Improving economic data in August have also buoyed the sector, as rising manufacturing and construction activity point to increased lending needs.Jonathan Glionna, a strategist with Barclays, said net interest margins were likely to improve as the Federal Reserve lifted rates. He noted interest income represented 60 per cent of average revenue at S&P 500 banks.“Their balance sheets are positioned to respond favourably to higher interest rates,” Mr Glionna said. “In addition, banks will benefit from the economic conditions that typically coincide with higher interest rates, such as lower unemployment.”Strategists with Goldman Sachs said cyclical stocks, including technology companies, could benefit in the 12 months ahead of a rate rise – which it expects will happen by autumn 2015.“Cyclical equities tend to outperform the index during the lead-up to rate hikes,” David Kostin, a strategist with Goldman, said. “Information technology has outperformed on average, although these results are skewed by the dotcom bubble coinciding with the interest rate hikes of 1999.”Genworth Financial climbed 8 per cent during the month to $14.19, Morgan Stanley advanced 6 per cent to $34.31, BlackRock rose 8 per cent to $330.53 and Hartford Financial increased 8 per cent to $37.05.Companies tied to the US consumer, including Ross Stores, Home Depot and Gap, also rallied over the course of the month, despite discounting by rivals and weak mall traffic.The movement was tied to earnings, as all three eclipsed Wall Street expectations. Both Gap and Home Depot lifted guidance, on rosier second half expectations.Analysts with IHS noted the back-to-school selling season looked relatively good, although overall growth would probably fall short of the 2013 rate when sales in the period reached $573bn.Ross gained 17 per cent in August to $75.42, Home Depot climbed 15 per cent to $93.50 and Gap rose 15 per cent to $46.15.Telecoms was the only sector to decline over the month, as investors sold off positions in AT&T, Windstream Holdings and Verizon.Higher interest rates may constrain the industry’s performance, Mr Glionna warned, particularly as the companies make infrastructure investments.AT&T fell 2 per cent over the month to $34.96 while Windstream declined 1 per cent to $11.30.For the month, the S&P 500 advanced 3.8 per cent to 2,003.37, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.2 per cent to 17,098.45 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 4.8 per cent to 4,580.27.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
79;HD;Home Depot;2014-08-21T13:16:13Z;Techtronic: trade of the tools;Hong Kong manufacturer deserves more attention;"Americans are hammering, drilling and sanding. Home Depot’s very strong numbers this week, and respectable results from its weak sibling Lowe’s, show as much.Hong Kong tool manufacturer Techtronic has benefited. First-half profit, announced on Thursday, increased 16 per cent year on year, just shy of the 20 per cent Home Depot achieved. Techtronic’s outlook, like Home Depot’s, was positive. The similarities end there. Home Depot has rallied nearly one-tenth since reporting; Techtronic dropped 6 per cent.Owner of brands including Ryobi, Hoover and Milwaukee, Techtronic looks, from many angles, as attractive as the retailer. Techtronic says it has been gaining market share from the competition, which includes Bosch, Makita and Stanley Black & Decker. Its 10 per cent revenue growth outpaced the market; Europe (a fifth of sales) grew at an even faster 15 per cent. Even in countries such as the UK, where the desire for home improvement has been waning and third-party handymen are becoming more popular, Techtronic’s exposure to higher margin professional tools allows the company to benefit.The good news does not end there. Gross margins have been slowly expanding across the group, and stand at 35 per cent. With margins at Makita and Stanley around 2 per cent higher, there may be room for more. Over a third of Techtronic’s revenues come from innovative products. While not always as high end as those made by its competitors, Techtronic’s new products are faster to market and boost margins.Compared with Home Depot, trading on 20 times expected earnings, TTI, at 18 times, looks cheap given its lively growth rate. Stanley trades at a slightly lower multiple – 17 – but has half the growth. And Techtronic is generating enough cash to increase the dividend. Techtronic has outperformed Home Depot, Makita and Stanley over one, three and five years. That pattern looks set to continue.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com"
80;HD;Home Depot;2014-08-20T17:20:47Z;Lowe’s trims sales hopes but holds ground;;Shares in Lowe’s the home improvement company, retained their value after two days of gains ahead of its latest results. The US chain, which competes with Home Depot for DIY purchases, stuck to its annual profit forecast despite trimming its sales expectations.The retailer, which is headquartered in North Carolina, expected total sales to be 4.5 per cent higher for the year to the end of January and same-store sales to be 3.5 per cent higher.Those predictions were down from 5 per cent and 4 per cent that Lowe’s gave at the time of its first-quarter results in late May.Robert Niblock, chief executive of Lowe’s, said the diluted earnings per share outlook was unchanged, in a “testament to our keen focus on profitability”.Like its arch rival Home Depot, which cheered investors with better than expected profits on Tuesday, Lowe’s has benefited from the rebound in the US housing market since national prices touched a bottom in the middle of 2012.Its profits for the second quarter rose to $1.04bn, or $1.04 a share, from $941m, or 88 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenues climbed to $16.6bn from $10.3bn. Both figures topped analysts’ forecasts.Shares in Lowe’s, which have lagged behind those of Home Depot over the past five years, added nearly 2 per cent at $52.33.Building on gains earlier in the week, shares in Home Depot continued to rise, up another 3 per cent to $90.75.Overall, the US retail sector held its ground despite a tempering of expectations from some key consumer companies in their latest results.The S&P retail index remained up 4.6 per cent so far for the month of August, in anticipation of the earnings season, against the overall rise in the broader S&P 500 index of 2.9 per cent.Shares in food company JM Smucker fell 1 per cent at $102.42 after the company reported lower than expected profits and sales.For the three months ended July 31, net income at the company fell 8 per cent to $116m, while sales fell 2 per cent to $1.3bn.The owner of the Folgers and Dunkin’ Donuts brands derives most of its profits from the coffee businesses. A rise in costs from increased promotions squeezed profit margins and weighed on sales.However its retail consumer foods segment offset the declines, with increased sales of Jif and Smucker’s Uncrustables frozen sandwiches.Shares in Petsmart rose 1 per cent to $70.52 after the company said on Tuesday it would explore sale options and posted mixed quarterly results.The company, which has been under pressure from Jana Partners to sell itself since the activist investor took an almost 10 per cent stake in July, said it will examine options for the business including finding a buyer.Although the pet supplies market has been a growing one, Petsmart’s margins have faced an increasing threat as more pet owners shop online. As a result, the retailer said it had “embarked on a broad cost reduction program that will fundamentally restructure the cost base of the company”.While the company had beat earnings estimates by 4 cents a share, it fell $1m short on revenue. Its same-store sales fell 0.5 per cent.Shares in American Eagle Outfitters rose 12 per cent at $12.98 after the teen retailer reported higher than expected profits and sales in the second quarter. Ahead of estimates, the company earned $5.8m, or 3 cents a share, during the period ended August 2, down from $19.6m, or 10 cents a share, last year.The shares have recovered from a year-low reached in May this year of $10.12.Overall US equities were stronger following a minutes release from the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting in July. The S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent at 1,986.51, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent at 16,979.13. The Nasdaq Composite was flat at 4,526.48.
81;HD;Home Depot;2014-08-19T17:41:31Z;Home Depot: head of household;Kids cannot afford to leave home, but that’s OK for Home Depot;"If you are among the millions of young Americans still living with your parents because you cannot afford a home of your own, chances are you spent the summer fixing your dad’s man-cave or your mum’s garden patio. Home Depot would prefer it if you moved out to form your own household. But in the meantime it appreciates your help: that is why the DIY monster lifted its full-year profit forecast Tuesday after strong second-quarter results. The bullish outlook was rewarded: shares jumped 5 per cent, adding to its stellar rise over the past two years. Its stock has doubled in value since 2012 – outperforming the S&P 500.Is this going to last? Household formations are sluggish; new, privately owned housing units are far from the highs of the 2000s; and single-family home sales remain flat. Yet that has been the case for the past two years and Home Depot has kept on growing based on its execution, unlike certain peers. After the housing crash, the company put an end to decades of expansion, sold non-core units and focused on its big orange stores. It cut costs and invested with calibration: return on invested capital was 22 per cent (double most of its rivals).Labour demand is growing, payrolls are back to pre-crisis highs, and loan volumes have risen on better lending conditions. Still, average hourly earnings remain low and labour participation is down. An increase in interest rates in 2015 will dampen spending. In this scenario Home Depot’s streamlined business is better off than competitors such as Lumber Liquidators and Tractor Supply, which are suffering more from the housing doldrums. With its shares trading 18 times forward earnings – a little higher than its historical average – Home Depot has space to grow. Especially if a few more of America’s under-30s finally get a chance to start a new life away from mum and dad.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com"
82;HD;Home Depot;2014-08-19T17:08:07Z;Home Depot benefits from DIY resurgence;;Home Depot hammered out a strong performance in a resurgence in the retail sector, joining US chain store groups to report better results for the latest quarter.America’s largest DIY chain reported second-quarter earnings and same-store sales that both topped Wall Street’s expectations and raised its full-year profit forecast, sending its shares up nearly 6 per cent to $88.19.Same-store sales at its 2,264 stores in the US climbed 5.8 per cent, eclipsing a 4.4 per cent forecast, and pushing overall revenues up 5.7 per cent to $23.8bn as customers spent more on home repairs after a severe North American winter.Profits climbed 14.2 per cent to $2.1bn, or $1.52 a share. The company expected to earn $1.44 a share.The retailer also promised another $3.5bn worth of share buybacks for the rest of the year.Home Depot’s shares had previously lagged behind the broader S&P 500 index performance. However, by the close of trading it had matched the overall market gain of 7.6 per cent in the year to date.Fresh optimism over the consumer and housing sector also lifted shares in Lowe’s, another home improvement retailer, ahead of its second-quarter earnings expected on Wednesday.Shares rose 2 per cent to $51.52, building on gains on Monday after Credit Suisse analysts upgraded the company to a ‘buy’ recommendation.Among other retailers to shine was TJX Companies, owner of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, surging almost 9 per cent at $58.56.The company reported an 8 per cent increase in net income for the quarter ended August 2, earning $518m over the period.Higher than expected store sales drove earnings, in addition to improved merchandise margins and clothing sales, the company said.The company reported an adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents, exceeding analysts’ expectations of 73 cents. The retailer also narrowed its full-year earnings forecast to a range between $3.08 and $3.16 per share, from between $3.05 and $3.17 previously.Shares in Ross Stores, a fellow discount retailer, rose 4 per cent at $69.31 on the back of the more positive sector news, ahead of its own second-quarter earnings release on Thursday.Teen clothing retailer Aéropostale regained investor confidence after reappointing Julian Geiger as its chief executive. During his previous stint as CEO between 1996 and 2009, Mr Geiger helped grow sales to $1.9bn by 2008.News of the appointment sent the shares up 19 per cent to $3.87. However the company’s stock is still nearly 60 per cent lower than a year ago.The ever fickle teen market has plagued a number of companies.Shares in Elizabeth Arden fell 23 per cent at $15.05 after announcing a worse than expected sales decline in the fourth quarter. The beauty products company reported a net loss of $157m, or $5.24 a share.Poor sales of celebrity fragrances, such as Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift brands, contributed to the decline. Revenues plunged 28 per cent in the three months ended in June, to $192m, a significantly bigger decline than analysts had expected.In a bid to reassure investors, Elizabeth Arden said next year it would continue to focus on stabilising the business as it embarked on a multiyear plan to restore profitability. It also announced a strategic investment by Rhône Capital, the private equity firm that last year took an investment in Arden competitor Coty.Shares in the home building sector had a second day of gains on the basis of improving data. Following on a positive home builder sentiment survey released the previous day, the latest report from the US commerce department showed the pace of building on new homes rebounded in July to its highest level since November.Shares in PulteGroup rose 1 per cent to $19.06, DR Horton added 3 per cent to $21.82 and Lennar gained 3 per cent to $38.80.Overall US equities were stronger. The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent at 1,981.60, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent at 16,919.59. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.4 per cent at 4,527.51.
83;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Kingfisher: drill down;The first quarter disappointed but return on equity is ticking up;Get out the cross cut saw and the combi drill. There is work to do. Return on capital at DIY retailer Kingfisher was just over 10 per cent last year. That is not great – Home Depot makes twice that. Changing the “return” part of the equation is tough. Growth in Kingfisher’s British and French markets languishes in the low single-digits. And, as shown by Thursday’s first-quarter results, weather plays a part. An awful first quarter last year flattered this year's numbers – a 19 per cent jump in profits is not a long term run rate. Neither was it what analysts were expecting (the miss knocked 5 per cent off the share price).The other way to improve return on capital is to hammer the capital into a better shape. Chief executive Sir Ian Cheshire is going at this with gusto. First, he’s making better use of space, for instance by selling or subletting underused parts of its B&Q stores. And where Kingfisher is expanding, it is doing so via the Brico Dépôt and Screwfix formats, which have better sales densities than big box outlets.Second, he is busy with M&A. In March, he sold Kingfisher’s 21 per cent stake in German DIY group Hornbach for €236m. Good move. Unless there is any chance of control (and in this case there was not), companies have little reason to own shares in other listed companies. Sir Ian is also trying to buy French rival Mr Bricolage for around €275m. This looks odd as the French market is weak (first quarter like for like sales growth was just 1.6 per cent). Still, if Kingfisher can generate decent cost savings, the deal may be worthwhile.Finally, Sir Ian is returning cash to shareholders. The group ended the last financial year with net cash of £238m. Add that to the proceeds of the Hornbach disposal and it can fund investment and return £200m to shareholders. Pull it all together and return on capital should tick up.

84;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Retailers drag Wall Street lower;;US retailers lagged behind the broader market as results from some of the industry’s most watched companies fell short of Wall Street expectations.Forecasts from retailers in segments of the market as disparate as sporting goods, office supplies and apparel also failed to spark investor enthusiasm.Staples, the largest US office supply retailer, was one of the companies hardest hit by poor guidance and lacklustre first-quarter results.The company said North American commercial sales climbed just 1 per cent last quarter as demand for ink, toner and paper all fell.Profit margins weakened as the chain discounted other items to compensate.Profit for the quarter to May 3 fell to $96m from $170m in the same period a year earlier. Overall sales slid to $5.65bn from $5.8bn.The retailer is cutting 225 outlets as it tries to shield profits as demand dissipates for its core products and competition from online-only rivals such as Amazon intensifies.Staples warned there would be no reversal of the sales trend this quarter.As a result, it expects to earn between 9 cents and 14 cents a share, excluding restructuring costs, shy of the 15 cents Wall Street forecast.Shares in the company slid 13 per cent to $11.71 by close of trading Tuesday, leading the declines on the benchmark S&P 500 and dragging the SPDR S&P Retail ETF 2 per cent lower to $81.83.Dick’s Sporting Goods shares slumped 18 per cent to $43.60 after the retailer warned profits for the full year would be lower than forecast, weighing on the sporting goods sector.Investors took fright at the company’s fresh forecast for the year, which included earnings per share between $2.70 and $2.85, as much as 12 per cent below earlier guidance.Peer Cabelas dipped 5 per cent to $61.24 while Callaway Golf slid 9 per cent to $7.60.Shares of Urban Outfitters fell 9 per cent to $32.98 after the company said sales at its eponymous brand continued to decline while sales at its upscale women’s chain, Anthropologie, offset that weakness.First-quarter sales at Anthropologie jumped over 10 per cent, to $295.8m, while sales at the Urban Outfitters chain fell 5 per cent to $277.7m, marking the first time Anthropologie has eclipsed the company’s namesake chain.The Philadelphia-based retailer reported earnings of 26 cents a share, missing expectations by a penny. Total group revenues rose nearly 6 per cent to $686.3m, ahead of expectations.“We believe that Urban Outfitters is challenged by a competitive teen/young adult environment and high price points relative to competitors,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Susan Anderson said.JC Penney shares also faltered on Tuesday, after investment bank Wells Fargo downgraded the company to ‘underperform’ from ‘market perform’, citing its rapidly rising valuation.Analyst Paul Lejuez notes the company would need to achieve $1.1bn in earnings to have a similar equity valuation-to-ebitda multiple as Macy’s, which he calls the “clear winner in the mid-tier department store space”. Its shares fell nearly 5 per cent to $8.93.Home Depot was a lone bright spot on the day, rising 2 per cent to $77.96 after executives said they expected full-year sales to rise in line with earlier guidance as weather effects dissipate and the housing market re-accelerates.For the quarter to May 4, profits at Home Depot rose 12.5 per cent to $1.38bn from $1.23bn in the same quarter a year earlier.Sales rose just under 3 per cent to $19.7bn, shy of Wall Street’s forecasts of $19.95bn.Excluding a one-time benefit from the sale of its stake in materials supplier HD Supply, Home Depot earned $1 a share in the quarter, ahead of forecasts.Overall, US equities flickered lower as the S&P 500 continued to drift within a relatively tight range.The S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,872.83 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.8 per cent to 16,374.31.

A deal is not certain and the process is at an early stage, however.Oak Hill bought Ohio-based Hillman in 2010 for $815m. The hardware group, which also sells hinges, door locks and cuts keys, employs 2,500 people and trades through retailers including Home Depot and Walmart.The sale process comes at a time of feverish activity in global mergers and acquisitions, with the combination of cheap debt and rising corporate confidence driving levels of dealmaking not seen since the start of the financial crisis. In April, the value of global M&A passed $1tn – the first time it has done so at that point in the year since 2007.Private equity groups have already sold businesses worth billions of dollars – many that were acquired at the start of the financial crisis – into the rising market.On Monday, Blackstone was part of a consortium that sold Pinnacle Foods to Hillshire for $6.6bn, including debt.Hillman and Oak Hill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Most notably, the average transaction size of purchased public companies has swelled to $6.4bn.”Shares of Allergan climbed 15.25 per cent to $163.65.Overall, the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 1,879.55 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.4 per cent to 16,514.37. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.97 per cent to 4,161.46.
87;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Square targets US’s 50m Latinos (and their small businesses);;Square, the payments processing start-up, is looking for new users for its credit card device among the US’s growing Latino community.The company, co-founded by Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, is today unveiling Spanish language support and software in hopes of tapping into the purchasing power of America’s more than 50m Latinos.US consumer goods and media companies have long wisened up to the purchasing power of the country’s Spanish-speaking population, but tech start-ups have not tended to target that demographic. Instead, even when they offer foreign-language interfaces, they rarely make a point of pitching them to minority or immigrant markets in the US itself. (It might be not unrelated to the fact that Latino Americans, as with African Americans, are very underrepresented on the staffs of most tech companies.)“It’s inherently viewed as a risky, small market,” says Ricardo Reyes, the executive in charge of the launch who is normally responsible for branding for Square.Square, however, took note of the fact that Latino-Americans launch and run small businesses at an unusually high rate, explains Mr Reyes, who was himself born in Nicaragua. That, he said, made them a natural fit for Square, which aims to partner with merchants who want to accept credit cards but whose businesses are too small to work with traditional card networks. It does not release exact figures but says it has millions of customers and processes tens of billions of dollars of payments.In Texas, by their count, one in five businesses is Latino-owned, going up to nearly one in four in Florida. In terms of population, over 15 per cent of US residents are Latino, according to Pew, the polling and research firm.“We had to take this almost the way we would take a country launch,” he said.They are adding Spanish-language customer support and are launching a new website localised for the Latino community. While the English website appeals to businesses such as small cafes or hipster designers, the Spanish site is aimed at the more traditional small business market — bakers, builders, corner store owners. They also added Spanish to the packaging used on the card readers, which are sold both online and in stores like Walmart and Home Depot.“Home Depot is very excited about this … a lot of folks go to Home Depot and they’re contractors, and a lot of contractors are Hispanic,” said Mr Reyes.Developing a product for the market, however, was not entirely straightforward.The team on the project wrestled with how to target Latino users effectively, while not appearing as if they were stereotyping what is a diverse and often marginalized community. Mr Reyes said he had to push his team to hesitate less.“We don’t have to be tepid about this. If we’re going to do it let’s embrace the culture and let’s get it,” he said. He adds: “But it also helps that my name is Ricardo Reyes.”
88;HD;Home Depot;2014-02-25T21:35:10Z;Tesla hits record on electric utility hopes;;Tesla shares rocketed to a new record high after analysts at Morgan Stanley more than doubled their price target on the carmaker and suggested it could enter and gain significant share in the $2tn electric utility industry.Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley analyst, said the investment bank no longer viewed Tesla solely as a niche premium auto manufacturer following the company’s announcement that it would construct its own lithium ion battery factory.Mr Jonas says a plant – named the “+” – that can produce more than 1bn cells a year has the potential to disrupt the US energy storage business and the country’s electrical grid.Elon Musk, Tesla chief executive, has promised to provide more details on the plant in the near future.The decision, which will also remove one of the crucial bottlenecks in Tesla’s supply chain, could propel it to the top of the electric storage sector, Mr Jonas said.“Tesla’s quest to disrupt a trillion-dollar car industry offers an adjacent opportunity to disrupt a trillion-dollar electric utility industry,” he said. “If it can be a leader in commercialising battery packs, investors may never look at Tesla the same way again.”Mr Jonas believes Tesla will also find itself more successful in the auto sector. He now forecasts the company will reach 1m vehicle sales by 2027.Tesla is rated overweight with a $320 price target at Morgan Stanley. Shares rose 13.9 per cent to $248 by the close of trading in New York.Retailers advanced on Tuesday, following comments from executives at Macy’s and Home Depot that pointed to an improving climate after icy weather kept consumers at home at the start of the year.Profits at Macy’s rose 11 per cent to $811m, or $2.16 per diluted share, a penny below forecasts.The second-largest US department store said sales fell 1.6 per cent from a year earlier to $9.2bn, shy of Wall Street expectations, as severe winter weather forced it to close 244 stores.Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said sales remained sluggish through mid-February but he expected to see a rebound when consumers begin their much anticipated defrost.“Once warm spring weather arrives and our full assortment of fresh spring merchandise is in place, we believe customers will return to a more normalised pattern of shopping,” Mr Lundgren said.Shares in Macy’s rose 6 per cent to $56.25 while rivals Sears increased 2.5 per cent to $38.99 and JC Penney climbed 7.6 per cent to $5.63.An improving US housing market fed through to the home improvement sector, allowing Home Depot to lift its dividend by 21 per cent.The company said earnings per share were 73 cents for the period, slightly ahead of analysts’ estimates, as revenues, adjusted for a change that shortened the company’s fourth-quarter reporting period from 14 weeks to 13 weeks, rose 3.9 per cent to $17.7bn.Excluding that adjustment, sales fell 3 per cent from a year earlier. Home Depot shares advanced 4 per cent to $80.98.Office Depot, the seller of printer paper and pens, fell at the sharpest pace in more than a year after the company said it expected sales in the current year to decline from a year earlier.The company, which continues to integrate the OfficeMax chain following its merger, reported its quarterly loss widened eightfold to $144m, or 34 cent per diluted share, in the three months to the end of December.Shares in Office Depot declined 8.8 per cent to $4.88.US equity markets were little changed following weaker-than-anticipated reports on consumer confidence and regional manufacturing activity.The closely watched US consumer sentiment survey declined in February as consumers said they expected business conditions to deteriorate in the near future.The S&P 500 was down 0.13 per cent to 1,845.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.17 per cent to 16,179.66. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was off 0.13 per cent at 4,287.59.

The figures are equivocal for the US paint company. Is it a speciality chemical maker or a vertically integrated building supplies company? The distinction makes a big difference to how the shares are valued.Increasingly Sherwin sells paint direct to contractors via its own high-margin paint stores and less through DIY retailers such as Home Depot. The proportion has risen steadily from two-fifths in 1980 to almost three-fifths today. Contractors want professional advice when they buy and they get it in the stores. So while Sherwin trades at a premium to speciality chemicals companies, it is in line with home improvement retailers and at a discount to makers of building supplies.Moreover, Sherwin and its main rival PPG control a third of the architectural coatings market in North America. No surprise, then, that the company’s return on equity is more than 40 per cent and rising – higher than during the housing boom. Can Sherwin maintain these high returns?One possibility: buy some growth. Sherwin wants to expand in Latin America via Comex, the leading Mexican paint maker. But regulators there are wary. They fear that a combined company would dominate the market and have blocked the deal. Sherwin has already raised the funds for the acquisition. However, if it must surrender on Comex, it can return that cash to shareholders via buybacks. Shrinking equity can lift returns and boost the share price.Between 2008 and 2012 Sherwin returned nearly three-quarters of available cash flow to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. The run rate for 2013 has been similar. Without Comex, even more buybacks should follow. All this paints a rosy picture for the shares.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
90;HD;Home Depot;2013-12-27T12:32:18Z;US bricks-and-mortar retailers seek online success;;"When people buy more online, traditional retailers suffer – or so the well-worn narrative goes. The reality, however, is not so simple. Bricks-and-mortar stores lose out as ecommerce grows, but most old school retailers have now supplemented their shops with online businesses, and some are winning a growing share of the digital market.At Best Buy, an electronics chain, US online sales rose 15 per cent to $499m in the quarter to the start of November. At Home Depot, which sells DIY supplies, online sales rose 50 per cent to about $600m in the same period. Walmart expects its global online sales to rise 30 per cent to $13bn next year.The rates of growth are impressive, but such figures are more easily achieved because they are coming from low bases. Ecommerce often still represents a small proportion of total sales: 6 per cent at Best Buy, 3 per cent at Home Depot and less than 3 per cent at Walmart.By comparison, online sales are likely to make up 11 per cent of all retail spending in the current quarter, which includes the crucial Christmas shopping season, according to ComScore. They are expanding at about 16 per cent year on year.In a sector of merchants and marketers not renowned for their technological skills, traditional retailers have more to do to catch up with the way people are shopping.Jonathan Ramsden, chief financial officer at Abercrombie & Fitch, a teen fashion retailer, says the challenge “is being competitive with the pure-play [online-only retailers] and the standards set by Amazon from a shipping and a customer service standpoint”.Abercrombie is closing more than 30 per cent of its US stores, which numbered about 1,000 at their peak, and it wants its website to replace those bricks-and-mortar sales. Its goal is for ecommerce to rise to 25 per cent of total sales; it already makes up 17 per cent.Most retailers agree that the way forward is to be a “multi-channel” or “omnichannel” business. Those buzzwords encapsulate the need to let consumers glide seamlessly between the online and offline businesses, whether they want to do research in a store and then buy on their iPad at home, or receive discount coupons by email and go to a store to redeem them.“Very rarely is a customer purely online or purely bricks-and-mortar,” says Kevin Hofmann, president of online at Home Depot. “You’re bouncing between these different channels.”FT writers dissect the corporate race to turn data into profitFor example, many buyers of Home Depot grills and patio furniture go to a store to get the advice of a shop assistant, but buy on their smartphones there and then so they can get home delivery and avoid carrying the items themselves.Across the sector progress on synchronising the digital and the physical has been mixed, whether it is with advertising, pricing and demand forecasting or customer call centres and deliveries. In a June survey, Retail Systems Research asked retailers whether they were synchronised in 13 different areas and in each one fewer than one in five said yes.Many retailers have been hampered by their first attempt at ecommerce several years ago, when they set up online operations as standalone businesses with separate technology.Since then some of the biggest have sought to buy skills by acquiring tech start-ups. A year ago Home Depot acquired Black Locus, a retail analytics group, and this year Walmart bought four companies – Torbit, Inkiru, OneOps and Tasty Labs – whose software crunches large amounts of data and speeds up websites.To the litany of Christmas day rituals – turkey-chomping, present-unwrapping, family-feuding – it is now time to add a new solemn convention: online shopping.December 25, a day intended for religious observance and quiet contemplation, is fast becoming a day for observing online bargains and contemplating buying them.Continue readingIn October Staples, the stationery chain, bought Runa, whose tools personalise special offers. “We’re not a tech company, so we need to think like a tech company,” says Faisal Masud, executive vice-president of global ecommerce at Staples.Staples is ranked as the US’s second biggest online retailer by the Internet Retailer website as its $10.3bn in online sales globally last year – just over 40 per cent of its total – were second only to those of Amazon, whose total is expected to hit $75bn this year.Popular initiatives include capturing consumers from social media websites such as Facebook and Pinterest, and creating in-store smartphone apps that let shoppers locate what they want, read reviews, and in some cases make a purchase.But retailers are devoting more effort to deliveries, whose speed and reliability have become a key battleground in ecommerce today, due largely to the standard set by Amazon.More retailers are using stores to fulfil online orders, either by letting customers “click-and-collect” from their nearest shop, or by shipping products from shops – as opposed to warehouses – to their homes.Macy’s, a department store chain that is building its fourth ecommerce warehouse, has also turned 500 of its 840 stores into additional shipping facilities, putting counters into store rooms where the employees who stock shelves also pack online orders into boxes.Retailers say such moves are about offering maximum convenience to shoppers, but Sucharita Mulpuru, analyst at Forrester Research, points out that, as shipping costs become painfully high, using stores as mini-warehouses also saves money.Mr Masud at Staples says: “Having stores and online is a huge benefit, but only if you leverage those resources . . . If you don’t have a fully integrated experience, those assets are not utilised.”"

Healthcare was the strongest sector, up 0.3 per cent, while the utilities group was off 1.2 per cent.While US consumers may not have been out repairing their houses, positive earnings from La-Z-Boy showed they were spending that time in a comfortable seat.Shares in the producer of reclining chairs gained 9.8 per cent to $26.82 after the company reported second-quarter revenue of $366m, well above expectations of $17m.Consumers may have enjoyed some leisure time, but they were not doing so consuming jam from JM Smucker, which reported second-quarter earnings and 2014 guidance that missed expectations. Smucker shares were off 6.5 per cent to $101.49.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.3 per cent to 3,921.27, helped by a 2.9 per cent gain from Yahoo to $35.62.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 15,900.82.JC Penney led the gainers on the S&P 500, up 8.4 per cent to $9.44 after the company’s earnings report showed an improvement in same-store sales.The clothing retailer sits 52 per cent lower on the year to date as it looks to recover from a failed attempt by hedge fund activist Bill Ackman to rebrand the company.However, after Mr Ackman sold his stake in JC Penney, other hedge funds have taken positions, according to recent filings.Earnings news also boosted office retailer Staples in early trading, but closed down 1.6 per cent to $15.10 as the company posted a decline in revenue.Another popular target of hedge funds, NQ Mobile, gained 4.1 per cent to $13.92 after the company released guidance that beat expectations.The internet Chinese internet security company was recently the subject of an aggressive short campaign from Muddy Waters.Shares in NQ remain 44 per cent lower in the past month.News that Devon Energy had agreed to buy the oil assets of GeoSouthern Energy for $6bn sent shares higher in morning trading, but closed fractionally lower at $62.75The deal will provide Devon with production of 53,000 barrels of oil a day in addition to 82,000 acres of undrilled land.Groupon extended Tuesday’s sell-off with a 6.1 per cent drop to $9.22, now down 13.9 per cent this week after news emerged that executives had sold a large chunk of shares.The S&P 500 sits 0.9 per cent off its all-time highs touched earlier in the week, which included a brief visit above the 1,800 level.The benchmark index is up 1.9 per cent in the past nine trading sessions, led healthcare and financials – two of the leaders of the 2013 US stock rally.Healthcare is up 2 per cent in the past nine sessions and the best performing sector on the S&P 500, 35.6 per cent higher on the year to date. Financial have added 1.1 per cent and 28.2 per cent in those same time periods.
92;HD;Home Depot;2013-09-04T23:01:29Z;Rush to US debt markets ahead of jobs data and Fed meeting;;Big companies are rushing to the US debt markets this week, trying to lock in borrowing costs at low levels before a possible jump in rates and ahead of important jobs figures and a Federal Reserve meeting.Large corporate borrowers including Starbucks, Home Depot, Caterpillar Financial Services and the UK’s Unilever Capital have tapped the US markets, selling a combined $10bn worth of new securities in a single session, according to Dealogic.The flurry of bond sales came after a slowdown in the past couple of weeks, which brought new debt offerings almost to a halt ahead the US Labor Day holiday. At least another $6bn in debt offerings from companies such as US home-improvement retailer Lowe’s and Nabors Industries, a Bermuda-based land drilling contractor, took place on Wednesday.Corporations are trying to fit in as many bond sales as possible in the days ahead of Friday’s closely watched release of US monthly payrolls data. The Federal Reserve at its meeting later this month may start slowing the pace of its bond-buying programme, sending benchmark interest rates higher.The market for investment-grade dollar bonds, in particular, could be hit by billions of dollars in additional supply.Verizon is expected to raise a portion of the financing for the acquisition of a 45 per cent stake at Verizon Wireless in a blockbuster debt offering that may exceed Apple’s $17bn record sale in April. The company is expected to start marketing the bonds as early as next week.“This month is shaping up as a very busy one,” said Justin D’Ercole, head of the Americas investment grade syndicate at Barclays.“There is a lot that could impact markets and rate-sensitive clients, such as the jobs report, Fed and ECB meetings, and additional supply. It’s not an easy window, but many clients may prefer to come with supply now, rather than try to forecast what the market is going to look like in a couple of weeks.”A combination of record low borrowing costs and strong demand for higher-yielding alternatives to top-tier government bonds have sent sales of dollar-denominated investment grade debt, excluding financials, to $448bn so far this year, according to Dealogic.Since the Fed first indicated it may start slowing down its aggressive stimulus policy in May, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose over 100 basis points to 2.86 per cent on Wednesday.Mr D’Ercole said, depending on how well markets absorbed a slowdown in Fed stimulus, debt sales could jump in the last months of the year. “One thing we know is that interest rates are going to be even higher one year from now. For many companies, this may be a good time to come to markets,” he said.
93;HD;Home Depot;2013-08-22T15:14:48Z;US clothing retail: mall rats;Might the mall store model be in gradual decline?;There is trouble at the mall. Abercrombie & Fitch reported a 10 per cent drop in comparable sales on Thursday. Next door at rival American Eagle Outfitters they fell 7 per cent. In the background, big anchor stores such as JC Penney and Sears continue to struggle mightily.Some stores are going strong. Urban Outfitters reported a 9 per cent jump in comparable sales. But consumers with cash to spend are being very discriminating. They are spending for sturdy home improvements – comparative stores sales at Home Depot and Lowe’s were up 11 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively – rather than flimsy apparel. In addition to weakness at speciality retailers, same-store sales fell at Macy’s department stores. And where they like to buy apparel is changing. Off-price retailers such as TJX – sales up 4 per last quarter, by the way – and Ross Stores, which sell a number of brands, have been growing fast for years.Might the mall store model be in gradual decline? The companies that are on the upswing, Urban Outfitters, J. Crew, Gap, have vibrant online businesses. And according to ShopperTrak, traffic at enclosed malls in the US this year is running about flat to 2012 levels. In spite of a jump right after the financial crisis, mall traffic has been declining since 2000. That is not to say that mass bulldozing of malls is imminent – there were a staggering 8.5bn visits in 2012 – but that the chasm between winners and losers is set to widen.Stock valuations reflect these patterns. Shares of American Eagle and Abercrombie – the latter fell 18 per cent on Thursday – trade at 15 and 13 times forward earnings versus Urban Outfitters at 21 times and TJX at 18. Yet it is the stocks with the low earnings multiples that look expensive. Shoppers are being picky about what, where and how they buy.

94;HD;Home Depot;2013-08-21T18:25:16Z;Lowe’s / Home Depot;Interest rates are a fly in the ointment for US home improvement stocks;"The difference between investing in a home and in shares is that, while both assets tend to appreciate, you don’t have to pay to have your portfolio repainted every few years. A clever investor can even draw wealth from a house’s depreciation – and the need to build new ones – by owning shares in US home improvement stores. Second-quarter results at Lowe’s, reported on Wednesday, included a 10 per cent sales increase. The resulting bump in the shares left them up 130 per cent in two years. This follows a similarly muscular showing by Home Depot.The rally has left both companies trading at 20 times expected earnings for this year – close to 10-year highs. So it is time to assess whether the resurgence in spending on homes in the US has room to run. There is not much data on remodelling and repair spending; but to the degree that home building and buying are a proxy (and another source of demand for Lowe’s and Home Depot), there is information to spare – most of it encouraging. Census data show that housing construction starts are still below their historical norm and the pace of single family home sales, while up from a few years ago, also remains low. This is confirmed by latest data from US estate agents. Prices are still rising at double-digit rates. Home inventories look to have bottomed early this year but remain low.One indicator is going directly in the wrong direction, though: interest rates, which have been jumping during the past six months. This has hit homebuilders’ shares, despite the fact that the relationship between rates and construction is unclear. Toll Brothers, which also reported strong earnings on Wednesday, is off 15 per cent since May. The economic plumbing that connects rates and home improvement spending is complex and indirect. But further sharp rate rises could make anything perceived as housing-related spring a nasty leak.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
95;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Home Depot rides US housing rebound;;Home Depot reported a 17 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings and raised its full year profit outlook as the US home improvement retailer continued to ride the country’s housing market recovery.Relatively low interest rates, an improving labour market and rising home values have encouraged more Americans to buy and sell houses, prompting more home improvement.The Atlanta-based company said net income in the three months to August 4 increased to $1.8bn, or $1.24 a share, from $1.53bn, or $1.01, in the same period a year ago. Sales rose 9.5 per cent to $22.5bn.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.21 a share on revenue of $21.8bn.Cost reduction and improved distribution and merchandising strategies by Frank Blake, chief executive, has helped the company take advantage of the housing market’s rebound.Home Depot said sales at stores open at least a year rose 10.7 per cent – the most since climbing 11 per cent in the second quarter of 1999 – compared with an increase of 2.1 per cent a year earlier. In the US, the increase was 11.4 per cent.Its kitchen, indoor and outdoor garden, lumber, tools, electrical and flooring sales all posted double-digit sales compared with a year earlier.The average purchase rose 4.3 per cent to $57.39 during the quarter.“The second-quarter results exceeded our expectations as our business benefited from a rebound in our seasonal categories, continued strength in the core of the store and the recovering housing market in the US,” Mr Blake said.Home Depot said earnings this year will be about $3.60 a share, up from its previous projection of $3.52.But shares, which have risen 22 per cent in the year to date, remained muted in morning New York trading, up 0.1 per cent at $75.22.Home Depot warned on a company’s earnings conference call that comparisons will get more difficult in the second half of this year as extreme weather, including superstorm Sandy, boosted sales in 2012.Home Depot also said it was keeping an eye on mortgage interest rate rises, which some homebuilders have cited as reasons for a recent pullback in demand for new houses. The company said: “We, like others, are watching the interest rate environment, as consumer spending and mortgage availability could be negatively impacted.”

The Communist party may have dashed the Maoist “ iron rice bowl” to the ground, but Ikea is stepping in to take up the slack.The world’s largest furniture retailer not only invites Chinese consumers to nap on its beds and snack on its dinnerware; it lets pensioners hold matchmaking sessions over free coffee in its canteens, and even provides day care for the only grandchild, to make the whole Eat Drink Man Woman thing go that much more smoothly.And Swedish capitalism can boast something that Chinese communism never quite managed: not just style, quality and low prices but also meatballs. When Ikea opened its new store in a Shanghai suburb last week, a sale on meatballs drew crowds estimated by police at 80,000 a day at the weekend, and provoked at least one patron to pass out, and another to vomit, while queueing on the 41st day of more than 35C heat. But those able to snag a spot in the cattle car-style lifts, or ride the interminable escalators to the start of the traditional Ikea maze, got more than just a smorgasbord. They got the benefits of globalisation, with Chinese characteristics.For Ikea seems to have figured out “glocal”, as it applies to the country – in a way that has eluded foreign retailers such as Best Buy, Home Depot, Media Markt and most recently Tesco (all of whom either bailed on China or gave up on trying to crack the market alone).Pretty much everything in the store looks eerily familiar to any western shopper: I quickly spotted my own bedside table and chest of drawers, and the finger paints my children used as toddlers. But it’s displayed in a way that’s far more Shanghainese than Swedish. It’s like a massive Chinese doll’s house filled with Swedish furniture, and arranged to make the best of mainland property prices.Irrationally exuberant prices for apartments in the gritty northern Baoshan District, where the new store is located, mean local families get by with an average of just 50 sq m to 60 sq m of living space for mum, dad, only child and sometimes grandparents. Newlyweds and young professionals in the area may average no more than 25 sq m for their whole flat.So Ikea set out to show just how much blonde furniture, sleek cabinetry, kitchen gadgetry and computer hardware can be packed into such a real-world doll’s house – and still allow it to appear spacious. And economical: a complete living room for less than Rmb3000 ($490) and kitchens from Rmb1,700 – something even those reaching for the lowest rungs of the middle-class ladder could probably afford.Most of all, however, Ikea wants its 6.5m “neighbours” from Baoshan and the surrounding areas to imagine actually living in these rooms – so it invites them to make themselves at home. Soon there are toddlers jumping on the beds – or tucked up in them reading picture books. Every dining room suite has families clustered around it, some munching snacks they have brought in. “Customers move right into our homes, they nap on our furniture – it’s beautiful, it inspires them,” says one store manager on the day of the opening. The only displays not meant to be interactive, apparently, are the loos: they are closed off with Plexiglas lids that helpfully point out the location of proper toilets. Do Ikea staff ever wake the napping neighbours? “Not unless we need to close the store,” says a manager, adding: “If they don’t buy something this time, they will next time.”This “theme park” atmosphere could not be less like shopping for furniture elsewhere in Shanghai, points out Shaun Rein of China Market Research, a connoisseur of consumerism in the country. Directly across the street at the vast Red Star Macalline mall – which stocks sofas by the city block and beds by the football field – shopping is an altogether more serious business: spending big chunks of capital on big impressive furniture. No wonder the foot traffic is all going to Ikea.Gimmicks such as the free coffee, the matchmaking corner and the napping build a brand the Chinese can love – even if, like consumers the world over, they also love to grouse about how tacky it is. But does good neighbourliness bring big profits? Who knows: Ikea is private, and it isn’t saying. But Best Buy, Home Depot and Tesco are certainly not provoking traffic jams with their new stores in the country. Eat, drink, sleep, love, spend: it seems as likely to work as anything else in China.patti.waldmeir@ft.com"
97;HD;Home Depot;2013-06-26T22:55:34Z;HD Supply prices below expectations;;HD Supply, a former unit of Home Depot acquired by buyout groups at the height of the US housing bubble, has raised $957m from an initial public offering after pricing shares far below its expected range.The company’s private equity backers had looked to raise $1.2bn from an IPO, when valued at the midpoint of a $22-$25 range it set just two weeks ago.However, the company was forced to cut its offer price after meeting limited investor demand at those levels. On Wednesday, it sold 53.2m shares at $18 a piece.During its roadshow, market conditions deteriorated with stock prices falling sharply and volatility on the US market reaching its highest levels since the start of the year.Bain Capital, Carlyle and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice acquired the company for $8.5bn in 2007 before a meltdown in the US housing and commercial property market.Its underwriters pitched the highly levered company as an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to the recovering US property market.The proceeds from the offering will be used to pay down existing debt and pay fees to its private equity backers. It does not intend to pay a dividend. After the deal, HD Supply will carry net debt of roughly $5.5bn.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse led the offering. The company is set to begin trading on Nasdaq under the symbol “HDS” on Thursday.
98;HD;Home Depot;2013-06-13T16:46:32Z;HD Supply files for $1.2bn IPO;;HD Supply, a former unit of Home Depot acquired by buyout groups before the US housing crisis, has filed to raise $1.2bn from an initial public offering.The company is set to be the latest portfolio company held by sponsors, which have been actively unloading shares in a wide range of holdings as stocks trade at record levels, to float on the US market.Private equity backers of the construction supplies company, including Bain Capital, Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, are also looking to capitalise on investor interest in acquiring exposure to the recovering US housing and commercial property sectors.Proceeds from the offering will be used to pay down existing debt and pay fees to sponsors.After the deal, HD Supply will carry net debt of roughly $5.5bn. The company, which operates across North America, had sales of $8bn for the full year to February 3, up 14 per cent compared with the previous period.HD Supply was taken private for $8.5bn in 2007 at the height of the US housing and commercial property boom. Since the crisis, valuations in publicly traded companies in the industrial supplies sector, including WW Grainger and Fastenal, have improved as building activity has picked up.HD Supply is offering 53.2m shares with the aim of pricing them between $22 and $25 and does not plan to pay a dividend. Valued at the midpoint, the offering would raise $1.2bn.A person familiar with the company’s plans said an investor roadshow would travel across the US and Canada before pricing on June 26.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse are leading the offering. The company is expected to list on Nasdaq using the symbol “HDS”.
99;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Best Buy and Home Depot sales contrast;;Stiff competition in the electronics sector led to a decline in US sales at Best Buy, but a healthier US housing market helped Home Depot to report strong revenue growth in the DIY sector.Best Buy shares fell 5.7 per cent to $25.29 after the retailer reported like-for-like US sales that declined 1.1 per cent in the three months to May 4 as Hubert Joly, chief executive, seeks to revive a business that some analysts had written off.Home Depot reported a 4.8 per cent rise in like-for-like sales for the quarter to May 5 as more Americans did work on their homes in spite of the chilling effects of cold weather in the quarter. Its shares rose 2.8 per cent to $78.91.While Home Depot wins praise on Wall Street for its tight management, Mr Joly is grappling with several problems inherited from the previous management as well as fierce competition from Apple, Amazon and Walmart.In spite of US sales that were worse than analysts had expected, Best Buy reported adjusted net income of $97m that exceeded market forecasts, though that excluded a $178m loss from a stake in a European business that it agreed to sell in April and other discontinued operations.Best Buy’s earnings per share of 36 cents, including Europe but excluding restructuring and impairment charges, compared with analysts’ forecasts of 25 cents per share, but was less than half of what the retailer reported a year ago.Mr Joly, who joined the company last August, said that his efforts to revive it were making progress. He cited 16 per cent growth in online sales in the quarter and $135m of cost cuts that followed $150m of cuts in the previous three months.Investor sentiment on Best Buy has begun to turn since Mr Joly launched his initiatives, which include moves to raise store productivity and streamline its supply chain. Its shares had risen by 55 per cent in the three months since the company’s last results, but Tuesday’s results marked a setback.Best Buy said its profits in the next quarter would be squeezed by price cuts and investments in revamping its stores, which are getting new Samsung mini-shops.Home Depot reported net income of $1.2bn, or 83 cents per share, on total sales of $19.1bn, which were up 7.4 per cent from a year ago, beating Wall Street’s top and bottom line expectations.Frank Blake, Home Depot chief executive, said: “[We] saw less favourable weather compared to last year, but we continue to see benefit from a recovering housing market that drove a stronger-than-expected start to the year.”A recovery in the US housing market has gained traction as record low mortgage interest rates and a slowly improving labour market have encouraged more Americans to move house.Additional reporting by Anjli Raval in New York
100;HD;Home Depot;2013-05-07T18:21:50Z;Battle rages over US online tax;;A drive by Walmart and other retailers for the US Congress to end tax-free internet shopping is heading for a collision with Grover Norquist, the anti-tax activist, as both sides compete to sway Republicans over the proposal.The House of Representatives is taking up the Marketplace Fairness Act, which allows states to collect sales tax from online retailers, following its passage in the Senate on Monday night by a bipartisan vote of 69 to 27. But its future in the lower chamber is uncertain.John Boehner, House speaker, told Bloomberg Television he would “probably not” support the online sales tax bill. “Moving this bill where you’ve got 50 different sales tax codes, it’s a mess out there,” Mr Boehner said. “You’re going to make it much more difficult for online retailers to be able to comply.”Retailers who back the proposal, including Walmart, Best Buy, Target, Home Depot, Sears and Amazon.com (which earlier opposed it but switched its position), were able to convince a majority of senators, including Republicans, that the legislation did not represent the introduction of a new tax, even though consumers will see taxes increase as a result of the law when they shop online.It was framed as a “fairness” issue because the legislation gives states the right to collect a sales tax that is already being levied on bricks and mortar shops but not online retailers.But legislators in the House have approached the proposal with more scepticism. “I think this will be stopped in the House,” Mr Norquist, who is influential among the Republican majority, told Fox News recently. “This opens the idea that politicians in Alabama can tax businesses in other states . . . It’s free money, they think.”Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the House judiciary committee, which will have jurisdiction over the proposal and will hold hearings on it, has said he would consider the legislation but that it requires further simplification.In opposing the bill, Mr Norquist, known for his “no tax” pledge that nearly all Republican members of Congress have signed, has emerged as a powerful ally of eBay, the online auction website fighting the legislation. The company has called for a change in the legislation to protect “small businesses” with less than $10m in sales and fewer than 50 employees.“A lot more needs to be done to get the internet sales tax issue right,” said Brian Bieron, eBay’s senior director of global public policy. “Ebay will continue to focus on bringing greater balance to the legislation.”Chris Krueger, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, raised the prospect of the law passing by the end of the year to 40 per cent from 30 per cent before the Senate passed it, given the strong support it received.He said both of the provisions that Ebay is demanding, which would exempt smaller online retailers, would appeal to conservatives who worried that the bill placed onerous regulations on small businesses.“Even with these carve-outs, the bill will face continued hurdles in the House as it is viewed by many as a new tax on the internet,” said Mr Krueger. The bill would enable states to collect the same sales tax from online shoppers that they collect from mall shoppers.The National Retail Federation, which lobbies on behalf of the biggest retailers in the country, hailed the passage of the legislation in the Senate as a “significant step for sales tax fairness”. It had passed despite a “highly funded misinformation campaign by the legislation’s opponents”, the lobby group said.“This bill and its companion in the House will level the playing field for all retailers – both online and off – while safeguarding states’ rights,” said Matthew Shay, NRF president. “And the bill does it all without raising taxes, new government mandates or adding to the deficit.”Sales tax is levied at a state level and ranges from 3 per cent to nearly 8 per cent in different parts of the US. According to a University of Tennessee study, the amount of sales tax that could have been collected from US ecommerce in 2012 was $11.4bn.
101;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Share buybacks bode ill for real economy;Record company buying spree but outcome mixed;Last year, when its stock price was around $20, Jakks Pacific, a designer and marketer of toys, spent about $80m on buying back its shares. It used a mix of its own cash and borrowed funds to do so. Today, the shares are valued at about $11, it has no net cash and its once strong balance sheet is more challenged.For the year ended last April, Navistar International spent $200m buying back its stock at a price of around $40 a share. Then, at the end of October, or seven months later, the company raised $200m in new equity – at $18.75 a share.Home Depot began buying its own shares in 2009 and by 2012 had spent about $9bn on share buybacks. When it began the buybacks, its shares were changing hands at in the mid- $40 level. Today, with 200m fewer shares outstanding, the stock is trading at about $72.American companies spent about $450bn in 2012 buying back their own shares, according to data from Morgan Stanley and indications are that this record will be surpassed this year. Corporate share buyback authorisations for the year through March totalled $208bn, according to Birinyi Associates, the strongest figure since the firm began monitoring the data in 1985.The results, though, have been mixed.Managements almost always love share buybacks given the fact that compensation is often tied to share price performance and the fewer the shares outstanding the more likely the price will rise.But companies don’t always get the timing right. In 2007, many companies were buying back shares at what proved to be peak prices. Then, when the bad times arrived, share prices sank – but many companies could not afford to buy back their shares at the bargain levels.Writing in 2009, Andrew Watts of Oaktree Capital, who has been studying the phenomenon for years, noted that “this questionable practice has become fashionable at just the wrong price and the wrong time in the economic and market cycle. Most buybacks in recent years were a prima facie case of financial mismanagement.”For example, Home Depot now has authorisation to spend $17bn in buybacks, or almost 18 per cent of shares outstanding, according to data from Birinyi Associates, making its programme the largest authorised for the year to date. But the company was not always judicious in its timing in the past. It bought shares in an ambitious programme from 2003 to 2007 at a time when the shares weren’t exactly at bargain levels.It is possible to argue that things are different now than they were back then and that there is good reason for companies to engage in the exercise. For one thing, profit margins are as high as they have ever been yet valuations are still in the “end of equity” zone.At the same time, though, while profits may be at record levels, earnings expectations have been falling and the ratio of negative to positive earnings guidance is at its highest in three years.If earnings per share are rising, it is because there are fewer shares outstanding.It seems easier for corporate management to make an argument in favour of buybacks than in favour of capex. Moreover, buying back shares also sends a message that companies are disinclined to invest in their core business. Nor are they eager to expand by buying the shares of companies other than their own.With its easy money policies, the US Federal Reserve is doubly encouraging of efforts to buy back shares. The Fed is driving people to put money into more risky investments by cutting rates close to zero. It is also making it attractive for companies to use borrowed money and lever up their balance sheets to buy back shares since money is so cheap. Easy money has far more impact on asset prices than on the real economy.The preference for share buybacks over investment into the core business does not bode well for the real economy, and shows that lowering rates does not necessarily help to boost growth.It is especially disconcerting that many of the most active companies are tech groups that often borrow to pay for their programmes, signalling – perhaps inadvertently – that they lack solid growth prospects.Buybacks seem tempting now but they may prove as poor in hindsight as they did in 2007.
102;HD;Home Depot;2013-04-02T20:26:10Z;Sales of US high-grade debt set to pick up;;Sales of US high-grade corporate bonds are expected to pick up in the coming days as borrowers try to squeeze in deals ahead of the start of the US earnings season next week.After a slow start to the second quarter on Easter Monday, with many markets in Europe and Asia closed, global corporate borrowers with strong balance sheets, such as Home Depot, Boston Properties and Kerry Group, returned to debt capital markets on Tuesday with new bond offerings.The combined offers may help push total sales of new debt rated as investment grade up to $20bn by Friday, and to as much as $80bn by the end of the month, according to estimates by RBS.Corporate borrowers will take advantage of a decline in market volatility this week after a scramble over a bailout programme for Cyprus hit global markets at the end of March, analysts said.This week may also offer an opportunity for a handful of US companies to raise funds before they enter the so-called quiet period which precedes earnings reports and limits their activity in capital markets.“There is a need for new supply of investment grade debt. Borrowers are always on the lookout for the best time to come back to markets as volatility has eased and we have earnings starting next week,” said Adrian Miller, a director for fixed income strategy at GMP Securities.“Even though valuations for investment grade bonds have been stretched on secondary markets, the new sales will go smoothly,” he added.Demand for investment grade bonds has remained strong at the start of 2013 even as total returns on the securities have dwindled and US equities rose to record highs. Year-to-date, investors have poured almost $23bn into mutual funds and exchange traded funds that buy investment grade debt. By comparison, funds buying junk bonds saw only $516m in purchases in the same period, while equity funds experienced a $64bn inflow, according to RBS data.Total returns on investment grade bonds are flat so far this year, while junk bonds are showing a 2.9 per cent gain, according to Barclays indices. The S&P 500 stock market index, which closed at record high on Tuesday, is up over 10 per cent. But the bonds are still compelling, in particular among institutional investors, insurers and pension funds which depend on long-term and liquid securities in order to match future liabilities.In addition, analysts said, the Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep benchmark rates low until the unemployment rate drops below 6.5 per cent provides another incentive to hold low-yielding investment grade bonds.“As long as the Fed remains engaged in bond buying, the risk of a dramatic [rise] in yields is small,” said Mr Miller. “Investors know that.”
103;HD;Home Depot;2013-03-07T17:42:30Z;US share buybacks at record amount;;Big US companies bought a record amount of their own shares in February, pushing overall stock purchases above the $1tn mark for the first time since the equity markets started to rebound in 2009.Companies including Home Depot, Time Warner, General Electric and 3M bought back a combined $118bn worth of stock last month, double the amount purchased in the same period of 2012, according to data compiled by Birinyi Associates.The boom comes after companies rushed to buy back shares late in 2012 ahead of changes to US tax laws following fiscal cliff negotiations in Washington, which led to a slow start for repurchases in January.US companies have increasingly relied on buybacks to help lift their share prices as investors shifted their attention to other asset classes, such as corporate bonds.Since 2009, when the US stock market hit a bottom following the financial crisis, companies have bought more than $1tn of their own stock, according to Rosenblatt Securities, and the buybacks are set to pick up pace in 2013.The high volume of buybacks “is a function of companies being flush with cash and forced to do something with it”, said Rob Leiphart, analyst at Birinyi Associates. “Now that the tax laws are changing for dividends, buybacks offer companies the opportunity to deploy capital with the flexibility of adjusting it down the road.”In addition, Mr Leiphart said corporate executives are often given compensation packages based on their companies earnings per share. That in turn provides an incentive for more buybacks.“If all is the same and [executives] are reducing share count, EPS results go up.”Buybacks have helped support a market rally on Wall Street that saw the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting its highest level on record this week. The broad S&P 500 is also approaching an all-time high, having gained 128 per cent since the stock market bottomed in March 2009.“While corporations don’t do much in the way of direct equity investing, they do hold substantial cash piles that can have major implications for the market, specifically in the form of buybacks and M&A,” said Ana Avramovic, a strategist at Credit Suisse.“Buybacks have indeed been picking up steam over the past few years. That, coupled with the fact that the IPO market has been largely dormant since 2008, means that on balance, corporations are sizeable net buyers of stock.”US companies have accumulated high levels cash in the past few years as they have been reluctant to spend on research and development as well as hiring new employees amid uncertain global economic conditions.Additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie
104;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;US retail: shutters are poised;A problem for every bricks-and-mortar retailer is internet retail;Is the US retail industry going to pieces? One might think so, given the goings on at once-healthy store chains from JC Penney (which reported a quarter of record-setting terribleness on Wednesday), Barnes & Noble (store sales flat, digital business floundering, possibly breaking up), Office Depot and Office Max (merging in a last-ditch bid to survive), Best Buy (being slowly bled dry by Amazon), and Sears (shrinking and selling assets).To look at a wider swath of companies is only a bit cheerier. Excluding food, drugs and auto parts, 15 very large store chains (values above $5bn) have reported fourth-quarter results. Of these, only five – Home Depot, Kohl’s, Sears, Cabela’s and Urban Outfitters – reported same-store sales growth that was higher than in the same quarter last year. And one might note that of the five that saw acceleration, Sears was comparing to an abysmal 2011 and Home Depot is benefiting from the housing bounce. At Cabela’s, a sporting goods supplier, same store sales were “aided by a surge in firearms and ammunition” which, hopefully, will not be repeated.The macroeconomic data don’t provide much joy, either. Total US retail sales growth (excluding cars, gas and food) hit a cyclical peak at about 6.5 per cent in the spring of last year and has trended down to about 4.5 per cent since, according to Census Bureau data. Looking over a longer period, the growth trend is negative: cyclical peaks in growth have inched lower since the mid-90s.A problem for every bricks-and-mortar retailer is internet retail, which went from $45bn to $225bn, or more than 6 per cent of all US retail, between 2002 and 2012. Meanwhile, data from CoStar Realty show that during that decade US retail space grew 13 per cent, or about 1.9bn sq ft. Traditional retailers are hurting. A lot of stores will have to be shuttered before the pain stops.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
105;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Wall St rises on positive housing data;;US stocks rose on Tuesday with investors bidding up shares in Home Depot and other companies tied to the country’s recovering housing sector.Overall, the S&P 500 climbed 0.6 per cent to 1,496.94 in New York, finishing near a session high after a steady rally that began just after midday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 13,900.13 as the blue chip measure outperformed the other major US benchmarks and was led higher by a jump in Home Depot shares.The home improvement company reported that growth in the US housing market had helped boost fourth-quarter sales.Home Depot, which raised its estimates for net income and sales for this year as it cited a pick-up in the sector, also increased its quarterly dividend by 34 per cent to 39 cents. Shares in the Home Depot were 5.7 per cent higher to $67.56 and were among the best performing on the broader market.Rival Lowe’s, which reported its results earlier in the week, joined in the gains and rose 2 per cent to $36.59.Encouraging housing market data also bolstered investors in the sector, sending the nation’s largest public homebuilders higher on the day.Separate reports showed that home prices in 20 large metropolitan regions of the country rose in December while new home sales reached their highest level since 2008 in January.Homebuilder Lennar Corp gained 3.7 per cent to $38.01 and DR Horton climbed 4.1 per cent to $22.25.The gains from across the sector helped the overall market pare some of its losses from Monday when nervousness over the outcome of the Italian parliamentary elections sparked the worst single-day sell-off for stocks since November.All 10 main industry measures on the benchmark were higher with defensive telecommunications performing strongly among the sector groups. AT&T shares were 0.9 per cent higher at $35.49.Financial sector stocks, which suffered the biggest losses on Monday, gained 0.5 per cent.Shares in JPMorgan Chase, the Wall Street bank that said on Tuesday it would cut 17,000 jobs over two years, dropped 0.2 per cent to $47.60. Meanwhile, Bank of America rose 0.9 per cent to $11.13.Wall Street’s fear gauge, as measured by the CBOE Vix index, also calmed after rocketing higher on Monday during the selling. The index, which tracks implied volatility on the S&P 500, fell 11.7 per cent to 16.8.Fears among some equity investors that the Federal Reserve may imminently slow its asset purchases also eased as Ben Bernanke testified in support of continued central bank’s stimulus measures at a congressional hearing.The Nasdaq Composite index finished 0.4 per cent to 3,129.65. Shares in Apple, which have lost 15.7 per cent since the start of the year, rose 1.4 per cent to $448.90 after earlier touching its lowest intraday level in 12 months.Consumer discretionary stocks were also among the best performing industry groups on the day and rose 1 per cent behind optimistic earnings’ forecasts by companies in the sector.Macy’s, the department store chain, jumped 2.8 per cent to $39.59 after it said net profits for the holiday quarter beat expectations and raised its outlook for 2013 earnings.Saks, the high-end department store group, gained 1.6 per cent to $11.22 after it also increased net income estimates for the year.Other economic data showed that US consumer confidence ticked higher in February, further bolstering the related S&P sector.But electronics retailer Best Buy fell 3.2 per cent to $16.46 as it said 400 jobs at the company’s headquarters had been cut.
106;HD;Home Depot;2013-02-10T00:12:02Z;Cold comfort for Valentine’s gift retailers;Snow disrupts peak shopping period for stores;Shopping came to a snowbound halt in parts of the US northeast on the weekend as a fierce blizzard disrupted the peak shopping period of the week for retailers and the biggest buying opportunity for Valentine’s gifts.Stores and malls across Massachusetts and Connecticut stayed shut on Saturday as the states imposed travel bans, while in parts of Long Island many residents chose to avoid slippery roads even where shops were open.Walmart – whose Valentine’s day gift selection includes stuffed animals, chocolates and lingerie – had as many as 132 stores closed due to the travel bans on Saturday. By 5pm eastern time, 58 stores remained shut.Retailers on Long Island were “having some trouble” said Ted Potrikus, executive vice-president of the Retail Council of New York State, a trade group.“Their numbers today are certainly going to be slower and lower simply because people don’t want to go out unless they absolutely have to. It’s good for the officials who need to clear the roads, but awful for retailers.”He said the loss of Valentine’s day shoppers was a particular concern for small gift stores, which had reason to worry that customers would opt to buy online instead.“If people can’t get out, where do they go now? They go to the computer. If I’m an enterprising guy who doesn’t feel like going out in snow, I’m going to gamble that the weather will clear enough for the UPS guy to make it to my sweetheart in time.”Roosevelt Field, a giant Long Island mall, opened later than usual at midday on Saturday, while an employee who answered the telephone at Macy’s said she did not see a lot of shoppers. But a staff member at Gap said: “It’s kind of busy considering what happened yesterday.”In Massachusetts, including the state capital of Boston, retail activity had been “very limited” until 4pm on Saturday, when the travel ban was lifted, said Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts.“Certainly gas stations were allowed to be open, and pharmacies and convenience stores, primarily to service some of the emergency personnel and snow plough people,” he said. “But by and large everyone abided by the governor’s directive.”Store employees who needed to get to work to reopen after 4pm on Saturday had been exempted from the ban, he said. Although roads had been cleared, however, many consumers would remain stranded because of the continued closure of public transport systems.Many hardware stores were exempt from the travel ban also, but Home Depot said a “few dozen” of its stores were closed on Saturday morning because “[the snow] was just so deep they couldn’t open”. By late afternoon only one was still shut.As shopper numbers began to rise in the afternoon and evening, the company said it was seeing strong demand for power generators, batteries and shovels.In Danbury, Connecticut, the Danbury Fair mall remained closed throughout Saturday, but an employee said it would reopen on Sunday: “Absolutely . . . The roads are clear. I don’t think there’s any problem.”Even though Connecticut’s travel ban was lifted at 4pm on Saturday, Joe Wrinn, a real estate agent with Goodfellow Ashmore, remained stranded in the small town of Oxford, where roads were closed until midday Sunday.“I’m not consuming anything today other than what I have,” he said. But he had not joined the panic buyers who had stocked up on emergency provisions on Friday.“They almost think it’s Armageddon. Maybe they want to feel that way. It’s fun to hunker down . . . But I suspect by Monday we’ll be back to normal.”
107;HD;Home Depot;2013-01-17T13:28:04Z;Foreign brands tread new paths in China;;Daimler is to peddle its Smart cars through the Chinese equivalent of Twitter while Apple will sell iPhones on an instalment plan: both signs that foreign retailers in China are scrambling for new ways to entice mainland consumers who are no longer such a pushover for foreign products.Gone are the days when just setting up a shop on a Chinese high street was enough to guarantee a steady stream of sales for foreign brands – as Germany’s Metro learned this week when it confirmed the failure of its experiment in electronics retailing in Shanghai. Metro said it would abandon its plan to establish more than 100 Media Markt electronics stores in China by mid-decade.Germany’s largest listed retailer joins an illustrious line of famous western brands that have failed to prosper in China, including Best Buy, Home Depot (the US do it yourself chain) and Barbie. Even brands that have long been recognised as experts at exploiting the Chinese market – such as Yum Brands, owner of KFC, the largest foreign restaurateur in China – have recently begun to stumble.“Until recently in China…if you had stuff to sell the demand was so overwhelming that you did not need a competitive product. But today we are facing a very different consumer, she is more sophisticated, she is taking her time to weigh her options, the consumer is not shopping in a way that is comparable with a year ago,” says Jacques Roizen, of Alvarez and Marsal, the turnround specialists, in Hong Kong.“The challenge is what happens when the music stops: unsustainable growth is no longer masking all the sins” of foreign retailers, he says.Beijing is set to release GDP data on Friday showing the Chinese economy expanded by about 7.7 per cent last year, the slowest pace since 1999.For Apple, which is battling a loss of market share to cheaper brands in China, the answer is to allow Chinese consumers to buy its gadgets on credit– a move that could help boost sales in the world’s largest smartphone market.Meanwhile at Daimler, which has enjoyed many years of double-digit sales growth in China, growth dipped to 4 per cent last year, well behind luxury rivals BMW and Audi.Now Daimler is set to become the first carmaker to sell cars on Sina Weibo, China’s largest micro-blogging site. It will sell a limited Chinese New Year edition of the Smart city car, sales of which rose 45 per cent last year on the mainland.Sina Weibo has more than 368m registered users, according to the company, although only a fraction of those are believed to be active. China’s microblogs have been commercialising quickly, becoming a medium for companies to build their image, advertise their products, take orders and offer customer service. Sina has been expanding functions that allow companies to make the microblog a commercial tool.

Sears Holdings’ valuation says he does. The company’s market capitalisation is about $4.2bn. As of the end of the third quarter, it had net debt of $3.3bn. Assuming debt came down by $1bn in the fourth quarter (always a cash bonanza for retailers), Sears’ enterprise value sits near $6.5bn. Optimists foresee $600m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in 2013 – rendering an EV/ebitda multiple of 11. Yes, that is what go-go stock Home Depot fetches. But Home Depot does not have steadily falling same-store sales; it does not burn cash; it does not underinvest in its stores. Sears does all three. Its future earnings are not worth $6.5bn.That leads us to Mr Lampert, chairman, majority shareholder (through his ESL Investments) and – as of next month – chief executive. Outgoing chief Louis D’Ambrosio stepped down on Tuesday. Mr Lampert has already spun various bits and pieces out of Sears: a big stake in Sears Canada, the Sears Hometown and Orchard Supply chains, some real estate.The bet is that more real estate, and brands such Craftsman tools, Lands’ End clothing and Kenmore appliances can be sold for more than the enterprise value plus the company’s $2bn pension obligation, and the cost of breaking leases on stores in bad locations. That may be. ISI research has argued that under ideal conditions the brands and real estate could fetch more than $9bn (a forced liquidation cuts that in half). But, as Credit Suisse has pointed out, despite positive ebitda, the pension contributions, interest payments and capital expenditure mean it will burn about $500m in cash – $4 to $5 a share – this year. So unless Sears’ assets are becoming more valuable, the company is getting less valuable at a good clip. We’d like to see that trick now, Mr Lampert.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
109;HD;Home Depot;2013-01-04T19:07:25Z;Biden faces key role in second term;;When Joseph Biden was taking new senators through a practice run of their swearing-in ceremony this week, doubtless one of the most adrenalin-inducing experiences of their lives, the vice-president could not help but crack a string of jokes.“This guy looks like he still plays for South Carolina,” Mr Biden, who served 36 years in the Senate, said of Tim Scott, the newly appointed Republican senator for South Carolina, as he met the former football player and his family in the hallowed chamber this week. “Need any help on your pecs, man, give me a call,” said the 70-year-old Mr Biden.Upon being shown video of his father uttering some earthier phrases to the husband of incoming Democrat Heidi Heitkamp, Beau Biden said: “He’s the same person at home, at Home Depot and in Congress.”Indeed, this is vintage Biden – the down-to-earth blue-collar Joe who puts people at ease in even the most formal of settings, but who can never be relied upon to keep his foot out of his mouth.After four years as President Barack Obama’s deputy, a revitalised Mr Biden is set to play an increasingly prominent role in the administration’s second term.“Biden is becoming a very important player not just because he knows the Senate and senators trust him, but because Obama has a very strong relationship with him,” said Norman Ornstein, a veteran political analyst who has known the vice-president for decades.Mr Biden’s long experience in the Senate – stretching back to the time when “bipartisan” was not a slanderous term – has made him Mr Obama’s go-to guy when he needs someone to bang heads together on Capitol Hill.During their first term, Mr Biden was called in to help broker deals on the contentious healthcare reforms – which he had initially advised Mr Obama against pushing – and extending the Bush-era tax cuts in 2010.During a presidential debate in 2007, Joseph Biden was asked to respond to a member of the public who posed a question on gun control while brandishing a semi-automatic gun. “This is my baby,” the questioner said of his rifle. “I tell you what, if that’s his baby, he needs help,” the Democratic candidate replied.Mr Biden, a six-time Delaware senator, has been an advocate of greater gun controls for more than 30 years.In 1984, he helped pass the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which included provisions for longer prison sentences for repeat offenders who used firearms in their crimes – although a ban on assault weapons he wrote around the same time failed in Congress.In 1994, Mr Biden helped push through the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which became known as the Biden Crime Law and included a ban on assault weapons written by Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California.Mr Biden was reportedly worried the inclusion of the ban would scupper the crime bill but fought for its inclusion, and won. But that demanded compromise. By the time it was enacted by President Bill Clinton after six years of wrangling, the law defined an assault weapon as a rifle that could take a magazine and two add-ons such as a bayonet lug or grenade launcher – guns with none or one of these remained legal.The law also banned magazines of more than 10 rounds and manufacture of 19 types of semi-automatic firearms, but any made before 1994 were exempt.The bill, which had a “sunset clause” of 10 years, was allowed to elapse in 2004 by the then Republican-led Congress.Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat, and Mark Kirk, a Republican of Illinois, tried to reinstate the ban, to no avail.As the US teetered on the edge of the fiscal precipice last week, it was Mr Biden who was dispatched to the Hill to work out a deal with Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, after majority leader Harry Reid’s efforts came to nothing.“The vice-president and I have worked together on solutions before, and I believe we can again,” Mr McConnell said.Analysts say that this McConnell-Biden arrangement is likely to become the cornerstone of dealmaking over the net few years.After the deal was passed by the House, Mr Biden stood at Mr Obama’s side in the White House close to midnight as the president said: “I want to thank the work that was done by my extraordinary vice-president Joe Biden.”During their first term, Mr Biden’s main areas of responsibility in the White House were Iraq and the Recovery Act, both of which have now come to an end.In their second term, Mr Biden can be expected to take on a leading – if somewhat behind the scenes – role pushing the president’s ambitious legislative agenda.First up is gun control, one of the most politically sensitive issues around. Mr Obama has appointed his vice-president head of a task force to look for ways to avoid recurrences of last month’s Sandy Hook school killings.Mr Biden, after six years of work, shepherded a gun control bill through the Senate in 1994, and refused to yield to Republican pressure when an assault weapon ban was tacked on to it.He has already started pushing for the president’s other top legislative priority – comprehensive immigration reform.“In one sense, we have a long way to go, bringing 11 million Hispanics out of the shadows and into the light of day,” Mr Biden told Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute this week. “What’s different today is that the rest of the nation, the rest of America, recognises it’s time. It’s your time.”The role that Mr Biden will play over the next year will be a chance for him to overcome perceptions that he is not just easy-going, but is an “amiable buffoon”.Countering such perceptions will be important because Mr Biden has not ruled out making another run for the presidency in 2016.Although he will be 74 by then, he is in good shape and works out in the House gym regularly.His performances of the last week stand in stark contrast to photos of the other top candidate for the Democratic nomination in 2016 – Hillary Clinton.A tired looking Mrs Clinton left a New York hospital this week after undergoing treatment for a blood clot in her head. (Mr Biden suffered two brain aneurysms in the late 1980s.)But Mrs Clinton still has plenty of time to rebound.“If Hillary recharges her batteries and does some remarkable things around the world for women, as expected,” said Mr Ornstein, “she will be very hard to take on, let alone beat.”

The index rose 1.3 per cent during Friday’s shorter trading session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 per cent to 13,009.68 and gained 3.3 per cent over the past week.But investors should be cautious in their views regarding a fiscal cliff deal, said Brian Gardner, senior vice-president at Washington Research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.“We continue to believe that there will be a deal (probably in mid-December), but we also believe that negotiations will hit occasional bumps and the principals will dig in their heels from time to time, which could produce headlines that spook investors.“We think investors should avoid getting too complacent about what lies between a deal and where we are today.”Retailers were in the spotlight on the day after Thanksgiving – commonly known as Black Friday, so named as most companies in the sector “enter the black” or become profitable for the year.The S&P consumer discretionary index, which includes most of the retailers, climbed 5.1 per cent for the week.Shares in Walmart rose 1.9 per cent to $70.20 after the retailer said it processed nearly 10m register transactions and almost 5,000 items a second on Thursday evening when its doors opened. The stock clocked in a 3.2 per cent weekly gain.Shares in Macy’s advanced 1.8 per cent to $41.73, having risen 3.9 per cent over the week. Target rose 1.2 per cent to $64.48 and was 3.2 per cent higher on the week.“Capital markets will be watching the upcoming Black Friday and Cyber Money results from large retailers as a proxy for the health of the US consumer,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group.He said expectations for holiday season sales is running 3.4 per cent above 2011 with Black Friday pegged to rise at least 5 per cent over last year. Heading into Thanksgiving, the S&P retail index of 32 companies, led by Home Depot, Amazon and Target, had rallied 28.1 per cent this year – more than double the 12 per cent rise in the broader market.Technology stocks were the best performers on Friday, reversing the six-week losing streak on the Nasdaq Composite. The tech-heavy benchmark gained 4 per cent on the week.Apple shares were set for their best weekly gain in eight months after slumping more than 25 per cent from its all-time high reached in mid-September.Investors began shunning the stock after disappointing third-quarter results, sending it into a bear market. The stock rose 1.7 per cent to $571.50 by the close and added 8.3 per cent over the week.Internet coupon company Groupon was a big winner, rising for seven consecutive days and gaining 32.5 per cent over the week to $3.95. The stock rose 1.8 per cent on Friday.Research In Motion shares rallied 13.6 per cent to $11.66 and added 26.7 per cent to the BlackBerry maker’s market value over the week.Friday’s gains for some technology stock limited their weekly setbacks. Hewlett-Packard suffered heavy losses on Tuesday when the PC maker announced a $8.8bn write-off on the value of its $11bn Autonomy acquisition.Shares in HP, which tumbled 12 per cent after the announcement, regained some ground during the subsequent session. They rose 4.2 per cent to $12.44 and weekly losses were pared to 3.2 per cent.Intel shares took a hit over the past week after the company on Monday announced that Paul Otellini, chief executive, would retire in May, leaving no clear successor in place for the first time in its history.Its shares rose 1.9 per cent to $19.72 on Friday but were down 2.3 per cent on the week.Financial stocks that had sold off since President Barack Obama was re-elected attracted buyers over the past week and especially on Friday.Bank of America had weekly gains of 8.5 per cent to $9.90 and JPMorgan Chase, added 3.9 per cent to $41.09. Wells Fargo rose 3.9 per cent to $33.20 while investment bank Goldman Sachs gained 3.8 per cent to $120.31.Some energy stocks, notably refiners, rose following a spike in oil prices as violence erupted in the Gaza Strip and Israel.Though oil prices eased after a ceasefire was announced on Wednesday, refiners held on to gains.In the past five days, Tesoro Corp gained 10.1 per cent to $41.92, Valero Energy Corp added 8.7 per cent to $31.92 and Western Refining rose 14 per cent to $28.60.Positive housing data earlier in the week lifted homebuilder stocks. PulteGroup added 8.6 per cent to $17.03 and Lennar Corp gained 7 per cent to $38.68 over the past week.
111;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Sandy diverts Black Friday shoppers;;"The tins of Kilz Premium stain blocker in Joe Solimeo’s shopping cart should stop any blemishes from creeping through the walls of his second house in Staten Island, which is home to his elderly parents-in-law.But for now there are no in-laws at the duplex in a low-lying south shore neighbourhood and no internal walls either. “I mean, there’s nothing,” he says, recounting the devastation caused by the surge of seawater that superstorm Sandy brought.In a week when Americans celebrate Thanksgiving and retailers uncork Black Friday discounts to launch the Christmas shopping season, thousands of storm victims such as Mr Solimeo are still cleaning up or looking toward the daunting task of rebuilding.His local Home Depot store is one place where the jingle of the holiday season intersects with the hard slog of responding to a disaster that killed 23 people in Staten Island, where 12,000 homes sit in areas that had at least 3ft of water.The retailer, which had sales of $70bn last year, has even ceded part of its car park to the American Red Cross, whose volunteers are delivering hot meals to people in the disaster zone.Inside the store, the high-visibility shelves at the ends of aisles are not stocked with decorations or gifts such as tools sets – as in other years – but with post-storm essentials including trash bags and circuit breaker switches for electrical panels.A large inflatable Father Christmas looks down on a table of poinsettias at one side of the entrance; on the other the shelves carry bottles of super-strength OdoBan cleaning fluid needed to eliminate mustiness and mould, a festering menace to flood victims.While coastal parts of Staten Island suffered as much storm damage as anywhere, a significant number of the island’s 470,000 residents – many Italian-American, many emergency service workers – are entering the holidays unscathed.Julie Osterhoudt, Home Depot’s store manager, says: “We’re not promoting holiday as much to find that balance between these two needs in the community.“Normally this store would be decorated to the nines with candy canes made from PVC pipes and blow-up dolls hanging from the ceiling, but I’m not going that extra step.”Black Friday is when chilly shoppers traditionally queue up outside stores for “door buster” bargains and this year Walmart, Target, Toys R Us and Sears were due to jump the gun and open earlier than ever on Thanksgiving night.Order Barney Jopson’s startling account of the hidden influence and boundless ambition of Amazon, overlord of a mini-economy that goes well beyond online shoppersAnalysts expect sales to grow moderately but by less than the 6.6 per cent ShopperTrak recorded last year. An Accenture survey found an increase in the number of people planning to shop but the National Retail Federation recorded a fall.In Sandy-affected areas consumers are likely to divert money from Christmas to rebuilding and replacing furniture, ovens and fridges, though some are finding their insurance covered less than they thought.Ms Osterhoudt says the change has not necessarily created a big uptick in sales at her store. At a national level it’s not certain whether such a shift will boost or depress spending over the full length of the holiday season, when the NRF has forecast a 4.1 per cent rise in sales.Black Friday bargains are the last thing on the mind of Mr Solimeo, a retired IT recruiter wearing a Fire Department of New York fleece from one of his sons, who says he is already on his fourth or fifth trip to Home Depot since the storm.“I’m out buying necessities,” he says. “I’m out here doing the job. Friday’s going to be a big day. The hot water, heating and air conditioning [systems] are coming in Friday.”Storm waters filled the basement of his house in Midland Beach like a punch bowl and rose two to three feet on the ground floor, soaking the structure with the waste-filled effluent of the Atlantic.He had no choice but to strip it down to bare columns and beams, piling up personal possessions for sanitation workers to take away. His parents-in-law have been evacuated to a son’s home in New Jersey while everyone waits for the house to dry.The storm has temporarily rid Staten Island of its status as New York’s forgotten borough, an anomalous zone of car-owning, yard-proud, early-to-bed suburbia within the borders of the city that never sleeps. But its large, freestanding homes meant people had more to lose than Manhattan apartment-dwellers.Ralph Branca, chief executive of Victory State Bank, a Staten Island lender, is helping co-ordinate an effort by local businesses to encourage dazed storm victims to test for mould before rebuilding, and to use only licensed contractors.“It’s like a battlefield. People are still traumatised. It’s very difficult for people to make informed decisions,” he said, adding that some rogue traders were charging $7,000 to pump water out of basements when it should only cost about $1,500.Sandy’s impact was capricious but businesses did not escape. While an unharmed ShopRite supermarket in New Dorp was selling Thanksgiving turkeys this week, a washed-out Staples a few blocks up had binned its inventory and been gutted.“The smaller businesses don’t know if they’re going to be able to reopen,” says Mr Branca. “That all depends on the insurance proceeds. If you take a $500,000 loss on a small business that can push you over the edge.”In previous years, like other Americans, Staten Islanders have formed night-time queues outside their local Macy’s or Best Buy to grab the best Black Friday deals. But this year Mr Branca guessed it would be more muted.“You’re choosing between cleaning your house, wondering where you’re going to get your next meal . . . or standing in line to get a flatscreen TV? But sometimes it’s hard to know. People need a diversion.”Mr Solimeo won’t necessarily be at Home Depot when it opens at 5am on Black Friday, but he’s already spent nearly $10,000 there since Sandy and has applied for a loan for more funds.“I still gotta get cabinets, flooring,” he says, inching his cart towards the car park. “I’ll be back. We’re not done.”"

Shares in the retailer added 3.6 per cent to $63.38 and gained more than 50 per cent year to date.Analysts at Citi Research reiterated their “buy” rating and said: “We see a clear organic runway through market share gains and capitalising on improving trends while maintaining expense discipline.“Furthermore, the company is signalling its belief in the business through more aggressive share buybacks and investments in technology enhancements.”Homebuilders initially benefited from Home Depot’s positive outlook but by the end of the trading reversed gains and closed lower.Shares in DR Horton initially rose but closed 0.7 per cent lower at $19.25. The biggest US homebuilder by annual closings reported better than expected quarterly profit after market close on Monday. Net sales rose 21 per cent on low mortgage rates and falling inventories. PulteGroup shares also rose initially, but reversed gains to close 0.5 per cent lower at $16.17.Overall, US equities failed to hang on to modest gains and closed down near multi-month lows.Caution and fear took over, as the negotiations over the budget deal and the looming fiscal cliff, weighed on investor sentiment.“Markets are looking for good news or optimism that the fiscal cliff will be averted,” said Channing Smith, equity strategist at Capital Advisors.“However, most investors fear that might not be the case. They are also overwhelmingly trying to lock in profits, as they believe that taxes on capital gains and dividends will rise now that Barack Obama has been re-elected as president,” Mr Smith added.The S&P 500 index started the trading day lower but reversed losses and traded most of the day in positive territory, but selling during the last hour brought the index down. The benchmark closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,376.05.The index also breached a psychologically significant level, falling below its 200-day moving average. Most technical analysts believe that would lead to further downward trend.Technology and financials sectors were leading the losses, while utilities and consumer discretionary stocks managed to retain modest gains.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index edged down 0.7 per cent to 2,883.89.Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, fluctuated throughout the day but closed fractionally lower at $542.59. The stock is still more than 20 per cent below its peak reached in mid-September.Microsoft shares lost 3 per cent to $27.10 after Monday’s news that Steven Sinofsky, the head of Windows, had abruptly left the company after 23 years at Microsoft. Mr Sinofsky oversaw the launch of the Windows 8 software but has been criticised for his abrasive management style. He will be replaced by Julie Larson-Green.Analysts at Nomura remained positive about the stock and retained their “buy” rating saying they did not “think the move is a reflection on the success of Windows 8 one month after its release”.Shares in Google fell 1.1 per cent to $658.83, while Oracle lost 1 per cent to $29.99.Cisco Systems closed virtually flat, but stock prices jumped 6.8 per cent to $18.00 in after-hours trading after the company reported solid earnings and surprised Wall Street analysts.Among financials, JPMorgan shares sold off, down 1.3 per cent to $40.04, while Wells Fargo lost 1.5 per cent to $32.02.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent to 12,756.18.MetroPCS jumped as high as 3 per cent but pared gain to trade 1.1 per cent higher to $10.16 amid high volumes. The stock is also one of the most heavily shorted on the S&P 500 index and Tuesday’s jump may be due to covering of a large short position.Among energy companies, Southwestern Energy Company saw its shares rise 3.4 per cent to $35.10.In other earnings news, TJX, which operates discount apparel retail stores such as TJMaxx and Marshalls, reported third-quarter earnings that beat estimates and raised its full-year profit guidance. Shares in the retailer rose 2.7 per cent to $42.06.Xerox shares rose 1.4 per cent to $6.42 after the provider of printers and business services announced a dividend increase and an additional $1bn boost to its share buyback programme at the company’s investor conference.

113;HD;Home Depot;2012-11-06T17:28:00Z;Don’t wait to strike out on your own;I have never regretted leaving the phoney safety of a steady job;"There is no formula to follow when you decide to become your own boss: every entrepreneur’s journey is different.For example, Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank, founders of Home Depot, were fuelled by their sense of injustice. They had run a DIY chain called Handy Dan, but were summarily fired by their boss, Sandford Sigoloff – who resented their success as retailers. Both were in their late 40s, neither had much saved and suddenly they were unemployed.They determined that they were not going to work for anyone else again. They used their desire for revenge to create a business model that would crush their old company. And thus Handy Dan disappeared – while today Home Depot enjoys revenues of $70bn.I moonlighted with various modest ventures for a number of years in my early 20s while holding down full-time jobs before I took the plunge. When the stockbroking firm where I worked sent round a memo saying staff had to resign all outside directorships, I knew it was make or break time.Once I left I felt a huge sense of relief. I never understand why more people don’t do it. As entrepreneur Daniel Gulati says: “The real barrier for most of us is not external. It’s our own psychology: we overthink decisions, fear eventual failure, and prioritise near-term, visible rewards over long-range success.”Trying ideas part-time during weekends, holidays and evenings by moonlighting can be an excellent rehearsal. Moreover, in the digital age it is much easier to test prototypes while retaining a full-time salaried position. But investors, staff, suppliers and customers will all want full commitment – and it is only when you have everything to lose that the crucial reserves of energy and persistence start to flow.The crossover moment at which you make your move into self-employment is hard to predict. It may be when you have accumulated enough savings to sustain yourself for a while without an income. It could be the moment you secure a real customer for your new offering. Perhaps your employer turns down a concept that you know could be a hit, and you leave to pursue it. It might be that the right business partner promises to take the leap too. Or possibly you have become so bored in your day job, and so excited by your private venture, that you can no longer live with yourself unless you give it a go.Certain lucky managers have the opportunity to buy their business thrust upon them. I always encourage anyone in that position to stretch every sinew to seize the chance. Often these companies are the unloved subsidiaries of large groups, which can be bought relatively cheaply and improved with focus and passion. Usually the management will be offeredgenerous equity in the buyout. It is remarkable how ownership and freedom from corporate hierarchy can unleash strong performance in an operation. Such transactions are really the genesis of the modern private equity industry.As with most vital decisions, no one should wait for the perfect moment to launch their entrepreneurial career. That is simply an excuse for procrastination. Instead, do as much preparation as possible, follow your instincts – and when you walk out, don’t look back.Despite all my many mistakes and flops, I have never regretted leaving the phoney safety of a steady job. God forbid decades later one should still endure the same daily commute, taking orders from grey nonentities, a semi-helpless victim of office politics and stifling bureaucracy. Better by far the perils and rewards of an independent life, free to win or lose through one’s own striving.My sense is that the present cohort of graduates and twentysomethings is far braver than I was. The entrepreneurial culture has never been more lively, and I am confident that in the coming years there will be hundreds of brilliant new enterprises led by this generation of risk-takers, who opt to control their own destiny. Some may be starting a company because they have little choice, since the alternatives are bleak. But such a step could well prove providential.I leave the final words on the subject to the poet W.H. Auden:We would rather be ruined than changed,
We would rather die in our dread,
Than climb the cross of the moment,
And let our illusions die.lukej@riskcapitalpartners.co.ukThe writer runs Risk Capital Partners, a private equity firm, and is chairman of StartUp Britain"
114;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Sandy set to distort US spending;;Hurricane Sandy’s impact is likely to distort spending patterns on the US east coast as the end-of-year shopping season begins, analysts said, while retailers reported better than forecast October sales growth.With damage assessment continuing and clean-up work beginning slowly, Tom Clarke, a director in the retail practice at AlixPartners, said some households would probably end up spending less on luxuries ahead of Christmas.“You’ll see a shift in spending. Folks will take discretionary income and funnel it to rebuilding and re-establishing the basics, and away from fashion and accessory items, more whimsical purchases,” he said.Home Depot and Lowe’s, two home improvement retailers that consumers will turn to for building materials and white goods, had positioned supplies in advance of the storm so they could quickly replenish stores along its path.November is a crucial month for retailers with the biggest shopping day, Black Friday, coming on the day after Thanksgiving.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, a research group, said storm disruption was likely to reduce national retail sales growth in November by 1 to 2 percentage points.However, retailers that reported monthly sales figures for October Thursday made scant reference to the storm.Like-for-like sales excluding drug stores rose 4.7 per cent from the same month last year, according to Thomson Reuters, better than the consensus forecast of a 4.3 per cent rise.Although sales at Target, the mass market discounter, fell short of expectations, the numbers overall continued a pattern of strong consumer spending that has defied persistent economic uncertainty.“The expectation was that many retailers were going to come out and use the storm as an excuse to clear the decks in terms of [sales] expectations and nobody did that,” said Stacey Widlitz of SW Retail Advisors. “I think most retailers don’t know the true impact of the storm yet.”Some retailers are likely to be left with some excess holiday inventory, which could result in price markdowns that are good for shoppers but bad for profitability.However, Macy’s, which reopened its Manhattan flagship store on Wednesday, raised its forecast for sales growth in the second half of 2012 Thursday to about 4 per cent from 3.7 per cent.But he added: “The plans for supporting holiday [sales] were far enough along. Most folks are not waiting for a lot of merchandise to still get here from overseas.”
115;HD;Home Depot;2012-10-26T18:04:02Z;92, but not out;Older workers should not be stumped by unfair age limits;Politicians fretting about how to fund crippled pension systems want people to stay in work well beyond the age of 65. But Charlie Fenton is proof that the odds are stacked against the older worker.Britain’s longest-serving cricket umpire has been bowled out of a 61-year career because an insurance company judged him too risky to cover at the age of 92. Yet Mr Fenton is fitter than many younger rivals. He does not wear glasses, has no hearing aid and can stand for seven hours straight. How many of the developed world’s increasingly obese younger generation can do the same?Artificial age barriers are largely irrelevant now that growing old does not have to mean disability and frailty. Buster Martin was still washing vans for a plumbing company at the impressive age of 104. Last month Rose Syracuse retired at 92 after 73 years working at New York’s famous department store, Macy’s. And at 102, psychologist Hedda Bolgar was still seeing patients for up to 20 hours a week.Companies report in survey after survey that older workers are generally more dependable, punctual and honest than the young. Quite why all feckless 35-year-olds should metamorphose into responsible workers on their 65th birthdays is unclear. What is certain is that as the world gets older, important skills are being lost in the labour market that will not easily be replaced. Keeping older workers on is the most effective way to fill the looming skills gap.But that can only happen if the system is designed to let them stay. Some companies have recognised that older workers have different needs and adjusted working practices. Not everyone has to go as far as Home Depot, which shifts some from Pennsylvania to Florida for the winter months. The simplest measure is to abolish compulsory retirement ages. Mr Fenton and his ilk should not be stuck in some arbitrary corridor of uncertainty. If he can still carry a bat, as cricketers would say, he should be allowed to stay at the crease.

117;HD;Home Depot;2012-09-19T20:06:07Z;Home Depot – big improvement;Retailer boosted by US housing rally but investors must weigh risk of rout;Shares in Home Depot have been on an absolute tear, returning 76 per cent over the past year. Among huge companies ($50bn or more in market capitalisation) worldwide, only AB InBev has performed better, and it has only done so by a point or so.Part of the story here is a delirious rally in anything remotely related to US housing: not just homebuilders but everyone from paint makers (Sherwin-Williams) to materials companies (Louisiana-Pacific) has rocketed. Home Depot has not simply enjoyed the tailwind, however. The improvement in its same-store sales growth (averaging 4.5 per cent over the past four quarters) has easily outpaced its rival home improvement supply chain, Lowe’s. It has expanded margins and managed Wall Street expectations deftly, increasing its sales and earnings guidance with metronomic regularity.The valuation looks overheated on most metrics, though. It trades at 20 times forward earnings, very pricey for a highly cyclical retailer whose same-store sales growth decelerated in its most recent quarter, for the first time in more than a year. All the same, there are three arguments against selling. After suffering almost three years of same-store sales contraction between 2006 and 2009, the company may still have room to expand sales further. Its free cash flow yield, at 6 per cent, is still in line with peers. It also deserves a premium to other retailers (which trade on roughly 15 times earnings) because many of its products are too heavy or bulky for Amazon to deliver.All this is reassuring, but it will pay to consider whether the fundamental strength that led to its outperformance during a housing rally will provide downside protection should that rally turn into a rout. Might this be the right time to put your Home Depot profits to work on, say, that kitchen renovation you’ve been putting off since the housing crisis hit?Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
118;HD;Home Depot;2012-09-14T20:28:48Z;Georgia on my mind;Atlanta has family homes in the heart of the city, a facet few American cities can boast about;In the 1936 civil war novel Gone With the Wind, author Margaret Mitchell described Atlanta as a town built by “pushy …restless, energetic people”.Today Atlanta, in the US state of Georgia, is a sprawling metropolis. Its skyline is a mix of modern and postmodern buildings, punctuated by impressive skyscrapers, mainly the product of the city’s unprecedented economic growth of the past 15 years. The city hosts many Fortune 500 companies, including UPS, Home Depot, Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines.Known as a “city of neighbourhoods”, there is no true city centre, with many residential areas and business districts having sprung up across the region. Atlanta is divided into 25 areas made up of 242 neighbourhoods. Interstate Highway 285 creates a 64-mile loop around the city, and Atlanta’s geography and real estate are divided between those inside and outside this perimeter. Those living inside trade off more expensive homes and higher taxes for a shorter commute.“Atlanta has lots of space – it just keeps on going,” said Sarah Kenagy, a proposal development co-ordinator at Care USA. “There are very few places in America where you can own a family home right in the heart of a city. Atlanta is one of them.”Kenagy owns a two-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Candler Park, about two miles east of Atlanta’s downtown business district. The neighbourhood, popular with those looking for true in-town living, features quaint bungalows and craftsman-style homes on tree-lined streets.For those who choose to live further out, a car is essential. Payson Schwin, a strategic marketing and business development manager at Ericsson, who lives in the Oakhurst neighbourhood, says: “Traffic is very bad and the metro doesn’t stretch to enough places. There isn’t a transit system that is good enough for the average commuter.”The US census shows that Atlanta’s population jumps 62 per cent during the day thanks to commuters. The Beltline, a 22-mile loop around the city connecting more than 40 neighbourhoods with walking trails, parks and, eventually, by either light rail or streetcars, was expected to improve connections, but the project has been dogged by funding issues that are likely to prolong congestion problems.Schwin chose to move to his four-bedroom, family home in the Atlanta suburb known for its arts scene, coffee shops and speciality stores, and for its good schools – the top priority for Atlantans.“In Atlanta you are limited by school districts,” he says. “You can get cheaper housing in other neighbourhoods, but I would like to have children in the future. Also, property values hold over time in neighbourhoods with good schools,” he said.Atlanta was one of the cities hit hardest during the housing market collapse that accompanied the financial crisis. Home prices are 30 per cent below their 2006 peaks and have only recently shown signs of recovery.Janice Quinn, an estate agent at Coldwell Banker, said: “Prices are stabilising. I deal a lot in the luxury market and while the number of showings I have are not the same as before, the buyers are still out there. Now is definitely the time to buy if you have the money.”Quinn says the highest demand is in Buckhead, Garden Hills and Dunwoody in the north, where there are good schools.Among Coldwell Banker’s listings in the area is 2081 Dellwood Drive, a $599,000 three-bedroom, three- bathroom family home, a short walk from Memorial Park. More expensive properties, such as 508 Peachtree Battle Avenue, a four-bedroom, four-bathroom renovated home with heated pool valued at $2.47m, are also listed.While the north of the city is fairly affluent, and the far east and far west mainly industrial, the south side has many lower-income neighbourhoods and the airport. Founded as a railroad hub in 1837 and originally named Terminus, the city is now an airline nerve centre.Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta international airport has, since 2005, been the world’s busiest airport by passenger traffic and number of landings and take-offs, serving 89m passengers a year. Residents in and around the neighbourhood joke that they have to “hold grandma’s picture from falling off the shelf every time a plane takes off”, which happens once every 10 minutes on average, day and night.The state has offered tax incentives to film, television and digital entertainment companies, which has brought individuals such as Neal Holman, an art director, to the city. Holman, who paid $355,000 for a three-bedroom 2,900 sq ft home in the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, said the city offered an affordable standard of living to its residents and spoke highly of its arts and restaurant scene.East Atlanta offers affordable, spacious homes with big gardens, while neighbouring Grant Park, one of the city’s oldest neighbourhoods, is known for Victorian-era mansions, cottages and early 1900s bungalows. At Keller Williams Realty, 512 Park Avenue, a four-bedroom, two-bathroom home in Grant Park, is listed at $650,000.Until recently Atlanta placed little importance on the preservation of its historic architecture, and many venerable buildings were lost. Few structures survive that are older than the turn of the 20th century, with many buildings in the city’s skyline less than 30 years old. But while the city has antebellum roots, Atlanta looks and feels young and vibrant, a testament to its ability to reinvent itself.Despite the city’s constant upheaval and renewal, segregation between Atlanta’s black and white populations still remains. Atlanta is one of the US’s largest black-majority cities and has played a central role in the cultivation of black wealth, political power, education and culture.Peter Bade, agent at RE/MAX Metro Atlanta Cityside, said the city was still divided along income and colour lines. “Segregation is a hindrance to the city. The mindset of some people and lack of diversity in some neighbourhoods is not a good thing. But this is changing with time,” he said.……………………………………………………………..Buying guidePros● Climate● Relaxed pace of life● A well-connected airline hubCons● Good public-sector schools● Heavy traffic● Lack of diversity in some areasWhat you can buy for …$100,000 A one-bedroom condo$1m A three-bedroom home
119;HD;Home Depot;2012-09-14T18:49:55Z;Tax levels playing field for retailers;;Internet retailers will start adding sales tax to items sold to California residents from Saturday, under a new law that is expected to generate tens of millions of dollars for the state.Until now, online retailers from other states – such as Amazon, which is based in Seattle, Washington – have been exempt from collecting California sales tax under a Supreme Court ruling. But a reversal of the legal position has removed the price advantage that they have enjoyed over local bricks-and-mortar shops“The tax levels the playing field for physical retailers,” said Miro Copic, professor of marketing at San Diego State University who studies consumer behaviour. “People will think twice when they’re buying on Amazon. They may hold off on a purchase, or they may go to a local mom and pop store or Home Depot located here.”Sales tax in California starts at a minimum 7.25 per cent, with some cities adding local taxes that take the rate as high as 9.75 per cent. The new law applies to out-of-state retailers that sell more than $1m-worth of goods to California consumers per year, and have more than $10,000 in sales referred by an in-state affiliate.Tax revenue from Amazon’s sales alone could yield the state $83m per year, according to estimates by the state tax board.Amazon campaigned aggressively against the move to tax online shopping, but reversed its position suddenly last year.The company is now supporting efforts to introduce federal bills giving all states the right to levy sales taxes on online retailers– partly to avoid being singled out from its online-only peers.Ebay, the online marketplace, also fought the law – arguing on behalf of the entrepreneurs and small businesses that constitute the majority of its sellers.“We don’t think small businesses anywhere should collect taxes for states where they are not based,” said Brian Bieron, senior director of US government relations for Ebay. “To throw a tax burden on them that is appropriate for giant retailers, we think disproportionately hurts small businesses.”Several other states – including Texas and Pennsylvania – already require online retailers to collect sales tax, following lobbying from bricks-and-mortar retailers.According to research by Nelson Granados, business professor at Pepperdine University, raising prices online has a greater impact on demand than raising prices offline. For every one per cent increase in an online price, demand goes down two per cent, he found.
120;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Home Depot shuts big box stores in China;;Home Depot is to close its last remaining big box stores in China, admitting defeat in a country where it has not found the successful store formats and DIY culture on which its US business depends.The Atlanta-based company said it was closing its seven remaining big box stores in China, resulting in the loss of 850 jobs. It had signalled its dwindling ambitions last January when it closed its final store in Beijing.Home Depot’s decision late on Thursday highlights the issues that some western companies face when trying to transplant foreign business models into China.Retail analysts say Home Depot never found the right business format in a country where the DIY ethos that sustains its US stores is largely absent.“Home Depot failed because it didn’t make any adjustments to its format to fit the way Chinese consumers shop,” said James Roy, analyst at China Market Research group in Shanghai. “Home Depot essentially exported its big box model to China and didn’t adapt.”Mr Roy said Chinese shoppers are more accustomed to buying home decor products in places where there are multiple stores from competing brands, and where brands are grouped by category.Stores that are not adjacent to competitors “do not create enough ‘pull’ as a shopping destination,” noted Torsten Stocker, partner at consulting firm Monitor Group.Mr Roy said: “Consumers feel they can get more choice and do a lot more comparison shopping in these environments. When they see every product category ‘all under one roof’ like at Home Depot, they feel one store can’t be an expert in so many things and trust it less.”“Closing stores is always a difficult decision,” said Frank Blake, Home Depot’s chief executive. “We are thankful for the dedicated service of our store associates in China, and we wish them all the best during this transition.”The company said it would take a $160m charge in the third quarter as a result of the closures. Its shares rose 2.2 per cent on Friday to $59.56.In China low wages, an abundance of migrant labourers and other socioeconomic factors suppress demand for western-style home improvement retailing.China’s home improvement market has also been hard hit by the mainland economic slowdown that has depressed property purchases, the main driver of home improvement spending, retail analysts say – though Home Depot’s problems in China predate the slowdown.Home Depot said it would retain two smaller speciality shops in Tianjin: a paint and flooring store and a home decoration store.It said it will continue to employ 170 people in China, including in its sourcing offices in Shenzhen and Shanghai.
121;HD;Home Depot;2012-09-14T08:52:19Z;China: Home Depot packs its bags;;When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When in China, don’t import your business model from Atlanta and expect it to work.Late on Thursday, Home Depot admitted defeat in its battle to win over Chinese home decorators, announcing the closure of all its ‘everything under one roof’ stores, and 850 job cuts.It’ll continue to operate in China, with two small specialist stores in Tianjin, and an online retail presence.The post-mortem shouldn’t take long: Home Depot died of Best Buy syndrome. Like Best Buy, the biggest electronic retailer in the US and the world, Home Depot thought it could do in China exactly what it did for years in America – offer scale and convenience to shoppers, rather than the choice and competition they can find on the high street.China’s cooling housing market hasn’t helped much either.The writing has been on the wall for a while. And rivals aren’t faring much better: UK-based Kingfisher this week reported falling sales and stubborn losses at its China unit. It is still looking for a new business model for its B&Q stores in the country.The lessons drawn are not entirely new. The choice and competition offered by local outfits is exactly what Chinese customers seem to want. While KFC and McDonald’s may be scoring well exporting their brand of Americana, doorknobs and thumbtacks aren’t nearly so tasty. China’s retail market is also very crowded – being big and foreign doesn’t have the cachet that some once assumed.At least Home Depot can take some comfort from its wider performance. Shares are up almost 80 per cent in the past 12 months. Best Buy, meanwhile, is down by almost a quarter.But the message from their China experience is pretty similar: Chinese shoppers prefer to do it their way.
122;HD;Home Depot;2012-09-02T15:54:44Z;Index points to new dawn for US housing;;Even the biggest investment bubbles eventually correct themselves. When that happens, it is time for changed thinking. That is particularly true when the bursting of the bubble in question – in US residential housing – nearly brought down the entire global financial system.The US housing market’s correction after that bubble appears to be finally at an end. This shows up in house prices, where the latest reading of the Case-Shiller 20-city index this week showed an increase over the past 12 months.The Case-Shiller index has had a couple of false dawns, but other data support it this time. Activity is picking up, and supply – by the most popular definition of the number of months it would take to sell off the existing inventory of unsold houses – is under control.Housing is hard to treat as a national market. But Case-Shiller shows that the most extreme bubbles have popped. Low-tier Miami housing, which gained 241 per cent from 2000 to 2007, is now only 19 per cent above its 2000 level, having failed to keep track of inflation over that time. In Las Vegas, the cheapest housing is now 25 per cent below its level of 2000, after rising more than 150 per cent in the interim.Valuation also suggests that home prices cannot fall much further. According to JPMorgan Chase, the average house now costs 19.9 times the rent it could receive. The long-term average is 20.6 times and the bubble-era peak in 2006 was 33.5 times.Taking into account the cost of financing a purchase, houses look downright cheap. The benchmark yield on 30-year Fannie Mae mortgage bonds is below 3 per cent, after a decline that has lasted for decades.“Shadow inventory” continues to be a concern. Forced sales resulting from the burst bubble, and from the recession that has followed it, weigh on house prices and banks’ balance sheets alike.A return to all-out recession would certainly exacerbate this problem, but for now the evidence is again of significant improvement. The latest report from the New York Federal Reserve shows mortgage delinquency rates declining, as is overall US household indebtedness.Then there may be reasons for longer-term optimism. JPMorgan this week released a bullish report pointing out that demographics are improving. In the next decade the “echo boom” generation will start to try to buy houses. The US adult population will increase by 15.3m in the next five years – faster than the 12.8m increase in the past five years. Meanwhile, there is a population of some 2.3m “basement dwellers” – adults who have returned to live with their parents, and presumably want a place of their own.At a macro level, if the housing market’s problems have been sorted out, the risks facing the US economy are much reduced. At a micro level, it may be harder to make money. Stock markets are on to the housing recovery, even if others are not.The homebuilders’ index is by far the strongest sub-sector of the S&P 500 so far this year, up almost 70 per cent. It has rallied by 184 per cent since its recent low last autumn, but remains some 65 per cent below its 2005 peak. Homebuilders’ share prices anticipated both the boom and the bust in house prices during the last decade, so growth like that is unlikely to continue for much longer.The bulls at JPMorgan point out that housing follows a long cycle. A boon for timber providers can be followed by booms for homebuilders, mortgage financiers, and home supplies retailers as the cycle works its way through. But a lot is in the prices of all these sectors. Home improvement retailers – Home Depot and Lowe’s – are up 60 per cent in the past 12 months, as is the timber group Weyerhaeuser. The retailers are above their pre-Lehman peak.And playing this housing cycle could be difficult, because it is unlike all its predecessors. Ben Bernanke was right when he fatefully reassured Congress before the crisis that there had never before been a national decline in house prices. There is a lack of precedent for a cycle that starts with many homeowners in large markets nursing losses in excess of 50 per cent. It is unclear how this recovery will play out. Certainly nobody in their right mind should expect homebuilding stocks to repeat their bubble-time performance from the beginning of the last decade.There is also the interest-rate cycle. Propping up the mortgage and housing markets has been a key aim of the Fed’s loose monetary policy. If the housing market embarks on a robust recovery, then the Fed would rightly respond by raising interest rates. And of course the risk of renewed recession remains real. Betting now on a long recovery in the housing cycle is no sure thing.But there is a clear conclusion for anyone now in rented accommodation in the US. If they want to buy their own place, there is unlikely ever to be a much better time to do so than now.john.authers@ft.com
123;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;A mission to reach the next level;Paul Raines, head of GameStop, will have to navigate obstacles worthy of Super Mario;"Standing in a GameStop store off San Francisco’s Union Square, it is not hard to survey the walls lined with disk-based titles and imagine this video game outlet going the way of Virgin Mega­store and three big bookstores that have closed nearby in recent years.The growth of digital media and web sales helped destroy those books-and-mortar and CDs-and-cement businesses. But the store manager has come over to chat with Paul Raines, chief executive of GameStop, and says that while his branch will indeed be shutting down soon it is simply in order to move to better premises on a busier street.“We’re going to have stores for a very long time,” says Mr Raines, who has headed GameStop for two years, and visits the stores regularly. “That’s because they are more than a transaction space, they’re a place to go for a community of gamers to talk about and discover games.”You could say people also like to talk about books, music and movies in bookstores, record shops and Blockbuster-style video rental stores – and much good it did them.But Mr Raines, who stands out among the casually dressed, mainly male browsers in his neat dark suit and open-neck blue shirt, responds that he can offer plenty of evidence that with more than 6,000 GameStop and EB Games stores in 15 countries, and where the staff are avid gamers, his strategy to meet the digital challenge is on course.It needs to be. GameStop is facing as many obstacles as a Super Mario game. The industry is moving to digital distribution and there are fewer lures to pull customers into stores, as struggling publishers cut down the number of titles they launch a year and console makers delay their next-generation machines.GameStop has tried to find other lines of profitable business, such as trading used games and electronic goods, selling new tablets, making its own hardware and streaming games, but these also put it in intense competition with other retailers, manufacturers, publishers and online services. “GameStop’s is a unique story,” says Mr Raines. “It’s a company with a lot of transitions happening at the same time in a category that is maybe the most pressured of all right now.”Born in Costa Rica in 1964, he grew up in the US and studied at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. “I’m very active with a lot of Hispanic groups,” he says. “Costa Rica is a small country and needs everyone pitching for it.”● Born: 1964, San José, Costa Rica

● Personal: Married. Enjoys playing video games with his son and daughter. Board director of Advanced Auto Parts; member of the advisory board of Georgia TechHe initially joined GameStop as chief operating officer four years ago after its two founders – Daniel DeMatteo and Richard Fontaine, who had run the company since 1996 – decided they wanted to hand over to a professional management team. Mr Raines joined from Home Depot, where he had been executive vice-president of US stores, after four years in global sourcing for the clothing retailer LL Bean. One of his remits was to carry out a strategic review as the threat from digital loomed.“I’d worked for two founders at Home Depot – Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank – so one of the reasons I came here was I felt like, and I think so did they, that I had some skills in the area of transitioning the company from founders’ leadership to professional management,” he says.“LL Bean and Home Depot are arguably two of the greatest retailers of the past century, for different reasons. LL Bean has [excellent] customer service and values …Home Depot is an extraordinary growth story, also with a focus on customer service.”The danger with joining founders is that they can be resistant to change, but Mr Raines says the opposite was true. “Dan DeMatteo is still executive chairman and is really one of the architects of our strategy. He’s fully engaged and it really helps because he’s able to align the board …in today’s environment you must have a chairman that’s aligning the board around change, otherwise you can never win those battles.” He adds: “I lived through leadership transitions at Home Depot and I learnt a lot.”Mr Raines led a six-month strategic review that began with a study of where other similar stores, such as Blockbuster or Tower Records, had gone wrong.“Many of the companies we looked at had a high debt load, so we’ve eliminated that – we’re one of 28 debt-free companies in the S&P 500. [The other stores] also did not embrace the rate of change around new technology, so we’ve pushed very hard to do that in a rational way, without overpaying for our acquisitions.”One of the lessons he learnt at Home Depot was to “move with velocity” rather than waiting to respond to events.“You really have to understand multiple models and navigate through a rate of change that has been very aggressive,” he says.Most of the strategic recommendations he made to the board have been implemented, he says. One was a loyalty programme, called PowerUp Rewards. Its 18m members are responsible for 35 per cent to 40 per cent of all video game consumption in the US, according to the company.A second tactic was for GameStop to become the first games retailer to introduce digital content sales in stores, in which shoppers download games in-store and buy items such as Facebook credits or gift cards.A recommendation to exploit gaming innovations led to the creation of a $100m venture fund. It in turn led to acquisitions including Kongregate, a casual gaming online service; Impulse, a digital-download gaming service; and Spawn Labs, a video game-streaming cloud service that is awaiting its launch.“I think generally they’ve been the right decisions, one or two things I’d of course correct, but as you look at how everybody else has fallen by the wayside, while we are certainly not through the woods, we do believe we’ve made good choices and the company is positioned very well.”GameStop is the market share lead­er in video games, fighting off competition from Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon. It competes with online services such as NextWorth and Gazelle in the higher-margin business of trading in used electronic goods, but he points out that its bricks and mortar store network gives it a presence they lack.…A 200,000 sq ft facility near GameStop’s Texas headquarters employs 1,100 people to refurbish the traded-in game disks, consoles, tablets and phones. It also houses an R&D unit where a bestselling Bluetooth gaming controller for tablets was developed for sale in store alongside Google’s Nexus 7 tablet.Mr Raines has become more of a gamer himself since joining the company, playing about four hours a week. “I played a lot of video games growing up and with my kids.”Because the company employs staff who are “very passionate about gaming”, he says, that involves the senior executives too. “We have to be authentic about this – I force myself to play every game, even though I’m not a big fan of some genres.” The fantasy role-playing games (RPGs) are among his least favourite.In real life, meanwhile, he is playing his own real-time strategy game – as he plots the course of GameStop’s digital transition and creates complementary businesses."
124;HD;Home Depot;2012-08-20T20:44:38Z;Lowe’s slips as earnings miss forecasts;;Shares in Lowe’s retreated on Monday after the US home improvement retailer reported quarterly earnings that were worse than expected due to weak same-store sales.The stock fell 5.8 per cent to $26.26 as the company recorded earnings per share of 65 cents, which missed the average analyst estimate of 70 cents a share. The retailer also lowered its full-year outlook.Alan Rifkin, analyst at Barclays, said: “Lowe’s performance confirms our view that the company should be focusing all of its efforts on stabilising its current business …The company lowered guidance for the second time this year, suggesting that it continues to lose [market] share to its key rival Home Depot.”Mr Rifkin lowered the stock’s 12-month target price to $25 from $30, adding that the company was unlikely to benefit from any significant improvement in the housing market during the second half.Laura Champine, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, maintained a “hold” rating on the stock and said the company faces “execution issues amid slow recovery”.The consumer discretionary sector, which includes Lowe’s, was the second-worst performer behind telecommunications. Lowes rival Home Depot was down 0.3 per cent to $56.57.Best Buy fell 10.4 per cent to $18.16 after the electronic retailer said it had appointed Hubert Joly as its new chief executive officer, while the company’s takeover talk with its founder, Richard Schulze, broke down over the weekend.Daniel Binder, analyst at Jefferies, gave the stock a “hold” rating and said: “What will matter more is the restructuring plan we expect management to detail. Further, the exchange between Mr Schulze and the board continues to play out, each trying to gain more ground with shareholders.”Mr Binder also said investors were waiting for the turnround plan of the company.“While we have not yet heard management’s plan, we suspect the cornerstone of the strategy will probably be building the services business, while at the same time focusing on additional cost cutting so that it can reinvest in price and protect market share, a process that is already under way. [But] a large-scale turnround could take two to three years and may be better executed as a private company.”By contrast, Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, continued to rally and closed at a record level of $665.15, up 2.6 per cent.Aaron Rakers, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, who gave the stock a “buy” rating and set the 12-month target price at $825, said: “A major near-term catalyst is Apple’s widely-anticipated iPhone 5 launch in September or October.”Investment banking group Jefferies also raised Apple’s target price to $900 last Friday. The biggest US company has gained 7 per cent over the past week.Facebook bounced back to $20.05 and gained 5.3 per cent as Rory Maher, analyst at Capstone Investments, upgraded the social networking site to “buy” from “hold”. Microsoft dropped 0.5 per cent to $30.74.Six of 10 S&P sectors traded in negative territory with the information technology and financials indices recording gains. Both subgroups added 0.3 per cent, respectively.Shares in Aetna rose 5.6 per cent to $40.18 after the healthcare company said it would acquire Coventry Health Care for $5.7bn. The deal comes on the heels of WellPoint’s acquisition of Amerigroup Corp for $4.9bn last month.Coventry Health Care jumped 20.3 per cent to $42.04. The stock has gained 30 per cent last week.The merger, which is expected to close in mid-2013, would increase Aetna’s medical membership in Medicare and Medicaid.Chris Rigg, analyst at Susquehanna, cheered the transaction from a strategic perspective as the deal would substantially improve Aetna’s positioning in health insurance exchange in 2014 and beyond.However, credit rating agencies Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's cautioned possible financial risks would be imposed on Aetna by the large acquisition.Overall, the broader market lost momentum on Monday after gaining for six consecutive weeks as investors remained cautious over the eurozone debt crisis.The S&P 500 closed flat at 1,418.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped fractionally to 13,271.64 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index also declined fractionally to 3,076.21.William Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, said: “Developments out of Europe could be a driver of markets this week. One potential catalyst for markets will be the European Central Bank’s impending announcement of the details of its newest market intervention scheme, which was promised on August 2.”
125;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Retail results show economic bright spot;;Home Depot, TJX and Estée Lauder overcame uncertainty in the US economy to earn decent quarterly profits from their sales of home improvement wares, discount clothing and cosmetics.The results from three corners of the consumer market did not provide solid evidence of an upturn in consumer sentiment, but highlighted how some companies were doing well in spite of its fragility.At Home Depot, the biggest US seller of DIY goods, sales hit $20.6bn with like-for-like growth slowing to 2.1 per cent from 5.8 per cent in the previous quarter against the backdrop of a weak housing market.But the company beat Wall Street earnings expectations, reporting net income of $1.5bn – or $1.01 a share – in the quarter to the end of July, up 12 per cent from a year ago thanks to tighter cost control and savings in its supply chain.The company said it expected sales to be up 4.6 per cent this financial year and raised its earnings guidance for the same period. Its shares closed up 3.6 per cent at $54.71 on Tuesday.The TJX discount companies, which include TJ Maxx in the US and TK Maxx in Europe, reported net sales of $5.9bn with like-for-like growth of 7 per cent in the quarter to the end of July. It said customer numbers were up “substantially” in the US, Canada and Europe.The group’s net income rose more than 20 per cent to $421m – or 56 cents a share, one cent ahead of market expectations. Its shares closed up 1.8 per cent at $45.03.By selling cut-price clothes and household goods, TJX tends to perform well when cash-strapped consumers seek trade down to cheaper products, but it can also benefit in an improving economy as people spend more on discretionary items, said Lazard analysts.Estée Lauder, which sells higher-end products than Home Depot and TJX, reported strong demand for its mascaras, lipsticks and face creams in the US and China and from shoppers travelling overseas, triggering a 9.3 per cent jump in its shares to $60.13.Net sales expanded by 9 per cent year-on-year to $2.25bn in the quarter to the end of June, ahead of Wall Street forecasts, and net income climbed 25 per cent to $51.2m, or 13 cents a share.Fabrizio Freda, chief executive, said: “Our sales grew at twice the rate of worldwide prestige beauty.” But the company said it saw increased weakness in western Europe, South Korea and Australia and remained cautious about slowing growth in China.US government figures published on Tuesday showed a rebound in retail sales in July, which grew by 0.8 per cent from June, the first increase in four months.
126;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Mexicans still shopping, Brazilians less so;;"As the US-based DIY chain The Home Depot opened its 91st warehouse-style store in little more than a decade in Mexico, more evidence emerged of strong consumer demand — if not yet a boom.May retail sales rose by 5.2 per cent year-on-year, though they slipped by 0.2 per cent compared with April, consistent with an 8.6 per cent fall in consumer goods imports.And the year-on-year growth was strongest, at 8 per cent, for the big-ticket household items in which The Home Depot specialises. Vehicles also grew by 7.7 per cent.A Barclays research note commenting on the figures said that May was expected to be the softest month for activity in the second quarter. “But we continue to carry a positive view for the months to come,” it adds.For aficionados of the current boxing match between the economies of Brazil and Mexico, the round on May’s retail figures provided Mexico with a clear victory.Mexico’s figures were positive while Brazil’s were described by some observers as disastrous. A bloody nose to Brazil, then, and possibly a cut eye into the bargain.Felipe Calderón, the Mexican president, captured the mood as he announced a $420m General Motors investment. Economic growth for the year will reach 4 per cent, he said. “We expect to hit the mark.”So does Barclays, which points out that the increase in retail sales translates into the creation of more than 380,000 jobs in the first five months of the year.Related reading:

127;HD;Home Depot;2012-03-13T19:21:30Z;Doubt over strength of Wall St bull run;;Fears about the sustainability of the Wall Street bull run have grown, with many stocks sitting out a rally that has taken the S&P 500 to a fresh post-crisis high.There were 72 stocks in the S&P 500 that hit 52-week highs on Tuesday, according to data from FactSet, compared with more than 100 when the market last peaked on April 29 last year.Analysts watch the 52-week high figure as an indicator of how confident investors are about the overall market, rather than individual stocks.“Typically when the market is rising, you want to see an expansion in the percentage of stocks making new highs,” said Paul Hickey, a senior analyst at Bespoke Investment Group in New York. “[But] the percentage hitting new highs has been anaemic.”Part of the explanation is the strong performance of Apple, which has seen its weighting in the S&P 500 index climb to more than 4 per cent. Bespoke estimates that Apple has contributed at least 20 points to the S&P 500 since last April, as its shares have rallied 64 per cent, or more than $200.But analysis of which stocks are hitting highs also points to continued nervousness about the strength of the global economy. Just 2 material stocks and 3 energy stocks in the S&P 500 hit 52-week highs on Tuesday. Both sectors are considered cyclical, and are expected to outperform in a rising market.Despite a strong performance for bank stocks on Tuesday, companies such as Bank of America remain well short of 52-week highs. Wells Fargo alone among the six largest large banks stocks touched a year high on Tuesday. However, not all analysts are concerned.“If you call a top to the market based on one indicator, you’re asking for trouble,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at investment bank RW Baird. Other technical indicators continue to suggest a healthy market.Of S&P 500 industry groups, 83 per cent recorded gains last week, the highest percentage so far this year, suggesting broad participation in the rally.The flipside to lingering macroeconomic concerns is also growing confidence in domestic-focused stocks. More consumer discretionary stocks made 52-week highs on Tuesday than on April 29 last year, along with technology stocks, the only sector for which that was the case.All three home builders in the S&P 500, as well as home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe’s, were among the stocks making 52-week highs on Tuesday, suggesting sentiment may finally be changing towards companies that have been a big drag on the index’s post-crisis recovery.“US consumer spending has reached levels above prior highs in the economy,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. “I’m still bullish. I have a target of 1,425 on the S&P 500.”
128;HD;Home Depot;2012-03-12T21:20:16Z;Wall St steady despite global worries;;US equities were mixed on Monday as fresh economic data out of China added to growing concerns that the world’s second-largest economy was cooling.The S&P 500 was up fractionally on the day to 1,371.09 as markets reacted to news that a drop in exports had caused China’s trade deficit to widen last month and provided further evidence that global demand was slackening.Shares were sent to their worst performance in nearly three months last Tuesday after China revised down its growth forecasts for 2012. Stocks recovered later in the week as a resolution to a Greek debt restructuring deal was reached and strong non-farm payroll employment data from the US supported hopes of a labour market recovery.China’s two largest online video providers, Youku and Tudou, soared as the US-listed companies announced an all-share merger on Monday that raised the prospect of creating a profitable market leader. Shares in larger Youku climbed 27.4 per cent to $31.85, while smaller rival Tudou jumped 156.5 per cent to $39.48.Banks were leading the losers with the benchmark index’s financials off by as much as 0.8 per cent as the day began with reports that Greece’s new bonds – following last week’s debt swap – were trading at distressed levels. Citigroup recovered early day losses and ended up 0.3 per cent to $34.29, while Wells Fargo dropped 0.5 per cent to $31.51. Bank of America fell below the $8 threshold, down 0.8 per cent to $7.99 and Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $18.20.But volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, continued to fall, down 7 per cent to 15.92. The Vix, or Wall Street “fear gauge”, climbed above 20 before resettling last week as fears of global economic woes crept back into the market.The S&P 500 utilities index was the best performing sector, up 1.1 per cent. Gains were led by Constellation Energy, which added 3 per cent to $37.23 and Edison International, which climbed 1.8 per cent to $43.69.The Nasdaq Composite index moved down 0.2 per cent to 2,983.66, edging away from the 3,000 mark that it eclipsed two weeks ago for the first time since the dotcom boom. The Nasdaq fell despite gains by Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the index. The company finished up 1.3 per cent to $552.Oracle, the software company, lost 1.4 per cent to $29.71 after Jefferies lowered its rating from “buy” to “hold”.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.3 per cent to 12,959.71. The blue-chip heavy index was led by ExxonMobil, which rose 1.5 per cent to $85.55. The oil company was reported as having reached an agreement for payments with the government of Iraq for work on an oilfield in West Qurna.Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, climbed 0.2 per cent to $29.84 after being upgraded from “hold” to “buy” by Nomura.“Lowe’s has begun to make tough decisions . . . In many ways, it is following what Home Depot did three years earlier when it slowed growth, shut stores, cut costs and addressed inventory. The bottom line is that Lowe’s has begun to play offence,” said Aram Rubinson, analyst at Nomura.Rival home improvement group Home Depot was up 0.5 per cent at $48.59 even as Nomura maintained its “hold” rating on the company’s shares.United Continental Holdings, the parent of United Airlines, was down 1 per cent to $19.62 after analysts at Bank of America downgraded shares in the recently merged company from “buy” to “hold”, citing oil prices. Southwest Airlines, another US carrier, fell 2.4 per cent to $8.28.Harley-Davidson, the iconic motorcycle maker, hit a 52-week high and closed up 2.6 per cent to $48.11 after analysts at Citigroup raised its price target.Confectioner Hershey gained 1.8 per cent to $60.56. The chocolate maker was upgraded from “hold” to “buy” by equity analysts at Goldman Sachs Investor Research.Michael Kors, the retail group, fell by as much as 5.8 per cent before finishing down 2.1 per cent to $48.57. The company, which went public last December, said shareholders had agreed to waive lock-up restrictions with underwriters.American Apparel rose 21.5 per cent to $0.91 on a report that George Soros was considering offering a credit line to the struggling retailer.
129;HD;Home Depot;2012-03-09T20:52:27Z;Limbaugh carries on with limited advertising;;Advertisers abandoned Rush Limbaugh’s syndicated radio show en masse this week, reacting to the conservative radio host’s attacks on Sandra Fluke, a law student who argued that health insurance should cover birth control.Mr Limbaugh’s remarks about Ms Fluke sparked outrage and led to a social media campaign calling on advertisers to stop supporting the show, an effort that quickly went viral, shining a harsh spotlight on those companies still airing ads.A week on, at least 50 companies have stopped airing ads during the show, including big brands such as Home Depot, Netflix, JC Penney and AOL. At least two radio stations, in Massachusetts and Hawaii, have also stopped airing Mr Limbaugh’s talk show.Mr Limbaugh initially dismissed the impact of the advertiser defections. On Monday’s show, he said: “So be it.”But by Thursday, the online broadcast of Mr Limbaugh’s show carried just nine advertisements over three hours. In place of the ads were public service announcements from groups such as the United Negro College Fund and the New York Office of Emergency Management.Mr Limbaugh’s show is distributed by Premiere Networks, a division of Clear Channel. Clear Channel is owned by Thomas H Lee Partners and Bain Capital, the private equity firm where Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made his fortune. Clear Channel was acquired by Bain after Mr Romney stepped down from the private equity firm, but Mr Romney still profits from the firm’s activities.Clear Channel signed a $400m contract with Mr Limbaugh in 2008 that will keep him on air through 2016.Mr Limbaugh suggested that those companies that stopped advertising with him were suffering from their abandonment of his show. “You can look at the stock price of some of these companies,” he said. “I’m not going to say any more.” Home Depot and AOL were slightly up this week, but Netflix and JC Penney were down in a flat market.And while it may not be related to their pulling ads from the show, some research suggests that there may indeed be a correlation between companies targeted by boycotts and share prices.“The evidence is that boycotts that generate a lot of media attention and are targeted against a specific company tend to hurt the market value of the company,” said Brayden King, professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “There is a negative affect on their image and reputation.”Late in the week, Mr Limbaugh remained defiant, denying reports that he would suspend his show. “They thought I would be off the air by now,” he said of his critics. “They can’t understand why I still am on the air.”
130;HD;Home Depot;2012-02-29T20:59:44Z;Nasdaq and the markets;What we make of this latest burst of prosperity depends how it is measured;Technical analysts, market psychologists, and other practitioners of the financial black arts are having a busy winter. One supposedly significant milestone after another falls: Dow hits 13,000, the Nasdaq’s 2007 high, Apple’s $500bn valuation. But there is a non-voodoo message here too – we’ve simply had a serious rally.A little reflection would not hurt. What we make of this latest burst of prosperity depends heavily on how it is measured, and it pays to avoid complexity. So take a highly liquid and transparent group of companies from a range of industries: the 50 biggest US companies by market capitalisation. The members of this sample have added $1.2tn in market cap since many indices bottomed on October 3 last year, a 23 per cent gain, according to Capital IQ. The gains have been very evenly spread. Yes, Apple is a large contributor, but strike it out and the remaining 49 are still up 22 per cent. Only one of these 50 companies has not notched up gains during the rally: Amazon, burdened with both a dizzying valuation and declining margins. And the best performers of the 50 are diverse. The likes of Citigroup, Comcast, Occidental Petroleum, Walt Disney and Home Depot have risen by more than 40 per cent. If one sector stands out, it is the banks – the six in the sample grew their market caps more, in aggregate ($167bn) than Apple did ($150bn).The underperformers have more in common. They are mostly defensive stocks. Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Bristol-Myers Squibb all had single-digit percentage gains. They would have lagged even if their performances were adjusted to include their considerable dividends. If holders of these sedate names are feeling regret, it will probably be replaced by a sense of relief if the winter of our market content is made unglorious summer.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
131;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Retailers seek fresh strategies to survive;;Few US retailers had a great holiday season and results for the Christmas quarter reported this week underlined how many of them still need to reform to survive in an overcrowded market.Already in the midst of an overhaul is JC Penney, the department store chain now led by the former head of Apple’s retail business. JC Penney reported a net loss of $87m on Friday due to the costs of shaking up its management and laying the foundations to reform its pricing.Its new era of low prices and no unpredictable discounts began on February 1 – and JC Penney said sales so far were below last year. But a 1.8 per cent fall in like-for-like sales in the three months to January 28 was a reminder that something had to change.Walmart, the mass market discounter, has been cutting prices to win back customers it lost during the recession. It patted itself on the back for a second consecutive rise in US like-for-like sales, even though it did not show the momentum investors wanted.Gap, which has spent years trying unsuccessfully to restore its fashion touch, reported sales down 3 per cent at Gap-branded North America stores.Sears Holdings, another turnround story that has so far failed to materialise, signalled a radical change of course by spinning off part of its business and selling 11 stores to raise up to $770m as it reported a net loss of $2.4bn.Perhaps the best performance of the week came from Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, where improved customer service, a reformed supply chain and cost-cutting helped it to 6.1 per cent US sales growth and a 32 per cent rise in net income.
132;HD;Home Depot;2012-02-21T23:54:35Z;Price cuts weigh on Walmart profits;;Walmart missed Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter earnings after price-cutting to win back customers hit profits.Shares in the world’s largest retailer by revenue closed down nearly 4 per cent on Tuesday even though it reported a second straight quarter of US sales growth.To revive US sales after it lost customers during the recession, Walmart has made investments in lowering prices and broadening its product range.Charles Holley, chief financial officer, said price cuts had contributed to a 0.3 percentage point fall in gross margin in the three months to January 29.Sales rose 1.5 per cent at ­Walmart-branded US stores open at least a year, falling short of Wall Street forecasts of 1.8 per cent growth.This followed a 1.3 per cent rise in the previous quarter that ended a run of eight straight declines.David Schick, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said: “The core part of the business did not show the acceleration that was expected.”Walmart shares closed down 3.9 per cent at $60.07 while the broader market rose 0.3 per cent.Mr Holley said the company’s customer base remained under pressure in spite of lower US unemployment.Home Depot, meanwhile, reported strong results but saw no sign of recovery in US housing.Excluding unexpected benefits from tax and real estate deals, Walmart reported earnings per share of $1.44, 10 cents up on a year ago but 1 cent short of Wall Street expectations.The group also reported an operating loss in its China business.Tal Lev, vice-president at Consumer Edge Research, said: “If you look at return on investment over the whole group, it’s been declining for a few quarters and it’s now at a new low.”Growth in the size of Walmart’s inventories was a source of concern as it tied up cash flow and could force the retailer to discount more heavily to clear merchandise, he said.The midpoint of its earnings guidance for the year – $4.72 to $4.92 a share – pointed to a 6 per cent rise in earnings from 2011 but was below the market consensus of $4.90 a share.In its international business, which Walmart has relied on to offset the lacklustre US, sales rose 13.1 per cent to $35.48bn but growth slowed from the ­previous quarter.Global net income fell 14.7 per cent from a year ago to $5.16bn, due to the effect of a $1bn tax benefit in the previous year from a business it closed in Germany.Income from continuing operations rose 3.4 per cent.Mr Holley said US unemployment had not yet fallen to a level where financial pressure on Walmart’s core low-income customers had visibly eased.“Job security is still the number one item that the customer is worried about,” he said. “The second would be rising food costs, and the third would be gas and energy prices.”
133;HD;Home Depot;2012-02-21T18:02:48Z;Home Depot given warm winter boost;;Home Depot, the US’s biggest home improvement retailer by revenue, reported strong quarterly sales and profits as a warm winter encouraged consumers to spend even though the housing market remains stalled.The company beat Wall Street forecasts as it reported sales up 5.9 per cent from a year ago at $16bn and net earnings that jumped 32 per cent to $774m, or 50 cents a share, in the three months to January 29.Frank Blake, Home Depot’s chief executive, said an unseasonably warm and snowless winter had boosted its performance by attracting more consumers out to shop and lifting sales of building materials in particular.Home Depot shares gained 0.5 per cent to close at $46.92 in New York, while the S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher.The retailer has improved its profitability by cutting its expenses as a percentage of sales and reforming its supply chain.But Mr Blake cautioned against interpreting Home Depot’s results as an indicator that the housing market was strengthening. “We think it is too early to say that there’s been a significant improvement in our overall market,” he said.Gary Balter, analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a research note that Home Depot’s strong performance in the absence of a housing pick-up meant its profit margins could expand even further “if and when housing recovers”.
134;HD;Home Depot;2012-01-19T00:15:18Z;PayPal’s strength drives growth at Ebay;International revenues surpass the US’s for the first time;Ebay reported strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2011, driven mainly by its payment arm, PayPal, which the company expects to be at the centre of its innovation in the coming year, despite the recent departure of its president, Scott Thompson, for Yahoo.“We will not skip a beat as we manage the transition at PayPal,” said John Donahoe, chief executive of Ebay and interim president at PayPal. “I’ve spent a lot of time with the PayPal leadership team over the last two weeks. They have enormous ownership over the PayPal vision and enormous commitment to the PayPal plan.”Ebay reported a 35 per cent increase in revenues for the fourth quarter to $3.4bn, compared with $2.5bn in the same quarter last year. PayPal revenue increased 28 per cent to $1.2bn, compared with $971m the year before.Ebay reported net income of $789m, or 60 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, ahead of analysts’ estimates of 57 cents per share on revenues of $3.32bn, and a 15 per cent increase over the same quarter last year.By GAAP measures, Ebay’s net income grew to $1.98bn, or $1.51 per share, up from $559m, or 42 cents per share, mainly due to its sale of Skype being completed.The company forecast first quarter earnings of 50 to 51 cents per share on $3.05bn to $3.15bn in revenue, below analysts’ expectations of 54 cents per share on $3.16bn in revenue.Much of PayPal’s growth is coming from non-US and emerging markets. In the fourth quarter, revenues from international markets surpassed revenues from the US for the first time.But managing cross-border trade has presented some challenges for Ebay recently, particularly with the weakened euro. It has been difficult for sellers in weaker currency markets to make deals with consumers in stronger currency markets.Bob Swan, Ebay’s chief financial officer, said that while the company remained “anxious” about cross-border volumes related to the weakened euro, “we are bullish about web-enabled commerce overall, and ecommerce in particular”.Cross-border trade accounts for 20 per cent of Ebay’s marketplaces business and 25 per cent of PayPal’s business, Mr Swan said.PayPal continued to drive growth by increasing adoption of its services, adding 1m new accounts per month in 2011, and closing the quarter with 106m registered accounts.Mr Donahoe said the company would continue to push for growth in mobile payments as consumers increasingly used smartphones and tablets to shop online.He promised more partnerships with retailers, and revealed one “walletless” payment experiment with Home Depot, the US home improvement chain. Starting in stores in the San Francisco Bay area, customers will be able to pay for purchases by swiping a PayPal card or entering their mobile phone number with a pin.Ebay shares were up nearly 2 per cent in after-hours trading.
135;HD;Home Depot;2012-01-05T20:03:10Z;US groups have $2tn to play with this year;;The biggest US companies may have as much as $2tn in cash available to spend in 2012, powering a potential surge in share buy-backs and dividend payments.A combination of cash on the books plus low levels of leverage and strong expected profits add up to just under $2tn that could be available for non-financial groups in the S&P 500, according to figures compiled by JPMorgan Chase.Amid a struggling global economy, US companies in most industries have been hesitant to launch major new investments or complete large acquisitions, and have been primarily using cash to repurchase their shares and pay dividends.“If more firms were optimistic about the future and seeing new opportunities, this money could go to investment,” said Marc Zenner, head of Corporate Finance Advisory at JPMorgan. “Doing share buy-backs is a less risky option, especially when valuations are low. It shows capital discipline and enthusiasm about the stock’s future, and can also fend off activists,” he said.With large, non-bank companies continuing to delever from peak levels in 2007, the average debt-to-earnings ratio of two times is below the 2.4 times average seen from 1996 to 2009. They also have 11.3 per cent of their assets in cash on average, versus 7.3 per cent from 1996 to 2009.If these figures reverted to historical averages, in part through new issuance of debt, it would generate about $1.2tn in cash, JPMorgan said. That would be in addition to roughly $800bn of cash on hand and anticipated 2012 free cash flow.Last year, large US corporates spent $336bn on share buy-backs from the fourth quarter of 2010 through the third quarter of 2011, the most recent quarter for which figures are available, the most since 2007. They also raised dividend pay-outs by 11 per cent in 2011.Some $40bn of those buy-backs were financed by issuance of debt. Fitch Ratings has projected that figure will probably increase this year, as yields for the most creditworthy corporate borrowers are near record lows due to investor demand for the relative safety of bonds.“I don’t think buy-backs are going to slow. There’s so much cash on the sidelines that shareholders want,” said Robert Leonard, managing director of the special equity transactions group at Citigroup.Mr Leonard projects that buy-back activity will remain in the $75bn-$100bn a quarter range, and that companies will continue to raise dividends, given investor demand for yield.Groups such as Intel and Home Depot raised debt to fund share buy-backs of more than $2bn last year. Companies that enter 2012 with cash greater than 10 per cent of assets and low debt include many software companies, such as Microsoft and Google, but also groups such as MasterCard, the payment processing firm, and Accenture, the consultancy.Cash spent on shares and dividends has also been a positive factor for the stock market’s performance during a volatile year. The $2tn in cash represents some 10 per cent of the market value of large US non-financial groups.
136;HD;Home Depot;2011-12-20T22:25:22Z;US data boost homebuilding stocks;;Homebuilders led a strong rally in US stocks as the S&P 500 enjoyed its best day so far in December.PulteGroup rose 10.4 per cent to $6.17, DR Horton was gaining 5.7 per cent to $12.43 and Lennar climbed 6.3 per cent to $19.68, as construction starts hit their highest level in a year in November.Home improvement retailers were boosted, with Masco rising 8.9 per cent to $9.82 and Home Depot adding 4.3 per cent to $41.93.Some analysts were cautious, however, noting that much of the rise was due to building works starting on apartment blocks, which hit a three-year high.“The report doesn’t signal any turn in fortunes for the lion’s share of the market – single family homes,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “Activity there rose by just 10,000 units to a 447,000 annualised pace and the highest in only five months.”Other analysts warned that Tuesday’s gains could be reversed by a change in sentiment, noting the high volatility of homebuilder stocks. All three large US homebuilders had fallen on Monday, in spite of a confidence survey rising to its highest level of the year.Broader markets bounced with the S&P 500 adding 3 per cent to 1,241.30 after its best day of the month. However, the benchmark US index remains in negative territory for December, traditionally one of its strongest months.The financial sector of the S&P 500 recovered ground after Monday’s sell-off. Bank of America climbed back above $5, a level that it had breached on Monday for the first time since 2009. BofA shares closed up 3.7 per cent to $5.17.Morgan Stanley climbed 4.5 per cent to $14.80 and Citigroup was up 4.6 per cent at $25.95.Jefferies surged 22.9 per cent to $14.50, its highest close since October, as the investment bank revealed quarterly earnings that were not as bad as expected.Profit fell to $63m, 23 per cent lower than last year, but many analysts had expected worse. The bank faced intense scrutiny of its exposure to eurozone sovereign bonds in November, but fees from investment advisory services rose year on year.“The results are better than expected but the share price reaction is overdone,” said Douglas Sipkin at Ticonderoga Securities.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 2.9 per cent to 12,103.43 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.2 per cent to 2,603.73.AT&T lagged behind the market, but was still up 1.3 per cent to $29.01, despite calling time on its attempt to acquire T Mobile USA.That was a fillip for its equipment suppliers. Juniper Networks climbed 8.9 per cent to $19.74 and F5 Networks was up 6.7 per cent to $109.39.“We believe this development is a short-term positive for equipment vendors,” said George Notter at Jefferies. “We believe that AT&T in recent months had significantly dialled back fourth-quarter spending in order to apply leverage in its fight with regulators.”Rival network Sprint Nextel also took cheer, closing up 9.3 per cent to $2.36.BlackBerry handset manufacturer Research In Motion suffered another day of heavy selling.Shares fell 2.9 per cent to $12.52, the latest losses apparently triggered by reports that as many as 5,000 of its PlayBook tablets had been stolen from a freight truck.CVS Caremark rose 8.9 per cent to $39.80. The pharmacy chain boosted its quarterly dividend to 16.25 cents a share from 12.5 cents a share.Eastman Chemical jumped 8.1 per cent to $38.70 after announcing it had broken ground on a new facility to produce acetate in China.Red Hat fell 8.9 per cent to $41.95 for the worst performance in the S&P 500. The open-source software company reported fiscal third-quarter billings that missed analysts’ estimates.Billings, a predictor of revenue, increased 23 per cent from a year earlier in the three months to the end of November.Cruise ship operator Carnival Corporation was one of the other five S&P 500 stocks to fall.

American has called time on attempts to renegotiate pension and benefit costs with pilots.Semiconductor manufacturer Corning suffered heavy selling after unexpectedly lowering fourth quarter sales guidance.The stock fell 10.8 per cent to $13.19, as the company said sales of a major LCD screen product will rise only 5 to 10 per cent quarter on quarter, compared to prior guidance of a 20 per cent sequential rise.Hospira fell 9.1 per cent to $28.17 after RBC Capital Markets said a long running Food and Drug Administration investigation into the medical device marker’s main manufacturing plant may cause “widespread” production breakdowns, and take two to three years to correct.Netflix fell 3.4 per cent to $67.57 after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the company’s debt another notch, citing the risks involved in the video streaming website’s capital intensive overseas expansion.Home Depot was the standout performer in the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones. Shares rose 5.3 per cent to $38.96 after the company’s chief financial officer told an analyst breakfast meeting that November sales had been better than expected.Hard-drive manufacturers Western Digital climbed 4.7 per cent to $27.80.The company was following on the coat tails of rival Seagate Technology, which was up 3.7 per cent to $16.58, after releasing a positive update to fourth-quarter guidance, even as widespread flooding in Thailand wreaks havoc with supply chains.“[Seagate’s] guidance update was driven by increasing industry-wide prices [for hard drives] rather than anything company specific,” said Joe Yoo at Citigroup.Mr Yoo said rising prices should reduce Western Digital’s fourth quarter net loss to roughly $150m, compared to the company’s most recent guidance of $300m.Banks gave back some of their gains from Monday’s rally.Morgan Stanley fell 3.6 per cent to $13.31, leaving the investment bank up just 0.4 per cent for the week, significantly underperforming the S&P 500, which is up almost 3 per cent.Bank of America was down 3.2 per cent to $5.08, after touching a new year low of $5.03 during the day.But Nomura analyst Brian Foran gave bank executives some cheer, arguing retrenchment by European lenders from the US markets could benefit midsize US banks.“This creates an opportunity for US banks such as US Bancorp, PNC and Wells Fargo who are big enough to serve large corporate borrowers and are now able to replace Europeans as they pull out,” Mr Foran wrote to clients.PNC was up 1.2 per cent to $50.83.

He allegedly had become intrigued by al-Qaeda through reading about the terrorist group online and had hoped to travel to Yemen for terrorism training.At a news conference on Sunday evening, Michael Bloomberg, New York’s mayor, said Mr Pimentel was acting alone and that police took him into custody on Saturday when it became clear that he was close to testing a bomb in a mailbox outside of New York City. Mr Bloomberg said the suspect hoped to target US military personnel returning from war.“The suspect was a so-called ‘lone wolf’ motivated by his own resentment about the presence of US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan,” Mr Bloomberg said.Ray Kelly, New York’s police commissioner, said that Mr Pimentel had learnt how to build bombs by reading Inspire magazine, an online publication distributed by al-Qaeda. He said that the suspect had purchased materials such as nails and pipe “elbows” from retail stores such as Home Depot.“The public will know there are Mujahideen in the city to fight jihad here,” Mr Kelly quoted Mr Pimentel as saying.Mr Pimentel was described as a US citizen who was born in the Dominican Republic and spent most of his life living in Manhattan. Police said he had lived in Schenectady, New York, for five years before returning to Manhattan and that he was recently separated from his wife.Mr Kelly said that the suspect accelerated his plan after the death of Mr al-Awlaki and that in online forums had discussed changing his name to Osama Hussein in honour of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.Mr Pimentel is charged with conspiring to build a bomb for purposes of terrorism and possessing a weapon intended for violence.
139;HD;Home Depot;2011-11-18T00:19:17Z;HP adds activist investor Whitworth to board;;Hewlett-Packard has added activist shareholder Ralph Whitworth to its board rather than risk more public conflict as it tries to bring 15 months of turmoil to a close.Mr Whitworth is understood to have been among the investors who faulted HP for paying a 79 per cent premium for UK software company Autonomy this year and for its just-abandoned exploration of spinning off its personal computer division, the world’s largest by volume.“HP has an extraordinarily valuable global franchise, and I look forward to working closely with my fellow directors and HP’s management team”, Mr Whitworth said in a statement from the board.Though its membership has changed, the divided board has come under repeated fire since last year. Many investors objected back then to the company’s firing of chief executive Mark Hurd, who had driven the revenue and stock higher, in the wake of a sex harassment claim that a board inquiry did not bear out.HP and Mr Whitworth negotiated an agreement that includes a two-year stint on the board and a promise by his Relational Investors not to engage in a proxy fight or acquire more than 9.9 per cent of HP’s stock. The San Diego-based firm must maintain at least 0.5 per cent of its shares, which had lost more than half their value between Mr Hurd’s August 2010 dismissal and last month.The board last year replaced Mr Hurd with European software executive Léo Apotheker, who announced the Autonomy deal and proposed PC spin-off, only to fire him after 10 months.The HP directors failed to end the confusion immediately in September by appointing one of their own, Meg Whitman, the former Ebay chief executive, to succeed Mr Apotheker.Director Ray Lane, who at that point became executive chairman of HP, said after the US markets closed on Thursday that Mr Whitworth “will bring a constructive voice and a track record of value creation into the boardroom”. The board also named two-year director Rajiv Gupta, a veteran in the materials industry, as lead independent director.Mr Lane organised the effort to oust Mr Apotheker after hearing from many HP investors. The appointment of Mr Whitworth suggests that he has not finished appeasing them.Mr Whitworth already this year unveiled activist holdings in L-3, the defence company he believes should reconsider its mix of businesses. He also has served on the board of Genzyme, the biotech company sold to Sanofi-Aventis this year for more than $20bn.In 2008, he challenged Bob Nardelli, the chief executive of Home Depot, on his pay and performance, leading to the CEO’s departure from the retailer.

Varian was up 6.2 per cent to $60.60 after JPMorgan analysts told clients the German conglomerate Siemens would exit radiation therapy treatments, allowing Varian to gain market share.The S&P 500 finished the day at 1,257.81, on solid gains of 0.5 per cent. Trading had been volatile until midday when news that Italian prime minister-designate Mario Monti may form a government as soon as Wednesday triggered a decisive rally.“US markets have been given a reprieve for now,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “But that could be reversed in a second if there is bad news from Europe.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 1,257.81.The Nasdaq Composite index gained 2.1 per cent to 2,686.2, with support from Apple, by far its most heavily weighted stock.Apple shares rose 2.5 per cent to $388.83 after ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall told clients he expected the company to initiate a dividend policy next year.

a host of bellwether retail names falling on results releases.Walmart was off 2.4 per cent to $57.46 despite reporting US sales growth for the first time in nine quarters.Sales were driven by discounting that hurt margins, driving profit 3 per cent lower than in the same quarter of 2010 to $3.3bn.“Walmart investors have become accustomed to earnings beats,” said David Shick, head of consumer research at Stifel Nicolaus. “But the company is correct to focus on expanding market share at the expense of the bottom line in the short term.”Walmart’s size and exposure to thrifty consumers have made it a favourite of defensive investors this year and it remains one of the best performers in the S&P 500.Urban Outfitters fell sharply in early trading, before riding the afternoon rally, to end the day up 0.1 per cent to $26.85. Many analysts were alarmed by the level of unsold inventory held at the quarter’s end, a concern that Jeff Black at Citigroup played down.“The stance to the end of the fourth quarter with inventory better aligned with sales reinforces our view that Urban’s margin trough is confined to the second half of 2011,” Mr Black wrote to clients.Office equipment store Staples fell 3.6 per cent to $14.81 on anaemic sales growth of just 0.5 per cent compared with the same quarter last year. Barclays Capital analysts noted, however, that in local currency terms revenue was up 7 per cent year on year.Home Depot was down 0.5 per cent to $38.07 despite beating analyst expectations with earnings per share of 60 cents. Sears Holdings dropped 3.1 per cent to $70.03 after its Canadian namesake – in which it holds a 90 per cent stake – posted a loss of C$45.8m.The focus on retailers took the heat off bank stocks with the financial sector of the S&P 500 gaining 0.4 per cent, despite another sharp rise in the yields of Italian and Spanish sovereign bonds.Citigroup fell 1.3 per cent to $28.02 on reports that a host of hedge fund investors, including John Paulson, had cut their stakes in the bank during the third quarter.High-profile investor flight also hurt professional networking website LinkedIn, which slipped 4.8 per cent to $74.86, on news Bain Capital will sell its entire stake of 3.71m shares, when the newly floated company’s lock-out period ends.PepsiCo was boosted by news that activist investor Nelson Peltz has taken a $146m stake. The stock was up 2.7 per cent to $64.50 on hopes that Mr Peltz will push the board to boost shareholder returns.Quanta Services climbed 2.2 per cent to $19.19, on renewed hope that the Keystone XL pipeline, for which Quanta has a lucrative service contract, will be given the go-ahead if the state of Nebraska’s environmental concerns can be addressed.The hard drive manufacturer Western Digital Corporation slipped 4.9 per cent to $25.05 as the open-ended impact of widespread flooding in Thailand on its factories led another analyst to downgrade the stock."
141;HD;Home Depot;2011-11-15T19:24:08Z;US retail: box of tricks;Positive months run to 10 and what companies are reporting fits the picture;When Santa comes tumbling down the chimney of the US economy, retailers will be eager to see how much growth is in his bag. Government data and recent company results both tell the same story: while the good children may get their toys, there will also be plenty of ugly sweaters and socks for the naughty.American retail sales for October, released on Tuesday, grew 0.5 per cent sequentially – impressive coming on top of a strong September number, and ahead of expectations. The string of positive months now runs to 10, and easy comparisons should keep the streak alive at least through year’s end. In absolute terms this is weak growth, of course, but the numbers do not suggest that things are getting worse.What companies are reporting fits with this picture. There is demand out there, but it is not coming easy. Most significantly, Walmart on Tuesday reported same-store sales growth at its US stores for the first time in two years – but operating margins dropped as the company held the line on passing cost increases to customers while expanding its selection to attract shoppers. Meanwhile, same-store sales at Home Depot were up more than 4 per cent year on year and operating margins widened by half a percentage point. This success seems to be coming out of the hide of their competitor Lowe’s, however, which had much softer results.There is a similar dynamic in clothing retail, with strong players hanging tough (both high-end department store Saks and brand-name discounter TJX Companies reported respectable numbers), while chains that are not leaders in their niche (JC Penney, Urban Outfitters) are seeing flat-to-down sales and severe margin compression.There will be shiny boxes under the tree this year but the contents will vary.
142;HD;Home Depot;2011-11-09T00:07:07Z;Apple introduces DIY check-out by mobile app;;Apple has simplified shopping at its bricks-and-mortar stores by introducing new ordering and payment methods that underscore its credentials as a pacesetter in retail innovation.The technology group, which is influencing retail after transforming computing, music and mobile phones, on Tuesday made it possible for customers to pick up online orders in a store and introduced a self-check out facility.The changes, which were made via updates to its online shopping app, will accelerate the way mobile communications technology is blurring the boundary between online and offline retail.“Just as Amazon set the tone online, Apple is starting to set the tone on in-store experience and other retailers will be inspired to follow,” said Cathy Halligan, a former chief marketing officer at Walmart.com.But Gale Daikoku, Gartner retail technology analyst, said Apple’s moves did not herald a dramatic change because of security concerns and customers’ general preference for dealing with other human beings.“This is a really cool thing,” she said. “Is it something we will see massively adopted? I don’t think anytime soon.”The self-check out facility, called EasyPay, lets customers buy accessories less valuable than computers and phones without any direct contact with an Apple employee, a process that some other retailers remain wary of due to worries about theft.Consumers who are logged into an Apple account on their smartphone can scan the bar code of a product in a store and buy it using the credit card linked to that account.Apple said store employees could ask to see the electronic receipts that will be loaded on to smartphones during the transactions.Self-check out facilities that take cash or credit cards were pioneered by grocery stores in order to speed up check out queues and reduce staffing costs.Mike Gatti, executive director of marketing at the National Retail Federation, said: “This is Apple taking it to the next level, using the mobile device with your payment information in the cloud. It’s going to be the mobile wallet.”The in-store pick up facility lets consumers use the Apple Store app to search the inventory of nearby stores for the item they want, order and pay for it online, then pick it up in person as soon as one hour later.“Consumers want convenience and they want to make sure there is no wasted trip to the stores,” said Ms Halligan, who is now senior vice-president of sales and marketing at PowerReviews, a social commerce company.Retailers that already allow in-store pick up, such as Walmart and Home Depot, say it is also popular with customers who do not want to wait for an online purchase to be delivered.Target and other big retailers also have apps that let consumers scan bar codes to find product information, but they do not enable purchases.Ebay, the online marketplace, has begun to sell retailers services similar to those unveiled by Apple through its new X.commerce business, which includes the PayPal payments system and RedLaser, a barcode scanner.
143;HD;Home Depot;2011-11-06T19:08:02Z;Kingfisher to renovate Chinese DIY business;;Kingfisher, the home improvement retailer which owns the B&Q and Castorama chains, is poised to reshape its Chinese business in its latest bid to crack one of the world’s most difficult DIY markets.Ian Cheshire, chief executive, said the group planned to test a smaller version of its current “big box” format, and was considering a “design centre” format, by which customers could plan the interior for a whole apartment – then pay a workman to install it.“Big box DIY retail is not the model for China, so we’re going to try something else,” said Mr Cheshire. “If you can afford to buy the products, as a matter of class, you won’t get involved in their installation.”B&Q has already tested a showroom format inside one of its Shanghai stores, which features four complete life-size apartments, squarely aimed at what Mr Cheshire terms the “Do it For Me rather than Do it Yourself” market. If successful, this approach could be copied throughout Kingfisher’s 40 existing Chinese stores.“The Chinese don’t tend to do the small projects,” Mr Cheshire said on the mooted change of strategy. “You don’t paint up the bathroom over the weekend. They either do brand-new apartments fitted out from a concrete shell or, when they do refurbish their apartment, it’s once every 10 years.“You rip everything out, move out for three months, and you completely rebuild it down to the wiring and the plumbing.”Since entering the Chinese market in 1999, Kingfisher was forced to close 22 stores two years ago after the venture reported losses of £52m ($83m) in a single year. It has already trimmed the size of its remaining 40 stores by sub-letting space to other retailers, including Carrefour and Best Buy.A design centre format would not need to carry as much stock, because consumers typically order products six months in advance, potentially enabling more space to be sub-let.B&Q is not the only DIY chain to encounter difficulties in the Chinese market. Home Depot, the US home-improvement group, has closed 5 of its Chinese superstores during the past two years.
144;HD;Home Depot;2011-10-04T22:46:58Z;Republican presidential field narrows;;The field to challenge Barack Obama in 2012 looks settled after months of uncertainty and instability in Republican ranks following the decision by Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, to stay out of the race.Mr Christie was the latest of a number of potential candidates to fall by the wayside – as in the case of developer Donald Trump – or off the pace – as with Representative Michele Bachmann – in the competition to be the Republican nominee.Sarah Palin, the last remaining significant outlier in Republican ranks, has made no steps to build the type of organisation needed to run for president and is considered highly unlikely to run.At a news conference in Trenton, the state capital, Mr Christie said he was flattered by the approaches to run for president but did not want to leave the job of New Jersey governor after serving for less than two years.“It just never felt right to leave New Jersey, so I didn’t,” he said.He said he wanted Mr Obama to be a one-term president “because he had failed the test of leadership” but declined to endorse any of the Republican challengers.Mr Christie was backed by a brace of wealthy Republican business leaders unsatisfied with the current field, including Paul Singer, the hedge fund manager, and Kenneth Langone, a founder of Home Depot.For many mainstream Republicans, Rick Perry, the Texas governor who briefly became the favourite after announcing his candidacy last month, has positioned himself too far on the frontiers of policy by attacking the Federal Reserve and Social Security.Many Republicans have also made a concerted effort to find an alternative to Mitt Romney, the other leading candidate. But throughout, the former Massachusetts governor has run a disciplined and effective campaign while his rivals have faltered, and he is already picking up Mr Christie’s supporters.Mr Langone would now be supporting Mr Romney, the businessman’s spokesman, Jim McCarthy, said.Some Republicans will be wistful about Mr Christie’s decision, with a poll conducted on Monday showing him tied with Mr Romney in a poll of Republican voters and even with Mr Obama in a general election.“This survey shows Governor Christie is walking away from the possibility – at least today – to be elected president of the US,” said Peter Brown of the Quinnipiac University polling institute, which conducted the survey.
145;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T02:20:01+0000;Republicans look to New Jersey governor;;"Some Wall Street titans and influential Republican donors turned off their televisions and picked up their telephones following last week’s shaky debate performance by Rick Perry, the presumed frontrunner in their party’s race for the presidential nomination.On the receiving end was Chris Christie, the tough-talking governor of New Jersey who has repeatedly said he is not interested in running to replace Barack Obama in the White House. But he is nevertheless seen by a cadre of powerful party and business leaders as the best man for the job. He has been the object of speculation in the past, but it resurfaced in the wake of Mr Perry’s uncertain performance in the last week.“Nothing fundamentally has changed about the effort, except the intensity of the recruitment and the calibre of the people is much higher,” says one former strategist for Mr Christie who asked not to be named because he did not want to be seen as encouraging the idea that the governor might run.According to reports, the effort to push Mr Christie into running has been led by Kenneth Langone, a founder of Home Depot, hedge fund mogul Paul Singer, and conservative activist and industrialist David Koch, among others.The fact that such a high profile group of Republicans would settle on Mr Christie, a relative newcomer to politics, speaks volumes about the unease with which many in the Republican field view their current slate of choices. Mr Christie, a former US attorney, has been a rising star since 2008, when he beat former Democratic governor Jon Corzine, the former chief of Goldman Sachs.Charles Schwab

Backed former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani’s campaign for president in 2008* Forbes magazine estimatesMr Perry, the firebrand governor of Texas, generated intense excitement when he first announced his bid in August and remains a frontrunner in polls. But polls also show that the staunchly conservative Texan would not fare as well against Mr Obama as the number two contender for the nomination, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.Unlike Mr Perry, who has been hammered by scathing critiques from Republican pundits for his less-than-sharp debate performances, Mr Romney seems to have become a stronger candidate in recent weeks.But there are big questions about whether the former Bain executive, who has been running for president since 2007, can overcome some of the problems dogging his candidacy. These include his passage of healthcare reform as governor that is similar to Mr Obama’s overhaul, which is loathed by Republicans, and uncertainty about his Mormon faith. Mr Romney is also an establishment candidate for a party whose most energetic wing has taken a decidedly anti-establishment turn.For some Republicans, Mr Christie is attractive not only because of the record he has as a straight talking – some say bullying – cost-cutter who was willing to take on his state’s labour unions, but because he is seen as a leader.But some Washington insiders say the hand-wringing over the apparent lack of solid candidates has been overblown.Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman, says his party has been trying out “flavours of the month”, but that ultimately it is likely that Mr Romney will be the only candidate that is found to be “edible”. Once Republicans settle on a nominee, he says, the intensity of the desire to replace Mr Obama will unify voters around the candidate.“When you get that nomination, you give a speech to millions, you can be elevated very quickly,” says Mr Davis. He points to Bill Clinton, who as a relatively unknown governor of Arkansas did not immediately win the confidence of his Democrats in 1992. But he went on to be a two-term president.Even if Mr Christie were to join the race, it is far from clear how well a Republican from a “blue” northern state would fare once his full record was vetted by ultraconservatives. Mr Christie has supported gun control laws and is seen by today’s Republican standards as moderate on immigration and environmental issues. He opposes abortion and same-sex marriage but is not seen as a hardline conservative on social issues.Ultimately, the buzz around Mr Christie – who has stated in the past that he did not believe he was ready for the presidency – says more about the pitfalls facing Mr Perry and Mr Romney than the likelihood that the next US president will hail from New Jersey."
146;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Amazon relents to online sales tax;;Amazon will begin collecting sales tax in California starting late next year, after it struck a compromise deal with lawmakers to delay tax collection by a year in return for abandoning the company’s referendum campaign against the levy.The world’s biggest online retailer has been fighting efforts by several states to force online retailers to collect sales tax from online shoppers who, in most cases, have not had to pay it since the birth of e-commerce. Traditional retailers complain that has given Amazon an unfair advantage.In California, the US’s most populous state and home to Silicon Valley, Amazon faced its most formidable challenge and in July it boldly called for a referendum against lawmakers’ move to modify tax law to capture online retail.But in a deal struck with lawmakers this week, Amazon softened its position and agreed to start collecting sales tax next September.If the online retailer begins collecting tax next year, it will be seen as an important victory for traditional rivals such as Walmart, Home Depot and Best Buy, which have lobbied hard against what they say is a tax loophole as they leech sales to internet-only retailers.Amazon, which denies its business success depends on the tax exemption even though it fought hard against it, sought to put a positive spin on the deal.Paul Misener, Amazon’s vice-president of global public policy, said in a statement: “This bipartisan, win-win legislation will allow Amazon to bring thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of investment dollars to California, and welcome back to work tens of thousands of California-based advertising affiliates.”The US does not have a federal tax law on e-commerce and many states do not require online retailers to collect tax if they do not have a physical presence those states. California is the eighth US state to modify such laws in order to tax online commerce.Amazon has said it supports a single national tax solution for online commerce, although its actions have left critics doubting its sincerity.Mr Misener said: “This [California] legislation also will allow us to continue to work with [the US] congress and the states to obtain a federal resolution to the sales tax issue as soon as possible.”
147;HD;Home Depot;2011-08-18T22:16:48Z;Gap and Sears struggle to revive images;;Weak quarterly results from Gap and Sears Holdings underlined the challenges facing US retailers that have been struggling to revive their images at a time when consumers are already being cautious.Gap, the largest US apparel company by revenues, said on Thursday that its second-quarter net income fell 19 per cent to $189m, or 35 cents a share. The company has been unable to pass along commodity cost increases to its customers and efforts to update its merchandise have so far failed to increase sales.US same-store sales at Gap’s namesake outlets were down 3 per cent year on year, while sales at its Banana Republic stores slipped 2 per cent and sales at Old Navy were flat. Glenn Murphy, chief executive, acknowledged that the quarter was “difficult” and expressed frustration that his stores have not been drawing enough traffic.Earlier this year, Gap replaced the head of the North America Gap brand and appointed a new creative director, in hopes of finding fashion trends with better appeal to young people and women. Mr Murphy said he still hoped to see noticeable improvement in the results by the holiday shopping season.Meanwhile, Sears Holdings reported a wider quarterly loss on Thursday, as customers flocked to its rivals in search of bigger bargains and better service.The company, which runs Sears and Kmart stores, also announced another round of jobs cuts. It said it would sack 250 workers, two months after it cut 700 jobs.Sears has been hit hard by the weak US economy and analysts have criticised its strategy of shutting stores and discounting heavily. They say the company, which sells everything from clothing to electrical appliances, has struggled to compete with rivals offering lower prices and better service.In the second quarter, the company reported a loss of $146m, or $1.37 a share. That followed a loss of $39m, or 35 cents, in the same period a year ago and sent Sears’ share price down 8.2 per cent to $555.23 on Thursday.“We are not satisfied with our results and are taking actions to turn round our performance in a challenging economic environment,” Lou D’Ambrosio, chief executive of Sears Holdings, said in a statement.Weakness at Sears Holdings has persisted since 2005, when billionaire Edward Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in a $11.9bn deal.The company’s sales have fallen each year since as competitors such as Walmart, Target and Home Depot have invested in their stores and grabbed market share. Sales slid again in the second quarter, declining by 1.2 per cent to $10.3bn.“They have underinvested in stores, they have cut service levels and consumers are saying that the asking price for their products is not worth it for the level of service they get,” said Gary Balter, retail analyst at Credit Suisse.Sears Holdings took a $48m charge from the closing of 29 stores this year. Mr D’Ambrosio said that shrinking profit margins were due to markdowns and promotions that were needed to clear inventory.Rather than invest in its stores, Sears Holdings has been focused on improving its online presence and creating brands, such as the Kardashian Kollection.Mr Balter said sales driven through clearances were “not the solution to Sears problems”, and that its poor customer service was depleting the value of its strong brands, such as Kenmore and Craftsman.In a letter to investors in February, Mr Lampert argued that upgrading stores was just one part of becoming a “go-to” retailer, and that “emerging” areas such as online and rewards programmes were more important.“Our decisions to allocate capital in these areas are based on the expected future performance of the investments without worrying about the quarter-to-quarter reporting consequences,” he said.

But he did not recommend buying the shares, despite the falling price, citing “our belief that more defensive names will likely outperform”.Dell dragged down rival computer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard, which lost 3.7 per cent to close at $31.39. Tech stocks were the worst performing of the S&P 500 index sectors, down 0.9 per cent.Analysts suggested manufacturers of tablets and netbooks would benefit from Dell’s troubles over the longer term but Apple, maker of the iPad tablet, saw its shares fall marginally to $380.44.Earlier, shares rose more than 1 per cent as traders shrugged off a 0.2 per cent month-on-month increase in producer prices in July, which stoked fears of inflation. The rise in producer prices was 0.4 per cent excluding food and energy prices, the highest since January.But a rally faded into the close, and the broad S&P 500 index closed up just 0.1 per cent at 1,193.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up fractionally at 11,410.21, but the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 2,511.48.Bob Haber, the principal of Haber Trilix advisers said today’s volatility could be the shape of things to come. “People don’t know how far a rally is going to go so it is very tempting to sell after small rises to lock in gains”A positive earnings report from Target had given some early lift to sentiment. The US’s second-largest discount retailer posted earnings of $1.03 a share, beating expectations of 97 cents a share. Its shares were up 2.4 per cent to $50.55 after paring early gains.That followed positive data from Home Depot and Walmart on Tuesday. Consumer staples performed well for a second day running, rising 0.8 per cent.But, shares in some retailers were falling sharply. Abercrombie & Fitch beat analyst expectations with earnings of 35 cents a share but its shares slumped 8.7 per cent to $64.87.Erika Maschmeyer, an analyst at Baird, said traders were unimpressed by the company’s refusal to discuss how much the poor economic environment will weight on revenue growth next year, but she expected the shares to recover in value by the end of the month.Telecom shares were the best performing sector on the S&P 500. Sprint shares continued to rise in the afterglow of Google’s bid for Motorola Mobility, with some traders predicting Google might bid for the network next. Sprint was up 3.6 per cent to $3.72 on the day, up 16 per cent for the week.Verizon and AT&T rose 2.1 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively as yield-seeking investors sought stocks which will pay reliable dividends.Shares in Tudou, a Chinese streaming video website, fell in their first day of trading after pricing an initial public offering late on Tuesday. The shares opened on the Nasdaq at $31. The stock finished 7.4 per cent lower at $26.85. “We cannot time the market,” said Gary Wang, Tudou chief executive. “But long-term investors like our story a lot. Fundamentally, it’s a play on the size of the Chinese consumer market and our focus on entertainment video is especially appealing to young consumers.”The pricing offered hopes that the IPO market could be thawing after freezing during the market volatility earlier in August but investors still appeared to be skittish. Tudou was forced to price its offering at an almost 60 per cent discount to rival Youku, whose shares were up 10.7 per cent to $26.47 on Wednesday.Cigarette manufacturers rose on news that a group of companies led by Lorillard are suing the US government over planned graphic health warnings on cigarette packaging. Lorillard was up 3.1 per cent at $108.38. Philip Morris International gained 2 per cent to close at $69.06.
149;HD;Home Depot;2011-08-16T20:17:26Z;Home Depot lifts outlook after sales rise;;Home Depot, the biggest US home improvement retailer by turnover, lifted its outlook for full-year profit for the second time this year as stronger sales pushed its quarterly earnings above Wall Street estimates.Income rose 13.5 per cent to $1.36bn, or 86 cents a share, in the three months ending July 31, from $1.19bn, or 72 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. The results were ahead of estimates of 82 cents a share.The company outpaced rival Lowe’s, which cut its earnings outlook on Monday after missing its second-quarter sales estimates. A decline in comparable store sales left the second-largest home improvement retailer’s profits nearly flat at $830m, or 64 cents a share.Lowe’s has struggled to maintain sales growth as US consumers have shied away from expensive renovation projects and costly appliance purchases amid a weak economy plagued by high unemployment and a troubled housing market.“The volume of negative news and the unsettling impact on equity markets is having a significant effect on already fragile consumer mindset,” Robert Niblock, Lowe’s chief executive, told analysts on Monday. “Even after taking into account the challenge of the macro environment, we’re still not pleased with our performance this year.”Home Depot, in contrast, has more readily weathered the decline in consumer sentiment and the poor health of the property sector by cutting costs, offering sales promotions and emphasising its less expensive products.“We do not expect any meaningful improvement in the housing market for the back half of 2011 and events here and across the globe would suggest that there are more risks to the downside than the upside on [gross domestic product] growth. But both of those conditions were also true for the first half and we saw steady strength in the core of our store,” said Frank Blake, chief executive.Home Depot’s second-quarter results were boosted by rebounding sales of seasonal outdoor products, storm-related repairs, and strength in Home Depot’s core building materials, kitchen, garden, tools and electrical segments, Mr Blake said.The company lifted its full-year profit forecast to $2.34 a share from its earlier guidance of $2.24. Sales are expected to rise 2.5 per cent this year. Lowe’s lowered its yearly outlook to earnings of $1.48 to $1.54 a share.As Americans bought materials to repair their homes after harsh winter weather in northern states and devastating tornadoes that ripped across the south in the spring, Home Depot sales rose 4.2 per cent in the second quarter to $20.2bn from $19.4bn. Sales at stores open at least a year were up 4.3 per cent, ahead of analysts’ estimates, and US same-store sales rose 3.5 per cent in the quarter. Transactions rose 1.1 per cent and the value of the average sale was up 3.3 per cent.Shares in Home Depot rose 5.3 per cent to $33.12 on Tuesday in New York. Lowe’s shares regained early losses, rising 2.1 per cent to $20.09.

Bank of America closed at $7.40 and Citigroup at $29.94. Overall, financial stocks were down almost 2 per cent.Although the stock market has calmed this week, the S&P 500 index remains more than 5 per cent down for the year.On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also down 0.7 per cent at 11405.93 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.2 per cent to 2523.45.Consumer staples was the only sector of the S&P 500 not to record a fall, thanks to strong earnings reports from large US retailers.Home Depot led a small group of advancers in the S&P 500, gaining 5.3 per cent to close at $33.12.The housing goods retailer earned 86 cents a share versus forecasts of 82.4 cents and raised its forecast for full-year earnings to $2.34 per share from $2.24.Frank Blake, chief executive, was cautious, saying strong sales were driven in part by a one-time boost due to floods and storms throughout the US during the second quarter.David Strasser of Janney Capital Markets said Home Depot had benefited from weak results announced by its rival Lowe’s yesterday. Mr Stresser expects the company to continue to gain market share from its rival.Walmart also beat earnings forecasts to report $1.09 a share compared with expectations of $1.08. Its shares added 3.9 per cent to end the day at $51.92.Though Walmart’s same-store sales declined for the ninth consecutive quarter and its chief executive warned of pressures on customers, it raised its 2012 earnings guidance to as much as $4.51 a share from $4.41.Barclays Capital’s Robert Drbul, whose target price of $62 a share is above the Wall Street consensus, said the company’s proved ability to deliver cost savings more than made up for falling same-store sales.But shares of Urban Outfitters, a clothing retailer, fell 6.3 per cent to $27.84 after same-store sales declined versus a year ago, the largest non-financial decline on the S&P 500.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets lowered their price target on Urban Outfitters from $38 to $35 a share but still recommended holding the shares, saying they “continued to view [it] as an attractive turnround story”.Marshall Edwards, the San Diego-based medical company, was the biggest gainer of the Nasdaq Composite index. Its shares rose almost 40 per cent to $1.91 after the Food and Drug Administration approved its application to trial a new cancer drug.Gilead Sciences was up 4.2 per cent to $38.85. Analysts at JPMorgan said the shares were “de-risked” following the approval of a new drug and strong testing results for another. They said the current price did not reflect the potential of those two drugs, which could result in as much as $23 a share’s worth of earnings.Shares in Google continued to fall after its announcement of a $12.5bn bid for Motorola Mobility, slipping 3.3 per cent to $539.Standard & Poor’s Equity Research cut Google to sell from buy recommendation, and reduced its target price to $500, arguing “the purchase of [Motorola Mobility] would negatively impact growth, margins and balance sheet.”Mobility’s shares closed at $38.02, close to Google’s $40-a-share bid.Stock in Sprint rose for a second day. The telecoms group was up 3.2 per cent at $3.59 amid speculation that Google might seek to acquire a network, as well as a handset manufacturer.News Corp shares gained 1.4 per cent to close at $17.14. But earlier in the day they had traded close to the $18 last seen before phone hacking allegations in the UK engulfed the company. Allegations resurfaced in London in the afternoon, reversing the shares’ rise.
151;HD;Home Depot;2011-08-14T15:15:42Z;Caterpillar builds on solid China foundation;;"When Caterpillar, the world’s largest producer of earth-moving equipment, opened its first joint venture in China in 1994, the country was still among the poorest in the world in terms of gross domestic product per capita, and bicycles, not cars, dominated the streets of Beijing and Shanghai. Fast forward to today, when China is the world’s biggest market for machinery, accounting for about 9 per cent of Caterpillar’s annual revenues.While many global brands have struggled in China’s consumer sector, Caterpillar has been relatively successful so far in maintaining its grip on China’s premium machinery market. A string of recent high-profile pullbacks by multinationals include Mattel’s closure of its flagship Barbie store in Shanghai, along with store closures by Best Buy and Home Depot.Unlike the consumer sector, the heavy machinery sector has largely rewarded foreign companies – like Caterpillar and Japanese rival Komatsu – that offer better quality at higher prices than their domestic peers.Today Caterpillar has about a 7 per cent market share in China, and in recent years the company has become more focused on China, relocating group president Richard Lavin to Hong Kong last winter. Caterpillar even took the unusual step of issuing renminbi-denominated bonds in Hong Kong last year, to raise funds for its leasing business in China.“Our strategy is very straightforward, in support of the corporate strategy. We have got to win in China,” Mr Lavin told an industry conference in March.There is tough competition, however, from Chinese rivals, who have gained market share in recent years from their foreign peers through aggressive marketing, attractive financing and improving technology. In the highly-prized excavator market, one of the fastest growing, Caterpillar’s market share has fallen to 7 per cent from 10 per cent five years ago, according to figures from consultancy Off-Highway Research.Chinese heavy machinery makers – a group that includes groups such as Sany Heavy, Zoomlion, Xugong and Shantui – have excelled at wooing new customers through aggressive promotion by dealerships, says Shi Yang at Off-Highway Research. Some dealerships give buyers raffle tickets to win a Mercedes or a BMW car; others offer financing incentives like zero down payment. The technology gap between Chinese companies and their foreign peers is also diminishing.Coming months are set to put some Chinese machinery makers to the test though, as demand for construction equipment in China falls on the back of a weakening real estate sector. Analysts and industry executives expect a period of consolidation for Chinese equipment makers that will eventually produce a handful of clear leaders.Meanwhile, a handful of larger Chinese groups are already vying for global dominance with ambitious expansion plans overseas. Shantui, one of the world’s biggest makers of bulldozers, last week launched a new subsidiary in Dubai as a gateway to the Middle East and north Africa. Sany Heavy, which makes a range of equipment including excavators and concrete pumps, is set to complete its US headquarters and a manufacturing site in Peachtree, Georgia, later this year.“I wouldn’t be surprised to see Chinese companies acquire overseas companies and build up manufacturing overseas,” said Edmond Huang, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “They are already doing things in Brazil, America and Germany that have made them closer to the market.”Caterpillar says one of its greatest challenges is building up its supply chain in China; the company’s production capacity has recently lagged behind the growing demand. Finding managerial talent is also a key challenge in China, Mr Lavin told the Financial Times last year.Despite these headwinds, Caterpillar’s story in China has been much happier than that of many foreign multinationals. In the area of high speed rail for example, Germany’s Siemens and Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries have seen their technology “digested” by Chinese train companies. In the technology sector, many foreign firms have been hamstrung by regulatory barriers.Caterpillar believes part of its success is that customers are willing to pay more for products that are more reliable. “In our industry, thankfully, the most important thing to customers when they buy a product is what that product earns them over its lifetime,” said Mike DeWalt, director of investor relations, in June, citing Caterpillar’s support for its equipment as a big advantage. “There were probably some product categories where the Chinese and the Koreans today can be more successful. And that’s probably in areas of the market that don’t require as much service support.”"

The sector as a whole was stronger by 6 per cent, its best day since May 2009, versus a nearly 10 per cent decline on Monday, its worst one-day fall since December 2008.Banks stepped in to soothe concerns that their balance sheets would be challenged by the economic slowdown and falling interest rates. Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, on Monday said that it was “concerned” that banks’ falling revenues could challenge their credit ratings, though it said it was not directly related to the agency’s downgrade of the US’s sovereign credit.Bruce Thompson, Bank of America’s chief financial officer, told analysts at Nomura on Tuesday that the company did not see a need to raise capital. Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr wrote that the “sell-off in Bank of America seems overdone”.Vikram Pandit, chief executive of Citigroup, told his executives on Tuesday that conditions presently were “fundamentally different” than in 2008, citing Citi’s efforts to raise capital and maintain liquidity. The shares added 14 per cent to $31.82.Analysts at FBR Capital Markets upgraded Wells Fargo, arguing that traders will “flock to quality names that can best weather the adverse effect of a flattening yield curve”. The shares rose 8.1 per cent to $24.78.“Risks of global financial contagion appear overdone,” said Mike Ryan, chief investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management. “US banks may struggle to find strong new revenue streams in the future, but we do not foresee an asset quality crisis.”Goldman Sachs lagged behind gains, rising 4.3 per cent to $122.73, after it reported that it saw poor trading results in the second quarter. It had 15 losing days out of 63 trading days, with gains of $100m on fewer than 5 days.S&P also downgraded clearing houses and insurers. Genworth Financial, the mortgage insurer, bounced back from a 17 per cent drop on Monday. The shares were up 14.4 per cent to $6.44.CME Group, the US futures market and clearing house, added 7.5 per cent to $266.05, versus an 8 per cent decline on Monday.The S&P 500 index wobbled but ended up gaining sharply in the wake of the Fed’s announcement of a hold on loose monetary policy until 2013. The index added 4.7 per cent to 1,172.53, its biggest one-day jump since March 2009, when the market was emerging from its post-crisis bottom.Large-cap stocks, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, underperformed in the upswing, a mirror of how they had previously been seeing less sharp losses than the broad index as investors rotated into defensive names. The Dow was up 4 per cent by the close to 11,239.77The Nasdaq Composite index, hit hard by a steep sell-off in small-cap stocks, had the sharpest gain, up 5.3 per cent to 2,482.52.The market’s breadth was unusually positive, with volumes of shares gaining outpacing volumes of shares falling by 2.2bn to 65m on the New York Stock Exchange.Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, said that in order for technical traders to confirm the move as a rally, rather than simply an interruption of a slide, the market would have to see advancers outpace decliners by at least 10-to-1 on Wednesday as well.“You expect the market to have rallies from time to time, but it is too risky to call a bottom,” Mr Bittles said.Consumer staples groups lagged behind gains, adding just 1.4 per cent. They suffered as investors shifted into more cyclical groups, and after analysts at Citigroup lowered their estimates for second-half same-store-sales growth at a group of large retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot.Their shares underperformed, but were still up 3.9 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively, boosted by Redbook reporting that US same-store sales rose 4.8 per cent in the week ending August 6.“Recent stock market volatility, elevated unemployment, increasing levels of inflation, waning consumer sentiment and a weak housing market will weigh on retail sales,” said Citi.Cablevision, the television and media group, fell 12.8 per cent to $17.02 after missing second-quarter profit forecasts, reporting income of 24 cents versus forecasts of 40 cents. It said it lost an unexpectedly large number of video customers.MEMC Electronic Materials, the semiconductor maker, led all gains in the S&P 500, adding 19 per cent to $5.93. It had hit a nine-year low on Monday.
153;HD;Home Depot;2011-07-13T23:05:38Z;Citigroup moves closer to credit card U-turn;;Citigroup is leaning toward keeping its private-label credit card arm, reversing course on a $41bn business the bank had marked for disposal in the wake of the financial crisis, people familiar with the matter said.The division, which issues cards on behalf of retailers such as Sears and Home Depot, had been shunted into the bank’s Citi Holdings unit for businesses, loans and investments that no longer fit with its strategy.Improving credit conditions and uncertainty shrouding the outlook for other consumer businesses, such as retail banking and mortgages, have prompted Citi executives to weigh shifting the private-label cards arm from Holdings to a place alongside the bank’s core credit-card operations, the people said.Citi’s new thinking also reflects the difficulties it may have encountered in selling the entire business at once, given banks’ reluctance to tackle large acquisitions and the challenges of financing the business as a stand-alone entity. Citi also would have had to compete for bidders with HSBC, which plans to sell its US credit-card operations.The people said Citi will wait until it sells its consumer-lending business, OneMain Financial, and sheds or runs off additional assets housed within Holdings before finalising its decision on the cards unit.The private-label card business has shrunk along with the rest of Citi Holdings. The unit had $41.3bn in loans at the end of the first quarter, down 24 per cent from a year earlier. Net credit losses fell by 18 per cent to $1.1bn in the first quarter from the last three months of 2010 and have dropped for seven straight periods.“Despite the significant increase in charge-offs during the recession, credit card loans remain one of the most financially lucrative asset classes within a bank’s portfolio,” Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analysts wrote this week.While balances on retail-store cards are typically less those of general cards, the private-label portfolios typically produce higher margins, Nomura analyst Brian Foran said.Nevertheless, Citi executives had been reluctant to change course, mindful that regulators might criticise any effort to undue decisions the bank made to stem losses and contain risk. The US government had injected $45bn in the lender during the crisis to stave off collapse.“As much as we have done to improve the overall portfolio, the retention of it would still mean we would have to first convince ourselves that the retail partner card business actually fit in with the Citicorp strategy,” John Gerspach, Citi’s chief financial officer, told analysts during an April conference call. “And that just is not a determination that we have made as of yet.”A Citi spokeswoman declined to comment.Citi has issued more than 33,000 retail partner card accounts, second only to General Electric, according to the Nilson Report.Citi had sold $1.6bn of the division’s managed assets to GE last year.
154;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Amazon urges California referendum on online tax;;Amazon, the world’s biggest online retailer, is set for a political fight in California after it called for a referendum on the state’s controversial move to tax online shopping.The call is likely to sharpen a confrontation between Amazon and bricks-and-mortar rivals including Walmart, Home Depot and Best Buy, which have backed moves to make online retailers collect sales tax from shoppers.California’s tax measure was included in the state budget passed last month as it struggles to reduce a $9.6bn deficit. Most US online shoppers do not pay sales tax, because the US does not have a federal tax law on e-commerce, but California is the eighth state to introduce a local tax.The sales tax issue is laying bare tensions between traditional retailers and online rivals that have been steadily grabbing market share from them in recent years.A referendum petition was filed last week by a California-based consultant who works for Amazon, which is itself based in Washington state.Paul Misener, Amazon’s vice-president of global public policy, presented the issue late on Monday as “a referendum on jobs and investment”, after Amazon announced last month that it would cut ties with online advertising partners in California to escape the tax.Mr Misener said in a statement: “We support this referendum against the recent sales tax legislation because, with unemployment at well over 11 per cent, Californians deserve a voice and a choice about jobs, investment and the state’s economic future.”A lobbying group representing bricks-and-mortar retailers, the Alliance for Main Street Fairness, quickly hit back at Amazon.“Amazon.com’s actions prove that the online-only retailer will say and do anything to maintain an unfair competitive advantage over brick-and-mortar businesses in California,” said Danny Diaz, spokesman for the alliance. “The lengths Amazon will go to evade collecting sales taxes – even spending tens of millions of dollars on a ballot referendum – should concern all Californians.”The alliance’s members complain that a tax loophole has given online retailers an unfair price advantage and are calling for “a level playing field”. They include Walmart, Home Depot and Best Buy as well as Target, Sears and JC Penney.Under the California tax measure, online retailers must collect a sales levy if they have a presence in the state, including a relationship with a local website that redirects shoppers in exchange for a fee.Overstock.com and some smaller online retailers have followed Amazon’s lead in cutting ties with online advertisers in California, in an attempt to avoid having a tax presence.Any individual or company can arrange a public referendum in California, but they must first show that there is sufficient support for the measure. Amazon will have to collect more than 500,000 signatures at least a month before any ballot.California’s constitution has been changed multiple times over the years by successful voter initiatives and public referendums, which have extended the state’s constitution to the extent that it is now the third longest in the world, with only India and the state of Alabama having longer constitutions.

to $77.93.These gains helped the S&P 500 index put on 1.3 per cent to 1,296.67 in a low volume session, adding to the 0.9 per cent rise on Monday.The 2.2 per cent bounce in the S&P so far this week comes after nearly two straight months of losses on the index, prompting some commentators to argue that US equities may have found their bottom.“The markets may retest the lows of last week, but I think we have reached a bottom and the worst of the declines are over,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The “risk-on” trade dominated in the session, leading the materials, energy and technology sectors sharply higher along with the consumer discretionaries.The technology sector was helped by a number of ratings upgrades, leaving the sector up 1.3 per cent.LinkedIn, the business focused social networking site, was up 11.2 per cent to $84.91 after a raft of banks put “buy” and “outperform” ratings on the stock as they began coverage following its initial public offering last month.Monster Worldwide added 9.9 per cent to $14.91, also lifted by a number of positive analysts reports.Elsewhere in the tech sector, Microsoft put on 2.4 per cent $25.80, adding to the 3.7 per cent gained in the previous session, as the company unveiled an online version of its Office software suite.The S&P energy sector was the best performing on Wall Street, rising 2.7 per cent as Schlumberger was up 4.6 per cent to $84.32 while Halliburton put on 5.3 per cent to $48.70.Among the materials stocks to gain were Freeport-McMoRan, which added 3.6 per cent to $50.45 and Cliff Natural Resources, which climbed 2.1 per cent to $89.21. The S&P materials index was up 1.8 per cent, benefiting from a rise in commodity prices.These gains helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 1.2 per cent to 12,188.69 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite add 1.5 per cent to 2,729.31.Overall sentiment was also helped by hopes that the Greek parliament would vote to approve some key austerity measures on Wednesday.Economic data from the session was mixed. The Case-Shiller index recorded a rare monthly rise in home prices in April on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, suggesting that the pace of decline in house prices may have abated somewhat.But the index was down 4 per cent from the previous year and it was not clear how much of the gain was due to recent higher temperatures. “It is much too early to tell if this is a turning point or simply due to some warmer weather,” said the report from Case-Shiller.Still, the S&P homebuilding index up 1.2 per cent in the session and Pulte group , the largest US housebuilder by sales, added 2.7 per cent to $7.89.In other economic news, data from the conference board found that US consumer confidence had fallen in June to its lowest since November 2010.The Vix volatility index, which is also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 5.4 per cent to 19.45 in the session, as traders turned more optimistic.In corporate news, Accenture gained 3.2 per cent to $59.66 after Standard & Poor’s said the consulting company would replace Marshall & Ilsley in the S&P 500 index next month when the regional bank’s takeover by Bank of Montreal is expected to close."

Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
157;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Accelerated buy-backs make a comeback;;"US companies are turning to a counter-intuitive strategy to return cash to shareholders: shorting their own stock.As companies with record cash on their balance sheets embark on a spree of share buy-backs, a handful are using a tactic not seen since before the financial crisis, known as “accelerated share repurchases”, or ASRs.In a traditional buy-back, the company uses a broker to buy shares on the open market. It can take weeks or months to complete an announced buy-back.But with an accelerated repurchase, the company asks their broker to short the full amount immediately. In a standard short, the broker borrows shares from other holders, sells them, then later buys shares to return them to the original holder.In an ASR, the borrowed shares are not sold; the company retires them. The broker then buys shares to cover the short, with the company agreeing to cover any losses on the trade.Such deals represent only a sliver of the buy-back market, which has totalled $263bn of announced buy-backs this year up to June 3, versus $174bn at the same point last year, according to Birinyi Associates, a research firm.Up to the same period, there have been 26 ASRs announced, including those from already authorised buy-backs, totaling about $8.5bn, according to Citigroup. That puts the market on pace to top last year’s total of 39 for $11bn, though still below the peak level of 117 deals for $79bn in 2007.Not all ASRs are announced before they are completed. The largest ASR so far this year was Express Scripts, a health care group, for $1.75bn. Retailer Home Depot and RR Donnelley, a printing group, have done $1bn ASRs.There are several benefits to ASRs and other “structured” buy-backs, in which companies use derivatives and other tools to engineer buy-backs to achieve pre-set price or volume targets.Accelerated repurchases can generate a bigger short-term boost to share prices, as investors might otherwise ignore a buy-back authorisation that could take years to execute.“Companies are trading off flexibility and collecting certainty about the economics,” said Robert Leonard, managing director of the special equity transactions group at Citigroup.Steve Roti, head of global equity-linked origination at Barclays Capital, added that the companies are willing to give up that flexibility because they do not see other uses for the cash, such as M&A or capital investment.“Otherwise, you might want a solution that allows you to start buying but to turn it off if an opportunity materialises,” he said.The accounting rules governing ASRs are in flux. The Securities and Exchange Commission last year asked for public comment on whether ASRs should be exempt from insider trading rules in the same way as traditional buy-backs.The Financial Services Accounting Review Board has been reviewing the accounting rules for ASRs since at least 2007.Some investors are wary of ASRs, as they immediately lower a company’s share count, and boost its apprent profitability on an earnings-per-share basis.For that reason, companies doing ASRs on average trade at a slight discount to their EPS, according to a study last year by professors at the University of Wisconsin and University of Florida.It also found the agreement to repay brokers was typically accounted for as an adjustment to the company’s balance sheet rather than a potential income liability marked to market. If the buy-back ends up being costly, the company would not take an income loss.“The accounting for ASRs should be re-examined,” the authors said.Michael Mauboussin, chief investment strategist at Legg Mason Capital Management, added: “The more bells and whistles are attached to a capital allocation decision, it becomes worrisome.”"
158;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Stewart shares surge on sale speculation;;Martha Stewart, the US television lifestyle guru, is considering a sale or a strategic partnership for the media business she founded as part of plans to expand her eponymous brand internationally.Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia jumped 27 per cent to $4.79 in lunchtime trading on Wednesday after the company said it had appointed Blackstone Advisory Partners to explore options for the business.People familiar with the matter said all possibilities would be considered, including a sale or a private equity buy-out, or teaming up with another company or entrepreneur to pursue growth overseas.Ultimately, Ms Stewart will decide the future of the business, which has a market value of about $270m. She owns about half of the business she created after publishing her first cookbook, Entertaining, in 1982, and she controls about 90 per cent of the votes.Ms Stewart has remained actively involved in the company in recent years, despite being convicted in 2004 of lying to federal investigators about a stock sale. She served five months in prison and later agreed to a five-year ban from serving as a director of a public company.She is due to return to the company’s board this August.While Ms Stewart has remained popular with viewers and readers, the company has had less success in creating new stars and brands. The company recruited Emeril Lagasse, the celebrity chef, to the group in 2008 to try to address the shortfall.In contrast, Oprah Winfrey, who on Wednesday aired her final broadcast of The Oprah Winfrey Show after 25 years, has cultivated a string of personalities including psychologist Dr Phil and Rachael Ray, the TV chef.Martha Stewart Living revenue last year was $230.8m, with a net loss of $9.6m. The business, which is built around TV programming, print media and merchandising, struggled during the economic downturn.People familiar with the company’s thinking said they saw most scope to boost the company’s performance in merchandising, where Ms Stewart’s name is used to sell products through partner stores.The company in 2009 lost a substantial merchandising deal with Kmart, which accounted for about a 10th of its revenues.However, it has since been rebuilding this business through agreements with retailers including Home Depot and Macy’s.Merchandising revenue rose 34 per cent in the first quarter of 2011, when Kmart revenue and another one-off payment were excluded from the results.Martha Stewart Living is also seeking to boost its senior management.On Wednesday, the company named Lisa Gersh, who co-founded the television network Oxygen, as president and chief operating officer.
159;HD;Home Depot;2011-05-19T21:38:20Z;US retail: shopaholic investors;For those who like growth, there are dynamic companies in the group;A dozen prominent American retailers displayed their financial wares last week, from big boxers (Walmart, Target) to hip clothiers (Abercrombie & Fitch, Urban Outfitters) to niche sellers (Petsmart, Williams-Sonoma). While the results were not quite celebratory, they were hardly funereal. On average top lines were up five per cent year-on-year, while same-store sales came in around 2 per cent. Operating margins for the 12 companies on average expanded a bit. The biggest stores (Home Depot, Walmart, Target) had a hard fight against market saturation and the law of large numbers, but most managed to produce some kind of growth. Guidance was middling. With a few exceptions (looking at you, Staples) there were no awful surprises.If the retail results this week were so pedestrian, however, why do investors seem to treat the sector like shoppers with unlimited credit? The share prices of the 12 companies trade at an average prospective price-to-earnings ratio of 17 times (excluding Sears, whose lack of earnings inflate the ratio). At that price, same-store sales growth lagging nominal output growth looks decidedly less attractive. For a similar or lower valuation investors can have Apple, which grew 80 per cent last quarter, or SABMiller, whose exposure to emerging markets any American retailer would give their eye teeth for.Still, for those who like growth, there are some dynamic companies in the group. Abercrombie’s naughty ads must be working to generate double-digit same store sales to go along with improved profitability. The firm’s p/e ratio, at 45 times, is less of a turn-on. Investors who insist on retail exposure would do well to shun glamour and look to humble Dollar Tree, which has sales approaching Abercrombie’s level, a sector-average valuation, and a strategy – really, really cheap products – that make sense even if the shopping habit remains subdued.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
160;HD;Home Depot;2011-05-17T21:14:09Z;Wall Street slips on poor US housing data;;Hewlett-Packard fell sharply after the technology group lowered its full-year earnings forecasts, while the wider markets fell for the third consecutive session after disappointing housing and industrial production data.Shares in the largest maker of personal computers by sales fell 7.3 per cent to $36.91, the worst performing stock on the S&P 500, after the group scaled back its revenue and profit forecasts for 2011.The company blamed the Japanese earthquake, slow sales of personal computers and reduced profit in its services business for the lower outlook.The stock was not helped by a degree of confusion surrounding the results. HP reported a day earlier than planned after a leaked memo from Léo Apotheker, its new chief executive, in which he warned that the company was facing “another tough quarter”.The disappointing results affected related technology stocks. NetApp, a provider of data storage, was down 1.5 per cent to $52.28 while SanDisk lost 3.4 per cent to $46.34.The S&P technology index was down 0.2 per cent.The S&P 500 closed down fractionally lower to 1,328.98 as sentiment was weighed down by data showing a sharp drop in US house construction.The number of houses built in April fell 10.6 per cent from the previous month, according to the US Department of Commerce, as oversupply sapped demand for new buildings.New building permits, a gauge of future construction, dropped 4 per cent in an indication that the sector will remain a drag on the economic recovery.This news weighed on homebuilding stocks. DR Horton, one of the largest US housebuilders, was down 1.7 per cent to $11.47 while Lennar lost 0.5 per cent to $17.50. The S&P homebuilding index declined 0.8 per cent.Data from the Federal Reserve showed an unexpected drop in manufacturing output last month. The 0.4 per cent fall was the first in 10 months and was led by an 8.9 per cent drop in autos.Industrial output remained static in the month, which was worse than the slight increase economists had been expecting. The news weakened stocks across the industrial sector. Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, was down 3.1 per cent to $102.81 while Joy Global fell 2.5 per cent to $86.19. The S&P industrial index was down 1.3 per cent, the worst performing sector on Wall Street.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.6 per cent to 12,479.58 and the Nasdaq Composite flat at 2,783.21.The broader markets have been in decline since the start of May as sentiment has been weighed down by sharp commodity price swings, European sovereign debt woes and worries about the end of quantitative easing.“The path of least resistance may be to the downside near term,” said analysts at Citigroup. “With traditional summer seasonality and some significant uncertainties … it does not appear likely that equity markets can bounce higher this summer.”The retail sector was in focus after mixed results from Walmart and Home Depot.Walmart was down 0.9 per cent to $55.54 after the world’s biggest retailer reported that sales in US stores that had been open more than a year had dropped for the eighth consecutive quarter. Net income rose 3.1 per cent to $3.6bn in the quarter, which served to limit the losses on the stock.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, was up 1.1 per cent to $37.40 after it raised its earnings outlook for the year and reported a strong gain in first-quarter income.Energy and material stocks lost ground as commodity prices softened.Materials was one of the worst performing sectors.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, fell 2.8 per cent to $16.45 and Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, lost 1.1 per cent to $46.83. The S&P materials index was 1.1 per cent lower.In the energy sector, Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, declined 0.2 per cent to $82.06. Cameron lost 2.3 per cent to $47.77. The S&P energy index was down 0.2 per cent.The financial sector was one of the few to gain in the session, led by Wells Fargo, which put on 3.2 per cent to $28.75.The S&P financial index added 0.7 per cent.
161;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Home Depot lifts outlook despite lower sales;;Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, raised its earnings outlook for the year and reported a strong gain in first-quarter income in spite of lagging sales.Profits at Home Depot rose 12 per cent in the first quarter to $812m, or 50 cents a share, from $725m, or 43 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. That was in line with analysts’ expectations and was helped by lower expenses over the quarter.But harsh weather in the first three months of this year and a depressed housing market weighed on sales, which slipped 0.2 per cent to $16.82bn from $16.86bn last year. Comparable sales at US stores were 0.7 per cent lower over the quarter, and the number of customer translations dropped 1.9 per cent.“Our sales declined slightly due to a slow spring selling season, but for the year we expect sales to grow in line with the guidance we previously provided,” said Frank Blake, chief executive. Home Depot expects sales to rise 2.5 per cent for the year and lifted its earnings forecast to $2.24 per share in 2011 from an earlier outlook of $2.20.The company’s announcement followed a disappointing report on Monday from rival Lowe’s, which said first-quarter income fell 6 per cent as sales slid 1.6 per cent on the poor weather and weak real estate sector.Home Depot shares were up 0.7 per cent at 37.25 in early trading in New York.
162;HD;Home Depot;2011-05-16T21:30:05Z;Economic data weigh on Wall Street;;Shares in NYSE Euronext fell sharply after Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange withdrew their bid, while in the wider markets the week kicked off in negative territory after a slew of disappointing economic data and some mixed earnings results.NYSE Euronext dropped 11.1 per cent to $36.36 after a joint bid from Nasdaq and ICE for the exchange was withdrawn. The $11bn offer had been higher than NYSE’s already agreed deal with Deutsche Börse.The two exchanges, which had been threatening to go hostile with their bid after it was rejected by the NYSE board, blamed the move on a failure to secure regulatory approval from US authorities.Shares in Nasdaq lost 2.5 per cent to $26.23 while ICE was up 3.3 per cent to $122.22.In the wider markets the S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent to 1,329.147 as weak data on housing and manufacturing left investors feeling uneasy.Figures from the New York Federal Reserve showed that manufacturing growth in the New York area had fallen to its lowest level in five months.The Empire State manufacturing index fell from 21.7 in April to 11.9 in May, the lowest level since December and well below economists’ expectations of 19.9.Separately, the National Association of Home Builders’ housing market index stayed at low levels, highlighting the weakness of the US housing market.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.4 per cent to 12,548.30 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 2,782.31.This follows a loss of 1.9 per cent on the S&P 500 over the past two weeks as commodity prices tumbled lower and investors worried about the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Greece.The retail sector lost ground in the session as a week of earnings reports from big industry groups kicked off in a mixed fashion after JC Penney surpassed expectations but Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, released disappointing results.JC Penney, the mid-range US department store, reported first-quarter earnings up 7 per cent, benefiting from cost reductions and from strong sales in its exclusive brand names.But sentiment in the sector was weighed on by Lowe’s lacklustre results.First-quarter net income for the home improvement store fell 6 per cent, as the weak housing market limited demand for remodelling projects.The company blamed the 1.6 per cent fall in sales on poor weather and the housing market. Lowe’s reported earnings of 34 cents a share on net income of $461m, short of the 36 cents a share expected by analysts.Shares in Lowe’s fell 3.6 per cent to $24.83 while JC Penney fell 3.2 per cent to $37.21, dragged down with the rest of the sector.The S&P retail sector was down 1 per cent, one of the worst performing on Wall Street. Last Monday, Macy’s reported strong results and later this week Home Depot, Walmart and Target will report their first-quarter earnings.The general ‘risk off’ trade hit technology stocks the hardest, with the S&P technology index falling 1.5 per cent.These losses were led by Monster Worldwide, the jobs listings service provider, was down 8.3 per cent to $14.99 while Yahoo fell 4.5 per cent to $15.81. Salesforce.com, which provides an online service for salespeople to manage their customer data, lost 4.4 per cent to $128.96.In deal news, Joy Global, which manufactures mining equipment, bought equipment maker LeTourneau Technologies from Rowan for $1.1bn. The news sent Joy Global up 1 per cent to $88.36, but Rowan lost 0.2 per cent to $37.96.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Siga Technologies added 2.3 per cent to $14.52 after the pharmaceutical company said it had won a $433m contract with the US Department of Health and Human Services to deliver 2m courses of its smallpox antiviral.The contract includes options that would raise the total value to approximately $2.8bn.Merck, another drugmaker, was up 0.6 per cent to $37.30 after it won approval to launch a new hepatitis C drug after the Food and Drug Administration evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the treatment in clinical trials.Iron Mountain, the US information storage company, was up 0.7 per cent to $32.67 after Autonomy, the UK software group, said it had agreed to buy selected assets of the company’s digital arm for $380m in cash.
163;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Street smarts needed to thrive in China;;Shanghai’s premier shopping street, Huai Hai Middle Road, is a roadmap of US brands.At number 550 stands the shuttered House of Barbie, the department store for the doll and symbol of all that can go wrong when the US sells to China.At number 887 are KFC and Pizza Hut, examples of what can go right in the relationship between multinationals and China consumers.Occupying pride of place at number 1 is Starbucks, the coffee-house.The street tells a tale of foreign capitalism in China, with a moral: to thrive on the mainland, brands must be flexible, meaning altering not just their products but sometimes their core business models to suit Chinese tastes and culture.After setbacks for brands such as Home Depot, Best Buy and Barbie, which have closed stores or withdrawn after failing to win over Chinese consumers, the lessons of Huai Hai Road are germane.“Anybody who comes into this market and thinks they can just plant their brand and let it grow will be sadly mistaken,” Tom Doctoroff, north Asia chief executive of JWT, the advertising agency, says.“Any [foreign] business model needs to be brought into alignment with Chinese cultural and consumer imperatives.”He points to Pizza Hut, Starbucks and Häagen-Dazs as the gold standard for foreign brand success in China. They took products alien to Chinese tastes and made them popular.Pizza Hut and KFC, both owned by Yum Brands, localised their menu. On Huai Hai Road, Pizza Hut offers teriyaki squid with quail egg skewers, while one of KFC’s most popular breakfast dishes is rice gruel with thousand-year egg.But adjusting to local tastes is not just about food, Mr Doctoroff says.Pizza Hut, Starbucks and Häagen-Dazs all focused on eat-in, rather than carry-out, in China.“Barbie just got plonked down in China.”Even luxury goods companies have had to adapt their model, he says. The Chinese market for luxury goods is “broad and shallow”. Not all consumers can afford a luxury handbag, so top-end brands offer more accessories such as key-chains and sunglasses.“When foreign companies come to China, they are very proud of the business model that gave them success in other countries,” Chen Can, of Beijing-based Analysys International, says.Amway, the US direct selling company that has 43 per cent of the China direct sales market, took the opposite approach, abandoning core elements of its business model when pressed to do so by Beijing. This included setting up retail outlets, which it had in no other country.Eva Cheng, recently retired head of Amway China, says the company changed its strategy “to promote harmony and fusion with the Chinese culture” – words that might not trip off the tongue of every foreign chief executive.This has proved to be a winning strategy, Audie Wong, president of Amway China, says.“At first we opened retail stores to comply with government regulations, but then we found they were very useful,” he says.He notes that Chinese consumers prefer a brand with premises they can visit in case of problems.China is Amway’s biggest market, with sales of Rmb22bn ($3.6bn) last year.John Quelch, dean of the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, says the go-to-market strategy of companies must be locally tailored.“The key differentiator between successful and unsuccessful companies is distribution management,” he says.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen
164;HD;Home Depot;2011-03-31T21:02:33Z;Wall Street down after jobless data revision;;Berkshire Hathaway shares slid after the unexpected resignation of one of its key figures while the wider markets closed out the best first quarter in over a decade, despite edging slightly lower in the session on weak economic data.Berkshire Hathaway lost ground after David Sokol, one of the leading contenders to succeed Warren Buffett as chief executive, resigned just weeks after the investment company agreed to purchase Lubrizol for $9bn – a business in which he held stock.Class B shares in Berkshire Hathaway were down 2.1 per cent to $83.68, one of the worst performing in the financial sector. Elsewhere, Bank of America was down 0.9 per cent to $13.33 while SunTrust Banks fell 1.2 per cent to $28.86.The S&P financial index was down 0.4 per cent, the worst performing of all the S&P sub-indices.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent to 1,325.83, following a string of lacklustre economic numbers.Figures from the Labor Department announced that 12,000 more people had claimed benefits than had initially been reported last week, weighing on sentiment. The four-week moving average of claims went up 3,000 to 394,000.However, the news was not all bad as it also reported that initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped by 6,000 last week. This helped to limit losses in the session ahead of the all important official non-farm payroll number due to be released today.“The revised data show a slightly less steep drop in claims over the past few months, but the key point here is that the trend is still clearly downwards,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.Other figures showed that US factory orders had fallen 0.1 per cent in February, which was more than expected, and that business activity had expanded at a slower rate in March than in the previous month.Overall, that disappointing data left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.2 per cent at 12,320.79 while the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.2 per cent to 2,781.07.The Dow was up 6.7 per cent in the quarter, which was the best first quarter for the index since 1998.The retail sector lost ground in the session led by CarMax, which fell 7.2 per cent to $32.10 after the biggest US used-car dealer reported lower gross margins for the fourth quarter. However, the group also reported earnings up 19 per cent and double-digit gains in sales of vehicles.Elsewhere in the sector home improvement retailers lost ground, with Home Depot falling 1.4 per cent to $37.06 while Lowe’s lost 2 per cent to $26.43. Earlier in the week, Home Depot had seen gains after announcing plans to issue $2bn of debt and buy back $1bn of stock.The S&P retail sector was down 0.7 per cent, one of the worst performing in the session along with financials. Looking at the first quarter on Wall Street, equities have seen strong 5.6 per cent gains. It was the best first quarter for the S&P 500 since 1998. On average since 1998, the S&P 500 index has lost 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of the year, with the index losing ground in six out of the previous 13 first quarters.The markets began the year in a euphoric state, continuing the rally from early September 2010 when Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, hinted that the Fed would support financial markets with a renewed bond-buying program.The S&P 500 saw a sharp 6.8 per cent rise throughout January and the first half of February, reaching the point where many commentators started to argue equities were overbought and due a correction.Then in the middle of February, the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East and the subsequent spike in oil prices provided a catalyst for a sell off.That was compounded in March by a further retreat following the natural disaster in Japan. These worries saw markets marked down 6.4 per cent in four weeks. Since the middle of March, the index has rallied back 5.6 per cent as traders have turned their attentions towards the domestic economic recovery.“Ultimately, the markets have been predisposed to positive news and have had a tendency to shrug off negative news,” said Matthew Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management.Energy stocks dominated the quarter, with the S&P energy index up 16.8 per cent as oil prices soared. Chevron rose 17.8 per cent in the quarter to $107.49.Industrial stocks have been the next biggest winner rising 8.1 per cent. Caterpillar has put on 18.9 per cent to $111.40 over the quarter.
165;HD;Home Depot;2011-03-29T21:24:28Z;US stocks shrug off poor economic data;;Homebuilders lost ground following weak US housing data but the wider markets were resilient as traders were reluctant to take money off the table ahead of non-farm payroll numbers on Friday.DR Horton, the second-largest US housebuilder, was down 1.7 per cent to $11.95 after data showed that US house prices were continuing to spiral downwards.The Case-Shiller composite index showed prices had fallen 3.3 per cent in January on a year-to-year basis, which was worse than expected and followed on from a 2.4 per cent decline in December.Shares in Lennar, another homebuilder, were down 3.5 per cent to $19.05, also weighed on by news that the company’s new home orders had fallen 12 per cent in the first quarter. The S&P homebuilding index was down 1.8 per cent.But the wider markets ticked higher as traders remained optimistic about crucial economic numbers to be released later this week.“Traders are wondering if they really want to be out of this market when the non-farm payroll number comes out on Friday,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.The S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent to 1,319.44, also shrugging off separate data from the Conference Board showing that consumer confidence had fallen in March. The index was down from 72.4 in February to 63.4.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7 per cent to 12,278.79, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,756.89.Retail stocks saw some of the biggest gains in the session led by Home Depot after the home improvement retailer announced plans to issue $2bn of debt and buy back $1bn of stock. Shares in the company were up 2.9 per cent to $37.70.Elsewhere in the sector, Amazon.com was up 3.1 per cent to $174.62 after unveiling a “cloud” service that would allows users to store their digital music online and play it on any computer or Android device.Google, which developed and operates the Android platform, was up 1.1 per cent to $581.73.Phillips-Van Heusen, the fashion group that owns Calvin Klein, saw gains after reporting that its fourth-quarter profits had nearly doubled to $52.2m and that adjusted earnings had also beaten market expectations. The stock was up 8.4 per cent to $65.22. The S&P retail sector was up 1.1 per cent.Other winners in the session were oilfield service stocks, which continued to gain on hopes that increased production in Saudi Arabia would lead to more business.Schlumberger was up 4.4 per cent to $94.37, adding to the 4.1 per cent gains in the previous session, while Halliburton put on 2.3 per cent to $49 following 4 per cent gains on Monday.Advances in Halliburton were limited by a warning from the group that its earnings would be “severely” affected by the disruptions in north Africa and the Middle East and would shave an estimated 3-4 cents per share from profits. The oilfield services company also said that a further 5-8 cents per share in earnings would be lost because of weather related issues.Elsewhere in the energy sector, General Electric agreed to buy Converteam, a privately owned maker of electrification equipment, for about $3.2bn. Shares in GE were up 0.6 per cent to $19.86.The industrial group has now spent $11bn in the last six months on a string of energy companies including Dresser, Wellstream Holdings and the well support unit of John Wood Group.For-profit education companies were dragged down after Apollo Group, the company that owns the University of Phoenix, reported a second-quarter loss and announced that new enrolment had fallen by 45 per cent.Shares in Apollo were down 4.3 per cent to $40.55 as the company also forecast that fiscal 2012 revenue would be no more than $4.25bn, missing the average analyst estimate of $4.55bn.Elsewhere in the sector Corinthian Colleges fell 3.5 per cent to $4.40 while Strayer Education lost 5 per cent to $127.06. DeVry declined 1 per cent to $54.41.Hertz Global lost ground after announcing that its three largest shareholders were selling 50m shares in the car rental group. Hertz also forecast that its first-quarter revenue would rise, but that it would be hurt by the storms in January and February. The stock was down 5.4 per cent to $15.40.
166;HD;Home Depot;2011-03-07T22:57:39Z;Why do so many get it so wrong in China?;Best Buy makes the latest western blunder;My first reaction to Best Buy’s closure of its nine branded stores in China was: not again. Another retailer had leapt into the Chinese market – and fallen on its face.Best Buy’s stores – familiar to North Americans and Europeans – are arranged by category of gadget and are big on service. But most Chinese are used to buying electrical goods more cheaply from makers’ agents, working in stores owned by established Chinese competitors such as Suning and Gome, or from smaller, local shops.Home Depot, the US DIY group, recently closed stores in mainland China, having misread the local market. On Monday, Mattel shuttered its six-storey flagship Barbie store in Shanghai, in the face of waning enthusiasm for a doll ubiquitous in its established markets.All plainly failed to meet Peter Drucker’s requirement for “true marketing”, which starts “with the customer, his demographics, his realities, his needs, his values. It does not ask, What do we want to sell? It asks, What does the customer want to buy? It does not say, This is what our product or service does. It says, These are the satisfactions the customer looks for, values and needs”.Yet when Best Buy announced its Chinese move in 2005, it seemed to have struck the right note. Its “lab stores” would be managed by “local leaders” with “strong customer insights”. This would help “accelerate learning about the diverse consumers in China”. Vapid prose apart, Drucker himself could have drafted that press release.It didn’t need much local insight to deduce that most Chinese customers wouldn’t buy warranties, need installation or pay more for goods available elsewhere for less. But success in its home market made Best Buy overconfident. Kal Patel, now the group’s Asia president and the man who recommended closure, says: “When you’re very, very successful, you can sometimes do things that feel like they go against rational logic. Very good people look at the numbers and then they say: ‘We could change the industry.’”In fact, Best Buy was learning an increasing amount about the Chinese domestic market from its parallel ownership of Five Star, a chain of electrical retailers operating on the traditional model, where it acquired control in 2006. It was the US model that fell short. Mr Patel says: “Long term, I question whether you can be that revolutionary with the industrial structure [in China]: five years we’ve been there and the industrial model hasn’t changed.”In spite of Best Buy’s setback, rivals are still convinced they know better. Within days of the retailer’s news, Media Markt heralded further expansion in China, on a model that sounds oddly similar to the one that let its US competitor down.What lessons should those who follow in Best Buy’s footsteps learn?●Use local knowledge and relevant prior experience. Non-Chinese brewers failed to push the local consumer up to premium beers, while SABMiller, drawing on its knowledge of another emerging market – South Africa – read the local conditions better.●Start small. Mr Patel says that if Best Buy were launching a Chinese strategy now, it would try out “fast, quick, cheap” ideas. The total bill for restructuring in China, the closure of two more branded stores in Turkey and a revamp of the US supply chain came to $225m-$245m. Even if only part of that bill was attributable to the China experiment, that is a costly laboratory.●Work on several fronts. Best Buy – which now owns all of Five Star – will expand its locally branded stores in China. But it will also incubate ideas via the internet, work with local partners and explore other options, such as stores within stores.●Be different. The success of Apple stores in China, which provide the only reliable outlet for its products, contrasts with Best Buy’s experience.●Stay humble. Non-Chinese groups still seem prone to arrogance about the applicability of their business models that would have embarrassed 16th-century Portuguese traders.By contrast, Chinese groups investing abroad are using a different tone. Wang Zongnan, chairman of Bright Food, told the Financial Times he would keep Yoplait’s existing management if his bid for the French yoghurt maker succeeded, “because Bright has insufficient knowledge of international markets”. This could be rhetoric, or politics, or a mixture of both. But foreign investors that fail to recognise what they do not know will be condemned to an endless and costly round of trial and error. And error. And error.andrew.hill@ft.comAndrew Hill blogs at www.ft.com/businessblog
167;HD;Home Depot;2011-03-07T13:52:51Z;Barbie shuts up shop in Shanghai;;Barbie, the slender symbol of American consumerism, has shut up shop in Shanghai just two years after opening her biggest flagship store in China’s most populous city.Mattel, owner of the iconic doll brand, said the bright pink, six-storey store had served its purpose of building brand awareness in the new market.But analysts say the investment was a failure because it did not adjust to the local market.The withdrawal comes on the heels of store closures in China by US retailers Home Depot and Best Buy, which have both struggled to crack the local market.The failure of the US brands to prosper come despite efforts by the Chinese government to make boosting domestic consumption a top policy priority. Retail sales grew at more than 18 per cent in 2010 from a year earlier.“None of the three companies – Best Buy, Home Depot or Barbie – have catered to local consumer preferences and habits enough,” said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group.“In Barbie’s case, they chose the wrong location [for the flagship store] and they offered sexy clothes designed by Patricia Field of Sex and the City fame when young Chinese women tend to prefer cute designs like Hello Kitty.”As well as having the world’s biggest collection of Barbie dolls and expensive Barbie-themed clothing, the flagship store on the chic Huaihai Road boasted a beauty salon and restaurant where young Chinese could get made up like Barbie and eat her favourite food.When the store opened with great fanfare in March 2009, Mattel said it would be the “ultimate destination for both young girls who call Barbie a best friend and women who appreciate Barbie as a fashion and lifestyle icon.”However, a Mattel spokesperson said on Monday that the closure was “mainly due to a strategy change” in China and that the company “continues to be committed” to developing the Barbie brand in the country.Analysts said Barbie, Best Buy and Home Depot were all seen by consumers as expensive in a price-sensitive market where Chinese competitors operate on razor-thin margins.Many western brands, such as Nike, LVMH, Carrefour and Wal-Mart, have successfully localised in China and become hugely profitable there.Best Buy’s business model in the US, where it markets itself as providing better service than competitors, did not go down well with Chinese consumers and in February it said it would close all nine Best Buy-branded stores in China.Home Depot acquired 10 stores in China in 2006, but has closed five of them in the past two years after struggling to compete in the cut-throat home improvement market.However, the spate of failures do not appear to have dissuaded another icon of US consumer culture from investing in Shanghai.The city’s mayor was quoted in state media on Monday saying the Chinese government had approved Rmb24.5bn ($3.7bn) for investment in a Disney theme park to be built by Walt Disney Co in the city by 2015.
168;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Lowe’s offers weak sales outlook;;"Lowe’s, the US home improvement retailer, warned on Wednesday that its customers are increasingly fearful of inflation this year, as commodity prices and wages in China rise.The company said that it has already received requests for price increases from vendors and that, although it would work to minimise those increases, it expects to pass along the majority of the additional costs to customers.“These pressures were caused by growing wage inflation in overseas markets and increasing costs for fuel and raw materials such as steel,” Larry Stone, Lowe’s president and chief operating officer, said in a call with analysts.Mr Stone, who is retiring in June, said the company is closely watching rising prices for petrol, clothing and food and is concerned about the impact that inflation will have on consumer confidence and spending.Lowe’s was cautious in its outlook for this year, projecting that comparable store sales in the first quarter would be flat.The weak forecast sent the company’s shares down by 2.39 per cent to $25.35 in midday trading in New York, in spite of solid fourth-quarter earnings.Net income at Lowe’s rose by 39 per cent to $285m, or 21 cents a share, up from $205m, or 14 cents in the same period a year ago.Sales at Lowe’s were up by 3.1 per cent to $10.5bn during the final three months of last year, with comparable store sales up by 1.1 per cent.The company said that severe winter weather was an overall drag, but that purchases of shovels, snowblowers and ice melt were up.Lowe’s has been focusing on its appliance business and in late September launched a repair programme.Last month, Lowe’s said it would cut 1,700 middle-
manager positions but hire 50,000 temporary seasonal workers at its 1,725 stores. Lowe’s performance failed to match that of its bigger rival Home Depot, which on Tuesday reported a 72 per cent surge in fourth-quarter profits, its strongest
quarterly sales since the start of the US economic slowdown.“Lowe’s is ceding a touch of market share to the renewed Home Depot, which is putting more employees on customer-
facing initiatives and being quite nimble on inventory planning and marketing,” said Brian Sozzi, retail analyst at Wall Street Strategies.Mr Sozzi suggested that the weaker outlook from Lowe’s was likely the result of weather-related concerns and the initial impact of price increases from vendors."
169;HD;Home Depot;2011-02-23T19:24:03Z;HP results drag US technology sector;;Wall Street saw another day of sharp losses as disappointing results from Hewlett-Packard weighed on the technology sector and investors looked uneasily towards the continuing unrest in the Middle East and north Africa.The technology group surprised traders by reporting weaker-than-expected quarterly revenues, dragged down by lower personal computer sales. The company also lowered its revenue guidance for the current year by $2bn. The stock slumped 10.1 per cent to $43.36.The earnings news weighed on the sector. EMC, the world’s largest data-storage company by revenue, was down 1.2 per cent to $26.27 and the S&P technology index lost 1.6 per cent.That helped drag the S&P 500 down 0.9 per cent to 1,303.46 by mid-session on Wall Street.In the previous session the index lost 2.1 per cent on the geopolitical tensions and escalating violence in Libya, the sharpest one-day fall on the index in six months. The second consecutive day of losses has prompted commentators to ask whether this is the beginning of the widely prophesised pull-back in the US markets.“This situation has some similarities with the eurozone crisis nearly a year ago which led to a temporary correction in the markets,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. “But upwards momentum in the economy looks a lot stronger now than a year ago,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.8 per cent lower at 12,118.45 and the Nasdaq was down 1.7 per cent to 2,710.82. The S&P 500 is still up 2.6 per cent this year. Energy stocks saw some of the few gains in the session as oil prices surpassed $110 a barrel for the first time since before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Industry executives’ estimated that at least half of Libya’s oil production has been shut down due to the violence.Marathon Oil, a leading US oil and gas company, was up 4.2 per cent to $49.69 while Chevron added 3.3 per cent to $103.58. The S&P energy index rose 2.2 per cent to a 2½-year high.Elsewhere in the sector Cabot Oil & Gas was up 12 per cent to $44.59 after the natural gas producer reported strong fourth-quarter results. Range Resources, the oil and gas exploration and production company, rose 8.6 per cent to $52.82.Sentiment in the energy sector was also aided by more deal activity. Enterprise Products Partners, an oil and gas energy partnership, made an offer to acquire Duncan Energy Partners for about $2.41bn.Duncan Energy was up 24.1 per cent to $40.40 on the news while Enterprise Products was down 0.6 per cent to $43.42.This week, Holly and Frontier Oil announced a merger that will create a $7bn oil refining company while BHP Billiton agreed to buy Chesapeake Energy’s shale gas business for $4.7bn.The global energy and power sector has seen the strongest start to the year in terms of mergers and acquisitions activity on record, according Thompson Reuters data.The value of energy and power mergers and acquisitions now totals $93.7bn, a 40 per cent increase over this time last year. Half of this activity has been in the US.Looking at economic data, investors were given some small cause for celebration as data showed that the number of existing home sales rose unexpectedly in January. Home sales were up 2.7 per cent from the previous month, according to the National Association of Realtors, slightly ahead of estimates.But data in the previous session showed that house prices had continued to fall in December, limiting investor optimism about the troubled US housing market.Lowe’s saw losses after the home improvement retailer projected flat comparable store sales and slightly decreasing margins.The company also reported that fourth-quarter profits had jumped thanks to greater demand for house renovation projects, which helped to limit the losses on the stock. The shares were still down 2 per cent to $25.46, however.The results come the day after larger rival Home Depot reported strong quarterly results and raised its profit forecast for the year.Netflix continued to lose ground after news earlier this week that Amazon.com was launching a rival video streaming service. Shares were down 4.8 per cent to $211.02. Amazon slid 3.2 per cent to $174.73.
170;HD;Home Depot;2011-02-23T00:03:22Z;Commodity stocks lead losses on Wall Street;;"Disappointing results from Walmart and concerns over turmoil in Libya caused Wall Street to suffer its sharpest one-day fall in six months.Shares in the largest retailer in the world by sales lost ground after fourth-quarter revenue fell short of forecasts; the company had predicted a turnround in sales declines.Losses were limited, however, as profit came in at the top of estimates at $6.06bn, or $1.70 a share.But shares in Walmart still fell 3.1 per cent to $53.67, helping to weigh on the retail sector.The sector, which was down 2 per cent, was also caught up in the wider retreat away from equities as turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa spooked investors.These worries caused the S&P 500 close down 2.1 per cent, the largest one day fall since August. The index had been at 30-month highs at the end of last week.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, rocketed up 29.8 per cent in the sharpest one day jump since May.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.4 per cent lower at 12,212.72 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.7 per cent to 2,756.42. Materials stocks saw some of the sharpest declines as the violence in Libya sucked away global risk appetite and softened commodity prices.Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest copper producer, fell 4.9 per cent to $50.38 and Cliff Natural Resources was down 4 per cent to $92.73. The S&P materials index declined 3.3 per cent.Financial stocks also saw heavy losses. Bank of America was down 3.6 per cent to $14.18 while the S&P financial index was down 3 per cent.“We have a market that is overextended and traders are looking for a catalyst to take profits,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “But it looks like the Middle East and north Africa problems will not be enough to bring about a sustained correction unless the strong US domestic economic data begin to fade,” he added.Integrated oil and gas companies saw some of the few gains in the session as the outbreak of violence in Libya caused oil prices to shoot up for the second consecutive day.Chevron rose .6 per cent to $100.32 while ExxonMobil added 1.1 per cent to $85.44. The S&P integrated oil and gas index was up 0.7 per cent.In economic data, the consumer confidence index from the Conference Board increased to 70.4 in February, a three-year high.“Looking ahead, consumers are more positive about the economy and their income prospects but feel somewhat mixed about employment conditions,” said a statement from the Conference Board.The S&P Case-Shiller home price index fell 4 per cent in the last quarter of 2010.The recent flurry of mergers and acquisitions activity continued on Wall Street with two oil refiners, Holly and Frontier Oil, announcing a merger that will create a $7bn company. Holly was down 1 per cent to $55.57 while Frontier was 4.9 per cent lower to $26.97.In other deal news, Carl Icahn, the activist investor, offered to buy Mentor Graphics, the electronic design specialist, for $1.91bn or $17 a share. Shares in Mentor were up 6.5 per cent to $15.47 on the news.Chesapeake Energy added 5.1 per cent to $31.99 after BHP Billiton, the global mining and energy group, agreed to buy its shale gas business for $4.7bn. BHP said it was buying Chesapeake’s 75 per cent stake in Fayetteville shale natural gas field in Arkansas, which was put up for sale by the US gas producer two weeks ago.The sale, announced on Monday, is part of a continuing effort by Chesapeake to reduce its long-term debt by 25 per cent in 2011 to 2012 by selling assets and cutting spending.Home Depot reported that profits had risen by 71 per cent in the fourth quarter.The largest US home improvement retailer by sales posted earnings of $587m or 36 cents a share – up from $342m or 20 cents a share a year earlier.That was ahead of analysts’ estimates of 31 cents a share but the stock was still down 1 per cent to $38.08 in the session. This was ahead of the broader retail sector, however, which declined 2 per cent.Macy’s said its fourth-quarter profit had risen by 50 per cent from the previous year.The department store chain reported a profit of $667m, or $1.55 a share, up from $445m, or $1.05 a share, last year. However, the shares slipped back 1.2 per cent to $23.46."
171;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Best Buy brand closes shop in China and Turkey;;Best Buy, the world’s largest electronics retailer by sales, is closing all of its branded stores in China, highlighting the resistance of Chinese shoppers to some western-style store experiences.The retailer, which will continue to run 170 stores in China under the Five Star brand acquired five years ago, is also giving up an attempt to enter Turkey, with the closure of two trial-run stores opened in the past two years.The company said in a statement it would close all nine China stores that carry the Best Buy brand, one of the best-known US retail marques, but one that has failed to catch on in China. It captured less than 1 per cent of the China market, analysts said, struggling to compete against the more agile and aggressive homegrown rivals Gome and Suning, which each have more than 1,000 branded stores in China.Best Buy’s business model in the US, where the brand markets itself as providing a better service than its competitors, has not gone down well in China. “Best Buy believed it could grab market share in China by offering high-quality service and a good shopping experience,” says Torsten Stocker, retail analyst at Monitor Group. “But what determines Chinese consumers’ purchasing decisions is price, not service.”Best Buy’s store strategy was also at odds with local habits. Chinese retailers generally divide up electronics and other large-ticket items by leading brands, rather than category, supported by sales staff working for the manufacturers rather than for the retailer.Home Depot and Kingfisher, the US and UK home improvement retailers, have also struggled with western-style sales models in China. In contrast, Chinese shoppers have enthusiastically embraced modern supermarkets and discount stores operated by leading international retailers including Walmart, Metro and Tesco.Dora Sahintürk, from Istanbul retail specialist AVM Mfi Partners, said Best Buy had suffered in Turkey by trying to compete on quality in a price-sensitive market.Other electronics chains such as Darty or Metro group’s Media Markt, entered Turkey earlier and have expanded rapidly, drawn by rising prosperity and a young population to compete with the leading domestic chain, the Sabanci group’s Teknosa.Best Buy said it would continue to invest in China, despite closing down its own-branded stores.In 2006, it took control of Five Star, a local electronics retailer based in China’s eastern Jiangsu province. It now plans to expand the chain. The company said in a statement that those stores were “profitable and have significant growth opportunities”. Five Star has about 170 stores, according to its website, and Best Buy said it planned to open 40 to 50 more stores in fiscal 2012.The group said it expected the restructuring to result in annual pre-tax savings of $60m-$70m when fully realised in 2013, mostly from cutting operating losses and IT infrastructure costs in Turkey and China.
172;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Home Depot quarterly profits up 71%;;Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, on Tuesday reported its strongest quarterly sales growth since the beginning of the US economic slowdown and raised its earnings forecast for the coming year.The retailer also reported its first annual sales gain since the start of the US housing crisis in 2006, with sales up 2.8 per cent at $68bn.During the fourth quarter, the retailer said comparable sales at its almost 2,000 US superstores increased by 4.8 per cent against the fourth quarter last year, while its total sales including its international business rose 3.8 per cent to $15.1bn.Home Depot’s net earnings rose 71.6 per cent to $587m, or 36 cents per diluted share, against Wall Street’s consensus forecast of 31 cents.For the current fiscal year, it forecast a net sales increase of 2.5 per cent, and the retailer raised its forecast for earnings per share to $2.20 from $2.01 previously.The retailer reported a 1.4 per cent increase in the number of customer transactions, while its average transaction value rose 2.6 per cent to $51.31.
173;HD;Home Depot;2011-01-27T19:49:38Z;Home Depot leaves Beijing;;Home Depot, the largest US home improvement retailer by sales, has closed its last store in Beijing, highlighting the difficulties that some western companies face when trying to transplant foreign business models into China.Home Depot, which has closed five stores on the mainland in the past two years, is struggling to find the right business format for one of the world’s most difficult home improvement markets, local analysts said.“Nobody wants DIY [in China],” said Matthew Crabbe of Access Asia, a Shanghai-based retail consultancy.The do-it-yourself culture that sustains Home Depot in the US, where the retailer has about 1,700 stores, is absent in China, where low wages, an abundance of migrant worker labourers and other cultural, social and economic factors suppress demand for the kind of home improvement retailing common in the US or Europe, according to analysts.“In China, even the more price-sensitive people hire labourers,” said James Roy of China Market Research in Shanghai.DIY retailers face tough competition from China’s vast “home decoration malls”, which combine many different brands offering sales and service under one roof, in an area often in the hundreds of thousands of square metres, several times the size of a Home Depot store, said Mr Roy.Home Depot said in a statement that it “remains committed to China” and retains seven stores elsewhere in the country. The company’s Beijing West Fourth Ring Road store, which was shut last week, was closed after “commercial and financial evaluations,” the company said. Sources close to the company said it was rethinking its business model in China.Home Depot acquired 10 stores in China in 2006, under Bob Nardelli, its former chief executive. Its current leadership has focused more on improving the performance of its US stores than on further international expansion.B&Q, Europe’s largest home improvement chain, has had similar problems in China. A B&Q China spokesman was not available for comment, but as many as a third of B&Q’s mainland stores have recently closed.Foreign home improvement retailers had hoped that China could help drive sales at a time of negative or slow growth in the US and Europe. China adds many millions of new homeowners each year, and the homes they buy are typically just empty shells – creating an apparent ready market for home improvement retailers.But DIY retailers are at a disadvantage, said Torsten Stocker, retail analyst at Monitor Group in Shanghai. “People don’t grow up with DIY, so they don’t have the skills, and they also don’t have the storage space [for tools],” he said, noting “in Europe or the US you have a garage or a basement where you can keep that ladder or drill” but many Chinese have very small flats with no storage space. “Maybe it is a business model whose time has not come yet in China,” he said.
174;HD;Home Depot;2011-01-20T23:32:00Z;US stocks led lower by energy sector;;Morgan Stanley posted an 88 per cent jump in fourth-quarter profits but this failed to lift the banking sector which is still in the doldrums following weak results from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup earlier in the week.Shares in the investment bank were up 1.7 per cent to $28.22 after reporting net income from continuing operations of $867m, or 43 cents a share, up from $460m or 18 cents, in the same period a year earlier. This was slightly ahead of analysts’ estimates of 40 cents per share.But the BKX banking index was down 0.8 per cent to 52.36 as investors continued to readjust their expectations about the earnings season following a string of lacklustre results from the industry.Hudson City Bancorp was down 4.3 per cent to $11.51 while SunTrust Banks fell 2.5 per cent to $27.68.By mid-session, the S&P 500 was down 0.7 per cent to 1,273.24, weighed on primarily by the energy and materials sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5 per cent to 11,768.24 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent to 2,690.31.The S&P energy index was down 1.8 per cent to 515.13 on fears that China would take steps to cool down its economy after GDP figures showed the country was growing faster than expected.Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, was down 3.3 per cent to $83.46 while Halliburtonfell 2.1 per cent to $38.40. ExxonMobilfell 1.4 per cent to $77.13.The materials sector also lost ground on concerns over China. Alcoa, the largest aluminium producer in the US, fell 2.2 per cent to $15.71 while the S&P materials index was down 2.1 per cent to 232.34. Investors to some extent have been looking for excuses to take profit, as a variety of technical indicators have been pointing to the markets being overbought following the 22 per cent gains on the S&P since September.Before the 1.3 per cent losses on the S&P so far this week, the S&P’s relative strength index, which tracks the speed and strength of price movements, was more than 75 – one of the technical signs that a market is overextended.Similarly the Vix volatility index and the put/call ratio on the S&P were also indicating an overconfident market.Helping to limit the losses in the wider US markets was a raft of promising economic numbers from the US.Strong unemployment data showed that claims had fallen to 404,000 in the week ending January 15 to a two-year low, down 37,000 from the previous week. These results came in lower than the 420,000 forecast.“The trend in claims is clearly downwards, driven – we believe – by the easing credit situation for small firms,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at HFE. “More credit means fewer lay-offs, and fewer lay-offs mean stronger payroll growth. It won’t be long before the jobs numbers look better,” he said.Also improving sentiment was news that existing home sales in the US had risen by more than expected in December, according to the National Association of Realtors. Home Depot, the largest US home improvement retailer, was buoyed by the data, rising 1.7 per cent to $36.23.At the same time the Conference Board, a research group, said that its index of positive indicators for future economic activity had also surpassed expectations.The only weak economic data was the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s manufacturing index, which declined unexpectedly in January. But there was cause for hope as the data showed an increase in new orders and employment in the manufacturing sector.In the technology sector, strong results from Ebayafter the market closed on Wednesday were not enough to lift the wider sector. Shares in the online retailer were up 3.7 per cent to $30.18.The S&P technology index was down 2.2 per cent to 445.91, led by F5 Networks which saw dramatic losses despite reporting a 90 per cent increase in first-quarter earnings.

It was reported that the sale, which would take place in the first half of 2011, could total more than $10bn.The company also struck a deal to repay its Federal Reserve credit line as it seeks independence from the government.The wider market’s gains were limited by the rising dollar and climbing bond yields after Tuesday’s agreement to extend the Bush-era tax cuts.Investors tried to gauge what was the primary cause of the rising rates – expectations of stronger economic growth or the resurfacing worries about inflation and the government deficit.The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,228.28, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,372.52 and the Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.4 per cent at 2,609.16.The materials sector lost 0.9 per cent with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold down 1.8 per cent to $108.60 and Cliffs Natural Resourcesdropping 2 per cent to $71.18.Elsewhere, Fortune Brands – which owns brands ranging from golf balls to Jim Bean whisky – gained 1 per cent to $61.76 after it said it planned to split itself into three separate businesses.The conglomerate will be divided into companies specialising in golf, home products and alcoholic drinks.Details of the plan, which is the result of a four-year strategic review, are expected to be finalised in the next several months.3M edged up 0.6 per cent to $84.05 as analysts weighed up the outlook given by the company on its investor day. On Tuesday shares in the industrial conglomerate declined after it forecast sales volumes at existing businesses would rise more slowly in 2011 than this year.Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation from “buy” to “neutral” and JPMorgan reiterated its “underweight” rating for 3M.“This is not about management as the durable 3M franchise is intact and has been enhanced through investment since chief executive [George] Buckley came aboard,” analysts at JP Morgan said. “This is more about an ongoing high level of expectations from a bullish sell side that has maintained stubbornly high estimates. We need to see some capitulation here.”In technology, Texas Instruments added 1 per cent to $33.75 after the US chipmaker narrowed its fourth-quarter profit and sales forecasts. But the reductions brought the company’s forecasts in line with analyst estimates and it said a recent correction in demand for its chips would be short-lived.Netflix’s chief financial officer, Barry McCarthy, resigned and will be replaced by David Wells, an internal appointment. Shares in the mail order online film rental service, which have soared 234 per cent so far this year, sank 0.8 per cent to $188.23.In retail, Home Depot edged higher by 1.4 per cent to $34.03 even though the home improvement retailer increased its full-year profit forecasts.
176;HD;Home Depot;2010-11-16T22:23:11Z;Show of retail strength fails to halt wider US retreat;;Concerns about the risks of Chinese inflation and Eurozone sovereign debt overshadowed increases in forecasts from US retailers Walmart and Home Depot.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 fell more than 1 per cent. The materials and energy sectors led the decline, losing more than 2 per cent as they followed commodity prices lower.The S&P 500 closed down 1.6 per cent at 1,178.36, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had also lost 1.6 per cent to close at 11,023.50 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.8 per cent lower at 2,469.84.However, a flurry of retailers reporting earnings helped the S&P 500 retail index limit its losses to just 0.6 per cent.Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales, added 0.8 per cent to $54.50 after it raised its full-year guidance. Earnings rose during the quarter as income from international operations jumped.Elsewhere in retail, Home Depot also lifted its full-year earnings outlook even though the home improvement retailer cut its forecast for sales growth.In the third quarter it outperformed Lowe’s as same-store sales increased 1.5 per cent compared with largely flat sales at its rival.Shares in Home Depot added 1 per cent to $31.71 while Lowe’s shares rose 0.5 per cent to $21.57.Saks and Nordstrom saw a rise in luxury spending. But Saks fell 1.4 per cent to $11.16 after it reported an unexpectedly high quarterly profit as sales rose. The high-end department store chain forecast a mid-single digit rise in sales during the fourth quarter.In contrast, department store owner Nordstrom narrowed its forecast for the full year to a range below average analyst expectations. Nordstrom shares dropped 3.1 per cent to $40.55 even though surging sales helped the retailer report a better-than-expected profit for the quarter.Liz Dunn, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said there could be upside to the retailer’s guidance if the high-end customer continued to show resilience.Competing department store stocks also fell, with Macy’s losing 2.2 per cent to $24.15 and Kohl’s nudging down 0.6 per cent to $50.65.Among other retailers announcing their earnings, clothing chain Abercrombie & Fitchbeat expectations.International demand helped Abercrombie & Fitch and the shares, which have risen 29 per cent since the retailer reported its second-quarter earnings in August, advanced 0.8 per cent to $45.68.Sales from the Urban Outfitters website and the fashion retailer’s catalogues jumped 31 per cent in its third quarter, helping total sales rise by double-digits and lifting the chain’s earnings above expectations. Shares in the chain rose 11.9 per cent to $36.64.
177;HD;Home Depot;2010-11-16T17:35:45Z;Overseas sales lift Walmart;;"Walmart, the largest retailer by revenues, saw strong sales and earnings in its expanding international business during the third quarter, helping offset continuing sluggish demand at its US stores.Mike Duke, chief executive, said the retailer’s international business remained “a key to future growth” for the retailer, which is engaged in a bid to acquire Massmart, a South African retailer.International sales outstripped Walmart’s domestic business during the quarter, rising 9.3 per cent to $26.9bn against the period a year ago, boosted by a foreign exchange gain of $349m.The retailer’s overall sales increased 2.6 per cent to $101.2bn.Walmart’s attempt to add to the 14 countries where it operates by buying Massmart has provoked opposition from South Africa’s retail workers’ union.Doug McMillon, head of Walmart International, said the company was “exploring a variety of options relating to ownership structure” at Massmart.In contrast to its robust international performance, sales at its US discount stores gained 1.4 per cent, and fell 1.3 per cent on a same-store basis, the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comparable sales.Walmart has blamed its sales declines on economic pressures facing its low-income customers and the impact of its efforts last year to reduce store inventories.Mr Duke said Walmart’s surveys showed that “financial uncertainties still weigh heavily on everyday Americans, including many of our core customers” and that spending at its more than 3,700 stores remained tightly linked to the timing of customers’ weekly pay cheques.The discounter’s performance contrasted with positive comparable sales reported by US department stores such as JC Penney and Macy’s, which target middle-income customers.Earnings rose 9 per cent to $3.44bn against a year ago, or 90 cents per diluted share, adjusted for an exceptional tax benefit, in line with Wall Street’s expectations.● Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, pushed up its full-year
earnings guidance while cutting its forecast for
full-year sales growth because of still-moribund demand. The retailer increased its full-year earnings forecast by 4 cents to $1.94 per diluted share, on an expected 2.2 per cent increase in sales, down from its previous forecast of a 2.6 per cent rise."
178;HD;Home Depot;2010-11-15T21:39:03Z;Deal activity fails to boost US stocks;;Deal activity including an $8.6bn move from Caterpillar failed to stop US stocks slipping late in the trading day.Caterpillar gained 1 per cent to $81.82 after the industrial equipment maker agreed to buy Bucyrus International in its largest deal ever.Bucyrus, which makes mining equipment, jumped 29 per cent to $89.80. The $8.6bn offer translates to $92 per share, a 32 per cent premium over the stock’s closing price last Friday.Other mining equipment companies also gained. Joy Global rose 7.5 per cent to $77.77, Terex climbed 2.9 per cent to $25.13 and CNH Global advanced 5.4 per cent to $44.94.Caterpillar shares have risen 44.1 per cent this year, but analysts at Morgan Stanley have a $100 price target on the stock.“Despite the rally in the shares, we still don’t think most folks believe Caterpillar can transform its operations and earn $8-$10 per share versus [its] last peak of $5.66,” said Robert Wertheimer, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “We think the signs of structural improvement are already there.”The wider indices spent most of the day in positive territory but were mixed by the close.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,197.75, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,201.97 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent lower at 2,513.82.In technology, EMC Corp, which makes storage computers, edged 1.2 per cent lower to $21.45 after it said it would acquire IsilonSystems for $2.25bn to gain its video storage equipment.The deal, at a 29 per cent premium to Isilon’s share price at the close last Friday, is the latest in data storage that has seen acquisitions by Dell and Hewlett-Packard in recent months. Shares in Isilon soared 28.5 per cent to $33.77.Speculation about other potential mergers also buoyed shares. Massey Energy, the US coalminer, added 0.9 per cent to $47.55 after it was reported that, if it decided to sell itself, ArcelorMittal would be interested in buying it. US-listed shares in ArcelorMittal nudged down 1.2 per cent to $34.28.In consumer industries, Fortune Brands, which makes everything from golf balls to Jim Beam bourbon, fell 2.2 per cent to $57.33 after it was reported it could be considering plans to break up with investor Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management.There was also news from ongoing takeover battles.Genzyme which makes treatments for rare genetic conditions, advanced 0.3 per cent to $70.03 after it was reported that it had started talks with Japanese company Takeda Pharmaceutical about a possible deal.The bid would be higher than the $18.5bn that French drugs group Sanofi-Aventis offered for the company in the summer. US-listed shares in Sanofi-Aventis lost 1.2 per cent to $33.60, while US-listed shares in Takeda Pharmaceutical slid 0.8 per cent to $23.55.BHP Billiton abandoned its three-month pursuit of PotashCorp, the fertiliser maker. The miner failed to secure the support of the Canadian government for its takeover bid. Shares in BHP gained 0.8 per cent to $87.69, while US-listed shares in PotashCorp fell by 1.9 per cent to $137.27.The S&P 500 retail index fell 1 per cent after US government figures showed retail sales excluding cars, petrol and building materials met expectations. But car sales helped the total figure beat expectations, rising 1.2 per cent.Ford gained 4.3 per cent to $17.00, its highest level of the past five years.Competitor General Motors is set to launch its initial public offering later in the week, allowing the US government to reduce its stake in the bailed-out carmaker.Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, said profit in the third quarter jumped 17 per cent as the company controlled labour costs. But sales were sluggish and shares in Lowe’s fell 1.1 per cent to $21.46 while rival Home Depot nudged down 0.2 per cent to $31.39.Investors shrugged off the Empire State index of business activity that showed manufacturing in New York state dropped in November to its lowest level since April 2009.
179;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Lowe’s profits rise 17%;;Lowe’s, the US home improvement retailer, reported almost flat comparable sales at its North American stores in its third quarter, as householders continued to hold back on new home projects.Lowe’s, which has more than 1,700 stores in North America, said comparable sales at rose just 0.2 per cent against the third quarter last year. Overall sales rose 1.9 per cent to $11.6bn. While sales were below analysts’ consensus expectations, it reported better than expected earnings of $404m, up 17.4 per cent from a year ago, or 29 cents per diluted share.Earnings were reduced by 2 cents per share by a charge related to the valuation of assets and the closure of two stores.Robert Niblock, chief executive, said the retailer had delivered “solid results . . . despite the continued sluggishness of the economic recovery”.“Ongoing uncertainty in employment and housing continues to pressure our industry, but we are prepared to operate effectively in a slow-growth environment,” he said.Lowe’s also offered a subdued forecast for the fourth quarter, saying it expected comparable store sales growth of no more than 2 per cent.Home Depot, Lowe’s larger rival, reports its third quarter results on Tuesday, as does Walmart, the largest US retailer.
180;HD;Home Depot;2010-10-11T19:58:45Z;Bain agrees $1.8bn Gymboree deal;;Bain Capital has agreed to acquire Gymboree, a US retailer of children’s clothing, for $1.8bn, in a move that reflects growing private equity interest in the slowly recovering US retail sector.Gymboree, which reported revenues last year of just over $1bn, operates 1,037 stores under the Gymboree, Crazy 8 and Janie and Jack brands, focused on toddlers and children under 12. It also has a network of mostly franchised children’s play locations, spanning some 30 countries outside the US.Jordan Hitch, a managing director at Bain, said it was attracted to Gymboree because of its “incredible brand strength and a large population of extremely satisfied customers”.Under Matthew McCauley, its chief executive since 2005, Gymboree successfully weathered the slump in consumer spending, improving margins and pursuing top line sales growth through its new lower cost Crazy 8 stores.It is also looking at international expansion, opening its first two Gymboree stores in Australia, and it signed a franchise agreement to establish itself in the Middle East, with plans for stores in Dubai. It also tested potential store locations in London in 2009.Bain has agreed to pay $65.40 per share, a 57 per cent premium to the retailer’s share price on September 30, before rumours of a possible transaction started to emerge, and a 23.5 per cent premium to its closing stock price at Friday’s close. Under the agreement, Gymboree has 40 days to consider any alternative offers.Michael O’Hara, of Consensus Advisors, a boutique investment bank focused on retail, said a rival retail bidder might be attracted by potential synergies between Gymboree’s toddler and elementary school focused business. “Even with a premium, Bain is still below historical valuations for a public company,” he said.Gymboree’s shares were up 22 per cent at $64.93 in afternoon trading in New York.Bain was one of the most active private equity groups in the surge in retail buyouts between 2005 and 2007, participating in the $6.6bn buy-out of Toys R US, and the $10bn buy out of Home Depot’s wholesale supply business.It also acquired Guitar Center stores in a $2.1bn deal in 2007 and Burlington Coat Factory, a discount retailer, in a $2.3bn deal in 2006.Bain Capital said it had committed financing from Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley to fund the transaction. Goldman Sachs advised Gymoboree.
181;HD;Home Depot;2010-08-30T21:39:43Z;Retailers and financials lead Wall St lower;;US stocks dropped on Monday after data showed personal incomes rose less than expected, raising questions about the sustainability of consumer spending.The S&P 500 closed down 1.5 per cent at 1,048.93, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.4 per cent to close at 10,009.95 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.6 per cent lower at 2,119.97.Figures on consumer spending and personal incomes kicked off a bumper week for economic data that culminates in the release of the non-farm payrolls report on Friday.Personal incomes rose less than forecast in July, climbing just 0.2 per cent compared with the projected 0.3 per cent. Even though consumer spending rose slightly more than expected at 0.4 per cent (compared with economists’ estimates of 0.3 per cent) the gap between the figures raised concerns that the rise in spending may not be sustainable.Stephen Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments, said that the data, although slightly below expectations, did not point to anything the market did not know already but simply highlighted the high rate of unemployment.“If you had to summarise the situation in three words it would be jobs, jobs and jobs. The market is predominantly focusing on jobs and the Federal Reserve is exclusively focused on jobs,” he said.He added that soon he expected many corporate earnings forecasts to be revised lower. “They’ll have to come down and be more in line with the economic growth outlook. The central scenario is sluggish, sloppy, ugly growth, [but] not a double-dip recession.”Shares fell further after President Obama failed to address economic concerns. In an afternoon speech, he said that he and his economic team had looked at ways to bolster the economic recovery, including tax cuts for businesses, but did not provide an action plan.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index fell by 1.8 per cent and the index of retailers was down 2.2 per cent. Ralph Lauren declined 3.5 per cent to $75.46, department store owner Nordstrom fell 5.2 per cent to $28.72 and Home Depot lost 2.6 per cent to $24.32.The financial sector suffered the most in the S&P 500, down 2.2 per cent, with AIG falling 3.4 per cent to $34.00, Wells Fargo sliding 3.1 per cent to $23.25 and US Bancorp 4.4 per cent lower at $20.71.In technology, Cisco fell 2.4 per cent to $20.32, Microsoft was down 1.3 per cent to $23.64 and Google lost 1.3 per cent to $452.69.Deal activity continued to dominate the market as both Intel and 3M completed acquisitions. Intel fell 2.2 per cent to $17.96 after Infineon Technologies agreed to sell its wireless chip unit to the company for $1.4bn. US-listed shares in Infineon, which is based in Germany, fell 5.6 per cent to $5.61.Cogent, which makes technology for biometric identification, rose 24.4 per cent to $11.09 after industrial conglomerate 3M said it had agreed to buy the company for $10.50 a share, or $943m. 3M was down 1 per cent to $80.20.United Airlines rose 1.3 per cent to $20.71 after the US government cleared its merger with Continental Airlines, which nudged up 0.4 per cent to $21.89. The deal is still waiting for shareholder approval.3Par, the “cloud computing” company at the centre of a battle between Hewlett-Packard and Dell, fell 2 per cent to $31.82 as the bidding war continued. 3Par’s board said on Friday that HP’s most recent bid of $2bn was a “superior proposal”. Dell, previously the favoured bidder, responded by saying it was assessing making another offer.Dell rose 1.1 per cent to $12.02. HP was buoyed after it authorised an additional $10bn for share buy-backs, on top of $8bn announced last November. HP gained 1.5 per cent to $38.56.In other deal news, Genzyme was up 3.4 per cent to $69.91 after it rejected an $18.5bn offer from Sanofi-Aventis as “unrealistic”.Sanofi-Aventis had reiterated the proposal it made a month ago. The Paris-based pharmaceutical company said Genzyme was refusing to discuss the offer and that it was prepared to take the bid hostile.US-listed shares in Sanofi-Aventis fell 1 per cent to $28.63.

Asian shares are gaining ground as upbeat US industrial production numbers cheer sentiment, but BHP Billiton, the Australian mining giant, is losing ground in the wake of its rejected bid for Canada’s Potash.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index is up 0.6 per cent, extending its winning streak to a fourth day, as investors respond to a rise on Wall Street driven by positive sales numbers from US retailers such as Home Depot and Wal-mart. Concerns about the US economic recovery eased after figures showing the country’s industrial output in July jumped twice as much as forecast.While uncertainty still clouds much of the US economy’s outlook, at least one sector of strength – manufacturing – is still expanding at a good enough clip to give pause to deflation fears. In July, producer prices rose in line with expectations, and industrial output grew 1 per cent.Japan’s Nikkei 225 has added 0.4 per cent, with Toyota, for whom North America is the biggest market, up 0.5 per cent. South Korea’s Kospi is up 0.3 per cent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index has advanced 0.4 per cent. BHP Billiton is down 3.5 per cent after Potash rejected its unsolicited offer.In the currency markets, the Japanese yen has resumed its rise. It is trading at 85.40 against the dollar from its 85.53 close in New York, moving back toward last week’s 15-year high of 84.72.In South Korea, KB Financial Group, the country’s leading retail lender, has risen 1.5 per cent. Samsung Heavy Industries, the world’s third-largest shipbuilder, is up 2.1 per cent while SK Energy has gained 2.3 per cent.On Tuesday, a levelling of economic fears, helped by a possible stimulus package in Japan and continuing industrial growth in the US, gave backbone to risk-takers.After jumping to historically low yield levels across the world, government bond prices were softer. Yields on benchmark US Treasuries and German Bunds were rising.The yen’s rise was also halted, with the Japanese currency falling against the US dollar. The FTSE All-World stock index was up 1.1 per cent, with Europe building off a higher start in Asia. The S&P 500 index closed up 1.2 per cent after rising as much as 1.7 per cent.Company news in part drove the strong flows into stocks. Potash, the Canadian fertiliser group, surged 28 per cent after it said that mining giant BHP Billiton made and “inadequate” $39bn approach. Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer, raised its full-year forecast and shares rose 1.2 per cent. M&T Bank led S&P 500 shares, after it renewed talks with Spain’s Santander to combine their operations in the US.Investors in particular seemed to be easing off their harsh judgment of European “peripheral” country risks. In a closely watched auction, Ireland sold all of its planned €5.1bn of four- and 10-year bonds, though it had to pay a higher-than-expected yield. But spreads of Irish yields versus German Bund yields have narrowed from near their crisis highs.“We saw quite strong auctions today, seeing especially Ireland performing quite well. Investors had found the spread was just too wide against German bonds,” said Lars Tranberg Rasmussen, senior analyst at Danske Bank.Earlier, Japan’s government was reported to be considering a fresh round of stimulus to help its flagging economy, as its quarterly gross domestic product growth has slowed to below-trend levels. Later in the day, the prime minister confirmed he would be meeting to discuss the outlines of a new package.Economists at Morgan Stanley raised their outlook for growth in China – now officially the second largest in the world– forecasting that the economy would indeed expand 10 per cent this year, as had been expected before the recent bout of slowing in the US, China and Europe.“In light of moderation in growth and receding inflationary pressures, we believe the policy cycle has troughed and will likely turn growth-supportive by [the fourth quarter]. In particular, the pattern of sequential growth momentum suggests that a soft landing is well under way,” wrote Qing Wang and Steven Zhang in a report.• Europe. The UK’s FTSE 100 index rose 1.4 per cent, with almost all sectors rising after the UK’s inflation report. The just-above-target pace of inflation raised hopes that the Bank of England would not raise rates to slow the economy. UK financials are leading the way, with HSBC rising 1.5 per cent.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index added 1.1 per cent. Germany’s Dax index was up 1.6 per cent, despite a downturn in German investor confidence. Irish shares were up 1.6 per cent, after falling nearly 6 per cent in the past two weeks following troubles in its banking sector. Allied Irish Banks shares were up 5.6 per cent and Bank of Ireland was 5.5 per cent higher.• Currencies. The yen was weaker against the dollar, down 0.2 per cent at Y85.49. Japan’s economics minister said the yen’s rise would need more than words to slow – the clearest threat yet of intervention, which could keep traders from extending the yen’s gains.A growing short position against the dollar – now at its biggest since 2009 – means that selling pressure will remain for the greenback. But it could also see a swift jump if shorts are forced to cover in a rapidly rising market.Risk appetite improved in commodity and growth markets. The Canadian dollar was up 1 per cent against its US counterpart, and the South Korean won was up 0.9 per cent against the US dollar.The euro was stronger against the dollar by 0.4 per cent to $1.2879, and stronger by 0.8 per cent against the Swiss franc following the peripheral auctions.Sterling began falling during US trading, and was down 0.6 per cent at 1.5576 against the dollar.• Debt. Stronger yields on short-term Spanish bonds further indicated an easing of fears for the eurozone “periphery”. Yields were lower than at the previous auction, and demand was much stronger. German Bunds were 3 basis points higher, off their record low yields reached on Monday, to 2.36 per cent.In the US, yields on 10-year US Treasuries were higher after falling almost 10 basis points on Monday – up 7 basis points to 2.63 per cent. Thirty-year bonds were also seeing higher yields, adding 5 basis points to 3.76 per cent. Parts of the US yield curve on Monday flattened to their lowest level since March 2009, a sign of sharply falling economic prospects.• Commodities. Benchmark US crude oil, which has closely tracked global economic sentiment of late, was up 0.6 per cent to $75.71 a barrel.Gold, pushing against a six-week high, was up a fraction at $1,225 an ounce. As monetary stimulus programmes are discussed, inflation hawks were pushing gold closer to its nominal highs seen earlier this year.Follow the Global Market Overview on Twitter: @telisdemos(Jamie Chisholm is on holiday)

Potash, the world’s largest fertiliser producer, described the proposal as “grossly inadequate”.“There’s nothing like a headline-grabbing takeover bid to get the “animal spirits” back up,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist for Prudential Financial.“Its odd because it is an Australian company going after a Canadian company but …it is that kind of potential deal which drives home the fact that companies have cash, that there is value and that there’s going to be growth globally.”US-listed Potash shares soared 27.7 per cent to $143.17, with US-listed shares of BHP Billiton falling 2.4 per cent to $70.21.Data showing production in the US rose more than expected in July pushed up shares in the materials and industrials sectors. Production climbed 1 per cent – more than double the average forecast.The S&P 500 materials index led the risers, up 2.3 per cent, with commodity stocks adding to Monday’s gains. Alcoa advanced 3.3 per cent to $10.95 and Cliffs Natural Resources jumped 4 per cent to $62.87.The industrials sector was up 1.8 per cent with Honeywell rising 2.9 per cent to $42.39 and Caterpillar climbing 1.8 per cent to $69.74.But investors shrugged off weaker than expected housing data with the S&P 500 homebuilders index rising 2.6 per cent, after falling 1.1 per cent on Monday on the back of a report showing housebuilder confidence fell.The S&P 500 retailers index rose 1.8 per cent after bellwether chains reported better than expected results and raised profit forecasts.Walmart rose 1.2 per cent to $51.02 after it posted a better than expected quarterly profit of 97 cents a share for the second quarter. On average, analysts had forecast profit of 96 cents a share. The company also raised its forecast for the full year to $3.95 to $4.05 a share from a previous projection of $3.90 to $4 on the back of cost cuts and international growth.But the world’s largest retailer said sales at US stores open for more than a year fell and warned that the consumer remained cautious.Home Depot also beat analysts’ estimates but sales missed expectations. Second-quarter earnings per share were 72 cents compared with the consensus forecast of 71 cents but sales missed forecasts.In contrast to competitor Lowe’s which said on Monday that full-year profit would come in below some analysts’ expectations, Home Depot raised its profit forecast. It said cost-cutting would boost profits but the home improvement chain also cut its sales forecast. Shares rose 3.4 per cent to $28.31.Fashion chains Urban Outfitters and Abercrombie & Fitch joined the list of retailers beating expectations.Urban Outfitters, reporting after the closing bell on Monday, said sales jumped 20 per cent in the last quarter, 7 per cent at stores open at least a year. Less discounting boosted margins and second-quarter profit rose 46 per cent. Shares rose 5.1 per cent to $32.95.But preppy clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch fell 6.9 per cent to $35.05 in spite of reporting better than expected second-quarter profit as discounts damaged profits and concerns about a rise in inventories weighed on the shares.TJX, the owner of retail chains including TJMaxx, rose 1 per cent to $41.78 after reporting a rise in profit as customers continued to flock to buy its discount designer brands.Saks, luxury retail chain, rose 2.6 per cent to $7.81 after reporting a second-quarter loss that was narrower than analysts estimated.
184;HD;Home Depot;2010-08-17T19:21:07Z;Home Depot sales rise in US stores;;Home Depot, the largest US home improvement retailer, yesterday reduced its sales growth forecast for the full year, saying an expected increase in demand from professional contractors had failed to materialise amid continued weakness in the housing market.The retailer, which operates almost 2,000 superstores across the US, cut its forecast for full-year sales growth to 2.6 per cent, from 3.5 per cent. But it left its earnings guidance essentially unchanged, saying it was continuing to see improvements in operating performance and was gaining market share.Lowe’s, its smaller and habitually more optimistic rival, on Monday stuck to its full-year sales outlook, saying it hoped a slow second quarter would be offset by increased demand as the economy recovers.But Frank Blake, Home Depot’s chief executive, said that despite the uncertain economic climate “we are seeing our business return to sales growth, and the hardest-hit parts of the country start to stabilise, so we will continue to invest and position our business for recovery”.The retailer reported that sales at its US stores rose 1 per cent on a comparable basis against the same period last year, its second consecutive increase in quarterly comparable sales after four years of falling sales.However, it saw continued weakness in high-value orders of $900 – one-fifth of its business – which were down 4.9 per cent against the quarter a year ago.Customers continued to focus spending on items such as plumbing and roofing repairs, or small flooring or bathroom improvements, rather than large discretionary projects.Craig Menear, head of merchandising, said the retailer was expecting to benefit in the second half of the year from customers spending on restoring lawns and grass after the hot summer. But overall, he said “we think that they will continue to focus on the maintenance and repair and simple updates around their homes”.Home Depot cut its forecast for full-year sales growth to 2.6 per cent from 3.5 per cent previously. But it raised its full-year earnings forecast by 2 cents to $1.90.Mr Blake noted that the retailer’s efforts to predict demand were becoming increasingly difficult because of volatility in the macroeconomic data, such as housing sales or housing repair investment, that it might traditionally have used.Like many US retailers, Home Depot has stopped opening new stores since the start of the recession and focused on improving the return of its existing network, through initiatives including establishing new regional distribution centres and efforts to improve store service.Home Depot’s shares, which rose above $35 after its first-quarter results in May, increased more than 4 per cent to $28.70.
185;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;US retailers;Japan shows shopping is a habit that may take longer to kick;"Shopping runs through Americans’ veins. When a culture rates buying stuff ahead of most other pursuits, a mere recession is not enough to get folks to suddenly go hiking or take up the piano. Japanese consumers didn’t change their ways when their bubble burst in 1990. Shoppers were then spending Y15,500bn a year; a full six years later total retail sales were just 3 per cent lower. Mrs Watanabe did eventually crack. Now Japan is trying to coax consumers back into shops again.The difficulty of breaking habits may explain the run of stronger results than expected this week from US retailers. Walmartclocks its growth internationally these days, but over the past 26 weeks, same-store domestic revenues to the end of July were flat. Similarly, comparable US sales at Home Depot were a couple of per cent higher in the second quarter versus last year. Rival home-improvement retailer Lowe’s also saw a pick-up, thanks to customers buying appliances as well as more essentials.Are US shoppers following the path of 1990s Japan? They may reach the same place eventually but their route is very different. Unlike the Japanese, Americans shut their wallets quickly when the financial crisis hit. From the peak in November 2007, retail sales fell by a 10th in 16 months. And whereas spending in Japan remained high for more than half a decade before heading southward, America’s initial fall has been followed by a remarkable turn. Absolute retail sales numbers have already retraced half the decline and year-on-year growth rates are now back to the 5 per cent levels of the mid-2000s.There are many reasons for investors to bet US consumption will soften again. But Japan is a reminder that shopping, like all habits, may take longer to kick than they think.E-mail the Lex team confidentially"

Asian stocks are under pressure as sentiment remains fragile amid growing concerns about the global economic recovery.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index is nearly flat at 118.15, while the Japanese market is being weighed down by a stronger yen. The Nikkei 225 is down 0.7 per cent.Government data on Monday showed that Japan’s economy expanded at an annualised 0.4 per cent pace in the April-June period, much slower than expected by economists.Softbank, Japan’s third-biggest wireless carrier, is down 1.7 per cent and KDDI, the country’s second-largest mobile-phone operator, has fallen 1.5 per cent. Nippon Electric Glass is down 4.1 per cent after Citigroup cut its recommendation on the liquid crystal display maker. However, Tokyo Electric Power is up 1.6 per cent as investors seek defensive stocks.The yen is trading at 85.26 per dollar from its 85.32 close in New York, having earlier in the morning risen as far as 85.11, not far from a 15-year peak of 84.72 reached last week.Against the euro, the yen is near a six-week high as investors seek safer assets. It has trimmed gains a bit to 109.43 per euro after earlier climbing to 109.07, the highest since July 1. It closed at 109.44 in New York.The rising yen is still causing concern for future Japanese growth, which has led to speculation that the Bank of Japan will keep it from holding below 85 against the dollar.Elsewhere, China’s Shanghai Composite is up 0.2 per cent, while South Korea’s Kospi has added 0.4 per cent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 has gained 0.4 per cent. In Malaysia, Malaysian Airlines has slumped 4.8 per cent after reporting a second-quarter loss.On Monday, the risks of a slowing global economy and potential deflation remained at the centre of traders’ attention, as government bond yields saw fresh lows.The selling began when Japan said gross domestic product grew at an annualised rate of just 0.4 per cent in the second quarter, much less than the 2.3 per cent growth forecast by economists. Japanese 10-year bonds fell to their lowest yield since 2003.In Europe, figures in the eurozone showed that energy and commodities were propping up inflation. Overall prices rose 1.7 per cent since last July, but core consumer prices fell 0.5 per cent in the past month – suggesting still-sluggish activity in many sectors.The US Empire State manufacturing survey index, an early-warning indicator that measures activity in the New York region for August, came in below forecast. A National Association of Homebuilders’ report also showed that in August confidence in the industry had fallen to its lowest since early 2009.All these only furthered bond traders’ perception of the risk of deflation amid slowing growth and the likelihood of further monetary easing. Government bond yields extended their declines since the US Federal Reserve said it would continue its “quantitative easing” programme of buying bonds.US 10-year bonds were at their lowest yield since March 2009, with their yield falling 10 basis points to 2.57 per cent. European benchmark German Bunds were down 6 basis points to yield 2.32 per cent, a fresh all-time low.“Consumer prices data has indicated the inflation picture is quite tame. And the disappointing NAHB and Empire survey suggest economic momentum is continuing to slow. That’s only added to the fundamental reasons to own Treasuries,” said Jessica Hoversen, research analyst at MF Global.Though the US consumer price index showed a month-to-month uptick– the first in four months – in a report on Friday, UK price rises are expected to slow. US producer prices are forecast by economists to have expanded at a faster rate, but US manufacturing and industrial economic data have consistently disappointed of late. Investors in inflation-protected bonds are very bearish on prices – so much so they have pushed the bonds’ prices negative.Anxiety about the US economy has been expressed in the dollar, as well as in bonds. Short positions on the greenback reached a 2010 high last week as investors fear that US interest rates may tip even lower. The dollar was falling against the yen and euro, though the euro was weaker against other benchmarks as European “periphery” worries remain.Pressure on the dollar was also coming from equity markets, where some investors were selling “haven” assets to buy stocks on the dip. The FTSE All-World stock index was up 0.3 per cent. The S&P 500 index reversed its losses as materials and technology companies rallied from lows to close up a fraction, though volumes are at their lowest 30-day average since February.☼ Factors to watch: The return of earnings? Big retailers Walmart and Home Depot, and PC-makers Dell and Hewlett-Packard, report this week. Earnings had helped give a floor to shares in July, when global stocks rose to three-month highs. However, at this point, with the growth story so much in focus, earnings may just not matter much unless they are blockbuster-good.The first of the bunch to report, home repair retailer Lowe’s, missed its own revenue projection and lowered its third-quarter earnings forecast. ☼• Europe. Shares were down, but did not have a strong direction. The UK’s FTSE 100 index added – barely – to its three-day rise. It was up fractionally as large miners and retailers offered support, with BP the biggest drag on the index.The broader Eurofirst 300 was down 0.1 per cent, dragged down by oil and gas and the utilities sector, while retailers outperformed following Hennes & Mauritz strong earnings. Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks are two of the top 10 decliners across Europe as they fight the perception that troubled loans may sink them. Ireland’s Iseq index was down 0.4 per cent and has now fallen 5.8 per cent since last week.• Currencies. The dollar extended its losses following the Treasury’s global capital flows data for June, which showed that China was again a net seller of Treasury bonds, leading to a net outflow of capital from the US.The greenback was lower against the yen by 1 per cent, at Y85.33. The yen has traded in a range of around Y85-Y86 since the Fed’s decision to continue its monetary stimulus programme, rather than beginning to wind it down as previously anticipated.The dollar turned lower against commodity currencies following the Treasury’s report. The Australian dollar was up 0.5 per cent against its US namesake. The euro extended its gains to 0.5 per cent to $1.2818, and the pound reversed a slight dip to rise 0.4 per cent against the dollar, to $1.5653.The euro, however, which was down 0.4 per cent on the Swiss franc, extended its losses. Germany’s strong GDP growth on Friday was not enough to erase worries about slowing Greek, Spanish and even French growth.• Debt. US 30-year bond yields were down 14 basis points to 3.72 per cent, their lowest since April 2009, while US two-year bonds were down 4 basis points to 0.49 per cent. The flatter curve suggested investors were now expecting a more prolonged recession that will keep rates lower for longer.Ten-year German Bund yields were down 6 basis points as European shares lose steam, at a record low yield of 2.32 per cent. Japanese 10-year bond yields were down 4 basis points to 0.94 per cent, a fresh seven-year low.Ireland, in the spotlight since Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks said that their bad loan portfolios were still under strain, has seen its credit-default swap prices and bond yields rise. The CDS market is pricing it as the second highest default risk of the so-called “peripheral” eurozone nations, behind Greece.Ireland’s 10-year bonds were now yielding 303 basis points more than German 10-years, just short of the 305-point peak in May. An auction of four- and 10-year bonds on Tuesday will be closely watched.• Commodities. US benchmark crude oil gave up gains, and was down 0.3 per cent at $75.15 a barrel, adding to one-month lows reached during Friday’s session.Gold was up 0.8 per cent to $1,225 an ounce, as bullion traders reacted to Japan’s GDP figures and priced in slower growth in the US, much of Europe and China. The precious metal has risen to two-month highs in the past week of trading.Following the Global Market Overview on Twitter: @telisdemos(Jamie Chisholm is on holiday)
187;HD;Home Depot;2010-08-16T18:05:18Z;Lowe’s expects fragile demand to remain;;Lowe’s, the US home improvement retailer, said it expected consumer demand to continue “to bounce along the bottom” in 2010, reflecting a “fragile consumer mindset” that was vulnerable to negative macro-economic news.Robert Niblock, chief executive, said that while the economic climate had improved compared with a year ago, customers at the company’s supercentres were continuing to take a cautious approach to spending on discretionary projects.“We don’t expect strong industry growth until we experience consistent improvements in the labour and housing markets, which will likely not happen until 2011,” he said.Lowe’s and its larger rival, Home Depot, were among the first US retailers to be affected by the slowing of the US housing market and subsequent economic recession, with their sales starting to fall in the summer of 2006. Both have returned to positive comparable store sales growth, and are closely watched as an indicator of US homeowner sentiment.But during the second quarter, Lowe’s comparable sales grew 1.6 per cent against the same period last year, below the company’s own expectations and slower than the 2.4 per cent growth reported in the first three months of the year.The company said stores in 19 out of its 23 regions recorded positive comparable sales.In spite of the wary tone, the retailer stuck to its forecast of a 2 per cent comparable sales increase for the current year, despite the ending of a government energy efficiency programme that has stimulated sales of home appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines.Mr Niblock noted that customers were saying in surveys that they were focusing spending on essential items, but that half of the projects they said they planned for the next six months were discretionary.“This inconsistency further indicates that consumers are uncertain about the macro environment as well as their personal financial situation,” he said.The retailer’s second-quarter sales increased 3.7 per cent from the same period last year to $14.4bn. It reported a 9.6 per cent increase in net income to $832m, with earnings per share of 58 cents.Lowe’s also tightened the range of its earnings per share forecast slightly to $1.38-$1.45.
188;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Opposition fades to big US land projects;;"The economic slowdown in the US has increased potential local support for new superstores, hospitals and even power plants, according to an annual survey of public attitudes towards big local land projects.Sixty-eight per cent of 1,000 adults surveyed in June by Saint Consulting, which specialises in land use approval politics, said they were more likely to support projects in their home towns because of the economy – up from 59 per cent last year.The fifth annual Saint Index found levels of potential support increased both for more popular local projects such as grocery stores and hospitals and the most unpopular, such as quarries, landfill sites and casinos.Patrick Fox, president of Saint, said that “over the past two years we are
seeing Americans more ready to accept development for economic reasons. We are looking at a good time for developers to start projects; they are going to have a better time enlisting support than they did before”.In a sign of the impact of the economy on planning decisions, Chicago’s city council last month ended several years of opposition to attempts by Walmart, the mass discounter, to open stores in its city.The decision was largely influenced by support from building unions and local community leaders who argued that proposed new stores would create more local jobs.Saint advises its clients both on how to win political support for new local projects in “site fights” before planning committees, and how to organise political opposition to
similar applications by rivals.Its latest survey again demonstrated Walmart’s success in reducing public opposition provoked by new stores, with 54 per cent of respondents saying they would oppose a new local store, down from 78 per cent in 2007, at the peak of an anti-Walmart campaign by the UFCW grocery workers’ union.But the 2010 survey found that a large Walmart is still likely to face more resistance than some of its main retail rivals, such as Target and Kmart, the discount stores, or Home Depot and Lowes, the home improvement retailers.In spite of the general declines in opposition levels, the index again found strong levels of nimbyism – or “not in my backyard” opposition to new developments – with 74 per cent saying they were opposed to any new projects in their community, unchanged from last year."
189;HD;Home Depot;2010-07-26T23:11:21Z;‘Golden parachute’ less inflated than US peers’;;"Anger at the size of Tony Hayward’s settlement package was as inevitable as his departure. But, compared with other senior executives who have left under a cloud,
Mr Hayward might consider himself hard done by.The £12m deal he is likely to receive from BP would consist of a year’s salary plus a £10.8m pension pot accrued during his 28 years at the company, which he could begin to draw on immediately if he wished.This pales in comparison with those negotiated by industry peers on both sides of the Atlantic.Lord Browne, Mr Hayward’s predecessor at BP, pocketed a retirement package worth £5.3m in addition to his annual pension of £1.05m a year after resigning after safety lapses presaging the Deepwater Horizon disaster and revelations that he had lied to a High Court judge.However, not all sins are equal and there seem to be few rules when it comes to determining a correct “disaster-to-pay-out” ratio.Philip Watts, former Shell chairman, got a £1m lump sum to supplement his pension when he left. Mr Watts had incurred the wrath of shareholders after the Anglo-Dutch company was forced to downgrade its oil reserves estimates.That anger was eclipsed by the outcry over the £16.9m pension pot Sir Fred Goodwin took when he left Royal Bank of Scotland.Sir Fred had announced his retirement a month before RBS reported losses of £24.1bn in 2008, the largest annual loss in UK corporate history.However, the pay-outs given to leaders of British companies are small change when compared with their US counterparts.In 2007, the end of Bob Nardelli’s tenure as chief executive at Home Depot was celebrated by shareholder activists angered that he had accepted pay rises while the retailer’s stock was falling. The sense of victory was damped, though, when Mr Nardelli walked away with a $210m severance package.In 2006, Lee Raymond said goodbye to his chief executive role at ExxonMobil, the largest listed international energy group, and took a retirement settlement of $351m. Some shareholders at the time tried to pass a resolution criticising the company’s executive pay policies.However, some leave with more modest rewards. In 2009 when Rick Wagoner punched out of General Motors, where he had been chief executive for nine years, he received just under $9m."
190;HD;Home Depot;2010-07-11T08:28:20Z;Invesco manager sees income investment gems;Large global companies deliver attractive yields to Invesco;Invesco Perpetual’s £129m (€155m, $196m) Global Equity Income Fund suffered a fourth-quartile debut year against its peers in the global growth sector, with the market led by poor quality and dividend-cutting stocks.Manager Paul Boyne says the group’s long-held view is that low interest rates, quantitative easing and other expansionary programmes are a symptom of western problems rather than the basis of sustainable economic recovery.“Removal of this ‘state aid’ will pose significant challenges for economies and markets into 2011 as the true state of unaided economic growth becomes apparent,” he adds.“We see little evidence of a sustainable pick-up in developed market consumption growth, as consumers and lenders are deleveraging and persistent unemployment may impair a durable recovery.”This perspective – and the group’s focus on valuation – has meant little exposure to areas where a cyclical recovery is discounted into share prices.In contrast to a fairly bearish macro view, Mr Boyne is generally positive on markets, especially with regard to income investment. “Companies have aggressively reduced costs and today we see many with low debt and very high cashflow, the inverse of the household sector,” he says.“Many sectors currently offer yields in excess of historic averages and we continue to find companies that have well-covered dividends.”Despite a year of material and often painful dividend cuts, he highlights good experience of the opposite, with companies including Home Depot and United Technology increasing distributions.Over the first months of 2010, the fund’s best relative sector performances came from industrials, financials and information technology, and the worst from materials and telecom services. Mr Boyne says the negative impact of his high exposure to telecom services was more than countered by low exposure to financials and overweight positions in industrials and consumer staples.“The relative underperformance of many less cyclical sectors has left large sections of the market looking attractively priced and coincidentally, many of these areas also pay high dividend yields,” he says.“In a world where we believe interest rates will have to remain low to support beleaguered western economies, the attraction of sustainable dividend yields above cash rates, and in many cases also above current corporate bond yields, cannot be ignored.”With the west retrenching, Mr Boyne says it is important to remember economic expansion and capital formation in many emerging countries is redefining the global economy.“What we are seeing today is that large global companies are able to orientate their businesses towards these markets and are investing significantly for growth,” he says.As income investors, the team is concerned with identifying sustainable cashflows and undervalued businesses and sees many such opportunities in current conditions.One recent addition is Automatic Data Processing, for example, which serves thousands of corporate clients globally, providing payroll and other workplace solutions.“We were attracted to its predictable recurring revenues that deliver sustainable cashflows,” Mr Boyne says.James Smith is a freelance journalist who writes for Investment Adviser

Because of this, today’s trading may be a key bellwether for markets heading into earnings season,” he added.The non-manufacturing ISM index unexpectedly fell to 53.8 last month from 55.4 in May. A reading over 50 indicates expansion.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent to 1,028.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 9,743.62 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,093.88.US-listed shares in BP added 8.7 per cent to $31.91 after the company said it could meet the costs of its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico without issuing new shares, rejecting recent speculation that it was seeking a bail-out from a strategic investor.The company has launched an appeal for support to Middle Eastern and other international investors, arguing that its shares are good value after their near-50 per cent fall since the Deepwater Horizon disaster on April 20.Chipmakers were higher after the Semiconductor Industry Association said global sales climbed 4.5 per cent in May from the previous month.Micron Technology was up 1.6 per cent to $8.35 and SanDisk added 0.7 per cent to $41.77.Goldman Sachs gained 0.9 per cent to $132.26 as the financial services giant was upgraded to “overweight” at JP Morgan. The way the bank measures risk and allocates capital should be seen as a model for other investment banks, the analysts said.Regional bank stocks were among the session’s strongest performers. Regions Financial climbed 2.7 per cent to $6.41, Fifth Third Bancorp was 1.9 per cent higher at $12.04 and PNC Financial gained 1.9 per cent to $56.74.Cliffs Natural Resources was down 5.1 per cent to $44.49 after North America’s largest iron ore producer agreed to buy the coal operations of privately held INR Energy for $757m.The energy sector was one of the strongest performers on Tuesday. Peabody Energy, the largest US coal company, added 3.3 per cent to $40.26, Massey Energy advanced 2.7 per cent to $27.02.Monsanto, the world’s largest seed maker by market value, was one of the session’s worst performers as it dropped 3.1 per cent to $45.12. The European Union’s highest court on Tuesday said the company cannot use the European patent on its Roundup Ready soyabeans variety to block Argentine soy meal imports into the EU. The decision is binding across the region and cannot be appealed.Oshkosh was up 1.3 per cent to $30.38 as the maker of speciality vehicles won contracts worth $691m to supply the US army with tactical trucks and trailers, the US defence department said late last Friday.Consumer staples stocks struggled to participate in the rally. The group was led lower by Best Buy, which dropped 2.2 per cent to $33.13. Home Depot fell 1.5 per cent to $27.34, Supervalu declined 1.3 per cent to $10.57 and Costco erased 0.4 per cent to $54.Walgreen, a drugstore chain, advanced 1 per cent to $26.62 after it said revenues at stores open at least a year increased 2 per cent last month, topping the 1.1 per cent rise expected by analysts on average.The company, which bought rival Duane Reade, earlier this year, said pharmacy same-store sales rose 1.8 per cent.The Vix index, a measure of volatility, was up 0.7 per cent to 30.33.Netflix, an online movie rental company, rallied 0.2 per cent to $107.27 after it said it had struck an agreement with Relativity Media, a film financing group that owns the rights to up-coming releases including Season of the Witch and The Fighter.Netflix will stream Relativity’s films after their DVD release, bypassing premium pay-television services such as HBO and Showtime.

Pulte Group was down 3.2 per cent to $8.86, Toll Brothers fell 3.2 per cent to $17.06 and DR Horton lost 3 per cent to $10.22. Home Depot, a home improvement retail chain, dropped 2.6 per cent to $30.61.Walgreen lost 6.5 per cent to $28.17 as the drugstore chain posted a fiscal third-quarter profit of 53 cents per share excluding some items, falling short of the 58 cent per share average analyst estimate.Rival Rite Aid fell 2.9 per cent to $1.01 and CVS Caremark declined 1.2 per cent to $31.40.Intel fell 1 per cent to $20.98 even as the company and the Federal Trade Commission indicated that they may soon reach an out-of-court settlement on an antitrust case, filing a joint motion to suspend administrative trial proceedings until July 22.If the agreement is accepted, it will head off a September trial that would have likely put the spotlight on Intel’s relationships with Dell, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.Apple led the technology stocks higher as the company announced that it had sold 3m iPads in 80 days, sending its stock 1.4 per cent higher to $273.85.The stock’s target price estimate was raised to $375 from $350 at Deutsche Bank.

The company also expected its exports to jump 65 per cent.Analysts said that the stock had risen 17.6 per cent over the past two weeks, suggesting that the good news was priced in.Big Lots, a close-out retail chain, was down 8 per cent to $31.56 after the stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “overweight” at JPMorgan.Rival discounter Family Dollar Stores declined 1.5 per cent to $38.45.

Before the deadline, Mr Romeyn’s business benefited as retirees were able to sell their homes more easily, allowing them to move into his adult communities.Now the tax credit has run out, that momentum has slowed dramatically. “In the last four weeks I’ve seen very weak traffic and weaker activity,” says Mr Romeyn. “It’s not encouraging and it means we’ll have to work even harder to convince people to move forward with their purchases.”In May, new residential home construction in the US fell by 10 per cent to a seasonally adjusted rate of 593,000 units, its lowest level in five months, the commerce department said last week. Economists expected to see an impact from the ending of the tax credit, but not such a steep drop.If the weakness continues, the likely conclusion will be that the tax credit brought forward demand from aspiring homeowners but failed to spur a more fundamental improvement in the housing market. The next big test will be new home sales data out on Tuesday. Economists fear the US housing market could be on the verge of a “double dip” – or even a “triple U”, given the fall in new construction over the winter.“We are going to have a very sluggish time over the summer,” says Kevin Logan, chief US economist at HSBC in New York.One of the biggest restraints on the housing sector is persistently high unemployment. With joblessness at 9.7 per cent, and expectations that it will improve only gradually over the course of this year and next, homeownership will remain an elusive goal for many Americans. This is particularly true given that credit conditions for home loans remain tight, with many buyers expected to pay at least 20 per cent in equity up front – a huge difference compared to the boom years when mortgages were easy to secure.Meanwhile, home prices have continued to drop as many houses are being sold out of foreclosure or at distressed values. According to the widely followed Standard and Poor’s/Case-Shiller index, home prices across the US actually rose by 2 per cent over the year to March. However, they fell in the fourth quarter of last year by 1 per cent, and the pace of decline accelerated to 3.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year.Mr Logan says falling prices remove one of the main motivations for people to buy a house, which is the chance to own a home that is also a good investment.On the other hand, homes are becoming more affordable. Not only are prices falling but the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage has dropped close to historic lows. Last week it stood at 4.75 per cent compared with 5.38 per cent a year ago, according to Freddie Mac.Even so, Michael Fratantoni, vice-president of research and economics at the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington, believes the overall economic picture and sustained job creation are more important to housing demand than affordability. “No one is going to want to buy a home based on a temp job,” he says.Back in the south, where the drop in housing starts was 20 per cent in May, the most of any region, the mood is grim. Chuck Fowke, a builder of luxury homes based in Tampa Bay and president of Florida’s homebuilders’ association, says of the tax credit expiration: “It brought people out prematurely and now we’re taking it on the chin.”

Things don’t always go smoothly.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent to 1,116.03, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 10,434.17 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher to 2,307.16.AOL advanced 1.7 per cent to $22.65 after the company sold Bebo, its social-networking site, to Criterion Capital Partners, a California private investment firm, for less than 2 per cent of what it paid for the site. It expects to record a tax benefit this quarter of $275m to $325m from the sale. The media company bought Bebo for $850m two years ago.US-listed shares in BP were 0.4 per cent lower at $31.71 as Tony Hayward, chief executive, testified to Congress.Shares in DryShips dropped 5.1 per cent to $4.09 after the dry bulk carrier vessel operator, which owns ultra-deep water drilling rigs, was downgraded from “outperform” to “neutral” at Credit Suisse and the share price target lowered from $8 to $5.The broker said that “given all of the uncertainty following the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, we expect a continued soft patch for the deep water rig sector in the near term”.JM Smucker, which makes Smucker’s jams and Jif peanut butter, advanced 6.6 per cent to $61.55 as the company said it expected full-year profit of at least $4.50 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $4.39 per share.Consumer staple stocks were some of the session’s best performers. Kroger, a supermarket chain, rallied 3.3 per cent to $20.75; Supervalu gained 6.1 per cent to $13.24; while General Mills climbed 1.6 per cent higher to $38.93.Pier 1 Imports, a retailer of imported furniture, added 2.2 per cent to $8.20, after it posted quarterly profit of 7 cents per share, compared with an expected 2-cent loss.M&T Bank Corp was up 9 per cent to $89.34. Matias Rodriguez Inciarte, the deputy chairman at Santander, the eurozone’s largest bank by market capitalisation, said it had held talks to merge its US operations with M&T, but declined to make further comment.Annaly Capital Management, a New York real estate investment trust, declined 0.5 per cent to $17.50 as the stock was lowered from “buy” to “neutral” at Sterne Agee.Toll Brothers retreated 4 per cent to $18.03 as the largest US luxury homebuilder said deposits in the past three weeks were about 20 per cent lower compared with last year.“Concerns about the financial crisis in Europe and escalating regional political tensions, coupled with worries about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and its effects on the economy and the environment have negatively impacted the outlook of American consumers,” said Joel Rassman, chief financial officer.Homebuilders and housing-related stocks were among the biggest fallers. Pulte Group dropped 2.5 per cent to $9.51, DR Horton fell 2.7 per cent to $10.94 and KB Home lost 3 per cent to $12.54.Home Depot, a home improvement retail chain, lost 0.7 per cent to $31.91. Rival Lowe’s retreated 2.2 per cent to $22.68 and Bed Bath & Beyond fell 0.9 per cent to $37.82.Winnebago Industries added 11.9 per cent to $12.40 as the motor-home maker posted a fiscal third-quarter profit of 21 cents per share, beating forecasts.First Solar gained 3.9 per cent to $123.45 as the world’s largest manufacturer of thin-film solar power modules was upgraded from “neutral” to “outperform” at Credit Suisse."
195;HD;Home Depot;2010-06-07T02:06:07Z;Target gloomy on storecards;;Target, the US discount retailer, says it expects the outstanding balances on its customers’ store-branded credit cards to drop to levels not seen since 2005, highlighting the rapid fall in the supply of consumer credit in the wake of the financial crisis.In a sign of the reshaping of the US credit landscape, Target says it expects its credit card receivables to drop to an annual average of $5bn-$6bn over the next few years - compared to a peak of $9.1bn seen at the end of 2008.But as its credit card portfolio shrinks, Target is also refocusing its strategy in a way that reflects the changing dynamics of a business that handles more than $55bn in consumer debt on cards issued by more than 165 retailers.Gwenn Bézard, a consultant at Aite Group, said Target was “trying to refocus on using their credit card to lift sales, rather than making money from it”.“Before they were saying ‘this is a big business’ - now it is: ‘we need to cut down our risk profile and go back to the original objective of the product’.”Retailer-branded credit cards, which have higher penalty charges than bank cards, were among the first obligations to be abandoned by consumers as the recession deepened last year.Their performance was worse than bank cards, with “charge-off rates” for bad debts - that is the write-offs linked to payment defaults - running at 13.23 per cent in February, according to Fitch Ratings.This compared with 11.1 per cent for its index of bank-issued cards. Retail card charge-offs before the recession ran in the 5 to 6 per cent range.Two of the largest retail card operators - Citigroup and GE Money - have both sought unsuccessfully to sell off their consumer card businesses, which include cards for Home Depot and Lowe’s.Kohl’s, the discount department store, is building up cash holdings to cover the possibility of buying back its credit card receivables when a $1.6bn agreement with JPMorgan Chase expires next March.Citigroup also terminated a credit card agreement with ZTargetales, the jewellers, this year.With sales of $63bn last year, Target is a significant issuer of credit cards through its Target National Bank. Like rivals, it tightened credit conditions on its cards in the recession.In April, it stopped offering Visa cards that could be used anywhere, restricting new applications to ones that can be used only at its own stores.
196;HD;Home Depot;2010-05-21T00:34:56Z;Sears suffers as Gap mends its bottom line;;Sears Holdings continued to underperform its rivals during the first quarter as it failed to capitalise on improved consumer sentiment and a government-backed surge in household appliance sales.The owner of Sears department stores and Kmart, the discounter, said operating income from its more than 3,900 stores in the US and Canada fell about 25 per cent to $98m against the same period last year. Aggressive price promotions on appliances and lower profits on home electronics at Sears stores had hit gross profits.Comparable sales at Sears department stores rose 1.2 per cent from last year, as sales of fridges and washing machines were boosted by a trade-in scheme aimed at supporting energy efficiency and supported by the government.Sears’ Kenmore brand, the best-selling US home appliance name, has been facing increasing competition from rivals including Home Depot, Lowe’s and Best Buy.The same-store sales gain at Sears stores was the first since it was taken over by Kmart in 2005, in a transaction led by Eddie Lampert, the billionaire hedge fund owner who is now chairman of the combined company.However, Gary Balter, retail analyst at Credit Suisse, described the results as disappointing given the improved performances of most of the group’s main rivals.“Sears was very aggressive in promotions to grow their leading appliance market share, but could not convert that to sell higher-margin products as well,” Mr Balter said.Under Mr Lampert, Sears has cut back on expenses and reduced capital spending on its stores to a level that many retail analysts argue could jeopardise its attempts to win back customers and regain market share.Sears invested $95m in capital spending during the quarter. In contrast, Target, the discounter, invested over $400m in remodelling and new stores.Sears’s 1,320 Kmart stores, accounting for 35 per cent of revenues, reported increased comparable sales, up 1.7 per cent against a year ago, and the third consecutive quarter of growth.Total revenues for the quarter were flat at $10bn. Earnings fell 38 per cent to $16m, or 14 cents per diluted share.Sears’ woes contrasted with the improvement during the quarter at Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer.Gap continued its recovery from several years of declining sales, reporting a 4 per cent increase in same-store sales against a year ago, with gains across its Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic brands.The retailer said net earnings rose 40 per cent to $302m, or 45 cents per diluted share, supported by improved gross margins and stronger operating profits. Gap also said it was building up inventory levels, in a sign of growing confidence in stronger consumer spending.
197;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Walmart struggles while Home Depot thrives;;"The uneven recovery in US consumer spending was underlined on Tuesday by quarterly results from Walmart and Home Depot, which suggested that purchases by low-income Americans were still lagging the pick-up in expenditure by middle-class shoppers.Walmart, which has stores aimed primarily at lower- income shoppers, reported its fourth consecutive quarter of falling US comparable sales with a 1.4 per cent drop during its first quarter.It cited “soft customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in average ticket” for the decline.Mike Duke, chief executive, said the US performance was below expectations. “Economic pressures, including gas prices and concerns about unemployment, continue to affect key
segments of retail and this is especially true for Walmart’s core customer,” he said.But Mr Duke also said Walmart’s efforts to trim its range of products had affected sales, saying it was restoring merchandise on a “fast track”.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Walmart’s US operations, said the retailer had seen a significant increase in the use of food benefit stamps during the quarter.He said monthly surveys showed that customers were making fewer trips to Walmart because of concerns over petrol prices, which he said were up 41 per cent against the same time last year.The retailer warned it expected comparable store sales growth during its current quarter, without fuel, to be between a 1 per cent increase and a 2 per cent decline, compared with a 1.5 per cent decline last year.Walmart saw its sales surge as the economy slumped last year and it attracted more
prosperous, although frugally minded, shoppers to its US stores.But its sales growth has now stagnated at a time when more upmarket shops, such as traditional department stores, have benefited from increased discretionary spending.In contrast, Home Depot on Tuesday reported the first rise in US same-store sales since 2006, when it was one of the first US retailers to be hit by the impact of the slowdown in the housing market.Comparable sales at its US stores rose 3.3 per cent.Home Depot’s total sales rose 4.3 per cent to $16.9bn.The retailer’s earnings grew more than 21 per cent to $725m, or 43 cents per diluted share, against the same period last year.Walmart’s total net earnings increased 10 per cent to $3.3bn, or 88 cents per diluted share, 3 cents above its latest guidance.Total sales rose 6 per cent to $99.1bn, supported by a 21 per cent rise in international sales."

After four years of comparable sales declines for the world’s largest DIY chain, Home Depot on Tuesday reported year-on-year growth of 5 per cent for the first quarter. Smaller competitor Lowe’s announced the first growth in its western region for five years on Monday. Is the US retailing recovery on solid ground?The consumer certainly is starting to increase spending: commerce department figures released last week show retail sales increasing for seven months in a row. And a range of results from speciality retailers to department stores confirm growing momentum. Yet soft spots in the rebound remain. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, on Tuesday reported comparable sales down 1.4 per cent. The discounter’s customers, primarily the poorer households of America, are still struggling.Meanwhile, the recovery in sales at Home Depot came largely from seasonal merchandise. Shoppers are willing to spruce up gardens but are not yet confident enough to be attempting big renovations. The professional contractor segment, which contributes just under a third of Home Depot revenues, is still shrinking. If, as seems likely given the backlog of foreclosures, house prices start falling again, DIY demand would soften also.Earnings are also rebounding more slowly than might be hoped as costs, under tight control throughout the recession, start to rise. Home Depot’s operating margin rose only 86 basis points on last year, to 7.7 per cent, as central expenses edged up. Lowe’s and Dick’s Sporting Goods, which also reported on Tuesday, saw such inflation take the edge off improvements at the cash register as well.

199;HD;Home Depot;2010-05-18T11:31:48Z;Home Depot quarterly profits surge 21%;;Home Depot, the largest US home improvement retailer, on Tuesday reported the first increase in same-store sales at its US stores for almost four years, reflecting the improving confidence of US homeowners.Comparable sales at its 1,700-plus US superstores, which broadly reflect the health of the housing market, rose 3.3 per cent, the first year-on-year increase in US same-store sales since sales started falling in 2006.Including stores in Mexico, Canada and China, Home Depot’s stores saw a 4.8 per cent increase in same-store sales during its first quarter against last year, ahead of Wall Street’s expectations.Total sales rose 4.3 per cent to $16.9bn. Excluding the impact of sales at its closed EXPO home design unit in the US, sales rose 5.7 per cent.The retailer reported earnings rose over 21 per cent to $725m, or 43 cents per diluted share, against the same period last year. Excluding a $33m charge related to a loan guarantee, and last year’s $73m charge for the closure of EXPO, earnings rose 29 per cent to $758m.Frank Blake, chief executive, said in a statement the retailer had seen a “solid start to the year …driven by great performance in seasonal categories and strong growth in customer transactions”.The retailer raised its forecast for sales growth for this year, to around 3.5 per cent, up from 2.5 per cent, and forecast a 21 per cent increase in earnings per dilute share, to $1.88, up from $1.76 previously.Under Mr Blake, who took over as chief executive in 2007, Home Depot has sold off its wholesale supply business as well as a number of underperforming units, and stopped the expansion of its US store network.Home Depot’s smaller rival Lowe’s also reported strong first-quarter results on Monday, with sales up 4.7 per cent to $12.39bn, and same-store sales up 2.4 per cent. But Robert Niblock, its chief executive, expressed caution about the economic outlook, saying he expected 2010 to be a year of transition, and did not expect a return to significant growth until 2011.Both retailers benefited during the quarter from incentives for US consumers to trade in home appliances for more energy efficient models, and from an increase in lumber prices.Lowe’s also said it saw strong demand for discretionary items such as riding mowers and gas grills, and stronger-than-expected demand for bigger ticket items in its kitchen and bath departments.“Consumers are showing signs of re-engagement in home improvement, including discretionary projects and purchases of bigger-ticket products, which had taken a back seat during the worst of the economic downturn,” Mr Niblock said.
200;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Wall St flat after weak industrial report;;Wall Street investors shifted into defensive sectors as disappointing manufacturing figures and hovering regulators added to its already cautious mood.The market reversed earlier losses to end the day flat. Advances were led by consumer staples and telecom companies, while energy and industrial shares led the declines.“The equity market may be transitioning from last year’s ‘high-octane’ rally to a ‘regular’ or ‘unleaded’ rally driven by a mixture of later- and counter-cyclical sectors,” said Barry Knapp, portfolio strategist at Barclays Capital.After falling by as much as 1.3 per cent, by close the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent to 1,136.94. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 0.3 per cent to 2,354.23, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was marginally higher at 10,623.18.The Vix index of volatility declined slightly but remained elevated at 31, still above its 2010 average.Deal activity provided some support. Pactiv, a food service and packaging company, jumped 19 per cent to $28.44 after it was reported that Apollo, a private equity group, was interested in taking it private.Competitor Sealed Air, a manufacturer of speciality packaging, also jumped 5.6 per cent to $22.32 as investors anticipated further activity in the space.Pharmaceutical groups OSI and Astellas moved closer to finalising a deal, with Japan’s Astellas agreeing to acquire the US oncology specialist for $4bn. But OSI shares declined 4.1 per cent to $57.35 after arbitrageurs cut holdings to bring its price in line with the reported deal terms.The sense of a peak was sparked by an Empire State manufacturing survey that was lower than expected. The Federal Reserve’s general economic index of the New York region dropped to 19.1 from a cyclical high of 31.9 in April, as both new orders and shipments of goods declined.“The first look at manufacturing for the month of May does hint that we may be seeing the first signs of slowing in the rapid manufacturing expansion,” said Zach Pandl, desk economist at Nomura Securities in New York.Purveyors of consumer staples were the top performers, rising 0.6 per cent as a group. Kraft gained 1.8 per cent, Procter & Gamble gained 1.4 per cent, and Walmart added 1.2 per cent.Also seeing gains amid investors’ cyclical shift were sellers of prepaid mobile phones. MetroPCS jumped 3.8 per cent to $9.05. Sprint Nextel’s CFO said its revenue declines were easing as the market for prepaid phones was “improving dramatically”. Shares added 3 per cent, to $4.49.Cyclical industrials led the decliners in the Dow. Alcoa, the global metals group, dropped 2.1 per cent to $12.10. Caterpillar, supplier of construction and farming equipment, fell 1.7 per cent to $63.78.There was some optimism, however. ProLogis, a real estate investor in factories, jumped 4.3 per cent, to $12, after it was upgraded from “sell” to “buy” by Citigroup. “[I]ndustry fundamentals are poised to surge given increased industrial production, global GDP and historically low construction starts,” said Michael Bilerman, analyst at Citi.Lowe’s, the do-it-yourself home retailer, dipped 3.1 per cent after it lowered its forecast for 2010. Shares were trading at $25.26. Rival Home Depot was up 1.1 per cent to $35.39.Massey Energy, owner of the Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, West Virginia, where 29 miners were killed in an explosion, led the drop in energy stocks after the US Department of Justice said it was launching a criminal probe.Massey shares dropped 10 per cent to $33.29. Peabody, the US’s biggest coal miner, dropped 5.3 per cent to $39.61. Citigroup led a decline across banking. A provision that banks should spin off their swaps operations remained in the US financial reform bill, in spite of Wall Street’s lobbying efforts.Citi was down 4 per cent, to $3.82, its lowest level since early March. S&P 500 financial shares were broadly down 1.2 per cent.American Express shares added 1.4 per cent to $41.22 after it reported the steepest drop in delinquent consumer loans. Amex said charge-offs declined from 7.5 per cent in March to 6.7 per cent in April.
201;HD;Home Depot;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Big names prove worth in crisis;;"For companies whose financial value depends heavily on the health of their brands, the severity and abruptness of the recession was a challenge.The abruptness with which many consumers stopped spending, and large companies reduced capital investment and wound down capital investment, caused a shock to the system. Many companies experienced not only the financial crisis, but also a crisis of confidence.Marketers and advertising agencies preach the gospel that the companies that emerge best out of recessions are those that maintain their marketing budget and protect brands when the going gets tough. In practice, few companies were certain enough of the future to comply.Yet some of the Doomsday scenarios about the value of brands in a new, less leveraged world, have not come to pass. Emerging from the recession, luxury goods companies and many other consumer brand companies are enjoying a rebound.The underlying value of any brand – the premium commanded by products and services with strong reputations and identities – has not been eliminated by the crisis. Even those companies that did not invest heavily in their portfolio in the worst times are regaining some confidence.Indeed, this year’s BrandZ brands survey suggests that, even if the value of brands is below its 2007 peak, it has rebounded more sharply than the S&P 500. Millward Brown Optimor, the WPP subsidiary that compiles the ranking, calculates that a portfolio of the top 100 brands – updated each year as a new list is compiled – is 18.5 per cent up from its level four years ago, compared with an 11.5 per cent fall in the S&P 500.The premium for the top 100 brands was squeezed as many countries went into recession but it opened up again coming out. In other words, the outlook for brands has not been fundamentally altered as a result of the recession; instead, it looks familiar.“Brands outperform in good times and when there is a recession they do go down, but they come out the other side with a sustainable advantage,” says Joanna Seddon, chief executive of MBO.The nature of brands continues to evolve. Technology rather than marketing is now the defining characteristic of seven of the top 10 brands, with Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Marlboro making up the other three.Google remains the world’s most valuable brand, but edging up close behind it are two other technology companies, IBM and Apple. Both of these outrank Microsoft, whose brand value was stable during the year.Meanwhile, China Mobile, General Electric and Vodafone occupy the lowest three places in the top 10, which comprises the same brands as last year’s ranking. Although GE’s brand value fell by 25 per cent from $59.8bn in the list published a year ago, due mainly to its difficulties with GE Capital, the technology and infrastructure-related parts of its business retain their strength.The resurgence in Apple under Steve Jobs, through the iPod, the iPhone and now the iPad, continues unabated and, on present trends, it could be pressing Google for first place within a year or two. That is a tribute to a company that inspires devotion among customers.It may also be a reflection of the value of inspirational leadership, and the way in which consumers identify some of the world’s most valuable brands, such as Oracle and Starbucks, with founders who embodies their qualities. Larry Ellison of Oracle and Howard Schultz of Starbucks are not only the founders but keepers of the flame.This broad shift towards technology is a reflection of the importance of the internet and communications in the fortunes of many companies, including Telcel, the mobile phone group controlled by Carlos Slim Helu. Telcel is the first Mexican company to enter the top 100 (in 69th place).The social media boom led by companies such as Facebook and Twitter – as well the rise in smartphones led by Apple – has had a broader impact on the top 100. It has boosted mobile operators such as Verizon and AT&T, despite the complaints of iPhone users about AT&T’s 3G coverage.Although mobile phone companies are struggling to upgrade their data networks, the trend towards the mobile internet is giving them valuable revenue opportunities. “Everyone is twittering and sending pictures on iPhones, and data is what makes money,” says Ms Seddon.Yet technology can also disturb traditional brand values and make it easier for young competitors to break into markets. The best example of that at the moment is the media industry, where technology companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple dominate distribution.That is causing problems for media conglomerates with old-established brands in film, television and print. They are facing similar problems to the consumer goods companies that confront powerful discounting distributors, particularly Walmart.Apart from the influence of technology, the biggest secular shift in brand value is the continuing rise of emerging market brands. Some 13 of the top 100 brands now come from emerging markets, with seven of these from China. In the 2006 ranking there was just one emerging-market brand – China Mobile.For the moment, most of these brands tend to be based on finance or resources, with banks such as ICICI of India and China Construction Bank, and energy companies such as PetroChina and Petrobras combining both financial value and a large domestic market.One reason for the two latter groups’ debut in the latest BrandZ Top 100 is that MBO has used new research to reflect the upstream brand value of oil companies for the first time. Previously, only the downstream distribution arms of energy groups such as BP and ExxonMobil were fully reflected in the brand rankings.This has had a significant effect, with BP being allocated a brand value of $17bn and entering the top 100 at 34 while ExxonMobil comes in just behind it in 39th place, with brand value of $15.5bn. It is an illustration of how brands matter not just to customers but in a business-to-business context.As ever, the year included examples of famous brands having difficulties – the most notable being Toyota, the Japanese car company. Problems with the brakes on some models led to product recalls in the US and damage to its reputation for quality.Toyota’s brand value fell from $29.9bn in the 2009 ranking to $21.7bn in the latest one, and the effect of the product recalls may not yet have fully worked its way through. Toyota joined Home Depot, another well-established brand that lost its way, falling from a brand value of $18.3bn in 2007 to $9bn this year.Many analysts expected problems for luxury clothing and goods makers, which faced a wave of discounting by retailers at the end of 2008, and fears about whether consumers would continue to be extremely high prices for a luxury image.In practice, however, well-established luxury goods brands such as Louis Vuitton have kept their value, even if they have not seen the kind of growth they might have hoped for. The value of the Louis Vuitton brand, at $19.8bn, is 2 per cent up on the previous year.So, despite the shock that many experienced following the financial crisis, brands are playing their traditional role of giving companies some cushion against market pressures. They have proved their capacity to retain loyalty among consumers even through downturns.Many brands will experience crises, or simply stagnate, in the coming year and have to claw their way back but the aftermath of the crisis has proven once again an old lesson. Brands may suffer, but they are hard to destroy altogether."

American Express last year announced it was buying Revolution Money, an online processor, for $300m.Cybersource, which helps retailers protect themselves against fraudulent online payments using its software, processes about a quarter of all US ecommerce transactions, by dollar value.The company counts British Airways, Home Depot and Facebook among its clients and last year had revenues of $265m and net income of $11m.About 8 per cent of Cybersource’s revenues came from outside the US in the fourth quarter of last year.The deal with Visa should help to spur the company’s international growth, with Asia and Latin America expected to be early priorities.The price reflects about a 34 per cent premium to where Cybersource shares closed on Tuesday.That values Cybersource at about 19 to 20 times adjusted 2011 earnings, according a source close to the deal – roughly in line with where Visa itself trades.The acquisition of Cybersource would leave few sizable businesses for rivals looking to accelerate in electronic payments. PayPal, which is owned by Ebay, is rapidly growing its activity away from the online auction site and is becoming more important to the company as its auction model falls out of favour with consumers.Cybersource, which was founded in 1994, listed on Nasdaq in 1999 as the dotcom bubble approached its apex.The company greatly expanded its presence among small businesses with the acquisition of Authorize.net in 2007 and now works with more than 295,000 merchants using both brands.Visa and Cybersource have worked together since 1999 and Cybersource’s chief executive, Michael Walsh, will stay on to oversee its operations.Shares in Visa slipped 0.61 per cent to $93.48 in afternoon trade in New York. Cybersource stock jumped almost 32 per cent to trade at $25.65 a share.JPMorgan advised Visa on the deal while Goldman Sachs acted for Cybersource.

It has been below 90 for 17 successive months. The index is calibrated from the 1986 level, which was given a value of 100.About 34 per cent of small business owners surveyed said weak sales were their biggest commercial problem.After the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,197.30, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 11,019.42 but the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent lower at 2,465.99.Alcoa, the US’s biggest aluminium producer, fell 1.6 per cent to $14.34 after it posted revenues for the first quarter that missed average expectations on Monday.It is the first company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to report its quarterly results and therefore a closely watched indicator of industrial earnings.“Alcoa’s disappointing sales result was poorly received by markets,” wrote Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank in a client note.The stock was downgraded at UBS to “neutral” from “buy”, and its target price cut to $16 from $17.Smartphone maker Palm pulled back 14.6 per cent to $5.16 on fears that the recent rally in the stock may be overdone. There were also reports that Palm had contacted China’s Huawei Technologies for preliminary acquisition talks.Regional banks were some of the biggest fallers in the S&P 500 index following a downgrade of several key stocks at UBS, which cited “additional headwinds” to the recovery in earnings. Mid-size bank stocks have been the second-fastest growing sub-sector of S&P 500 in 2010.“We continue to believe the pace of earnings recovery will fall well short of expectations,” wrote the analysts in a client note. “We think the recent rally and ensuing valuations are unsustainable, and the [sector] is poised for a meaningful pullback.”Huntington Bancshares led the sector lower, falling 5.7 per cent to $5.69 following UBS’s downgrade to “sell” from neutral. Keycorp, Regions Financial and TCF Financial were lowered to a “sell” from neutral, sending their prices down 2.4 per cent to $8.14, 4.6 per cent to $8.34 and 4 per cent to $16.31 respectively. Commerce Bancshares slipped 3 per cent to $40.80 as the stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “buy”.ConocoPhillips, the oil producer, was down 0.5 per cent to $55.67, even as China’s Sinopec said it would pay $4.65bn for ConocoPhillips’ nine per cent stake in oil-sands producer Syncrude Canada.The price is higher than many analysts had expected.Chipmaker Intel rallied 1 per cent to $22.77 ahead of its earnings announcement after the session’s close.Petrohawk Energyjumped 2.5 per cent to $23.18 as the oil and gas explorer agreed to sell half of its stake in the Haynesville midstream operations to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, a pipeline operator, for $875m.Avon Products, a direct seller of cosmetics, dived 8 per cent to $31.99 following reports that the company had suspended four executives in relation to bribery allegations at its China unit pending an internal investigation.DeVry, an operator of for-profit further eduction colleges, was one of the top performers in the S&P 500 index as the stock was raised to “outperform” from “neutral” at Credit Suisse, sending its shares 10.3 per cent higher to $71.73.Oil services stocks were hurt by the falling oil price. BJ Services fell 1.1 per cent to $21.96, Schlumberger was 1.2 per cent lower to $65.51 and Baker Hughes fell 1.3 per cent to $48.21.Do-it-yourself retailer Lowe’s was up 2.4 per cent to $26.22 as the company priced a note offering to raise $1bn in debt.Rival Home Depot was also higher, up 2.6 per cent to $34.34.
204;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

As vice-president of asset protection, my job is to protect our people, our customers and the merchandise we sell.Our stores have to be safe and secure, but they also have to be enjoyable for shoppers. We used to lock up high-ticket items but customers really found that frustrating. Sourcing better packaging and introducing security tagging has meant we no longer need to do that.A lot of my effort goes into finding security technologies that combine with our processes without spoiling our stores’ appearance or distracting staff from giving good customer service. Introducing in-store cameras that integrate with cash registers, has made it easier to spot the occasional dishonest cashier and prevent customers walking away with unpaid goods.I am also responsible for disaster recovery. During the hurricane season, I work closely with weather forecasters. We send in teams to ensure any outside products are secured, check the drains are clear of debris and protect windows. Afterwards, we do a post-strike assessment. I feel a huge obligation to ensure our stores re-open quickly.

Revised data released on Friday put annualised fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth at 5.9 per cent, the fastest expansion in more than half a decade. This looks impressive but the economy has still only returned to the size it first reached back around May 2007. No wonder it doesn’t feel like the good old days have returned.This difference between rates of change and absolute levels of activity may help explain the mixed bag of economic data of late. In the past week, for example, the Chicago purchasing managers’ index was stronger than expected, as was Friday’s GDP figure. But existing home sales for January fell 7.2 per cent month on month – the second-worst reading ever. Durable goods orders for the same period, ex-aircraft and defence, grew at only half the rate forecast and the consumer confidence index was a shocker. Jobless claims are also surprising many by ticking up again.Not only are there mixed signals within the economic data but the big picture often disconnects with stories from the ground too. For example, the expectations component of the consumer confidence survey plunged to a level consistent with real spending declines of 0.5 per cent year on year, according to High Frequency Economics. Yet retailers from Saks and Starbucks to Safeway and Home Depot report seeing signs of a rebound in discretionary spending. All are upbeat about growth.Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect statistical consistency when the future is so uncertain. Loose monetary policy is good but it has to end sometime. Stimulus spending helps but who is going to pay for it? If the data are confused, it is only because everyone else is too.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
207;HD;Home Depot;2010-02-23T23:27:20Z;Optimism dip fails to sink US retail hopes;Shoppers shift away from the bare necessities;"Some of the largest US retailers expressed growing confidence on Tuesday in the revival of discretionary spending by middle-class consumers, even as survey data showed a sharp decline in consumer confidence in February.Kathy Tesija, a senior executive at Target, the mass discounter with more than 1,700 stores, said the retailer’s customers were shifting away from a focus on necessities seen in the depths of the recession and “beginning to show signs of conscious optimism”.“Once hesitant and even fearful, they are now taking price in their new-found financial discipline, and their confidence is leading them to add a few more apparel and home items to their [shopping] basket,” she said.Karen Hoguet, chief financial officer of Macy’s, which runs 850 department stores, said the retailer was feeling “cautiously optimistic” about 2010, after a fourth quarter that saw improved spending on clothing and home goods.“We are seeing more balance in the business, with customers ready to buy brands that are better,” as long as they are appropriately priced, she said.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, reported improvements in its fourth quarter sales of expensive items such as kitchen cabinets, mirroring results on Monday at rival Lowe’s. Like Lowe’s, it forecast a return to same store sales growth in the year ahead, after almost four years of declines.The comments reinforced the picture of the US consumer that has emerged from other retailers and consumer goods companies in recent weeks of a split between those with jobs and the estimated 16.5 per cent of the workforce that is unemployed or obliged to work part time.Macy’s said its 40 upmarket Bloomingdale’s department stores had a “terrific” fourth quarter, following a 6.9 per cent increase in comparable store sales reported by its rival Nordstrom late on Monday. At Home Depot, transactions above $900, which account for about 20 per cent of sales at its US stores, declined less than
1 per cent during the quarter, against the double digit declines seen in the first three quarters of the year.Retailers reporting on Tuesday stressed their continuing concerns over unemployment and tight credit, concerns underlined by consumer confidence figures for February from the Conference Board, whose index fell to its lowest level in 10 months on short -term job worries.Terry Lundgren, chief executive of Macy’s, said the stores would continue to take a conservative approach to clothing inventory, while possibly taking a more aggressive approach in areas such as cosmetics.Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer of Target, said the pessimistic consumer confidence reading reflected his view that there would be sometimes contradictory signs on the state of the broad consumer economy.”I think we’re going to be in the kind of environment where there’s going to be a lot of mixed signals,” he said."
208;HD;Home Depot;2010-02-23T22:10:43Z;Strong earnings fail to lift Wall Street;;Weak US macro data dragged Wall Street stocks lower Tuesday, in spite of positive earnings surprises from a number of big retailing groups.The consumer confidence index dropped sharply to 46.0 in February versus 56.5 in January, the lowest level since April and significantly more than average economist estimates.“The drop in confidence may take the wind out of the sails of consumer spending briefly, but we do not see it as a major game-changer in terms of the progress of the recovery,” said Brian Bethune, chief US financial economist at IHS Global Insight. “Consumer spending is not expected to energise the recovery in 2010, but rather plod along at relatively subdued rates. [Tuesday’s] report simply reinforces that view.”The S&P/Case-Shiller home price index showed that US house prices fell 0.2 per cent in December, but the annual rate of decline slowed down. House prices fell 3.1 per cent last year.At the close, the S&P 500 was 1.2 per cent lower at 1,094.60 – down to its 100-day moving average, a closely watched technical level.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 10,282.41 and the Nasdaq was 1.3 per cent lower at 2,213.44.It was one of the busiest days of the reporting season for retail companies.Pulling the Dow Jones higher was Home Depot, a leading home-improvement chain, that closed 1.4 per cent up to $30.75 following the release of fourth-quarter earnings. It recorded a profit, versus a loss a year ago, and comfortably beat expectations.Shares in Macy’s, the department store chain, gained 1.1 per cent to $18.67 after its fourth-quarter results. Cost control and a favourable tax settlement contributed. The company said it expected sales to rise by 2 per cent at established stores this year.Target was down 1.2 per cent to $50.06 in spite of the value retailer reporting solid quarterly results. It saw a 54 per cent rise on last year’s quarterly profits.Customers bought more food, health and beauty goods as they cut back on discretionary purchases, Target said.Sears, the department store chain that owns Kmart, declined 1.9 per cent to $93.80 in spite of quarterly result showing that profitability improved, sales declines slowed and fourth quarter sales exceeded estimates.RadioShackwas one of the session’s biggest fallers, losing 7.4 per cent to $19.11, as the operator of one of the biggest retail networks in the US posted results on Monday after the market’s close that failed to impress investors. The stock, however, was upgraded by S&P Equity analysts to “hold” from “sell”.In the clothing sector, Liz Claiborne, a fashion clothing company that owns the Juicy Couture, Lucky Brand and Kate Spade brands declined 0.5 per cent to $6.37 as its latest quarterly figures disappointed investors and it forecast a sharper than expected loss in the current quarter. US sales fell 3 per cent, while international sales were 22 per cent lower than the previous year.Office Depot, the office supplies retailer, gained 3.5 per cent to $6.88 as its latest quarterly results were not as bad as some analysts had expected.The company said that sales trends were improving in the current quarter and it expected to post an annual profit this year, albeit a smaller one than a year ago.Brocade Communications, a maker of networking equipment, dived 23 per cent to $5.36 as its quarterly results missed analysts’ average estimates and its forecasts for the full year disappointed. The stock was downgraded by Goldman Sachs.Smartphone maker Palm Inc declined 10 per cent to $8.20, touching an 11-month low, after Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock on concerns that its products are struggling to compete with Google’s iPhones and Research in Motion Ltd’s BlackBerry phones, and that the window of opportunity may be closing.The energy sector posted sharp declines as investors pulled back following a fall in crude oil prices.Chevron fell 1.3 per cent to $72.04 while ExxonMobil lost 0.7 per cent to $64.94.
209;HD;Home Depot;2010-02-23T21:48:39Z;Poor data reverse earlier rally in stocks;UK gilt and US Treasury yields fall as traders move to avoid risk;"21:30 GMT. A sudden relapse for the euro following a report showing poor German industrial sentiment; downbeat comments from Bank of England governor Mervyn King; and a worryingly weak survey of US consumer confidence combined to curtail traders’ appetite for riskier assets on Tuesday.The FTSE World index fell 1 per cent and oil tumbled 1.6 per cent as investors fretted that the economic recovery in the US and Europe was looking increasingly fragile.The S&P 500 on Wall Street lost 1.2 per cent in spite of receiving some support from a benign Case-Shiller housing report and well-received earnings from Home Depot. But consumer confidence dropped dramatically, as the index reported at a far lower level than expected. The surprising result tested traders’ hopes that a sturdy recovery was beginning to get underway.“It should come as no surprise that consumers are a bit dour despite the economy having come out of the recession,” said Thomas Simons, money market economist at Jefferies. “The labour market is the main driver of consumer sentiment and until there is material improvement in the labour market in the form of actual payroll gains, there is little chance that consumers will feel more comfortable.”Since rising to its 50-day moving average at the end of last week, the S&P index has retreated. Such a move raises the spectre that what seemed like a resumption of the climb begun last March was only a hiccup on the way to a longer corrective phase.“The second leg of downtrend could be resuming,” said MacNeil Curry, chief North American technical analyst at Barclays Capital. “Most of the rallies have been on declining volume. That’s not what you’d expect to see in a sustainable advance. The correction will continue, though it may be more of a grind rather than a rapid descent, since many people are standing aside.”● European bourses had earlier got off to a reasonable start on hopes that Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, would tell Congress on Wednesday that interest rates would remain low “for an extended period”, and that his decision last week to raise the discount rate charged to banks was merely a technical move.Indeed, the brief wobble caused by the unexpected timing of the discount rate rise seemed to have been forgotten, and bourses looked to challenge their February highs.But the cocktail of bad news put paid to that. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 lost 1.1 per cent and the FTSE 100 in London fell 0.7 per cent, with miners under pressure as commodity prices subsided.● The euro reversed early gains as traders absorbed the disappointing IFO survey on German business sentiment. After nearly breaching $1.37 it was later down 0.6 per cent to $1.3512.The US dollar was down during Asian trading thanks to strength in the commodities-tied Australian and Canadian dollars, a bullish indicator. But it rose 0.5 per cent on a trade weighted basis after the US data was released, playing its usual role as a safe place for risk-averse investors - which for some has raised fears of a dollar carry trade that could unwind.”We had the dollar trade on the backfoot until the data came. Now we’ve clearly seen a sharp reversals in riskier currencies. The data was bad enough to trigger a degree of unwinding,” said Jens Nordvig of Nomura Securities.“These data points are not good ones. We need to see domestic demand improving in the United States, especially right now, because the stimulus will start to fade very soon.”● The IFO survey raised fears about the health of European corporates, pushing benchmark credit default swap indices slightly higher. The Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 investment grade companies rose 1.3 basis point to 84.8bp and the Markit iTraxx Crossover index of mainly junk-rated European companies rose 9bp to 464bp.● The FTSE Asia-Pacific index had earlier climbed 0.3 per cent, with few drivers cited by traders beyond a partial resumption of the recent rally. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong advanced 1.2 per cent, and the Sensex in India rose 0.3 per cent, but Shanghai fell 0.7 per cent and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo was off 0.5 per cent.● Gold danced to the dollar’s tune, falling back as the buck rallied. The precious metal was later down 1 per cent to $1,103 Oil was particularly badly hit as profit-taking bit into crude’s recent sharp advance. Oil lost 1.6 per cent to $79.05, having earlier dropped to $78.22. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a commodities basket, fell 1.6 per cent, led by declines in softs like sugar and cocoa .● So-called haven government bonds reversed early declines as investors switched from falling stocks into debt. The yield on the US 10-year benchmark fell 11 basis point to 3.68 per cent, the largest drop in two weeks. An auction of $44bn of 2-year Treasury notes priced at a yield of 0.895%, slightly higher than the yield at last month’s auction.The yield on Greek 10-year bonds rose 7 basis points to 6.48 per cent as traders waited to see if a much-rumoured bond issue would soon come to pass."
210;HD;Home Depot;2010-02-23T13:36:55Z;Home Depot swings to profit on DIY demand;;Home Depot, the world’s biggest home improvement retailer, swung to a profit in the fourth quarter from a year-ago loss, as customers turned increasingly to “do it yourself” renovation projects as they gained confidence in the value of their homes.The company, whose results beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts, announced its first dividend increase in three years and raised its outlook for 2010.Net income at Home Depot was $342m, or 20 cents a share, during the final three months of the year. That was a marked improvement from the same quarter a year earlier when the company reported a loss of $54m, or 3 cents.The Atlanta-based company has worked hard to slash costs during the last year and turned a profit in spite of slipping sales, which fell by 0.3 per cent to $14.6bn. However, its closely watched comparable store sales rose by 1.2 per cent, fuelled by international demand. Same-store sales in the US were off by 1.1 per cent.”In the face of a very tough selling environment, our associates did an amazing job in 2009,” Frank Blake, Home Depot’s chief executive, said in a statement.Home Depot said that its quarterly sales were fuelled by purchases of paint, flooring, plumbing and kitchen and bath materials.Home Depot’s results followed a strong performance from smaller rival Lowe’s on Monday. Lowe’s, which said it expected to see its first rise in comparable store sales since 2006 this year, reported net earnings of $205m, a 26.5 per cent increase against the same period last year, with diluted earnings per share of 14 cents. Sales for the quarter increased 1.8 per cent to $10.2bn, up from $10bn in the fourth quarter of 2008.“We think what you are seeing in the numbers from Home Depot and Lowe’s is spend by those people in their homes feeling more confident from when median home values troughed in January 2009,” said Brian Sozzi, an analyst at Wall Street Securities.Shares of Home Depot rose over 1 per cent to $30.60 in morning trading on Tuesday.In other retail earnings news:Sears, the third largest US retailer, said its profits more than doubled in the fourth quarter to $430m. However, that was largely due to sharp cost-cutting, as sales fell by 0.2 per cent to $13.2bn. Comparable store sales in the US were off by 2.5 per cent.Sears shares were up by 4.59 per cent to $100.05 in pre-market trading on Tuesday.Target, the mass discounter, also reported a stronger than expeceted fourth quarter, with net earnings up 53 per cent at $936m, or 81 cents per diluted share, on a 3.7 per cent increase in sales to $19.7bn. The retailer reported improved profit margins as it saw a significant 20 per cent drop in the value of post-holiday clearance sales of excess inventory.Gregg Steinhafel, CEO said the retailer expected continued improvements in customer traffic and discetionary spending along with “a continued modest recovery in the economy.”Target’s shares were 1.6 per cent down in morning trading, at $49.48.Macy’s, the traditional department store, said underlined the renewed readiness to spend among more prosperous customers, saying a rebound at its upmarket Bloomingdale’s chain and a 26.2 per cent increase in online sales contributed to fourth quarter earnings that exceeded its most recent forecast.Macy’s said it was expecting its comparable store sales to increase by between 1 and 2 per cent in the current fiscal year. It reported a fourth quarter net income in the fourth quarter of $466m, or $1.10 a share, including $186m of charges linked to restructuring and store closures. Comparable sales in the fourth quarter rose 0.6 per cent, while total sales lost 1.1 per cent to $7.85bn.Macy’s shares were down 0.4 per cent at $18.41 in morning trade.
211;HD;Home Depot;2010-02-22T20:21:41Z;Do-it-yourself projects boost Lowe’s;;Lowe’s, the US home improvement retailer, is expecting its comparable store sales to grow this year for the first time in more than three years, as consumers show a renewed readiness to spend on “weekend” do-it-yourself projects.Robert Niblock, chief executive officer, on Monday cited stronger demand for new bathroom sink cabinets, energy efficient toilets and other big ticket items during the retailer’s fourth quarter as “an encouraging sign that consumers are gaining the confidence to take on more discretionary projects”.“While uncertainty remains, there are many indications that the worst of the economic cycle is likely behind us . . . On a relative basis the economic outlook is much better than a year ago,” he said.Lowe’s reported a 1.6 per cent fall in same-store sales for the fourth quarter against the same period last year, when sales fell 9.9 per cent. But its stores in 26 of the 50 US states reported positive same-store sales growth during the quarter.It expects comparable sales growth of 1 to 3 per cent for its new fiscal year, reversing its quarterly declines and those of its larger rival Home Depot since the summer of 2006.Lowe’s, which has almost 1,700 US stores, said it expected the stronger spending to remain focused initially on “weekend projects” rather than significant home renovations.But the spending on more big items reflected a shift away from customer behaviour during the recession, when spending at both Lowe’s and Home Depot was focused on basic repair and maintenance items, such as plumbing pipe, paint and roofing materials.During the fourth quarter Lowe’s saw positive growth in sales of flooring and of cabinets and cabinet tops, a category that had seen sales fall for more than three years. It also saw positive sales growth in its installation and its customised kitchen design business.Mr Niblock cautioned that consumers were still under pressure from falling home prices and high unemployment as well as constraints on credit. Sales to professional contractors also remained subdued during the fourth quarter, which Mr Niblock suggested reflected the shift to DIY during the recession.Lowe’s is the latest retailer with middle-class customers to report evidence of renewed discretionary spending during the fourth quarter of 2009, with othersincluding JC Penney, the mid-range department store, and Estée Lauder, the cosmetics group.Lowe’s reported net earnings of $205m, a 26.5 per cent increase against the same period last year, with diluted earnings per share of $0.14.

Sales fell by 4.4 per cent to $10.1bn.“We saw some encouraging signs of progress in the third quarter,” Bruce Johnson, Sears’ interim chief executive, said in a statement. “As we approach this important selling season, we are focused on executing our holiday strategy.”US retailers have expressed some optimism ahead of the holiday shopping season as sales have started to stabilise. On Wednesday Home Depot and Saks both said they saw positive signs from consumers in the latest quarter, and last month retail sales in the US rose by 1.4 per cent.Much of the third-quarter profit at Sears was in its Kmart division, where comparable store sales – the metric favoured by retailers – rose by 0.5 per cent. It was the first rise in same-store sales at Kmart in four years and the business benefited from greater demand for toys, home products and shoes.Over all, however, same-store sales at Sears were off by 2.3 per cent in the US. The Illinois-based company said sales were slower for appliances, lawn and garden products, tools and electronics.Mr Johnson said that Sears made progress shoring up its balance sheet by cutting administrative costs by $101m and that it improved its gross profit margin rate by managing inventories more efficiently. Sears had lower markdowns on summer clothing and home merchandise during the quarter.Sears shuttered seven underperforming stores in the latest quarter and said it expected to take a $5m charge in the upcoming quarter related to stores it closed earlier this year. The company operates 3,914 stores in the US and Canada.Shares of Sears rose 3.77 per cent to $78.63 in pre-market trading on Thursday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 10,437.42 and the Nasdaq also edged 0.3 per cent higher to 2,203.78.Soaring oil prices lifted US stocks on Monday to close at their highest level since October last year.But the consumer discretionary sector weighed on the market on Tuesday after retailers remained cautious about the upcoming holiday season.Home Depot, the largest home improvement chain in the US, reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year outlook on Tuesday after fighting to cut costs in the face of weaker demand. The shares fell 2.4 per cent to $26.99 after the retailer warned the housing market was still under pressure. The sector has been badly hit in the recession because homeowners have spent less on their existing properties and the frozen housing market has reduced the need for renovation projects.On Monday, Lowe’s, the second-largest player in the sector, had posted a 30 per cent decline in profits and said it did not expect a market recovery to start until the middle of next year.“The numbers were pretty decent but the problem for the market is that there are a lot of high expectations,” said Brett Hawkins, portfolio manager at Thompson, Siegel & Walmsley.“The underlying problem is that total credit is still contracting and we’re recovering off a really low base. To get people to really drive the market higher from here there has to
be some evidence that
we’re really reflating as an economy.”Target, the second-largest discount retailer in the US, also reported third-quarter results that beat analysts’ expectations. However, the shares fell 3 per cent to $48.77 after the group said it remained cautious about the upcoming few months.At the other end of the consumer market, Saks, the upmarket department store chain, swung to a net profit after analysts had been expecting continuing losses.While cost-cutting was the main reason for the reversal in the retailer’s fortunes, the company said it had also seen customers starting to spend more in the jewellery and women’s designer sportswear departments. Its shares were up 4.1 per cent to $6.67.Dillard’s, the department store chain based in Texas and Florida, also returned to the black in the third quarter thanks to a tax benefit and cost cutting. Analysts had forecast worse results and the shares rose 8.9 per cent at $14.51.Jacobs Engineering the country’s second-largest publicly traded engineering company, reported a bigger drop in quarterly profit than expected.The group said it had suffered from the cancellation of one big oil and gas project. Its shares fell 14.5 per cent to $38.88.Jacobs’ results added to the pessimism in the sector after data showed industrial production in October was lower than expected.Smith International, the oilfield contractor, lost 12.7 per cent to $26.89 after offering 28m shares in an effort to pay back debt and fund acquisitions. The company has suffered from a sharp decline in the US natural gas market, prompting it to cut almost one fifth of its workforce. Profits during the third quarter fell
97 per cent, the group said last month.Playboy shareholders suffered some of the biggest losses. Shares in the magazine publisher slid 14.2 per cent to $4.10 after Linda Havard, the company’s chief financial officer, resigned late on Monday.Applied Materials, the world’s biggest tool provider for the semiconductor industry, agreed to buy Semitool for $364m in cash.It said the acquisition would allow it to produce smaller and more powerful chips for use in smartphones and notebook computers. Semitool shares rose 31.2 per cent to $11.02 but Applied Materials slipped 0.9 per cent to $12.94.Shares in Palm, which produces smartphones, rose 5.8 per cent to $12.54 after Kaufman Bros upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold”."
217;HD;Home Depot;2009-11-17T18:02:48Z;US retailers see signs of stabilisation;;"Three of the largest US retailers saw signs of improvement on Tuesday over the outlook for consumer spending amid signs of a stabilising housing market.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, said sales in 36 of its top 40 markets showed sequential improvements at the end of its third quarter but cautioned that sales were in “less bad” rather than positive territory.The second-largest US retailer by sales also said it was continuing to see
signs of stabilisation in sales in California, Florida and Arizona, the states worst hit by the housing slump.Frank Blake, chief executive, also welcomed the fact that the percentage of US GDP devoted to private fixed residential investment (PFRI) also remained flat, rather than falling during the third quarter – data the company have used as an indicator of overall health of its customers.“It is positive news that the PFRI data seems to have bottomed,” he said, while cautioning that demand from the company’s professional trade customers, who handle major projects, was continuing to underperform more casual do-it-yourself sales.The retailer reported that third-quarter earnings per share fell 8.9 per cent to $689m, or 41 cents per share, beating Wall Street’s consensus forecast of
36 cents. Revenues fell 8 per cent to $16.36bn, while comparable US store sales were down 7.1 per cent.The retailer raised its full- year earnings per share guidance to $1.55, a 13 per cent decline on the previous year. It had previously expected a drop of 15-20 per cent in full-year earnings.Lowe’s, Home Depot’s smaller rival, said on Monday that it had begun to see improvements in the housing market in some of the hardest hit regions such as California and Florida.The home improvement retailers’ cautious view of the US consumer was also reflected on Tuesday by Saks, the luxury retailer, and Target, the discounter.Saks has seen its sales drop 20 per cent since the economic crisis was sparked in September last year, but Steven Sadove, its chief executive, said on Tuesday he believed “there is more stability and predictability in our business compared to 12 or even six months ago”, while cautioning that “the overall environment remains challenging”.The retailer said that towards the end of its third quarter it had seen “relative strength” in areas such as women’s designer sportswear, outerwear, jewellery and some accessories.Saks also said it expected to see further modest falls in sales during the spring
of 2010, and remained focused on controlling its expenses.Target, which focuses on middle to low-income customers, said it had seen profits “well above” expectations during its third quarter. But it said it remained “cautious about fourth-quarter performance and is planning conservatively in both business segments”.Saks posted net profit of $1.9m or one cent per share, compared to a $43m loss in the same quarter last year. Its sales fell 8.5 per cent to $631.4m.Target reported an 18 per cent increase in net profit to $436m, or 58 cents per diluted share on a 1.4 per cent increase in retail sales to $14.8bn.Additional reporting by Alan Rappeport in New York"
218;HD;Home Depot;2009-11-17T17:38:33Z;Downturn deals blow to US immigrants;;The men are huddled together as if for warmth, their faces framed by thick hoodies pulled tight under their chins. Most will wait for work all day in this frosty Home Depot car park in north-east Washington before returning empty-handed to their apartments, shelters or bridges.It was not always this way. Francisco, a 30-year-old Guatemalan, grins at the memory of America’s bubble years when plentiful jobs drew millions of migrants like him into the country. “You could work seven days a week, even 24 hours if you wanted,” he says.Now, the 100 or so labourers who gather here each day are lucky to get two days of work a week. Most customers going in and out of the home improvement store ignore the group, which stretches along the car park and out on to the road.The effects of the US recession seem all too visible in a month in which the unemployment rate punched through 10 per cent, but these men are some of its hidden victims.Many lived in the shadows even before the downturn, clinging to the bottom rung of the labour force in low-wage construction and service sector jobs. Yet on the eve of the downturn, immigrants represented one-sixth of workers in the US and half of all new workers, according to the Migration Policy Institute.Blue-collar immigrants were among the first to lose their grip when the economy contracted and – for the estimated 30 per cent who are here illegally – there was no government safety net to break their fall.The labour department does not publish regular data on immigrants in the workforce, but preliminary analysis of its raw numbers by the Pew Research Centre for the Financial Times suggests they have been hit disproportionately hard. In the third quarter of 2007, the unemployment rate for immigrants was 4.1 per cent, lower than that of Americans. By the third quarter of this year, Americans’ unemployment rate had risen to 9.5 per cent and the rate for immigrants had leapt ahead to 10 per cent. Among the almost 50 per cent of immigrants that are Hispanic, the rate hit 11.5 per cent.While no one can separate out the impact on undocumented immigrants, it is safe to assume they have fared at least as badly as their legal counterparts. Pew estimates that undocumented workers held some 17 per cent of construction jobs, for example, a sector which has slashed its payrolls by a fifth since the recession began.Without access to unemployment insurance, many undocumented immigrants have turned to churches for food and clothes while scrabbling for odd jobs.“Foreign-born workers . . . have more underlying incentive to be active, to do whatever work you can do, because you don’t have access to safety nets,” says Rakesh Kochhar, associate research director at Pew.In the Home Depot car park, the arrival of a potential employer can often trigger a free-for-all. “Everybody jumps in the truck,” says Alex, a 37-year-old who came to the US more than a decade ago. “They’re desperate, some haven’t even got money for lunch.”It is a physical display of what is happening across the US labour market. The supply of willing workers has overwhelmed demand and, as a result, wage growth is falling fast. Day labourers here used to earn about $10 an hour. Now contractors take one look at the waiting hoards and offer $7 or $8 instead.Rising unemployment and falling wages affect not just the immigrants themselves, but also their home countries. The Inter-American Development Bank predicts remittances from the US to Latin America will drop 11 per cent this year. The men at Home Depot roar with laughter as they claim that their wives back home are divorcing them, convinced their husbands are no longer sending money back because they have found new girlfriends to spoil.Only a quarter of Hispanic immigrants who have lost their jobs manage to keep sending remittances, according to an IDB survey, by eating into their savings and cutting costs. There is even some anecdotal evidence of so-called “reverse remittances” as families in Mexico wire money to relatives north of the border.One way to survive is to move to cheaper accommodation or move in with friends or family. Alex says he pays $500 a month for his apartment in Washington. He plans to move to Florida, where he hears a single room with a bathroom costs $300 a month.Internal migration patterns among immigrants are shifting. Census data show that the once rapid flow of Hispanics to “bubble towns” such as Las Vegas, Phoenix and parts of the Midwest has slowed. Instead, old immigrant heartlands such as California have seen an increase in Hispanics as people return to social networks that can sustain them.“They need to be involved with a community where they can communicate and be able to find other forms of work,” says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution.Many economists had assumed that economic migrants were a sort of safety valve for the labour market: they would flood into the country when work was plentiful, and leave when demand dried up. But that has not happened. Flows of new immigrants have slowed dramatically, but there is little evidence of significant numbers returning home.In part, that is because many immigrants’ home economies are in dire straits too. Tightening US border security also deters some from leaving, for fear it would be too hard to get back in again. Others have put down roots here.One man in the Home Depot crowd says he is staying for the most practical of reasons: “I can’t afford a flight home.”
219;HD;Home Depot;2009-11-03T01:03:17Z;Stanley seals $4.5bn Black & Decker tie-up;;Stanley Works has agreed to purchase of Black & Decker for $4.5bn in an all-stock tie-up uniting two American household brands.Stanley, whose hand tools have been a ubiquitous presence in US hardware stores for more than a century, will pay a 22 per cent premium, based on Friday’s close, to purchase Black & Decker’s equally well known line of drills, screwdrivers and other power tools.The companies said on Monday they planned to wring out about $350m in annual costs through the transaction, which they expect will add about $1 in per-share earnings within three years. “The driving motivation of the transaction is the present value of the $350m in annual cost synergies,” Nolan Archibald, Black & Decker’s chief executive, said on Monday in a statement.The combination might also help both businesses extract better terms from both retailers and suppliers just as an improving housing market rekindles demand for tools.“Mass merchant retailers – Walmart, Home Depot, Lowe’s – and raw material suppliers beware,” Brian Sozzi, an analyst with Wall Street Strategies, said. “The combined purchasing power of Stanley Black & Decker is coming online in 2010.”Under the terms of the all-stock deal, investors will receive 1.275 Stanley shares for each share of Black & Decker they own. Following the merger’s completion, expected in the first half of 2010, Stanley shareholders will own 50.5 per cent of the combined company.John Lundgren, Stanley’s chairman and chief executive, will be chief executive of the combined company, to be named Stanley Black & Decker. Mr Archibald will be chairman for three years. Black & Decker shares jumped 21 per cent in late trading on Monday after the agreement’s announcement, while Stanley rose 4 per cent.Moody’s Investors Service placed Stanley’s “A3” senior unsecured debt rating under review. “The review will focus on the company’s ability to integrate Black & Decker’s diverse businesses with its own while not adversely disrupting key customer, supplier and employee relationships, and realise cost and operating synergies,” Moody’s said in a statement.Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs advised Stanley’s financial advisers on the deal, while Cravath Swaine & Moore served as legal counsel.Black & Decker’s advisers were JPMorgan Chase, Hogan & Hartson and Miles & Stockbridge.
220;HD;Home Depot;2009-10-30T20:54:10Z;Wall St falls sharply on mixed data;;US stocks dropped sharply on Friday as the markets fell for a second successive week on mixed economic numbers that dented optimism.The Nasdaq Composite index of mostly technology stocks saw its first fall on the month since February after Weak consumer spending numbers suggested the recovery may be slow and protracted.Analysts insisted, however, that the rally can continue into the new year, with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing an eighth consecutive month of gains.The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.5 per cent to 2,045.11 and was down 5 per cent on the week.The S&P 500 index dropped 2.81 per cent to 1,036.19 and was down 4.14 per cent on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average of blue-chip stocks fell 2.51 per cent to 9,712.73 and was 2.6 per cent lower on the week.Some of the biggest falls were among the financials, such as Bank of America and Citigroup. Bank of America fell 7.18 per cent to $14.6 and Citigroup dropped 5.34 per cent to $4.08.Chevron, the second-largest US energy group, was another casualty as its shares fell 2.03 per cent to $76.37, in spite of third-quarter profits beat expectations, .Financials and energy stocks have seen some of the largest gains since the rally began in March. Analysts suggested investors may be taking profits in these stocks amid some concern over the strength of the recovery.Other big losers included McAfee, which saw its shares fall 4.66 per cent to $41.71. The stock has been hit by earnings on Thursday that showed the security software maker had missed revenue estimates as sales grew at their slowest rate in nearly two years.Novatel Wireless also tumbled, 4.4 per cent to $8.92, after it warned sales of its mobile wi-fi product would be flat to lower.Stocks of American Express, Home Depot, DuPont and MetLife showed declines. American Express fell 4.5 per cent to $34.80, Home Depot fell 3.2 per cent to $25.08, DuPont dropped 3.55 per cent to $31.81 and MetLife was 8.44 per cent lower to $33.73.Bucking the trend, shares of Genworth Financial were up 3.93 per cent to $10.58. The insurer reported a net operating profit on Thursday that beat expectations.Among the sectors, materials was hit hard as well as financials and energy. Financial stocks fell 4.76 per cent, energy shares were down 3.82 per cent, while materials were 3.82 per cent lower.It was the US consumer spending numbers, which fell for the first time in five months that took the steam out of many stocks.Data suggested that job losses may keep household spending muted even as the economy resumes growth.Even though business activity in the US unexpectedly expanded in October, investors focused on the gloomier data.Chicago’s Institute for Supply Management said its business barometer had increased to 54.2, higher than expected. A reading lower than 50 signals a contraction.The weakness was in spite of strong economic growth numbers on Thursday, which showed that the economy grew at an annualised 3.5 per cent in the third quarter, taking the US out of recession.Some analysts said on Friday’s losses were partly due to a correction from Thursday, which saw the biggest one-day rally since July 23.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said: “We have seen eight months of gains and I think that can continue. The market was up on Thursday, so this is a bit of a correction.”Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, added: “It has been another week of good corporate numbers but the market had priced in good company results at the start of the month and has struggled to push higher.”

Women Want More
How to capture your share of the world’s largest, fastest-growing market

Why She Buys
The new strategy for reaching the world’s most powerful consumers
Bridget Brennan
Crown Publishing, $26Any recovery is likely to be consumer-led, so retailers in particular are becoming the focus for signs of new trends in what the customer wants.As Women Want More points out, the majority of consumer spending in the US is controlled by women, and the authors of this new book predict that the purchasing power of women around the world will continue to grow. They also suggest that the expansion of women’s spending will help lead the way out of the current slump.This book and another recently published title, Why She Buys, go some way to guiding retailers and consumer goods manufacturers on how these increasingly powerful customers think and shop.In Why She Buys, Bridget Brennan begins with a traumatic afternoon at a car showroom. The author and her husband are contemplating buying a BMW 540i model. They are impressed by the smooth test drive and the teutonic engineering. But then Brennan notices the inadequate cupholders.The salesman’s dismissive response that Europeans don’t drink coffee in the car fails to save the deal from Brennan’s veto – proof, she argues, that manufacturers and retailers must ask themselves if they are addressing women’s demands, even in the manly world of the car showroom.Brennan, head of Female Factor, a consultancy, delivers an often entertaining and bullet-point rich account of some of what she sees as the ocean of untapped opportunities. She includes some instructive success stories, including a Lexus car dealership in Chicago that offers customers free car washes, and hints on selling to women face to face (make eye contact, let her speak).Fun and anecdotal, Why She Buys would probably encourage some self-examination at the average local home improvement store or bank.Women Want More, meanwhile, is the latest title from Michael Silverstein, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group, whose Trading Up and Treasure Hunt investigated dominant pre-recession consumer trends.According to Silverstein and his BCG co-author Kate Sayre, women control 72 per cent of purchasing and consumption spending in the US, and about $20,000bn of consumer spending globally. Their global earnings are expected to increase from about $12,000bn to as much as $18,000bn by 2013, and the earnings gap with men is expected to narrow further as the number of women being educated grows at a faster rate than men.Many retailers and consumer goods companies already theoretically acknowledge that women are in charge of shopping and households: executives at Wal-Mart, Tesco and Procter & Gamble talk about customers as “she”, rather than “he”. But the top management ranks of the consumer industry remain predominantly male, even amid signs that some companies have worked out where the money is.Ikea, the Swedish home furnishing retailer, provides a child-minding room. Best Buy, seller of electronics toys for boys, has been promoting more female staff and trying to make stores more appealing to women.Silverstein and Sayre, as befits BCG consultants, offer an ambitious and systematic view of the opportunities, based on a study of 12,000 women in 21 countries from the US and Sweden to Saudi Arabia via China, Mexico and India. They construct six sometimes overlapping archetypal female consumers, from “Fast tracker” to “Making ends meet”, illustrating each with case studies. The research also asked the open question of what a “dream day” would comprise, delivering some insight into the universe of unmet wants.Some strong themes and interesting statistics emerge. “Demands on time” are the top challenge for 47 per cent of respondents; 72 per cent say their mother is the dominant person in their lives; 42 per cent are made extremely happy by pets but only 27 per cent by sex.Overall, the book argues that consumer companies, still predominantly run by men, need to listen to female customers, and that politicians might be well served by listening too.Home Depot, the US home improvement retailer, seems to agree – or perhaps it has taken on board some of the tips offered by Brennan. As it strives to increase sales in a moribund market, the über-male DIY store has launched a range of home products by Martha Stewart."
222;HD;Home Depot;2009-09-22T21:50:06Z;Lowe’s warns of reductions in assets value;;Lowe’s, the US home improvement chain, warned on Tuesday that it could face up to $100m in charges arising from from reductions in the asset value of underperforming stores, as it continues to face a “challenging” economic environment.In a presentation to Wall Street analysts, Robert Niblock, chief executive, said he remained “conservative” about the prospects for Lowe’s sales, given the continued uncertainty over consumer sentiment and the wider economy.He noted that in spite of the falls in house prices, customers continued to regard their home as their largest asset, but were increasingly opting to carry out improvement projects themselves to save money.“Consumers are shifting to more do-it-yourself projects as they balance convenience with the cost of outsourcing,” he said.Brian Sozzi, analyst at Wall Street Strategies, noted that providing fully installed projects such as kitchen refits had accounted for 6 per cent of the retailer’s sales in 2008.“With consumers cutting out the tradesman to tackle small home upgrades themselves, Lowe’s has been negatively impacted,” he said in a note to clients.Lowe’s has in the past been prematurely optimistic in predicting a betterment in the home improvement market. But in August, it trimmed its store opening plans for next year to between 35 and 45, from 62 to 66, after reporting lower-than-expected second- quarter sales. In 2008, it opened 115 new stores.On Tuesday, the retailer announced the closure of one store, but said it also planned to review “the future viability” of a handful of stores once the US housing market stabilised, which could lead to the possible impairment charges.Excluding the possible impairment charges, the company maintained its earnings guidance for the year of $1.13 to $1.21, on total sales of about $47bn. It said it expected the home improvement market to grow by about 1 per cent in 2010, with same-store sales decreasing by about 1 per cent, and overall sales up by 3 to 4 per cent.Lowe’s announced its first venture outside North America in August, with a joint-venture with Woolworth’s in Australia to develop up to 150 home improvement stores in the next five years. It is also opening its first stores in Mexico, where its larger rival, Home Depot, is already established.US home prices rose 0.3 per cent in July from the previous month, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, while its house price index fell 4.2 per cent for the 12 months ended in July, the smallest decline this year.Lennar, the US home builder, said on Monday it had increased its number of housing construction start-ups in its most recent quarter, as demand improved.

Home Retail, the parent company of Argos and Homebase, fell 6.7 per cent to 307½p, even though second-quarter sales came in above expectations. “In our view the market has for some time been discounting upgrades on this statement,” commented Cazenove.Kesa Electricals, which also posted a better-than-expected trading update, fell 5.3 per cent to 143½p, also on profit taking. Traders were unsurprised by the declines, given the 56 per cent gain for the FTSE General Retail index over the past six months. Other retail stocks that closed lower included computer games specialist Game Group, down 7.1 per cent to 174p, and Kingfisher, which fell 4 per cent to 207.3p even though US rival Home Depot said it saw opportunities for overseas acquisitions.The FTSE 100 fell 16.6 points, or 0.l3 per cent, to 4,987.7. The FTSE 250 slid 11.3 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 9,125.7.Tour operator Thomas Cook was one of the most actively traded stocks as RBS, Commerzbank and UBS placed 376m shares – a 44 per cent stake – on behalf of the creditors of German retailer Arcandor at 240p each. Relief that the overhang had been cleared saw Thomas Cook close 4.6 per cent higher at 256.3p.Smith & Nephew added 1.5 per cent to 559½p as rumours swirled the market that another bid for a FTSE 100 company was in the pipeline. Traders said Scottish & Southern Energy, unchanged at £11.34 and Tullow Oil, off 0.9 per cent to £11.01, were other possible targets.3i, the quoted private equity group, lost 2.6 per cent to 302.7p after Oriel Securities downgraded, citing valuation. “The price has almost trebled from a low of 109p in March to 309p currently,” said analyst Iain Scouller.“We think there is a danger that the market may be getting too optimistic at the prospects of a sharp recovery in returns from the investment portfolio.”British Airways added a further 2.2 per cent to 215.7p on further deal rumours. This time the talk was of a merger with BMI.Among the mid caps, Sports Direct International provided the main talking point. Shares in the UK’s biggest sports retailer by sales dropped 16.3 per cent to 108.9p on news that the Serious Fraud Office and the Office of Fair Trading were investigating allegations of anti-competitive practices.In response Citigroup cut its rating on Sports Direct to “neutral”, citing the related increased risk profile of the company’s earnings. Rival JJB Sports shed 10.3 per cent to finish at 34¾p.Yell Group was finally hit by profit taking. It closed 7.4 per cent cheaper at 72.4p.Mitchells & Butlers, operator of All Bar One and Harvester pubs, added 5.8 per cent to 300.6p after Morgan Stanley increased its target price to 340p after spending a day visiting 12 pubs with the company’s new chief executive.“The confidence of both Adam Fowle and his pub managers was self evident, and the turnround of some of the weaker brands such as Harvester has been successful,” commented analyst Jamie Rollo.Chloride Group, a supplier of power systems and batteries, added 4 per cent to 167.8p on rumours that Emerson could return with another offer. Emerson had a 270p a share offer for Chloride rebuffed in June 2008.However, traders reckoned the rise had more to do with speculation that Chloride could be a beneficiary of a new government policy to promote electric cars.Desire Petroleum surged on Thursday after the energy explorer became the first to secure a rig to drill on the Falklands Islands since 1998, write Miles Johnson and Neil Hume.The news sparked buying of other Falklands-based explorers, including Desire’s partner Rockhopper – up 51 per cent to 58.5p – and Borders & Southern, which rose 18.4 per cent to 58p.“Securing a rig has been the key to near-term share price performance and this is very good news,” said Seymour Pierce. “While a clearer view on valuation awaits well results, we believe the shares will perform well ahead of the drilling campaign”.Oriel, meanwhile, argued the news was positive for all Falklands explorers, noting that the other companies could use the same rig as Desire while it was in the area. Desire shares closed 39.5 per cent higher at 90p.Bahamas-focused energy company BPC fell 4 per cent to 2.8p after RAB Capital offloaded its stake into the market. Novus Capital Markets won the business, placing 270m shares to institutions.Jarvis surged 32 per cent to 23¾p after the rail network services group, chaired by one-time Conservative party London Mayoral candidate Steven Norris, said it had been approached by a potential buyer.Elsewhere, confirmation from IT company Redstone that it had received a preliminary approach sent its shares up 25 per cent to 5.6p. Redstone shares had risen 38 per cent since Monday.Ingenious Media rose 27 per cent to 42p after one of its non-executive directors, Patrick McKenna, purchased a tranche of shares in the company at 40p each, taking his total stake to 15.5 per cent.Daniel Stewart, the investment bank, gained 4 per cent to 3p following news that it had secured a ₤2.3m investment from Middle Eastern bank Prime Holding.
224;HD;Home Depot;2009-09-02T21:51:58Z;Views you can use;;The schoolteacher was not happy with the inflatable solar system set that was meant to be engaging and educating children in the classroom, and went on the supplier’s website to say so. “I opened the package, blew up the planets, hung them in my classroom, and came in the next day to find three blobs of rubber hanging from the ceiling,” complained the teacher last September. “Totally disappointed!!!!”The blow-up solar system had been bought from Oriental Trading Company, a US catalogue and internet retailer, for about $18. The teacher was not alone: at the end of last year, other customers buying the set from Oriental were just as unhappy – and were going online to say so.They complained in reviews on the company’s website that the sun, the eight planets and Pluto would often just not stay inflated.With customers regularly giving the product low scores on its site, Oriental contacted the manufacturer. By January, its customer service team was able to an­nounce that it had worked with the makers to make sure the planets stayed inflated. A series of five-star reviews suggests the deflation problem is over.The experience illustrates the evolution of a feature that is increasingly familiar in online transactions: originally seen as an aid to other potential buyers, on­line reviews are becoming a valued source of direct customer feedback for retailers and manufacturers.Samsung Electronics started hosting reviews on its US website last year, using technology and processing provided by Bazaarvoice, which has become the dominant provider of third-party review services in the US since it started in 2005 in a single office in Austin, Texas.Bazaarvoice now works with more than 500 brands belonging to companies including Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Boots, Argos, Lego and Procter & Gamble. It has 400 employees providing services in 25 languages, and offices in London, Paris and Singapore, says Brett Hurt, co-founder and chief executive.At Samsung, using reviews as a source of feedback “has changed some aspects of the way we work, primarily because of the speed with which information comes in”, says Kris Narayanan, Samsung’s director of marketing. “It helps us look at issues as they arise. If there is a malfunction or a problem then we identify it very early.”The company has used reviews in this way for less than a year, but Mr Narayanan says Samsung has already changed products in response to the new kind of feedback. For instance, large flat-panel televisions were initially produced with speakers on the side. When customers pointed out in their reviews that the units were too wide to fit into conventional cabinets, Samsung put the speakers below the screen.“It was certainly the product reviews that clinched the issue,” Mr Narayanan says.The Container Store, a US home storage retailer, plans to introduce customer reviews on its website this year to help shape product development. Using customer feedback is not new, says Casey Priest, marketing communications vice-president. “But that was based on people writing on customer comments sheets. This will take it to a whole new level.”Sears Holdings, which owns retailers Kmart and Sears, says it is increasingly passing on information from its online reviews to suppliers, says Rob Harles, head of Sears’s online community activities.For Samsung, reviews are just one of several sources of consumer input it monitors, including specialised discussion boards on consumer electronics websites such as CNet, as well as the less structured discussions on social media sites such as Facebook, MySpace and Twitter.With so much opinion to keep an eye on, the company tries to focus on analysing “qualified” input – opinions from customers who know what they are talking about. “We spend a tremendous amount of resources trying to parse through the qualified brand opinion,” says Mr Narayanan, rather than a spurious mention that does not truly represent meaningful input or opinion about the brand.Sam Decker, chief marketing officer at Bazaarvoice, says brands’ interest in such “social commerce”, as he calls it, has ballooned because it is more measurable, in contrast to the efforts of brands to analyse the less focused input from open social sites. “For all the hype and impact social networks make, it is a really thin bridge to what a company cares about, which is bottom line impact. We are trying to make this a very broad bridge. Not only is it measurable with the same measures that you use today, but the contacts with the customers are going to endure.”Internet shoppers are increasingly turning to reviews on websites. Nielsen, the marketing re­search group, says its twice-yearly global survey of more than 25,000 online consumers found in April that 70 per cent trusted product reviews posted online, an increase of 9 percentage points on April 2007.Bazaarvoice says it is seeing interest from manufacturers in putting its review service on their websites and then “syndicating” the reviews to retail sites such as Walmart.com.Brands have also begun using their most positive reviews in other marketing channels such as catalogues, or in-store marketing materials. Sephora, the cosmetics retailer, is testing in-store advertising that gives customers a code to access reviews on their mobile phones.Just two years ago, Mr Decker says, opening up a site to potentially critical third-party reviews was a big decision for retailers, and usually had to be approved by the CEO. Now, some retailers actively solicit reviews: Sears Holdings recently offered customers the chance to participate in a sweepstake by submitting reviews to its new MySears and MyKmart community websites.Argos, the UK catalogue retail­er, which started running customer reviews last year, found customers were 10 per cent more likely to buy products that had been reviewed on its site than those without them. When it e-mailed recent customers to ask them to submit reviews, the company received more than 200,000 in the first four months of 2009, with 70,000 in one day alone.
225;HD;Home Depot;2009-08-25T21:27:59Z;US stocks set record for year;;"US stocks once again set a record high for the year on Tuesday as encouraging economic data was enough to keep the rally going even in the face of a marked drop in the price of oil.Data from Case-Shiller and the Federal Housing Finance Agency suggested that home prices increased in June for a second consecutive month. This, added to an unexpectedly steep spike in consumer confidence, saw homebuilders and discretionary cosumer stocks lead the rally.This further bolstered optimistic sentiment, which was sparked early by president Barack Obama’s nomination of Ben Bernanke for a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.“The market wants continuity right now,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.“With Bernanke they know what they are getting, and equities are up slightly as a result.”The markets drifted from the morning’s highs during the afernoon, however, as a sharp dip in the price of oil put pressure on energy stocks, with Schlumberger falling 2.1 per cent to $56.13. But the economic data was enough to see all three closely-watched market measures close at new highs for the year.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished 0.2 per cent higher at 1,028.00 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index both gained 0.3 per cent to 9,539.29 and 2,024.23, respectively.Consumer discretionary stocks led after the confidence figures underlined promising results from Burger King and optimistic words from home improvement chain Lowe’s.Lowe’s rose 1.7 per cent to $21.07 after Don Stallings, president of Lowe’s Canada, said on Monday night that he saw recovery beginning in the first quarter of next year. That was followed on Tuesday by an upgrade from Morgan Stanley, as well as the news that the company would open stores in Australia in partnership with Woolworths.The promise of recovery also boosted shares in rival Home Depot 1.1 per cent to $27.32.Meanwhile Burger King saw profits rise 16 per cent, which lifted the shares 6.2 per cent to $18.75.Investors overlooked a lack of clarity about future sales, which the company said would be “soft” in the first half of the 2010 fiscal year, resulting in a lack of guidance on ull-year profits.Rival McDonald’s also gained, rising 1 per cent to $56.45.The hope that car production has reached a bottom spurred buying in car
radio maker Harman International Industries on Tuesday after JPMorgan said the company could see “a major turnround over the next two years”. Harman rose 9.8 per cent to $29.75."
226;HD;Home Depot;2009-08-19T01:14:01Z;Cost and inventory cuts boost US retailers;;US retailers reported better-than-expected second-quarter results on Tuesday, but their outperformance was driven largely by cost cuts and inventory reductions, rather than a sustained recovery in consumer confidence.Home Depot said net income in the three months to August 2 fell to $1.1bn from $1.2bn in the same period a year earlier. But the world’s biggest DIY retailer said it was seeing some recovery in demand in the hard-hit areas of California and Florida.Frank Blake, chief executive of Home Depot, attributed the improvement in California to recent good weather, together with efforts to spruce up repossessed houses in order to sell them on.This “churn” drove demand for products such as paint and carpets.But he expected rising repossessions to continue to damp demand for basic building materials.There was some evidence of consumers being more willing to make smaller purchases. However, cash-strapped consumers remain reluctant to splash out on bigger ticket items and demand from trade buyers also remained subdued.Mr Blake said it could be the second quarter or the second half of 2010 before Home Depot saw a rise in like-for-like sales.Sales fell 9.1 per cent in the second quarter to $19.1bn, while sales from stores open for more than a year fell by 8.5 per cent. US like-for-like sales were 6.9 per cent weaker. But operating costs fell 7.5 per cent to $4.56bn.The second quarter figure included a $20m operating charge related to the closure of about 40 home project planning stores. It also included a $50m benefit to net income from a favourable foreign tax settlement.Diluted earnings per share was 66 cents, compared with 71 cents per share in the second quarter of 2008. Excluding the charge for closing the unit, and the tax benefit, earnings per share totalled 64 cents, ahead of analysts’ expectations of 59 cents.Target, the discount retailer, also said its second-quarter profits were stronger than it expected, as efficiencies helped it to cut costs.Net income fell 6.4 per cent to $594m, while earnings per share slipped from 82 cents in the same period a year earlier to 79 cents.The allowance for bad debts in Target’s credit card business was stable at $1bn the end of the second quarter.Sales fell 2.7 per cent to $14.6bn, as like-for-like sales fell 6.2 per cent.Saks Fifth Avenue, the US department store chain, said its like-for-like sales fell 15.5 per cent in the second quarter, as the retailer continued to “experience weakness across all merchandise categories and geographies”.Saks made a net loss of $54.5m, or 39 cents a share, in the three months to August 1, compared with a deficit of $32.7m, or 24 cents a share, in the year earlier period. Excluding one-off items, the net loss was 40 cents per share, less than analysts had feared.
227;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Germany offers hope of global recovery;;Europe’s biggest economy offered renewed hopes for a global recovery on Tuesday as the International Monetary Fund identified a “nascent” but fragile upturn.Separately, the ZEW institute in Mannheim said that its closely watched survey of German investor confidence had jumped by 16.6 points to 56.1 points in August, the highest in three years.Also, Germany’s IAB labour market institute said that the country was likely to emerge from this year’s brutal downturn without suffering a large-scale increase in unemployment thanks to the government’s policy of subsidising wages.Olivier Blanchard, IMF chief economist, wrote in a paper due to be published on Wednesday that a global recovery is under way but warned that US policymakers are walking a tightrope in timing the end of their fiscal stimulus.In New York, retail stocks including Home Depot, Target and Saks rose sharply as the S&P 500 recovered some of Monday’s losses, gaining 1 per cent. However, it was cost-cutting rather than a resurgent consumer that helped the retailers.Mr Blanchard said that the US consumer was unlikely to step in to help growth when the fiscal stimulus was removed. He indicated that increased US exports to surplus countries in Asia were needed.But he said “it is clear” that the rebalancing may not take place, “at least not on the scale needed”.Marty Regalia, chief economist at the US Chamber of Commerce, forecast a recovery “in fits and starts” as consumers gradually regained confidence. However, he cautioned: “The consumer is not in total freefall but investment is still pathetic: who wants to put inventory on shelves when you’re not going to have customers coming through the door?”He also expressed doubt about any near-term rebalancing in global trade. “Yes, you’d like to see them go like gangbusters over there and spend like Americans. But the idea that China is going to be the saviour? I just don’t see it.”Mr Blanchard said that without a pick-up in external demand to the US – “central to any world recovery” – the stimulus could be maintained too long, adding an undesirable amount to the country’s debt burden, or choked off too soon, putting the recovery at risk.If fiscal deficits were maintained for too long, he wrote, there could be “worries about US government bonds and the dollar. . . causing large capital flows from the United States. Dollar depreciation may take place, but in a disorderly fashion, leading to another episode of instability and high uncertainty, which could itself derail the recovery.”Japan as well as Germany and Francereturned to growth in the second quarter, according to economic data published in the past few days, while most economists think that the US recession has ended or is coming to an end.“The turnround will not be simple,” said Mr Blanchard. “The crisis has left deep scars, which will affect both supply and demand for many years to come.”He noted that the recovery would be too slow to check the rise in the unemployment rate in many countries, which is at 9.4 per cent in last US data and above 10 per cent in parts of Europe.In Germany, Eugen Spitznagel, co-author of the IAB study, the first attempt to put a price tag on Berlin’s short-shift working scheme, said that the decision to cover part of the labour costs of companies that hold on to otherwise redundant workers would cost businesses €5bn this year, with the government putting up €6bn.But despite the high cost to business, he said, the scheme, described by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, as a “bridge to the next recovery”, looked likely to avert massive job losses in Germany next year as business sentiment turned more positive.The IAB’s conclusions challenge the widely held view – including at the European Central Bank – that government-sponsored short-time working schemes risk creating the wrong incentives, thereby delaying the economic recovery.“Our latest surveys of companies for the fourth quarter show hiring and firing intentions pretty much balancing each other over the next 12 months,” Mr Spitznagel said.Private sector economists said that the findings of the IAB, part of the Federal Labour Agency, which runs the unemployment insurance scheme, vindicated Berlin’s strategy.“If you thought the downturn would be a short-term event, which we did, then it makes sense to try and preserve jobs, both at a micro and macro level,” said Dirk Schumacher, economist at Goldman Sachs.Mr Spitznagel said that the €5bn cost to companies was roughly equivalent to the cost of rehiring qualified workers in the next upturn.Mr Schumacher still expected unemployment to rise next year. “We expect to breach the 4m mark, with a jobless rate of 9.7 per cent, by the middle of next year,” he said. “By comparison, unemployment peaked at more than 5m, or 12.1 per cent, in March 2005, in what was a much shallower downturn.”
228;HD;Home Depot;2009-08-18T20:33:56Z;Wall Street stages modest rebound;;"US stocks rebounded on Tuesday after the steepest decline in more than a month during the previous session.Financial stocks, retailers and materials companies, which led the market lower on Monday, all did well as buyers were tempted back into the market.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 1 per cent at 989.67. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.9 per cent to 9,217.94 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.3 per cent to 1,955.92.“A lot of people missed the rally in March and again in July,” said Chris Verrone, investment strategist at Strategas Partners. “Therefore any pull-back will be viewed as a buying opportunity.”Investors continued to focus on retailers as earnings season for the sector kicked up a gear with results from Home Depot, Target and Saks. For all three the pattern during the quarter was similar, with strict cost controls mitigating ongoing sales weakness.Home Depot recovered all of Monday’s losses, which were triggered by disappointing results from rival Lowe’s, after lower costs than expected helped it raise its full-year outlook. Its shares picked up 3.1 per cent to $26.93.Budget retailer Target also beat analysts’ estimates with revenues in line with expectations but profit margins improving. The stock climbed 7.6 per cent to $44.32.Upmarket chain Saks reported a similar story as carefully managed expenses kept costs low and helped it beat earnings estimates. Its shares gained 6.9 per cent to $5.72.“Only 43 per cent of companies that have reported their earnings have beat expectations on both the top and the bottom line,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential. “We need to see revenue growth in the next quarter,”Financial stocks led the way, however, helped in part by improving credit card losses. Citigroup climbed 3.5 per cent to $4.14 and Bank of America gained 2.1 per cent to $16.90.Goldman Sachs was upgraded to “buy” at Pali Research, which predicted continued strength in its fixed-income business, and the stock rose 2.1 per cent to $160.48.American Express, meanwhile, was upgraded by KBW after credit losses improved last month. Its shares picked up 4.3 per cent to $31.69.CIT was one of the strongest financial companies, up 2.9 per cent to $1.40 after the commercial lender announced a narrower loss than in the same quarter last year.On Monday the group announced that it had bought more time to fight off bankruptcy by completing a $1bn debt tender.But the rally in financial stocks was not replicated everywhere and economic data limited the bullish mood. Figures showed that deflation continued to
hamper producer prices.There was weakness among health insurers, which bucked Monday’s
losing trend on signs that the Obama administration could abandon the public insurer element of its healthcare reforms.Such a plan has been
criticised as undermining the private sector and, after campaigners hit back at suggestions that it might
be dropped, insurers gave back much of the previous session’s gains.Humana lost 1.5 per cent to $35 and Coventry Health Care fell 2.6 per cent to $22.98.Homebuilders recovered from early losses, which were triggered by data showing that builders started work on fewer homes last month than expected. But economists said the rise in the number of new single-family homes was good for the sector. Lennar and DR Horton both finished the day 2.8 per cent higher, at $13.19 and $12.22, respectively.Technology stocks also showed strength after a bruising previous session. Smartphone makers were particularly strong after RBC described the market as “the next wave of
computing” and raised its price targets on the three leaders in the sector.Apple, which makes the iPhone, climbed 2.8 per cent to $164. Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, picked up 4.6 per cent to $73.99. Palm, which recently launched the Pre, gained 4.9 per cent to $13.88."
229;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Lowe’s;;Home improvement in the US is doing anything but. Judging by second quarter numbers from Lowe’s on Monday, consumer confidence also risks becoming oxymoronic. Worse than expected sales from the world’s second largest DIY retailer caused its shares to drop by a tenth, and dragged larger peer Home Depot – due to report on Tuesday – down with it.Optimism that accompanied last quarter’s results has evaporated, with Lowe’s back to looking for signs of a bottom. Investors who have rushed into the bouncing shares of retailers should take note – a less drastic deterioration in trading is not the same as the start of a recovery. Shoppers are keen to plant their gardens with vegetables but bird seed and bin bags are poor substitutes for full scale renovation.Indeed, sales of big ticket items were worst hit at Lowe’s, with comparable sales of items priced over $500 down 16 per cent on the year before, versus an overall decline of 10 per cent. The absence of stimulus cheques and poor summer weather did not help, but homeowners remain unwilling to splash out – at least until property values begin to stabilise.Even then, it is worth considering expectations for the future. Lowe’s shares have fallen by two-fifths from their February 2006 peak, reflecting a fall in operating profits of the same magnitude – from $5.2bn in the year to February 2007, to the $3.2bn analysts expect this year.But hopes for future growth and profitability must surely be more modest now. Lowe’s had also been opening 150 stores a year but next year only intends to cut the ribbon on around 40. With the operating margin below 7 per cent, the 11 per cent once made will fade into memory. The market continues to look for evidence for a swift rebound. It is being met with thunderous silence.Lowe’s, the US home improvement retailer, reported on Monday that its second-quarter profits fell by 19.1 per cent as consumers continued to delay house projects, while uncertainty remains in the fragile market.Net income at the North Carolina-based company fell to $759m, or $5.48 a share, in the second quarter compared with profits of $938m, or $6.46, in the same period the year before. The result disappointed Wall Street analysts and the company’s stock price plunged.“Wavering consumer confidence, unseasonable weather in core markets and restrained customer spending compared with last year’s fiscal stimulus-aided results led to lower-than-expected sales in the second quarter,” Robert Niblock, Lowe’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Cautious consumers remain reluctant to take on discretionary projects until signs of economic improvement are more evident.”E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
230;HD;Home Depot;2009-08-17T18:47:48Z;Wall Street joins international slide;;"US stocks suffered their worst day since the beginning of July on Monday after the global sell-off triggered in Asia translated into heavy falls on Wall Street.Concerns over the health of the US consumer were at the forefront of investors’ minds after last week’s weak retail sales and consumer confidence figures sapped faith in this year’s rally in Asian equities.They were then exacerbated by worse-than- expected profit at Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, where sales saw the company miss its profit estimates and lower its full-year forecast.Its shares shed 10.3 per cent to $20.47 while rival Home Depot, which reports its results today, gave up 3.8 per cent to $26.11.The S&P 500 closed 2.4 per cent lower at 979.73. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2 per cent to 9,135.34 and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.8 per cent to 1,930.84.At the same time, volatility jumped, with the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility taken from options activity, rising 15 per cent to 27.90.“We shouldn’t expect to see the consumer out shopping yet but the market has got ahead of itself on this,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.Falling commodity prices also weighed on the markets after signs that the Chinese government may be slowing its stockpiling while lower quarterly growth than expected in Japan was another concern.Materials and energy stocks followed commodities lower.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, dropped 6.5 per cent to $12.41, and Freeport McMoRan, the copper and gold miner, lost 6.7 per cent to $59.36.In the energy sector Chevron dropped 2 per cent to $66.59 andExxon Mobilslid 2.4 per cent to $66.55.Technology companies, many of which rely on Asia for a significant proportion of their sales, also lost out.Intel, which makes 60 per cent of its sales in Asia, declined 1.7 per cent to $18.45 while IBM, where Asian sales make up 10 per cent of the total, was 1.4 per cent down at $116.86.IBM’s fall came in spite of news that the company may have found a way to use DNA to build microchips, which could be a cheaper option than current
methods.Dell, which is to work with China Mobile on a new smartphone handset for the Chinese market, fell 1.9 per cent to $13.93.“China has been a good leading indicator on growth - it led the markets up and now it might lead them down again,” said Mary Ann Bartels, technical research analyst at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.She added: “This is a normal correction. The number looks big but the rally was really big. We might yet see a pullback of between 10 and 15 per cent.”There was a broad flight from risky assets, which hit banking stocks hard. Bank of America lost 4.8 per cent to $16.56.Citigroup began the morning with heavy losses but clawed back some ground after saying its credit card write-offs fell last month. It ended 1 per cent down at $4.Shares in regional lender BB&T gave up 6.4 per cent to $26.43 after the company announced that it would sell $750m of shares to bolster its balance sheet following the purchase of Colonial, the failed Alabama bank.Health insurers bucked the trend, however, after signs over the weekend that the Obama administration might be willing to drop the public insurer element of its healthcare reform plans.Investors had worried a public insurer could undermine the private sector.But Kathleen Sibelius, secretary of health and human services, told CNN on Sunday that such an option was “not an essential element”.Coventry Health Care picked up 4.4 per cent to $23.60 while Aetna advanced 4.8 per cent to $29.63.Johnson & Johnson also showed resilience, falling only 0.4 per cent to $59.82 after Berkshire Hathaway, the group run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, increased its stake in the company.The investment group also took a stake in Becton Dickinson, which sells healthcare equipment, and its shares slipped only 0.1 per cent to $66.30."
231;HD;Home Depot;2009-07-14T20:48:45Z;Wall Street rises in choppy trade;;US stocks managed to rise during a choppy session on Tuesday as a stabilisation in the price of oil encouraged investors to buy shares in energy companies.The sector was one of the strongest during the day as oil slowed its recent slide. Schlumberger gained 1.7 per cent to $51.83 and Chevron picked up 0.9 per cent to $63.It was supported by firmer consumer stocks, which rose after advance figures showed retail sales higher in June than May.Home Depot climbed 2.5 per cent to $23.68 while rival Lowe’s advanced 1.6 per cent to $19.57.But the effect of the data was tempered by the fact that much of the rise had come from increased spending on petrol.“People have got the money in their pocket, but they are still not spending it, which is not a surprise given how much the oil price rise in June will have affected petrol prices,” said Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.5 per cent higher at 905.84, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 8,359.49 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.4 per cent to 1,799.73.Financial shares were mixed, even after Goldman Sachs reported much higher profits than expected.The bank had led a broad market rally on Monday after analyst Meredith Whitney, who turned bearish on financial stocks last year before many of her peers, recommended buying the shares.Ms Whitney said that Goldman’s profits would come in at $4.65 per share, much higher than the consensus view of $3.48, boosted by strong revenues from underwriting new issuance of stock and debt.Even her prediction proved overly-pessimistic though, as earnings were $4.93, excluding the amount Goldman had to pay back to get out of the government’s bail-out programme.The company managed to hold on to Monday’s gains, although did not build on them significantly, gaining 0.2 per cent to $149.66.“Most firms cannot play in Goldman’s league, so investors will focus more on earnings from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo to give them a sign on how financials are doing,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at thinkorswim.Other banks were mixed. Citigroup rose 5.1 per cent to $2.92 but Bank of America dropped 0.6 per cent to $12.91 and Wells Fargo gave up 1.6 per cent to $24.40.Elsewhere in the sector, shares in commercial lender CIT Group spiked following two sessions of heavy falls after the ailing company said that it was in “active” discussions with regulators about a possible government rescue before it has to pay back $1bn of debt next month.The renewed hope that the company may avoid bankruptcy sent the shares up 19.3 per cent to $1.61.Johnson & Johnson was the second large corporate group to report its second-quarter earnings and the world’s largest healthcare company managed to beat both revenue and profits forecasts.Its shares picked up 0.9 per cent to $58.23.CSX, the railway operator, also announced its profits on the busiest day yet for announcements this earnings season.The company’s shares jumped 7 per cent to $34.80 after it revealed better profits than Wall Street had expected. The performance came largely from cost-cutting, with revenues coming in roughly as analysts had predicted.Dell weighed on the technology sector after the company warned that its second-quarter profit margins would be weaker as customers bought cheap notebook computers rather than more expensive items on which Dell makes more of a profit. The shares lost 8.1 per cent to $11.97 and the news put some pressure on its rivals.IBM fell 0.4 per cent to $103.25 while Hewlett-Packard gave up 0.4 per cent to $37.14.Sun Microsystems added to the pessimism in the sector after it forecast a steeper quarterly loss than expected on weak revenues as the company lost business to its competitors.The shares managed to rise 0.1 per cent to $9.17, but those in Oracle, which is in the process of buying the company for $5.6bn, lost 0.4 per cent to $20.63.
232;HD;Home Depot;2009-06-30T21:21:49Z;US stocks slide on fading confidence;;US stocks registered their best quarter in a decade on Tuesday, in spite of falling during the day to take the markets lower for June.Equities continued to trade within a narrow range, holding on to the stellar gains made since the market bottom in March.But they sold off during the day, losing many of the gains made during the previous session, as oil prices and economic confidence both dipped.Oil prices continued to swing, and after the previous session’s rise, fell back below $70 a barrel on Tuesday. Energy companies followed, losing most or all of Monday’s gains. Chevron gave up 0.9 per cent to $66.25 and Exxon Mobil lost 1 per cent to $69.91.As well as falling commodities, poor economic news knocked confidence in equities, as investors worried about the future for the US consumer.US home prices continued their multi-year tumble in April, according to the S&P Case-Shiller home-price indices, although the decline was smaller for the third month in a row.This was coupled with indications that consumer confidence unexpectedly fell during June, exacerbating worries about how much individuals are likely to spend.The combined effect of the housing data and the consumer confidence numbers saw home improvement retailers suffer. Lowe’sgave up 0.3 per cent to $19.41 while its main rival Home Depot fell 1 per cent to $23.63.The only positive piece of economic news came from the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago, which said business activity shrank slightly less than forecast in June.But this was not enough to lift equities and the benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.9 per cent down at 919.32 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 8,447 and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 0.5 per cent to 1,835.04.That left the market more than 15 per cent higher for the quarter, the best since December 1998, and just a fraction higher for the month.“Much of the performance this quarter was simply taking back what was lost during the irrational falls in February when people were talking about bank nationalisations and the collapse of the financial system,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.But Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets, said the fact those gains were held in June was a positive sign: “Considering the run up we had in April and May if we come out of June roughly flat that will be pretty good.“We have had every excuse for a correction but the fact that we have held on to the rally shows there is quite a bit of support for the markets.”Hotel companies suffered on the concerns over consumer spending, but were also badly hit by a downgrade for Starwood Hotels from Wachovia, which said there was “anaemic” demand for the company’s core businesses.Starwood’s shares lost 1.9 per cent to $22.20, while those in Carnival dropped 1.2 per cent to $25.77 and those in Marriott International declined 0.5 per cent to $22.07.Ford bucked the trend of falling consumer stocks, after saying it has begun to capture market share following the bankruptcies of both GM and Chrysler. The promise of increased sales meant the company said it would make more cars than planned in the third quarter, and the shares gained 5 per cent to $6.07.Amazon was another retailer to find gains after analysts at Cowen and Company called the company “a next-generation Wal-Mart”, whose focus on low prices would help it increase market share.Its shares finished up 0.8 per cent at $83.66.Good earnings news also helped two other companies avoid the wider sell-off.Apollo Group, which runs educational institutions, saw profits jump 45 per cent as more students enrolled. Its shares rose 7.8 per cent to $71.12.Meanwhile, profits at H&R Block, the tax preparation company, topped Wall Street estimates, in spite of falling revenues. The company also forecast full year earnings at the upper end of analysts’ predictions, and the shares gained 10 per cent to $17.23.
233;HD;Home Depot;2009-06-25T20:43:58Z;Retail sector leads Wall Street rally;;"US stocks staged an impressive broad-based rally on Thursday with retail stocks leading the way.Home furnishings retailers fared especially well after Bed Bath & Beyond reported an unexpected rise in profits with cost cuts and new store openings making up for a fall in same-store sales. Its shares climbed 9.5 per cent to $31.08.That lifted rival retailers, with Home Depot rising 3.9 per cent to $23.57 and
Target gaining 4.2 per cent to $40.31. Lowe’spicked up 3.8 per cent to $18.87.Office Depot, meanwhile, jumped 7.8 per cent to $4.42 after Goldman Sachs said the $350m cash injection from BC Partners earlier this week could enable the retailer to merge with another company.An apparent stabilisation in sales of homewares also encouraged JPMorgan to upgrade shares in JC Penney, which gained 6 per cent to $28.20, lifting rival department stores with it.Kohl’s picked up 2.3 per cent to $44.43 and Macyâ€™s climbed 3.9 per cent to $11.83.But there was bad news elsewhere in the consumer sector as Nike reported quarterly earnings that missed consensus estimates once restructuring costs had been factored in.Investors were also disappointed by the news that forward orders had fallen 12 per cent and Nike shares lost 3.3 per cent to $51.28.Economic data showed that the US economy contracted 5.5 per cent in the first three months of the year, slightly less than had previously been estimated.But investors focused on the fact that more people claimed jobless benefits last week than expected.The data saw the markets open in negative territory but they then rose as Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified before Congress on last year’s takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America.Mr Bernanke was accused on Wednesday by a senior Republican of being part of a “cover-up” concerning what disclosures should be made about the deal.That knocked the market’s faith in the Fed on the day it decided to keep interest rates low, but some of that confidence returned on Thursday as Mr Bernanke defended his position.Mr Bernanke was also supported by President Barack Obama, who said he had confidence in the job he had done.“Mr Bernanke’s comments seemed fairly justifiable, and that probably held up the market a little bit,” said Nick Kalivas.“People seemed pretty nervous about the testimony but I am not sure there was anything there that constituted the smoking gun that might quicken his demise.”The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all rose 2.1 per cent to 920.26, 8,472.40 and 1,829.54, respectively.“It has been very difficult to push this market down,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “There has been a continual flow of investor money as the awareness grows that recovery is coming.”Bank of America fell during the morning, with many on Wall Street saying the investigation into the Merrill purchase could make Ken Lewis, chief executive, more vulnerable than Mr Bernanke.It was also hit by analysis from Citi, which warned that BofA could have a
difficult quarter as it builds capital in case of further loan losses.But the shares picked up ground during the day as nervousness about Mr Bernanke’s testimony abated. They closed flat at $12.35.There was a glimmer of hope on US housing as Stuart Miller, chief executive of Lennar, the homebuilder, said he sensed some pent-up demand from potential home buyers. This helped the company’s shares climb 17.5 per cent to $9.19, even though it reported a bigger loss than expected as falling house prices continued to take their toll.Other homebuilders were also lifted. Centex advanced 5.8 per cent to $8.58 while KB Homeclimbed 8.3 per cent to $14.77.There were encouraging signs on investor appetite as Medidata, a clinical technology company, made an impressive debut on the Nasdaq, jumping 21.4 per cent to $17 on the day of its initial public offering. The shares had initially been priced at $14."
234;HD;Home Depot;2009-06-17T15:15:17Z;Executives face up to inevitable changes;;In a July 2002 speech in New York, President George W Bush implored business leaders to heed the lessons that emerged from the collapse of Enron, WorldCom and other companies laid to waste by the actions of their top executives.“We need men and women of character who know the difference between ambition and destructive greed, between justified risks and irresponsibility, between enterprise and fraud,” Mr Bush said. “Those who sit on corporate boards have responsibilities.”Seven years later, his successor, Barack Obama, is preaching those same tenets to a corporate world whose reputation has been sullied once again by the behaviour of some of its great success stories.The financial crisis that overwhelmed some of the world’s banks, brokers and insurers last year exposed fresh weaknesses in corporate governance, leaving shareholders to question whether their long-term interests were sacrificed for the short-term gains of senior executives.Ken Daly, chief executive of the National Association of Corporate Directors, says: “Maybe more so than from the isolated Enron thing, there is a risk to the confidence in corporate America, a tearing of the fabric.”And just as the scandals, indictments and bankruptcies of earlier this decade gave rise to more independent boards and stiffer financial-disclosure rules, breakdowns at Bear Stearns, AIG and other fallen giants will prompt corporate directors and regulators alike to identify a new wave of reforms.Of course, they will be different, reflecting the set of circumstances that left the fate of some of the largest and most powerful financial services companies in the hands of traders and bankers who were compensated for their aggression and unchecked risk-taking.“The profound governance failures of the past year are different from Enron and WorldCom,” says Ben Heineman, a former senior vice-president for law and public affairs at General Electric and now a senior fellow at Harvard University’s law and government schools.“Those were intentional frauds committed by business leaders who blew through systems. Today’s financial crisis resulted primarily from negligence, where all the systems failed – failures in finance, accounting, risk, law, operational leadership, top leadership and the board.”US lawmakers have put forth proposals that, if passed, would alter the corporate governance policies of many companies.“Change is inevitable,” says Dennis Beresford, professor at the University of Georgia who sits on the boards of Fannie Mae, Kimberly-Clark and Legg Mason.One such measure would enhance shareholders’ ability to propose alternative candidates to management’s choice of directors. Another would give them a chance to voice their disproval of executive compensation while forcing corporate boards to create risk-management committees.Those committee members need to ensure a company’s various business units’ risks are aggregated, says Parvez Patel, vice-president of capital markets at risk for CapGemini Financial Services.The absence of this kind of oversight left top executives and boards at many of the large financial services firms unable to avoid the steep losses that followed their employees’ risks.“You need to understand what is happening on the front line of the business,” says Mr Patel. “And that information needs to percolate up through the oversight committee.”While new regulations may establish minimum standards or strengthen existing rules, shareholders alone can effect the kind of lasting reforms that would help companies avoid shortcomings that helped exacerbate the recent crisis. That is the view of Ralph Whitworth, whose activist money-management firm, Relational Investors, has sought to improve governance at companies such as Sprint Nextel, Home Depot and Genzyme.“The bottom line is that most directors in corporate America have high IQs and integrity, but lack the information and incentives to do their job,” says Mr Whitworth, a one-time adviser to T Boone Pickens, the oilman and corporate raider.“Investors can’t sit by the wayside and wait for government to address these problems. Are they going to pick up a cudgel and demand accountability? Within a capital system, accountability has to be exacted by the investors.”It is likely more companies will move to split the roles of chief executive and chairman, a move that help advance the independence of boards from company managements.Yale University’s Millstein Center for Corporate Governance and Performance, says: “The independent chair curbs conflicts of interest, promotes oversight of risk, manages the relationship between the board and the CEO, serves as a conduit for regular communication with shareowners, and is a logical next step in the development of an independent board.”But this bifurcation may not work well for corporations whose top executives receive hefty payments if their titles change, Mr Daly says. In these cases, the appointment of a lead director may be the best option.“There needs to be either separation or a designation of lead director,” he says. “Either can work. It is a matter of what’s best for the company.”Another shift that was already in train before the financial crisis struck is the way in which corporate boards reward their companies’ top executives.“Compensation is going to change enormously,” Mr Daly says.More companies will seek to align executive pay with long-term strategic goals, says Matteo Tonello, associate director of the Conference Board.“There will be a correction of the distortions in compensation incentives that were often used in the past, especially certain equity-based incentives – stock options,” Mr Tonello says.“They have proven by now to have had the unintended consequence of encouraging execs to pursue short-term behaviour in lieu of long-term business goals. Excessive risk-taking has been too common.”That being said, Mr Tonello notes the progress that many corporate boards have made in the past decade. It is unfair, he argues, to blame the financial-services meltdown on sub-standard corporate governance.While some reforms have come about as a result of new regulation, many others were voluntary.Boards have grown more independent, and less entrenched, Mr Tonello says. More directors maintain an open dialogue with investors.“They’re not cronies of the CEO,” he said.Another by-product of the financial crisis, a steep drop in many stock prices, may also embolden shareholders to take some of these corporate-governance reforms into their own hands.“There’s a heightened expectation of what directors can and should be doing,” Mr Daly explains.A complacent management team and board, coupled with disappointing results, can inspire the kind of ire that former Home Depot CEO Robert Nardelli drew in 2006.His performance at the home-improvement retailer’s annual meeting, in which he refused to answer questions and ended the event after just 35 minutes, alienated shareholders and outraged corporate-governance advocates.Within a year, he was gone.Still, the outrage that many investors feel – which, in turn, is driving many changes to corporate governance policies – may subside, as the economy recovers and share prices rebound.“Shareholders basically want performance,” Mr Beresford says. “For most of them, so long as the company is doing well, they’re basically satisfied. It’s only when something is underperforming that they start getting upset and blaming people.”Uncertain when their businesses will rebound from the severe downturn, many corporate boards will seek to do the next best thing: ensuring that managers have the right incentives to assure the recovery arrives as soon as possible.
235;HD;Home Depot;2009-06-16T20:29:29Z;Wall Street slides on consumer spending fears;;US stocks lost early gains on Tuesday as they headed towards a second consecutive session of losses.Investors worried about the health of consumer spending after Best Buy reported weaker sales than expected and falling profits.The company was expected to benefit from the demise of Circuit City, one of its main competitors, but instead it saw revenues fall as customers cut back on spending. The shares lost 7.3 per cent to $35.84.There was some positive news on the sector from Tyco Electronics, which makes electronic connectors. The company said sales had improved in consumer-related markets and profits may be almost three times higher than forecast. Its shares advanced 3.7 per cent to $19.98.But this could not prevent Best Buy’s weak sales from encouraging investors to sell shares in other retailers. Targetfell 3.7 per cent to $38.62 while Home Depot lost 2.7 per cent to $23.20.Stocks had been supported during the morning by rising commodity prices, but these fell again during the afternoon, extending the trend of the previous two sessions, dragging metal producers with them.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, dropped 5 per cent to $52.39 and Alcoa, which produces aluminium, declined 2.8 per cent to $10.90.Steelmakers, which have moved from stellar gains to sharp losses in the past few sessions, intially picked up ground after Nucor said orders had improved over recent weeks, helping it to project a narrower quarterly loss than expected.But Nucor was the only one to hold onto gains amid the sell-off and the shares closed 2.4 per cent up at $46.86.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 1.3 per cent down at 911.97, and 8,504.67 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 1.1 per cent to 1,796.18.“The market is rtrying to figure out right now whether this is some sort of correction that is building or if it is just a break in an extended recovery,” said Larry Coates, chief executive of Oak Value Capital Management.The rising price of commodities, and especially oil, was shown to have pushed inflation up in May as the Producer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent from April.But this was much more moderate than analysts had predicted, easing fears that inflation could hamper stocks later in the year.There was also a boost from figures showing that builders started work on many more homes in May than expected.But some analysts warned the headline figures on housing starts hid worrying trends.“Inventories remain high, and builders seem to be building to compete with cheap foreclosed houses, which will keep the pressure on prices,” said Brett Hryb, portfolio manager with MFC Global Investment Management.The positive effect of the economic data was further tempered by figures showing industrial production in May fell more than analysts had predicted.Healthcare was one of the few sectors to enjoy a positive day as investors bet President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms would have to be scaled back after the Congressional Budget Office said the current plan would leave 30m Americans uninsured.Health insurers have suffered on the White House plans, which include scaling back subsidies for those companies. But as the proposals came under attack, major insurers gained.Aetna rose 4.7 per cent to $23.58 and Coventry Health climbed 3.5 per cent to $16.71.The sector was further boosted by Amgen, the biotechnology company, whose shares climbed 3.6 per cent to $51.21 after they were upgraded by Sanford Bernstein. The broker said revenues and earnings should re-accelerate over the year.Citigroup dropped 3.6 per cent to $3.25 after Vikram Pandit, the chief executive, said companies would have to look elsewhere than American consumption for growth drivers as the US adjusts to slower growth and less credit.AT&T dropped 1.7 per cent to $24.22 meanwhile after its shares were downgraded by Barclays Capital, which said continuing high unemployment would make growth difficult.
236;HD;Home Depot;2009-06-10T21:39:43Z;Home Depot;;"Who does not wish to dance on the sunlit uplands of the recovered economy? Home Depot spent Wednesday describing to analysts what life will be like once the recession fades into memory. The home improvement retailer will be simplified, more mechanised and offer better service, while ultimately becoming more profitable. No doubt its employees will also sup on honeysuckle while investors recline on pillows stuffed with cash.For now the promise of 10 per cent operating margins and a 15 per cent return on capital employed lies in the non-specific long term. An updated outlook provided by Home Depot on Wednesday marked a change in expectations for the current year from extremely dreadful to merely dreadful. Sales to February 2010 are still forecast to fall by 9 per cent (after falling 8 per cent the year before). The “good news” is that adjusted earnings may fall as little as 20 per cent compared with the 26 per cent drop predicted in May.There are grounds for optimism. Cost-cutting is having an effect. When consumer spending does start to improve, there is potential to squeeze landlords and suppliers for better terms. Were the retailing landscape to become less aggressive in the recession’s aftermath, there may be an opportunity for retailers to avoid passing all such savings to consumers. And were Home Depot to make sales of $300 per square foot and an operating margin of 10 per cent – versus the consensus for $269 and 6.6 per cent this year – earnings would double.But the gloomy depths of the housing market have yet to be fully plumbed. The mania for home improvement is history, and consumers have only begun to pay down debt. Investors should not be too bewitched by dreams of tomorrow.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

237;HD;Home Depot;2009-06-10T20:45:54Z;Wall St slips on disappointing US debt sale;;US stocks slipped on Wednesday afternoon after a disappointing auction of government debt triggered a slump that was then erased by some positive economic news from the Federal Reserve.Equities had been drifting during the day, but took a noticeable dip after the end of the auction, which failed to attract the kind of bids the market was hoping for, exacerbating fears that high bond yields would push up interest rates.They then recovered after the Fed said that there were signs the that the economic contraction in some areas of the US was moderating.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite both closed down 0.4 per cent at 939.15 and 1,853.08 respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 8,739.02.“The economy is not falling quite so fast, but the big question is not how fast do we recover but how far do we recover. That is why stocks can’t break out of this range,” said Kim Caughey, investment analyst at Fort Pitt.Fears that rising interest rates would curb consumer spending took their toll on financial and consumer stocks.Morgan Stanley, which had been trading lower throughout the day after Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of rival Goldman Sachs, said the recession would be long and protracted, dropped further. Its shares closed down 5.6 per cent at $29.26. Goldman was 1.8 per cent lower at $146.68.Investors were particularly worried that mortgage rates would continue to rise on the back of higher bond yields. The recent climb in rates saw mortgage applications fall more than 7 per cent last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said on Wednesday.“Rising yields have been keeping a lid on stocks recently as falling bond prices attract investors away from equities,” said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at Wells Fargo Advisers.Charles Zhang, managing partner of Zhang Financial, said inflation remained a serious long-term worry. “The US government will have to increase yields to make Treasury bonds attractive,” he said.Citigroup rose however as it got its long-awaited $58bn stock swap under way, the day after the board met Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in an effort to diffuse growing tensions between the two parties. The shares rose 2.1 per cent to $3.48.Big name consumer stocks also suffered, including McDonald’s, which dropped 1.2 per cent to $58.36 and Disney, which lost 0.9 per cent to $25.10.Even the home improvement retailers, which had performed well in the morning after Home Depot improved its full-year profit outlook on better profit margins, later slipped back. Home Depot finished 0.2 per cent up at $24.39 while rival Lowe’s dropped 0.4 per cent to $20.37.Brown-Forman was one of the few consumer stocks to hold onto its gains after it reported better results than expected.The company, which owns the Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort drinks brands, saw sales fall less than analysts had predicted and its shares climbed 3.3 per cent to $46.74.Earlier energy companies had risen on the price of oil, which briefly topped $71 for the first time since October.Despite losing some gains ExxonMobil hung on to gains of 1 per cent to $73.84, while ConocoPhillips rose 0.5 per cent to $45.76.Metal producers had initially fared well on rising raw materials prices, but later in the day, only steel manufacturers continued to hold their gains. AK Steel was 5.2 per cent up at $20.09 while US Steel gained 6.1 per cent to $40.13. Meanwhile Ameriprise became the latest in a long line of financial companies to announce that it would issue shares in order to raise further capital. The financial services company said it might use the money to make acquisitions, although it did not name specific targets. Its shares fell 7.3 per cent to $26.33.Elsewhere, shares in real estate broker CB Richard Ellis rose 13.6 per cent to $9.25 after the company said it would raise $400m by selling bonds and a further $100m by selling shares to Paulson & Co, the hedge fund.

238;HD;Home Depot;2009-06-10T15:19:08Z;Oil rise boosts US energy stocks;;US stocks rose on Wednesday morning as Wall Street remained focused on inflation indicators, with commodity prices continuing to rise and the dollar slipping further.The price of oil briefly topped $71 for the first time since October last year, but then fell back. By mid-morning US crude was up $0.97 at $70.98.This boosted energy stocks, including Chevron, which gained 1.8 per cent to $71.43 and ConocoPhillips, which picked up 1.9 per cent to $46.40.Other commodities also continued the week’s gains, with rising metals prices driving shares in Alcoa, the aluminium producer, which rose 3.1 per cent to $11.50 and Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, which advanced 2.6 per cent to $60.47.Materials ane energy stocks drove the benchmark S&P 500 index higher, and after half an hour of trade, it was 0.4 per cent up at 946.44. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 8,812.26 but the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.2 per cent to 1,856.38.Home Depot boosted the consumer sector after it said profits may be flat this year, having previously forecast a 7 per cent decline. The company reaffirmed its sales targets, but said profit margins could be slightly higher. Its shares lifted 1.9 per cent to $24.80.The news also helped rival home improvement retailer Lowe’s find gains, picking up 0.9 per cent to $20.65.Brown-Forman added to the optimism on consumer spending after it reported better results than expected. The company, which owns the Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort drink brands, saw sales fall less than analysts had predicted and its shares climbed 2.8 per cent to $46.55.Banking stocks were sluggish on the growing signs of inflation and economic data showing mortgage applications fell over 7 per cent last week.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which both said on Tuesday that they had been granted permission to repay money from the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program, saw their price targets lifted at JPMorgan, which cited the strength of the companies’ fixed income units.But shares in both companies fell after Lloyd Bankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, said the current upturn in global markets did not signal the end of the recession, saying it would be long and protracted. Shares in Goldman lost 0.9 per cent to $147.91 while Morgan Stanley fell 2.4 per cent to $30.25.Citigroup finally got its long awaited $58bn stock swap under way, the day after the board met Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Desposit Insurance Corporation, in an effort to diffuse growing tensions between the two parties. Even though Ms Bair did not address the position of Vikram Pandit, the chief executive whom the regulator is pushing to replace, people close to the matter said the meeting had a conciliatory tone. The shares rose 4.7 per cent to $3.57.Meanwhile Ameriprise became the latest in a long line of financial companies to announce it would issue shares in order to raise further capital. The financial services company said it might use the money to make acquisitions, although it didn’t name specific targets. Its shares fell 9.2 per cent to $25.79.Elsewhere, shares in real estate broker CB Richard Ellis spiked 15.5 per cent to $9.40 after the company said it will raise $400m by selling bonds and a further $100m by selling shares to Paulson & Co, the hedge fund. The company also said it may sell up to $50m more in equity and use the money to pay off debt.European stocks were higher early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was up 1.7 per cent at 884.31. Asian equity markets closed mainly up, led by the Nikkei 225 average, which closed 2.1 per cent higher at 9,991.49Bond yields were generally up, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rising 2 basis point to 3.876 per cent although that on the two-year note fell 1bp to 1.294 per cent.The dollar was weaker against major currencies early in New York, losing 0.7 per cent against the pound to $1.64.Gold was trading $0.01 higher at $954.79 per troy ounce.
239;HD;Home Depot;2009-05-26T20:45:08Z;Wall St recovers on boost in confidence;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday as figures showed that consumer confidence improved much more than expected in May.That erased early concerns about the impact of North Korean nuclear tests and a record fall in house prices.The rise in consumer sentiment, which was the biggest since 2003, saw consumer discretionary stocks jump 2 per cent almost immediately.Home improvement retailers Lowe’s and Home Depot performed strongly, gaining 3.5 per cent to $20.04 and 4.1 per cent to $23.80 respectively. Best Buy, the electronic goods retailer, also saw impressive gains, picking up 5.3 per cent to $37.05.That helped the benchmark S&P 500 index gain 2.6 per cent to 910.33, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.4 per cent to 8,473.49 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 3.5 per cent to 1,750.43.Some economists, however, warned that the rise in confidence might not translate into a rise in spending.“Part of the rebound in confidence is a result of the rebound in equities, so there may be some circularity there,” warned Paul Dales, USA economist at Capital Economics.“Also, we may be seeing a step change here where spending does not necessarily increase with confidence. Job losses and falling house prices may mean people simply don’t have the money.”Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, agreed. “A lot of investors’ ambitions are going to be dashed pretty soon, but for now the market wants to go higher. It seems to be setting itself up for a fall though,” he said.But in the immediate aftermath of the figures, investors were enthused.The figures also helped the technology sector, providing a particular boost to consumer-focused companies. Apple was the strongest riser, having been given an earlier fillip after Morgan Stanley upgraded the company, saying the iPhone will see its profits beat estimates for the next two years. The shares picked up 6.8 per cent to $130.78.Its rival Microsoft climbed 3 per cent to $20.34, while Google, which is also exposed to the consumer because of its reliance on advertisers for revenue, rose 2.8 per cent to $404.36.The gains came in spite of geo-political concerns over the repercussions of North Korea’s missile test, which took their toll on oil prices in early trade. That in turn knocked shares in energy companies.But both oil and energy stocks rebounded amid the economic optimism. Chevron advanced 1.9 per cent to $65.66 while Exxon Mobil rose 1.4 per cent to $69.81.Meanwhile figures showed that US house prices dropped at a record pace during the first quarter of this year, and fell nearly 20 per cent in March from the same period last year. That kept financials down during the morning, but they too felt the effect of the consumer confidence data.Citigroup closed 2.7 per cent up at $3.77 while JPMorgan gained 6.2 per cent to $36.54.Telecommunications companies also saw gains after QWest was raised to “overweight” by JPMorgan, which said the company had seen relatively strong sales with business clients. The shares rose 8 per cent to $4.33.Target edged higher as the battle between its board and William Ackman, the activist investor, continued. Barron’s, the investment magazine, questioned Mr Ackman’s plan to place the retailer’s properties into a trust and lease them back, and the shares gained 0.6 per cent to $41.General Motors saw a turbulent day’s trade ahead of the midnight deadline the company has set for its debt holders to accept the terms of its proposed debt-for-equity swap.The bondholders are widely expected to reject the deal, which caused the stock to fall in early trade.But they spiked over 40 per cent in the afternoon on the news that the United Auto Workers union has agreed to cut the payment of stock to a UAW healthcare trust by 55 per cent, giving GM more to spread among creditors.They then fell back again as investors realised there would almost certainly be no agreement between the bondholders and the company. They finally closed 0.7 per cent higher at $1.44.“It’s a peculiar trade now,” said Mr Wilkinson. “If GM files for bankruptcy the shares are worthless.”
240;HD;Home Depot;2009-05-19T20:40:32Z;Wall Street slips in choppy trade;;US stocks recovered early losses on Tuesday but finished a choppy session slightly lower as Wall Street digested data from the commerce department showing that builders had started to build fewer homes in April than any month since 1959.Investors had been hoping for a positive start after home improvement retailer Home Depot reassured the market by earning more in the first quarter than analysts had predicted.Stocks slipped after the opening as the market reacted to headlines from the housing figures. But as the day wore on those losses were erased, with several economists saying good news was buried in the data.“Given the historical volatility, such a big fall will probably be reversed in May,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “Housing activity may still be close to a floor, if it hasn’t reached it already.”Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, agreed, saying: “People read the report and realised it wasn’t so bad. The fall was driven by lower numbers of condominiums being built and the figures point that the housing market has found a bottom.”Financial stocks suffered on the data however. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and American Express all fell despite reports the companies are ready to pay back bail-out money.Goldman’s shares lost 1.4 per cent to $141.15, while JPMorgan, whose chief executive Jamie Dimon said the bank could pay back taxpayers’ money “within weeks”, lost 3.9 per cent to $35.81.American Express meanwhile said on Tuesday it would cut 6 per cent of its workforce – a total of 4,000 jobs – in an effort to save $800m over the rest of the year.But investors responded negatively to the restructuring plans, sending the shares down 5.1 per cent to $24.79.Of the banks believed to be ready to join the first group of companies approved to repay government money, only Morgan Stanley rose during the day, as it rose $596m by selling its remaining stake in its former investment analysis business MSCI. The shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.91.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.2 per cent down at 908.13, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent to 8,474.85.The Nasdaq Composite index rallied, however, helped by a 2.4 per cent rise in Hewlett Packard‘s shares to $36.58 ahead of the company’s results, which were to be released after the bell.Volatility dropped to levels last seen before Lehman Brothers went bust last September as investors took confidence from another day of rallies.“With the pull back last week, all the strategists are now thinking they have maybe missed their opportunity and so have come running back into the market,” said Pran Tiku, chief investment officer at Peak Financial.Homebuilders remained lower throughout the day, however, as the data continued to weigh.Pulte Homes finished 2.6 per cent lower at $10.03, while its prospective merger partner, Centex, dropped 2.9 per cent to $9.56.Investors also looked to earnings from Home Depot, the biggest US home improvement retailer, for clues on the state of the housing market.The company beat analysts’ profit forecasts after keeping costs low.But the shares slipped, with investors taking profit following a 6.6 per cent rise during the previous session on the back of results from its smaller rival, Lowe’s. They ended the day 5.3 per cent down at $24.63.There was some relief for Saks, the upmarket retailer, whose shares jumped 17.9 per cent to $4.81 as it reported a narrower loss than had been expected after cutting costs and inventories to cope with the consumer slump. The company warned sales would continue to decline for the rest of the year and said it would keep cutting costs to compensate.The steel sector performed well on figures showing raw steel production in the US rose last week. US Steel lifted 4.9 per cent to $29.94 and AK Steel climbed 5.9 per cent to $13.36.Medtronic, the largest US medical device maker by market value, fell 6.5 per cent to $31.76 after reporting disappointing profit and warning that its growth in 2010 would be below consensus estimates.
241;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Home Depot chief warns on US housing;;Growing optimism over the US housing market may be premature, a leading retailer warned on Tuesday.Frank Blake, chief executive of Home Depot, said housing market signals were still mixed.“We are concerned about the accelerating rates of foreclosures, particularly in the western part of the country,” he said, noting that one out of every 54 homes in California was in foreclosure.Mr Blake said that a slowing foreclosure rate in California during the fourth quarter had led to an improvement in regional store sales but the trend had then reversed as foreclosure rates rose again in the first quarter.The shift “provides a cautionary note on signalling a recovery prematurely”, he said. “Before we see real improvement we believe we need to see sustainable deceleration in foreclosures.”There were 342,038 foreclosure filings in April, according to data from RealtyTrac, an increase of 1 per cent from the previous month and up 32 per cent from last year.Mr Blake also noted that stores in regions that performed better than last year during the quarter were seeing only a slower rate of decline in comparable sales rather than increases.“Getting to less bad is not the same as getting to recovery,” he said.Comparable sales at Home Depot’s US stores fell 8.6 per cent during its first quarter while sales including stores in Canada, China and Mexico fell 10.2 per cent. Total revenues fell 9.7 per cent to $16.2bn.Under Mr Blake, Home Depot has been focusing on reducing costs, halting new store growth and improving store service and operations and logistics. In January, it announced 7,000 job cuts and closed about 40 smaller stores.Smaller transactions and sales of repair and maintenance goods were stable but larger sales related to home projects and discretionary purchases were down sharply.The retailer said it was also seeing strong sales of security equipment such as outdoor lighting and locks. Other retailers have reported robust sales of handguns and safes.On an adjusted basis, excluding charges, net earnings fell 18 per cent to $587m, or 35 cents per diluted share. Unadjusted earnings were $514m, or 30 cents a share. Its shares were down 5.34 per cent at $24.63 in New York trading.
242;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Lowe’s sees signs of US consumer revival;;Lowe’s on Monday reported a decline in first-quarter profits, but the home-improvement retailer’s chief executive suggested that improving consumer confidence and optimistic signs from the housing market could signal that the worst of the recession was over.The cautiously upbeat assessment came as the retailer reported a fall in first-quarter profits of more than a fifth and a 7 per cent decline in like-for-like sales.In spite of the weak first quarter, Robert Niblock, chief executive, expressed hope the US economy was showing signs of recovery.“There have been some encouraging signs in recent weeks to suggest that perhaps the worst is behind us,” he said. He warned, however, that he expected macro­economic “headwinds” to remain strong for the remainder of the year.Mr Niblock said budget-conscious shoppers had focused on maintenance and repair work during the first quarter, rather than big home project work, and were increasingly turning to doing work themselves in an effort to save money.Mr Niblock said consumers had increasingly moved away from the “do-it-for-me” trend that had supported the growth of installation and maintenance services in previous years and were returning to “do-it-yourself” work, leading to better foot traffic at its stores but smaller transactions. “Many homeowners have gone back to doing some of the things they previously relied on others to do,” he said.The focus on repair works led to comparatively strong sales of paint and sales of hardware and plumbing items, but comparable declines of about 25 per cent in sales of fitted cabinets that were sold on an installed basis. Large projects account for about a third of the retailer’s sales. Sales of seeds for vegetable plants and seeds rose by more than 20 per cent as people sought to save money.As a result of the shifts in shopper behaviour, the number of transactions for $50 or less were stable during the quarter, while transactions for more than $500 were down 14 per cent.Lowe’s overall comparable sales were down 6.6 per cent. It operates more than 1,600 stores in the US and Canada.Lowe’s first-quarter profit fell by 21.6 per cent to $476m, or 32 cents a share, compared with $607m, or 42 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales slid by 1.5 per cent to $11.5bn.The results sent shares of Lowe’s 8.1 per cent higher to close at $19.94 on Monday.Analysts forecast that Lowe’s would produce net income of 26 cents a share on $11.6bn of sales.Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, will report its first-quarter results Tuesday.
243;HD;Home Depot;2009-05-18T20:33:29Z;US stocks rally on retail hopes;;"US stocks rebounded on Monday following their first bruising week since the rally began in March as encouraging results from Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, raised hopes the economy would soon reach a bottom.Lowe’s, which is particularly sensitive to the housing market, easily beat analysts’ profit expectations, in spite of falling sales.The company also raised its outlook for the year as Robert Niblock, chief executive, boosted sentiment, saying: “We have seen consumer confidence improve [and] housing turnover show signs of a bottom.” Its shares rose 8.1 per cent to $19.94.Shares in rival, Home Depot, due to report on Tuesday, also performed well, rising 6.6 per cent to $26.02.Wal-Mart also picked up after Barron’s investment magazine said the stock was cheap, pointing out the company bought 19m of its own shares in the last quarter.Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal said the supermarket chain would revamp its electronics lines to attract customers who used to shop at the now- bankrupt Circuit City. Wal-Mart’s shares gained 3.7 per cent to $49.92.The optimism came after the market sold off last week following data showing retail sales fell in April.It helped the benchmark S&P 500 index advance back above 900 and into positove territory for the year, climbing 3 per cent to 909.71 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.9 per cent to 8,504.08 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained
3.1 per cent to 1,732.36.Meanwhile, Mr Niblock’s words on housing were supported by a survey showing confidence among US homebuilders increased to its highest in eight months.The growing optimism helped Lennar, the homebuilder, outpeform most of the S&P, up 13.7 per cent to $10.02.The company was further boosted by an upgrade from Citigroup, which cited improved liquidity following a recent debt sale.Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital, said: “Housing demand is beginning to respond to lower rates and off-the-chart affordability. But it is not clear whether this will mitigate what might happen later this year as people default on their loans.”Banking stocks also fared well amid the economic optimism after Goldman Sachs named Bank of America as a “conviction buy”. Goldman said BofA had made good progress on raising capital and had enjoyed a “solid” quarter in its mortgage and capital markets businesses.Meanwhile, Citigroup raised its full-year earnings outlook for the company to include what it made by selling its stake in China Construction Bank.Although Citi said BofA’s recent share issue meant 2010 earnings would be lower than previously thought, its analysts also commented that the bank may have already raised $4bn of the $17bn hoped for, suggesting the market is responding well to the increased supply.BofA’s shares rose 9.9 per cent to $11.73.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, which are almost certain to be among the first banks to be allowed to repay government loans, rose 6.5 per cent to $143.15 6.7 per cent to $37.26, respectively.Even State Street, the fund manager, rose, in spite of announcing that it would issue $1.5bn of new stock as it looked to repay government bail-out money. The company also said its full-year operating profit would be below analysts’ predictions as it took a $3.7bn write­down after moving items on to its balance sheet.But the stock gained amid the wider buying, picking up 8.5 per cent to $41.79.State Street was the latest company to have recently issued shares, a trend that Nick Kalivas, analyst at MF Global, said was not encouraging. He said: “Capital-raising hints that profit growth may not be strong enough to facilitate business needs.”But Ben Warwick, chief investment officer at Sovereign Wealth Management, said: “The market seems to be absorbing the extra equity well. It looks like there is enough demand to soak up the additional supply.”Investors continued to bet on the immediate survival of MGM Mirage, the casino operator.They sent the shares 14 per cent up to $8.74 after JPMorgan upgraded the stock, saying bankruptcy was “off the table for two years, if not longer”."
244;HD;Home Depot;2009-05-17T14:44:12Z;Store level focus;;When Frank Blake, chief executive of Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, wants to pay an unannounced visit to one of the company’s 1,900 US stores, he sometimes wears a hat to disguise his large and noticeably unhairy head.Most of the time being bald is “an advantage”, he says, but not when snooping around the shop floor. “When people see me, they go: ‘OK, I’ve got it: it’s the bald guy’,” he says. “But if I wear a hat, that actually makes it a little more difficult.”Few employees would have recognised Mr Blake, even without a hat, when he arrived in the top office at Home Depot in January 2007. He took over from Bob Nardelli, the high-profile CEO who resigned after a shareholder revolt over the retailer’s declining performance.“If you had asked most folks at Home Depot, I don’t think they would have said, ‘Oh OK, if Nardelli left, Frank Blake would have the CEO’s job.’ For good or ill, I think I was relatively an unknown quantity,” he says.At that time, Mr Blake was head of business development and corporate operations, where he had headed Mr Nardelli’s drive to expand Home Depot beyond its retail stores and into the wholesale supply business.A lawyer by training, Mr Blake lacked the retail experience that might have been expected of the choice to take control of the troubled business, which he had joined in 2002. Like Mr Nardelli, he was an alumnus of General Electric, where he worked from 1990 to 2001, rising to become responsible for growth strategies and mergers and acquisitions under Jack Welch.But Home Depot’s board decided to stick with a GE man, in spite of what Mr Blake calls, with typically wry understatement, the fact that “GE has a sort of mixed legacy at Home Depot, as you can imagine”.Now, more than two years later, Mr Blake seems every inch the home improvement retailer, rather than the traditional corporate GE executive. A lanky New Englander who turns 60 this summer, he is visiting the New York office of the Financial Times wearing a sweater and jacket but no tie, and with the look of a man who could probably put up his own shelves, or prune his own apple trees, and who confesses to a delight in the stuff his DIY superstores sell.“I’m not someone who goes in and knows a ton of stuff. And yet the product is really cool,” he says of the aisles stacked with everything from diagonal-nosed pliers to washing machines.The GE background, he argues, helped in his dramatic reversal of the course set by his predecessor, particularly what he calls Mr Welch’s stress on “understanding the need for simplicity and focus”.“It’s a constant thing for me …I’m a lawyer by training, so my reaction is ‘give me black and white and I’ll give you grey’ …[But] you just need to make things simple and make sure that everybody in the organisation understands what the organisation’s priorities are.”Within months of his arrival in the top job, Home Depot had sold its HD Supply wholesale unit, for $8.5bn, one of the steps demanded by Relational Investors, the activist investment group that had campaigned against Mr Nardelli. Relational had a seat on the retailer’s board within weeks of Mr Blake taking over.The retailer then announced it would restructure its capital, with plans – currently only half completed – to return cash to shareholders by buying back $22.5bn in shares, funded by the HD Supply sale and a planned $12bn bond issue.In May 2008 – already struggling with the impact of the US housing slowdown – it announced it was dramatically slowing new store expansion plans, down to around 20 a year from more than 200 in 2006, writing off $547m in investment it had made in new site development. It also announced its first-ever closures of 15 under-performing stores.Beyond the economic slowdown, the move was also a recognition of what Mr Blake says was previously a taboo idea: that Home Depot had reached the limits of store expansion in the US, and would concentrate on the profitability of its existing stores.“Our business model was one that fed off of new square footage. And saying: ‘No, our business model is going to feed off of productivity and effectiveness of our existing stores’ …is a mindset change.”It also represented a break with some of the strategies he had spearheaded under Mr Nardelli, most significantly the expansion of the wholesale business. Mr Blake jokes that he somehow missed out on “the conglomerate gene” at GE, whose businesses range from power plants to trains and credit cards. But he also shows rare unease and reticence when asked if he had always harboured doubts about the strategy, even as he drove it forward under Nardelli.“You have to have a certain belief …you have to believe in principles of management, and transferability of management techniques,” he says, arguing that the wholesale supply business is fundamentally different from running retail stores. “I’m not saying [the principles] aren’t true, but [they] aren’t mine.”Focusing on existing stores also touched on one of the big criticisms of Mr Nardelli at Home Depot: that he had tried to introduce a top-down, GE-style ap­proach that had eroded the entrepreneurial spirit established by Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank at individual store level when they founded the retailer in 1979.“There are a lot of operational differences between the GE business and Home Depot, and very significant cultural differences between GE and Home Depot,” says Mr Blake, who determinedly steers away from comparisons between his own low-key approach and the hard-charging and famously egotistical Mr Nardelli.Mr Blake’s early steps included visiting and studying experiences at McDonald’s, the fast food company, and JC Penney, the middle-American department store chain, which had both significantly improved their reputations for customer service.In 2008, the company increased the money available for incentive bonus payments for staff at successful stores, known as “reward sharing”. The effects included greater creative thinking by store managers, says Mr Blake, to the point that almost every store seems different as he travels the country.His strategy has largely won over Wall Street, despite four years of consecutively falling comparable store sales, the toughest years the retailer has ever faced.The only benefit, he says, and one he would be happy to forgo, is that “in some ways the tough times make it easier for people to grasp change”.The recession is expected to reduce Home Depot’s US sales this year by $15bn from a peak of $79bn in 2006.But Mr Blake is optimistic. “We’ve got just a phenomenal opportunity in front of us.”In the meantime, one thing is getting harder. After two and a half years, store staff are increasingly able to recognise the boss – even when he is wearing a hat.
245;HD;Home Depot;2009-05-07T20:07:08Z;Wal-Mart to end monthly sales data;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said on Thursday it was pulling out of one of the great rituals of the US industry - the monthly delivery of same store sales by many of the largest retail chains.Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, said in a statement the retailer believed the move would ”reduce the intra-period volatility related to events such as calendar shifts” and reflected the company’s focus on long-term strategy.Wal-Mart announced the change as it said sales at its US stores open at least a year had risen by 5 per cent in April. The sales figures were boosted by strong demand, new customers and by the fact that this year’s Easter holiday fell in April, rather than in March, as it did last year.The retailer’s March comparable sales were this year conversely comparatively subdued because of the Easter shift, increasing by just 0.6 per cent at its US supercenters and discount stores. Wall Mart’s shares subsequently dropped around 6 per cent, despite the retailer having reported sales growth in key categories.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of the company’s US stores, expressed exasperation with Wall Street analysts and investors for over-reacting to the low March figure, and failing to understand the significance of the Easter shift.“The market sometimes forgets that the calendar has an enormous impact on retail and particularly retailers like Wal-Mart that depend heavily on when a Friday falls,” he said.Wal-Mart will now join Sears Holdings, Home Depot, Lowe’s, the supermarkets and many other large retailers who opt to report comparable sales on a quarterly rather than a monthly basis.In February last year, Macy’s, the largest US department store also stopped issuing monthly same store numbers, citing volatility concerns as it began an overhaul of its stores. But it started again in October, saying it wanted “to provide investors as much information and transparency as possible” as uncertainty over the economy deepened.Wal-Mart’s strong sales during the recession have had a strong impact on industry-wide indices used to track the monthly same-store sales.Retail Metrics, a company that tracks the monthly figures, said that without Wal-Mart, its index for April sales would have fallen 2.7 per cent, rather than the 1.5 per cent rise reported including Wal-Mart.Brian Sozzi, retail analyst at Wall Street Strategies, said he believed Wal-Mart’s move reflected its management’s desire to get investors to focus on its long term outlook, reflecting its shift from being a growth to a value investment. He also said he expected other retailers to follow Wal-Mart’s lead in abandoning the monthly figures. “It’s going to take someone like a Wal-Mart to take the lead to do this,” he said.
246;HD;Home Depot;2009-05-04T19:27:56Z;Optimism builds;;"Almost two months after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, uttered the words “green shoots” of recovery in a television interview, debate continues to rage as to whether the world economy is starting to stabilise and will soon turn the corner.Compared with the start of the year – when the global economy was falling off a cliff in a synchronised contraction of unprecedented rapidity – the situation has improved dramatically. While almost all of the world’s leading economies are still shrinking, some at a still very rapid pace, forward-looking economic data point at least to a moderation in the rate of decline and potentially much more.The outlook in many parts of Europe – including the UK and Germany – and in Japan has not brightened very much, but the outlook in the US and China, the two most plausible engines of global recovery, looks better.Four developments in particular hold promise for the future: some easing in financial conditions globally; a pick-up in growth in China; an apparent bottoming out in US home sales and house construction; and a patchy increase in US consumer spending.The question is whether the plateauing in global activity apparently in train is the final bottom in this economic cycle and whether the so-called “green shoots” represent the beginnings of a sustainable rebound.Lawrence Summers, senior economic adviser to US President Barack Obama, remains cautious. He told Fox News on Sunday April 26: “That sense of unremitting free fall that we had a month or two ago is not present today.” But he added: “It’s going to be a very long road. There are going to be steps forward and there are also going to be steps backwards.”In most recessions, a slowing in the rate of decline naturally leads to a bottoming and then a recovery as investors, businesses and consumers stop worrying about economic Armageddon, satisfy themselves that past excesses have been worked out and start buying, hiring and spending again.The New York-based Economic Cycle Research Institute says the US is “on the cusp of a growth rate cycle upturn” – a slowing in the rate of decline. It adds: “Over the last 75 years, growth rate cycle upturns during every recession were followed zero to four months later by the end of the recession itself. No exceptions.”In fact, as the ECRI admits, there is one exception: the Great Depression in 1931. This may not be Great Depression Mark II but nor is it a normal recession, and the parallels with 1931 are close enough to worry that the usual transition from slowing decline to stabilisation and recovery might not hold this time either.There will be a temporary fillip to growth later this year from a classic inventory cycle. Manufacturing companies cut production so fast in the final quarter of 2008 that production is now running below sales. At some point, companies will be satisfied that they no longer have excess inventories and will raise production to match the current prevailing level of sales. This should deliver a quarter or two of growth. The question is what happens afterwards.China returning to strong growth mode and avoiding a meltdown of its own is a necessary condition for a global upturn, but not a sufficient one. With Europe and Japan in rapid decline, it will probably take a homegrown US recovery to produce an early global turnabout. This is remarkable, considering the US was the epicentre of the crisis, and in all past cases such countries have exported their way back to growth.It is possible to sketch out what might power a US recovery. The brutal contraction in the home construction industry is abating (even if home prices are still declining), taking away a big drag on growth. An end to economic freefall could unleash pent-up demand in sectors such as autos, where sales are running below the level required to maintain the current stock of vehicles. Moreover, there is tremendous fiscal and monetary stimulus in the pipeline.US consumer spending returned to growth at an annualised rate of 2.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year, after falling at about 4 per cent annualised in each of the preceding two quarters. If this can be sustained, the prospects for global recovery look good.However, Sheryl King, an economist at Merrill Lynch, fears “it is a one-quarter wonder”. Higher spending was underpinned by one-off increases in social security payments and decreases in personal taxes that boosted disposable income even as earned income fell as a result of huge job losses.Looking ahead, even with further aid from stimulus tax breaks and transfers such as benefit payments, unless the US jobs market improves sharply it is hard to see where consumers will find the money to support significant increases in spending.Moreover, the US savings rate – currently 4.2 per cent – could rise a lot further if households try to repair lost wealth. This is very hard to predict. To restore their net worth as of mid-2007, they would have to save or gain through capital appreciation $12,885bn (€9,674bn, £8,661bn). But to restore their net worth as of end-2005 would require only half that – $6,621bn. The time-frame over which they might try to restore lost wealth is highly uncertain, as is the share that might come from further rebounds in stock prices.Tight credit could suppress any rebound in spending, furthermore. “We will not have a sustainable recovery without a stabilisation of our financial system and credit markets,” Mr Bernanke said in a speech last month. But he added: “We are making progress on that front.”Equities have bounced about 30 per cent in the FTSE All-World index from their lows and some indicators of credit market stress have eased, partly in response to policy interventions, though shares are still lower than on January 1 and indicators of credit market stress remain at high levels.Mr Bernanke believes fixing the fi­nancial system is the key to recovery, as it would end the “feedback loop” between the shrinking economy and the damaged financial sector and replace it with a virtuous circle of more credit, higher asset prices and more growth. But some policymakers worry that, while a financial fix is necessary, it might not be enough to fuel decent growth. Households with damaged balance sheets may not respond vigorously even to a dramatic easing in the supply and price of credit.Certainly, the path of US consumer spending remains deeply uncertain. It is quite possible that everything will fall into place, and a financial fix, cheaper credit, higher stock prices, better job market conditions, improving confidence and sustained spending will reinforce each other in the US and globally. If so, the green shoots will flourish and the US – with China – could lead the world out of recession and into sustained recovery starting this year.But it is also possible the green shoots will wither with contraction or stagnation in US private demand, certainly if there is a further financial relapse, perhaps even if there is financial repair.If that is the case, the US could find itself in a situation loosely analogous to that of Japan in the mid-1990s – not collapsing, but unable to power a sustained strong recovery and requiring a repeat fiscal stimulus. Genuine world recovery would then come only when an adequate replacement source of global demand, possibly in some combination of Asia and continental Europe, arose – which could take many years.What is undeniable, though, is that for the first time in many months there are now some upside risks to the global economic outlook as well as many remaining downside risks.FOUR AREAS WHERE GREEN SHOOTS COULD SPROUT:US housingWith US mortgage rates at record lows and national home prices down more than 30 per cent from their 2005 peak, there are hopes that the seeds of a housing market recovery may soon sprout, writes Saskia Scholtes. In some of the hardest-hit markets, bargain hunters have begun to emerge. In California, such buyers have helped spur 80 per cent jumps in sales in both February and March.National sales of existing and new homes in February rose by 5.1 per cent and 4.7 per cent respectively, while housing starts and permits were also higher. Those figures fell once more in March, but at a more modest pace than in previous months, suggesting that activity may be at or near a bottom.Prices, however, have continued their relentless decline. The S&P Case Shiller house price index of the 20 biggest US cities has fallen for 30 consecutive months. February was the first time since October 2007 that the index did not report record annual price drops.Foreclosures make up about half of sales in the boom-and-bust states such as California and Florida. This means that while sales rise, prices continue to fall as more distressed inventory comes to market. “Foreclosures have crowded out voluntary sales, but they have helped total sales find a bottom,” says Michelle Meyer of Barclays Capital, adding that deep discounts and low mortgage rates were attracting buyers.A recovery in housing will be slow and feeble, however. Economists point to a large overhang of new and existing homes for sale, as well as a large pent-up inventory of homes waiting for more price stability. As prices lag behind demand, analysts expect further price falls until a bottoming out in the second half of 2010. Sustained recovery will come only when government breaks the “negative feedback loops of unemployment and the credit crunch,” says Ms Meyer.US retailWal-Mart, the largest US retailer, noted last week a recent shift in American shopping patterns, writes Jonathan Birchall.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of the company’s US stores, said lower payroll taxes – due to government stimulus efforts – and cheaper fuel meant sales growth had become less dependent on low-cost groceries and other basics. “People are using that money to buy some of the discretionary items that they were not buying before.”Elsewhere anecdotal evidence also suggests that the steep declines in discretionary spending seen in the fourth quarter have moderated, although overall spending remains soft. Muhtar Kent, chief executive of Coca-Cola, suggested that lower fuel prices might be supporting sales in fast food restaurants. JC Penney, a mid-priced US department store and useful barometer of Main Street sentiment, has also twice raised its earnings guidance, on stronger than expected but still declining sales. “I would not say we are more optimistic, but we are comforted that it is more predictable,” says Mike Ullman. The retailer still expects compar- able sales to be down 10 per cent this year, and has cut back inventories.Mall spending is forecast to see combined comparable sales for March and April down around 1 per cent, while sales in May could be flat or slightly up, according to the International Council of Shopping Centres.Some sectors remain hard hit. Luxury retailers Saks and Neiman Marcus have continued to report annualised monthly declines of 20 per cent or more in comparable sales. Frank Blake, chief executive of Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, says that markets that were hit hard early, such as California, are no longer the worst. “It’s not like it’s good. It’s just less bad,” says Mr Blake.Financial marketsWorld equity markets have rallied sharply since early March, with key indices up more than 30 per cent, writes Aline Van Duyn.Over the same period, many of the indicators that signalled enormous levels of distress in the world’s financial system have also improved. It is clear that financial markets are no longer pricing in a complete collapse in the global economy.Measures of stress in the banking system, such as the interest rates charged among banks, have fallen sharply in recent weeks. The widely watched London interbank offered rate (Libor) has fallen to its lowest this year. However, most bank stress indicators remain high relative to historic levels, or to where they stood before the devastating bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers last September.“The recession is ending around now, and the stock market is anticipating this,” says Larry Kantor of Barclays Capital, who switched to a bullish stance on equities in March. “Credit markets have not gained as much, but are heading in the same direction.”The costs of borrowing have even fallen significantly for risky companies – those with such high levels of debt that a default is possible if earnings decrease or if it is difficult to refinance debt that comes due. Some of these have also been able to borrow new debt, at least in the US market. In Europe, investor demand is more limited.Despite the positive signs, there are still concerns that stresses in the banking system and the closure of large sources of funding, such as the securitised debt markets, could again hurt fragile investor confidence.Goldman Sachs notes that funding prospects “remain very challenging”. New bond issues remain heavily skewed toward high-quality credits, and we anticipate only a very slow improvement in this pattern over the next year.ChinaPerhaps more than any major economy, China is showing signs of improvement, writes Geoff Dyer. Indicators suggest that the economy began to recover in March with industrial production rising 8.3 per cent from 2.8 per cent in January-February.The official figure for first-quarter growth of 6.1 per cent fell from 6.8 per cent in the fourth quarter. Independent estimates, however, suggest sequential growth picked up from 1-2 per cent in the fourth quarter to about 5 per cent in the first quarter. Economists are revising growth forecasts upwards again. Qing Wang of Morgan Stanley says there was a “sharp sequential rebound” in March and has lifted his 2009 forecast from 5.5 per cent to 7 per cent.Beijing has strong-armed banks into extending Rmb4560bn ($660bn, €498bn, £444bn) in loans in the first three months of the year – more than all new bank lending in 2008. This has backed state infrastructure spending – the Dragonomics consultancy estimates the rate of increase in fixed asset investment doubled in the first quarter to 31.4 per cent.A sustainable recovery will require private investment and consumption. However industrial profits margins have plunged in recent months, which bodes ill for capital spending. Job cuts in factories and reduced salaries for many others are likely to drag on consumer demand for months. More aggressive measures to boost consumption, such as big rises in healthcare spending or income tax cuts, are being called for.The current account surplus remains huge, raising fears that the economy has yet to undergo the rebalancing occurring in the US and elsewhere. The trade surplus could shrink this year as the investment-led recovery pulls in more imports. However, the surplus could also indicate a larger over-capacity that has yet to be absorbed."
247;HD;Home Depot;2009-04-23T18:50:21Z;A deal to organise;;"The Cintas commercial laundry in Islip, on New York’s Long Island, stands in a typical modern American landscape – a neat brick building in a nondescript business park adjacent to a shopping mall, with neighbours including a database analysis company and a manufacturer of bathroom fittings.Only the small signs in the parking lot, warning against “trespass, solicitation, or distribution of literature”, indicate that Cintas, a business services company, is also the focus of a big national organising effort launched six years ago by the Unite Here union.“I want to be in a union because a union would bring us many benefits and a sense of security, where my voice counts,” says Adela Viera, one of the laundry’s workers, speaking in Spanish during an interview at a nearby Starbucks. Ms Viera earns about $9.80 (£6.70, €7.50) an hour after working at the Islip laundry for almost 12 years.She and her fellow workers – washing and folding uniforms in pursuit of the American Dream – could also be in the vanguard of a revival of the US labour movement, if new efforts in Congress to strengthen the ability of unions to organise become law. “Getting a reform of labour law, restoring workers’ rights to organise, is essential for the country, the economy and the labour movement,” says Bruce Raynor, general president of Unite Here.Unionisation has been falling since the 1940s, in line with the decline in traditional manufacturing industries. Only one in eight of the workforce is these days a member; in the private sector it is one in 12. But trade unions spent hundreds of millions of dollars to support Democrats at last year’s elections and, with their party now controlling Congress and the White House, they see it as payback time.Mr Raynor argues that reforms envisaged by a labour bill before Congress, relaxing constraints on a union’s ability to secure recognition in a workplace, would lead to an “explosive growth” in union membership among workers such as Ms Viera in the service sector, as well as in manufacturing, distribution and retailing. If it is passed, unions and big business agree, the change would be the most substantial since 1947, when the 1935 Depression-era labour relations act was amended for the postwar environment.But employers are arguing that US business cannot afford to deal with union demands at a time of economic crisis – an argument that has found some traction with wavering congressional Democrats (see below).Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat from Wal-Mart’s home state of Arkansas and a previous supporter of the bill, said this month that now was not the time to pass it. “Now that we need all hands on deck, including business and labour, to get our economy moving again, this issue is dividing us,” she added.Amid the recession, unions even in the most strongly organised sectors find themselves under greater than usual pressure. One test will come at General Motors, the beleaguered carmaker, whose unions are being asked to accept reduced benefits.Yet the debate also comes at a time when public anger at the excesses of corporate America is prompting wider sympathy for trade unions. Employers in less unionised industries are therefore nervous about the implications.The proposed legislation – dubbed the Employee Free Choice Act by its supporters – would remove employers’ right to demand a secret ballot supervised by the National Labor Relations Board. Instead, it would require recognition of a union if more than half the workers have signed union cards. Orrin Hatch, a Republican senator from Utah, told a meeting of Efca opponents at the US chamber of Commerce this month the measure “should be called the Employee Coercion Act of 2009”.Employers say the secret ballot is vital to stop union organisers pressuring workers to sign up. “Workers won’t decide. Union organisers will decide,” says Richard Hankins, a lawyer at McKenna Long & Aldridge, who represents businesses on labour issues. “That does concern a lot of people.”For their part, the unions say employers can use the period between calling the ballot to browbeat workers with compulsory education sessions and intimidatory tactics. Mr Raynor argues that in general, “no unions use the current system in the US any more …because it doesn’t work”.The UFCW grocery workers union, for example, abandoned efforts to organise at Wal-Mart, the largest US private employer, in 2003. Instead, it has conducted a broad political campaign against the retailer, highlighting its low-wage model and challenging its healthcare benefits.The UFCW also points to its effort to represent a group of 10 Wal-Mart meat workers in Texas who voted to unionise in 2000. Wal-Mart subsequently closed its store meat-cutting counters. Last year – nine years after the vote – a federal appeals court upheld an NLRB ruling that Wal-Mart should start to negotiate with the union on behalf of the former meat cutters. “If ever there was a case that demonstrated how utterly bankrupt the current system is, the Jacksonville Wal-Mart case is it,” says the union.The bill would also increase the penalties for dismissing employees for engaging in union activity – currently, violators are required only to provide back pay, with no punitive damages. “[Even] when they are punished by fines, they know they can make more money. But unfortunately management can use my experience to put more pressure and harassment on my co-workers,” says Evangelina Orozco, a Unite supporter who eventually received $29,000 in back pay from Cintas after being dismissed in 2005.At Cintas, Unite Here and the Teamsters are trying to organise about 17,000 of the group’s 34,000 employees in a bitter battle that switches between the lunch rooms and parking lots of its laundries and the hearing rooms of the NLRB and the court system.In January, the NLRB ruled in favour of the union complaints, accusing Cintas of restricting workers’ rights to organise at two laundries. The board required the employer to post notices advising workers of their rights. On the other side, a federal court last year ordered the union to pay at least $5m in damages to Cintas workers whose car number plates were photographed in 2004 by organisers who wanted to use the data to get the home addresses of workers.The struggle has been intensified by the death of a Cintas worker in 2007 who was dragged into an industrial dryer at a laundry in Tulsa. The company agreed in December to pay $2.76m in damages and to add safety features to its plants. The union argues that proper worker representation would have dealt with the threat before the death happened.Cintas, which has unsuccessfully tried to sue the union under racketeering laws, says it abides by NLRB regulations. It also insists that it is not anti-union and that it respects “our partners’ rights to choose what is best for them and their families”.Not surprisingly, the company is an active opponent of Efca. Other large employers including Wal-Mart and Home Depot have been organising efforts to bring pressure to bear on local members of Congress.Although President Barack Obama – a co-sponsor of a card check bill as a senator in 2007 – has voiced support for the legislation since his election, he has not spent time on the issue. Suspicions remain that he would prefer the bill to be killed in Congress so as not to be faced with signing legislation that business leaders argue would kill jobs amid a fierce recession.Given the diverse support he attracted during the campaign, Mr Obama may ultimately be less dependent on the unions than previous Democrat presidents. “He’s the first Democratic candidate who has not relied on the turnout mechanism of organised labour,” notes a business lobbyist. “He comes in probably more ideologically aligned with organised labour, but owing them less.”Whatever the final fate of Efca’s card count recognition clause, the labour movement can still expect to see benefits from the Obama presidency: Hilda Solis, the new labour secretary, is regarded as an ally. This month, her department speeded up regulations designed to prevent a lung disease thought to be caused in popcorn manufacture. A campaigning issue for unions, the step had been held up by the previous administration.The card check battle could end with a compromise that includes the tougher penalties for anti-union intimidation and compulsory arbitration for the first contract negotiated between an employer and a new union.So for would-be unionists at the Cintas laundry and across the country, there is still the prospect of a rebalancing of labour laws. For employers scared of a pro-union administration, the apprehension lingers on.DEMOCRATIC DIVISIONS: ‘CARD CHECK’ BECOMES A REALITY CHECK IN A WARY CONGRESSThe election of President Barack Obama and the increased numbers of Democrats in Congress gave hope to trade unions that some of their most sought-after measures might become reality, writes Tom Braithwaite.After eight years in which the National Labor Relations Board exerted a pro-business stance under the administration of George W. Bush, an Employee Free Choice Act to make unionisation easier remains top of activists’ wish-list.But three months after Mr Obama’s inauguration, prospects for the law have faded even though Democrats, backed by hundreds of millions of union dollars, are under pressure to push forward with a union-friendly agenda.“We have the president on our side,” says Richard Trumka, secretary treasurer of the AFL-CIO union coalition. True, Mr Obama has backed publicly the so-called “card check” legislation – requiring a union to be recognised if more than half the workers have signed union cards – and as a senator he supported a previous version of the bill in 2007. But the suspicion remains that the administration, like some Democrats in Congress, would prefer that the bill went away as the country grappled with the recession.Since the legislation was introduced last month, both unions and employers – led by the US Chamber of Commerce – took up arms on what Arlen Specter, a centrist Republican senator, called the “most heavily lobbied issue I can recall”.Wearied by calls to back the law and under pressure from his own party, Mr Specter decided he could not vote in favour and mooted a weaker compromise. His decision dealt a potentially fatal blow to the legislation.Even if all the Senate’s Democrats vote in favour, they need one Republican to join them to reach the 60 votes necessary for it to pass. Though risking union wrath, not all Democrats will. Last week, newspapers in neighbouring Kansas and Colorado took aim, coincidentally, at the unwillingness of local senators to state their position.To come out against card check in its current form – the stance of Blanche Lincoln, a senator for Wal-Mart’s home state of Arkansas, and Dianne Feinstein, senator for California – is a risk for most Democrats, so important is the unions’ financial fire-power and ability to get out the vote.But either way, centrist Democrats tread a delicate path, such is the opposition to the bill from business groups and the difficulty of assessing the public’s view. The AFL-CIO points to a poll that shows 73 per cent of Americans are in favour of card check but other polls are less stark or turn the other way.“The biggest challenge in polling on an issue like Efca is that so few Americans are aware of the actual bill or the conflicts between organised labour and management,” writes Mark Blumenthal, editor of Pollster.com, on his poll analysis website. He points to a Gallup poll that shows 53 per cent of respondents in favour of a law making it easier to organise workers. But the polling organisation acknowledges that an “exceptionally low” number say they are following the issue closely.If card check fails, there is likely to be a day of reckoning for Democrats whose support wavered. The price of continued union backing is likely to be some sort of compromise measure as well as the formation of a more liberal National Labor Relations Board and pro-union executive orders from Mr Obama, which would not have to navigate a doubtful Senate.“It’s premature to pop the Champagne corks,” says Steven Law, chief legal officer of the Chamber of Commerce. On the other side, unions are hoping their own celebration is not on ice for too long."
248;HD;Home Depot;2009-04-14T20:59:38Z;US stocks fall despite Goldman results;;"US stocks fell on Tuesday as much better than expected results from Goldman Sachs were offset by negative economic data.Financials were the biggest fallers even though Goldman helped return some confidence to the sector by far outstripping analysts’ estimates with its first-quarter earnings.Goldman announced it had made $3.39 a share against expectations of just $1.49 a share on the back of strong trading figures.But the bank’s shares fell as it also announced it was to raise $5bn of capital by issuing new shares in order to repay money from the Troubled Asset Relief Programme (Tarp).This would dilute existing shareholdings, and its shares dropped 11.6 per cent to $115.11. Rival Morgan Stanley, which is forecast to make a loss when it reports, fell 12 per cent to $23.67.“It’s no surprise that Goldman was profitable, when they can borrow at zero per cent from the Federal Reserve. The real question is whether it has to make
writedowns later in the year,” said Andrew Mulligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments.However, the positive underlying results did help boost Citigroup, the most beaten-up of all the major banking stocks. Citi leapt 25 per cent during Monday’s session and added 5.5 per cent on Tuesday to $4.01.Financial shares in general were badly hit by figures which showed retail sales unexpectedly fell during March, losing 0.9 per cent, excluding sales of automobiles.Meanwhile, the falling oil price helped drive down ­producer prices in March, contrary to analysts’ ­expectations, following two successive months of gains.Discover dropped after it said that it would cut more than 4 per cent of its workforce as it strives to cut costs. The credit card lender also suffered from a downgrade to “hold” by Stifel Nicolaus, and its shares had lost 10.4 per cent to $7.57.MetLife, the life insurer, also fell, despite saying it would not take federal bail-out funds, even though it is entitled to by the fact that it purchased a bank in 2001.Robert Henrikson, its chief executive, said MetLife was “well positioned, with approximately $5bn in excess capital”. But its shares became caught in the broad sell-off, falling 8.2 per cent to $26.44.Retailers also suffered. after the data. Home Depot lost 2.4 per cent to $25.34, while Macy’s dropped 7.3 per cent to $11.99 and Best Buy fell 6.9 per cent to $38.10.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2 per cent down at 841.51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7 per cent to 7,920.18 points and the Nasdaq Composite index had dropped 1.7 per cent to 1,625.72 points.“Analysts are being too optimistic with their predictions on what really matters, such as how much people are spending in stores,” said Andrew Wilkinson of Interactive Brokers. “This is a really big disappointment, and one that is going to challenge the rally going forward.”The falls came despite positive comments on the economy from President Barack Obama and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr Obama said he saw “signs of economic progress”. But stocks extended their slide after he finished speaking, with investors apparently having hoped for more from what was billed as a “major speech on the economy”.Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare group, followed Goldman Sachs in topping analysts’ expectations with its first-quarter earnings. The company said revenues were down, but it managed to keep costs low and reported earnings of $1.26 per share, against consensus estimates of $1.22. Its shares gained 0.4 per cent to $51.37.Lennar, the homebuilder, dropped after Moody’s downgraded its debt, citing concerns about the company’s liquidity position. Its shares lost 5.4 per cent to $7.78.MGM Mirage saw some rare positive news after it won a waiver from lenders to pay about $70m of obligations owed by both itself and its building partner Dubai World, which would allow it to continue to build its CityCenter development in Las Vegas. Its shares gained 5.6 per cent to $6.60.General Motors was another riser after reports that the ­government was considering swapping $13.4bn debt for equity in a new, stripped-down version of the ­carmaker. Its shares gained 4.1 per cent to $1.78."
249;HD;Home Depot;2009-03-17T20:01:00Z;Wall Street boosted by strong housing data;;"US stocks staged a financials-led rally on Tuesday on housing data that was much better than expected.Figures showing that building had started on many more houses than expected during February gave equities the spur to continue the rising trend of last week.Citigroup continued its gains, rising 7.7 per cent to $2.51 and JPMorgan added 8.9 per cent to $25.14.Builders KB Home and Lennar rose 9.3 per cent to $11.12 and 8.7 per cent to $8.52 respectively.Producer prices also managed to edge upwards, by 0.1 per cent, allaying fears of deflation and further bolstering consumer companies.The retail sector as a whole also benefited from an upgrade by Jefferies International for seven companies, including Home Depot and Lowe’s, which rose 6.7 per cent to $21.48 and 6.2 per cent to $16.42 respectively.Even American Express found some gains in spite of reporting on Monday that higher numbers of people had trouble paying their credit card bills in February. Its shares rose 1.9 per cent to $12.91.“Delinquency rates will rise with unemployment, but I don’t think losses from the credit card sector is the next big surprise for the market,” said Bruce Harting, at Barclays Capital.The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 3.2 per cent to 778.12 points.The Nasdaq Composite index performed better, gaining 4.1 per cent to 1,462.11 points as technology stocks rose, having been heavily sold during the previous
session.Cisco, which on Monday announced it was to make servers for data systems, was named a “conviction buy” by Goldman Sachs.Its shares rose 4.5 per cent to $16.14.Dell also gained after saying it would launch an ultra-thin notebook computer this month to compete with Apple and Hewlett-Packard. Dell’s shares picked up 4.9 per cent to $9.34.Apple rose 4.4 per cent to $99.66 after it announced the third version of its iPhone.The rise came in spite of research group NPD saying that the company had sold 16 per cent fewer Apple Mac computers in February than in January.The news on the iPhone helped AT&T, the only network available with that model, rise 4.2 per cent to $25.37. Verizon also gained, picking up 4.5 per cent to $29.83.The Dow Jones Industrial index made smaller gains, weighed down by two of the country’s biggest metal producers as falling demand continued to take its toll. The index closed 2.5 per cent up at 7,395.70 points.Alcoa’s shares dropped after the aluminium producer said it would cut its dividend from $0.17 to $0.03, issue stock and convertible notes and trim its 2010 spending in an effort to weather weak demand.The shares fell on Monday night and continued to lose ground on Tuesday, dropping 8.7 per cent to $5.59.There was similar bad news from the steel sector, as Nucor, the country’s largest steel manufacturer, forecast a first quarter loss that was worse than expected. Dan DiMicco, chief executive, said there was “no visibility as to the timing of the [economic] recovery”. The shares fell 9.2 per cent to $33.55.Nucor was joined by other big names in steel making, including AK Steel, which fell 1.8 per cent to $6.04, and US Steel, losing 3.2 per cent to $17.81. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, also fell, dropping 0.9 per cent to $36.93.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said: “The move by Alcoa to issue shares and cut its dividend is a sign that commodity demand is weak despite excitement over Chinese buying and hopes for an economic recovery in Asia.”Energy stocks rose as the price of crude oil picked up. Chevron gained 3.8 per cent to $65.31 and Exxon Mobil rose 3.2 per cent to $69.09.Pfizer launched a $13.5bn debt sale to fund its purchase of fellow drugmaker Wyeth. Its shares rose 0.8 per cent to $14.26.The Federal Reserve is due to announce on Wednesday whether it is willing to purchase assets on a large scale.Joe Balestrino, fixed income strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Such a step may act to further soothe credit markets already calmed somewhat by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke.”"
250;HD;Home Depot;2009-03-16T22:34:31Z;Home Depot targets customer service;;Home Depot has been at the front line of a deteriorating US economy for more than two years now, with store sales and traffic falling as Americans cut back on home renovation projects.But while its customers are spending less, Home Depot has been spending more on serving them.Last year, it channelled another $250m into funding more staff working hours at its 1,950-plus US stores. Since early 2007, it has hired more than 3,000 licensed plumbers and electricians to provide customers and staff with expert advice. And it is currently investing in new training programmes for store staff, in what it calls “the fundamentals of customer service”.But Home Depot has not been exempt from the need to cut costs as the economy has deteriorated, and it has drastically slowed its new store opening plans. Only six or so new stores are expected to open in the US this year.In January, it announced about 2,000 job cuts in store support services, although not in customer-facing positions, largely by shifting administrative jobs from store level to its district and divisional management. Job reductions also came from a decision to integrate its previously free-standing home services installation unit into store operations.At the same time, it announced the closure of its Expo business – 48 stores focused on high-end home improvement sales, design and installation – with the loss of a further 5,000 jobs. The retailer argued that Expo, launched in 1992, was not a strong business even during the housing boom, although it had sales of almost $1bn annually.Overall, the cuts resulted in about $153m in store closure and staff severance costs, but they were broadly welcomed by analysts.Colin McGranahan, retail analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the cuts were “another positive sign that the company is taking the downturn seriously and managing its business accordingly”.The cuts reflect a broader restructuring strategy at the chain since the beginning of 2007, when Frank Blake took over as chief executive at a time of shareholder dissatisfaction over the retailer’s core US store business.By August 2007, the retailer had sold off the wholesale supply business that Bob Nardelli, Mr Blake’s predecessor, had built up to offset slowing store growth. As the housing market worsened further in 2008, it closed 15 underperforming stores, pulled back on planned new store openings, and cut more than 1,000 jobs by moving human resource functions out of the stores to district level.“They’ve really been very aggressive, they are really cleaning house,” Deborah Weinswig, a retail analyst at Citi Investment Research, says.But as the company tried to improve customer satisfaction – where it had been losing ground to rival Lowe’s – Home Depot increased spending on store maintenance. It also directed more money into a staff incentive scheme.Not all current spending is being targeted at the front of the store, however. Behind the scenes, the retailer is expanding a network of new distribution centres, called Rapid Deployment Centers, which are aimed at aggregating orders from stores and reducing direct-to-store shipments by vendors. The retailer says the move will reduce transport costs, while improving inventory turnover, which in turn improves free cash flow.Howard Martin, head of global consumer products at Ernst & Young, argues that such structural shifts are likely to characterise the companies that emerge from the downturn in a stronger position than previously.“You can’t just cut costs to succeed. Just doing the day-to-day cost-cutting is a major contribution, but it won’t give you the answers the success stories will be based on,” he says.Home Depot says it is bracing for another tough year, although it noted last month it had gained some market share from Lowe’s. Mr Blake seems to be holding to his view, expressed 16 months ago, that some of the decisions forced by the economic downturn could help make Home Depot into a stronger retailer.“This downturn is an opportunity …to focus our resources and attention on the things that matter, and to bring greater customer focus to the business,” he says.
251;HD;Home Depot;2009-03-12T18:03:13Z;Wal-Mart looks to Hispanic market;;Wal-Mart plans to open its first Hispanic-focused supermarkets this summer in Arizona and Texas as the largest US retailer continues its drive to expand its dominance of the US grocery business.The pilot stores, named Supermercado de Walmart, will open in Phoenix and Houston in remodelled 39,000 sq ft locations occupied previously by two of Wal-Mart’s Neighborhood Market stores.The retailer said that the stores were in “strongly Hispanic neighbourhoods” and would feature a “new lay-out, signing and product assortment designed to make them even more relevant to local Hispanic customers”. The staff will also be bilingual.Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club warehouse store also plans to open a 143,000 sq ft Hispanic-focused store called Más Club in Houston this year.Several leading regional US supermarket chains already operate Hispanic store brands, including Publix in Florida, which operates three Publix Sabor markets, and HEB in Texas, which opened a Mi Tienda store in Houston in 2006.The markets include elements such as cafés serving Latino pastries and coffee, and full service meat and fish counters.Leading retailers are also pursuing Hispanic consumers online, with Best Buy and Home Depot having launched Spanish-language versions of their e-commerce sites in recent months.Eduardo Castro-Wright, the head of Wal-Mart’s US stores since 2005, has also been an advocate of testing new smaller, more focused formats, and raised the idea of turning the Neighbourhood Market into a Hispanic-style bodega concept several years ago.He has also developed Wal-Mart’s efforts to customise its larger Supercenter stores, which have been grouped according to differing community profiles, such as urban, suburban, Hispanic and African-American, with customised merchandise.A 195,000 sq ft Supercenter that opened in Texas last year included a tortilleria bakery, Hispanic foods and a larger selection of Spanish-language music and DVDs.Mr Castro-Wright was previously head of Wal-Mart’s Mexican subsidiary, whose store network ranges from large US-style Supercenters to small local bodegas, an upmarket supermarket chain and two restaurant chains.Last year, Wal-Mart also began testing four new 10,000 sq ft Marketside convenience grocery stores in the Phoenix area – its first new format in a decade. Tesco, the UK retailer, also has more than 25 of its small Fresh & Easy markets in the Phoenix area.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.3 per cent at 7,350.94.“Just how sustainable any rally will be however remains to be seen – there’s no end of negative sentiment at play right now,” said Ian Griffiths, dealer at CMC
Markets.“We keep revisiting just how much value can be taken out of the market,
but the fact that the S&P had closed below 750 for the first time in almost 12 years certainly suggests that there’s plenty of life left in the bears for now.”The stock market gains came in spite of new data showing that US consumer confidence plunged to a record low in February and the housing market continues to stagger.Mr Bernanke gave stock market investors some confidence when he said in prepared remarks to the Senate Banking Committee that the recession should end this year.Weakness in material, industrial and technology shares had, in the previous session, pushed the S&P beneath a nadir reached in November last year.Continuing worries about the long-term future of the financial sector were shrugged off and the sector as a whole rallied strongly.JPMorgan shares rose by 7.7 per cent to $21.02, saying that the first-quarter so far had been “solidly profitable”. The bank, which appears to have avoided the most severe difficulties of its peers, also disclosed that it would cut its dividend by 87 per cent in a move to preserve capital.Citigroup and Bank of America, which found positive territory in the previous session in spite of the gloom elsewhere, were up 21.5 per cent $2.60 and 21 per cent to $4.73, respectively.American International Group is seeking an overhaul of its $150bn government bail-out package that would substantially reduce the insurer’s financial burden, while further exposing US taxpayers to its fortunes, according to reports.AIG is widely expected to post a loss of more than $60bn for its fourth quarter. Shares were down almost 23 per cent to 41 cents.Meanwhile, Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer said that the company would continue to face tough conditions in all of its businesses in the second half of its fiscal year. But he added that the software company is not planning deeper cuts to operating expenses. Microsoft shares fell 0.2 per cent to $17.17.Third-quarter net income at HJ Heinz rose 11 per cent as the food company benefited from higher prices for its products and as some of its brands did well in a weak economy. Its shares rose 5.6 per cent to $33.80.Consumer stocks received a boost from better-than-expected earnings from Home Depot.Shares in the home improvement retailer rallied 10.5 per cent to $20.67.Target and Macy’s said their fourth-quarter earnings fell sharply as shoppers cut back on purchases, while Office Depotposted a loss for the quarter.Target shares lost 2.1 per cent to close at $27.83 while Macy’s rose 12 per cent, to $8.29 and Office Depot shares fell 13.1 per cent to $1.26.RadioShack sank 24.4 per cent to $8.18 after the electronics retailer disclosed a steep decline in fourth-quarter earnings that was significantly worse than expected.In spite of Tuesday’s broad rally, the mood on Wall Street remains extremely tense.Analysts at Monument Securities said the feeling was growing that the world political leadership did not measure up to the scale of the challenge facing it.“The defining mark of an economic depression is that policy-moves are not effective in ending it.“The markets’ increasing sense of frustration at the inability of policymakers to put matters right is an element in their growing conviction that the world economy is entering a depression.”"
253;HD;Home Depot;2009-02-24T18:27:43Z;Gap widens between US retailers;;"Five leading US retailers offered a cross section look at the state of US consumption on Tuesday, and underlined the growing gap between the sector’s strongest and weakest store chains.The worst news came from Office Depot, the office supplies retailer, which saw comparable sales fall 18 per cent at its 1,200 North American stores.It said it would need to boost liquidity following a drop in demand from retail and small business customers, and said it would close 118 US stores in the coming year.Its shares fell almost 20 per cent on the news.RadioShack, the consumer electronics retailer, reported that net sales fell 7.7 per cent in the holiday quarter, sending shares down almost 20 per cent on Tuesday.RadioShack has been facing growing competition in its core mobile phone business.However, Home Depot, Target and Macy’s expressed broad satisfaction with their performance, despite reporting steep falls in earnings amid the worst slump in retail sales for decades.The challenges facing retailers were underlined by consumer confidence figures from the Conference Board reaching new lows for February.Looking ahead, Carol Tome, chief financial officer of Home Depot, said the company was expecting the country’s GDP to contract by 2.5 per cent in the first half of the year, and by 1.1 per cent in the latter half, leading it to a “working estimate” of a 9 per cent fall in its sales over 2009.“It has really come down to what is happening in the overall economy; you can’t just look at one metric,” she said.The estimate excludes any possible benefits from the US federal stimulus package, which includes a broad range of initiatives that are aimed both at increasing employment and at supporting other goals such as energy efficiency that might support home improvement sales.“We are trying to digest the stimulus package, just like everyone else,” Ms Tome said.Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive of Target, said the discounter expected sales of home furnishings and clothing to remain weak in the coming quarter, with continued growth “in the upper mid-single” digits in its low-cost food and healthcare categories.Target said it had cleaned out excess inventory left after retail demand collapsed in September and October. “We feel pretty good that we’ve got the sales and the receipts matched up appropriately as we look forward into 2009.”"
254;HD;Home Depot;2009-02-24T13:52:27Z;Home Depot warns of tough year ahead;;Home Depot, the US home improvements retailer, saw its shares rise over 5 per cent on Tuesday, as it reported better than expected fourth-quarter earnings that included a $602m charge related to closing several businesses and cutting jobs.The Atlanta-based company lost $54m, or 3 cents a share, during the final three months of 2008, compared with profits of $671m, or 40 cents a share, during the same period the year before.Excluding the one-time charges, its earnings fell to 19 cents a share, down 52.5 per cent from the previous year, but ahead of Wall Street’s expectations of 15 cents a share.”Despite the difficult economic conditions, the company made important progress in key areas,” said Frank Blake, Home Depot’s chief executive, referring to inventory reductions, a campaign to lower prices and improved customer service ratings.Sales at Home Depot slowed in the fourth quarter, declining by 17.3 per cent to $14.6bn. Comparable-store sales also declined, falling by 13 per cent. Both were affected by a calendar shift leaving the quarter with one fewer week than in the previous year and customers cutting back on home renovations amid declining home values.Meanwhile, Home Depot’s projections for 2009 were below analysts’ expectations. It estimates that the company’s earnings will decline by 7 per cent and that sales will fall by 9 per cent. It said that comparable-store sales would also slide.”We expect the home improvement market in 2009 will remain just as challenging as 2008, but we will continue to invest in our associates and stores to set a strong foundation for the long term health of our company,” Mr Blake said.Last month Home Depot announced that it would cut 7,000 jobs, with 5,000 resulting from the decision to close around loss-making 40 home project planning stores, and 2,000 coming from administrative staff reductions. The cuts amounted to about 2 per cent of its workforce.Rival Lowe’s, the second-largest US home improvement retailer with more than 1,600 stores, said it was expecting another year of falling comparable sales of 4-8 per cent, after a 7.2 per cent fall in its 2008 fiscal year. Its earnings fell 60 per cent to $160m, or 11 cents per share, on a 3.8 per cent fall in revenues to $10bn.
255;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;US retail sales show surprise rise;;US retail sales in January rose for the first time in six months, as consumers were lured by deep post-holiday discounts in spite of growing job cuts and declining home values.January retail sales were up 1 per cent from the month before, according to figures released on Thursday by the commerce department, breaking a record stretch of six months of declines. Sales were off by 9.7 per cent compared with the previous January, however.The jump surprised economists. Most forecasters predicted a monthly fall of about 0.8 per cent after sales dropped by a revised 3 per cent from November to December. In December retail sales were off by a revised 10.5 per cent compared with the year before, the sharpest such fall since record-keeping began in 1992.“Plainly consumers were to some extent willing to pick up extreme post-Christmas bargains,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.Wall Street took little comfort from the results on Thursday after analysts warned that they appeared to be skewed by seasonal swings.Retail stocks were among the losers as the wider market fell sharply in the first half hour of trading. By mid-morning in New York, the benchmark S&P 500 index was down 2 per cent at 817.10, leaving it little more than 1 per cent away from hitting a fresh low for the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2 per cent to 7,783.50 and the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1.4 per cent at 1,509.39. Tiffany, Macy’s and Home Depot all shed more than 3 per cent.Excluding the volatile market for automobiles, January retail sales rose by 0.9 per cent. Car dealers saw sales up by 1.8 per cent last month and sales at electronics and appliance stores increased by 2.6 per cent. Sales at petrol stations also rebounded, rising by 2.6 per cent after sinking by 15.6 per cent the month before.The data clashed with much of the anecdotal evidence and other statistics that have suggested that US consumers are retrenching. Some analysts said that the surprise rise was the result of sales falling so dramatically in the fourth quarter.“The results were totally inconsistent with company reports and we strongly suspect that seasonal distortions were responsible for much – if not all – of the upside surprise,” noted David Greenlaw and Ted Wieseman, economists at Morgan Stanley.After the toughest Christmas season in decades, US retailers last week reported grim January sales figures that underlined the intensity of their struggle for survival.Gap’s Old Navy stores delivered one of the worst performances, with comparable sales down by more than a third. Saks, the luxury department store, reported a 23 per cent drop, echoing the 24.4 per cent drop announced by Neiman Marcus.Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle, the youth fashion stores, also reported sales down by more than 20 per cent, while JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-range department stores, saw mid-teen percentage drops.Retailers have announced several thousand job cuts this year, including 1,100 at Saks and 7,000 at Macy’s. Most have also indicated that they are sharply reducing inventory levels. Last week the International Council of Shopping Centers reported that chain store sales fell by 1.6 per cent in January compared with the previous year.Companies have been working to reduce their inventories in expectation of continued weak demand. Business inventories in December fell 1.3 per cent from the month before and were up 0.9 per cent from the prior year. Sales dropped more than expected in December, resulting in an inventories-to-sales ratio of 1.44, the highest since 2001.“Looking ahead, aggressive moves to keep inventories under control will weigh on orders and production as the cyclical downturn persists,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Meanwhile, the number of US workers claiming unemployment benefits for the first time fell by a less than expected 8,000 to 623,000 for the week ending February 7, according to labour department figures. That follows a week when initial jobless claims reached a revised 631,000, a 26-year high.The four-week moving average for initial jobless claims rose to 607,500, the highest level since 1982 and total unemployment benefits rose for a fourth straight week to near the 5m mark.
256;HD;Home Depot;2009-02-04T17:39:52Z;Seed merchants benefit from urge to dig deep;;Americans are turning in increasing numbers to their back yards to save money, with leading US seed merchants reporting a dramatic surge in early sales of carrots, tomato and pepper plant seeds.George Ball, chairman of W. Atlee Burpee, which sells directly to gardeners and via retailers such as Home Depot, told the Financial Times that sales of vegetable seeds had grown 20-30 per cent this year.The increase, he said, follows a similar jump in sales last year, and compares with previous annual growth levels of about 12 per cent.Mr Ball said belt-tightening and economic concerns were the dominant factors driving demand, which had been stimulated last year by the high cost of petrol, and food safety concerns, following a scare over contaminated store-bought salad greens.“Not only has demand not returned to normal but it has wildly increased,” he said of the company’s latest sales numbers. “It is just like a bonanza.”Richard Chamberlain, president of Harris Seeds, which supplies both commercial growers and gardeners, estimated that sales of seeds to gardeners were up by 50 per cent this year, with the company seeing a surge in first-time customers on its website.“You’ll be seeing people digging over their lawns and planting vegetables,” he said.Burpee has responded to the frugal mood by marketing a $10 multi-pack of vegetable seeds dubbed the “Money Garden”, which includes seeds for tomatoes, peas, carrots, basil, peppers and sugar-snap peas.It also commissioned research to demonstrate that the seeds could theoretically produce the equivalent of $650 of store-bought vegetables.The boom in vegetable planting has already had a knock-on effect for other businesses. Ball’s, part of Jarden, the homewares conglomerate, says sales of its preserving jars and lids increased 40 per cent last year.A recent survey of 12,000 visitors to a Ball’s website on preserving techniques, www.freshpreserving.com, found that more than 70 per cent respondents intended to preserve more foods in an effort to save money on weekly groceries.Chris Scherzinger, head of marketing at Jarden Home Brands, said that the increase in sales continued a pattern seen during recessionary periods in the 1970s.”We find that in tough economic times, Ball jar sales numbers increase significantly. We are seeing this now due to the recent economy, “ he said.Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, also suggested last year that strong sales of freezers partly reflected increased freezing of garden produce.In an effort to catch the mood, Park Seeds, another leading seed company, is this year again selling a “Victory Garden” multi-seed pack, that also includes squash and beans, with its marketing recalling the victory gardens planted in the US and the UK during the second world war.Burpee’s marketing message for its Money Garden is more closely focused on the current crisis, saying that gardeners can “watch your assets grow before your eyes”.“Unlike any stock you ever bought, you can enjoy your returns sautéed, boiled, braised, broiled or served raw,” exclaims the blurb.
257;HD;Home Depot;2009-01-27T09:21:24Z;Gloom deepens as 76,000 jobs go in a day;;Corporate bellwethers in the US and Europe on Monday slashed more than 76,000 jobs from their payrolls to confront the deepening economic downturn, marking one of the most brutal days yet for workers on both sides of the Atlantic.US corporate groups such as Caterpillar, General Motors, Sprint Nextel. Texas Instruments, and Home Depot led the retreat, as the domestic recession coupled with tough export markets continued to take a heavy toll on their businesses. Pfizer, the drugs group, added to the tally saying jobs would be lost in its takeover of Wyeth.Large European companies such as Philips, the Dutch electronics company, financial group ING and the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, which is owned by India’s Tata Group, struck the same downbeat tone as they unveiled plans to axe staff.In many cases, the cutbacks accompanied disappointing quarterly results or bleak outlooks for 2009, when many of the world’s largest economies are expected to be hit by severe downturns.Raymond Torres, head of the International Labour Organisation’s research institute, said employers were shedding workers far more quickly in this recession than in the early 1990s.“We have a vicious circle of depression, where job losses lead to falling consumption, which lowers industrial confidence, which leads to less investment, which results in more job losses, and so on,” he said.Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, said it would cut 20,000 jobs as it reported fourth-quarter profits more than 32 per cent lower than a year ago and warned earnings would be under pressure in 2009. The news comes a month after the US group slashed executive salaries by up to half and cut jobs at large plants.Sprint Nextel, the US mobile-phone operator, is to cut 8,000 jobs, or 14 per cent of its workforce, while DIY retailer Home Depot is shedding 7,000 posts and freezing salaries as it battles a consumer slowdown in the US.Pfizer said 19,500 people would lose their jobs after its takeover of US rival Wyeth, while General Motors, the troubled carmaker, announced 2,000 job losses at two plants in Michigan. After the US markets closed, chipmaker Texas Instruments eliminated 3,400 positions. The news in the US came after ING said it would axe 7,000 of its 130,000 global staff and Philips announced the loss of 6,000 jobs as it accelerated restructuring plans.Corus, Britain’s largest steelmaker, announced cuts of 3,500 from its global workforce of 41,000, with more than 2,000 jobs to go in the UK where it employs 20,000.News of job cuts continued on Tuesday, with Clariant, the Swiss speciality chemicals maker, shedding 1,000 jobs in sales and administration. The group, which currently employs over 20,000 people, announced a 5 per cent decline in full-year sales.Reporting by Justin Baer and Francesco Guerrera in New York, Andrew Ward in Washington, Hal Weitzman in Chicago, Richard Milne in London and Frances Williams in Geneva
258;HD;Home Depot;2009-01-26T22:37:49Z;Pfizer deal offsets Wall St earnings gloom;;Hefty declines in financial shares weighed on Wall Street on Monday as the sector’s volatile run continued, although a rare piece of dealmaking propped up the wider market during more choppy trading.Financials rallied as much as 4.3 per cent overall to lead a bullish morning session as US investors took some comfort that European banks had reassured over the need for possible capital raisings.But the relief was short-lived. A sharp afternoon sell-off left the sector 2.1 per cent lower, as fears over more heavy writedowns and uncertainty over the new administration’s plans to rescue the stricken sector returned to the fore.Citigroup and Bank of America advanced as much as 8.1 per cent and 11.9 per cent, respectively, only to stand 4 per cent and 3.9 per cent lower by the close. They finished at $3.33 and $6, respectively.“We’re going to continue to see that volatility,” said Anthony Conroy, head of trading at BNYConvergEx.Regional banks were among the heaviest losers. A bearish note on Regions Financial from Richard Bove, influential analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, helped push the sector down 3.4 per cent overall.Shares in the southeast lender dropped 12 per cent to $4.10 after Mr Bove forecast it was likely to slash its dividend from 10 cents to a penny a share.American Express was another key loser among the bigger names, down 5 per cent to $15.20, but recovered 4.3 per cent in immediate after hours trade, when the credit card group disclosed a 79 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings.Heavy volatility has returned to Wall Street in recent sessions, due in large part to violent swings in financial stocks.Last week, the benchmark S&P 500 dived beneath a nadir reached last month, sparking concerns among technical analysts that another support level could be breached.The wider market finished off its highs on Monday, but still found positive territory as Pfizer’s deal to acquire Wyeth, a rival drugmaker, demonstrated that at least some deals could be struck during the recession and amid weak credit markets.The S&P finished up 0.6 per cent to 836.57, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.5 per cent higher at 8,116.03 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.8 per cent stronger at 1,489.46.The S&P had earlier rallied as much as 2.5 per cent.Although news of the Pfizer-Wyeth tie-up had leaked, its confirmation was reassuring for the wider market – especially given that Dow Chemical said it did not have the funds to complete the immediate takeover of Rohm and Haas, whose shares tumbled 13.3 per cent to $57.10.Shares in Dow, which cited the global financial crisis and the collapse of its joint venture with Kuwait, lost 7.6 per cent to $13.24 as its target launched a lawsuit.Pfizer dropped 10.3 per cent to $15.65 while Wyeth closed down 0.8 per cent to $43.39 after a strong run last week, when talk of the deal began to circulate.Elsewhere, homebuilders stood 2.9 per cent higher overall after National Association of Realtors data showed that sales of existing homes rose last month from a record low.Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said the jump in foreclosures – and subsequent drop in prices – had contributed in large part to the 6.5 per cent increase. Still, he noted after the figures were released: “The market wants to look on the bright side of risk…and this latest data will probably encourage the mild risk recovery seen so far.”The Conference Board’s index of leading economic indicators also unexpectedly rose in December.The market’s gains came in spite of glum assessments of corporate prospects and a harsh round of job cuts. The most high-profile, Caterpillar, dropped 8.4 per cent to $32.67. Among the raft of other companies to unveil plans for hefty job losses, Home Depot climbed 4.7 per cent to $22.73 and Sprint Nextel added 1.2 per cent to $2.49. Both companies said the moves would bring sizeable cost savings.Elsewhere, McDonald’s – which along with Wal-Mart was one of only two stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to end 2008 in positive territory – added 0.7 per cent to $58.40 after the release of results that topped forecasts.
259;HD;Home Depot;2009-01-26T20:40:02Z;Caterpillar to cut 20,000 jobs as orders fall;;"Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines, on Monday warned of a “seismic adjustment” in revenues as it moved to cut 11 per cent of its workforce amid the economic downturn.The severity of the manufacturer’s actions demonstrates how industrial production and infrastructure projects globally have slowed in recent months.Although Caterpillar is widely seen as a bellwether of the US economy, it depends on markets outside North America for about 60 per cent of its sales.The scale of the global crisis was made clear on Monday as a host of other companies announced large job cuts, including Sprint Nextel and Home Depot in the US, and Corus, ING and Philips in Europe. Ninety-two per cent of US companies are cutting costs, according to a survey released on Monday by Challenger, Gray and Christmas.Caterpillar’s move to cut 20,000 jobs comes a month after the Illinois-based group slashed executive salaries by up to half, citing a decline in orders and weaker demand for engines in Caterpillar machines.The company announced the latest round of job cuts as it reported that profits in the fourth quarter of last year fell by more than 32 per cent and warned that it would struggle to make a profit in the first half of
this year.“Through the first three quarters, we experienced booming demand from key global industries, notably mining and energy,” said Jim Owens, chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar.“Then we were whipsawed in the fourth quarter as key industries were hit by a rapidly deteriorating global economy and plunging commodity prices.”Caterpillar said profit in the last quarter was $661m or $1.08 a share, down from $975m or $1.50 a share in the same period a year earlier and well below analysts’ expectations of about $1.28 per share.“Fourth-quarter profit was disappointing,” said Mr Owens. “It is now clear that we need to sharply lower our production and costs.“These are very uncertain times and it’s imperative that we focus Team Caterpillar on dramatically reducing production schedules and costs in light of poor economic conditions throughout the world,” Mr Owens continued.“While it’s painful for our employees and suppliers, it’s absolutely necessary given economic circumstances,” he added.Caterpillar said that most of the job cuts would be completed by the end of March.Mr Owens said the company expected a “seismic adjustment in top-line sales and revenues” in 2009, with sales volumes of machines and engines dropping by 30 per cent.“Profit in the first half, and particularly the first quarter, will be under severe pressure,” the company warned. “A first-quarter loss is possible.”Caterpillar shares were down on Monday by 8.4 per cent at $32.67."
260;HD;Home Depot;2008-12-29T20:31:03Z;US retailers face grim outlook;;US retailers are facing a dire outlook in 2009 as tight credit and scared consumers could lead to mass store closings and bankruptcies.As many as 200,000 retailers could shut their doors next year, up from 160,000 in 2008, said Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail consultancy. Moreover, as many as 3,000 malls and shopping centres in the US could declare bankruptcy by next July.“Major chains in every sector are filing for bankruptcy,” Flickinger said. “We’re about 370 days into a 700 to 1,000 day retail recession”Well known retailers such as Circuit City, Linens & Things and The Sharper Image have already filed for bankruptcy and chains such Best Buy, Home Depot, Kroger and Wal-Mart have said they will slow store openings next year.According to data from SpendingPulse, an information service of MasterCard Advisors, the holiday shopping season has been a disappointment for retail stores, as the economic recession has frightened shoppers into a saving frenzy. Total retail sales have been down between 5.5 and 8 per cent in November and December from last year.“A difficult economic environment combined with unfavorable weather during the last week of shopping made 2008 one of the most challenging holiday shopping seasons in decades,” said Michael McNamara, an analyst at SpendingPulse.The commerce department said earlier this month that overall US retail sales in November were down 1.8 per cent, with spending on petrol down 14.7 per cent, spending on cars down 3.3 per cent and building and gardening equipment down 1.2 per cent.“My position very clearly is the worst is yet to come,” said Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz & Associates Inc, a national retail consulting firm. “The consumer is in survival mode.”Mr Davidowitz notes that during the last five years consumers have spent 6 per cent more than they have earned and that retailers are feeling the effect of changing spending habits. Luxury, or “discretionary”, stores are being hit the hardest.Luxury retail sales have typically been more immune to economic downturns, but in this case analysts expect them suffer the most. Customers are instead focusing on buying from discount stores and purchasing necessities such as food and medicine.“The barrier is finally proving to be mortal,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase. “We’re seeing in large part a response by the cosumer to the destruction of wealth.”During the holiday season this year, which SpendingPulse defines as between November 1 and December 24, total apparel sales fell by as much as 21 per cent. Women’s apparel declined by 22 to 23 per cent and men’s apparel was off by 14.3 per cent.Meanwhile, sales of electronics and appliances dropped by 26 per cent compared to last year. Sales of more than $1,000 were a major drag on the sector, said Mr McNamara.Retailers will be forced to continue offering deep discounts to sustain their cash reserves, said Mr Flickinger. Stores are struggling to renegotiate their lines of credit with banks or suppliers as spending has dried up.“Retailers are starved for capital,” Mr Flickinger said.One area that has been struggling less than others is online retail sales, which have declined by 2.7 per cent this holiday season compared to last year, according to SpendingPulse. However, online retail spending has traditionally grown by 20 per cent a year and has never declined.Website traffic for some big retailers has also suffered, signalling that shoppers may curtailing their searches for deals online. According to research from comScore, a marketing research firm, website traffic for eBay and Best Buy were down by 16 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively, from the beginning of November until mid-December.
261;HD;Home Depot;2008-12-02T21:24:00Z;Sears before bedtime;;"An optimist falling from a skyscraper can reflect every few floors that “everything seems fine, so far”. With a bravura touch, the management of Sears Holdings on Tuesday announced both the 10th consecutive quarter of sales declines and a $500m share buyback. Chairman Eddie Lampert, who controls the hedge fund that owns half of the company, clearly has faith in Sears’ ability to bounce.Credit, at least, is not a pressing problem. Provided that suppliers continue to extend normal payment terms, the retail group has a line of credit in place until 2010 and $1.2bn of cash on hand. The downturn may even provide some relief by halting the expansion plans of competitors – a significant contributor to losses in market share since Mr Lampert decided to bash discounter Kmart together with department store chain Sears back in 2005.Yet comparable-store sales dropped by 9 per cent in the third quarter. The consensus of the six analysts who still cover the stock is that revenues, which totalled $53bn in 2007, will have dropped to $45bn by 2010. Earnings are expected to fall by three-quarters next year, similar in magnitude to the fall in the shares from their peak.The fundamental problem is it is hard to see what Sears is for. General retailers work when they become destinations in their own right. Either because they are cheap and all-encompassing (Wal-Mart) or offer superior service and convenience. A city centre department store can prosper because high rents discourage cut-price competitors and there is a large pool of customers close by. But good locations are rare and specialist stores such as Best Buy or Home Depot proliferate. But closing any of the 3,800 North American stores is costly and any serious attempt at a turnround needs a large investment. The ground is far below, but optimism alone cannot slow the fall.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

262;HD;Home Depot;2008-11-18T21:50:09Z;Wall St closes up after volatile session;;Another wild session for Wall Street stocks ended in positive territory on Tuesday after the market earlier flirted with a fresh 5½-year closing low.Rare upbeat earnings forecasts outweighed deepening concerns over the fate of the country’s automakers and grim data in the housing sector.The technology sector received a much-needed boost, up 1.9 per cent overall, on the back of well-received figures from bellwether Hewlett-Packard. The shares leapt 14.5 per cent to $33.59 after the computer maker issued a bullish profit forecast for next year.Elsewhere in the sector, Yahoo jumped 8.7 per cent to $11.55 after investors appeared to take kindly to news that Jerry Yang, co-founder who some had criticised for failing to agree to an acquisition by Microsoft, would step down as chief executive.Analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note: “This vacuum creates an opportunity to bring in a new chief who will make bold strategic moves or more likely, open the door to Microsoft,” shares in which rose 2.2 per cent to $19.62.Google lost 0.9 per cent to $297.42 on concerns his departure could spur a deal between its main competitors.Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “There is no shortage of optimists who believe that a partial Microsoft bid might achieve a bid as high as $18 per share [for Yahoo].”The benchmark S&P 500 index swung between losses that hit 2.8 per cent and gains of as much as 1.8 per cent.After a strong rally in the final hour of trading, the S&P finished 1 per cent higher at 859.11 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8 per cent stronger at 8,424.75 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index 0.1 per cent up at 1,483.27 points.Financials were down 0.8 per cent overall to hit a fresh 12-year low, as Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary, and Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, defended the $700bn bail-out of the sector.Some analysts have criticised Washington’s backtracking over toxic mortgage assets for contributing to market turmoil.Shares in Citigroupdropped 6 per cent to $8.36, as analysts remained concerned over the prospects of the group in spite of the 52,000 job cuts announced the previous day.Concerns over the future of the country’s carmakers weighed on the market.General Motors and Ford lost 2.8 per cent to $3.09 and 2.3 per cent to $1.68, respectively, as Rick Wagoner, GM’s chief executive, warned the US economy would suffer a “catastrophic collapse” were the domestic carmakers allowed to fail.The market took a turn for the worse in earlier trading after the release of November’s homebuilder sentiment data, which fell to their lowest level ever.Other economic data released on Tuesday were mixed. Producer prices fell in October by 2.8 per cent, the most on record, although so-called core prices, which exclude energy and food costs, rose more than forecast to 0.4 per cent.There was some relatively bright news from the retail sector, where Home Depot advanced 3.6 per cent to $20.71.Although the home improvement chain disclosed a 31 per cent drop in third-quarter profit, the figures were nevertheless not as bad as had been expected.Amazon lost 3.2 per cent to $38.44 after Barclays cut its price target on the stock from $50 to $46 and warned that the online retailer “could see weakness across key categories”.Energy led the market gains, up 3.3 per cent overall. That came even as crude oil dipped slightly and Barclays cut its outlook on the sector.Barclays analysts said: “We believe there is considerably more bad news to come . . . in the form of rig count reductions and earnings deterioration, and the possibility of a further sharp drop in oil and natural gas prices may even cause our reduced forecasts to be optimistic.”Defensive names continued to perform relatively well. David Rosenberg, analyst at Merrill Lynch, told clients of changes in consumer behaviour: “We continue to see signs that a new pattern of spending behaviour is taking hold in the aftermath of the housing, credit and oil shocks – it is called frugality.”

264;HD;Home Depot;2008-10-06T20:46:27Z;Wall St plummets to four-year lows;;A sharp sell-off in US equities pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average below 10,000 as concerns heightened that banking crises would deepen and further hurt the global economy.The Dow’s tumble took it to levels not seen since October 2004 in spite of plans from the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity into the credit and commercial paper markets.“This is unbelievable,” said Thomas Wilson of Brinker Capital, when the S&P 500 had fallen as much as 8.3 per cent. “You’re seeing panic selling. Folks have just had enough and they want to get out.”But stocks rallied from their lows late in the session. Some analysts said hedge fund redemptions – which have driven stocks sharply lower in recent sessions – were less than anticipated. The S&P 500 closed down 3.9 per cent at 1,056.87 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 4.3 per cent at 1,862.96 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3.6 per cent to 9,955.50.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, surged as much as 29 per cent above 50 for the first time in its 18-year history. It later eased to stand 14.9 per cent higher at 51.87, still a record.Energy stocks suffered as the price of oil slid below $90 a barrel on fears of a global slowdown. Five energy stocks declined by more than 10 per centThe sector overall fell 3.6 per cent. Among the biggest declines, National Oilwell, Tesoro and Range Resources, lost 10.3 per cent at $37.02, 12.2 per cent at $12.22 and 13 per cent at $29.72, respectively.In materials, which fell 4.4 per cent, Alcoa lost 5.9 per cent to $18.11 after UBS slashed its price target from $46 to $25 ahead of its earnings tomorrow. Monsanto, which also announces its third-quarter earnings this week, lost 9.3 per cent to $75.48.National City was among the biggest losers in financials, slumping 27.1 per cent to $2.56 after Fitch downgraded the Ohio lender’s debt rating.After the market closed, Bank of America announced plans for a $10bn capital raising. In third-quarter earnings released two weeks earlier than planned, the bank reported a 68 per cent drop in net profit and halved its dividend.Down 6.6 per cent to $32.22 at the close, the shares lost another 9.1 per cent in after hours trading.Financials fell as much as 8.7 per cent as money markets remained in paralysis but stood 4.2 per cent lower by the close.Hartford Financial, hard hit in recent sessions, was one of only seven stocks to find positive territory in the S&P 500. The insurer gained 12.8 per cent to $30.90 after it said Allianz would invest $2.5bn.Citigroup, whose bid for Wachovia was last week scuppered by Wells Fargo, fell another 5.1 per cent at $17.41. Yesterday, it filed a lawsuit against the pair. Wachovia was down 6.9 per cent at $5.78 and Wells Fargo was 2.7 per cent to $33.64.The market declines were wide-ranging and took in normally defensive stocks. Wal-Mart slid 3.1 per cent to $57.90 after UBS cut its recommendation on the stock from “buy” to “neutral”. The retailer was “unlikely to be immune’’ to a global slowdown. UBS also cut its recommendation on Home Depot, home improvement retailer, which fell 4.2 per cent to $22.82.Elsewhere, Deutsche cut its recommendation on Coca-Cola from “buy” to “hold” due in part to lower global demand. The shares lost 3.1 per cent to $50.92.In industrials, General Electric at one point slid to its lowest level in 11 years ahead of its earnings later in the week, down 0.9 per cent to $21.38 after Barclays Capital analyst Robert Cornell cut his profit forecast.Technology was another key laggard, down 4.0 per cent overall. Google was down 4.1 per cent at $371.21. Ebay fell 5.5 per cent to $17.89 even after the online auctioneer announced plans to cut about 10 per cent of its workforce. The group warned third-quarter revenue would be at the lower end of its previous forecast.The Fed’s move to increase the size of its lending facility was the latest in a series of measures by authorities to shore up confidence in the financial system.With banks across the world affected by the liquidity crisis, there are increasing calls for a co-ordinated response from regulators and central banks. Other measures has so far included a temporary ban on shorting financial stocks. “If you can’t short financials you end up shorting the S&P 500,” said Marc Groz, chief executive of Topos, a hedge fund.
265;HD;Home Depot;2008-09-09T19:09:36Z;In search of a floor: Is America’s house price crash at last bottoming out?;;For Leon Belenky, the low came at the beginning of summer. “Everybody was sitting on the sidelines,” says the Florida real estate broker. “They were waiting to see what was going to happen and no one was buying.”But Mr Belenky, a former software consultant who moved from New York in the mid-1990s to deal in beachfront condominiums and other high-end homes, says he recently detected an improvement. That came even before the cautious optimism generated by the government takeover at the weekend of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two mortgage giants.He says American buyers seem ready to move back into the market, whereas previously interest was confined to foreigners trying to take advantage of the weak dollar. At Jade Beach, a luxury high-rise development just north of Miami, clients are following through on commitments to buy several units. Mr Belenky had been nervous they might back out. “Although we are still seeing some turbulence on Wall Street, I think the worst is already behind us,” he says.Property professionals are famously optimistic. But there are very tentative signs that the US housing slump could be in the first stages of moderating, after battering the global banking industry and dragging the US economy to its knees. The pace of decline is no longer growing worse and may indeed be decelerating.Across the global financial system, the search for a floor in US housing is being followed closely. Even if prices continued to decline for a while at a declining pace, reduced uncertainty as to where they would end up stabilising would allow banks to put a firmer price tag on their losses and start generating credit again. In turn, that could help bolster other troubled housing markets, notably in the UK.Across metropolitan America, the drop in house prices has eased from a monthly rate of 2.2 per cent six months ago to 0.5 per cent in June, according to the latest Standard & Poor’s Case-Shiller index. Over the same period in Miami, Mr Belenky’s market, the pace of house price declines slowed from 4.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent.Meanwhile, the volume of new and existing home sales has stabilised – at a low level – across the US, after dropping considerably in the first half-year or so of the credit crisis. According to the most optimistic predictions, these trends could be mutually reinforcing this autumn, paving the way for a recovery early next year. But there are a lot of time- lags in the housebuying process. Some analysts fear that the problems at Fannie and Freddie between June and August – which pushed up mortgage rates over that period – will soon show up in weaker home sales.That is not the only problem, as Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, points out. “The expected stabilisation in the mortgage markets resulting from the US government’s action will help bring down mortgage rates,” he says. “But they do not solve the problem of rising foreclosures and falling house prices.”Still, the government rescue of the twin mortgage funders should guarantee the supply of affordable home loans in the coming months. That could ensure that any weak patch in sales is relatively short-lived, locking in one necessary condition for any recovery: stable turnover.If sales remain at present levels – a big “if” – inventories of unsold new homes could decline rapidly in the final months of this year and early next year, as the effect of past drops in home starts finally feeds through to home completions. That would still leave a large inventory of existing homes available for sale.Frank Blake, chief executive of Home Depot, the second largest US retailer, was nonetheless seeing light at the end of the tunnel even before the Fannie-Freddie move. “We don’t think we’re at the bottom yet – but we think you can see it from here,” he says. Investors also seem keener than before to wager on a recovery. Shares in Regions Financial, Alabama’s biggest bank, rose more than 15 per cent last week after it took over the branches of Georgia-based Integrity, which collapsed at the end of August because of the mortgage crisis and was seized by regulators.But for all the glimmers of hope, a rapid turnround in America’s housing market looks unlikely. For many economists, its return to vigour will be long and agonising – and they warn that any progress could quickly unravel. It is hard to believe we are at the bottom. Several indicators of the health of the housing market are still troubling. According to RealtyTrac, a property website, one out of every 464 households received a foreclosure filing in July, compared with one in 557 in February. Foreclosures are not likely to peak until the first quarter of 2009, according to analysts at Lehman Brothers.Last week, Fitch Ratings sounded another alarm bell, saying as much as $96bn (£54bn, €68bn) in home loans sold with initial flexible payments will switch to more stringent terms, probably forcing even more borrowers into foreclosures. Delinquency rates on prime loans, as well as subprime and other exotic mortgages, are climbing.Rising foreclosures prevent a reduction in the inventories of unsold homes and raise the danger of local foreclosure “spirals” as fire sales depress prices of other homes in the neighbourhood. As of July, the National Association of Realtors says, it would take a record 11.2 months to work through the supply of previously owned homes.The mortgage crisis has repeatedly disappointed policymakers since it began 18 months ago. House prices remain elevated on some measures, such as price-to-rent ratios. Moreover, efforts to arrange economically efficient restructurings of mortgage debts – and thereby minimise unnecessary foreclosures – remain an uphill struggle. That is due in large part to the fragmented investor base, with numerous institutions owning a slice of a securitised mortgage.Looking ahead, one main concern is the interplay between housing and the wider US economy, in particular the jobs market. Unemployment has jumped from 4.9 per cent of the workforce in January to 6.1 per cent, amid eight consecutive months of job losses. As more Americans struggle to keep their jobs, it will be harder for them to buy property, no matter how cheap it looks.This year’s jump in the price of petrol could also damp the potential for a housing recovery. Many of the neighbourhoods with the biggest oversupply of homes are on the distant fringes of US cities. These areas have been made less attractive by the much higher costs of commuting by car. Furthermore, with the mortgage markets under strain, lenders have raised the bar for prospective buyers, which is making sales harder to clinch and putting further downward pressure on prices.“Risk-averse lenders are requiring buyers to bring more equity and higher [credit] scores. Even those who qualify are finding it tough to get properties to appraise” – in other words, to have the proposed purchase price endorsed by the lender’s valuer – “or to obtain mortgage insurance, as the entire industry has become more cautious”, says Paul Miller, analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey, a property investment group.With the subprime sector all but evaporated and the jumbo market (for loans into the millions of dollars) barely alive, about three-quarters of mortgage loans are now guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Prior to their takeover, risk spreads on their debt and on their mortgage-backed securities were at near record levels, while the companies were tightening underwriting standards and raising fees to preserve their own capital. That helped keep mortgage rates higher than they were a year ago, in spite of 325 basis points of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.Now, as risk-spreads on Fannie and Freddie paper narrow again and the fees they charge are under downward pressure, a significant decline in mortgage rates finally comes into prospect. That would improve affordability and should at least result in house prices falling less than they otherwise would have done. Over time, the move could also entice buyers away from the sidelines, because the guarantee of an ongoing supply of affordable home loans reduces the risk of a truly catastrophic decline in house prices.The problem is that employment and incomes could push the other way – resulting in a more traditional housing downturn driven by recessionary conditions in the broad economy rather than overvaluation and a credit shock.“We are keeping a watchful eye on residential real estate, to be sure – especially the inventory-to-sales ratio and home prices and the impact of this latest policy intervention,” says David Rosenberg, chief US economist at Merrill Lynch, referring to the federal rescue of Fannie and Freddie. But even if the market begins to bottom soon, “the lead time to the end of the consumer recession is likely a year away at a minimum”.That in itself would limit the number of Florida home hunters arriving at Mr Belenky’s door.WAR GAMES DEPLOYED AS EUROPE FRETS OVER BANKSBy Nikki Tait, Ralph Atkins and Peter Thal LarsenFor European policymakers, the woes of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have given fresh impetus to a question that has dogged them for a year,: what if one of the continent’s own big cross-border institutions ran into trouble?What, for example, if the Northern Rockcustomers (pictured) had been queuing not just outside the UK mortgage lender’s branches in places such as Golders Green and Sunderland but also in Gothenberg and Seville? What if it had not been Germany’s WestLBthat needed a bail-out but instead a bigger organisation with cross-border operations such as Deutsche Bank, UniCredit or UBS?The grim realisation that mechanisms for dealing with the failure of a big multinational banking group might be inadequate has sent policymakers scurrying back to their drawing boards. It is an issue that will feature prominently over the next two days, when European Union finance ministers gather for informal discussions in Nice while regulators and financial service industry heavyweights hold a conference next door.It is not just policymakers who are troubled by the issue. Banks, which have been frustrated for years by the balkanised nature of Europe’s approach to financial regulation, worry about the lack of clarity over the allocation of responsibilities among so-called “home” and “host” regulators. “There is still confusion about who to call if there is a problem,” says one banker.Some action has already been taken. This year, the European Central Bank, EU central banks and finance ministries agreed in principle to improve co-operative procedures. In a memorandum, the three sides noted that financial integration “increases the scope for cross-border and cross-sector contagion” and thus the likelihood of a “systemic crisis affecting more than one state”. As a result, it added, it was important to have EU-level “common principles, procedures and practical arrangements concerning co-operation among the authorities responsible for preserving financial stability”.The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is separately drawing up guidelines for managing banks’ liquidity requirements. A pan-European framework for protecting bank depositors has also been discussed.The European Commission has been active, too. In draft proposals it has called for the establishment of “colleges” of supervisors to oversee all cross-border banking groups. This proposal reflects the fact that Brussels has had to frame its response within a roadmap agreed by finance ministers last autumn that ruled out any shift towards an EU super-regulator or common EU standards.The Commission envisages that rules governing information flows and decision-making responsibilities would be beefed up. Brussels is expected to produce formal legislative proposals at the beginning of next month. The shape these will take is thought to be very fluid at present – but already the Commission’sthinking has run into political difficulties.Some smaller member states worry that subsidiaries of cross-border groups will be held to a different standard from purely domestic companies. Another concern, shared by some regulators, is how rescue costs would be divided up or how assets needed to meet local liquidity needs might be transferred. What if a failing bank were seen as no systemic risk to its home market but had relatively greater importance in another national jurisdiction?The ECB meanwhile remains worried about legal obstacles that might hinder the flow of information between regulators and central banks.Regulators are also having to reconsider their reluctance to spell out their exact response to any future crisis for fear of encouraging greater risk-taking by banks – what Sir Eddie George, former governor of the Bank of England, called “constructive ambiguity”. The recent crisis has shown the limitations of an approach that lacks clarity which institutions were deemed too big to fail.Regulators remain concerned that the system is untested. Eurozone officials are currently understood to be planning a discreet global “war game” – an exercise in which crises are simulated. It would include institutions outside the EU.
266;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Helping retailers find a common language;;"US retailers such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot advertise to America’s Hispanic consumers on Spanish-language television. Some, such as JC Penney, operate bilingual customer service centres that can take orders over the phone.But online shopping, which now accounts for about 7 per cent of US retail spending, has largely remained an English language experience – because getting a rapidly changing e-commerce website to speak Spanish as well entails much more than hiring a few translators.“It traditionally involves a lot of IT infrastructure work. And one of the big obstacles is the idea that they’d have to invest, or hire someone to manage a Spanish language site . . . and retail is such a low-margin business,” says John Yunker of Byte Level, a consultancy focused on website globalisation.But there are signs of change ahead, driven largely by the growing success of a web services company, MotionPoint, which set out to find a technology-based solution to the problem of getting a single website to speak more than one language.Since it was founded in 2000, MotionPoint has expanded rapidly over the past two years to a client list that now includes more than 200 companies, including Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Amtrak and Domino’s Pizza.MotionPoint still uses human translators. But, according to Will Fleming, its chief executive and founder, translation only accounts for a quarter of the activity involved in forming a multilingual version of a site; IT infrastructure and site management challenges make up the rest.“We are a technology company, not a translation company,” he says. “We don’t claim to actually translate the words faster than anyone else.”When a customer wants to access a foreign language version of a particular site, page or item, a MotionPoint server passes on the request to the original site. The response, in English, prompts MotionPoint to retrieve a previously translated version of the page or item held in its own stored data and send it on to the customer.The foreign language versions of each page or product are kept updated by human translators, who use software that ensures the translation fits the space available on the page. They are also automatically alerted to changes made on the original site, enabling material to be updated within a few hours rather than the days required by a “traditional” operation with translators not working directly on a web-based system.Chuck Whiteman, who handles client relations for the company, says that its claims have often been met by scepticism – such as its ability to launch a fully translated site within three months, against the one year or more required by other solutions. Delta Air Lines, he says, challenged the veracity of AmTrak’s endorsement of the service before it started working with MotionPoint on its global reservation site in 2005. The scepticism, much of it from the IT department, was overcome, and Delta adopted the service for multiple languages, including Japanese.MotionPoint’s clients include international brands such as Puma and Delta, but the company says that about three-quarters of its business is now focused on the US Hispanic market. Late last year, it worked with Best Buy, the largest US home electronics retailer, to launch a Spanish version of its e-commerce site.Best Buy, says Mr Whiteman, also initially doubted its claim it could produce a Spanish version of its site in less than 90 days. “In the end, we did it in 87,” he says.The comparative ease with which MotionPoint is able to translate entire sites has enabled some of its customers to adopt online languages they might not otherwise have considered. Amtrak, the US passenger train operator, initially used MotionPoint to create a Spanish-language reservation site. When it realised how popular this was with customers coming from Europe, it added a German-language version too.Elsewhere, only a handful of US retailers offer bilingual websites, lagging behind banks, insurance companies, airlines and telephone companies. And most of the sites that are available in Spanish, such as Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, or Walgreens, the drugstore, offer only product information or advice rather than the opportunity to buy online.But in a reflection of the growing interest among retailers, Amazon, the largest US online retailer, has used its own resources to launch Spanish pages for Spanish-language books and software.Jupiter Research forecast last year that Hispanic consumers would account for 13 per cent of US sales on the internet in 2011.Steve Davis of GSI Commerce, which provides global web services to retailers, notes that MotionPoint’s solution is particularly suited to US sites, in contrast to Europe, where site owners wishing to serve more than one language group have simply constructed separate sites from the ground up. In the US, he says, translating a site into Spanish can be like “trying to change the engine when the car is going full speed down the road.”Mr Yunker at Byte Level says US retailers and others now going into Spanish online still have work to do, such as deciding whether to opt for a specific regional dialect or aiming for a more standardised version of the language. And there is still no standard approach over the best way of guiding Hispanic customers on-screen to the Spanish version of a site. But those customers, he argues, are likely to appreciate the effort, even those who speak perfect English.“If you look at the demographics in the US, you have to plan for working in more than one language if you want to connect,” says Mr Yunker. “Even if people are speaking in English, they might still be dreaming in Spanish.”"
267;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;US shoppers turn away from credit;;Middle-class US consumers are increasingly leaving their credit cards at home when they go shopping, extending a trend first shown by Wal-Mart’s low-income shoppers last year, and adding to the pressures on US retailers’ sluggish sales.Mainstream retailers are reporting that shoppers are opting for debit cards or cash instead of credit cards as they face tighter credit limits, illustrating how the wider credit crunch is being transferred to main street spending.Target, the discounter with over 1,500 stores across the US, said last week that it had seen the share of total payments made using credit cards fall for the first time ever in its second quarter, while the use of debit cards continued to rise.The retailer said the resulting slowing of credit use has in turn hurt its sales performance – which saw a slight decline in sales at stores open for at least a year during the quarter.“Clearly the aggregate access that our guests have to credit cards…is one of the issues that is determining our same-store sales performance in the current environment,” Doug Scovanner, Target’s chief operating officer, told investors.Lowe’s, the US home improvement retailer whose sales fell 5.3 per cent year-on-year in the six months to August 1, also reported an increase in the mix of cash and debit card use during the latest quarter.Kohl’™s, the budget department store chain, reported an increase in the use of its Kohl’s credit card, which rewards loyal shoppers with monthly savings.But it said the share of payments made by regular bank credit cards and cash had both declined, while it also saw a rise in debit card use. The retailers’ experiences on the shop floor reflect the broader slowdown in the growth of credit.MasterCard, the payments network, said US credit card use was virtually unchanged in the second quarter, with a slight 0.7 per cent increase in total payments, against a 16 per cent increase in debit card use.Visa’s US credit card payments increased 8 per cent, while debit card use increased by 16 per cent.In addition to accepting bank credit cards, most US retailers also issue their own charge cards and co-branded credit cards in partnership with issuing banks.Retailers use these own-brand cards to promote customer loyalty through offering discounts to card holders, and to gather data on their customers’ shopping habits.However, both banks and retailers have been tightening the terms both on their existing cards and on new applicants, in part to reflect declining credit scores that are the result of the increasing economic pressures on their customers.Lowe’s said the share of payments using its own-brand credit card fell 100 basis points in the second quarter to 22 per cent.Target, which co-issues store-branded credit cards with JPMorgan Chase, has followed other card issuers by increasing interest charges on existing accounts and what it describes as “aggressive reduction of credit lines and significant tightening of all aspects of our underwriting”.Home Depot, the second largest US retailer, says it has seen “significant erosion” of credit scores which led it to reduce some credit limits on existing card holders whose cards accounted for almost 30 per cent of its sales last year.Wesley McDonald, Kohl’s chief financial officer, noted that while its charge card performed strongly in the second quarter, accounting for 44 per cent of sales, the rate at which it is issuing new cards is slowing.“Part of that is just obviously with people having more economic difficulties, their credit scores are falling across the country,” he told investors this month.
268;HD;Home Depot;2008-08-25T19:47:50Z;Retailers’ woes hit real estate investors;;When Boscov’s filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month, it was the latest in a slew of retailers to be pulled under as consumers have reined in their spending.But as the mid-range Pennsylvania retailer held closing sales at 10 of its 49 stores last week, the little-known company’s woes were a sign of how troubles facing US retailers will also hit investors in the buildings that house them.Simon Property Group and General Growth Properties, two major real estate investment trusts that between them own six of the malls in which the Boscov’s department stores sit, will struggle to fill the vacant space in a weak retail environment.There could also be problems for investors who hold Boscov’s debt. Boscov’s mortgages on seven of the stores that are closing were packaged up by Bank of America into a commercial mortgage backed security deal.Boscov’s is late in payments on the $117m in debt, according to Bloomberg data. If it defaults on the loans, owners of the lower classes of bonds will face losses, although Darryl Wheeler, an analyst at Citigroup does not expect them to be major.In total, Boscov’s has more than $1.53bn in outstanding loans spread through $52.75bn worth of CMBS deals, property data company Realpoint calculates, signalling how wide the company’s problems could spread, although it has not announced any other store closures. Boscov’s did not respond to calls for comment.Boscov’s bankruptcy emphasises the growing problems in retail property, which is expected to be the worst hit property sector outside of residential.“Boscov’s expanded too quickly,” said Mr Cardone. “Most of the problems [in retail property] come from over-aggressive expansion. We expect to see more of this.”Beyond Boscov’s a long list of companies such as gadget seller Sharper Image, discount women’s clothes store Steven and Barry’s and Linens N Things, a home furnishings chain, have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent months.Major retailers, such as Home Depot, Zales and Starbucks are also closing stores, and others such as JC Penney are holding back on renewing existing leases or store openings.The result is a market facing a flood of empty space, especially in many parts of the country where the housing boom was most pronounced, with vacancy rates rising to their highest since 1996 in the second quarter according to Reis.“Declines in retail sales in once-hot housing markets in Florida, Arizona, Nevada and Southern and Central California have been significant, and owners of malls in these regions could get more severely battered as a result,” said analysts at Green Street Advisors in a recent note.The rising vacancy and slowing demand for space is beginning to hit the businesses of public retail property investors.General Growth is delaying $500m of development because of the poor retail environment and difficulties securing credit, and recorded weaker than expected profits in the last quarter.“Now is not the best time to be opening new projects,” said John Bucksbaum, the company’s chief executive, after reporting its last results, spurring a sharp drop in the company’s shares.Overall, a rise in speculative building means the proportion of store space filled by tenants when construction is completed has slipped sharply from a historical average of more than 80 per cent to just over 60 per cent in the last two years, Reis reports.Prices for retail buildings have fallen 4 per cent since their peak in the third quarter of last year – less than the 11 per cent decline in office buildings – but Sam Chandan of Reis puts this down to the fact that wary buyers and lenders are only agreeing deals on the safest, best properties.This weak environment has helped drag down construction of shops, which is now falling at its fastest rate in nearly three decades, according to projections from McGraw Hill Construction. “What’s made it dramatic is how quick the decline has been,” said Bob Murray, of McGraw Hill.Mr Murray puts the speed of the slowdown down to the range of problems facing the industry – the credit crisis, the worst housing market since the Great Depression, rising inflation and a struggling economy – as well as greater transparency in property markets allowing a quicker correction.The decline in shop building comes after an extended period where developers raced to erect retail space to keep pace with residential building, and consumer spending grew fast fuelled by mounting personal debts often secured against the value of their homes.More store space was built in 2005 and 2007 than any other years since McGraw Hill’s records began in 1967.“The pace of development picked up as consumers used their home equity like ATMs, spending much of this newfound equity at the mall or neighbourhood shopping center,” says Ben Yang, an analyst at Green Street Advisors.
269;HD;Home Depot;2008-08-19T20:47:00Z;Wall Street stocks endure further pain;;"US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors responded to deepening worries about the financial sector, inflation and disappointing economic data.Financials continued to lead losses in the broader stock market, with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae once again in sharp focus.Worries about possible dilutive capital-raising by the two government-sponsored mortgage lenders led to further losses with Freddie shares down 5 per cent at $4.17 and Fannie shares falling 2.3 per cent to $6.01. Both had fallen sharply in the previous session.Lehman Brothers shares fell 13 per cent to $13.07 amid reports that the Wall Street bank might sell part of its investment-management business and as analysts raised the possibility of further writedowns.Most other financial sector companies, with the exception of credit card providers, were in negative territory for the day. Among other big fallers were HSBC, whose depository receipts fell 2.5 per cent to $77.29; Wells Fargo, down 3.5 per cent to $27.79; and JPMorgan, which was 3.2 per cent lower at $35.58. Morgan Stanley shares were 3.8 per cent down at $38.08.American International Group fell back as analysts warned of the possibility of more writedowns. Its shares lost 5.9 per cent to $20.32.The S&P Financial Index was off 3 per cent for the day at 267.18, while the S&P Investment Banking Index was down 3.2 per cent at 106.30.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was 0.9 per cent lower at 1,266.70 points while the Nasdaq Composite index was 1.35 per cent lower at 2,384.36 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.1 per cent at 11,348.55 points.Stock market investors responded to two pieces of economic news.Core producer prices, which exclude food and energy, jumped 0.7 per cent in July after a 0.2 per cent June increase, the fastest rise in monthly core producer prices since November 2006.Michael Woolfolk, a senior strategist at The Bank of New York Mellon, said: “The rise in core inflation is troubling. It is clear that headline inflation is spilling over into the core at an accelerating rate.”US builders slowed construction on new homes in July to the lowest annual rate in 16 years. The US commerce department said US July housing starts fell 11 per cent to a 965,000 annual rate, the lowest level since March 1991.That sent homebuilder shares to a three-week low. Shares in Centex Corporation were down 4.5 per cent at $14.05 and those in Pulte Homes fell 3.7 per cent to $12.07.In earnings news, several retailers issued downbeat results, as consumers continued to cut spending amid the slowing of the wider economy.Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, reported a 24 per cent drop in second-quarter profit.Home Depot said earnings fell to $1.2bn, or 71 cents a share, in the second quarter, from $1.59bn, or 81 cents a share, in the same period last year. The shares were down 3.7 per cent at $25.96. Retail group Target reported a 7.6 per cent drop in second-quarter profit. Its shares in fell 0.7 per cent to $49.72.Shares in retailers Saks and Staples dropped after both companies said that their second-half performances would miss forecasts.Saks shares fell 8.3 per cent to $10.29 after it reported its biggest quarterly loss in two years on discounts for women’s apparel and said second-half sales would be lower than it had forecast.The S&P retailers index was dragged down by the generally disappointing earnings news to stand at 2.7 per cent lower at 383.12. Hewlett-Packard reported a slight rise in second-quarter earnings after the market closed and its shares rose in after hours trading having ended the trading session down 2 per cent at $43.69.In corporate news, aircraft builder General Dynamics agreed to buy Swiss company Jet Aviation for $2.25bn in cash. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2008. Shares in General Dynamics were down 0.3 per cent at $91.99.The energy sector held up relatively well amid the wider sell-off, with most companies in positive territory as the price of crude oil made ground after falls in early trading."
270;HD;Home Depot;2008-08-19T18:28:52Z;Leading stores suffer from US slowdown;;The breadth of the slowdown in discretionary US spending was underlined on Tuesday by quarterly results from Home Depot, the home improvement store, Target, the mass discounter, and Saks, the luxury fashion retailer.Saks saw its shares fall over 8 per cent to $10.29 at the New York close after it reported a $31.7m loss on softening demand for its luxury ­clothing, shoes and accessories.Saks also predicted flat or falling comparable sales for the second half of the year. Over the first six months of the year Saks comparable store sales have increased just 2.7 per cent, compared to the high-single digit growth it saw before the economic slowdown started to hit higher-end consumers at the end of last year.Steve Sadove, chief executive, said that the retailer had “experienced a softening across nearly all geographies and merchandise categories” during the quarter.He also said that the retailer had seen price increases of between 10 and 15 per cent in the cost of some of its European brands which it would pass on to customers in the coming weeks, reflecting the weakness of the dollar over much of the current year.The retailer said sales commissions from its leased departments, which include Louis Vuitton handbags - were unchanged from the previous quarterThe retailer reported a net loss of $31.7m, or 23 cents per share, while revenues fell 3 per cent to $669m, a fall due in part to the shift of a spring clearance sale to the first quarter.At the other end of the retail spectrum, Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement store, reported a 5.4 per cent fall in total sales, and a 7.9 per cent fall in comparable stores, as sales of products from paint to electrical goods fell.Comparable sales of stores in California and Florida – the areas in the US most hit by the housing slump – fell by more than 10 per cent, mirroring results at Home Depot’s rival, Lowe’s.Carol Tome, Home Depot’s chief financial officer, said that, while statistics suggested that the decline in home improvement spending should be bottoming out, other factors such as the uncertain mortgage market and rising costs for consumers were continuing to weigh on the sector.“We should be getting towards the bottom, but there’s all this other ­uncertainty that cause us to remain cautious not just for the back half of 2008, but also into 2009,” she said.Target, the mass ­discounter which aims at a more prosperous customer than its market rival, Wal-Mart, also reported a fall in profits and sales, with net earnings down 8 per cent to $634m.While new store openings pushed total revenues to $15bn, sales at stores open at least a year fell 0.4 per cent.Home Depot’s shares fell over 2 per cent to $26.39 while Target’s shares slipped less than one per cent to $49.70
271;HD;Home Depot;2008-07-02T19:05:11Z;Starbucks goes skinny as froth withers;;As US consumer demand started to falter last summer, Starbucks was opening new company-owned stores in the US at the rate of three a day.But on Tuesday the world’s largest coffee retailer decisively put its foot on the brake, with Peter Bocian, chief financial officer, bidding farewell to the era of growth that has made Starbucks’ green and white sign a symbol of urban America.“We believe with the stores we have today, and incrementally [adding] a couple of hundred more per year, we will have the right answer for Starbucks in the United States,” he said.In its coming 2009 fiscal year, which starts in October, it plans to open fewer than 200 new US company-operated locations, down from this year’s reduced target of 650, and the more than 1,000 US company-operated stores that opened in both 2006 and 2007.Starbucks also plans to close 600 stores, many of them less than two years old, leaving a network of more than 6,600 company-run stores in the US, as well as more than 4,000 licensed outlets in locations such as airports, bookstores and supermarkets.Mr Bocian argued the decision to close stores and slow growth reflected more than the current economic climate, following a detailed review of local market factors by the company’s real estate team.“We believe absolutely that we’re seeing a major impact from the economy,” he told investors and analysts. But, he added, the decision to close the 600 stores had been taken because of other factors too. “We didn’t believe it was all economy”.Those factors include proximity to other stores – reflecting Starbucks original readiness to allow new openings to cannibalise about 30 per cent of the traffic at existing stores as a way of reducing lines and improving customer service.This aspect of the cutbacks in planned growth mirrors similar decisions by two very different but equally ubiquitous US retailers – Wal-Mart, and Home Depot, the home improvement chain.Over the past year the two largest US retailers have slowed new store expansion plans and capital investment, with Home Depot saying in May it would close 15 of its underperforming superstores. Like Starbucks, both Wal-Mart and Home Depot are approaching saturation coverage of the available markets, with new stores taking some customer traffic away from existing outlets.But at the same time, the slowdown in demand is manifesting itself in a string of store closures and trimmed expansion plans from retailers that are more clearly linked to economic conditions.JC Penney, the mainstream department store, said last week, for instance, that it was planning to open 20, rather than 50 stores in 2009, and was halving capital spending plans.Other retailers have also announced the closure of underperforming stores, including Ann Taylor, Liz Claiborne and Talbots, the women’s fashion retailers and Zales, the jewellers.Richard Hastings, consumer strategist at Global Hunter Securities, noted that the current inflationary environment, combined with slowing demand, was making capital expenditure reductions increasingly attractive to retailers. Cutting store costs and expenditure on new stores were “the most logical next steps in this story once you saw demand begin to decline in the summer of 2007”.Starbucks says it is not actively expecting any further closures, but will be closely monitoring the performance of its remaining US store portfolio. Its international expansion plans also remain unchanged, with a further 950 new licensed and company-owned stores opening this year, including its first store in Argentina.It also argues that its store development team will be more effective, under a new president of global development, Arthur Rubenfeld, a veteran of its 1990s expansion, who recently rejoined the company.Mr Bocian also said Starbucks would be looking at further cost-cutting measures under Howard Schultz, its chief executive, that are aimed at restoring the reputation of the brand battered by its expansion.“We understand we are in a tough economic environment and have to innovate and invest but also work on things we can control.”
272;HD;Home Depot;2008-06-19T21:27:17Z;Cerberus up for Chrysler challenge;;Cerberus Capital Management, the US private equity group, is hunkering down for the long haul at Chrysler, admitting it may be a decade before it sells the struggling carmaker acquired in a $7.4bn deal that epitomised last year’s bull market.Timothy Price, managing director of Cerberus, told the Financial Times that his group often owned companies longer than rivals before seeking an exit.“We have a model that is buy, fix and hold,” he said. “It is not a problem for us to have a 10-year holding period.”Shrugging off the sharp fall in car sales in the US, which triggered a 25 per cent drop in sales of its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands in May compared with a year earlier, Mr Price said “everything is going better than expected”.Chrysler was forecast to lose $1.6bn last year following a $1.4bn loss in 2006, when it was still owned by Germany’s Daimler. For many, the purchase of the marque has become the poster boy for private equity’s battle to turn round troubled companies bought during a credit boom before markets nosedived last summer. However, Mr Price declined to say when Chrysler would stop burning through cash and return to positive cash flow.Chrysler ended 2007 with $9bn of cash on its debt-free balance sheet, and Bob Nardelli, who took over as chief executive after his controversial departure from Home Depot, told the FT it was still “very close” to this.Denying that Cerberus had any regrets about buying Chrysler and insisting that, given the choice, it would still do the deal, Mr Price said: “The industry is cyclical and demand does not drop 20 per cent every year in the US auto market.”Chrysler is buying more components for its vehicles outside North America, both to bring down costs and to help establish a foothold in overseas markets, where it has little or no presence.In recent years, Chrysler’s international strategy has focused on expanding exports from plants in North America and, to a lesser extent, Europe.Although sales outside North America reached a record of 21,500 vehicles in May, that was still only 12 per cent of sales in the US and Canada.
273;HD;Home Depot;2008-06-19T18:21:40Z;Can Chrysler dodge crisis in re-engineering of marque?;;"Twice a day, Bob Nardelli and other top managers at Chrysler receive latest details of the carmaker’s cash position on their BlackBerrys. Mr Nardelli, chairman and chief executive since August, displays figures on vehicle shipments and retail sales on an easel outside his office on the 15th floor of Chrysler’s headquarters in Auburn Hills, north of Detroit.Setting and meeting precise targets were Mr Nardelli’s hallmark as a turnround artist at General Electric’s power systems division and, more recently and controversially, at Home Depot, the hardware chain. But his skills are being tested as never before at Chrysler.Mr Nardelli was brought in after a deal that saw Germany’s Daimler sell an 80 per cent stake in the US company to Cerberus Capital Management, the New York buy-out firm. The deal marked the first private equity takeover of a big carmaker.No one can accuse Mr Nardelli or his colleagues – several recruited from outside Chrysler and outside the motor industry – of treating the smallest of Detroit’s big three carmakers with kid gloves. Signs of change wrought by new management abound, from a 15 per cent cut in the workforce, a revamped relationship with dealers and the elimination of several models, to details such as alterations in vehicle exhausts so that they do not crackle as they cool.In better times, the industry would have applauded these efforts and Cerberus and its investors might even have been contemplating an early spin-off of Chrysler at a handsome profit. But this year’s sharp drop in US vehicle sales – especially of the sport utility vehicles, pick-up trucks and minivans that form the group’s core business – has turned Mr Nardelli’s mission from a turnround into a rescue operation.Industry analysts are watching Chrysler less as a test of Wall Street’s ability to make US carmaking work than of Detroit’s ability to withstand a worst-case market scenario. The drama also marks a defining moment for Cerberus, which is also invested in the industry through its 51 per cent stake in GMAC, the financial institution formerly owned by General Motors and which is heavily exposed to the crumbling US housing market. Should it fail to turn the businesses around, the deals could become remembered as an object lesson in hubris at the tail-end of the past decade’s private equity boom.Chrysler no longer reports financial earnings, so the full extent of its problems can only be guessed at. But Mr Nardelli, who turned 60 last month, describes private ownership as a competitive advantage. He likens the new game at Chrysler to scoring a touchdown in American football rather than trying to charm judges in figure skating. “You deliver on the numbers, and nobody’s giving you style points,” he says.Instead of fretting over the stock market’s verdict on latest quarterly results, he says, he can concentrate on doing what he needs to engineer lasting profitability. If that means disposing of non-earning assets such as a Brazilian engine plant Chrysler sold in March to Fiat, he can do it swiftly and confidently, even if the sale is below book value.In an interview with the Financial Times, he asserts that Chrysler met or exceeded all of its objectives – including earnings, cash generation, shipments, and costs – for 2007, as well as in the first four months of this year. Chrysler’s cash position is “very close” to the $9bn (£4.6bn, €5.8bn) figure it says it had at end-2007, he says.But even without full disclosure, some of Chrysler’s numbers look dire. Sales of its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep marques plunged by 25 per cent in May from a year earlier – the worst month in recent memory for the US car market. Chrysler will not have a new small car on offer until 2010. While GM and Ford have promising new small-car projects, Chrysler’s biggest product launch this year is a revamped version of the Dodge Ram large pick-up truck.Industry sales of big pick-ups – among Chrysler’s best-selling and most profitable vehicles – were down by more than one-third in May. Mr Nardelli is not alone in calling this year in US carmaking a “perfect storm” but Chrysler, with the highest proportion of US and large vehicle sales of any Detroit producer, is being buffeted the hardest. As carmaking and financial services both weather their worst period in decades, Cerberus has postponed plans to merge GMAC with Chrysler’s financing arm. “It’s premature to discuss that now,” says Timothy Price, a director of the buy-out group. “That is a discussion for the future, when all this craziness in credit markets is over.”Cerberus maintains that its interest is long-term and Mr Price says Chrysler is beating every one of its targets except for revenues. However, some observers still believe Cerberus is trimming the company down to prepare it for a disposal, possibly by selling manufacturing assets to an overseas carmaker. “Chrysler’s extremely light product pipeline leads us to believe that [its] current owners do not have a long-term commitment to the business in its current form and it will most likely be broken up,” Merrill Lynch analysts asserted in a research report.Several people close to the company present a less than positive picture of the turnround, speaking of low morale among staff and fractious relations between Mr Nardelli and his two deputies, Tom LaSorda and Jim Press. “Nardelli is an autocratic person by nature,” says a banker who knows the company. “Everyone seems to listen to Jim most of the time.”The appointment of Mr Nardelli, a non-industry veteran, as Chrysler’s boss last August raised eyebrows in Detroit. He was a potential successor to Jack Welch at GE and doubled sales at Home Depot, but is perhaps best remembered for the $210m compensation package he collected when he left, which infuriated some of the retail chain’s shareholders. Rival carmaking executives are curious to see how he copes with managing a business where high fixed costs and fickle markets can see billions of dollars evaporate in a matter of months. “He is a sincere person but I don’t know whether he has all the experience needed to do this work,” one says. “This is the most complicated business there is.”Whatever his previous background, Chrysler’s boss speaks knowledgeably about such matters as improved coil springs on the new Ram and how its finish compares with Ford’s F-150. Mr Nardelli is also not the only outsider to take on a daunting turnaround in Detroit. Alan Mulally, formerly of Boeing, is doing the same at Ford.Messrs Nardelli, LaSorda and Press dismiss reports that they do not get along. Mr Nardelli ascribes the criticism to the triumvirate’s spontaneous style, which he contrasts with the culture under Daimler. “Really open discussion, open sharing of points of view, or Tom challenging me or Jim challenging Tom, might make some people uncomfortable in the room,” he says. “They’ve got to get over it.” Mr Press adds: “There’s nothing that we do that’s not consensus.” (Mr Nardelli declined the FT’s request to interview the three separately.)Without doubt, Mr Nardelli’s arrival and Chrysler’s new independence have fostered a bolder management style. Chrysler has been ahead of both Ford and GM this year in chopping its forecasts for the US car market. It then axed thousands of jobs and closed plants to match the lower projection. Mr Nardelli has shrunk the workforce from 77,500 to 65,800. He ditched four unprofitable models and slashed Chrysler’s inventory in half.The industry’s battle-hardened trade unions have taken notice. Buzz Hargrove, head of the Canadian Auto Workers, says his union decided not to make Chrysler the pattern-setting target in labour talks this year “because we sensed there would be a much tougher approach”.Decisions that in the past had to be channelled through Stuttgart and took weeks now take minutes; the move on inventories required a “five-minute call” to Cerberus, says Mr Nardelli. His team has also called on the expertise of the buy-out group’s 275-strong staff – many of them experienced former operating executives – when he needed to separate Chrysler’s information technology from Daimler’s after the split.Chrysler tapped into Cerberus’s expertise in hedging to design its “Let’s refuel America” promotion, which offers petrol to buyers of its vehicles at a fixed price of $2.99 a gallon, well below the market price of more than $4.Mr Press, recruited after a long career at Toyota, has been traversing the country to shore up its dealership network. He has organised “fireside chats” for groups of dealers and brainstormed on issues confronting them as they grapple with the reality of a much smaller Chrysler. “They’re more nimble now because they’re making decisions more quickly,” Sudhir Chopra, a Chrysler dealer in Toronto, says of the company’s management. “That is a huge difference.”Mr LaSorda, meantime, has scoured the globe for partnerships in promising markets such as Russia and India. One leg of that strategy is a joint venture with China’s Chery Automobile to make and export small cars from China. Chery is taking longer than expected to meet North American quality standards, a delay Mr LaSorda attributes to “bureaucracy”. Chrysler has turned to Nissan for help in producing a small car for North America – a key challenge for all Detroit carmakers.Mr Nardelli says he is seeking to restore a culture sapped by Chrysler’s years as Daimler’s US subsidiary. “I’m trying to re-establish all of the wonderful entrepreneurial spirit that existed from the Walter P. days,” he says, referring to the carmaker’s founder. To help in the effort, Mr Nardelli has turned to some former associates. John Campi, Home Depot’s former head of purchasing, has been brought out of retirement to cut supply costs by 25 per cent. Peter Arnell, an advertising man who also did work for Home Depot, is helping with marketing and brand strategies.But Chrysler has also seen some high-level departures including Jason Vines, head of communications. After clashing with Mr Nardelli, Mike Donoughe, regarded as one of its best engineers, left in March.Asked what he would have done differently in what is still his first year in the job, Mr Nardelli replies: “More, faster.” Despite talks with numerous other carmakers said to include Russia’s Gaz, India’s Mahindra & Mahindra and Italy’s Fiat Auto, Chrysler has yet to seal a big overseas deal that would ease its reliance on the US market.At least as urgent is the need to improve the design and quality of Chrysler’s vehicles. J.D. Power’s latest initial quality rankings, one of the industry’s most influential surveys, put Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler all well below average. Mr Nardelli and his colleagues note the survey was based on vehicles produced prior to the Cerberus takeover, when the German owners were squeezing costs. However, that defence will not hold water for much longer. Chrysler now needs successes on the Ram and a new generation of better quality, smaller vehicles.Given a shrinking market share, limited resources to invest and hints by Mr Nardelli that more cuts may lie ahead, outsiders question its ability to remain independent. “It’s too small and too truck-dependent and it needs a partner to survive,” says one former Chrysler executive.“They’re playing with an incomplete deck when it comes to being more competitive with Toyota and Honda,” says a Michigan industry consultant. “They’re competing with companies that have had a global mindset for two to three product cycles.”Mr Nardelli plays down the notion that Chrysler might seek an extensive tie-up along the lines of Nissan’s alliance with Renault. A suitor could also be hard to find, given the state of the US market. “We’re not looking for a wedding partner,” says Mr Nardelli. “We’re just dating right now – and it’s really nice being single in that regard.”Still, speculation persists that Cerberus will seek to cut its presumed losses and sell Chrysler. Given current markets an initial public offer is “not possible now”, says the banker close to Chrysler. The company could also be broken up, with the Jeep brand sold, possibly to an ambitious carmaker from Russia, India, or elsewhere. But Stephen Feinberg, Cerberus’s boss, is said to oppose seeing it sold to an overseas investor.Cerberus denies any immediate plans for a sale. “If someone comes along and offers us a great price, we would of course consider it, but we are not under pressure to sell any time soon,” says Mr Price, adding that Cerberus operates differently from traditional private equity funds. “We have investors who are in for the long haul,” he says. “We are not market timers.” Cerberus has “not sold a dime” of shares in Chrysler since the deal closed.Mr Nardelli and Mr Press report back to the Cerberus investors regularly, including a monthly phone call. Mr Nardelli says he has no plans to sell Jeep, which he describes as a “crown jewel” with a brand name as generic as Xerox or Kleenex. What is more, he contends, if Chrysler were on the margins of viability, Nissan would surely not have given it the go-ahead to produce light trucks for the Japanese carmaker from 2011. “That’s a big vote of confidence,” Mr Nardelli says.The Michigan consultant has a different perspective on the tie-up with Nissan, observing that it gives Carlos Ghosn, the Japanese group’s chairman, an opportunity to draw closer to Chrysler without making a predatory move. “It doesn’t cost him much to be the first in line,” says the consultant.Chrysler’s ability to dictate its future will be severely tested, with US demand expected to remain in the doldrums well into 2009. The cost benefits of a deal on healthcare costs agreed with the United Auto Workers are due to materialise only in 2010. A difficult year lies ahead.“We’ll keep trying to shape our future versus letting the future shape us,” says Mr Nardelli. Mr Chopra, the Toronto dealer, gives him and his team high marks for reinvigorating the organisation but confesses: “We are all very nervous. I don’t know whether they’ll ride it out.”THREE DECADES OF TWISTS AND TURNSCan Bob Nardelli do for Chrysler now what Lee Iacocca accomplished 30 years ago? Mr Iacocca became a US household name by leading a remarkable turnround at the carmaker during the late 1970s oil crisis.Several of the problems he faced are similar to those confronting Mr Nardelli. Then as now, Chrysler was under siege from more nimble Japanese competitors. Its line-up was skewed towards gas-guzzlers and production costs were high.Mr Iacocca took the wheel in 1978 after being Ford Motor’s president. He closed plants and shed thousands of Chrysler workers. Some of its least fuel-efficient cars were replaced with smaller models.Mr Iacocca came to personify Chrysler by appearing in television commercials using his signature line: “If you can find a better car, buy it.” The US government provided $1.5bn in loan guarantees and the recovery gathered speed to the point where Chrysler was able to repay those loans by 1983, years ahead of schedule.It expanded in 1987 by buying American Motors, owner of the Jeep brand. Chrysler was the target of a takeover attempt in 1995 by Kirk Kerkorian, the casino mogul, supported by Mr Iacocca. But their bid pushed it into the arms of Germany’s Daimler-Benz in 1998.For a while, the match seemed to work. The chunky Chrysler 300 sedan became a hot seller. But decisions grew slow and dealer relations tense.Mr Nardelli is less of a “car guy” than Mr Iacocca. He is also unlikely to find Washington help if Chrysler runs out of cash. But if he can pull off another turnround, he will be just as much celebrated in the industry."
274;HD;Home Depot;2008-06-02T20:06:58Z;Wal-Mart in challenge to Craigslist;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has launched a free classified ads service on its Walmart.com website in an alliance with Oodle.com, a small California start-up that is seeking to challenge the dominance of Craigslist.The listings on Walmart.com draw on its own users and hundreds of thousands of listings from Oodle’s other partners, including The Washington Post and Cox Media, and currently include a horse for sale for $400 in Stewart, Tennessee, a $5,500 Honda motorcycle in Burleson, Texas as well as houses and jobs.Wal-Mart is the first retailer to attempt to enter territory that was traditionally dominated by local US newspapers, which have been steadily losing ground during the past decade to online competitors.Craigslist currently has 30.3m unique users monthly, according to ComScore Media Metrix, while Oodle claims 5m. Walmart.com is the second-largest online retail site in the US after Amazon, with 29.3m unique users in April, according to ComScore.The retailer does not break out its online revenues but they are estimated by some industry observers to be in excess of $2bn annually.The new service comes as Walmart.com is seeking to increase the revenues generated on its retail website from paying advertisers, which currently include Vonnage, the phone company, and Netflix, the video rental company.The retailer’s online division, based in San Francisco, is recruiting a marketing director for online media, whose job will include developing Walmart.com’s “aggressive revenue goals” for its online ads so they “can deliver five times its current revenue levels within three years”.Walmart.com has joined Amazon.com in the past 18 months in making its home page available for other advertisers, a tactic that has also been explored by Home Depot and other US retailers.Walmart.com says the advertising makes a “substantial” contribution to its profits, without giving details.Oodle was launched in 2005 by a group of former executives from Excite and Ebay, and is headed by Craig Donato. Apart from Craigslist its rivals include Kijiji, a subsidiary of Ebay.Ravi Jariwala of Walmart.com said the new service would “provide additional opportunities for our customers to save money and live better” and would “further connect” with the retailer with its customers.Last year, Walmart.com formed a partnership to operate online customer reviews with Bazaarvoice. It also has a partnership with Triad Digital to provide information and background on a range of topics, such as health and diet.
275;HD;Home Depot;2008-05-20T20:51:07Z;Wall St hit by fears of prolonged credit crisis;;Wall Street stock markets were knocked off four-month highs on Tuesday after a rise in core inflation and record high oil prices threatened to trim corporate profits and a leading banking analyst said the credit crisis could extend well beyond 2009.The latest inflation figures gave a mixed picture of the price pressures on US businesses. Prices paid to producers in April, excluding food and fuel, rose twice as fast as forecast but a surprise decline in gasoline prices restrained overall increases to 0.2 per cent.Still, analysts said the trend was clear. “Inflation pressures are mounting and that is spooking the market,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “And of course record oil prices aren’t helping.”Crude prices pushed above $129 for the first time after billionaire investor T. Boone Pickens predicted oil could hit $150 and a number of analysts raised their price targets for 2008.The strains on the consumer of high fuel prices appear to be limited – so far. Home Depot joined the group of retailers who have posted first-quarter results that were not as bad as feared.The numbers were poor nonetheless. The home-improvement retailer said on Monday that net income slumped 66 per cent to $356m on revenue down 3.4 per cent to $17.9bn.Home Depot shares, which have lost about a quarter of their value in the last year, fell another 5.2 per cent to $27.37.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed the day down 0.9 per cent at 1,413.42 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.5 per cent lower at 12,828.68. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,492.26.On Monday US stocks pared gains in late trading but held on to close at their highest levels since early January after new data suggested that the US economy may skirt outright recession.Significant drag factors remain, foremost among which are the cascading effects of the credit crisis.According to Meredith Whitney and a team of analysts from Oppenheimer, the extended credit crisis will result in further multi-billion dollar revenue reversals at the major banks.“We believe the real harrowing days of the credit crisis are still in front of us and will prove more widespread in effect than anything yet seen,” Ms Whitney said.The culprit is less the writedowns themselves than the “shut-down” in the securitisation market which at its height provided 66 per cent of household borrowings in the first quarter of 2007.Without that market, consumer credit losses may be “far worse than what is currently estimated, even by the most draconian of investors”. Ms Whitney and her colleagues also slashed their 2008 earnings estimates for the large-cap banking stocks they cover by an average of 17 per cent.Financial stocks were among the leading fallers in the S&P 500, dropping 2.2 per cent while an index of investment banking shares also slumped 2.2 per cent.Morgan Stanley fell 3 per cent to $44.80, JPMorgan lost 5 per cent to $43.70 and Citigroup slipped 3.8 per cent to $22.11.Elsewhere, AIG, the insurer hit by massive subprime-related losses, said it would raise about 60 per cent more capital than it originally indicated in order to strengthen its balance sheet, knocking its share price 2.1 per cent to $38.12.On Tuesday, concerns about rising input costs, as well as a credit rating downgrade for a leading homebuilder, hurt the consumer discretionary sector in particular. The sector fell 1.6 per cent, led down by Centex and KB Home which lost 5.5 per cent to $21.81 and 5.5 per cent to $23.15 respectively.Amid the broader market malaise, energy was one of the few sectors to find any positive momentum. ConocoPhillips rose 0.9 per cent to $93.55, Chevron added 0.9 per cent to $103.09 and the broader sector climbed 0.8 per cent.After a strong run last week materials were largely flat on Tuesday, as rising gold prices weighed against analysts’ comments that weaker demand from China might result in soft metal prices. Newmont Mining rose 1.7 per cent to $49.88 but Alcoa fell 3.1 per cent to $43.23.Packaging stocks were also hit by a number of analyst downgrades. Sealed Air deflated, falling 4.4 per cent to $23.96 while Bemis dropped 4.1 per cent to $26.45.
276;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
277;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Slowdown hits Target and Home Depot;;Home Depot and Target, two of the largest US retailers, illustrated the regional nature of pressures on US consumers Tuesday, as they announced quarterly falls in sales and increasing pressures on credit.Target, the mass discounter, reported an increase in write-offs in its credit card portfolio to a 7.6 per cent annualised rate, from 6 per cent last year. Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer, said the problems were focused in Florida, California, Arizona and Nevada, states that have been particularly hard hit by the housing slowdown.“Our adverse experience in delinquencies, and our adverse experience in write-offs is very heavily concentrated in those four states,” which account for 30 per cent of the retailer’s overall credit card receivables.Frank Blake, chief executive of Home Depot, said the home improvement retailer’s stores in California and Florida remained most heavily hit by the housing slowdown.“It is hard to see a lot of improvement there. We’ve got other areas that have been relatively strong that have declined a bit,” he said, while pointing to continued relative strength in markets in Texas and the Midwest.Home Depot’s shares fell more than 5 per cent in New York, after it warned its full-year results would be at the lower end of its previously forecast decline of earnings between 19 and 24 per cent.For the first quarter, it reported a sharp fall in profits to $356m, or 21 cents a share, including a $543m one-off charge, linked to its decision to close 15 stores and to abandon plans for around 50 more.Excluding the charge, earnings were still down 22 per cent on the same quarter last year, as total sales fell 3.4 per cent to $17.9bn. Comparable sales at its US stores fell 8.4 per cent.Target reported a 7.5 per cent decline in quarterly profit to $602m, as sales grew 5 per cent to $14.3bn, as customers opted for lower margin basics and food products. Target focuses on a more up-market customer base than its larger rival Wal-Mart and has been harder hit by the pressures on US consumers.Gregg Steinhafel, who succeeded Bob Ulrich as CEO this year, said Target still expected low-level growth in sales throughout the remainder of the year and was committed to its goal of opening 80 to 100 new stores a year.Target said it was focusing on effectively controlling its inventory to respond to the the slowdown in demand, and on reducing operating expenses.Separately, Staples, the largest US office supplies retailer, reported a 6 per cent fall in quarterly sales at its US stores open at least a year, although international sales helped its total sales to increase 6 per cent to $4.9bn.Ron Sargeant, CEO, said the 6 per cent drop in US same-store sales illustrated that “monthly trend is bad, bad, and bad’’. But he expressed guarded optimism.“I do feel like we’re in the trough and the general direction is up from here.’’Staples on Monday launched a $2.34bn hostile bid for Corporate Express, the Dutch office supply retailer.
278;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Home Depot cuts back plans for growth;;Home Depot, the second-largest US retailer, is again to scale down its US growth plans, continuing a trend that has also seen Wal-Mart and Starbucks cut back on store opening plans in response to increasing market saturation.The home improvement retailer, which operates almost 2,000 stores across the US, says it will slow its annual sq ft growth to 1.5 per cent, adding 20 to 30 new US stores annually – that is, less than a third of its growth rate in 2007. Frank Blake, chief executive, characterised the decision as a response to investor concerns about return on capital rather than as a short-term response to the slump in the home improvement market.“This is a continuation of our disciplined approach to capital allocation that we outlined last year,” he said in a statement.Two years ago, Mr Blake’s predecessor, Bob Nardelli, outlined plans for Home Depot to add 80 to 90 stores a year until 2011, which already represented a reduction from the 180 stores a year that it was opening in the first years of the decade.As part of a review of its real estate, the company is to close 15 underperforming stores. It will also abandon 50 planned US store locations, some of which have been in its pipeline for more than 10 years, recording a $400m charge for development costs.Home Depot said spending on new stores will be reduced by about $1bn during the next three years.Mr Blake had already reduced capital spending on new stores to $2.3bn this year, from $3.6bn last year, with 36 new stores planned for the US and 19 in Canada and Mexico.The strategy reflects decisions by other retail icons that expanded rapidly in the 1990s against a background of strong US economic growth. Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said last year that it would slow its US store expansion amid similar investor concerns about returns on investment.Starbucks, the global coffee chain, is also to cut planned US store openings as part of a broad effort by Howard Schultz, chief executive, to improve performance. The company said on Wednesday it would slow its US opening plans to 400 a year for the next three years, down from 1,020 this year.
279;HD;Home Depot;2008-04-20T20:51:50Z;Sector analysis: Asia and technology leading the way;;"The key trends in this year’s Brandz Top 100 rankings – the strength of leading technology and mobile communications brands, the power of innovation, the rise of Asian and especially Chinese brands – all emerge in this detailed look at 16 business categories.This year, insurance companies have been given their own category rather than being lumped in with other financial institutions. Some additional research in laundry care (fabric detergent and fabric softener/conditioner) and deodorants has covered some of the brands in the category. Spirits is an entirely new category and gives fresh insight into the performance of companies such as Diageo, which owns five of the Top 10 brands.The following is an edited version of the Brandz sectoral findings, with additional comments for the fastest-growing categories, and the two new ones, from Joanna Seddon, chief executive of Millward Brown Optimor, Peter Walshe, director of the Brandz programme at MBO, and Anna Chen, associate director.Apparel• There is an increased link between sport and lifestyle, leading to a smaller distinction between sports and regular apparel brands – many consumers are wearing more sportswear, but not participating in more sports activities.• The sporting goods industry has benefited from global sporting events such as the World Cup and the forthcoming Beijing Olympics, which have placed the industry in the limelight. In China, rising disposable incomes and interest in western sporting events have created an opportunity for western sports brands.• Retailers are placing more focus on online channels as more and more consumers turn to e-retailing.Brand highlights: Ralph Lauren is seeking better control over its products to maintain its prestigious brand image, and has seen strong demand for its “collection” products.Esprit is the one brand from this category to feature in the overall list of top 20 risers. It has not deviated from its original aim, says Ms Chen – focusing on affordable, casual clothing that is not overly trendy and thus likely to fall out of fashion quickly. Esprit is also a relatively rare example of a global mass market brand, says Ms Seddon – while others such as Zara and H&M are still becoming global.Beer• In the west, smoking bans, shrinking core markets and a widening choice of alternative alcoholic beverages have conspired to stunt the growth of the beer market, although the 2006 World Cup and a spate of unusually hot weather have softened the blow.• Companies are increasing their focus on emerging markets.• Domestic beers in developed markets face stagnant volumes while imported premium brands see strong growth.• In the US, a preference for imported premium beers and for healthier options has boosted the “luxury imported light” category,with sales almost twice those of imported regular beers.• There has been consolidation in the brewing industry as companies seek to secure brands and national positions as well as broaden global footprints.Brand highlights: Skol’s results come from long-term brand renovation work and significant outreach to young men. The Stella Artois brand grew beyond the UK, with good results in North America and eastern Europe. For Beck’s, innovative products such as Beck’s Green Lemon have helped refresh the brand image and attract interest.Cars• The strong brands benefit from cool new designs, fuel efficient and green models in an environment where gas prices are rising.• Recent business conditions have been characterised by increases in crude oil and raw materials prices, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and structural changes in demand.• Development was influenced by dynamic growth in the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America, whereas the traditional car markets (US, Japan and western Europe) recorded zero or negative growth.Brand highlights: Porsche capitalised on the success of the previous fiscal year in the Middle East, Latin America and southern and eastern Europe. Fiat’s revenues reached a record high, due to the success of the Punto, Panda, Bravo and light commercial vehicles.Coffee• The global coffee market has experienced slow but positive sales growth, leading to good results for most brands.• A big characteristic is innovation and movement towards quality/premium products.• Fair trade sales have significantly increased.• Nestlé and Kraft dominate instant coffees and the whole category as a result.• Consumers are turning to ground coffee and/or stopping consumption of instant coffee.Brand highlights: Nespresso has capitalised on the success of the previous fiscal year in the Middle East, Latin America and southern and eastern Europe. The brand is leading the “premium” trend because it is positioned as almost a luxury coffee – sold only at top department stores and its own “boutiques”. So the product can be sold at a relatively high price.Fast Food• Consumers are returning to fast-food restaurants as efforts to revamp the industry’s image through healthier and better quality offerings pay off.• Growth in the number of outlets is forecast to slow down as operators focus on maximising sales from existing stores with later hours and increased menu variety.• Asia offers great opportunity for fast food operators to expand. Western fast-food brands hold an aspirational status and are regarded as a treat.• Coffee houses have reached a level of maturity in leading markets, which means that profits are substantial but not as large as early 2000.• Competition is also increasing as major retailers have or are developing their own-brand coffee shops.Brand highlights: The category was the fastest overall riser in the previous year’s rankings and is still doing well. McDonald’s and Burger King remain the sector’s “Yin and Yang” in terms of strategy, as Ms Seddon puts it, yet have both recorded big rises in brand value. Meanwhile KFC’s “new fast food” positioning in China has strengthened the brand’s No 1 position, far outstripping McDonald’s.Apart from Wendy’s, the one brand whose value declined, by 25.2 per cent, was Starbucks. This partly reflects the decline in the “business value” element of the calculation and the fact that the brand has fallen from its peak position.But MBO’s experts point out that Starbucks’ “brand contribution” is still rising and the brand remains fundamentally strong.Howard Schultz, the chairman and founder who this year returned to the post of chief executive, is given credit by Ms Seddon for realising early that the company, in its dash for growth, may be losing something essential to the brand – the “smell of fresh coffee in the stores”.Financial Institutions• Many US and British banks have been affected by the subprime crisis.• Chinese banks have had two big years but it is hard to tell how much of their performance is due to better management and how much to the exceptionally favourable economic conditions.• To maintain a competitive edge, banks need to both provide a service that clients perceive as being personalized and focus on a specific area rather than a wide range of functions.• Leading banks and financial services companies are making proactive attempts to be more “green”.Brand highlights: The impact of last summer’s credit squeeze can be seen in the declines or small rises in brand value for Citi, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, whereas Goldman Sachs, up 45 per cent, is benefiting from taking a contrarian line to its rivals. “They saw the credit crunch coming and actually bet against the subprime mortgage market,” says Ms Seddon.Citi’s 10 per cent decline in brand value has allowed Bank of America to claim top spot. Mr Walshe notes that 10 years ago, Bank of America hardly registered as a brand, but that acquisitions, rebranding and “shouting about what it is and where it stands in the marketplace”, have made a big impact.The inexorable rise of the Chinese banks is also charted by the Brandz rankings, with ICBC, China Construction Bank and Bank of China all achieving big rises in brand value. Standard Chartered Bank benefits from its presence in Asia. The increases would have been greater if MBO had not adjusted for the so-called “Shanghai bubble” on stock markets last year, which would have given an inflated overall view of the banks’ brand value.Insurance• Leading insurance companies are positioning themselves for a future that requires significant changes in the way they do business (unprecedented volatility, a changing customer base and exacting regulators).• New markets will help drive profits, as developed economies see slower growth in demand for insurance.• Insurers collectively spent $2bn last year on advertising, surpassing the beer, entertainment and soft drink industries.Brand highlights: The Aviva brand (a new entry) is not used in the UK, where it trades as Norwich Union. Net income increased 26 per cent with special help from the UK and the Netherlands, acquisitions and rapidly growing organic start-ups.Axa’s net income rose significantly, including the acquisition of Winterthur, the former insurance arm of Credit Suisse. Axa wants to address eroded confidence in the sector.Luxury• The global value of the market is around $400bn and it is tipped to grow to $2,000bn by 2010.• There are emerging consumers for “New Luxury” items, products and services that deliver higher levels of quality, taste, and aspiration than conventional ones.• Luxury brands prefer to use standard advertising and marketing formats as they have concerns that interruptive formats have a negative impact on their brand.• There is pressure even for luxury brands to be environmentally responsible. A report by WWF, the conservation organisation, criticised the luxury products industry as being “slow to recognise their responsibilities and opportunities”.• Recently luxury brands have been entering the leisure/construction industries, exporting lifestyle brands to hotels and apartments.Brand highlights: The solid rises in brand value, from an already high base, attest to the importance of innovation – and making a splash about it. “It’s about constantly coming up with something new and creating a buzz around the brands, and all these brands are very good at that,” says Ms Seddon. Consistent application of brand management principles has resulted in very similar brand value increases across the LVMH brands – Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon and Hennessy. Yet LVMH is a true “house of brands”, says Ms Seddon – each is managed separately and synergies are not exploited because this could have a long-term impact on the share price and the success of the brand. “It’s the opposite of some of the car companies, who make the same chassis for all their cars and just stick different top pieces on it,” she says. “There is no same car under different labels here. The employees stay within one brand, they don’t jump from one to another, so they live the principles of the brand.”Elsewhere, Gucci has branched away from the conservative approach typical of brands in this category through the creation of a strong online corporate identity, allowing it to stand out among competitors.Mobile Operators• Mobile phones are ubiquitous, so network operators are focused on getting customers to spend more.• The biggest influence on the growth of the market has been the advent of 3G technology, which enables facilities such as video calling and game downloads.• The liberalisation of the telecommunications sector has led to price pressure.• As markets approach saturation point, providers are focusing on strengthening existing customer relationships. At the European level, competition is increasing because of the introduction of Europe-wide services.Brand highlights: Vodafone, Movistar and Orange are expanding globally from bases in smaller markets, while China Mobile has built a very strong brand in one huge market. “It’s a premium-priced brand, unlike its competitors, and it is not just big,” says Ms Seddon. “It is also very much being developed, positioned and marketed as a brand, as opposed to just a product or service.”O2, now part of Telefónica, is maintaining its brand personality, standing for solidity, globalisation and innovation while reinventing itself through marketing efforts such as sponsoring the England rugby team.MTS is the first Russian company to reach the BrandZ Top 100, coming in at 89th.Motor Fuel• Brands are globalising, as is shown by the expansion not only of the BP brand, but also the recent appearance of the Lukoil brand in retail petrol in the US and other markets.• Companies are trying to manage the difficult balancing act of promoting a “green” agenda and sustainability in a credible manner.• The strategic focus for the companies remains on upstream and refining activities – brand-building is at the bottom of the agenda.Brand highlights: PetroChina’s consolidated turnover increased 24.8 per cent and consolidated net profit rose 6.6 per cent.Personal Care• In all areas of the personal care market, products offering additional properties to simply cleaning have been booming (for example, skin-firming for face, whitening for teeth or curl-enhancing for hair).• As manufacturers have extended their offerings, brands have shifted consumer perceptions so that these products are now viewed as beauty products and not simply as toiletries.• A big trend in the sector is the rise of spa-influenced products, which command price premiums.Brand highlights: The sector has some very strong brands that continue to grow, says Mr Walshe. The biggest riser is Nivea. Innovation underlies the strength of the top brands, he says – but this may not necessarily be in the products themselves. “There’s a feeling of communications innovation, which gives you a sense of dynamism about the brand and why, therefore, it’s worth buying it and being seen to use it.”A further point is that brands with a “premium feel” to them, if not actually luxury brands, are doing well. Lancôme and Shiseido, which has expanded beyond Japan, are examples.Unlike in other categories, no strong indigenous brands have yet developed in emerging Asian markets, attesting to the international brands’ marketing and distribution clout and their recognisability.In deodorants, Axe is now the number one deodorant in the US, with strong double-digit growth. The “Axe effect” – giving men the edge in the dating game – underpins all the brand’s campaigns. Branding and marketing is very similar for Lynx, as the Unilever product is called in the UK, Ireland and Australia.Dove associated its deodorant with positive skincare credentials, and positioned it more as a beauty product than a functional one, which helped to increase penetration and achieve a double-digit increase in turnover.Retailing• The race to capture the green moral high ground has gone into overdrive.• Grocery retailers are moving into non-traditional business areas such as digital media services, marking a new position as providers of lifestyle products.• There has been significant growth in online retailing as consumers seek more convenient ways to shop. Many retailers have enhanced multi-channel offers to give a more flexible service.• In line with the trend towards healthy eating, retailers are increasingly displaying nutrition labels on products.Brand highlights: At Amazon, increased product offerings and new initiatives not only improved financial performance but also helped to refresh the brand with consumers.“There is one internet retail success story and this is it,” says Ms Seddon. “It’s about focusing on ease of use and involving the consumer.”They reach out to you by saying: “What books do you want to buy this week? We think you might be interested in this.” At Tesco, meanwhile, the introduction of more healthy foods boosted sales. Wider product choice and a flexible delivery system led to a 30 per cent increase in Tesco.com revenues as consumers seek more convenient ways to shop.At Home Depot in the US, the slowdown in the home improvement market resulted in a decrease of comparable store sales of 4.6 per cent; increasing labour and store costs also reduced profitability.Soft Drinks• The sector is struggling to sustain growth as an unhealthy image drives down consumption of soft drinks, while juices and water are claiming market share. Unsurprisingly, the low-calorie category is faring best.• The sector is dominated by a handful of superbrands and strong promotional support will ensure that the sector continues to grow, even if it is at a slower rate.• Events such as the football World Cup provided good opportunities for marketing, while the sector continues to embrace the web to reach a youthful audience, particularly in the form of websites for music downloading or video uploading.• The inclusion of bottling has boosted business value for all brands.Spirits• The European beverage sector is trading at a higher relative valuation than for more than a decade.• The US market continues to deliver growth in the premium segments.• Emerging markets are increasingly important to profitability and have shown accelerating sales.• Growth in the spirits market is coming from “premiumisation”. Many brands are trying to innovate and extend brands upwards.• Brands have faced greater advertising restrictions, especially around the issue of linking sex to alcohol and responsibility among younger drinkers.Brand highlights: The most valuable spirits brand, Hennessy, is not on the list as it is in the luxury category. Innovations include new flavours to add pizzazz to he big base brands, according to Ms Seddon. Bacardi is a good example with additional flavours to complement the core white rum.Elsewhere, Smirnoff relaunched its Smirnoff Black Label at the premium end of the market and emphasised its copper-pot distillation method.Johnnie Walker has harnessed tremendous growth as a result of price increases, additional investment, a focus on premiumisation and success in Latin America and Asia.Jack Daniels has been boosting market share through a super-premium offer recently redirected at younger drinkers, with a strong bias towards males.Technology• This is a rapidly evolving market driven by technological advancements available at a cheaper price. At the same time, the industry is experiencing a new wave, led by Apple, of sophisticated premium-priced products that command higher margins for design, functionality and trendiness.• The majority of brands have minimal product differentiation and are jostling for a position in the market.• Microsoft is still king in the software category.• The mobile handset category is still growing fast, especially in the Latin American and Asian markets as mobile phones become more affordable.• Apple’s iPhone is having a powerful impact.• After several years of moving at a healthy pace, the search engine industry seems to be sailing off in new directions.• There has been a recent surge of selling and buying of web businesses in which lofty sums are being paid.• The internet has become a principal medium for community, communication, and entertainment – three areas that have collided and are impacting each other’s growth.Brand highlights: Google, leading the Top 100 ranking again, continues to expand its business into different areas: it acquired Double- Click, a vibrant advertising business for banners, videos, and other so-called display ads, and launched an open operating system for mobile phones (free to use), called Android, promising “better, cheaper” mobile phones.BlackBerry and Apple had the biggest rises in brand value for the Top 100.Two other strong performers in the category were: IBM (up 64.8 per cent) which benefited from continued growth in emerging markets, improved cost competitiveness and utilisation levels, and ongoing productivity initiatives. And Siemens, up 61 per cent, had strong financial results throughout the year, powered by multiple acquisitions and strategic alliances. This year, however, has brought a shock €900m ($1,400bn) profit warning that it blamed on a contract cancellation, project delays and capacity issues.Nokia benefited from big year-on-year increases in sales in Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Two company acquisitions during 2007 and four in 2006 have improved process integration and quality, resulting in greater customer loyalty and profitability.According to Mr Walshe, Nokia’s relationship with its customers, already strong 10 years ago, has become even closer. The company’s 38.9 per cent rise in brand value reflects a resurgence after rivals stole a march on it in the clamshell phone market.But Mr Walshe says that “the relationship people have got with the Nokia brand is putting the company in a strong position, so if it ever got out of synch with the product cycle, as can sometimes happen with technology companies, it would be better placed to recover than others”.Bottled Water• While bottled water is thriving as a healthy alternative to carbonated soft drinks, a rise in the environmental consciousness of consumers has put the industry in the spotlight.• Commoditisation and a lack of brand and product differentiation have caused the ”brand contribution” to drop across the category.• Still water has continued to outsell sparkling, with flavoured variants from the big brands thriving.Brand highlights: Perrier has revived its exclusive image, and with its distinctive green bottle, is one of the most recognisable bottled water brands.Volvic, the top brand in the UK, is continuing its positioning as a water for the younger consumer with its “Volcanicity” campaign."
280;HD;Home Depot;2008-04-20T20:51:50Z;Holding firm as downturn looms;;The past year was, like the years immediately preceding it, a good time to build a brand. Strong economic growth around the world and rising income in countries such as India and China provided fertile conditions for many companies to boost the value of their products.The world’s top 100 brands increased in value by 21 per cent to a total of $1,940bn. They were buoyed not only by strong growth in many countries and industries but by a willingness to invest heavily in the brands that distinguish their products.The boom in luxury goods and services over the past 10 years has given this trend an impetus. Brands such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton have expanded globally, taking advantage of demand not only in Japan but now in China, India and Russia.By the year-end, however, problems had appeared. Neither Bear Stearns or Northern Rock had been in the top 100 but both lost huge amounts of value amid the credit crunch. Weakening economic growth – and a possible recession – in the US also took a less dramatic toll on brands such as Starbucks and Wal-Mart.So, in 2008, many brands will face a tougher climate. Those in the Brandz Top 100 Most Powerful Brands ranking must hope that Nigel Hollis, chief global analyst for Millward Brown, the consultancy that compiles the rankings, is right that they are in a comparatively strong position.“Strong brands are far better positioned than others to ride out recessions. The ones that perform best are those that invest during downturns because, as the recessions ends, they come out stronger,” he says.The downturn will test that proposition, which is a tenet of advertising and marketing companies such as WPP Group, the parent of Millward Brown.Brands have long been a mainstay of consumer companies. “A vodka salesman may have a good reputation but his successor generally does just as well if the label on the bottle is Smirnoff,” says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of Intangible Business, a UK consultancy.But the early 21st century has been notable for the new brands industries that have sprung up. The clearest examples are in communications, with brands such as Research in Motion’s BlackBerry – the fastest growing brand this year – coming to the fore.Six of the top 10 most valuable global brands (seven if you include General Electric) are in the technology or telecoms industries. Both Nokia and Apple, which now produces the iPhone, rose enough places in the rankings this year to enter the top 10.The number one place in the rankings was taken once again by Google, which retained its two-spot edge over its rival Microsoft. “Google has delivered something that speaks to people in the modern age, the ability to get information quickly and easily,” says Mr Hollis.Apple, the second fastest growing brand of the year, still thrives under the leadership of Steve Jobs, its co-founder. Mr Jobs has shown how a brand can be built with superior technology, smart design, strong advertising and strong customer service at its own-name stores.Yet the growth of mobile telephony, which has been such a strong influence on brand value, already shows signs of waning. Some markets have reached full penetration and the economic uncertainty is having a direct impact on phone sales.Brands in technology and telecoms could now face a period of competition with each other. That has already been the experience of consumer goods comp­anies – and restaurants such as Starbucks, which dropped 21 places this year as American consumers became jaded.Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ founder, has now taken over as chief executive to revive its fortunes. He could take note of the rise of McDonald’s, which went through a similar downturn but has been reviving and entered the top 10 at number eight.Retailers and makers of packaged goods continue to tussle for the consumer’s loyalty. Retailers such as Tesco in the UK and Whole Foods Market in the US not only control their shelf space zealously but also sell white label versions of branded goods.US retailers had a tough year, with Wal-Mart and Home Depot both falling in the rankings, but Tesco continued to rise. Coca-Cola retained its fourth position in the rankings, while the brands Tide and Ariel were counted in the rankings for the first time.Financial services companies – and particularly banks and investment banks – were already facing tough conditions in 2007. Merrill Lynch, which was badly affected by the sub-prime credit crisis, dropped 24 places, losing 16 per cent of its brand value.“It has been a very scary year from a brand perspective because we have seen a couple of names – Northern Rock and Bear Stearns – disappear. That is pretty rare and it shows how vulnerable banks are to their reputations being impaired,” says Mr Forbes.The outlook is less troubled for brands in Asia – and in particular what Millward Brown calls “modern” rather than “traditional” Asia – mainland China rather than Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong – from where brands have emerged in the past.This year, there are four mainland Chinese companies in the top 100 – China Mobile and three Chinese banks. They have joined seven traditional Asian brands, including Standard Chartered Bank and Toyota, but have already overtaken them in value.Wally Olins, chairman of Saffron brand consultants, argues that India and China are only tapping the surface of their ability to create global brands. He cites the development by the Indian company Tata of the Nano – the “one lakh” small car – as a sign of things to come.“India and China are going to emerge very powerfully and are moving to become global. We will see examples of big brands that come from places we did not consider at all seriously before.”Mr Hollis, however, has doubts about how fast this will occur, and how many Asian brands will succeed on the global stage. “It is incredibly hard for a brand that has been a success in one country to make an impact outside. It happens only rarely,” he says.Recognising this, Asian companies are showing interest in acquiring western brands to which they can apply their manufacturing expertise, such as Lenovo’s purchase of IBM’s personal computer business.The uncertain economic climate could make this easier for Asian companies, particularly if a sharp US downturn does not derail growth in China and India. But it could also inhibit them from expanding out of domestic markets and entering softer US and European economies.Indeed, 2008 is likely to be a challenging year for many brands that have become used to expanding rapidly. It could be a particular test for the newer brands that have established themselves in consumers’ minds in a relatively short period.These rising stars have not yet been through a downturn and had to cope with hard choices about how much to continue to invest in marketing and branding. The advice of branding experts is to stick the course but we shall see whether they have the nerve.
281;HD;Home Depot;2008-03-27T09:34:17Z;Pay package polls;;Had shareholders been able to vote on compensation plans at UnitedHealth, Home Depot or Gillette, would those companies’ former chief executives be living in smaller mansions? Perhaps. Support is growing for “say-on-pay” rules to give US shareholders a non-binding vote on the propriety of executive pay schemes.Video rental chain Blockbuster, whose chief executive stepped down last year after a pay-related struggle with Carl Icahn, has just adopted a say-on-pay provision. Aflac and Verizon adopted similar plans last year. It is likely many US companies will agree to similar provisions unless Congress, which is already debating the issue, beats them to it by making such votes mandatory.Boardrooms worry it will give rabble-rousing activists too much power, emasculate compensation committees and make it tougher to hire and retain top executives. But the provision’s bark will probably be worse than its bite. That is the point.The mere existence of an advisory vote should serve as a deterrent to boards thinking of approving exorbitant compensation packages. For boards that adequately tie pay to performance, say-on-pay provisions should unearth minimal opposition. In the UK, where non-binding votes are largely required, proxy services have advised shareholders to oppose compensation plans at roughly one-tenth of all listed companies, according to Yale’s Millstein Center for Corporate Governance.That may seem high to boards that have seen shareholders muscle their way into the corporate decision-making process in recent years. But how big a step would these provisions really represent? Activists have not exactly held their tongues over pay packages they feel are egregious. The issue may provide political fodder. But these provisions should prove problematic only for the very companies that really need to be hampered by them.Post and read comments on this Lex
282;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Chrysler on road to profitability, says CEO;;Chrysler is on track to return to profitability within the next couple of years in spite of the worsening US economy, according to Bob Nardelli, the chief executive of the Detroit-based carmaker.Unlike some other executives in the motor industry, Mr Nar­delli sees little chance of an improvement in the market during the second half of this year, projecting sales of about 15.5m cars and light trucks, down from 16.1m in 2007. Nonetheless, he told the Financial Times: “We’re on the appropriate slope to deliver to our investors in spite of the economic headwinds.“With that trajectory in the next couple of years [profitability] will be achieved,” he added.Chrysler lost $1bn in 2006 and has estimated last year’s losses at $1.6bn. It beat its 2007 forecast and ended the year with cash reserves of $1bn more than it had projected before last year’s acquisition by Cerberus Capital Manage­ment, the private equity group.“We took a very aggressive, conservative view heading into 2008,” Mr Nardelli said.Chrysler projects industry sales next year at 15.5m to 16m vehicles, but expects to refine its forecast around mid-year. Mr Nardelli and other Chrysler executives also said that the carmaker is looking for a new partner to make small cars for its core north American market.It is continuing a joint venture with China’s Chery Automobile, signed in late 2006, which was initially due to fill the small-car gap in Chrysler’s portfolio. But Chery is taking longer than expected to meet north American and west European quality standards, with the result that vehicles from the partnership will be sold only in emerging markets.Japan’s Nissan agreed in January to use surplus capacity at a plant in Mexico to build Dodge-branded cars based on its small Versa saloon for some Latin American countries. The deal has ignited speculation that Chrysler could also turn to Nissan for help in the US and Canada.In a separate interview with the FT, Mr Nardelli admitted he might have made mistakes during his tenure as chief executive of Home Depot. He left the retailer last January after a bruising battle with shareholders who had criticised his pay, his perceived inability to communicate with Wall Street at a time of share price under-performance, and some strategic moves.“There is a saying: ‘people who do things make mistakes, they never make the biggest mistake of all: doing nothing’,” he said, adding that he was proud of his achievements at Home Depot, where he improved profits and sales.
283;HD;Home Depot;2008-02-28T00:36:59Z;Toll Bros suffers biggest loss since 1986;;"Toll Brothers, the largest US luxury builder, on Wednesday became the latest company to paint a gloomy picture of the housing market for this year, reporting its deepest loss since going public in 1986.Home Depot and Lowe’s, the home improvement retailers, have both reported lower profits this week and offered little hope of an imminent recovery in the market.Robert Toll, the company’s founder and chief executive, echoed this sentiment, saying the critical spring home-selling season was likely to offer little relief to the beleaguered industry.New home sales in January fell to their lowest since 1995, according to figures out on Wednesday.“The selling season, which we believe starts in mid-January, has been weak for the third year in a row,” said Mr Toll. “Only when customers believe we are done with housing deflation will the excess supply clear and the market return to equilibrium.”Fears of recession were helping to keep buyers out of the market, Mr Toll added. “We believe this drumbeat, coupled with concerns over mortgages, the direction of home prices and foreclosures, has kept pent-up demand on the sidelines,” he said.The company fell to a $96m (£48m) loss during the first quarter, compared with a $54m profit in the same period last year. The loss per share was 61 cents, below analysts’ expectations of a 50 cent loss. Toll’s only other quarterly loss since going public was in the previous quarter, when the company lost $82m.The loss was driven by $246m in pre-tax writedowns on land, at the upper end of the range forecast.Michael Rehaut, an analyst at JPMorgan, said the weak start to the selling season and the constrained consumer demand would lead to yet lower prices and further impairments for builders.He said some builders were being offered only 30-40 per cent of the value of land on their books as they sought to dispose of assets and raise cash.Revenues for the quarter were down 23 per cent at $843m, and signed contracts were down 38 per cent, at 904 homes, both in line with the sales preview revealed at the beginning of February.“We believe Toll will need to continue to aggressively reduce backlog prices to sell excess inventory,” said Anna Torma, an analyst at Soleil Securities.Mr Toll said it did see “a few glimmers of hope” in the Naples, Florida, area and suburban Washington DC. In Naples, he said, between March 2006 and late last year “it seemed as though we couldn’t give away a home there”. In Washington, Mr Toll said, “we have seen the glimmer before and it faded; perhaps this time it won’t”.Shares in Toll Brothers closed up 3.07 per cent at $23.83."
284;HD;Home Depot;2008-02-26T19:58:45Z;Home Depot forecasts challenging year;;"Home Depot, the second-largest US retailer after Wal-Mart, painted a gloomy picture of the coming financial year and described 2007 as “one of the most difficult years ever”.The retailer is forecasting 2008 total sales to be down 4-5 per cent and earnings per share to be down 19-24 per cent.Frank Blake, chief executive, said: “We expect 2008 to be another challenging year in terms of the housing and home improvement markets. There is a substantial inventory of houses for sale; continued pressure on housing prices; uncertainties around credit availability; and concerns around the overall economy beyond the housing sector.”Home Depot also reduced its planned capital expenditure by about a third to $2.3bn for 2008 and said it would open only 35 stores in the US, down from 78 last year. The retailer also said it would rethink large store remodelling projects.Mr Blake said Home Depot had continued to lose market share since he took over from Bob Nardelli in January last year. But he said the rate of loss was slowing as the retailer launched a series of initiatives aimed at improving its stores.“We don’t feel like we’re picking up share yet. We’re on that trajectory, but we’re not there yet,” he said.The retailer’s grim view of the market echoed the concerns of Lowe’s, its main rival, which said on Monday that it would not see any significant improvements in the housing market until 2009.Carol Tome, Home Depot chief financial officer, said: “The back half of the year should be a bit better than the front half – still negative, still down. And we are hoping that there’s improvement in 2009.”Home Depot’s earnings fell 27 per cent during its fourth quarter to $671m, or 40 cents per diluted share, on sales of $17.7bn. Net sales for the full year fell more than 2 per cent to $77bn.Reports from other leading US retailers underlined the broad pressures on the US consumer as a result of the housing slowdown and credit squeeze.Target, the discount retailer, reported an 8 per cent fall in fourth-quarter earnings to $1.03bn, or $1.23 per diluted share. This contrasted with the 4 per cent earnings increase reported by rival Wal-Mart this month.Target’s sales were up less than 1 per cent at $19.9bn. The retailer said it was not forecasting any improvement in macroeconomic factors for the year ahead. It said comparable store sales growth would be 2-3 per cent for the year.Meanwhile, Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, said it expected its 2008 comparable sales to range between a 1 per cent decline and a 1.5 per cent increase.The retailer said it had registered weaker-than-expected sales in the fourth quarter but managed to beat Wall Street’s expectations with earnings per share of $1.65, supported by stronger gross margins."
285;HD;Home Depot;2008-02-18T18:09:28Z;US retailers hope for tax boost;;For beleaguered US retailers struggling with slowing consumer demand, relief could be on the way in the form of an estimated $42.9bn spending boost from federal tax rebates, aimed at steering the US away from recession.According to a survey of more than 7,000 people for the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend about 40 per cent of the extra $105.7bn due in rebates that will start arriving in May. A further $30bn will be used to pay down debt, $19.8bn will be saved and the remainder either invested or used to pay for medical bills.However, for retailers and consumer goods companies, much will depend on whether consumers choose to spend the extra money on food and low-margin basics, or on discretionary purchases, such as home goods, electronics and toys.Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup, has said she expects the rebates to deliver a “one-time jolt” to consumer spending. But she told clients that “we expect most consumers who decide to spend their cheques to purchase lower- margin food and consumables” rather than discretionary items.In an indication of the state of lower-income consumers, Wal-Mart said that, in January, its customers were using Christmas gift cards to pay for food and other basics, rather than buy discretionary goods.Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, and other discounters are expected to offer free cheque cashing facilities for rebate cheques, and they are likely to be prime beneficiaries of the extra spending. Citigroup says that, in 2001, about 25 per cent of a similar round of rebate cheques were spent at Wal-Mart.But if the large discounters – Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target – seem well-positioned to win business from hard-pressed consumers, others who depend on discretionary spending, or spending linked to the housing market – such as Home Depot or Macy’s department stores – seem less likely to benefit.The split in fortunes between basic and discretionary spending extends across the consumer sector.In the food industry, restaurants are showing signs of strain: same-store sales growth at McDonald’s has been slowing, while Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, has declared that the US consumer is already in a recession, as his company reported a second quarter of falling traffic.However, food companies such as Kellogg, Kraft and Pepsico are more troubled by higher commodity prices than slowing demand, and see themselves as able to profit if consumers opt to eat at home, rather than restaurants.Also, suppliers of household staples, such as Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark and Clorox, argue that they have seen no significant slowing in demand, or evidence of consumers shifting to cheaper alternatives.Ian Cook, chief executive of Colgate Palmolive, told investors that “so far we are seeing no indication of the slowdown,” in the US.But beyond personal care, companies that sell even some of the most basic household products have been feeling the pressure. Newell Rubbermaid, whose products range from storage bins to baby chairs, cut its 2008 sales growth forecast on January 31 to 2-3 per cent, down from its previous forecast of 3-5 per cent.Martin Franklin, chief executive of Jarden, argues that his company’s lower-cost consumer products such as coffee pots and fire extinguishers will benefit from the rebates. “I don’t think the stimulus package is going to make you go out and buy that $2,000 flat-screen TV.“But when it comes to going out and buying some of the smaller ticket items that you have in your life that you don’t want to cut back on, then I think the stimulus package will have a positive effect.”Predictably, US retailers welcomed the federal tax rebates, which they had lobbied strongly for. Tracy Mullin, chief executive of the NRF, described the package as “a crucial component to economic recovery”.But as retailers set out their first-quarter earnings view over the coming two weeks, investors still expect the overall mood to remain sober, with retailers taking a conservative approach to inventory planning, with resulting knock-on effects for their suppliers.
286;HD;Home Depot;2008-02-12T19:05:16Z;Activist investor joins Sprint board;;Ralph Whitworth, the activist investor, is joining the board of Sprint Nextel, a move that gives him a bigger platform to put pressure on management to improve the performance of the struggling US telecoms group.Mr Whitworth’s investment firm, Relational Investors, owns a stake of about 2 per cent in Sprint. The company’s new chief executive Dan Hesse has been keen to avoid a public confrontation with the investor.Mr Whitworth, who last year raised pressure on Home Depot to oust Bob Nardelli as chief executive, has been a vocal opponent of Sprint’s plans to spend billions of dollars to build a US high-speed wireless network using nascent WiMax technology.He has argued the company should focus on reviving its mobile phone business, which is the third-largest in the US but has been losing subscribers for months, and solving the problems caused by the takeover of Nextel Communications.”A turnaround at Sprint Nextel won’t be easy, but I believe the ingredients are in place to get the job done for the company’s shareholders,” Mr Whitworth said in a statement.Sprint shares have lost more than 60 per cent since the Nextel deal in 2005.Unlike other activists who prefer to put pressure on management from the outside, partly because they want to retain the ability to buy and sell shares freely, Mr Whitworth and his associates have often joined boards of target companies such as Home Depot and Sovereign Bank of Pennsylvania.Mr Whitworth will be in a minority on the 12-strong board, which includes executives from the media, telecoms and defence industries. But his presence, allied with his pugnacious style and financial expertise, is likely to give him some influence on Sprint’s future direction.The appointment comes at a crucial time for Sprint and Mr Hesse, who became chief executive in December.Mr Hesse replaced Gary Forsee, who resigned in October under pressure from the board, and immediately launched a strategic review of WiMax, an emerging “fourth generation” technology aimed at offering faster wireless connections.After scrapping talks over a $5bn WiMax joint venture with Clearwire, a smaller technology group, Sprint is believed to be looking at ways of offloading some of the costs of the project.Sprint’s options are believed to include spinning off the business in order to attract outside funding from companies that could include Intel, the retailer Best Buy and Google.Sprint recently announced larger-than-expected subscriber losses and said it would cut about 4,000 jobs. Wall Sreet is bracing for further bad news when it reports its yearly results on February 28.
287;HD;Home Depot;2008-02-11T18:54:25Z;Europe’s saplings need financial fertiliser;;"After recent financial turmoil, it would be tempting for European policymakers to rein in the scope of financial innovation – tempting, but misguided. On the contrary, the current focus on financial stability must go hand in hand with a renewed policy impetus to improve the European financial system’s ability to foster enterprise growth.A look at the world’s largest companies offers both comfort and concern. On the face of it, Europe holds its ground well. Its share of the FT Global 500’s market value has increased over the past five years and now reaches 32 per cent, while the US share has plummeted from 57 per cent to 38 per cent. But, in contrast with the US and most other economies, Europe’s champions are ageing giants. Only 12 out of the 154 European companies in the ranking were created after 1950. Among US companies, those born after 1950 number 51 out of 174. Europe has a prosperous stock of established large companies, but does a dismal job of grooming new ones.One reason is that Europe lacks the high-powered innovation ecosystems that generate the Microsofts, Genentechs and Googles of this world. But among US companies now worth more than $20bn and born in the past half-century, high-technology companies remain a minority. Apart from a few energy companies, most of the rest are service innovators: the likes of FedEx, Carnival Cruises, Las Vegas Sands, retailers such as Wal-Mart or Home Depot, media outfits and financial services companies. Technological innovation, while crucial, is not the only factor driving the continuous emergence of new giants in the US. Others are the size of its domestic market, especially for services, where Europe remains fragmented; the flexibility of its labour market; and the higher cultural and social status of entrepreneurs.But an additional factor is often overlooked: the American finance industry offers more support for the growth of emerging companies than its European counterpart. Economic research in the past 20 years has firmly established that financial development is not only a consequence, but also a cause, of economic growth. Efficient financial systems enable the allocation of capital to businesses and entrepreneurs with the highest growth potential.Europe’s recent financial development has been impressive but remains unbalanced. The continent’s large companies can now rely on deep, liquid and efficient capital markets. But every available indicator suggests that emerging enterprises benefit from a wider range of appropriate financing solutions in the US than in Europe.Private equity comes first to mind. Beyond it, many credit offerings, such as high-yield bonds, mezzanine loans and other subordinated debt instruments are well suited to high-growth service businesses that can pledge no tangible assets as collateral. The markets for these financial products remain comparatively underdeveloped in Europe, especially outside the UK and Nordic countries.Moreover, corporate finance for mid-sized businesses is a proximity business: it must reach the companies where they are and it requires the intensive use of local information. The concentration of a very efficient finance industry in a few places cannot be a substitute for widespread financial development.This important factor in economic growth remains a blind spot of policy. The European Union’s much-heralded Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs has 24 “integrated guidelines”, but none specifically touches the financial system. The reasons may be found in the political economy of Europe’s post-war economies, when capital scarcity was the norm and the financial sector was managed under tight state control.A new impetus is needed to make Europe’s financial system more supportive of emerging enterprises. The times for direct provision of financing by governments, through co-investment or public guarantees, are largely gone. Instead, policy initiatives should focus on creating a level playing field with the right incentives for market players. Much could be achieved with a mix of assertive competition policy, less prescriptive securities regulation in markets reserved for professional investors, a Europe-wide effort to simplify and harmonise insolvency procedures, the elimination of tax distortions between financial instruments and an evolution of prudential rules to encourage investment in emerging companies. Many levers are at national level, but a concerted effort by the EU’s member states would maximise the chances of success.In the current turmoil, policymakers must keep their eye on the ball. Europe’s priority remains higher long-term growth and that means entrepreneurial new companies. The financial crisis will inevitably result in a rash of initiatives and regulations: in their discussion, all should remember that what Europe needs is more private equity for growth and expansion, more venture capital, a liquid market for high-yield bonds and more sophisticated and competitive corporate finance offerings.Policy responses to the perils of instability should not put a heavy lid on those financial innovations that are necessary to improve Europe’s growth potential. From an economic and political point of view, Europe’s financial system must be improved so that more young sprouts can grow and challenge Europe’s tall old corporate trees.The writers, respectively assistant professor of finance at NYU Stern School of Business and research fellow at Bruegel, are the authors of Financing Europe’s Fast Movers (www.bruegel.org)"

The scenes they conjure up need to be picked with care. Copper cockerels continue to crow from the top of church spires and ferrous foxes still leap along farm roofs but today’s weather vanes come in great variety. There are hunts in full cry; flying pigs; golfers; Harrier jump jets; the Taj Mahal; jazz quintets; teapots; policemen; angels; Koi Carps; and endless gardening scenes including one showing a gardener in battle with a mole. All are made from wrought iron and can be found on www.weathervanes.co.uk at about £100 to £300 including value added tax and shipping in the UK – shipping to North America is a little more.I like their outré designs but prefer weather vanes in copper.

Can you blame them? The backdrop is scary and it could get a lot scarier. The economy has probably slipped into recession. The dollar could plunge to depths that are hard to imagine. The credit market crunch could morph overnight from a crisis into a catastrophe.Considering this scenario, what is the smartest course of action? Should investors take cover and hide? In a word, no. A rare opportunity to score huge gains in the stock market exists right now. Scores of high-quality companies have been discarded by panicky investors at fire-sale prices. The gap between price and value has widened to extraordinary levels.When the gap will close is anybody’s guess. That the gap will close is a certainty. If you are an observer of cycles, you know that difficult markets never last. In due course, the sun will shine and optimism will reign again on Wall Street. There is but one mandate facing the enterprising investor when negativity is abundant; that is, to get in front. If you wait for the backdrop to improve before getting positioned, it will be too late. Prices will have already adjusted upward, well in advance of the fundamentals.Here are some stock ideas to consider. There is a cloud of pessimism surrounding each company. Because of the hefty discounts applied to these names (which I own and continue to buy) investors should expect gains of 50-100 per cent over the next couple of years.● Circuit City. This stock is so cheap at the current quote (less than $5 a share) that buyers have a good chance of at least quadrupling their money. The stock was at $20 a year ago when a slew of self-inflicted operating problems led to a string of poor quarterly reports. Circuit City has a number of levers it can pull to unlock value, such as a growing high-margin consulting business (Fire Dog), a strong internet presence and plenty of liquidity.● Home Depot. Is there any investor alive who doesn’t already know that this retailer is sensitive to the housing cycle? When the entire investment community is fearful of the same thing, you can bet that fear is fully discounted. The market has overreacted, as it usually does, by pricing Home Depot stock at an extraordinarily cheap multiple of 50 per cent of sales. Home Depot investors do not need housing to rebound to robust levels in order to reap handsome profits. The stage is already set for a return of optimism. As easy quarterly comparisons cycle through, investors will soon realise that the worst news is behind this company, not ahead.● Tecumseh Products. If you like no-brainer stocks, you will like this idea. The dramatic changes necessary to fix Tecumseh are done. Sell both the engine and electrical businesses – done. Pay off all domestic debt – done. Sell other miscellaneous assets not necessary to the business, recover monies from an over-funded pension and request a large tax refund. Done, done, done. Get out your spreadsheet and adjust for the dramatic change at Tecumseh and what you have left is something quite impressive. You have a world leader in compressors that generates healthy normalised margins on more than $1.1bn in sales. The balance sheet will have zero debt and well over $100m in cash in the next few months after monies from the tax refund, pension conversion and other items are received. The market is not paying attention here because the company is valued at only $440m. Big mistake. Check back in a couple of years. It will be at least double that number.● Overstock. The current stock quote does not come close to pricing this company correctly. Critics of Overstock used to harp on about its balance sheet. Not any more. Cash is piling up fast. The company will end the year with $110m in cash after all bills are paid. That is a nice cash cushion for a growing online retailer that the market says is only worth $375m, or less than 40 per cent of sales. Look for a variety of growth initiatives in 2008 to re-ignite growth, such as the launch of Overstock Europe and Overstock Canada.● Citigroup. The future for this conglomeration of market-leading global businesses looks exceptionally bright. Nearly everybody is critical of Citigroup right now. To be sure, past mistakes merit criticism. But the issue for investors is not what the company has done over the past couple of years. The issue is what Citigroup will look like two years from now. Over that time frame, investors can expect to generate a 50-100 per cent return.The writer is a portfolio manager for Alsin Capital and the Turnaround Fund arne@alsincapital.com"
290;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Board-investor communication;;Here’s a shocker: Pfizer’s directors are talking directly to its biggest investors. The US drug company’s board invited institutional investors to a private meeting in October as part of efforts to calm a shareholder revolt that forced the early retirement of its chief executive in 2006. The move was highly unusual for the US, where confrontational attitudes have been the norm. One Wall Street legal eagle decried Pfizer’s plans as “corporate governance run amok” and said they would undermine competitiveness.International experience suggests just the opposite. Regular chats between boards and large investors can be beneficial. In the UK, a 2005 company law formalised the role of a senior independent director. At some companies the person in that position has begun meeting informally with big investors to smooth tensions and head off conflicts before they surface.Participants in the Pfizer meeting came away impressed. Billed as a “listening session” where the board would hear concerns about pay and governance, the gathering turned into a discussion. Both sides found they had more in common than expected – including a sense that quarterly earnings guidance is unimportant for pharmaceuticals, with their long research and development cycle.It is not clear, though, that this kind of meeting will become common. A few US companies experimented with shareholder advisory committees in the late 1980s but the practice never took hold. Recently, only UnitedHealth and Home Depot have tried anything like it, and both also had shareholder problems. But Yale’s Millstein Center for Corporate Governance is trying to help more companies reach out without violating the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules against selective disclosure of non-public information.The SEC has just voted against giving shareholders the power to use the company proxy to nominate board candidates, blocking one way of strengthening links between investors and boards. If independent directors are supposed to represent shareholders’ interests, shouldn’t they at least talk to them first?
291;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Online US retail sales exceed expectations;;US online retail sales have been growing at better-than-expected rates in the run-up to the holidays, according to Wall Street analysts and internet retailers.The news mirrors the robust start to the holiday shopping season reported by traditional retailers.Raul Vazquez, chief executive of Walmart.com, said the retailer had seen sales on the Friday after Thanksgiving holiday “exceed our expectations” of 40-60 per cent annual growth.Ron LaPierre, president of PriceGrabber, a comparison shopping site, said sales through its site had been running “at or above expectations” so far.Over the holiday weekend, sales had grown 45 per cent on last year, although the seasonal pick-up in demand had come later than last year.“I think that with the economy, consumers weren’t sure what they were going to do and they were putting it off. And now there isn’t time to put it off and everyone’s jumping in,” he said.Leading retailers launched a fresh barrage of special online offers linked to “Cyber Monday” – the Monday after the Thanksgiving weekend.It regularly sees the season’s first spike in online sales as American staff return to work and start shopping from office computers.Sales on the Monday last year hit $608m, according to ComScore Metrics, which tracks e-commerce sales and traffic.The busiest online shopping day usually falls about 10 days before Christmas – with last year’s daily peak of $666m coming on December 13. ComScore is forecasting that Cyber Monday sales will exceed $700m this year.Brian Pitz, analyst at Bank of America Securities, said in a note to clients that ComScore’s data so far “indicate more of an acceleration towards “Cyber Monday” than we have previously witnessed”.The “Cyber Monday” event – built around a marketing tag created two year’s ago by the National Retail Federation – continues to gain momentum with retailers.This year, more participated in special one-day online offers, including Macy’s, Sears, KB Toys and Home Depot, while retailers have also stepped up free delivery offers.Walmart.com, one of the largest US e-commerce sites, is again offering special online deals over all five days of what it is calling “Cyber Week”, and has extended the number of online offers from 50 to 150 items. Best Buy, the electronics retailer, ran a two-day online sale, starting on Sunday.Mr Vazquez said Walmart.com was expecting to see around 30m unique visitors during the coming week, slightly above the total number of visitors to the site during the entire month of October.ComScore is forecasting 20 per cent growth in online sales in November and December. Online sales account for less than 5 per cent of total US retail sales, which are forecast by the National Retail Federation to grow 4 per cent.
292;HD;Home Depot;2007-11-19T13:27:50Z;Lowe’s slides amid housing gloom;;Lowe’s, the second biggest home improvement retailer in the US, on Monday issued its second profit warning in two months and sounded a fresh gloomy note on the housing market, as it revealed a 10 per cent drop in earnings.“During the quarter it was difficult to sustain sales momentum across much of the country,” said Robert Niblock, chairman and chief executive. “Based on our results and the significant losses and writedowns announced this quarter in the banking and mortgage industry its clear that the pressures on our industry and the … consumer are greater than we previously anticipated and are likely to last longer than we expected.”Mr Niblock said the company was taking a “more conservative approach” on the next quarter because of the economic headwinds and worse than expected housing environment.Shares in Lowe’s dropped by as much as 7 per cent following its earnings release.Lowe’s is the latest retailer to issue a profit warning and report falling profits, as the impact of the deepening housing slump and higher energy prices appear to be hurting consumer spending.Home Depot, Lowe’s larger rival, delivered a 27 per cent drop in earnings and also cut its earnings forecast for the year last week.Lowe’s business, like Home Depot’s, is dependent on big scale do-it-yourself projects and renovations, but has been hit by falling consumer demand as falling home prices have deterred homeowners from spending. The company also blamed unusually warm weather and droughts in some areas of the country for weaker revenues.Lowe’s had until recently been more upbeat about the outlook for the housing market, saying at the time of its last quarterly results in August that it saw tentative signs of recovery in the northeast. But a profit warning on 24 September, saying that results this quarter would be at the low end or below forecasts, and again on Monday have signaled that the company has been overoptimistic.The company’s results deteriorated over the quarter, with September and October much weaker than August, compared to the previous year. An unusually warm quarter and droughts across the US also hit sales, the company said. Sales were lower than expected in more than three quarters of the regions that the company operates in.Lowe’s also cautioned about the impact on consumer spending of the resetting of adjustable rate mortgages to higher levels, and of soaring energy prices. Adjustable rate mortgages, which frequently offer a “teaser” lending rate only to be bumped up later on, have played a large part in rising defaults and foreclosures on homes in the US.Net earnings in the company’s third quarter fell 10.2 per cent to $643m, or 43 cents a share. Sales in stores open for at least a year, an important gauge of retail performance, fell by 4.3 per cent.Lowe’s now expects earnings for the full year ending in February to be $1.83 to $1.87 a share. In September, the company said it would deliver earnings at the low end or slightly below a range of $1.97 to $2.01.
293;HD;Home Depot;2007-11-15T22:05:56Z;Wall St falls on JC Penney warning;;Wall Street stocks fell on Thursday after JC Penney, the department store operator, warned of “dramatically” weaker sales and financials were sold amid continued concern about credit-related losses.Major equity indices once again succumbed to a late-session sell-off with volatility spiking higher as shares declined.“Consumer stocks have been weak all day,” said Jim Herrick, manager of equity trading at Robert W. Baird & Co. “Investors are nervous, there is a lot of headline risk.”Meanwhile technology, energy and materials stocks, until recently among the best performing sectors, continued to feel selling pressure.The S&P 500 closed 1.3 per cent lower at 1,451.16, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.9 per cent at 13,110.05 and the Nasdaq Composite was off 1 per cent at 2,618.51. The CBOE Vix index, Wall Street’s so-called fear barometer, jumped 9.3 per cent to 28.4.Financials continued to weigh on the broader market after the Barclays, the UK bank, became the latest bank to declare credit market losses. It announced a £1.3bn writedown on its exposure to credit-related securities, although this was less than many had feared.General Electric, 1.8 per cent weaker at $38.31, said a $5bn short-term bond fund run by an asset management subsidiary had run into trouble because of losses on asset-backed securities.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said investors remained jittery about credit market turmoil.“It’s almost universally accepted that we are going to have major fallout from this,” he said.Companies exposed to the mortgage sector suffered further sharp falls after the chief executive of Wells Fargo, the second-biggest US mortgage lender, warned that the housing slump was now the worst since the Great Depression. The company’s shares shed 3.9 per cent to $31.97.Washington Mutual slid 4.4 per cent to $20.43, Countrywide Financial fell 8.7 per cent to $12.21 and Fannie Mae, the mortgage agency, shed 10 per cent to $43.04. Among the big banks, Citigroup was down 4.1 per cent at $34.58 while Lehman Brothers declined 3.8 per cent to $62.97.JC Penney helped to depress equities after it raised fears of a consumer slowdown by posting a 9 per cent decline in quarterly profit.The department store operator warned that sales had declined “dramatically” in the past two months and cut current quarter and annual guidance due to expectations of a weaker retail environment.Its shares fell 5.1 per cent to $44.33, with the S&P retail index down 1.1 per cent at 420.21.JC Penney’s disappointing results came a day after Macy’s cut its sales forecast for the quarter. Investors are nervously watching for signals that the housing slump has led to a fall-off in consumer spending.Wal-Mart, however, 0.7 per cent weaker at $46.20, beat earnings expectations earlier this week. Home Depot also outperformed – only 0.2 per cent lower at $28.98, after a fund controlled by Edward Lampert, the billionaire investor, disclosed a stake.Fears of an economic slowdown drove a brisk trade in shares in the consumer staples sector. Costco, the discount retailer, rose 0.4 per cent to $66.34 while Supervalu, the grocery retailer, jumped 1.3 per cent to $39.81.In the technology sector Applied Materials’ latest quarterly profit declined as sales of its tools were hit by a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry.Citi Investment Research upgraded the stock to “buy”, saying fundamentals in the semiconductor equipment sector had “finally reached a trough”. The shares advanced 0.3 per cent at $18.87.Genzyme rose 2.9 per cent to $72.84 after it was revealed Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor, had acquired a stake.In economic news, consumer price inflation data showed a modest rise last month. Overall CPI rose 0.3 per cent in October, while core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy inputs, rose just 0.2 per cent, in line with estimates.Meanwhile, initial jobless claims rose 20,000 to 339,000 versus the 320,000 forecast by economists. The Philly Fed manufacturing index rose from 6.8 to 8.2 this month, indicating an expansion of activity. Economists had predicted a slowdown.
294;HD;Home Depot;2007-11-15T19:58:55Z;Credit contagion;;How contained is the housing meltdown? So far investors have singled out financials and consumer discretionary stocks for a beating. They are the only two S&P500 sectors down this year, by 14 per cent and 11 per cent respectively.The debacle in subprime mortgages has left investors terrified of what nasties might lie hidden on balance sheets. Consumer discretionary stocks have been caught in the same property downdraft. Part of that is direct exposure, through the beleaguered housebuilders and DIY giants Lowe’s and Home Depot. But investors seem to believe the rot will spread further. Retailers overall have tracked financials remarkably closely.The fear is that a vicious circle develops for consumers, whose confidence has taken a hit from the housing turmoil (compounded by high fuel and food prices). The danger is, they also find banks draw in their horns and tighten credit beyond the obvious area of mortgages.Already there are signs of rising US loan impairment charges on non-mortgage products such as credit cards and unsecured loans, as flagged recently by HSBC. That could push banks – wary of overstretching in the face of big mortgage, leveraged loan and commercial real estate exposures – to reduce availability of credit, thereby weakening economic growth. In turn, that might add upward pressure to delinquencies.The latest Federal Reserve loan officer survey showed lending standards and terms tightening for commercial and industrial loans as well as for some consumer loans.With more housing pain to come, investors have sold retailers and consumer cyclicals before there is clear proof of the knock-on effects.Other sectors, such as technology, buoyed by strong overseas growth, have remained relatively immune. But even for them the US market remains vital. There is a risk that the housing shockwaves have further to spread. Just witness Cisco’s comments last week, that banks’ problems were affecting IT demand. Trigger-happy investors hammered the technology sector by 8 per cent in just three days.
295;HD;Home Depot;2007-11-13T22:06:53Z;Wall St rallies as confidence returns;;US stocks enjoyed their best day in almost two months after Wal-Mart’s latest quarterly earnings helped restore a measure of confidence in the health of the US consumer.Financial stocks surged even as Bank of America became the latest group to disclose big writedowns.Investors were cheered after the chief executive of Goldman Sachs said the bank did not expect to make any significant writedowns.Meanwhile, technology stocks rebounded, with Apple leading the charge, bringing an end to a four-day losing streak for the sector.Stocks extended gains after the National Association of Realtors said pending home sales rose last month, the first increase since June.The S&P 500 index closed 2.9 per cent higher at 1,481.01 its biggest advance since mid-September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose back above 13,000, gaining 2.5 per cent to 13,307.09 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.5 per cent to 2,673.65.Wal-Mart saw a higher-than-expected 8 per cent rise in third-quarter profits and raised its full-year earnings forecast. Its shares climbed 6.1 per cent to $45.97, their biggest one-day gain in five years.Adrianne Shapira, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said the retailer was “an excellent place to hide in the current choppy macro environment”.Home Depot underscored lingering concerns about the US retail sector after its quarterly profit fell 26.8 per cent. The home improvement chain has been hurt by the deteriorating US housing market. The results matched Wall Street’s forecasts and the shares gained 2.3 per cent at $29.12.The S&P retail index rose 3.8 per cent at 435.64. Macy’s gained 6.6 per cent at $30.65, Nordstrom rose 4.5 per cent at $34.50 and Office Depot jumped 5.4 per cent at $19.84.The better tone in stocks triggered a 23 per cent slide in equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Option Exchange’s Vix index. The Vix closed above 31 on Monday, its highest level since March 2003, but fell to 24 on Tuesday.“Markets are likely to remain volatile during the coming week as risk aversion predominates,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “But the equity correction has already run a long way, and there could be signs of relief to come.”Financials enjoyed bumper gains after Goldman Sachs‘ chief executive said he does not expect the bank to take any significant asset write-downs. Speaking about the firm’s difficult-to-value level three assets Lloyd Blankfein said: “We’re confident we have a grip on the valuation of these things.” The shares soared 8.5 per cent to $233.04, their biggest one-day advance in six years.But Joe Price, Bank of America‘s chief financial officer, addressing the same conference, said his company expected to record $3bn in writedowns related to its exposure to collateralised debt obligations. But its shares still rose 5.2 per cent at $46.27 after the bank said it was sitting on a potential gain of more than $30bn on its investment in China Construction Bank.E-Trade Financial jumped 40.8 per cent at $5 after BMO Capital Markets said the online brokerage was “highly unlikely” to go bankrupt. The shares plunged 59 per cent the previous day after an analyst raised the possibility of a run on E-Trade’s bank.Other banks and brokerages surged. Lehman Brothers rose 9.2 per cent at $63.49 after an analyst at UBS said potential losses from CDOs were “negligible”. Citigroup rose 6.9 per cent at $35.90 while JPMorgan added 6.3 per cent to $45.05.The S&P investment bank index rose 6.8 per cent at 190.68 while the financial index rose 4.9 per cent at 426.93. Also on the rebound were technology stocks, a sector that has borne the brunt of recent selling pressure on concerns about a slowdown in corporate tech spending.Apple rallied 10.5 per cent at $169.96 on reports it was in talks about launching its iPhone in China. Oracle gained 5.6 per cent at $20.52 while Research In Motion rose 9.7 per cent at $112.55.But Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research said there remained an “underlying inconsistency between being pessimistic on US consumer trends and optimistic on technology spending activity”.
296;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Forecast down as Home Depot sales fall;;Home Depot, the largest US home improvement retailer, on Tuesday reported a sharp decline in its quarterly earnings and profits, as it said that the continuing slump in the housing market had turned out worse than it expected.Frank Blake, the chief executive, said that the market and industry “continues to face into significant headwinds”.“We started the year with a more pessimistic view of the housing and home improvement markets than many,” he said.“It turns out we were not pessimistic enough,” he added.The retailer said its third- quarter earnings were down 27 per cent on the same period last year at $1.09bn, or 60 cents per share, while sales fell 3.5 per cent to $18.96bn.Sales at stores open at least a year were down 6.2 per cent.Mr Blake said that Home Depot was continuing to invest in its store network, with plans to spend $3.9bn on new and current stores this year.However, he said the company was maintaining a “cautious” stance on the next stage of its planned $22.5bn recapitalisation.“We would say – looking at our business and looking at the credit markets – that this is a time to pause and to make sure we have a pretty firm idea going forward, before making that second and third step in the recapitalisation plan.”“We remained committed …it is just a matter of figuring out the right timing,” he added.Home Depot has already bought back an initial tranche of $10.7bn shares in September, using funds from the sale of its HD Supply wholesale unit, cash and bonds.Mr Blake announced the share buy-back programme after he took over from Robert Nardelli as chief executive in January, in a move which was seen as underlining the retailer’s intention to be more responsive to the concerns of its shareholders.Carol Tome, chief financial officer, said the retailer was continuing to see “real weakness” in demand in Florida, California and the north-east US.“It doesn’t matter what metric you want to look at, it’s bad.”The retailer also lowered its forecast for the full year.It said that earnings per share could dip by as much as 11 per cent for the fiscal year, compared with the decline of between 7 per cent and 9 per cent that it had forecast in September.Home Depot shares ended Tuesday’s session 2.3 per cent higher at $29.12 in New York.
297;HD;Home Depot;2007-11-05T21:42:05Z;Wall St down on Citi losses;;Wall Street shares were weaker on Monday after news that Citigroup faces up to $11bn in additional mortgage-related write-downs leached more confidence from the troubled financial sector.During a choppy session the S&P 500 fell as much as 1.3 per cent but stocks later recovered, briefly turning positive as short sellers covered their positions. Better-than-expected service sector data also helped to dispel some of the gloom.The S&P 500 closed 0.5 per cent lower at 1,502.17. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 13,543.40, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5 per cent at 2,795.18.Small-caps again felt the worst of the selling pressure. The Russell 2000 index fell 0.9 per cent at 790.43.Utilities and consumer staples outperformed, while financials, materials and consumer discretionary stocks were weakest.Retailers were also under pressure after an analyst at Deutsche Bank downgraded two big home improvement chains. Home Depot fell 2 per cent to $29.80 and Lowe’s shed 3.4 per cent to $25.13. The S&P retail index shed 2 per cent to 434.47.Citigroup set the tone for the session after Chuck Prince quit as chief executive and chairman. The bank said it faced additional write-downs of between $8bn and $11bn. The losses come on top of $6.5bn in asset writedowns and other credit-related losses suffered during the third quarter.The shares fell 4.9 per cent at $35.90 after a slide of 11.5 per cent last week and now lie at their lowest level in more than four years.Fitch Ratings downgraded Citigroup and said its rating outlook was negative. Moody’s Investors Service also cut its ratings while Standard & Poor’s said it may do. “The magnitude of writedowns calls into question risk management,” S&P said.T.J. Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said: “These developments will certainly ripple further and deeper along in the banking system, creating added downside economic risk.”Financial stocks recorded some of the sharpest declines on Monday.The S&P investment bank index fell 4 per cent to 184.32 and is down 12.9 per cent since October 31. The S&P financial index shed 1.4 per cent to 418.27, its lowest level since November 2005.Other banking stocks suffered losses amid increasing chatter about their exposure to so-called “level 3 assets” – holdings that are so illiquid they are difficult to value.Goldman Sachs declined 4.9 per cent to $218.39, while Morgan Stanley fell 5.6 per cent to $55.59. Merrill Lynch was off 2.4 per cent at $55.88.Credit insurers were mixed. Radian fell 6.4 per cent to $9.20, while MBIA fell 6.4 per cent to $33.23. But Ambac Financial, the municipal bond insurer, rallied 4.6 per cent to $24.60. Its shares have tumbled 65 per cent in the past month“The moral of the story is that subprime and CDOs [collateralised debt obligations] aren’t over, even if the equity community is tired of hearing about them,” said Douglas Peta, market strategist at J&W Seligman. “We ought to be paying attention.”Options analysts reported an increase in traders buying downside protection as equity volatility remained stretched.The overall Chicago Board Options Exchange put/call ratio – a measure of the balance between traders buying protection against a fall in the market versus those hedging against a rise – rose to 1.15 at the end of last week, indicating nervousness about a potential fall in the market. However, the ratio remained below a high of 1.53 reached in August.Volatility as measured by the CBOE Vix index jumped 5.7 per cent to 24.32. Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research, said: “The underlying drivers of volatility may keep investors in a state of dizziness with markets trending higher.”Wellcare Health Plans jumped 21.7 per cent to $33.30 after net income increased 67 per cent in the third quarter. The shares fell more than 80 per cent last month after fraud investigators raided its offices.Google, up 2 per cent at $725.65, hit a new all-time high after it said it was developing a free mobile phone software package.In economic news, the Institute for Supply Management’s service sector index rose to 55.8 last month from 54.8 in September, beating expectations.
298;HD;Home Depot;2007-10-30T18:51:54Z;Private equity widens search;;Private equity groups are looking to boost deal activity by making greater use of alternative sources of debt financing including going to the sellers of the assets being bought, hedge funds, mutual funds and possibly sovereign wealth funds.Buy-out groups such as Blackstone, Carlyle, KKR and TPG have raised multibillion-dollar funds from investors in recent years and need to put their money to work. But to leverage their capital, they still need to secure debt financing from other sources.The problem for private equity is that the world’s largest banks remain reluctant to make new funding commitments. In recent weeks, the buy-out groups have been responding by reaching out more aggressively to new classes of deal financiers, people familiar with such deals say.In one example, private equity groups have continued to participate in the auction for Ford Motor’s Land Rover and Jaguar units because the US carmaker itself may be induced to finance the deal. The Land Rover and Jaguar sale is expected to involve a complicated trade-off between price – which could come in anywhere between $1bn and $2bn – and terms.There are precedents for these kind of deals. As far back as 2002, a group including Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs and TPG bought Burger King from Diageo, the drinks conglomerate, using a loan from Diageo at a below-market 1.7 per cent interest rate.More recently, a similar type of vendor financing worth $1.5bn from Germany’s Daimler helped Cerberus seal its purchase of Chrysler as the credit squeeze hit Wall Street in late July.The private equity firms buying Home Depot Supply from its parent in August were also able to extract guarantees on $1bn of debt from Home Depot itself as part of a renegotiation of that deal. Last week, Hellman & Friedman highlighted the new approach to dealmaking when it agreed to buy Goodman Global, a manufacturing company, for $2.65bn.Financing came from an arm of General Electric, hedge funds Farallon Capital and GSO Capital Partners and banks such as Calyon of France that traditionally have not been big players in financing buy-outs. The financing for a rival bid included the backing of another hedge fund, Silver Point Capital.Investment banks say they are not unduly worried. “The issuers will find it complicated to find the least common denominator to bring syndicates together,” says Tom Newberry, global head of syndicated loans at Credit Suisse Group, referring to the private equity firms.“It isn’t always so comfortable to leave their fate to a syndicate of diverse investors – any one of which might pull out at the last minute.”
299;HD;Home Depot;2007-10-29T20:47:33Z;US retail gloom;;Most US retailers have seen sales growth slip only modestly. Their share prices tell a very different story. Employment and wages continue to grow, and consumers appear only slightly more reluctant to open their wallets. But fear is playing a strong role in deciding retailers’ valuations. The sector’s shares now trade at a 5 per cent price earnings discount to the S&P 500 on expectations that macroeconomic worries and higher fuel, housing and credit costs will inevitably take their toll on spending.The picture at the retailers is mixed. Sales of consumer staples are holding up reasonably well at the likes of Costco, Wal-Mart and BJ’s Wholesale. But September sales were disappointing at department stores, which made big markdowns on discretionary items to reduce swollen inventories. JCPenney and Nordstrom both cut their third-quarter profit expectations after missing September sales goals, as did Target. A bout of warm weather made matters worse by propelling customers into parks rather than malls.Home improvement leaders Home Depot and Lowe’s have taken a particularly harsh beating as the housing market continues to suffer and consumers shy away from using home equity to finance big-ticket purchases and new projects. Fallout from the housing slowdown should continue to hit sales of discretionary goods more broadly for months to come. Shares of electronics retailer Circuit City, for example, have dropped 73 per cent in the past 12 months, Office Depot is down 59 per cent and JCPenney is down 26 per cent, all hit by weak demand.All is not lost, though. Federal funds futures are pricing in a strong likelihood that interest rates will be cut further this week. Retailers have historically outperformed the market during periods of monetary easing. And, after several unnaturally warm weeks, there is now a nip in the air on the East Coast.
300;HD;Home Depot;2007-10-11T02:31:04Z;Chrysler’s shift in strategy accelerates;;Several non-US carmakers have approached Chrysler to possibly co-operate in the development of new vehicles, a senior Chrysler executive said on Wednesday night.Steven Landry, head of the Detroit carmaker’s North American sales, said these approaches, which remain at an early stage, have come since Cerberus Capital Management, the New York private-equity group, bought control of Chrysler in August from Germany’s Daimler.The proposals seek to marry the unnamed foreign carmakers’ expertise in vehicle platforms with Chrysler’s success in “top hats”, or the more visible parts of a vehicle.Chrysler’s senior management, including Bob Nardelli, the former chief executive of Home Depot who moved to Detroit in August, are in Las Vegas this week to rally 3,000 Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep dealers as part of Cerberus’s drive to reinvigorate the struggling carmaker.Jim Press, vice-chairman and president, said Chrysler needed to become more focused on its customers by, among other things, adjusting its product lineup and improving relations with dealers.Mr Press, who was hired from Toyota last month, said “we’ve got to look at the products through the eyes of the customers. It used to be that you had trade-offs. For the future, you’ve got to have customers satisfied.”For instance, he indicated that Chrysler is likely to pull back from its recent strategy of attempting to give the Jeep brand a softer, more urban image.Several Jeep models that have taken this approach have sold poorly.Recent moves to cull dealers and combine Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge brands under a single roof are likely to accelerate.Several Chrysler executives, past and present, said Cerberus’s arrival had markedly sped up decision-making at the carmaker. Mr Press cited a decision to reduce fourth-quarter production by 82,000 units which was taken on the basis of a seven-minute conference call.He said Chrysler’s distribution system was over-loaded with products that customers didn’t want, while it couldn’t turn out enough of the models that are in demand.He predicted that macro-economic trends increasingly favoured US carmakers over their foreign rivals. He cited the weakening US dollar, escalating costs outside the US and ground-breaking labour contracts between the Detroit-based carmakers and the United Auto Workers union.Chrysler and the UAW on Wednesday night reached a tentative deal on a new four-year labour contract, that includes transferring its retiree healthcare liabilities to an independent trust. Full details of the agreement have yet to be disclosed.
301;HD;Home Depot;2007-10-10T22:07:44Z;Gettelfinger’s poker face;;Ron Gettelfinger, head of the United Auto Workers union, may not have had many cards to play in labour contract negotiations with the three Detroit-based carmakers, but he showed a fine sense of when to play them.Two weeks ago Gettelfinger kept General Motors, its suppliers and its dealers on edge as he extended GM’s expired contract on an “hour-by-hour” basis. After raising the temperature for a weekend, he dramatically called 74,000 UAW members at GM out on strike. Yesterday, workers at Chrysler walked off their jobs (six hours before returning to them) after the UAW’s strike deadline came and went without a deal.Coincidentally – or perhaps not – Gettelfinger called his brief strike on the very day that the struggling carmaker’s new top brass, including ex-Home Depot chief executive Bob Nardelli and Jim Press, Toyota’s former North American head, were rallying about 3,000 dealers at Chrysler’s annual Dealer Announcement Show in Las Vegas.One of the main purposes of the event is to give dealers a sneak preview of new Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge models. Given the strike, some may have wondered whether they would have any cars to sell when they returned to their showrooms.But there was no shortage of applause filtering out of the meeting rooms at the Venetian resort yesterday afternoon. The dealers were presumably confident that, once again, Gettelfinger’s bark would prove worse than his bite.Canada boundOne of the unheralded triumphs of US policy in recent years has been its success in persuading people from other countries that they are unwelcome within the country’s borders.Foreign university students, software engineers, business people wishing to attend conferences, academics – all can attest to the difficulty of entering the US. It is a subject that has made American business leaders concerned about the country’s ability to compete effectively in the era of globalisation.Those worries are not likely to go away any time soon. This week, the White House released its national strategy for homeland security, a document that was long on words but short on details.One element the 53-page document spelled out, however, was the need for foreigners to provide more fingerprints in the future.Visitors to the US are used to long queues at airports as foreigner after foreigner is forced to provide a set of two fingerprints – both index fingers – as part of the US Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (Visit) programme.Those lines are set to become longer. “In the face of resourceful terrorists …we must continue to expand the US-VISIT programme’s biometric enrolment from two fingerprints to 10 fingerprints,” the strategy paper urged.The document called for more advanced “multi-modal biometric recognition capabilities” using data from fingerprints, the face and the iris.The new 10-fingerprint policy would seem likely to have a deterrent effect on terrorists.While would-be evil-doers may have been relaxed about having two fingerprints on file with the US government, they certainly will be forced to rethink their plans when asked to turn over eight additional prints.MultitaskerLavishing praise on his on-air talent would appear to be part of Jonathan Klein’s job description. But Klein, head of CNN’s US operations, seems genuinely in awe of Sanjay Gupta, the network’s medical correspondent.Granted, most of us have a certain respect for neurosurgeons, who are often grouped with rocket scientists as the benchmarks for braininess. But Klein seemed just as impressed by Gupta’s ability to juggle his schedule.Klein – who was introducing a screening of CNN’s forthcoming documentary, Planet in Peril, which Gupta hosts with Anderson Cooper and Jeff Corwin – noted that Gupta still performs brain surgery every Monday at Emory University in Atlanta.Juggling that while also flying off to China to report on the cancer risks in drinking water is a testament to Gupta’s impressive time-management skills, Klein noted.“Sanjay has pioneered removing the brain from the patient so he can work on it on the airplane,” Klein said. “It’s those new quart-sized plastic bags that make all the difference.”Brushing upSince leaving the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan has abandoned the cryptic turn of phrase he used to adopt for his oracle-like pronouncements.For example, Greenspan’s blunt criticism of his fellow Republicans has been making headlines in the weeks since his book, The Age of Turbulence, hit the stands.But the new, straight-talking Greenspan still has the ability to puzzle an audience about his real beliefs.Talking to 5,000 businesspeople in New York yesterday, he started off with a nod to none other than Karl Marx, noting that his egalitarian views could, in theory at least, be a solution to today’s income inequality in the US. No one expected the words of Marx to spill from the mouth of the Ayn Rand-loving Greenspan.But then he quickly paid tribute to the lasting appeal of Adam Smith’s free-market thinking.Noting that he had recently re-read The Wealth of Nations after nearly half a century, he professed to be “amazed at how much Adam Smith had learnt in 50 years”.Send your comments to observer@ft.com
302;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
303;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;UAW gives Chrysler strike deadline;;The United Auto Workers’ union has given privately owned Chrysler a Wednesday deadline to wrap up talks on a new labour contract or face a strike.America’s third-largest domestic carmaker, majority owned by buy-out group Cerberus Capital Management, will see workers at its US plants down tools on Wednesday morning if the two sides fail to reach agreement on the four-year contract and an expected separate deal on Chrysler’s retiree healthcare obligations.The UAW is understood to have given the deadline on Sunday, though it was not publicly confirmed by the carmaker until Monday. Chrysler could be the second US carmaker to face strike action in less than a month, as the big three Detroit’s carmakers seek to squeeze historic concessions on healthcare, wages and work rules out of the union.The UAW declared a strike at General Motors last month which ended less than two days later after the two sides reached agreement on a new contract and a deal on retiree healthcare liabilities. GM’s employees are still in the process of ratifying the agreement.Chrysler is understood to be seeking somewhat different terms than GM as it never benefited from a first round of concessions on healthcare, which the UAW agreed with GM and Ford Motor in 2005. At the time, the union was reluctant to give the same deal to Chrysler, which was then still part of the profitable German-owned DaimlerChrysler.Ron Gettelfinger, the UAW’s president, supported Cerberus’ recent purchase of Chrysler from the now-renamed Daimler, which kept just less than 20 per cent of the carmaker in a $7.4bn deal.However Chrysler’s new managers, led by Bob Nardelli, former Home Depot chief executive, are also anxious about conceding too much to the union after promising to write a new chapter for Detroit’s chronically cost-challenged car industry under private ownership.Chrysler’s managers have made clear that they are prepared to shift production out of the US if they fail to close the gap between their employee costs and those of their Asian competitors.Nor was it clear on Monday how badly a strike would hurt Chrysler. The company, which has struggled with excess inventory in the past, is idling production at five carmaking plants and an engine plant this week to reflect slower market demand.The UAW began contract talks with the three US carmakers in July, then focused on GM in an effort to extract similar concessions from Chrysler and Ford later. Its talks with Chrysler intensified at the end of last week.The union is due to start detailed negotiations with Ford, the most financially troubled of the Detroit manufacturers, last.
304;HD;Home Depot;2007-10-07T19:18:18Z;Flowers on rocky ground;;So much for reputational risk. The argument on Wall Street has long run something like this: private equity buyers will have to follow through on the deals they signed during the heady days of the credit bubble. If they do not, sellers will not trust them again, impairing their ability to buy and sell companies once the smoke clears.Chris Flowers is testing that theory in real time. On one side of the Atlantic, his buy-out firm, JC Flowers, is busy trying to claim a material adverse change (Mac) on his $25bn acquisition of student lender Sallie Mae – and either pull out of the deal or get the price reduced significantly. On the other, he is pursuing distressed UK mortgage lender Northern Rock.The distance may help. UK government officials, bankers and Northern Rock executives, are not, presumably, focusing too much attention on a US student lender. It is also true that Mr Flowers believes he has good grounds to claim the Mac – both because of legislative changes and the credit market turmoil – so he is not simply walking away for no reason. But the fact that Sallie Mae is currently taking a “see-you-in-court” approach suggests the case is not exactly cut and dried.The reality could well be that established buy-out groups do not face serious fallout from playing hardball. Let’s face it, as Diageo found out with its sale of Burger King and Home Depot with its supply division, there is little new in private equity groups renegotiating deals aggressively when they get the chance.The lesson for Northern Rock is that, if it finds a buyer, the contract must be as watertight as possible, especially given continuing uncertainty in the credit markets. As for the UK government, it is presumably focused on its own reputation and on maintaining confidence in the banking system. At least, should JC Flowers subsequently quit at a tidy profit in five years, there has been no taxpayers’ money involved. With buyers hardly queuing round the block, there is not the space to be too choosy.

The index also hit a new intraday record of 1,561.91 and has gained 2 per cent this week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also set a new intraday high of 14,124.54 but settled just shy of a record close, at 14,066.01, 1.3 per cent higher on the week.The Nasdaq Composite closed 2.9 per cent higher on the week at 2,780.32.Some of the strongest gains were recorded on the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks, up 4.9 per cent this week at 844.85.Much-anticipated jobs data provided a lift to the markets, even as they reduced pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.“This is definitely going to slow up any future rate cuts in the near term,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research. The economy added 110,000 jobs in September, slightly weaker than the 115,000 increase forecast by economists. A loss of 4,000 jobs in August was revised to a gain of 89,000.“The headline was as expected but the surprise was the upward revisions,” said David Ader, a bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.The futures market on Friday calculated an implied probability of 48 per cent that the Fed would cut interest rates by 25 basis points at the end of this month compared with an 84 per cent likelihood a week ago.Unemployment rose 0.1 per cent in September to 4.7 per cent. Average hourly earnings increased 0.4 per cent, up 4.1 per cent on the year.“The rise in earnings should also support the consumer and prevent a complete retrenchment that the housing situation threatens,” said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Positive jobs news lifted transport stocks, a traditional bellwether of the economy. The Dow transport index gained 3.3 per cent to 4,997.17 for the week.Consumer staples were flat while consumer discretionary and retailers stocks surged. Circuit City was 15.4 per cent higher at $9.13 on the week. Home Depot, up 5.5 per cent at $34.22, and Wal-Mart, 3.9 per cent higher at $45.37, were among the Dow’s best performers.Equity volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Option Exchange’s Vix index, slid 6.4 per cent on the week to 16.84.It was a big week for the banking sector. Merrill Lynch and Citigroup warned about third-quarter earnings. Bear Stearns told investors most of its businesses were on the “rebound”.Merrill said it expected a net loss in the third quarter of up to 50 cents a share after taking $4.5bn in writedowns linked to collaterised debt obligations and subprime mortgages. With the bad news in the open, the shares were 7.6 per cent higher on the week at $76.67.Citigroup, up 3.5 per cent at $48.30, warned that third-quarter earnings would probably fall 60 per cent. It faces writing down $3bn in subprime, leveraged loan and fixed income credit exposure. Bear Stearns gained 7.1 per cent to $131.58.Technology stocks continued their rally. Research in Motion soared 15 per cent to a high of $113.37 after it reported fiscal second-quarter profit that met expectations and raised guidance for the third quarter.Google, up 4.7 per cent at $594.05, set a record high after Bear Stearns raised its 2008 price target to $700.Alcoa on Friday gained 3 per cent to $38.79, 0.8 per cent lower this week, after it announced the restructuring of its electrical and electronic solutions business.General Electric climbed 0.9 per cent to $41.77 after it said lighting plants in Brazil and the US would close with the loss of up to 1,400 jobs.Homebuilder stocks were the surprise of the week. The S&P homebuilder index put on 12.3 per cent to 459.86 points after an analyst at Citi Investment Research said it was time to buy into the sector.Among the best performers on the S&P were Pulte Homes, up 13.4 per cent at $15.43; DR Horton, 14.4 per cent higher at $14.65; and KB Home, up 17.3 per cent at $29.40.The automotive sector was again in focus after the big car manufacturers reported September sales figures. General Motors gained 4.1 per cent to $38.20 after it reported increased US sales of 4 per cent last month.Energy stocks had a disappointing week as crude oil futures were sluggish. The S&P energy index was 0.2 per cent lower on the week at 578.05."
306;HD;Home Depot;2007-10-03T20:42:27Z;Wall St down despite encouraging jobs data;;Wall Street was weaker on Wednesday, with semiconductor and transport stocks sold down, as some encouraging employment data failed to convince investors about the health of the US economy.The S&P 500 closed 0.5 per cent lower at 1,539.14. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent at 2,727.72 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.6 per cent at 13,9666.35.In economic news, ADP, the payroll services firm, estimated that private sector jobs had risen 58,000 in September. The figure was in line with market expectations.But the Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing services index slipped to 54.8 in September from 55.8 in August. Economists had expected a reading of 55 – a level above 50 indicates an expansion in activity.The relatively benign economic data provided a catalyst for retail-related stocks early on but this rally tailed off later in the session.Consumer discretionary stocks remained the best of the leading 10 sectors on the S&P on Wednesday.Home Depot, up 1.5 per cent at $33.87, posted some of the best gains on the Dow.Materials, energy and technology stocks were weaker.Investor focus remains on the September payroll report, due tomorrow, which includes new private sector and government jobs. Economists expect growth of about 115,000. That would represent a rebound from the 4,000 decline in August.“As you look at ADP, bear in mind this is private payroll growth and so not exactly strong and not the sort of figure that keeps the Fed from easing again,” said David Ader, bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.The status of the labour market is seen as crucial to determining future Federal Reserve policy action.Analysts at UBS said: “We look to this Friday’s change in non-farm payrolls for direction on whether the Fed will continue to ease further.”The futures market was on Wednesday factoring in a 72 per cent implied probability of a 25 basis points cut at the end of this month. This is two percentage points lower than the previous day and compares with a reading of 86 per cent a week ago.The probability that the Federal Fund rate will remain unchanged has increased to 28 per cent from 14 per cent a week ago.Financial stocks were in focus again after a third-quarter earnings update from Deutsche Bank.Deutsche said it would incur a charge of up to $3.09bn for the third quarter owing to exposure on leveraged loans, structured credit and mortgage securities.Financials and investment banks have outperformed the market this week as investors believe the worst is behind banks dealing with problems in the mortgage and credit markets.The S&P investment bank index pared early gains to close flat at 212.70. Bear Stearnswas down 0.7 per cent at $127.74 after it announced 310 job losses at its mortgage businesses.CSX was 2.6 per cent lower at $41.93 after Morgan Stanley lowered its rating on the rail freight transportation concern.The stock weighed on the Dow transportation index, which closed 1.7 per cent lower at 4,840.77.Transportation has underperformed since the credit squeeze hit in mid-August, recovering just 3.7 per cent compared with 9.1 per cent for the Dow.In corporate news, Procter & Gamble, 0.5 per cent lower at $70.41, was in focus after reports it was considering selling brands including Duracell and its remaining food assets, Pringles and Folgers.Homebuilder stocks were higher for a third consecutive day after an analyst at Citi Investment Research said recent big share price falls meant it could be time to buy into the sector.The S&P homebuilder index was 2.3 per cent higher at 463.39. Pulte Homes gained 3 per cent to $15.96 and is 16 per cent higher this week.But Radian Group, the mortgage insurer, fell 9.5 per cent to $23.53 after Deloitte & Touche quit as its auditor.The S&P energy index fell 1 per cent to 574.23 as crude oil futures weakened during the session. Exxon Mobilshed 1 per cent to $91.33.General Motors led gains on the Dow, up 1.2 per cent at $37.49, after it reported a 4 per cent rise September US sales. Ford was 1.6 per cent lower at $8.43.
307;HD;Home Depot;2007-10-02T22:28:33Z;Multinationals spur US rally on weak dollar;;Multinationals have emerged as the main drivers of the current US stock market rally as investors move to capitalise on the weak dollar by buying into companies with large overseas earnings.The strong performance of international companies such as Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Intel over the past six weeks has pushed US stocks to new highs, helping the market shrug off the ongoing credit squeeze and the growing risk of a US recession.“2007 will go down as the year the rest of the world saved America,” said Joseph Quinlan, chief investment strategist at Bank of America. “The belief that the dollar is going to weaken further is prompting investors to own international large-cap stocks.”The strong showing by multinationals comes as US and foreign fund managers switch away from small capitalisation and US-centred companies they had favoured in the recent past.The stock market strength contrasts with previous rallies following interest rate cuts, which tended to benefit domestically-focused companies such as regional banks and retailers.This time, after the US Federal Reserve cut rates by 50 basis points on September 18, multinationals rallied while retailers such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot remained dogged by concerns over the health of US consumer spending.The weakness in the dollar, which has hit a series of all-time lows against major currencies, benefits multinational companies in two ways: it makes their US-made products cheaper on international markets and increases the dollar value of their overseas earnings.The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen nearly 10 per cent in the past six weeks, hitting a new record high on Monday.Companies with large overseas operations have been at the forefront of the rally. Since the Dow’s previous record – on July 19 – eight of the top ten performers have been multinational companies, led by P&G but also including Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson and McDonald’s.The Dow was closed down slightly in New York on Tuesday after sharply weaker-than-expected pending home sales data deepened fears of a recession. The dollar also edged off recent lows.However, many analysts remain bullish on the earnings outlook after the third quarter of the year.Growth in S&P 500 company earnings is forecast to slow to about 3.9 per cent in the third quarter, dragged by weaker-than-expected performance in the financial and consumer sectors.Earnings at financial companies are now seen rising 4 per cent rather than the 9 per cent forecast at the beginning of July, according to Thomson Financial.Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retailers and homebuilders, are expected to suffer a 4 per cent earnings slide. In July, analysts were forecasting a 3 per cent rise in the sector. Healthcare, with expected growth of 12 per cent, and technology, with 10 per cent, have the highest growth rates predicted for the third quarter.Earnings growth is expected to rebound across the board, reaching 11.5 per cent in the final quarter of the year, and remain strong into 2008, when earnings are seen rising 12 per cent.
308;HD;Home Depot;2007-10-01T17:56:13Z;The Short View: The Dow rally;;Happy days are here again, at least for the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the world’s most venerable stock index, on Monday morning went above its previous all-time record close, set on July 19.Since then, money and credit markets have been turned inside out and the dollar has collapsed. Citigroup, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow, on Monday revealed the extent of the damage to its bottom line: earnings for the third quarter will be 60 per cent below the level last year, owing to a $1.3bn loss in the credit markets.But the stock market took the Citi announcement as drawing a line under the credit squeeze. It had been braced for worse.Why such a strong rally? Many believe we are replaying the last “emergency” Fed rate cut from October 1998, in the wake of the Long-Term Capital Management debacle. That cut super-charged markets that had no need of easier money. In the first 30 trading days after that cut, the Nasdaq Composite gained 23.2 per cent. It went on to form the tech bubble.Now, in the 30 trading days since the credit squeeze forced the Fed to cut the rate at which it lends to banks, the MSCI emerging markets index has done even better, gaining 25.8 per cent. As in 1998, the theory is that the cut will help pour money into a sector that was already showing signs of delivering secular growth.The Dow’s resurgence shows more confidence in the rest of the world than in the US. Since it peaked on July 19, the best Dow stock is Procter & Gamble – a consumer group with steady demand for its products which gains from a weak dollar because it sells all over the world. It is up 12.75 per cent.The worst performer, down 16.3 per cent, is Home Depot, which is primarily a play on the US. A consumer-led recession would clobber its profits. This Dow peak reflects bullishness on emerging markets, but not on the dollar or the US economy.
309;HD;Home Depot;2007-09-27T02:39:48Z;JC Flowers team drops Sallie Mae bid;;The investor group that offered $26bn for Sallie Mae, the student lender, said on Wednesday it would not go ahead with the original terms of the deal, heralding what could be the biggest battle over a private equity bid agreed before the credit market freeze.Sallie Mae said it would take legal action against the group, led by JC Flowers, a buy-out firm run by Christopher Flowers, a former Goldman Sachs banker. Sallie Mae claims the consortium has “no contractual basis to repudiate its obligations under the merger agreement”.The bid, which would be the largest private equity takeover of a financial services company, has looked increasingly risky after the investor group warned that pending legislation would cut subsidies for university loans.In July, the group, which includes JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, said the legislation could result in a “failure of the conditions of the merger to be satisfied”.Sallie Mae said the law, which President George W. Bush is expected to sign on Thursday, would cut its “core earnings” by between 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent a year over the next five years.The consortium is expected to argue that this triggers an element of the “material adverse change” clause in the contract, which stated that the buyers could quit if new legislation on student lending subsidies had a negative impact on the business.The buyers also claim that Sallie Mae has been affected more severely by the changes in the credit markets than other financial companies, allowing them to invoke a second “MAC”. In a statement, the consortium suggested it would consider a deal at a lower price.The buy-out of Sallie Mae is one of a series of large private equity deals signed before the credit markets froze that are in danger of falling apart.Last week, KKR and the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs pulled the plug on an $8bn deal to acquire Harman International, the electronics company.The turmoil has made financing large leveraged buy-outs much more expensive, and, combined with a shaky economic outlook, the expected returns on these transactions are falling.In August, the sale of Home Depot’s wholesale supply business to a private equity consortium was renegotiated at a lower price.However, some large deals are being completed. This week, KKR completed its $26bn purchase of First Data Corporation, the credit card processing group. The banks funding the First Data takeover were able to sell the bulk of deal’s loan package at a discount.
310;HD;Home Depot;2007-09-25T20:43:18Z;Wall St rebounds from early lows;;Wall Street experienced a choppy session after big retailers lowered their sales forecasts and as house prices fell at their sharpest pace for 16 years.The market rebounded from early lows after existing home sales data declined at a slightly lower rate than anticipated. But athough technology stocks continued to surge, the gains failed to lift the broader market.The S&P 500 was flat at 1,517.22 after falling as low as 1,507.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed slightly higher, up 0.1 per cent at 13,778.65.The Nasdaq again outperformed the other main indices, as investors continued to favour tech-related stocks. The Nasdaq Composite index closed 0.6 per cent higher at 2,683.45, as Apple and Expedia hit all-time highs.Sentiment was bruised in early trade after disappointing sales forecasts from two big retailers and as new data showed consumer confidence had fallen close to a two-year low. Some early losses were pared as investors reasoned that much of the bad news had already been built in to stock values.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said: “It’s not at all surprising that existing home sales were down. It’s not even all that surprising that consumer confidence was off.“If anything, the most damaging thing is the anecdotal retail evidence.”Retail stocks suffered a torrid day after Target lowered its September store sales to an expected rise of 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent, down from a range of 4 per cent to 6 per cent. Its shares closed 4.6 per cent lower at $61.35.The S&P retail index ended the day 2.7 per cent lower at 470.56 but is still trading 4.6 per cent above the low it hit when the credit squeeze began in August. The S&P consumer discretionary index lost 1.2 per cent to 287.36.Lowe’s, the home improvement chain, fell 6.7 per cent to $28.51, after it said slower sales would peg earnings at the low end or slightly below its prior guidance for the year. New consumer data weighed on retail stocks. The US Conference Board index of consumer confidence fell to 99.8 in August versus 105.6 in July, its lowest level since November 2005.Georges Yared, chief investment officer at Yared Investment Research, said: “Are we signalling the bottom in terms of consumer confidence? I think we are close but not quite there yet. The Fed is watching the actions of consumers like a hawk.”Other retail stocks suffered on weaker sentiment for the sector.Home Depot declined 2.4 per cent lower to $33.08, while Wal-Mart slipped 1.8 per cent to $43.16. Macy’s shed 3.2 per cent to $31.91.Housing-related stocks were also in focus after a string of new data.Existing home sales for August declined 4.3 per cent to 5.5m, their lowest level since August 2002. However, the result was slightly better than the 5.44m sales economists had predicted.The backlog of unsold homes climbed 0.4 per cent to 4.58m, the biggest backlog since records began in 1999. Existing home sales have declined in each of the past five months.Lennar posted a loss of $513.9m in the third quarter, versus a profit of $206.7m a year earlier. The loss was well beyond analyst expectations and shares in the homebuilder were down 7.7 per cent.The Case-Shiller home price index for July revealed a 4.5 per cent fall in its 10-city composite. The 20-city composite declined 3.9 per cent over the 12 months through July.Economists at Lehman Brothers said: “The housing market has indisputably taken a turn for the worse, largely due to tighter lending standards and higher borrowing costs. In an ugly feedback loop, buyer sentiment has fallen, putting even more downward pressure on sales and home prices.“We expect prices to ultimately fall more in this cycle than in the early 1990s.”The S&P homebuilders index fell 2.2 per cent to 419.58, while the SPDR homebuilders exchange-traded fund lost 2.6 per cent to $21.52.DR Horton shed 2.1 per cent to $13.28 while KB Home, which reports third- quarter earnings on Thursday, slipped 2.5 per cent to $25.09.Energy stocks were also lower as oil prices fell below $80 in New York and after Saudi Arabia’s oil minister said energy markets are “in turmoil”. The S&P energy index was down 0.9 per cent at 575.82 as US crude future prices shed $1.42 to $79.53 a barrel.
311;HD;Home Depot;2007-09-24T18:23:53Z;Retailers start selling;;Time to tidy up shop. At the first sign of a hiccup in consumer spending, US retailers have started to dump some of their less desirable assets.Home Depot, which already sold its wholesale supply unit for $8.5bn, will now shutter 11 Landscape Supply stores. Nike plans to sell its Nike Bauer Hockey division and review businesses in its “other” category.Nike and Home Depot are making targeted moves. But retailers with less privileged positions in their sectors are chopping off dead weight in an effort to stay competitive. Home goods retailer Pier 1 Imports, a longstanding lossmaker, is dissolving its internet and catalogue sales operations and closing children’s and clearance stores. Circuit City is struggling through a turnround that, among other things, will replace 3,400 of its employees with cheaper, less experienced workers. The companies concerned have consistently cited a renewed focus on profits or “core businesses”. Investor reactions have been less uniform. Nike’s shares rose, thanks to its robust profits and overseas revenue growth. But the already sagging shares of Pier 1 and Home Depot sank further on news of their plans, and Circuit City’s stock plunged 18 per cent in one day.Ahead of a possible retail slowdown, investors are favouring companies that are proactively pursuing strategic goals over those that are struggling to catch up. Nike is selling the hockey business, in spite of its strong results, because it does not fit with the company’s growth plans. In contrast, Circuit City, to stave off rival Best Buy, is attempting a protracted and defensive transformation that has disrupted business, hurt sales and shrunk margins.Even in the good times, there’s a difficult balance between staying lean and exploring new avenues for growth. Now that the slower economy is unmasking failed strategies, expect more retailers to pare down to the bare necessities.
312;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;US retailers worry about subprime impact;;US retailers are increasingly concerned about the effect of Wall Street’s credit squeeze on customers’ spending, according to a survey of 140 chief financial officers.Asked by the consultants BDO Seidman what they thought would have the biggest impact on their business, 25 per cent said the weak housing market, 19 per cent said high interest rates and 15 per cent cited the subprime mortgage crisis.The survey, of retailers with sales greater than $100m, was carried out in August. In the first half of the year, 47 per cent had said high fuel prices were the biggest negative factor.Al Ferrara, retail partner at BDO, said the focus on housing and interest rates “seems to indicate a growing anxiety about a potential credit crunch for consumers”. Given concern with the housing market and recent volatility in the stock market, “discretionary income may dry up and that could have a negative impact on the retail sector as we move into the critical holiday shopping season”.Leading retailers delivered stronger than expected sales in August (a period dominated by back-to-school purchases), according to monthly same-store sales figures released last week.But overall retail sales have been growing more than 1 percentage point slower than last year, which most analysts and retailers attribute to higher energy prices.In addition to the potential reduction in consumers’ discretionary spending, some economists believe pressures on financing could lead to a reduction of low-interest or interest-free financing offers, which have supported sales of cars and electronics.Meanwhile, Home Depot, the second-largest US retailer, said it did not expect to see an improvement in the US housing market “until the back half of 2008”.Carol Tome, Home Depot’s CFO, told an investors’ conference that the retailer had not expected housing inventory to rise to its current levels, and that the subprime mortgage crisis was having a broad impact on the market.It also said on Monday it was still committed to its $22.5bn recapitalisation programme, after completing an initial $10.7bn buy-back, equivalent to almost 15 per cent of its shares.Frank Blake, chief executive, said the retailer would “continue to evaluate financial market conditions and will execute the rest of the plan as soon as practicable”.Home Depot’s plans for further share buy-backs – in spite of raising less than it expected from the sale of its wholesale unit – have raised concerns among some credit market analysts.“This was management’s last chance to acknowledge a more uncertain outlook by tempering its share buyback plans, but it has chosen to push ahead,” said Carol Levenson of Gimme Credit, an independent corporate bond research service.
313;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Home Depot buys back 15% of shares;;Home Depot, the second largest US retailer, on Monday confirmed that it had spent $10.7bn on a buyback of 14.6 per cent of its previously outstanding shares, as part of its ambitious $22.5bn recapitalisation plan.Frank Blake, chief executive, said the retailer was pleased to have completed its initial tender offer, and that it intended to continue with the remaining share repurchases.”We continue to evaluate financial market conditions and will execute the rest of the plan as soon as practicable,” he said.Following the buyback, Home Depot said it was raising its forecast decline in earnings per share for the current fiscal year to a fall of between 7 and 9 per cent, against its previous forecast of 12 to 15 per cent.The retailer has remained committed to the plan to buy back the full $22.5bn as announced earlier this year, despite the difficulties it encountered with its sale of its wholesale Home Depot Supply unit to private equity investors.The company said last month it had reduced the price agreed for that sale by almost 18 per cent to $8.5bn, but would receive only $7.9bn in cash proceeds after agreeing to retain a 12.5 per cent equity stake in the unit.Home Depot also agreed to guarantee $1bn of debt in the newly independent wholesale unit. The remainder of the $11.8bn planned share buybacks are to be funded with additional debt.
314;HD;Home Depot;2007-09-07T01:43:24Z;Toyota luminary to drive Chrysler sales;;Chrysler on Thursday named Jim Press, the respected head of Toyota’s North American operations, as head of the troubled Detroit-based carmaker’s sales, marketing and product strategy.Mr Press’s appointment as vice-chairman and president continues a shake-up at Chrysler since it came under the control last month of Cerberus Capital Management, the New York-based hedge fund.Cerberus has also brought in Bob Nardelli, former head of Home Depot, the building supplies chain, as chairman and chief executive, and recruited a senior executive from Lexus, Toyota’s luxury brand, as chief marketing officer.Mr Nardelli, Mr Press and Tom LaSorda, the former chief executive who also carries the titles of vice-chairman and president, will form a three-man office of the chairman.Mr LaSorda’s responsibilities include manufacturing and labour.Dennis Virag, president of Michigan-based Automotive Consulting, said that, “if Nardelli lets LaSorda and Press do their jobs, it could be the best management team in the business”.However, he said the real question was how they would work together. “Will egos get in the way?”Mr Press, aged 60, capped a 37-year career with Toyota last June by becoming the first foreigner to join the Japanese carmaker’s board.His departure is a blow to Toyota, which is in the midst of an aggressive expansion in North America.But Mr Press’s move is a coup for Chrysler. Sales and marketing have long been one of its weak spots.The company’s relations with its dealers have also been tense over the past year as it has tried to push unwanted inventory into the market.Mr Press also faces the challenge of reinvigorating Chrysler’s product line-up.Chrysler declined on Thursday to disclose Mr Press’s package.
315;HD;Home Depot;2007-09-04T20:51:43Z;Wall St rally led by tech stocks;;"Wall Street stocks rallied on Tuesday, led by a surge in the technology sector, as investors returned from the Labor Day long weekend confident that the Federal Reserve would cut rates this month.Although money market rates rose to new highs on Tuesday since the credit crunch emerged a month ago, equity markets adopted an optimistic stance.“The equity market has locked in the idea of a rate cut and believes the Fed and the [Bush] administration stand behind the economy,” Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said. “There is now a feeling of security and that has relieved the fear seen in recent weeks.”The dominant sector on Tuesday was technology. Analysts said tech stocks were a safe haven from stocks that are exposed to the problems in the mortgage, credit and financial areas.“Tech has zero exposure to subprime mortgages and there are many multinational tech companies that benefit from a weaker dollar,” Mr Pado said.At the close in New York, the Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent higher at 2,630.24 and led the leading benchmarks. The S&P 500 index was 1.1 per cent higher at 1,489.42 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent higher at 13,448,86. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1 per cent to 800.66.While equity investors were looking for rate cuts, economic data on Tuesday showed that the manufacturing sector continued to expand last month.This week’s array of economic reports could bolster market expectations that the Fed will ease policy at its meeting this month.Among economic reports likely to attract close attention from stock market investors is the Fed’s Beige book survey of regional activity, due on Wednesday.“The Fed’s Beige Book could provide insights as to any real economic stresses that might be emanating from the recent financial turmoil,” TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said. Should data not arrive on the weak side, analysts believe the Fed has little choice but to ease policy when it meets on Septem-
ber 18.“The Fed will likely cut rates in order not to upset market expectations of an ease,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners said. “It is imprudent of the Fed to cut as economic numbers show the economy is still growing and there is still some concern over inflation.”Among specific stocks on the move on Tuesday was Apple, up 4.1 per cent to $144.16, a one-month high, after analysts at Piper Jaffray said sales of Macintosh computers exceeded expectations.Ford Motor reported another large drop in sales in August as sales by the battered US car industry appeared poised to be overtaken by import brands for a second consecutive month.Ford said its total US sales fell about 14 per cent to 218,332 in the month, better than some estimates, sending its shares up 2.3 per cent at $7.96. GM sales were up 6 per cent and Chrysler sales were down 6 per cent. Shares in GM rose 3.8 per cent to $31.92.Sales at Japanese rivals such as Toyota Motor, Hondaand Nissan were expected to be higher. The results could again leave domestic brands behind the import brands in US sales, as they were for the first time on record in July.Credit concerns continued to hit sentiment towards the housing sector.Countrywide Financial shares fell slightly at $19.81 and homebuilder Lennar fell 0.1 per cent to $28.24.NovaStar Financial, the mortgage investment company, fell 15.7 per cent to $7.16 after it announced further restructuring, including job cuts, tighter lending and the cancellation of a $101.2m sale of preferred stock.Home Depot shares fell 5.1 per cent to $36.36 after it said it expected to buy back $10.7bn in stock.In deal news, MetroPCS Communications offered to acquire rival Leap Wireless International for about $5.12bn in stock. Leap Wireless soared 15 per cent to $83.47. MetroPCS rose 5 per cent to $28.60.CBS shares rose 0.2 per cent to $31.57 after it said its quarterly dividend would increase 14 per cent from 22 cents a share to 25 cents. The board also approved a $1.6bn stock buy-back plan."
316;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-28T19:50:08Z;Management changes signal ‘New Chrysler’;;Signs of a fresh broom sweeping through Chrysler’s management ranks have begun to emerge with the appointment of three new assembly plant managers and a senior executive to oversee the Detroit carmaker’s recovery plan.The moves come less than a month after Bob Nardelli, former chief executive of Home Depot, the building-supplies retailer, took the reins at the lossmaking carmaker on the heels of its sale to Cerberus Capital Management, the New York private-equity group.Daimler, Chrysler’s former parent, retains a 20 per cent stake.Based on his hard-charging style at Home Depot and, before that, General Electric, Mr Nardelli is widely expected to initiate a shake-up at Chrysler.He said at the time of his appointment this month that, with the carmaker now a private company, “we have the ability to move with speed, we have the ability to move with flexibility”.One Chrysler executive said yesterday that Mr Nardelli had spent the past three weeks mostly listening to employees, dealers and others.He has had several meetings with Ron Gettelfinger, head of the United Auto Workers union.“He’s gone into the bowels of the organisation,” the executive said. “He’s not coming in and going boom, boom, boom.”The new director for recovery, transformation and business strategy is Andreas Schell, who worked for Daimler before moving to Detroit in 2002.Mr Schell, 38, was described by a colleague as “one of the bright lights in this company”.He was previously executive assistant to Tom LaSorda, whom Mr Nardelli replaced as chief executive and is now the company’s president.Chrysler said on Tuesday that the plant managers had not been forced out. One had accepted an early retirement package and another will continue to work part-time for the company. The third had been promoted.But other recent management changes, most notably Mr Nardelli’s appointment, suggest that it will not be business as usual at the carmaker, which now describes itself as the New Chrysler.Eric Ridenour, the company’s chief operating officer, left quietly in the weeks before Cerberus took control.The carmaker this month recruited Deborah Wahl Meyer from Toyota’s luxury Lexus division as chief marketing officer.The recovery plan outlined this year targets a 2.5 per cent return on sales by 2009.
317;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-28T18:49:33Z;Wall St falls sharply as banks sell off;;"Wall Street suffered its worst day of losses in three weeks on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 index closing at its lowest level for the past week after a sell-off in investment banking stocks was aggravated by minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last meeting, which struck a gloomy note on the US housing sector.The S&P 500 closed down 2.4 per cent at 1,432.36 while the Nasdaq Composite was 2.4 per cent lower at 2,500.64.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1 per cent to 13,041.85 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies lost 2.7 per cent to 767.83.There was a renewed stampede to the haven of treasuries, with the yield on the 2-year bill falling 13 basis points to 4.08 per cent.The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index – a measure of equity volatility – rose for a second day after dropping sharply last week.The Vix rose 15.8 per cent to 26.30, suggesting some of the anxiety that has hit Wall Street in recent weeks had returned. The Fed minutes noted the possibility of both a “deeper and more prolonged” downturn in the US housing sector and “a further deterioration in financial conditions” that “could have an adverse effect on growth prospects”.Investment banks were at the vanguard of earlier falls after a report from Merrill Lynch said tighter credit markets would hit earnings at Citigroup, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. Merrill analysts also cut profit estimates for the three banks and lowered their recommendations on their shares to “neutral” from “buy”.The report said 2008 forecasts “appear increasingly unrealistic”, adding that “slower debt, mergers and acquisitions and equity underwriting businesses seem inevitable”.The analysts also reduced JPMorgan Chase’s profit estimate but retained a buy rating on the bank.By the close, shares in Citigroup, the largest US bank, had dropped 3.5 per cent to $46.14, Lehman Brothers, the biggest underwriter of US bonds backed by mortgages, had lost 6 per cent to $54.28 and Bear Stearns, the second-largest bond underwriter, was down 3.4 per cent to $108.42. JPMorgan lost 2.9 per cent to $43.60 while Merrill Lynchfell 3.9 per cent to $72.Markets were digesting mixed economic data. On the upside, consumer confidence fell less than expected in August, according to the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index.“We remain comfortable with the US consumer’s resilience, especially since the consumer has shockingly not been the source of GDP growth,” Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said. “The data suggest that the consumer has been part of the economic growth lately but not its driver as is often misconstrued.”The consumer report was offset by more bad news from the US housing sector.House prices fell 3.2 per cent in the second quarter, according to the S&P/Case-Schiller quarterly index – the steepest decline since Standard & Poor’s began its index in 1987. A separate index of house prices in 20 US cities fell 3.5 per cent in June from a year earlier; a 10-city index fell 4.1 per cent on the year.Robert Schiller, MacroMarkets LLC chief economist, said the decline in the residential property market “shows no signs of slowing down”. The S&P homebuilders index had fallen 4.3 per cent by mid-afternoon.Home Depot shares rose 0.1 per cent to $35.05 after it said it expected $7.9bn in cash from the renegotiated sale to private equity investors of its wholesale unit.PolyMedica rose 14.1 per cent to $51.69 after Medco Health Solutions agreed to buy the provider of diabetes-testing supplies. Medco fell 1.2 per cent to $85.11.Coachmen Industries fell 8.3 per cent to $6.86, after the vehicle-maker suspended its 3-cents-a-share quarterly dividend, saying economic conditions required it to conserve funds.Knight Capital Group fell 9.5 per cent to $13.09 after its hedge fund unit said it might refund performance fees if it posted a loss for the final six months of the year.Sanderson Farms fell 10.6 per cent to $39.20 after the poultry processor posted third-quarter sales below expectations.Xoma rose the most since April 2005, up 17.5 per cent to $2.68 after the drugmaker said it had licensed its antibody technology to Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceuticals group, for an initial $30m and future sales fees."
318;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Private equity lessons;;Runaway booms always mask a raft of questionable activities. The buy-out frenzy was no exception. Problems being exposed by the credit market crunch go beyond the exuberant funding promises that the banks now regret. Home Depot’s renegotiation underlines a few of them.First, there is “stapled finance”. The idea was that banks advising on a sale would also offer financing terms to potential buyers to lubricate the process. That created a conflict of interest by positioning the bank alongside both buyer and seller. In Home Depot’s case, Lehman Brothers advised on selling the supply division, helped provide the financing and then, when the deal looked tenuous, helped to force a renegotiation and price cut. At that point, it was removed as an adviser. But it should never have been on both sides. In a tight spot, the interests of its shareholders were always going to come above Home Depot’s.Second, there is the “too many cooks” syndrome. Having multiple private equity groups and banks leading a buy-out sounds reasonable. It allows bigger deals and spreads risk during a boom. The danger is that having three private equity groups and three banks, as in the Home Depot deal, means multiple views in a crisis. That can be really painful if a completed buy-out runs into trouble.Third, there are reverse break-up fees paid to the seller if a private equity buyer is willing to absorb the cost and reputational damage of walking away. If such fees are not set high enough, buyers, in effect, have an option on actually completing a deal. In Home Depot’s case, the fee was only $300m on a $10.3bn deal.When the dust settles, buyers and sellers will want to re-assess some of the practices that became “normal” when the party was in full swing.
319;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-27T20:40:42Z;Wall St falls on poor homes sales;;Wall Street stocks finished the trading session lower on Monday after a report said sales of existing homes in the US had dropped in July for a fifth consecutive month.Sales were down to their slowest pace in nearly five years while house prices have fallen in every month of the past year.By the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.9 per cent at 1,466.79 points and the Nasdaq Composite had lost 0.6 per cent to 2,561.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 13,322.13 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was 1.2 per cent lower at 789.45.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index – which last week fell more than 30 per cent – gained 9.9 per cent to 22.76.The National Association of Realtors reported sales of previously owned homes declined 0.2 per cent in July, less than forecast, to an annual rate of 5.75m from 5.76m in June. The median price of a house sold in July fell to $230,200, down by 0.6 per cent from a year ago. This marked a record twelfth consecutive month that home prices had declined from a year before.Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said that given that context, “prices would be falling even if all was well in the mortgage market. So in today’s troubled circumstances, we have to expect steep declines for the foreseeable future.”Noting a sharp increase in housing inventory, Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said the report “in combination with credit problems is bound to put significant downward pressure on prices in coming months …We will probably have to await another couple of months to better survey the damage caused by the credit tremors.”Adding to the bearish sentiment, a survey by the National Association of Business Economics showed that economists thought credit worries were more of an immediate threat to the US economy than terrorism. Some 32 per cent of respondents in the National Association of Business Economics study said loan defaults and excessive debt were their chief short-term concerns, while 20 per cent cited terrorism.Countrywide, which has borne the brunt of concerns over subprime mortgagea, lost 4.8 per cent to $20 after Lehman Brothers reduced its 2007 earnings per share estimate for the biggest mortgage lender in the US from $2.80 to $1.00. Lehman cited “extraordinary weakness” in the secondary market for loans held by Countrywide, whose shares have lost more than 50 per cent of their value since mid-May.Continuing pessimism over credit also hit Bear Stearns, which fell 4.2 per cent to $112.20 and Lehman Brothers , whose shares lost 4.3 per cent to $57.75.Shares in Home Depot gained 1.6 per cent to $35.25 after the retailer agreed to sell its wholesale distribution business to a group of private equity firms for $8.5bn, $1.8bn less than originally planned.Wal-Mart was in the spotlight after the Financial Times reported that the world’s biggest retailer was considering making acquisitions in the US for the first time in more than 25 years. The company’s shares closed 0.2 per cent higher at $43.82.Takeover news moved shares in several companies. US Steel fell 0.4 per cent to $93.01 after the company said it would buy Stelco of Canada for about $1.1bn.Chicago Bridge & Iron stock lost 0.2 per cent to $38.12 after it agreed to buy Lummus Global from ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, for $950m.Rio Tinto fell 0.7 per cent to $271.99 after it said it had won US antitrust approval for its $38.1bn purchase of Alcan, the Canadian aluminium producer, whose shares rose 0.6 per cent to $97.96.Shares in First National Bancshares lost 0.1 per cent to $14.73 after it said it had agreed a $59.3m stock-and-cash deal to buy Carolina National, whose shares rose 43.4 per cent to $19.50.Gateway had its biggest rise since its initial public offering in December 1993 after Acer of Taiwan said it would buy the company for $710m, creating the world’s third biggest computer-maker. Its shares leapt 50.4 per cent to $1.82.Altria Group gained 1.3 per cent to $70.08 on the expectation that the cigarette-maker will announce on Wednesdaya spin-off of Philip Morris International.Shares in Neurochem fell 43.2 per cent to $3.16 after the biotechnology company said its Alzheimer’s drug had failed in a clinical trial.
320;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-27T20:17:08Z;Home Depot could set buy-out tone;;For several days last week, Home Depot’s deal to sell its wholesale supply division to a consortium of private equity groups was teetering on the edge of collapse.The investment banks funding the deal were balking because of the credit crisis, while the second-largest US retailer was preparing to inform investors that a key element of its strategy would not be completed.It took a gruelling set of last-ditch weekend talks and the intervention of top Wall Street executives, including Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, and Dick Fuld, of Lehman Brothers, to rescue the sale. The final agreement, which was to be announced on Monday morning, involved a radical redesign of the deal, which was originally unveiled only two months ago.The acquisition price was slashed from $10.3bn to $8.5bn, people familiar with the matter said. Home Depot agreed to other concessions as well, including taking a stake in the division and guaranteeing a portion of the debt.In exchange, the private equity consortium, composed of Bain Capital, Carlyle and Clayton Dubilier & Rice, added nearly $500m of equity to the deal in an effort to make the capital structure less geared and more palatable to the banks.On Monday morning, as the curtain fell on the Home Depot drama, the big question on Wall Street was whether other large, pending leveraged buy-outs would follow a similar plot.On one hand, the prospect of deals collapsing entirely seemed more remote, as it became clear that on all sides there was a willingness to take some pain to avoid damage, both financially and in terms of reputation, of a failed transaction. Yet shares in some of the targets, including Sallie Mae, TXU, Alltel, First Data and Clear Channel, fell in morning trading, as investors were betting that while deals may not fail, they would be recut at lower prices.But getting some of the large leveraged buy-out targets to agree to a recut deal may be much harder than it was in the case of Home Depot.Frank Blake, who took over as chief executive in January after the departure of Bob Nardelli, had made the sale of the non-core supply division a key element of his strategy. The proceeds were earmarked to fund a large share buy-back, and the sale was supported by Relational Investors, the activist investment fund run by Ralph Whitworth that holds a board seat.In addition, the investment banks may not be able to adopt such a tough negotiating stance on other deals because Home Depot’s supply business had deteriorated significantly due to its direct exposure to woes in the housing and construction market. This made it easier for the banks to claim that they could walk away from funding the deal because conditions had changed.Meanwhile, private equity groups executives may look at the Home Depot deal as a sign that they will have to insert more equity into deals. In a curious twist, re-funding their own transactions will be a way for buy-out shops to put money to work in the midst of the credit squeeze.
321;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-27T19:18:38Z;Home Depot face-off;;Home Depot was where the banks finally fought back.For years the juicy fees on offer from financing buy-outs saw them bend so far backwards in order to win private equity business that they had lost their balance. Huge financing commitments on super-favourable terms should never have been agreed even while (in Chuck Prince’s beautifully mistimed words) the music was still playing.Now it has stopped, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers simply threatened not to provide the promised financing for the purchase of Home Depot’s supply business. Given the credit market dislocation they would have taken a big hit immediately. Rather than face a litigation crisis, all sides gave ground.Home Depot appears to be the biggest loser, taking a massive 18 per cent price cut, agreeing to guarantee $1bn of debt and hold on to 12.5 per cent of the division’s equity. The banks agreed to go ahead but will put up less cash and make smaller losses than they would have.The private equity groups come off best. They can play the good guys who wanted to close the deal but were forced to keep chipping away at the price by the nasty banks. True, they get worse debt terms and have to put up more equity, which will affect returns. But that also reduces the financial risk in the deal and, let’s face it, they are paying a full 18 per cent less than they originally agreed.Other huge buy-outs in the system will face pressure from the banks. But they will be tougher to renegotiate. In this case, Home Depot was keen to sell the division for strategic reasons and the buyers could credibly argue the weak housing market had undermined the value of the business. It is less obvious public companies such as First Data will accept deep price cuts, given equity markets are only 5 per cent off their peaks and their businesses are not struggling.Either way, the private equity groups still look best positioned. They can either use the generous financing terms originally offered by the banks or blame nervous lenders if they try to force a cut in the acquisition price.
322;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-27T13:37:15Z;Home Depot to guarantee debt in unit sale;;Home Depot on Monday appeared to have salvaged the sale of its wholesale supply unit to three private equity groups, after slashing the price by nearly $2bn and agreeing to guarantee a portion of the debt.According to people familiar with the matter, the renegotiation of the terms was completed after a gruelling series of talks over the weekend and was due to be announced later on Monday.The fate of Home Depot’s supply business was being closely watched on Wall Street because it could provide a template for the renegotiation of the terms of other large leveraged buy-outs amid the tightening of credit around the world.In the case of Home Depot, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers in effect forced the revision of the terms after balking at financing the original deal, worth $10.3bn in cash, ahead of the scheduled closing last week.Home Depot first agreed to cut the price of the sale to Bain Capital, Carlyle and Clayton Dubilier & Rice to about $9bn, but that was not enough. By Sunday night, the US retailer had to further lower the price, to $8.5bn, agree to guarantee a portion of the debt, and take an equity stake in the business. For their part, the three private equity groups were also expected to add about $150m each of equity to the deal. FT.com on Friday afternoon reported that Home Depot might consider guaranteeing a chunk of the unit’s debt.Home Depot, the private equity buyers and the banks declined to comment.The potential for the Home Depot deal to set a precedent for other transactions meant that some of Wall Street’s top executives, mainly Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan, and Dick Fuld, chief executive of Lehman Brothers, were directly involved in the talks.The outcome means that private equity groups trying to close large takeovers in the pipeline such as the $45bn buy-out of TXU, the $26bn takeover of First Data, and the $27bn acquisition of Clear Channel Communications might be preparing to add more equity to the deals. Targets will also be considering whether they are willing to lower the price of the deal, or guarantee or take on debt like Home Depot did.However, many buy-out executives could view the Home Depot deal as less relevant because the US retailer had made the sale of the non-core supply division a key element of its strategy under Frank Blake, the new chief executive. In addition, the investment banks may not be able to adopt such a tough negotiating stance on other deals because Home Depot’s supply business had deteriorated significantly due to the woes in the housing and construction market. This made it easier for the banks to claim that they could walk away from funding the deal because conditions had changed.
323;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-24T22:24:16Z;Home Depot in possible debt move;;Home Depot could agree to take on or guarantee part of the debt needed to fund the purchase of its wholesale supply unit by private equity, it emerged on Friday as tense talks over the deal continued.The sale of the division to Bain Capital, Carlyle and Clayton Dubilier & Rice was supposed to be completed on Thursday but the crisis in the credit markets caused three investment banks to resist funding the deal.Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan balked at financing the transaction even after Home Depot and the private equity buyers tentatively agreed to lower the price of the sale by more than $1bn to about $9bn in cash.According to people familiar with the matter, a range of solutions are possible, including the possibility that Home Depot might agree to shoulder some of the debt needed to fund the deal.Such an outcome would mirror the deal by which DaimlerChrysler and Cerberus Capital Management agreed to take on $2bn of the debt required to fund the US private equity group’s takeover of Chrysler, the US carmaker, this month.If Home Depot were to guarantee part of the debt it would echo a 2002 episode when Diageo agreed to guarantee $750m of loans to help a private equity consortium buy its Burger King division.However, people who are involved in the talks cautioned that the discussions were at an extremely fluid stage, and that Home Depot could still decide not to pursue either of those options, having already made a significant concession in agreeing to lower the price.There are still fears that the deal could fall apart, setting the stage for what could be a bitter legal battle over who should bear the costs of the failed deal.Home Depot, Merrill, Lehman, JPMorgan, CD&R, Bain and Carlyle declined to comment.Home Depot shares rose 1.9 per cent Friday to $34.68 as investors were more optimistic that the deal would close. The shares had fallen 2.2 per cent on Thursday after news of the banks’ resistance to financing the sale even at a lower price was reported on FT.com.The division’s fate is being closely followed on Wall Street as a test of the ability of buy-out firms to close large takeovers announced this year, when credit markets were healthy.These include the $45bn buy-out of TXU, the Texas-based energy group, by KKR and TPG and the $26bn purchase of First Data, the credit card processing group, by KKR.Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall in New York

following weeks of volatility prompted by fears of a credit crunch.While concerns over the extent of the fall-out from the subprime mortgage crisis continued to weigh on investor sentiment, lower trading volumes and a wait-and-see stance on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy resulted in a more typical August week of a directionless, drifting stock market.Traders were looking ahead to earnings results from the big investment banks. “Probably in mid-September or October we’ll get a sense of who’s taken big hits on credit exposures,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards. “Until then, it’ll be tough for people to feel comfortable.”The S&P 500 finished 1.2 per cent higher for the day and 2.3 per cent up on the week at 1,479.37, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4 per cent for the day and 2.8 per cent higher over the week at 2,576.69.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent on Friday and was up 2.3 per cent for the week at 13,378.87, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained 1.4 per cent for the day and was 1.6 per cent higher for the week at 798.93.Investors were also awaiting the next meeting of the Federal Reserve’s policymaking Open Market Committee on September 18, when most analysts expect an interest rate cut to bring relief to financial markets.A string of job-cut announcements underlined the persistence of difficult conditions in the mortgage sector. Accredited Home Lenders said it had stopped taking US mortgage applications and would eliminate 1,600 jobs, Lehman Brothers announced it would close down BNC Mortgage, its subprime unit, losing 1,200 employees, and HSBC said it was shedding 600 positions from its US mortgage arm.Since the start of the year, more than 40,000 workers have lost their jobs at mortgage- lending institutions, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Construction companies have announced nearly 20,000 job cuts this year while the National Association of Realtors expects membership rolls to decline this year for the first time in a decade.Shares in Accredited were down 10.5 per cent over the week at $6.04 while Lehman Brothers was up 3.9 per cent at $60.37.Investors also continued to be bearish about Countrywide Financial, the US’s biggest mortgage lender, in spite of an announcement by Bank of America that it had ploughed $2bn of new capital into the beleaguered company. Angelo Mozilo, Countrywide Financial’s chief executive, did little to reassure traders when he said on Thursday that the US housing market was “certainly not getting better” and could push the economy into a recession. Shares were down 2 per cent for the week at $21.Shares in Toll Brothers rose 2 per cent for the week to $23.09 in spite of the homebuilder posting sharply lower earnings in its fiscal third quarter and projecting more trouble ahead.Home Depot was in the spotlight after the Financial Times reported that the retailer’s plans to sell its wholesale supply division to a group of private equity buyers could be in doubt because of the reluctance of three investment banks to fund the deal.Reports emerged that the company was prepared to accept $1.2bn less for the business. However, its stock price rose 1.9 per cent for the day after S&P reiterated its strong buy recommendation and finished the week 4.1 per cent higher at $34.68.“While financing remains an issue, we believe the deal will ultimately close,” said analysts at the ratings agency.Several takeover moves suggested there was still some life in the world of mergers and acquisitions, in spite of ongoing credit concerns.MGM Mirage shares rose 19.1 per cent for the week to $83.48 after Dubai World, the investment holding arm of the Dubai government, said it would pay more than $5bn for a 9.5 per cent stake and 50 per cent of the casino operator’s CityCenter development project in Las Vegas.TD Ameritrade and ETrade were reportedly discussing a merger to create a dominant force in the online brokerage sector. ETrade shares closed 5.1 per cent higher for the week at $15.24 while TD Ameritraderose 7.9 per cent to $17.70.Shares in Lowe’srose 12.4 per cent for the week to $30.20 after the retailer reported better earnings than expected."
325;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-23T21:10:02Z;Wall St lower as uncertainty persists;;Wall Street stocks closed lower on Thursday, with markets giving up their early gains as uncertainty over the extent of losses from the subprime mortgage crisis continued to dominate sentiment.The bearish mood quashed an early rally sparked by Bank of America announcing it had ploughed $2bn of new capital into Countrywide Financial, the beleaguered US mortgage group.The S&P 500 finished the day 0.1 per cent lower at 1,462.50, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent at 2,541.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell less than 1 point to 13,235.88 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 1.3 per cent to 788.25.The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index – a measure of equity volatility – retreated 1 per cent to 22.66, more than 26 per cent below last week’s five-year high.Treasury yields initially fell as the market sensitivity prompted a renewed flight to the safety, but later reversed course, with the yield on the two-year note trading 3 basis points higher at 4.216.“The subprime overhang is continuing, even with the BoA deal,” said Joe Gudorf, head of equity trading at Principal Global Investors.“We’re seeing low trading volumes as some people are sitting on their hands while others are still on holiday. The result is that we’re going to continue to tread sideways until something gives us some direction.”Shares in Countrywide, the biggest mortgage lender in the US, rose 0.9 per cent to $22.02 on news of the Bank of America preferred stock purchase. Wachovia and Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co raised their recommendations on the company’s shares to “market perform’’ from “underperform”.However, Angelo Mozilo, Countrywide chief executive, said the housing market was “certainly not getting better” and could push the economy into a recession.Bank of America shares were up 0.4 per cent at $51.83 after S&P reiterated its “strong buy” recommendation on the stock, citing a target price of $63.Keith Horowitz, credit analyst at Citigroup, said Bank of America “has a great dividend yield, a great growth outlook and a fantastic deposit franchise which is very valuable in this environment”.Home Depotwas in the spotlight after the Financial Times reported that the retailer’s plans to sell its wholesale supply division to a group of private equity buyers could be in doubt because of the reluctance of three investment banks to fund the deal. Its shares fell 2.2 per cent to $34.02.Record demand for the latest book in the Harry Potter series helped Barnes & Noble, the world’s biggest book retailing chain, report higher second-quarter profits on Thursday. Its shares gained 2.6 per cent to $35.82.In earnings news, Hormel Foods posted lower earnings for the quarter ending July 29, with net income of $57.4m down from $59.6m a year ago. The maker of Spam luncheon meat cited the higher cost of meat and corn. Its shares closed 1.1 per cent higher at $34.79.Smithfield Foodsreported higher earnings for the quarter to July 29, with profits of $54.5m, up from $24.6m last year. Smithfield stock rose 8.3 per cent to $32.58.Shares in Children’s Place, which operates the Disney Store retail chain in the US and Canada, dropped 16.9 per cent to $27.43 after the company said it had missed several deadlines to refurbish its stores.Limited Brands stock rose 6.5 per cent to $23.69 after the retailer said it would introduce new products such as a reversible bra and more colourful basicsat its Victoria’s Secret stores. However, the company, which operates the Bath & Body Works chain, warned that the retail environment would remain uncertain in the coming months.Impac Mortgage Holdings, the California home lender that suspended some operations this month, fired about 350 employees as part of a cost-cutting plan. Its shares lost 2.4 per cent to close at $1.61.Toll Brothers, which reported better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday, rose further after analysts at JMP Securities upgraded the luxury homebuilder to “market perform” from “market underperform”, citing the company’s long-term potential. Toll shares closed up 2.3 per cent to $22.765, following a 5 per cent gain on Wednesday.Phillips-Van Heusen rose 3.5 per cent to $56.20 after the clothing-maker reported 35 per cent higher second-quarter profits and raised its full-year earnings guidance after the closing bell on Wednesday.In economic news, new claims for unemployment benefits fell to 322,000 last week, according to the US Labor Department, suggesting employment so far remains unaffected by the credit crunch.
326;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-23T18:20:06Z;Home Depot supply deal in doubt;;Home Depot shares slipped on Thursday as plans to sell its wholesale supply unit to private equity hung in the balance amid doubts over the willingness of investment banks to fund the deal, even at a lower price.Over the past few weeks, Home Depot, the second-largest US retailer, has been in talks with Bain Capital, Carlyle and Clayton Dubilier & Rice about a renegotiation of the $10.3bn all-cash deal, which was unveiled in June.New terms would include a lower price, designed to make it easier for Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan to finance the deal amid turmoil in the credit markets.However, people familiar with the negotiations said the investment banks remained reluctant to fund the deal.Last-ditch talks were taking place on Thursday afternoon with the hope that, under pressure, an agreement could be reached, people familiar with the talks said. “They’re trying to work it out,” one person said. An announcement was expected as early as Thursday night.The tough stance adopted by the banks, reported by FT.com on Wednesday night, was followed by a 2.2 per cent drop in Home Depot shares, to $34 on Thursday morning. Home Depot, Merrill, Lehman, JPMorgan, CD&R and Carlyle declined to comment. Bain could not be reached for comment.The outcome of the Home Depot sale will be closely followed on Wall Street as a test of the ability of buy-out funds to close large takeovers announced this year, when credit markets were healthy. The sale of Home Depot’s supply business was seen as especially vulnerable to falling apart or being renegotiated because its fortunes are so closely linked to the struggling housing and construction sectors.This week, First Data Corporation, the payments and credit card processing company, said it remained on track to close its $26bn takeover by KKR in September after receiving all the required regulatory approvals. However, the debt package for the First Data takeover still needs to be sold to investors.One merger arbitrageur on Thursday said that, if the banks balked at financing the Home Depot business, they might set a negative tone for the larger transactions scheduled to be funded in September and October. The “arb” investor, who declined to be named, suggested the banks should take a hit on the Home Depot sale to preserve the value of the rest of their loan portfolios.Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall
327;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Cost pressures force TTI to lift prices;;Techtronic Industries, one of the world’s largest power toolmakers, on Wednesday conceded it was passing on cost increases to retailers for the first time in more than a decade.The move by the Hong Kong-based company highlights the difficulty that even high-end manufacturers are facing in squeezing efficiencies out of their Chinese supply chains.“Unfortunately we’ve had to face the reality of having to increase prices,” Joseph Galli, chief executive of TTI’s appliances unit, said on Wednesday. “We’ve had to talk to our retail partners and pass on pricing.”According to TTI executives, the main cost pressure has come from raw materials, the prices of which have been rising for years but were previously absorbed by increasing efficiencies in the Hong Kong-based company’s global supply chain.That strategy is being tested, however, by across-the-board cost pressures in China, where everything from labour to electricity costs has been increasing at double-digit rates.The final blow came with recent reductions in value-added tax rebates traditionally enjoyed by China-based exporters. “We are hit big-time [by VAT],” said Horst Pudwill, TTI chairman, who established the company in Hong Kong in 1985.TTI, which had revenues last year of HK$21.8bn ($2.8bn), makes power tools and floor-care equipment for retailers such as Home Depot and Sears of the US. It has been on a brand-buying spree since 1999, when it acquired Vax in the UK. Other brands in its portfolio include Ryobi, Milwaukee tools, Dirt Devil and Hoover.Mr Pudwill said the company, which also has manufacturing and assembly facilities in Mexico and the US, was not contemplating a radical restructuring of its global production strategy. “We are not withdrawing any manufacturing from China,” he said. “We are just expanding at a slower pace.”China has consistently defied predictions that cost pressures would eventually slow its export juggernaut.The government’s decision to cut VAT rebates for exporters was expected to prove a drag on July exports. Instead, China posted a near record monthly surplus of $24.4bn. TTI’s experience suggests that even companies adversely affected by the VAT changes have been able to pass on their costs.TTI executives also cautioned that not all the cost pressures that have forced them to raise prices are unique to China. “China is one element in the equation, but the fact that India is consuming a lot of oil and nickel is a factor too,” Mr Galli said.TTI on Wednesday reported a 1.1 per cent increase in net profit to HK$509m on turn-over of HK$11.9bn.
328;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Quarterly sales improve at Lowe’s;;Lowe’s, the second largest US home improvement retailer, said on Monday it had seen better sales in the northeast US during its second quarter, in a possible indication of bottoming of the housing market in the region.Robert Niblock, chief executive, said sales during the quarter reflected the highly regional nature of the housing slump in the US, with its stores in California and Florida faring significantly worse than the rest of its network.“We see a profoundly disproportionate impact in those markets where housing was most stretched during the past several years,” he said.In California, sales at stores open at least a year had experienced double-digit percentage falls during the quarter, against an overall drop of 2.6 per cent for the company’s 1,425 stores.But Mr Niblock said several regions of the northeast “are showing signs of improvement”, with sales falling less than the company’s average.“It is probably a little early to say that housing problems in the northeast are behind us, but our improving results are an encouraging sign,” he said, noting that some of the stronger performance could be attributed to better weather.The company said it had also seen gains in same-store sales in “the many areas of the country where housing did not accelerate at an unsustainable rate over the past several years”.Lowe’s trimmed its earnings per share guidance for the remainder of the year by two cents to $1.97-$2.01.In spite of what Mr Niblock called the challenging sales environment, Lowe’s reported a 9 per cent increase in earnings to $1.02bn during the quarter, with diluted earnings per share up 11.7 per cent at 67 cents. Sales rose 5.8 per cent to $14.2bn.It reported further gains in market share at the expense of its larger rival Home Depot, which last week reported a 15 per cent drop in earnings on a 2 per cent fall in sales.Lowe’s has steadily improved the performance of its stores over the past few years, while Home Depot focused on its ultimately unsuccessful strategy to develop a wholesale business and other initiatives. Home Depot, under its new CEO Frank Blake, has now launched a drive to improve its in-store operations.Lowe’s shares rose almost 7 per cent to $28.74 at lunchtime in New York on the results, which beat Wall Street’s expectations.● A US court on Monday put a block on the $565m merger of Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats, the organic and natural food stores, to allow a review of an appeal by the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC’s initial move to stop the merger on competitive grounds was rejected by a lower court last week.

The Vix was 6 per cent higher for the week overall.Concerns over possible contagion from the US subprime mortgage crisis dominated the week, bringing turbulence to financial and homebuilding stocks.The most headline-grabbing share of the week was Countrywide Financial, the biggest mortgage lender in the US, which bore the brunt of bearish sentiment towards the sector. Several banks and ratings agencies downgraded its stock, with Merrill Lynch warning that the company could face bankruptcy if financing conditions worsened. By Thursday, Countrywide was forced to tap an $11.5bn credit line.The mortgage giant’s stock soared on Friday after Bank of America upgraded its rating, but by the close Countrywide was down 23.1 per cent for the week at $21.43.Other mortgage providers in investors’ sights were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the government-sponsored enterprises pressed for their portfolio caps to be lifted. Fannie’s shares rose 1.2 per cent for the week at $67.25 while Freddie stock was up 2.8 per cent for the week at $63.70.Shares in hedge funds and private equity groups were also hit by the continuing fears over credit.Fortress Investment Group, seen by many as a proxy for the outlook for hedge funds in general, reported a second-quarter loss of $55m this week. The company, which in February became the first hedge fund in the US to go public, saw its stock drop below its initial public offer price of $18.50, closing the week 8 per cent down at $17.57.KKR Financial stock fell 20.2 per cent on the week to $14.40 after the affiliate of the leveraged buy-out firm said it would lose about $40m on a $5.1bn sale of residential mortgages and warned an additional $200m loss could be in the pipeline.Blackstone, the private equity firm that listed in June, released its first quarterly results this week and warned about “challenging financing conditions” in the sector. The share price was down 4.7 per cent for the week at $24.08.The S&P financials index was up 2.8 per cent for the week after leading a late rally that began on Thursday. Goldman Sachs fell 3 per cent over the week to $175 after the bank announced $3bn of new funding for its Global Equity Opportunities fund, which it revealed had lost 30 per cent of its value this year.There were disappointing results from the big retailers. Shares in Wal-Mart, which cut its full-year earnings outlook citing the housing slump, were 5.6 per cent lower for the week at $43.49.Home Depot reported an expected 14.8 per cent decline in its quarterly earnings as sales declined and warned that the home improvement market would remain tough into 2008. Its stock was 7.2 per cent lower for the week at $33.31.In technology, Applied Materials fell 4.8 per cent for the week to $20.80 after the bellwether semiconductor machine maker reported that profit fell 7.5 per cent in its fiscal third quarter.Shares of VMware, the software maker, soared on its debut in one of the most anticipated initial public offerings of the year. The stock gained $22, or 76 per cent, to $51 on its Tuesday debut. By Friday’s close, it was 91.6 per cent above its IPO price at $55.55.
330;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Global outlook pays dividends;;When Isaac Merritt Singer set up a branch of his sewing machine maker in Paris in 1855, he probably did not think he was blazing a trail US companies would still be following more than 150 years later. Singer’s expansion in France turned the New York-based company into the first US multinational, pioneering a business model that would be adopted by other icons of American capitalism, from Ford to Standard Oil to General Electric.But perhaps the most important legacy of Singer’s daring move was that it worked: within six years of the French opening, foreign sales had exceeded US revenues. It is a lesson not lost on today’s corporate leaders.As the US economy is squeezed by a housing slump, credit turmoil and higher fuel prices, a gap has opened up between companies with large overseas operations and those focused on the domestic market. The second-quarter results season drawing to a close has provided the starkest evidence yet of this trend.Over the past three months, blue-chips such as General Electric, the conglomerate, IBM, the technology giant, and UPS, the logistics group, have hitched a ride on a global economy growing faster than the US. By contrast, companies that depend on dom­estic consumers such as Wal-Mart, the retail bell-wether, and Home Depot, the do-it-yourself chain, have released disappointing results and gloomy predictions.“US companies are in the midst of an unprecedented boom in global earnings,” wrote Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist for Bank of America, in a recent note to clients. “The second-quarter earnings season was a tale of two earnings: robust overseas earnings …versus weak/soft domestic earnings”.This dichotomy has been reflected in US stock markets, particularly during the past few weeks as investors have run for cover from domestic woes. After monitoring more than 40 stock-picking techniques, Merrill Lynch analysts concluded that buying shares in S&P500 companies with the highest percentage of international sales was the second-best performing investment strategy this year.But if foreign earnings have helped US multinationals stave off a fall in profitability, the question is whether the current reliance on the rest of the world is just a cyclical phase or the harbinger of a transformation in corporate America.Could the importance of overseas markets destroy – as Sam Palmisano, IBM’s chief executive, has argued – the old multinational model whereby companies decentralised manufacturing and sales operations but kept key functions such as the executive office, research and product design in the “home country”? And if so, are some US companies ready to become truly “transnational” by scattering their top executives around the world?At first sight, there are significant cyclical forces behind the recent rise of US multinationals – forces, in other words, that could change in the near future.First, the dollar has lost nearly a third of its value against America’s largest trading partners over the past seven years, making it easier for US exporters to sell to the world and boosting the dollar value of overseas earnings.Second, US multinationals have been boosted by global economic growth, which has largely been driven by emerging markets hungry for infrastructure and consumer goods – two of America Inc’s strongest suits.But macro-economic and trade factors are only part of the reason overseas profits of US companies are about to register a record 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. US executives argue that they are reaping the benefits of decades of investment aimed at shifting their companies’ centre of gravity away from the domestic market.“This is not something that has just happened,” says David Abney, chief operating officer of UPS, a company that, with its main rival FedEx, is both a chief beneficiary and key facilitator of global trade. “We first saw it coming 30 years ago and began redoubling our efforts after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent collapse of trade barriers around the world.”Building a business that spans time zones and countries, not to mention myriad customers, government regulations and cultures, is neither easy nor quick. Alexander Cutler, chief executive of Eaton, the diversified manufacturer, recalls that when he took over in 2000, its overseas operations were struggling. “We had these foreign outposts that were supposed to defeat the cyclicality of the US business but we had soldiers dying on the ramparts every day,” he recalls. After an extensive period of rebuilding, Eaton now derives nearly half of its revenues from outside the US.For some experts, such radical transformations have been more common among US companies than their foreign rivals for two key reasons: corporate America’s constant need to satisfy demanding investors and the presence of fewer regulatory and labour constraints in a country renowned for its free-market spirit.But even if economic changes and internal revolutions at companies mean, in the words of Steve Mills, head of IBM’s global software business, that “things cannot go back to the way they were”, will more companies abandon national allegiance and become truly “a-national”?“Big Blue” – as IBM is known – claims to be just that, with operations in more than 150 countries and key functions spread around the world. Its head of procurement, for example, is based in Shenzhen, China, half a world away from Mr Palmisano’s headquarters in Armonk, New York. “Ours is a boundary-less way of thinking,” says Mr Mills.”Halliburton, the oil services group run by Dick Cheney before he became US vice-president, recently followed the petrodollars trail and moved its chief executive from Houston to Dubai.However, many US chief executives regard such moves as impractical, if not outright dangerous. They argue that being rooted in the US is not only an insurance policy in case the globalisation tide turns, but also a way of maintaining order and focus in increasingly complex and dispersed enterprises – of letting everybody know where the buck stops and who is in charge.Jeffrey Immelt, who heads GE, one of the most “global” companies in the US, recently distilled this view: “We’re an American company but in order to be successful we’ve got to win in every corner of the world.”In other words, global aspirations tinged with national pride – which Singer would have understood – is just as recognisable to­­d­ay among US business leaders.
331;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-15T15:05:53Z;Macy’s adds to US retail gloom;;Macy’s, the department store operator, on Wednesday became the latest US retailer to forecast gloom in upcoming quarters, when it reported poor profits and cut its full-year outlook.The chain - which also operates Bloomingdales - earned $74m or 16 cents per share in the second quarter, compared with $317m or 57 cents per share a year earlier.Furthering the pessimistic tone struck by giant retailers Wal-Mart and Home Depot, Macy’s cut its full-year expected earnings-per-share by 30 cents to a range of $2.15 to $2.30.On Tuesday, Wal-Mart cut profit forecasts and Home Depot said poor market conditions would continue into 2008, after both retailers reported weak earnings.The quarter’s results were “below our initial expectations,” said Macy’s chairman Terry Lundgren, but maintained an upbeat tone for upcoming quarters.“We are optimistic that our business can and will improve in the second half of the year, despite what appears to be a more challenging economic environment.”Same-store sales for Macy’s in the quarter were 2.6 per cent lower than last year at $5.9bn, below the company’s guidance of $6bn to $6.1bn provided at the end of the first quarter.Last week, Macy’s reported a 1.4 per cent year-on-year fall in July sales while retail sales across the US grew by 3.2 per cent from 2006.Macy’s share price was up 2.1 per cent at $32.40 in early trading.The 2005 acquisition of May’s department stores continued to dog the company’s earnings, costing Macy’s $97m in the quarter alone. In the full year, it expects to spend between $150m and $160m in merger-related costs.The $17bn takeover more than doubled the number of Macy’s stores across the nation, but has strained the company’s resources in economically difficult times, as consumers seemed more reluctant to spend amid a record housing slump and high energy costs. The company at the time said it expected to spend a total $1bn on the merger into 2008.
332;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-14T22:50:31Z;Housing woes continue to dog Home Depot;;Home Depot on Tuesday ext­ended its pessimistic outlook, saying sales would continue to suffer in the second half of the year and that it expected bleak market conditions to stretch into 2008.The second-largest US retailer has been hit by the US housing market downturn, leading it to warn on profits last month.Last week the company said the $10.3bn sale price for its wholesale unit could be cut at the request of the private-equity buyers as a result of the turmoil in the credit markets.On Tuesday, the Atlanta-based company reported a 15 per cent fall in second-quarter earnings to $1.6bn, or 81 cents per share, primarily because of poor sales. In the three months to July, same-store sales fell by 5.2 per cent from last year.“We believe the housing and home improvement markets will remain soft into 2008,” said Frank Blake, chairman and chief executive. He said the worst depression in the housing market in 16 years continued to present a “tough selling environment” for the home improvement retailer.Carol Tomé, chief financial officer, said: “Beginning of the year, we thought recovery would happen by the end of this year.” But based on what builders and market researchers are saying, “it doesn’t look like it,” she told the FT.Home Depot said it expected continued difficulty in sales for the rest of the year. It reiterated its outlook of a 15-18 per cent fall in full-year earnings per share.But some analysts struck a more upbeat note. Jay McCanless of FTN Midwest said earnings may pick up next year despite a tough market, as the company buys back shares and adopts new sales techniques.Home Depot’s shares closed down 4.9 per cent at $33.52.
333;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Commodities prices remain volatile;;Commodities prices remained volatile on Tuesday as turbulence in the global credit markets continued, with the base metals complex particularly badly hit.Tin, the metal used for soldering in the electronics industry, lost more than 8 per cent on the day.The concerns were exacerbated after a number of Canadian money trusts were not able to issue new commercial paper and Sentinel, a money market mutual fund firm for commodities, sought to stop client redemptions.Base metals were down despite a fall in London Metal Exchange warehouses inventories. David Thurtell, a metal analyst at BNP Paribas in London, said the base metals market was suffering from “renewed turmoil in the credit and equities markets.”Home Depot, the US home improvement retailer, said its profit fell 15 per cent in the second quarter, reinforcing concerns that the US housing slump would dent demand for base metals such as copper and aluminium.In late afternoon London trading, copper was down 1.8 per cent at $7,420 a tonne while aluminium was 1.4 per cent lower at $2,458 a tonne. Nickel shed 1.4 per cent to $27,110 a tonne and lead fell 0.3 per cent to $3,010 a tonne.Tin plunged 8.3 per cent to $14,100 a tonne. “Tin has had two pretty good weeks and profit-taking and technically-driven trading is pushing it down,” Mr Thurtell said. The metal last week reached an all-time high of $17,050 a tonne.Crude oil prices were volatile with fears of Tropical Storm Dean providing support. The US National Hurricane Center said the storm could become a hurricane before the end of the week. However, it is still too early to forecast if Dean would head to the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico, said Daniel Guertin of Lehman Brothers.Nymex September West Texas Intermediate was up 43 cents to $72.05 a barrel while ICE September Brent was down 15 cents to $70.08 a barrel.The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries warned in its monthly oil market report that “the more bearish economic trend which has materialized in recent weeks could negatively impact oil demand growth in the second half of the year.”However, Opec raised its estimate for crude oil demand in the third quarter to 31.1m barrels a day, up from 30.8m b/d in last month report. Opec meets in September to decide its output policy for the winter.
334;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-14T21:08:18Z;Wall St falls sharply amid volatility;;Wall Street closed sharply lower on Tuesday as there was a return of the bearish sentiment and volatility spikes that have hurt stocks in recent weeks.Continuing credit concerns were aggravated by a warning from Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, on its trading outlook and mixed economic data.The S&P 500 index closed down 1.8 per cent at 1,426.54 – its lowest level since the sell-off began in early August – while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.6 per cent off at 13,028.92. The Nasdaq Composite was 1.7 per cent lower at 2,499.12.Financial and homebuilding stocks led the slide with the S&P financials index easing 2.4 per cent, the S&P investment bank index falling 3.9 per cent and the S&P homebuilders’ index dropping 4.8 per cent.Analysts said a good signal of the mood was the share movement of Fortress Investment Group, which in February became the first hedge fund in the US to go public. The company’s stock dropped by 6.6 per cent to $19.22 on Tuesday after it reported a second-quarter loss of $55m on falling revenues and higher compensation costs. Fortress is seen by many as a decent proxy for the outlook for hedge funds in general.Shares in Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, continued to suffer from flagging confidence in the sector, closing at its lowest level for the year, down 8.1 per cent on the day at $24.46.Ongoing unease over credit also hit Wall Street investment banks. Shares in Lehman Brothers fell by 6.3 per cent to $53.67, Goldman Sachs lost 4.4 per cent to $169.75 and Merrill Lynch dropped 3 per cent to $71.34.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which last week performed better than the leading indices, was down 2.2 per cent on the day – a 3.3 per cent fall since the start of the week.The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index – a measure of investor expectations of equity volatility – rose 4.5 per cent to 27.77. Given the jittery trading conditions, some analysts had feared a sharper rise. “Pressure on equities was curiously sanguine,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior analyst at Interactive Brokers. “Still, the fear gauge is building quite some head of steam as traders seem prepared to pay higher insurance against continued volatility.”In earnings news, Wal-Mart reported a 49 per cent jump in second-quarter profit but cut its full-year earnings outlook. By the close of trading, the company’s shares were 5.1 per cent lower at $43.82.Shares of VMware, the software maker, soared on its debut in one of the most anticipated initial public offerings of the year.The stock gained $22, or 76 per cent, to $51 on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the most successful stock market debut this year in terms of one-day gains.Among other technology stocks, STEC was one of the strongest performers.The memory chipmaker raised its third-quarter earnings and revenue forecasts on Monday. On Tuesday, its share price rose by 9.2 per cent to $7.37. GigaMedia was also strong, rising 10.8 per cent to $11.94 after the software developer posted better-than-expected second-quarter results.Qwest shares rose 0.6 per cent to $8.55 after Lehman Brothers upgraded the telecommunications company to overweight from equal weight following the appointment of a new chief executive on Monday.In economic news, the producer price index rose 0.6 per cent in July compared with an expected 0.2 per cent gain and more than reversing a decline of 0.2 per cent in June. The core PPI, which excludes food and energy, rose at a slower pace, up 0.1 per cent after a gain of 0.3 per cent in June. In the 12 months to the end of July, headline PPI rose 4 per cent while the annualised core rate was 2.3 per cent higher.That was the highest year-on-year rate for the core PPI since September 2005.Meanwhile, the US trade deficit narrowed more than expected in June, with exports buoyed by a weaker dollar and a strong global economy, offsetting a record level of imports.The data helped spark a reversal in stock futures.By the close, the effective Fed funds rate was trading at 4.5 per cent, below the central bank’s target rate of 5.25 per cent. Traders were waiting to see whether the US Federal Reserve would inject further liquidity into the system or even seek to drain some of the reserves.“Anything from another token RP [repo] to a small set of reverses is possible this morning, depending both on the level of the funds rate and on overall money market conditions,” said Lou Crandall, economist at Wrightson ICAP.On Monday, the Fed injected just $2bn into the repurchase market. That meant $36bn of Friday’s massive $38bn funding expired.“There is credit tiering going on in the market and this will not likely be solved with the Fed’s current strategy of supplying funds in the overnight market,” said RBC Capital Markets.On Tuesday, overnight Libor was set at 5.40875 per cent, down 36 basis points from its setting for Monday.But longer-dated money market rates remained elevated. The three-month London Interbank Offered Rate was set at 5.53 per cent early on Tuesday. That was down from Monday’s setting of 5.55750 and Friday’s peak of 5.5750 per cent.Still, the three-month floating rate was trading about 12 basis points above the Funds rate prior to the worries over financing emerging last week.“The Fed doesn’t concern itself with Libor in any official way but the Desk might be more inclined to view market conditions as being tight if the Libor fixings did not start to converge with the expected path of short-term rates today,” said Lou Crandall at Wrightson ICAP.On Monday, the S&P finished lower by 0.1 per cent at 1,452.92, falling 1 per cent from its intra-day high. The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.1 per cent at 2,542.24, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.02 per cent at 13,236.53.In contrast, the Nasdaq 100 index of large technology companies closed up 0.5 per cent.The Russell 2000 index of small firms initially rallied and then declined 2.5 per cent from its high for the day. By the end of trading, the Russell was down 1.1 per cent.
335;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-14T20:29:14Z;‘Economic pressures’ hit Wal-Mart profit;;The gloom surrounding the US economy intensified on Tuesday as Wal-Mart and Home Depot, the country’s two largest retailers, said they had been shunned by consumers struggling with a housing slump and higher fuel prices.The poor performance by an economic bellwether such as Wal-Mart, which missed Wall Street’s second-quarter expectations and cut profits forecasts for the year, surprised investors. Its shares tumbled more than 5 per cent – their biggest fall in more than five years – during New York’s morning session.The downbeat tone struck by the two large retailers, which echoed recent warnings by rivals such as Sears and housebuilder DR Horton, deepened investor concerns that the housing market woes were spilling over to an ever-larger part of the economy.Consumer spending has been one of the main drivers of economic growth, but it has shown signs of abating in recent months as homeowners feel the pinch of rising mortgage rates and higher living costs.Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, cut the company’s full-year profits forecasts by about 3 per cent and predicted tough times ahead for consumers squeezed by the crisis in the housing market and rising fuel prices.“US consumers continue to be under difficult pressure economically,” he said. “It is no secret that many customers are running out of money toward the end of the month.”Wal-Mart has slashed prices on thousands of back-to-school items and discontinued a number of higher-price lines.However, the moves had a negative impact on margins – a sign that Wal-Mart could find it difficult to return to its roots as a low-cost retailer without hurting profits during the downturn.Home Depot, directly exposed to the housing market woes, was even gloomier, saying that rising interest rates and slowing home sales had prompted consumers to defer expenditure on home improvements.Frank Blake, the retailer’s recently appointed chief executive, reiterated the company’s forecast for a year-on-year fall of up to 15 per cent in 2007 and warned that the “soft conditions” would persist into 2008.
336;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-14T18:54:26Z;Wal-Mart’s warning;;Most chief executives grab any opportunity to thump the table about record sales and earnings. Not so Lee Scott, chief executive of Wal-Mart. Announcing the US retailer’s second-quarter results on Tuesday, he brushed aside the big headline numbers. Instead, he focused on the weaknesses that led Wal-Mart to miss consensus forecasts and modestly downgrade its full-year guidance.Mr Scott’s candour is welcome but, given Wal-Mart’s bellwether position, depressing for investors. There are some specific problems, for example, in the company’s apparel lines. Wal-Mart is also trying to reconnect with its core US consumer base, typically those on a tight budget. Mass price cuts, aimed at clearing inventory backlogs, are also intended to re-establish Wal-Mart’s leadership in discount retailing.The problem is that the company is reconnecting at a time when many of those same customers are struggling to stretch their wages to the next payday. Less-skilled workers, even as they benefit from cheaper goods (sold in Wal-Mart for example), are at the sharp end of globalisation in terms of wages and jobs. Meanwhile, Home Depot’s results, also reported on Tuesday, bore testament to the housing slump. High healthcare, energy and food bills also cut into shopping budgets.As a medium-term strategy, asserting yourself as the discount retailer of choice as the economy weakens makes sense but offers little encouragement in terms of boosting near-term profits. For the US economy, there are two other implications. First, this will add to siren calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates although, in retort, it can point to the inflationary impact of those higher energy and healthcare costs. Second, the news is a reminder of the pressures faced by ordinary Americans – and came on the same day that Mattel announced another safety recall for Chinese-made toys. Wal-Mart’s struggles are grist to the protectionist mill.
337;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-13T18:02:24Z;Music over for buy-out buccaneers;;In the last week of July, executives at Blackstone and KKR were rocked by a new and unsettling experience. As the private equity groups entered the second round of bidding for yet another huge leveraged buy-out – the $16bn (£8bn, €12bn) purchase of Cadbury Schweppes’ US drinks business – the deal kept getting more expensive.What was happening? Each time the buy-out funds checked in with Morgan Stanley, Cadbury’s adviser, the bank ratcheted up the interest rate on the debt package, according to people close to the matter. For the private equity titans, this unusual behaviour was a confirmation of their worst fears: the world had fundamentally changed, and not in their favour.Credit markets were in turmoil as a crisis in subprime mortgages spread to other risky loans and bonds, sending hitherto voracious buyers such as hedge funds running for cover. As a result, banks such as Morgan Stanley, which had been enthusiastic providers of credit for daring buy-outs, were struggling to parcel out debt that had, until then, fuelled an unprecedented private equity boom.By July 27 the Cadbury “staple”, as a debt package assembled by the adviser to a seller is called, had been unstitched. Although the package had technically not been withdrawn, Morgan Stanley, along with Cadbury’s other advisers at UBS and Goldman Sachs, decided that the credit crisis made it impossible to price, say people close to the matter. Shortly after, the British drinks and confectionery group postponed the landmark sale indefinitely.That moment could be etched into the memory of buy-out executives for years to come. Just days after Chuck Prince, ­Citigroup’s chief executive, had confidently proclaimed that he was “still dancing” to the tune of the buy-out boom, the music stopped and the self-proclaimed “golden age” of private equity came to an end.Indeed, since the end of July, discussions about large private equity takeovers have virtually ground to a halt, say Wall Street bankers. “Nobody is doing deals,” says John Howard, chief executive of the merchant banking unit at Bear Stearns. “Everybody is saying ‘Let’s wait until after Labor Day [September 3]’ but I’m not sure that is long enough.”For once, the trademark self-assurance of the buy-out chieftains seems to be waning – not helped by Blackstone’s humbling experience since becoming the first large US private equity group to go public in June. The group had the unenviable task on Monday of releasing results to investors, which include a high-powered Chinese government agency, with its share price some 30 per cent below its first day’s close.Investors’ disappointment has been compounded by the realisation that the listing came at a perfect time for Blackstone’s executives, who received billions of dollars by selling out just before the beginning of a bear market for buy-outs.However, ill-fated private equity listings and the disappearance of several multi-billion-dollar buy-outs are only the first consequences of the meltdown in credit markets. The convulsions in the bond market have also brought forward what many consider to be the most crucial test for private equity groups in their climb up the ranks of global finance.After the immense success of the past few years, when leveraged deals often generated huge gains, returning billions of dollars to private equity executives and their investors, will private equity groups successfully weather a downturn? If they do, moreover, will they have the expertise and ability to continue producing the high returns to which their pension fund investors have grown accustomed?To answer those questions, private equity executives are first scrambling to assess what the rules of the buy-out game will be in a few months’ time. Some insist that the current jitters are temporary and that the underlying factors that have driven the boom conditions, such as increased risk appetite from investors around the world, will return. But most buy-out chiefs are preparing for a long-term reversal of the trends of the past 18 months.Whereas buy-out groups have so far focused on pursuing large LBOs such as the $49bn takeover of BCE, the parent of Bell Canada, or the $45bn buy-out of TXU, the Texas-based energy group, they are now expected to rediscover the value of smaller deals involving less debt.Similarly, while banks had been willing to accept few or no covenants on their loans for large takeovers, the first deals after the shake-out are likely to feature the tightest of lending standards to insure bondholders against volatile markets.With the debt markets being so feeble, private equity groups may also be forced to diversify their strategies and pursue minority equity investments in listed companies, such as last year’s $3bn investment by Blackstone in Deutsche Telekom.Finally, some private equity groups may choose simply to sit out the bear market. “Given the amount of money that has been invested in the last 18 months, sitting on the sidelines will be easy through 2007 and probably welcomed by private equity investors,” says John Coyle, global head of financial sponsors at JPMorgan. “Of course, sooner or later, some will get itchy to spend again but I would think most have plenty of portfolio companies to keep them busy for a fairly long while.”Indeed, rather than finding new places to invest money, the biggest challenge for the buy-out industry in the changing environment will be managing portfolios of companies acquired during the boom. Long before the first signs of souring debt markets appeared in June, buy-out executives claimed to have found the recipe for strong returns in all environments. They were no longer pure financial engineers, they argued, but long-term investors with the expertise to foster turnrounds at even the most troubled of companies.To back up this view, buy-out executives proudly reeled off the names of former chief executives of public companies whom they had hired to inject operational expertise into their empires. The latest addition to that list came last week, when Cerberus Capital Management hired Bob Nardelli – the former General Electric executive who resigned as chief executive of Home Depot after spats with shareholders earlier this year – to run Chrysler in the wake of its $7.4bn buy-out of the US carmaker.Private equity groups’ claims to have gained enough know-how to run their companies in lean times will be tested by the current tough markets. In particular, the private equity takeover model – buying companies with debt secured against their assets – could come under severe strain at times of bond market turmoil. With the shutters down on credit markets, buy-out funds will not be able to execute the swift “recapitalisations” that had become a common feat of financial engineering during the boom.Put simply, recapitalisations involve the exchange of the debt raised during the takeover with cheaper, less onerous obligations provided by fee-hungry lending banks. Although controversial, especially among bondholders, the practice enabled buy-out funds to recoup most of their investment shortly after a takeover. That, in turn, left the proceeds from the eventual sale of the company as pure profit, supercharging the returns of private equity groups and reducing the importance of a successful operational turnround.With the equity markets sliding, buy-out funds are losing the implicit guarantee that companies bought today could be sold at a higher price in the future.“If you buy a company at six times earnings and you sell it at eight times earnings two years later because that is where the equity markets are, it is very difficult not to make money,” argues Hugh Macarthur, the head of the private equity practice at the management consultancy Bain & Company (which no longer has any ties to the buy-out fund Bain Capital).Indeed, Bain estimates that returns on deals struck over the past few months – when the booming debt markets prompted buy-out funds to place high valuations on their takeover targets – could be up to 50 per cent lower than during previous cycles. Such a performance would be an indictment of the industry, suggesting that its fabled high returns were largely due to the benign influence of overly accommodating debt markets.Private equity groups reply that seasoned industrialists such as Jack Welch, the former head of General Electric now advising Clayton Dubilier & Rice, and Lou Gerstner, the former IBM chief now chairing Carlyle, will provide the experience to steer portfolio companies through these troubled times. Younger managers such as David Calhoun, a former GE star who moved to the private equity-owned media group Nielsen last year and, to an extent, Mr Nardelli, have been hired to inject a new lease of operational drive and hands-on leadership in their companies.Even KKR – the firm that pioneered financially engineered deals – decided to revive its in-house management consultancy Capstone in 1999 to wring out costs and push through efficiencies at newly acquired groups. Bain Capital has bolstered its team of operational experts from about 10 to 40 since the start of the decade.As Mr Welch told the FT last week, the private equity industry realises that “with the credit tightness and risk adjustment that is going on right now, operations are the way out of the current issues”.Yet it is far from certain that focusing on the nitty-gritty of their companies’ business will help buy-out funds to reap the same rewards as loading them up with cheap debt and selling them into buoyant equity markets. The task is made all the more difficult by the fact that, unlike during the previous cycle when private equity groups focused on down-at-heel companies, this time they have paid up for larger and more successful groups.It might be tough, for example, for Blackstone to add significant value to a company such as Hilton Hotels, whose market capitalisation has more than doubled and profits nearly quadrupled in the three years before its $26bn buy-out in July.“Being operationally focused in the 1980s was much easier: there was a lot more fat in the 1980s,” argues Andrew Metrick, associate professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.That is why most private equity executives are nervously watching the US and global economy. A prolonged and sharp slowdown would make it harder to improve earnings at their portfolio companies, forcing them to delay divestitures and lowering their returns.So far the economy is co-operating: earnings at most US companies are holding up despite the credit maelstrom. In addition, the golden era of the past few years has left private equity groups with a silver lining: creditors have much less power than in the past to call in dues.The spread of “covenant-lite” takeovers – deals with few or no financial triggers for debt repayments even when the business fundamentals deteriorate – has given companies and their private equity masters an extra cushion against full-blown crisis.“The deals of the past few years are much less fragile than they were in the 1980s,” says Steven Kaplan at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. “The use of covenant-lite structures means that barring a catastrophic occurrence, you are going to see much fewer defaults than in the late 1980s.”That is indeed the hope of many private equity leaders as they survey the rapid unravelling of the conditions that ensured their recent meteoric rise to the top of global capitalism.A veteran of many political and financial battles, former Treasury secretary John Snow, now chairman of Cerberus, believes the current predicament will try private equity’s mettle. “For creative private equity people this is the time for the old saying ‘You don’t test the captain until you’re sailing in rough seas,’” he says. Investors and companies must hope the once-fêted skippers can avoid the icebergs ahead.
338;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-12T19:38:50Z;Nardelli set to lay spectres of past to rest;;"In a rollercoaster career, Bob Nardelli’s recall last week from corporate purgatory to head Chrysler, the troubled carmaker, must be regarded as an up.But even in his latest moment in the spotlight – being tasked with leading one of the most high-profile turnrounds in corporate America – Mr Nardelli was haunted by the spectre of past failures.As experts and the media recalled his inglorious ousting from retailer Home Depot in January and the criticism of his princely $210m payout that followed, it was easy to forget that Mr Nardelli had been in this situation before. Indeed, his entire career seems to have been marked by a burning desire to overcome periodic failures and prove that his huge confidence in his abilities could be borne out by achievements.Mr Nardelli, 59, declined to be interviewed, but those who know him say that is how he reacted to one of his first major disappointments; being told, in the early 1970s, that his small stature prevented him from becoming a professional football player.With dreams of sporting stardom in tatters, Mr Nardelli graduated (comfortably but without distinction), married his sweetheart Susan, and joined the company where his father had worked all his life – General Electric.Once at the industrial conglomerate, the young Nardelli, armed with an ambition as prodigious as his work ethic, spent more than a decade rising through the ranks – until he was hit by his next setback.In 1988, aged 40, Mr Nardelli, then a middle-ranking executive, asked Jack Welch, GE’s legendary leader, for a general management role.It would have been a big promotion and Mr Welch refused. Mr Nardelli did not take the rejection well, promptly quitting for Case Corporation, a much smaller industrial group.But within three years he was back at the mothership, beginning a whirlwind decade that turned him into one of GE’s brightest stars.As well as turning around the company’s locomotive and power systems units, he also distinguished himself for quirkier innovations, such as the establishment of an internship programme for former military officers at the locomotive business.Mr Welch says the idea was a success because, unlike civilians, former soldiers were not put off by the idea of working in Eerie, the Pennsylvanian backwater where the business was based. But it also underlined Mr Nardelli’s desire for discipline and unswerving obedience – features that contributed to his reputation as an aloof and imperious leader at Home Depot, where he set up a similar programme for military personnel.Mr Welch, who has known him since the late 1970s, disputes this characterisation. “This idea that Bob is a unidimensional, slash-and-burn people-hater is crazy,” he said. “He is a prodigious worker and a great leader that has always inspired loyalty among his people.”Whatever character flaws Mr Nardelli might have had, they did not hinder him at GE, where he got to the brink of netting the job he had coveted for most of his adult life – succeeding Mr Welch at the top of GE. In 2000, when Mr Welch told Mr Nardelli that he had lost out to the more suave and, at least outwardly, brainier Jeffrey Immelt, he was both incredulous and inconsolable. Mr Welch did not provide an “autopsy” of the decision, saying: “I followed my gut.”The controversy that engulfed Mr Nardelli at Home Depot and overshadowed his leadership during a period of improving sales and profits at the retailer, led most observers to conclude that Mr Welch’s intestine had been spot on.But, not for the first time, Mr Nardelli dug deep and set about proving his many doubters wrong. Starting this week he has another – perhaps last – chance to do just that."
339;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-10T18:47:16Z;Wall St falls on liquidity fears;;Wall Street looked on course to close lower on the day on Friday, completing a turbulent week during which an early rally was pared by increasing worries about contagion from the US subprime sector, but markets appeared set to gain overall for the week.By mid-afternoon, the S&P 500 was 0.8 per cent up for the week at 1,443.90, the Nasdaq Composite Index was up 0.8 per cent to 2,532.48 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent on the week to 13,163.21.However, all the indices were down on the day. The Dow fell 0.8 per cent, the S&P 500 was 0.6 per cent lower and the Nasdaq fell 0.9 per cent.On Thursday, the Federal Reserve joined the European Central Bank to intervene in the market, raising more fears of a liquidity crunch and failing to curb bearish sentiment. The Federal Reserve injected further liquidity into the banking system on three occasions on Friday.The week saw a surge in volatility. The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index – a measure of equity volatility – hit a 52-week high of 29.84 in early trade on Friday before moderating slightly. By midday, the index was trading up 15.4 per cent for the week at 29.04.“Volatility is here to stay,” said Doug Peta, markets strategist at J&W Seligman. “The Vix is going to stay well above 20. We’re going to look back at the days when the Vix was below 15 as an aberration.”Financial stocks led a rally in the first half of the week, before gains were pared by sell-offs on Thursday and Friday. By midday on Friday, the S&P investment bank index was up by 2 per cent for the week although it was down 1.7 per cent for the day. Goldman Sachs was down 0.8 per cent for the week at $178.56 after reports that it and other big Wall Street banks were being examined by the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine their vulnerability to home-loan defaults.Other banks were hit by the news, but still appeared likely to end the week up. Bear Stearns was 1.2 per cent higher for the week at $109.65 by mid-afternoon on Friday, Lehman Brothers was up 5.8 per cent to $59.01 and Merril Lynch was up 6.1 per cent at $74.33.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in the spotlight as investors hoped that the government-sponsored enterprises would soon start buying mortgages to support that market. Fannie Mae said on Friday it had requested permission to increase its investments in home loans and mortgage bonds by as much as $72bn to help provide liquidity in the credit markets.In spite of President George W. Bush’s view that the mortgage lenders should reform their business models before being able to lift their investment portfolio limits, Fannie Mae was 18 per cent higher for the week at $66.82 while Freddie Mac was up 11.2 per cent at $61.92.Shares in Countrywide Financial, the largest US mortgage lender, fell by as much as 14 per cent early on Friday after the company warned adverse market conditions for mortgage lenders may continue to hurt its future earnings. Its shares were up 8.5 per cent for the week at $27.09.The debt and secondary mortgage markets are experiencing “unprecedented disruptions” which could impact the company’s performance, especially in the short term, the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.Despite declining interest rates on standard mortgages, loans have become more expensive and less available for many borrowers, particularly those with poor credit.The S&P Homebuilders index was up 9.5 per cent for the week as hopes of at least one rate cut by the Federal Reserve were significantly raised. American International Group‘s stock rose by 4.6 per cent over the week to $64.47. The insurer reported a 3 per cent rise in second-quarter profit on Thursday, exceeding analysts’ expectations, although it also warned that losses in its mortgage guarantee business were spreading from subprime to prime borrowers.Home Depot was down 1.4 per cent on the week to $35.69 after an announcement on Thursday that it might have to sell its supply unit for less than the previously announced $10.3bn.Wynn Resorts Resorts boosted other casino stocks after it reported a quarterly profit of $89.6m earlier in the week. It rose 10 per cent to $111.24 over the week.Cisco shares ended the week 5.7 per cent higher, at $31.14, after the technology bellwether reported higher earnings than expected on Tuesday on the back of better quarterly sales.Sprint Nextel, the telecoms company, reported lower quarterly profits on Wednesday, but beat analysts’ average forecasts as it added new subscribers. Its shares were down 5.6 per cent at $18.65.Wall Street stocks dived initially on Friday after the moves by central banks. Central banks in the US, Europe and Asia pumped liquidity into the banking system, adding to concerns about a possible global liquidity crunch.“The effects of rising volatility and increasing risk aversion clearly appear to be spreading to the equity markets,” said analysts at Merrill Lynch. “Some equity hedge funds and quantitative long/short equity funds are now liquidating positions at decidedly unfavorable terms.”In a statement on Friday morning, the Federal Reserve said it was “providing liquidity to facilitate the orderly functioning of financial markets” and offered to provide reserves “as necessary” to promote a federal funds rate close to its target rate of 5.25 per cent.The markets looked on course to complete a fourth consecutive week of losses as the bearish tone over credit intensified. That would constitute the worst run in US equity markets since a string of six consecutive weekly declines in June and July of 2004.Leading the charge among financials were Fannie Mae, up 3 per cent at $64.43, and Freddie Mac, 2.8 per cent higher at $61.64. Talk that the government-sponsored enterprises might be allowed to expand their mortgage balance sheets continued to boost their stock prices.

But one dollar a year is precisely the amount of basic pay that Bob Nardelli, the new chief executive of Chrysler, has signed up for.There is a catch. While the terms of his contract remain confidential – he will be employed by the private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management, to do the job – we can rest assured that the new boss will be more than adequately rewarded should the struggling car giant improve its performance.Not that money can be all that important to Mr Nardelli anyway these days. At the start of the year he walked away from his last job, as CEO of Home Depot, the home-improvement chain, with a compensation package worth $210m (€153.7m, £104.1m).In accepting the $1 annual pay cheque, he is emulating Lee Iacocca, the legendary Chrysler boss, who also opted for the one buck package in 1978 as part of his efforts to persuade unions to accept the aggressive cutbacks the firm then needed to survive.In the US there is a small but distinguished band of executives happy to find themselves squarely in the bottom quartile for top people’s pay. Apple’s Steve Jobs, DreamWorks’ Jeffrey Katzenberg, Yahoo’s Terry Semel and the plucky triumvirate of Sergey Brin, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt at Google are all members of the one dollar a year club. As is blogger extraordinaire John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, who touchingly explained last year that he turns up every day “simply for the joy of the work itself and to better answer the call to service that I feel so clearly in my own heart”.You may have noticed what these gentlemen have in common. They are all extremely rich already. For them, one more dollar is neither here nor there. Not only this, but a rich array of perks, pension contributions and stock options more than make up for any disappointment that might otherwise be experienced when the monthly pay slip gets ripped open. And if that basic pay does seem a bit modest, well, it is terribly tax efficient.At this rarefied level, money does not motivate people. Enough money is good and a bit more is even better. But what these dollar boys prove is that reputation and a sense of achievement are what counts at the top in business. Those CEOs who struggle all their lives to get into the upper quartile for pay betray an insecurity that does them little credit.But taking no or virtually no official salary is a pretty hollow gesture too. People should get paid the rate for the job, whatever that rate happens to be.Bob Nardelli is unlikely to allow any of the scepticism surrounding his appointment to distract him from getting on with the job. In any case, he already has 210 million reasons to look on the bright side.The writer has asked that his fee for this article (approximately $1) should on no account be paid to a charity of any kind
341;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Wall St plummets amid subprime fears;;Wall Street stocks plummeted in late trading on Thursday, closing sharply lower after another tumultuous trading session dominated by continuing concerns about the US mortgage market.The volatile session started lower in response to BNP Paribas’s earlier decision to suspend withdrawals from three funds with exposure to US credit markets. That decision had sent European stocks lower.By the end of trading, the S&P 500 was down 3 per cent, closing at a daily low of 1,453.09. The Nasdaq Composite also closed at a low for the daily, falling 2.2 per cent to 2,556.49.The Dow Jones Industrial Average – which at one point was down 300 points – closed marginally above its low for the day, 2.8 per cent down at 13,270.68.All 10 leading sectors in the S&P were lower, led by a 3.7 per cent slump in financial stocks.Wall Street banks were particularly hard hit, with the S&P investment bank index off 5.3 per cent.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index – known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” – surged 24 per cent to 26.59. It had earlier hit 26.90, its highest level since April 2003.Among leading benchmarks, the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies held up the best, down 1.4 per cent at the close.BNP Paribas reported the problems at three of its funds, worth a combined $2bn. The announcement raised fears of contagion and the possibility of a global credit crunch.“The credit crisis is back on,” said TJ Marta, fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Several mutual fund managers have stopped redemptions from funds. NIBC, a Dutch bank, added to the gloom by reporting subprime-related losses of €137m and warned of further losses in the future.The European Central Bank added liquidity to the money market, as did the Federal Reserve.In the US, interest rate futures rose sharply and now price in a quarter percentage point easing in the Fed funds rate by September – up from odds of about 25 per cent on Wednesday.The latest credit woes sparked weaker US credit valuations and the yield on the two-year Treasury note had plunged 15 basis points to 4.59 per cent as investors sought a haven.Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said: “Problems of appropriately marking to market are likely to be systemic at least in the credit derivatives arena. And therein lies the problem. If [Federal Reserve chairman] Ben Bernanke was right in alluding to subprime losses at $50bn-$100bn, then only a small percentage appears to have surfaced so far and since he made those remarks, losses have likely extended across a much broader credit universe than subprime.”In earnings news, American International Group reported a 34 per cent rise in second-quarter profit. That exceeded expectations but the insurer warned that losses in its mortgage guaranty business were spreading from subprime to prime borrowers. AIG stock fell back 3.3 per cent to $64.30 following a gain of 1.4 per cent to $66.48 on Wednesday.Retail stocks were also in the spotlight as Home Depot announced that a deal to sell its wholesale business was being renegotiated and monthly sales figures for July were released.Shares in Home Depot fell the most in a year after it also said it might have to sell its supply unit for less than $10.3bn, the figure it had previously announced.The US’s largest home-improvement chain also announced it was lowering the price range for a stock buy-back to $37-$42 a share, from $39-$44. The company’s share price dropped 5.3 per cent to $35.79.Across the retailing sector, sales were up 2.9 per cent, in line with expectations at Thomson Financial, but below the 3.7 per cent rise in the same month last year.Wal-Mart’s same-store sales for the month ending August 3 rose 1.9 per cent, beating estimates of 1.5 per cent. Its shares were down 2.7 per cent at $47.10.Nordstrom, the high-end retailer, came in well ahead of expectations. The stock lost 1 per cent to close at $50.58.JC Penney also exceeded forecasts, reporting growth of 10.8 per cent, but its shares fell 6.3 per cent to $65.30.Shares in News Corpwere down 1.6 per cent at $22.44. The media group reported that fourth-quarter profit rose 4.5 per cent late on Wednesday.
342;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Credit fears force Home Depot rethink;;Home Depot is set to lower the $10.3bn sale price for its construction supply business after credit market turmoil forced its private equity bidders to ask the second largest US retailer to renegotiate the terms of the deal.The move by Bain Capital, Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice marks the first time since the start of the latest private equity boom three years ago that US buy-out firms have sought to revise the terms of a deal.Home Depot said on Thursday that it had entered talks with the private equity groups that “could result, among other things, in material changes to the terms and financing of the transaction, including a reduction in the $10.3bn purchase price”.People close to the matter said that the marked deterioration in credit markets since the deal was first announced in June made it impossible for the buy-out consortium to finance the leveraged buyout at the original terms.The problems faced by Home Depot, which also reduced the price range of a $10bn share buy-back because of “market conditions”, will trigger investor fears that other buy-outs might have to be renegotiated.However, people close to the situation said the sale of Home Depot’s wholesale unit - which was built through acquisitions by the former chief executive Bob Nardelli before he was ousted in January - was still on track.“There is a willing seller and there are willing buyers,” said one person close to the deal, noting that the three private equity groups would have to pay a $310m penalty if they walk away. However, under the terms of the deal, either party can scrap the deal without penalty if it is not completed by December.Home Depot has been under pressure from Relational Investor, Ralph Whitworth’s activist fund, to shed its construction supply unit and focus on its core do-it-yourself market at time when the US housing market is under severe strain.The company, the second largest retailer in the US, moved to quash rumours that the renegotiation of the deal had been triggered by senior departures at the wholesale unit. “No senior personnel has left,” it said.Home Depot also reduced the price range for a tender offer for up to 250m of its shares to $37 and $42 per share from an $39-$44 range and extended its deadline by two weeks to August 31. The company, whose shares have fallen 11 per cent since announcing the buy-back last month, said offers by investors who have tendered shares at between $39 and $42 would be honoured. Any offer above $42 would have to be retendered.The share buy-back, part of a plan to take on additional debt and return $22.5bn to investors over the next few years, is expected to go ahead even if the sale of the wholesale unit is delayed because Home Depot has secured a $10bn bridge loan from Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.
343;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
344;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-07T19:03:10Z;Observer: Robert Fiske on the case at Bear;;The hedge fund mess at Bear Stearns has already claimed the scalp of Warren Spector, the bridge-playing former bond trader who many thought would succeed Jimmy Cayne as the chief executive.Spector’s abrupt dismissal has not done much for the sagging morale at Bear. It has fallen to Alan Schwartz, who was named president of the firm at the weekend, to try to inspire the troops with rousing speeches.Schwartz’s words – “these are the types of markets in which Bear Stearns excels” – had Cayne and fellow executives at the firm applauding.But word that the firm’s audit committee has launched an internal inquiry into the collapse of the funds has got to give the place just a tinge of paranoia. No matter who you are, it is never fun to have prying eyes reviewing your e-mail, papers and notes.The man leading the inquiry is Robert Fiske, a Wall Street lawyer and federal former prosecutor with a long track record. Janet Reno, the attorney-general under President Bill Clinton, once called him “ruggedly independent”.Reno uttered those words in 1994, when she was appointing Fiske as her special counsel to investigate the Whitewater land deal. Fiske was ultimately replaced by Kenneth Starr, who set the machinery of impeachment into motion against Clinton. Surely this inquiry will be less sordid and tangled.Still, it might be a good idea for Schwartz to have another inspiring speech at the ready.Test resultsThere must be some correlation between doing poorly at history in school and landing the top job in government later in life.In 2001, US President George W. Bush – a history major at Yale – famously told students at his alma mater: “To those of you who received honours, awards and distinctions, I say well done. To the C students, I say: You, too, can be president of the United States.”Now Donald Tsang, Hong Kong’s chief executive, has revealed in a video posted on his blog that he had once failed his history exam. Mr Tsang was speaking on Tuesday to several students ahead of Wednesday’s release of Hong Kong’s public examination results. The exams, taken before grade 12, are similar to England’s GCSE exams.Mr Tsang said he was so interested in the subject, world history, that when he saw that the first question was on the French Revolution he got into an “answering frenzy” and just kept writing. By the end of the exam, he had only answered two of the five required questions, and naturally, failed.“It’s best if you get good marks, but even if you are not successful, just remember that even someone who had failed in the exam could become the chief executive,” said Tsang.Time’s lossTime Warner shareholders have been suffering another bout of cloudy weather recently. Disappointing results from the world’s largest media company last week – with AOL and Time Warner Cable doing worse than expected – has led Time Warner’s shares to continue a downward path.For shareholders based in Texas who happen to have been observing goings on in an underpass near the Trinity River, there may yet be a silver lining. Or a copper lining, to be more precise.The company is offering a reward of $10,000 for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of people involved in suspected copper thefts in the Lone Star State, which happened on lines running through the I-35 underpass. (Unlike Time Warner shares of late, the price of copper has been booming.)The thefts, in June and July, led to the loss of phone, internet and television connections for 61,000 users, leading to thousands of dollars worth of damage. Time Warner shareholders know how painful that can be.Nardelli reduxIt seems the resurrection of Bob Nardelli’s reputation has begun already. The ink is still wet on Nardelli’s contract to run Chrysler, but people are coming out of the woodwork to praise his skills.Jack Welch, Nardelli’s old boss at General Electric, called him an “absolutely perfect fit” with Chrysler.“They’ve got to get cost, efficiency, service, all those things in line. He’s the best in the world at that.” (Welch endorsed Jeff Immelt to succeed him at GE, sending Nardelli to find a job running Home Depot.)Nardelli made headlines for his whopping $210m severance package as Home Depot’s chief executive. His legacy at the home-improvement retail group is mixed.On the one hand, he doubled revenue and profits.On the other, he was accused of being imperious despite presiding over a not-so-impressive performance of the company’s share price. Nardelli drew widespread scorn after he basically silenced his restive shareholders at the company’s AGM.But Cerberus Capital Management, the group that took control of Chrysler from DaimlerChrysler, has been working overtime to let the world see a different side of Nardelli.Though Nardelli wouldn’t say how much he’s getting to run Chrysler, we have learned that he’s a dollar-a-year man – just like Steve Jobs at Apple, or the rich guys who work for Mike Bloomberg at New York’s City Hall.The challenge at Chrysler is a big one. It will be interesting to see if Nardelli earns his salary.observer@ft.com
345;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-06T21:21:21Z;Chrysler’s new man;;Cerberus Capital Management’s decision to hire Bob Nardelli to run Chrysler, while risky, is not completely out of left-field. There are three main counts against Mr Nardelli. His name is synonymous with excessive pay. He has a reputation for abrasiveness with staff and shareholders. Finally, he readily admits he has no auto industry experience.The first two are less of an issue now that Chrysler is in private hands. Mr Nardelli has made the right noises about his pay being performance-linked. Certainly, given his most golden of parachutes from Home Depot, Mr Nardelli is unlikely to be doing this purely to pay the bills. And he is now under no obligation to submit himself to the limelight on a regular basis.His lack of direct industry experience is more troubling. That said, his successful tenure running manufacturing businesses within General Electric is probably of more relevance to Cerberus. In his first press conference as chief executive, Mr Nardelli positioned himself as an execution man, relying on the existing management team and, especially, Tom LaSorda, the man he displaces and who will now report to him as president.That last point is important with regards to current negotiations with the auto unions about reducing legacy costs in the US. Mr LaSorda’s retention as chief executive when the Chrysler deal was announced helped to soothe fears about private equity’s role. Keeping him happy will be critical to how successful Mr Nardelli’s tenure proves to be.Yet there is plainly a need for fundamental restructuring across the entire industry. So Cerberus is taking a calculated risk. Mr LaSorda provides some sense of continuity at a time when industry morale is rock-bottom. But Mr Nardelli’s appointment shows that Chrysler’s new owner is serious about shaking things up.
346;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-06T20:44:26Z;Nardelli’s turn at wheel has look of bumpy ride;;Four years ago, when Bob Nardelli was still heading Home Depot, he introduced a novel reward for store managers who met sales targets: large pick-up trucks.At the time, Mr Nardelli shunned Chrysler’s models and opted to dole out Chevrolet Silverados – one of the best-selling brands of its Detroit rival General Motors.With hindsight, that indifference to Chrysler’s products has done Mr Nardelli’s career no harm.On Monday, the 59-year-old former General Electric high-flyer was officially installed as chief executive of the troubled carmaker by its new private equity owner, Cerberus Capital Management.The surprise appointment of Mr Nardelli – whose knowledge of the motor industry appears limited to his passion for Nascar racing – represents both a remarkable personal comeback and a graphic illustration of the problems Chrysler is facing.On the personal front, Mr Nardelli’s penance in the corporate limbo has been shorter than most.He left Home Depot in January after a bruising battle with shareholders who had attacked his large compensation, his inability to communicate with Wall Street at a time of share price under-performance, and some strategic moves.Mr Nardelli’s fate at Home Depot was sealed in May last year, when his decision to deny investors the annual shareholder meeting turned him, in the words of one pension fund manager, into a “pariah of the shareholder activist community”.Mr Nardelli’s $210m severance package stoked further controversy and led some experts to write him off for good as chief executive material.But Mr Nardelli’s enviable CV – he led three of GE’s major businesses before missing out on the top job by a whisker – and the improvements he drove at Home Depot, where sales and earnings doubled under his watch, were unlikely to keep him on the golf course for long.The main question now is whether Mr Nardelli will stick to the brusque, imperial style of management learnt from his mentor Jack Welch or try to strike a more conciliatory tone with Chrysler’s employees and unions.The latter have already sounded alarm at Mr Nardelli’s appointment.“I’m obviously concerned. [Mr Nardelli’s] track record at Home Depot wouldn’t be one that would give us a lot of confidence,” said Buzz Hargrove, president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, Chrysler’s second largest union after the UAW.Mr Hargrove said that Stephen Feinberg, Cerberus’s chief executive, had led him to believe that Chrysler’s new owners had full confidence in Tom LaSorda, Chrysler’s former chief who will stay on as vice-chairman and president.The prospect of Mr LaSorda remaining at the helm helped sway union leaders to support the deal with Cerberus.On Monday, Mr Nardelli said that Mr LaSorda, who comes from a union family, would spearhead the current contract talks with the UAW.Mr Nardelli will have to lead the turnround of Chrysler’s loss-making operations and continue to reduce its reliance on gas-guzzling sports-utility vehicles and pick-up trucks to stem the decline in US market share.Those who know with him say he will take a hard-nosed attitude to costs and, if the situation does not improve quickly, he will not shirk from adding to the 13,000 job cuts already announced.Further streamlining of operations and plants – a tenet of GE’s corporate philosophy – could also be on the cards.Mr Nardelli will also have to patch up the relationship with Chrysler’s 3,700 dealers, who were angered last year when the company pushed them to take on unwanted inventory in the face of slipping consumer demand. That will be a test of Mr Nardelli’s diplomatic abilities, which were clearly found wanting last time round.Yet, from Cerberus’s standpoint, Mr Nardelli’s turbulent past may be an asset. Unlike other executives, his future is now inextricably tied to the company’s fortunes.Success would probably give him another shot at the helm of a listed company. Failure, however, would almost certainly consign him to the ranks of gifted, but ultimately flawed, business leaders.Additional reporting by Andrew Ward in Washington
347;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Touch of Snow falls on carmaker;;As John Snow sipped his morning coffee in a sun-filled suite at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel last Friday, the chairman of Cerberus Capital Management gave barely a hint of the changes in store at Chrysler.“The new environment being created gives it a better prospect,” the former US treasury secretary said in a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times. “There is tremendous talent there. We have a number of experienced executives who can be seconded to the business and bring fresh eyes.”On Monday, Cerberus revealed those “fresh eyes” belonged to Bob Nardelli, the controversial, former Home Depot chief executive who was ousted from the US retailer in January.Mr Nardelli, 59, had been in talks with Cerberus about its Chrysler plans for the past several weeks and was named chairman and chief executive of the Detroit carmaker during the weekend.Appointing Mr Nardelli could help Cerberus counter criticism that the private equity group’s strategy for Chrysler was not particularly different from the status quo. Until Monday, Cerberus was betting solely on Chrysler’s existing management, led by Tom La­Sorda, and a five-year turnround plan that was prepared by DaimlerChrysler, the carmaker’s previous German owner.Mr Snow, 68, predicted that a radical improvement would come relatively quickly. “I think you’ll see that Chrysler will be in much better shape within three years. This is a plan to get it back to profitability,” he said, while praising Mr LaSorda, who will remain as vice-chairman and president.Cerberus took control of Chrysler last week, after a rough ride through the credit markets forced DaimlerChrysler and Cerberus to take on $2bn of the debt package for the deal. The investment banks underwriting the rest of the loans were left nursing significant losses.“Nobody welcomed the change in the credit markets,” said Mr Snow. “But everybody behaved in a thoroughly responsible way, making reasonable accommodations of the sort you would expect.”Across Wall Street, fears are growing that many of the large leveraged buy-outs of the past few months may not be completed quite so amicably.Private equity groups are trying to force through deals that would leave investment banks holding massive loans on their books. Investment banks are threatening to cut off funding for future deals, potentially dealing a devastating blow to the buy-out industry, which has been enjoying one of its highest peaks.“The banks will be dealing with us for years to come and want to have relationships with us,” says Mr Snow, suggesting that the stand-off could be resolved with some cool-headed diplomacy. “We want to have them as partners.”Nevertheless, Mr Snow is among a growing cadre of buy-out executives who believe that the “golden age” of private equity, as it was described by Henry Kravis of KKR in a speech in April, is effectively over.“For creative private equity people, this is the time for the old saying, ‘You don’t test the captain until you’re sailing in rough seas’, ” says Mr Snow.Naturally, Mr Snow claims that Cerberus, which is run by Steve Feinberg, a reclusive former Princeton tennis champion, is perfectly positioned to make good during more difficult times.“Cerberus deals don’t depend on financial engineering,” he says, echoing the argument many of his top rivals are seeking to push as the environment changes. “Deals that depend on a 50 basis point spread shouldn’t be done. We concentrate on deals with operational upside. We are not going to be radically affected.”Although Cerberus will leave the day-to-day running of Chrysler to Mr Nardelli, the private equity group has already been drawing on Mr Snow on political and labour issues. In July, Mr Snow gave a speech at the National Press Club in Washington arguing against a tightening of fuel economy standards for the motor industry.Mr Snow could also take a more active role when Chrysler enters into a crucial round of talks later this year with the United Auto Workers’ union, which unexpectedly backed the Cerberus takeover in May.“I think I am the only Republican Treasury secretary who ever had open endorsements of organised labour,” says Mr Snow, who spent more than a decade as chairman and chief executive of CSX, the railway group.Now that he is one of the private equity industry’s most senior statesmen, Mr Snow has strong views on proposals in Congress that would involve raising taxes on “carried interest”, or the profits that buy-out groups earn on deals.While carried interest is currently taxed at the capital gains rate of 15 per cent, several senior lawmakers in both parties have said they would back taxing it at the ordinary income rate of 35 per cent. Mr Snow suggests that such a move could undermine investment in the US.“I think that as the discussion goes on, the committees will understand,” he says.“If they don’t, they will upset something fundamental in the way the American economy is organised. So I think that what is going to come out from the talks will be something sensible and reasonable.”

Mr Nardelli said he had met Ron Gettelfinger, the UAW president, for two hours and “had a great exchange with one another”.Chrysler said it would stick to its recovery plan, including the pursuit of overseas carmaking partnerships and alliances. “We’re going to have laser focus on the execution of this strategy,” Mr Nardelli said at ceremonies to unveil the “new” Chrysler, now controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, the US private equity group.Daimler, the German carmaker that had owned Chrysler since 1998, retains a 20 per cent stake.Tom LaSorda, Chrysler’s former chief executive and now president and vice-chairman, singled out Russia, Latin America and India as probable areas for joint ventures. The carmaker has been eager to lower its dependence on the slow-growing North American market. Overseas markets make up only about 15 per cent of total sales.Chrysler also marked the change in ownership by bringing back its five-sided “pentastar” logo and launching a fresh marketing campaign.In an interview with the Financial Times, John Snow , the former US Treasury secretary who chairs Cerberus, predicted a swift improvement. “I think you’ll see that Chrysler will be in much better shape within three years. This is a plan to get it back to profitability,” he said.

350;HD;Home Depot;2007-08-06T11:32:07Z;Chrysler hires Nardelli as boss;;Chrysler, the US carmaker, on Monday confirmed it had hired Bob Nardelli, who was controversially ousted from Home Depot, the second-largest US retailer, in January as its next chairman and chief executive.The selection of Mr Nardelli reflected his acumen as an operational manager, people close to Chrysler said.Tom LaSorda, current chief executive of Chrysler, will remain at the carmaker as vice-chairman and president.The surprise move to hire Mr Nardelli follows last week’s change of ownership at Chrysler, which was sold by DaimlerChrysler, the German carmaker, to Cerberus Capital Management, the US private equity firm, in a $7.4bn deal.Wolfgang Bernhard, the former Chrysler chief operating officer who was brought in by Cerberus this year to help it execute the acquisition, decided not to accept a post as executive vice-chairman at Chrysler, people close to the matter said. They added that Eric Ridenour, current chief operating officer, would leave the company.Mr Nardelli more than doubled sales during his six years as chief executive of Home Depot. He joined the retailer after narrowly missing out on the top job at General Electric, but was criticised for his imperial management style and poor relationship with shareholders.His $210m severance package also became emblematic of the outsized compensation commanded by corporate America’s top managers and contributed to an investor backlash that forced many companies to agree on non-binding shareholder votes on executive pay. At Chrysler, his compensation will be directly linked to the equity performance of the carmaker, people close to the matter said.Mr Nardelli’s decision to return at the helm of a private equity-owned group confirms many experts’ prediction he would find it difficult to stage a comeback among listed companies.However, even his critics acknowledged that, despite his abrasive character, his operational skills, forged in the managerial hotbed of GE’s industrial businesses, would be highly sought after by private equity groups. The main issue for Chrysler would come if Cerberus decides to exit its investment through an initial public offering in a few years’ time, as institutional investors may raise questions over Mr Nardelli’s suitability to lead a listed company.He is the latest former GE executive to join private equity. Jack Welch, who picked Jeffrey Immelt instead of Mr Nardelli as his successor as GE’s chairman and chief executive in 2000, is a senior adviser at Clayton Dubilier & Rice, while David Calhoun, a former GE’s vice-chairman, was poached by the private equity groups that bought media group VNU, now Nielsen, last year.
351;HD;Home Depot;2007-07-27T02:10:23Z;‘Sheriff of Wall Street’ on the ropes;;Eliot Spitzer ran for New York governor last year promising to clean up the state’s notoriously dysfunctional capital in the same bare-knuckled way that he took on Wall Street banks as a crusading state attorney-general.Riding on his reputation as “the Sheriff of Wall Street”, Mr Spitzer cruised to victory, winning almost 70 per cent of the vote – an overwhelming sign of how eager New Yorkers were for reform in their state government.Now, just seven months after taking office, it is Mr Spitzer’s house that is under ethical scrutiny.This week, he was forced to discipline two of his staff members after a scathing government report detailed how they carried out a political hit job on one of the governor’s rivals.Mr Spitzer, a Democrat, has denied knowledge of the plot to discredit Joe Bruno, the top Republican in New York state politics, and has publicly apologised for the matter.But New York Republicans and some editorial writers are asking “what Mr Spitzer knew and when he knew it” – a phrase borrowed from the Watergate hearings. Mr Bruno, a 78-year-old former boxer, seems eager to fight and has called for a fresh inquiry.Suddenly, Mr Spitzer’s ability to deliver the ethical reforms he promised on inauguration day is in doubt. He promised in his campaign to deliver “change from day one” in Albany, the state’s capital. He vowed to cut taxes, curb wasteful spending and tackle a corrupt political culture.Implicit in these goals was a plan to shake up the balance of power in Albany – in particular, the clout wielded by Mr Bruno, who controls the Senate, and Sheldon Silver, the Democrat who controls the assembly.Mr Spitzer seemed to thrive on confrontation with lawmakers, employing tough talk and hardball tactics even against members of his own political party. He allegedly described himself to one lawmaker as a steamroller who would roll over anyone who got in his way.Mr Bruno, in particular, was unimpressed, telling New York magazine this month that Mr Spitzer “has an attitude about him …like he’s above it all. He thinks I’m a street kid that doesn’t know night from day. I’ve survived 31 years. I don’t pretend to be a genius. I have common sense.”Mr Spitzer has failed to master the art of politics, relying instead on the tactics that made him successful as a prosecutor, says Fred Siegel, a history professor at the Cooper Union in New York.“He was not prepared to govern,” Mr Siegel says. “When he was attorney-general he had extensive subpoena powers that allowed him to embarrass private companies with reputations to protect. That gave him tremendous leverage.”Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for the governor, countered that Mr Spitzer had worked with the legislature to “move forward an ambitious agenda”, reforming workers’ compensation and campaign finance laws. “The governor is going to continue to work in partnership with the legislature to move the state’s agenda forward.”The damaging revelations came in a report by Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who succeeded Mr Spitzer as state attorney-general.Mr Cuomo’s inquiry found that the governor’s spokesman, Darren Dopp, and another administration official inappropriately put pressure on state police to create records of Mr Bruno’s use of helicopters and police escorts.Those records became the basis of news articles raising questions about whether Mr Bruno had attended political fundraisers at taxpayers’ expense. Mr Cuomo said Mr Bruno’s use of the helicopters was legal, but recommended that the policy be changed.Mr Cuomo’s report was seized upon by targets of Mr Spitzer’s investigations on Wall Street – some of whom accused him of prosecuting his cases through the media instead of the courtroom – as evidence that they had been treated unfairly by the then attorney-general.“He has manipulated the press and the law to disparage many other decent people for years,” said Ken Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot who came under fire from Mr Spitzer while he was a director of the New York Stock Exchange.Mr Dopp has been one of Mr Spitzer’s closest advisers and played a behind-the-scenes role in his investigations of Wall Street firms during his time as attorney-general.Mr Spitzer suspended Mr Dopp for at least 30 days without pay, while William Howard, deputy secretary for homeland security, has been transferred. Neither of Mr Spitzer’s staff members was found to have broken the law.Mr Spitzer’s administration says it will fight any effort by Mr Bruno to begin a new inquiry. Yet the episode already appears to be threatening Mr Spitzer’s legislative agenda, with a hard-won measure to strengthen campaign finance regulation possibly at risk.“It’s hard to see how he’s going to recover,” Mr Siegel says. “The irony is that you have a political culture that badly needs reform.”
352;HD;Home Depot;2007-07-25T20:44:15Z;Global Overview: Chrysler news rattles equity markets;;"Global stock markets were rattled by fears that leveraged buy-out deals could dry up in the face of increasing investor aversion to risk.Equities were unsettled after banks dealing with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’ buy-out of Alliance Boots failed to sell £5bn of senior loans to fund the deal. Chrysler said it was suspending its $12bn auto loan deal and sweetening pricing terms on a further $6bn of loans.US stocks started out in fine form, jumping more than 100 points in the opening minutes after some upbeat earnings from Boeing and ConocoPhillips.Those early gains evaporated after news of the troubled takeover refinancings broke but stocks managed to rally back before the market closed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent, the S&P 500 was also up 0.5 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.3 per cent.European equities were hit by poor results from Siemens, the German conglomerate, and Volvo, the Swedish truckmaker. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended 0.9 per cent lower.On currency markets, risk aversion drove the dollar higher as weak US home sales data added to concerns about the housing market.Existing home sales for June fell unexpectedly sharply to 5.75m, the lowest for almost five years, adding to fears of a severe and prolonged housing slowdown. Earnings disappointments and profit warnings from corporate America have provided anecdotal evidence of the burgeoning downturn during the past few weeks. Warnings this month from DR Horton, the housebuilder, and Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, were joined on Tuesday by weak earnings from Countrywide, the mortgage lender, and USG, the building materials group. “The slowdown in the US housing market is turning uglier by the month,” said Dimitry Fleming at ING Financial Markets. “From the peak in February 2007, sales have now dropped 14 per cent.” The dollar rallied against the euro and the pound as investors cut their exposure to risk and yen-based carry trades, where the low-yielding Japanese currency is sold to fund higher-yielding purchases.Analysts said currency speculators, in unwinding some of their carry-trade positions, had sold the euro and sterling against the yen, which forced the dollar higher against both
currencies.The euro fell 0.6 per cent against the yen and 0.8 per cent against the dollar, while sterling fell 0.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively.“A move that started with a weak dollar had the effect of helping the US currency against the euro in a classic tail wagging the dog move,” said Alan Ruskin at RBS Greenwhich Capital.The dollar climbed 0.2 per cent against the yen.Gold, which hit an 11-week high on Tuesday, fell 1.7 per cent as the dollar’s recovery prompted profit taking.Ashraf Laidi at CMC Markets suggested European central banks had stepped up their gold sales to meet annual quotas set up under the Central Bank Gold Agreement.“The four-year agreement states that central banks can sell up to 500 tonnes of gold per year,” Mr Laidi said.He added: “Only two-thirds of the quota is estimated to have been sold this year, allowing central banks seven weeks to meet their quota.”Other metals were weaker as caution on commodities markets heightened after the US data.Copper fell on fears that a slowdown in the US housing market would damp demand for the metal, used in plumbing and wiring.U.S. crude prices jumped 3.2 per cent to close at $75.88 a barrel after a big fall in weekly inventories.Credit markets were further shaken as the latest monthly performance data on subprime mortgage securities, which show delinquency rates, where borrowers fail to make payments as required, were rapidly increasing.Benchmark ABX indices, which are created every six months to track the credit risk of loans made in the previous six-month period, hit record lows on Wednesday following the data.Government bonds prices were a touch firmer. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was a little lower at 4.90 per cent, after earlier falling below 4.9 per cent, a seven-week low, while the yield on the 10-year Bund had fallen to 4.40 per cent."
353;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:27+0000;Mania for measuring will send you off target;;Imagine if this column operated like a public company. Would I feel the need to offer editorial guidance, just as companies give guidance on future earnings, in advance of each article? It’s not clear to me what I could usefully tell you – except that, encouragingly, the finishing line will be only about 850 words away.But if I did provide readers with this guidance, I would then face the next horrible challenge: meeting expectations. Would I be punished in the market if I failed to do so?Earnings guidance is such a flawed, misleading and counter-productive activity that I wonder why corporate leaders are still prepared to spend any time on it. Why bother offering up these guesstimates that only help short-term traders make more money, and that expose your share price to greater volatility?Nervous executives who fear even more punishment at the hands of investors should they stop giving out this guidance can take heart from two recent reports, both produced by a body of distinguished authors.In the middle of last month the American Aspen Institute published “Long-term value creation: guiding principles for corporations and investors”, followed two weeks later by the (also US-based) Committee for Economic Development’s “Built to last: focusing corporations on long-term performance”.Both reports criticised the practice of offering earnings guidance and urged corporate leaders to conduct more grown-up, substantial conversations with their shareholders about the long-term aims of their businesses.But it’s not just the short-termism ethos of the guidance process that is troubling. Managers who place so much faith in dodgy forecasts are fundamentally misunderstanding how organisations really work, and how they can be made to work better.Let’s track back a bit from those quarterly earnings guidance figures. What are they based on? Essentially, the best guesses of divisional leaders, who are trying to anticipate future demand and future performance. And how do managers try to ensure that these forecasts are hit? Performance targets are set, based on either an optimistic assessment of the recent past, or hopeful expectations about the future.Either way, uncertainty and inaccuracy are piled upon each other, leading to guaranteed error. Companies either surprise or disappoint the markets, and just occasionally meet the arbitrary expectations they have created. Not for nothing has management by forecast been compared with driving a car by looking only in the rear-view mirror.But surely measurement is everything in business? “What gets measured gets managed,” runs the old saw. Yes – and what gets measured gets manipulated.Targets distort people’s behaviour, and rarely, in the long term, for the good. Look at former chief executive Bob Nardelli’s introduction of Six Sigma disciplines at Home Depot, the DIY chain, in the US. “Facts are friendly,” he declared, and urged vigorous target-setting for all sorts of activities.But staff eventually complained that so much time was being given over to measurement that there was little left to devote to customers. Home Depot hit all its efficiency targets but became the least popular major retailer in the country. Mr Nardelli quit the company in January.One of the most forthright and persuasive critics of the targets culture is John Seddon, managing director of UK-based consultancy Vanguard. He argues that there is no reliable way of setting targets. And targets drive waste into the system. What does “doing 10 per cent better next year” mean if your current way of doing things is hopelessly wrong? You have to change the system, not burden the existing (and faulty) one with more targets. Instead of learning how to do your job differently, and better, people simply adapt their current behaviour to meet their new target.While some big goals – such as, in the UK, cutting waiting lists to see senior doctors – have helped focus minds, they have dealt with only part of the problem. And fixing part of a struggling system places more strain everywhere else.Mr Seddon says managers should only use measures that are derived from the work that needs to be done. These measures will be meaningful, and will focus attention on activity that actually creates value.While the UK government, under the former premier Tony Blair, seemed obsessed by targets – such as waiting times in a hospital’s accident and emergency department (but with little regard to “patient outcomes”), or pass rates of exams (no matter how easy they were to pass) – under the new prime minister, Gordon Brown, things seem to be changing.Last week cabinet minister Andy Burnham announced that of the 110 key performance targets introduced by the government in the past 10 years, only about 30 will survive.Perhaps the wisdom of HL Mencken, the American journalist, has finally been heeded. Targets are a simple solution for complicated problems. And, as Mencken said: “For every complicated problem there is an answer that is clear, simple – and wrong.”
354;HD;Home Depot;2007-07-13T20:50:55Z;Global overview: Gloom turns to euphoria;;A dramatic week in financial markets saw the mood among investors swing from gloom to euphoria as a resurgence of worries about subprime lending and a credit market sell-off was countered by a huge bid in the metals and mining sector.Equities endured a rollercoaster ride, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average following up a sharp slide on Tuesday with its biggest one-day rise for more than two years on Thursday.Credit market concerns came to the fore on Tuesday after ratings agencies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s moved to downgrade a swathe of bonds backed by subprime home loans.The news hit credit markets badly, driving the cost of insuring junk debt in Europe to its highest level for more than a year. Sentiment was further hit by earnings warnings from big US corporate names such as Sears and Home Depot.However, later in the week, stocks rallied strongly on news of a $38bn cash takeover bid for Alcan, the Canadian aluminium group, by Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto and credit market fears subsided.Late in New York on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2.2 per cent over the week, and set a record high. The S&P 500 index rose 1.4 per cent and made a new all-time peak during the day.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.5 per cent over the week, but off a fresh 6½-year high. Several Asian markets set all-time highs, including Seoul and Sydney and Hong Kong.Analysts said investors would remain wary of further bad news on subprime lending, although stocks looked set to maintain their positive tone.Ethan Harris, economist at Lehman Brothers, said: “Subprime aftershocks will continue to test investor nerves in the months ahead.“Some increased caution in capital markets is both expected and healthy, and we think the market will learn to live with the negative news flow. However, there is some ongoing risk of a major contagion event.”The underlying trend in equities should find support from recent evidence of stronger than expected global economic growth and a lack of bad news on the inflation front, according to Andrew Cates at UBS.“Positive global growth shocks and negative global inflation shocks are good news for risk assets and provide some fundamental support to the recent run-up in equity prices despite this week’s credit market jitters.”Disappointing US retail sales data on Friday had relatively little impact on stocks, but helped push the euro to a fresh all-time high against the dollar above $1.38. Sales suffered their biggest decline for nearly two years in June.However, the US currency recovered some of its poise following a strong reading for the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for July.James Knightley at ING said the data were a surprise given the negative newsflow from the housing market, and suggested households perceived the labour market to be in fairly good shape.“Sentiment may also have been boosted by the 3 per cent decline in gasoline prices seen in the month while equity market strength is also likely to have been supportive.”Elsewhere on the currency markets, the dollar set fresh 26-year lows against sterling and also weakened against the yen. But the yen also came under pressure amid fading expectations that the Bank of Japan would raise interest rates next month.Government bonds traded in tight ranges as the spotlight switched to the credit and equity markets.Late in New York on Friday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 5.10 per cent, down 9 basis points on the week. The 10-year Bund yield fell 8 bp to 4.61 per cent.In commodities, Brent crude hit an 11-month high above $77 a barrel, within $1.50 of its all-time high.Gold climbed to a five-week high, helped by the weaker tone of the dollar, while copper briefly broke above $8,000 a tonne but proved unable to hold above that level.
355;HD;Home Depot;2007-07-13T20:45:26Z;S&P 500 closes at record high;;Wall Street shrugged aside a tremor in the credit market this week as leading benchmarks broke free from more than a month of consolidation and entered record territory.After sharp losses on Tuesday, stocks soared on Thursday and rose further on Friday. For the second straight day, both the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record highs.The S&P’s energy, materials and industrials sectors led gains. In contrast, consumer discretionary, and telecoms groups slipped this week.Amid sharp swings in trading, equity volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, was 2.6 per cent higher over the week.For now, equity investors believe the problems in the subprime mortgage market will not hurt the wider economy. In spite of weaker-than forecast national retail sales for June on Friday, much better-than-expected same-store sales at major retailers on Thursday lifted some of the gloom that has pervaded the sector.“Fear and greed are what drives the market over the short term, but earnings and dividends ultimately matter,” said Anthony Conroy, managing director at BNYConvergEx.He added that the market was still trading near the low end of its historic earnings multiple and earnings were the catalyst that could take equities higher.On Friday, the S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,552.50 and also set a new intra-day record high of 1,555.10, a gain of 1.4 per cent this week.After early weakness, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to close at 2,707 on Friday, and gained 1.5 per cent this week.Tech titans, Google and Apple both set new all-time highs on Friday. Google closed up 1.3 per cent at $552.16, after setting a peak of $552.67, while Apple rose 2.7 per cent to $137.73, after making a new high of $137.85.Setting the pace this week was the Dow with a gain of 2.2 per cent. The Dow closed 0.3 per cent higher on Friday at 13,907.25, after setting an intra-day record high of 13,932.29.Mr Conroy said now that the market had broken its recent shackles, investors who were not positioned for that move face having to buy back stocks, that could push the market higher.With the pace of the second-quarter earnings season set to pick up sharply next week, two blue chips, Alcoa and General Electric, have delivered results in line with estimates.Along with Exxon Mobil, boosted by higher oil prices at 11-month highs, these three Dow stocks set record and 52-week highs on Friday. Exxon rose 4.5 per cent to $90.33 this week and set an all-time high of $90.80, as the company’s market capitalisation exceeded $500bn.Alcoa gained 13.7 per cent to $47.35 this week and set a high of $47.69 on Friday. Alcoa withdrew its bid for Alcan late on Thursday and announced the resumption of a stock buy-back program that had been halted when the bid for Alcan was made on May 7. Analysts also believe that BHP Billiton may soon launch a bid for Alcoa now that Rio Tinto has made an agreed $44bn bid for Alcan. Alcan rallied 12.7 per cent to $97.50 this week and has more than doubled in value this year.In earnings, General Electric reported that second-quarter net income rose 9.6 per cent to $5.42bn on Friday, in line with analysts’ estimates. The conglomerate said it would exit its US mortgage business and increase its share repurchase programme this year to $14bn. GE closed 1.3 per cent higher at $39.50, and had earlier set a 52-week high of $40.17.In other deal news, Gerdau Ameristeel said it was buying Chaparral Steel for $4.22bn. Chaparral rose 10.6 per cent to $83.73.Huntsman, the chemicals maker, agreed to be bought for $6.5bn by Apollo Management’s Hexion Specialty Chemicals. That trumped a $5.6bn bid by Basell. Huntsman fell 5.4 per cent to $26.49.On Friday, Energizer agreed to buy Playtex, the maker of feminine care and infant products, for about $1.2bn. Energizer rose 7.5 per cent to $107.67, while Playtex surged 20.8 per cent to $17.97 this week.In contrast, GE and Abbott Laboratories announced that they were unable to agree on “final terms and conditions” of GE’s proposed $8.13bn deal to buy Abbott’s primary in-vitro and point-of-care diagnostics units. Abbott fell 1 per cent to $53.24.There was also uncertainty over the planned $25bn buy-out of Sallie Mae. Shares in the student lender plunged nearly 10 per cent on Wednesday, when some of the Wall Street firms involved in the deal said they might back out due to proposed legislation regulating student loans. Sallie was down 7.4 per cent for the week at $53.64.Profit warnings from retailers such as Home Depot and Sears, down 9.6 per cent to $157.40, sparked worries that the US consumer was starting to slow.Among the better performing retailers, Wal-Mart reported sales growth of 2.4 per cent, against an expected 0.8 per cent, and its stock rose 1.6 per cent to $49.15. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals surged 52.9 per cent to $23.24 this week, after the biotechnology company licensed some of its therapeutic research to Roche, the Swiss drug maker.NYSE Group rose 9.9 per cent to $83.22 after Lehman upgraded the exchange from “market weight” to “overweight”.
356;HD;Home Depot;2007-07-12T18:15:12Z;US retail’s bright spots;;Mortgage meltdowns, flooded Midwest malls, rising petrol prices, again – it’s easy to feel pessimistic about US retailers. But investors ought not to write the sector off altogether.There are obvious risks. Following a surge in late 2006 – as falling energy prices eased pressure on consumers – the sector has had a choppy but ultimately poor run so far this year. Now fears for consumers’ financial health are taking hold again following weak first quarter economic growth data and amid fears of subprime contagion. This week’s gloomy forecasts from Sears Holdings and Home Depot deepened the growing despair. But all is not lost. June’s sales growth data for the biggest retailers, released on Thursday, turned out a shade better than expected, particularly for a sluggish month perched between Memorial Day and the back-to-school shopathon.Seasonal factors aside, though, the central issue remains the health of the US consumer. Here, the potential effect of the unfolding subprime saga is a big unknown holding back investors. Yet, as Citigroup points out, net real estate value accounts for less than a quarter of American households’ net worth. Moreover, there is no such thing as an average US consumer, with the top fifth of US earners doing 40 per cent of the shopping (the bottom fifth accounts for 8 per cent of consumer spending).If the headwind from the property market is perhaps less devastating than commonly held, the tailwind from employment remains strong. Hiring has held up, in spite of the downturn in construction. Salaries are rising at about 6 per cent on an annualised basis, according to Barclays Capital. There is an outside chance that such data will push the Federal Reserve to crimp shoppers’ spending power further with higher interest rates. But current conditions mean disposable income should continue to find its way into retailers’ tills in the second half.
357;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;US mortgage problem fears spark sell-off;;Fears of further problems in the US mortgage industry and the broader economy flared on Tuesday, triggering a sell-off in credit markets as investors sought safe havens.Markets were rattled when Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, threatened to downgrade the credit ratings on some $12bn of bonds backed by US subprime home loans. This raised concerns of a broader repricing of risk in credit markets, leading to heavy losses for some investors, particularly in derivative markets.Rival rating group Moody’s caused further disquiet after the markets closed when it said it had cut or was reviewing ratings for $5.7bn of mortgage-backed bonds. It downgraded 451 bonds and put another 82 on review.The dollar tumbled to a record low against the euro, hitting $1.37, and also fell against the yen and sterling after speculation that a slump in the housing market would slow the US economy. The pound traded at $2.02.US and European stocks sold off dramatically. The S&P 500 closed down 1.4 per cent at 1,510.12.Sentiment was hit further by profits warnings from bellwether stocks including DR Horton, the biggest home builder, Home Depot, the largest home improvement chain, and retailer Sears.The warnings marked a downbeat start to the US second quarter earnings season, raising concerns that the housing market slowdown was hitting company profits. A further jump in oil prices compounded these worries as Brent crude reached $76.63 a barrel to hit an 11-month high.In reaction, the corporate bond market sold off. At the same time, a closely watched derivative index tracking the riskiest subprime mortgage bonds issued in 2006 hit record lows. Subprime mortgages are issued to people with poor credit histories.S&P said it had placed 612 classes of subprime mortgage bonds on watch for possible downgrades. At $12bn in all, the bonds represent 2.13 per cent of the $565.3bn in US residential mortgage bonds rated by S&P between the fourth quarter of 2005 and fourth quarter of 2006.“The level of loss continues to exceed historical precedent and our initial expectations,” said Susan Barnes, credit analyst at S&P. “At this time, we do not see the poor performance abating.”Ciaran O’Hagan, strategist at Société Générale, said: “We felt over the past few days that the market was gunning for a bout of risk aversion and was just lacking the excuse. Downgrades are a good enough one and the threat will clearly linger for a few months, if not longer.”S&P also said it would review ratings for collateralised debt obligations, complex debt securities that package the subprime mortgage bonds under review.Last month, two hedge funds managed by Bear Stearns ran into trouble with their investments in CDOs backed by subprime mortgages.Additional reporting by Paul J Davies and Joanna Chung in London
358;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Wall St slumps amid subprime downgrades;;US stocks fell sharply on Tuesday, hurt by retail and housing sector earnings warnings. Financials were roiled by more bad news from the subprime mortgage market.Selling gathered pace at midday, as a speech on inflation by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, did not address current policy and failed to arrest investor gloom.The S&P 500 index fell 1.4 per cent to close at 1,510.12. It was the worst one-day slide in the index in more than a month. Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index surged 15.9 per cent. All major S&P sectors closed lower, led by telecoms and financials.Worries over banks’ potential exposure to the mortgage market and a possible credit crunch flared when S&P announced it would place $12bn in rated subprime securities under review for downgrade. That sparked safe-haven buying in government bonds and maintained pressure on the stock market.“It makes sense that financials are bearing the brunt of the S&P ratings review story,” said Doug Peta, strategist at J&W Seligman. “It’s hard to see any resolution soon and that makes it hard to love the financials. They have been lagging [behind] the market all year and will continue to do so.”The S&P financials sector is now lower by 3.1 per cent this year and is the only major group in negative territory for 2007. Among investment banks, Lehman fell 5 per cent to $71.10 and Bear Stearns was down 4.1 per cent at $137.96.The retail sector was also in focus and a bearish tone in trading was set by Sears’ second-quarter guidance that was below estimates, due to lower sales of appliances. Sears said it planned to buy back up to an additional $1bn of its stock, but at the department store chain fell 10 per cent to $154.21.Other retailers fell, led by Macy’s, off 3.7 per cent at $40.12, Wal-Mart, down 1.9 per cent at $47.58, and Costco, lower by 1.4 per cent at $60.51.Home Depot, the home improvement chain, cut its earnings outlook for the fiscal year due to a weak housing market. Its shares rose 0.1 per cent to $40.25, as the company sought to buyback 250lm shares.The bearish news on housing was underscored when DR Horton, the largest US homebuilder, said orders for new homes fell 40 per cent during its fiscal third quarter. Shares in the homebuilder fell 2 per cent to $19.40 as the company said it now expected to post a loss in its third quarter. The stock set a 52-week low of $19.16 and other home builder stocks set fresh 52-week lows on Tuesday.Technology and blue chips were not spared from worries over the upcoming earnings season. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2 per cent to 2,639.16 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.1 per cent lower at 13,501.70.Earnings expectations for S&P 500 constituents revolve around a rise of 4.4 per cent seen for the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Financial. Earnings estimates have edged up from 3.9 per cent since the start of April.“Such low expectations should be favourable for the market, since management has beaten estimates for more than three years running,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Among blue chips, Alcoa fell 1.7 per cent to $41.66. The aluminium group reported a 3.9 per cent decline in second quarter profit compared with a year ago. While the result matched estimates, sales were less than expected.Alcoa also extended its $28.6bn bid for Alcan until August 10. Alcoa’s hostile bid, which the Canadian rival has already rejected, was originally set to expire on Tuesday. Alcan fell 0.9 per cent to $86.14 on Tuesday.A bright note for earnings was Pepsi Bottling, which reported a 9.5 per cent rise in the second quarter. The stock rose 3.8 per cent to $35.74.WD-40, the maker of lubricants posted a third quarter rise of 8.5 per cent that was below estimates. It also lowered its outlook for fiscal 2007. The stock slumped 10.1 per cent to $33.25.Greenbrier, a maker of railcars, said its fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 22 per cent amid higher production. The result exceeded estimates and shares surged 15.8 per cent to $33.15.Akamai rose 4 per cent to $49.45, as S&P said the company would enter the broad S&P 500 on Wednesday. The stock will replace Biomet, which has been purchased by private-equity funds.DirecTV rose 1.6 per cent to $24.79. Jason Bazinet, analyst at Citigroup, upgraded DirecTV to a “buy” from a “hold”, amid the strong likelihood that “Liberty tenders for DirecTV within 12 months”. A likely offer price is $30 per share, said Mr Bazinet.
359;HD;Home Depot;2007-07-10T18:59:35Z;Wolseley slumps on US housing news;;Wolseley, the plumbing and building materials group, was under pressure Tuesday following news of further weakness in the US housing market.Wolseley shares closed 2.2 per cent lower at £11.54 after DR Horton, the biggest housebuilder in America, and Home Depot, the US DIY retailer, both lowered earnings guidance.Cazenove pointed out that Wolseley was scheduled to issue a year-end trading update on Monday and that a quarter of group profits came from the US housing market.However, despite the possibility of a disappointing statement and earnings downgrades, Cazenove retained its “in-line” rating on Wolseley because of the possibility of a leveraged buy-out.“Wolseley management has appeared to be in the early stages of thinking on possible private equity ownership, but the recent Home Depot Supply transaction may have accelerated this,” the broker said.In the wider market, leading shares came off the boil as investors decided to bank profits in the wake of the warnings from DR Horton and Home Depot and others from companies such as Sears and Lexmark. Adding to the jitters was news that Standard & Poor’s was reviewing the ratings on $12bn of residential mortgage-backed securities.The FTSE 100 closed 81.8 points, or 1.2 per cent, lower at 6,630.9.Traders said they were not surprised investors had taken profits, pointing to the fact that before Tuesday’s fall, the blue-chip index had risen 3 per cent in eight sessions.Mining stocks, which had been the best performers in that period, took the brunt of Tuesday’s selling, with four of the five biggest blue-chip fallers all from the sector.Lower down the market, the FTSE 250 dropped 127.5 points, or 1.1 per cent, to 11,732.1.Unilever, the Anglo Dutch consumer goods company, managed to buck Tuesday’s weak market trend.Its shares rose 1.9 per cent to £16.47, with traders pinning the rise on the high multiple paid by Danone for Numico, Europe’s largest baby food maker.Traders said the €12.3bn deal made Unilever look cheap, although analysts were quick to point out that there was little overlap between the product ranges of Unilever and Numico.There were also buyers around for Marks and Spencer after the retailer issued a better-than-expected trading update. Its shares gained 1.4 per cent to 641½pDrax, operator of Europe’s biggest coal-fired power station, also managed to finish the day in positive territory, gaining 0.5 per cent to 740½p after Goldman Sachs up-graded to “buy” because of the rising crude price.Drax shares are closely correlated to the oil price. This is because the price of crude determines the price of gas which in turn fuels the power stations that compete with Drax.Insurer Standard Life eased 2.3 per cent to 325p on fears retail investors would soon sell their bonus shares.Among the mid-caps, Arriva advanced 7.9 per cent to 770p after emerging triumphant from the battle to win the UK’s biggest rail franchise, Cross Country.First Choice Holidays, the tour operator set to combine with Tui of Germany, climbed 1.6 per cent to 325¼p after Cazenove drew investors’ attention to the management incentive plans in the merger prospectus.To achieve the maximum payout, group earnings would have to exceed £600m by 2010. Pro-forma profits for the merged entity last year were £322m.Carpetright held firm at £11.20 on rumours that buyout talks with founder and chief executive Lord Harris of Peckham were on track.Enodis, the maker of catering equipment, avoided the worst of Tuesday’s losses. Its shares eased 0.5 per cent to 202¾p as bid rumours continued to swirl.The rumour in the market was that one of last year’s US suitors, Manitowoc, would return with another offer.Possible evidence for that theory came from the fact that there was a pause in Enodis’s share buyback programme on Monday. However, traders cautioned that this could be because Enodis shares were now trading above 200p.
360;HD;Home Depot;2007-07-10T17:49:03Z;Euro reaches record high versus dollar;;The dollar slumped on Tuesday as profit warnings in the US rekindled concerns over consumer confidence, the housing market and subprime mortgage issues.The euro hit a record high of $1.3740 after Home Depot, the US do-it-yourself retailer, cited weakness in the US housing market for cutting its earnings forecasts for the year. Meanwhile, DR Horton, the country’s second-largest homebuilder, added to the housing market gloom, saying sales orders in its third quarter fell 40 per cent.Marc Chandler at Brown Brothers Harriman said: “This is bad news for the housing market, and offsets the recent string of economic data that had shown the US economy finished the second quarter with good momentum.”The Home Depot warning underlined June’s weakening in US consumer confidence. Michael Woolfolk at Bank of New York said: “Confidence is falling as consumers become saddled with high oil prices. The market psychology is to sell dollars.”Further undermining confidence in the US currency was the announcement from Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, that it was reviewing its stance on $12bn of subprime mortgage-backed bonds, with a view to a downgrade.By midday in New York, the euro was up 0.7 per cent against the dollar to $1.3721. The pound hit a fresh 26-year high of $2.0274, before easing slightly to $2.0240, up 0.5 per cent. The yen climbed 1 per cent to Y122.07.Japan’s currency clawed back some recent losses as investors scaled back their risk exposure. The move was most notable against the New Zealand dollar, one of the favoured carry trade crosses due to its much higher yield than the yen. The kiwi lost 1 per cent to Y95.18.Business confidence plummeted to minus 37 in the second quarter, from minus 15 in the first after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised interest rates to 8 per cent last month.“The strength of the New Zealand dollar and recent monetary policy tightening from the RBNZ were clear factors weighing on the business sector,” said Stephen Halmarick at Citi.Australia’s dollar, which has gained nearly 16 per cent against the yen since its year low in March, fell 0.8 per cent to Y105.25.The Bank of Canada’s decision on Tuesday to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.5 per cent came as no surprise after warnings from David Dodge, governor, that inflation was running too high. But waning expectations of a further move in September caused the country’s dollar to fall 0.3 per cent against its US counterpart to C$1.0514.Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics suggested the loonie’s strength would continue while the global boom in commodities supported the resource-rich country’s exports.
361;HD;Home Depot;2007-07-01T17:34:52Z;US groups borrow to pay out to investors;;Some US companies are starting to take on more debt in order to pay it out to shareholders – a response to rampant leveraged buy-outs and activist investors.The moves, while still unusual, could herald a gradual shift among publicly listed companies towards more aggressive capital structures.Recent announcements include home improvement retailer Home Depot’s intention to borrow $12bn to help finance a $22.5bn share buy-back and plans at Expedia, the online travel agent, to spend $3.5bn buying back 42 per cent of its shares – funding part of the buy-back with debt.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said such announcements could be early indications of a change in attitude. “The bottom line is that managements are starting to look at this more aggressively,” he said. “Shareholders, particularly in the large-cap world, are getting more frustrated.”He said even if the jittery credit conditions of recent weeks continued, making debt more expensive, companies could still afford to borrow more. “They’re hurting their returns by being so under-levered.”The latest round of borrowing is aimed at funding returns to shareholders rather than more traditional capital or research investment.Edward Marrinan, head of credit strategy at JPMorgan, said that some recent moves to return cash to shareholders were aimed at staving off activist investors.“Management understandably wants to retain as much control over their own company’s destiny as possible,” he said.Home Depot’s proposed buy-back is one of the largest in US corporate history. Carol Tome, chief financial officer, told Wall Street analysts that increased indebtedness was justified to keep rewarding shareholders in the face of slower growth in profits and sales.She said. “As a maturing company our financing strategy is evolving to one that facilitates capital distribution.”Ms Tome said Home Depot, whose previous chief executive Robert Nardelli stepped down in January amid a controversy over his compensation and treatment of shareholders, would accept a downgrade by credit agencies as a result of its heavier debt load provided that it retained an investment grade rating.In spite of such evidence, some analysts say the limited shift to gear up and reward shareholders with the proceeds will be restricted to specific cases where the threat of noisy activism or private equity attention has forced action.
362;HD;Home Depot;2007-06-22T20:31:51Z;Blackstone fever fails to lift Wall St;;"Wall Street posted sharp losses this week as investors worried about
elevated long-term bond yields, higher oil prices and the exposure of financial stocks to hedge funds.Not even the successful trading debut for Blackstone, the first private equity firm to list on an exchange, could dispel the bearish gloom.Blackstone began trading at $36.45 a share, about 17 per cent higher than its placement price of $31. The stock closed at $35.06.As a tough week ebbed to a close, the S&P 500 index fell 1.3 per cent to finish at 1,502.66 for a decline of 2 per cent since Monday.Investors on Friday were also mindful that the S&P 500 index and other benchmarks faced a shake-up in their composition. The S&P removed three stocks, PMC Sierra, ADC Telecom and Sanmina-SCI - all technology companies. As from next week, they will be replaced by Tyco Electronics and Covidien, two companies spun off by Tyco, while Discover Financial Services, a spin-off from Morgan Stanley, will also join the S&P.The Russell indexes were also rebalanced on Friday, and that sparked some choppy trading ahead of the close said traders.Among the leading S&P sector groups that led losses, utilities was down 4.4 per cent, healthcare was lower by 3 per cent and financials was off 2.9 per cent for the week.Real estate investment trusts and homebuilders also fell sharply this week.The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1 per cent to close at 2,588.96 yesterday for a fall of 1.4 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4 per cent to 13,360.26 for a slide of 2 per cent this week.Interest-rate sensitive stocks were hurt as the yield on the 10-year bond consolidated near recent highs.Of greater concern for the financial sector, however, was a shake-out at two mortgage hedge funds owned by Bear Stearns.Investors wondered if the episode marked the start of further problems as various banks sought to sell collateral and limit their losses to the hedge funds.Analysts at S&P said: “Recent developments underscore the market and credit risks borne by the major broker dealers as a consequence of their hedge fund investments. This is a sector-wide phenomenon that warrants close scrutiny.”Late on Friday, Bear Stearns was 1.4 per cent lower at $143.75, for a loss of 4.2 per cent this week. The American stock exchange’s Broker/Dealer index declined 1.8 per cent on Friday, for a loss of 3.6 per cent this week.The bearish mood in stocks was also a function of concern over earnings and the economy.“The market is currently a little nerve-wrecking for investors,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global market strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank.He said investors were worried that it was becoming harder for the economy to reflect a “goldilocks mix” whereby growth slows to stall inflation but remains strong enough to keep corporate profit humming along.Meanwhile, more professional investors are betting that stocks will suffer the summer blues.For the month of June, the number of short-selling positions on NYSE rose 6 per cent to 12.47bn shares, a record high.One bright spot this week was a rebound in deal activity after a drought early last week.Nuveen Investments agreed to a $5.75bn private equity buy-out and shares in the investment manager jumped 15.1 per cent to $62.83.Genesco rose 6 er cent to $52.57 this week after Finish Line, down 19.8 per cent at $10.13, agreed to acquire the footwear and accessories retailer.Luxottica rose 3.9 per cent at $37.15 as the Italian eyeware maker bought Oakley, a US rival, in a $2.1bn cash deal valued at $29.30 a share. Oakley rose 12.4 per cent to $28.37 this week.Equity Inns jumped 15.4 per cent to $22.71 this week after the hotel and motel real estate investment trust was bought for about $1.26bn by a private real estate trust.Share buy-backs scaled new heights this week.Buoyed by a $10.3bn sale of its supply unit to private equity firms, Home Depot announced a $22.5bn buyback programme. That helped push its stock up 3.7 per cent to $39.36 this week.Expedia, the online travel booking site also announced a $3.5bn buyback, worth 42 per cent of its outstanding common stock. Shares rose 14.5 per cent to $29.06 this week.Semiconductor stocks were in the spotlight this week. Microchip Technology slid 10.1 per cent to $37.80 after the chipmaker cut its sales outlook.Other chipmakers fared better however, with an upgrade for Advanced Micro Devices boosting the stock 6.9 per cent to $14.57.Nvidia traded at an all-time high of $43.35 on a split-adjusted basis as the graphics chip maker revealed a new family of processors. The stock rose 10.3 per cent to $43.62.Earnings and warnings sparked activity in a number of stocks this week.Andersons, an ethanol and grain producer, rose 8.8 per cent to $45.60 after the company increased its full-year profit forecast.Sonic, the restaurant group, lowered its fiscal fourth-quarter outlook due to higher prices for dairy and soybean oil and rising labour costs. Its shares fell 11.6 per cent to $21.48.Best Buy and Circuit City, the electronic retailers, provided disappointing earnings and their shares fell 6.2 per cent to $44.79 and 5.1 per cent to $15.85, respectively.Another stock in the news this week was Kraft Foods. It jumped 6.6 per cent to $36.75 on Thursday on news that Nelson Peltz, the activist investors had purchased a 3 per cent stake in the food company and seeks asset sales. Kraft was up 2.9 per cent for the week at $36.32 at the close of trade on Friday."
363;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Home Depot, Expedia use debt for share buy-backs;;Home Depot and Expedia plan to fund a combined $25bn of stock buy-backs, largely with debt, in recapitalisations designed to give shareholders some of the gains typically seen in leveraged buy-outs.The proposed new debt issues could face a crowded market, with other companies accelerating efforts to borrow as interest rates appear to be moving off their lows, which will make capital more expensive.Home Depot, the home improvement group, plans to sell $12bn of new debt. It is also using $10bn from the sale of its HD Supply unit and some cash to buy back $22.5bn of stock “as soon as practicable”. The news sent its shares sharply higher, but provoked a negative reaction from bond investors.“This combination of events will severely damage the company’s financial flexibility and credit profile,” said Carol Levenson of research firm Gimme Credit.Expedia, the online travel booker, meanwhile, plans to spend $3.5bn buying back 42 per cent of its shares. Gimme Credit estimates it would need to borrow at least $2.5bn, a prospect that sent the cost of credit default swap protection on the company sharply higher on Tuesday.The timing of any debt issues is unclear, but could run into an already busy pipeline.“The new issue calendar, especially buy-out driven, is very significant,” said Jamie Farnham, portfolio manager at Metropolitan West Asset Management.Jim Cusser, portfolio manager at Waddell & Reed, said: “Banks have accelerated their efforts to get issues done. There is not a lot of support in the secondary market for bonds beyond issues being underwritten by Wall Street.”That lack of support could see credit risk premia, or spreads, widen – adding further upward pressure to borrowing costs. “There could be some spread widening as supply bears down,” said Mr Farnham. He said there are currently roadshows for some $15bn in high yield debt. He added investors expect $71bn in bonds and more than $150bn in leveraged loan supply by the end of the year, excluding any funding for Home Depot and Expedia.
364;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;US stocks slide as oil and bonds take toll;;Wall Street slumped on Wednesday, as higher bond yields and lower oil prices weighed on major sectors in the absence of fresh economic news.After a positive start, the S&P 500 index faltered and extended losses to close down 1.4 per cent at 1,512.84. Within the S&P, energy, down 2.9 per cent, utilities, lower by 2.6 per cent and financials, off 1.7 per cent led losses among the major sectors.The Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,599.96.A slide in oil prices hurt energy stocks, while higher bond yields depressed interest rate sensitive stocks such as utilities and real estate investment trusts.Financials were in the spotlight for a variety of reasons on Wednesday. While Morgan Stanley said its second- quarter earnings rose 41 per cent to a record $2.58bn, its stock closed 0.6 per cent lower at $87.32. That was down from a high of $90.33 early on Wednesday as worries over the mortgage market intensified.Bear Stearns slid 2.5 per cent to $143.20 as two of the bank’s hedge funds, that hold mortgage securities, were set to be wound up, as attempts to arrange a bail-out diminished. Merrill Lynch, and other banks that had lent to the hedge funds, were in the process of auctioning collateral on Wednesday.Matthew Albrecht, brokerage analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research said Bear’s “own position in the funds is relatively small, but it may soon provide credit to cover exiting lenders, expanding its exposure”.In deal news, Nuveen Investments agreed to a $5.75bn private equity buyout. Shares in the investment manager jumped 16.6 per cent to $63.14.Meanwhile, shares in Dow Jones rose 3.2 per cent to $60.65 amid talk of another potential buyer for the media company.In spite of the selloff on Wednesday, the leading benchmarks remain sharply higher so far this year and traders believe the market has been due for a period of consolidation.Evidence that retail investors are starting to look at stocks has also increased of late. Charles Biderman, chief executive officer at TrimTabs Investment Research said from last Wednesday through to Monday, US equity funds had attracted an estimated inflow of $6bn and inflows exceeded $1bn on three out of the four trading days.“If retail investors are finally coming back to the US stock market after three years of avoiding it, US stock prices could really start shooting higher,’’ said Mr Biderman.Another source of support for stocks has been companies buying back their own shares. Home Depot rose 4.6 per cent to $40.03 on news that it plans a $22.5bn share repurchase.The home-improvement chain was one of five stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that closed higher on Wednesday. The Dow fell 1.1 per cent to 13,489.34 as 25 of its members declined.As investors approach the halfway mark of the year, sector and style rotation could intensify say analysts.“The market is really trying to figure out where to go from here,’’ said Lincoln Anderson, chief investment officer at LPL Financial Services. “Mega-cap stocks still trade at much lower multiples than smaller and mid-cap stocks.“It would be no surprise to see mega-cap and growth stocks move higher as investors rotate their portfolios,’’ he said.Indications that large companies have attracted buyers has materialised with this week’s 2.5 per cent rise in General Electric.The conglomerate set a fresh five-year high of $39.77 on Wednesday, before it closed down 0.6 per cent at $39.07. GE’s gain of 5 per cent this year lags the 8.2 per cent rise in the Dow.In other earnings news, FedEx reported 2007 fiscal fourth quarter profit rose 7 per cent, but the results missed expectations. However, the company expects a robust full-year outlook and its stock was up 1.6 per cent at $109.80.Meanwhile, Circuit City reported a $54.6m loss in the first-quarter as it cut jobs as part of a restructuring programme. The electronics retailer also withdrew guidance for fiscal 2008 as it continued to restructure and its shares rose 0.2 per cent to $16.10. The stock fell 2.8 per cent on Tuesday.Shares in MGM fell 6.8 per cent to $80.60, rebounding from a low of $77.10, as plans by Kirk Kerkorian – who owns 56 per cent of the company – to privately buy the Bellagio Hotel and Casino and the $7.4bn Project City-Center seemed set to falter.MGM said on Wednesday that it had entered into a letter of intent to form a 50-50 joint venture to develop an integrated resort property on the Las Vegas Strip.
365;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Home Depot plans $22.5bn buy-back;;Home Depot is to buy back almost a third of its shares, in a move that reflects the drive by Frank Blake, its new chief executive, to adopt a more friendly attitude towards its shareholders.The retailer said on Tuesday that a planned $22.5bn buy-back programme, to be partly funded by the $10.3bn sale of its HD Supply unit to private equity, would be “transformational”.The buy-back is one of the largest in US corporate history and comes after the retailer faced rising shareholder complaints under Robert Nardelli, who stepped down as chief executive in January amid a controversy over his compensation.Home Depot said the proceeds from the sale of wholesale supply business – which was built up by Mr Nardelli – would be combined with a $12bn debt issue to fund the $22.5bn buy-back, which would be carried out “as soon as practicable”.It said the repurchase “may be in the form of a tender offer, open market repurchases or accelerated share repurchases”.Carol Tome, chief financial officer, said in a statement that the resulting recapitalisation, which about doubles its existing debt, would be “transformational for our company”. She argued that the new debt levels would be supported by its underlying cash flow.Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s debt rating services immediately said they were reviewing the company’s debt rating for a probable downgrade.Stella Kapur of S&P said the agency expected the retailer’s “future financial policy will continue to be more shareholder-friendly”.Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea said “the potential stress” from the transaction was “significant”, given the ground lost to its rival Lowe’s while it pursued the development of its HD Supply wholesale unit.The retailer confirmed on Tuesday that it is to sell its HD Supply unit to a group led by Bain Capital, Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.Mr Nardelli had made the supply business a central element of his strategy. However, activist investors argued that the business was not delivering the expected returns on investment.
366;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
367;HD;Home Depot;2007-06-19T22:16:43Z;Wall St edges higher as bond yields fall;;Wall Street edged higher on Tuesday, while bond yields fell sharply and investors sifted disappointing earnings news from the retail and semiconductor sectors, a massive stock buy-back at Expedia and a management shuffle at Yahoo.Housing starts data for May declined 2.1 per cent against an expected fall of 3.5 per cent. The report briefly pressure home builder stocks, but the S&P homebuilders index ultimately rose 0.1 per cent, trimming its loss for the year to 21.4 per cent.“Housing starts confirm that homebuilders have become more pessimistic over the last two months,’’ said economists at Lehman Brothers. “Next week’s sales data will tell us if that was warranted.’’The S&P 500 index closed 0.2 per cent firmer at 1,533.70. Stocks had spent much of on Tuesday flirting with a negative close, only to stave off that outcome when yields fell to their lows of the day in late trade. The yield on the 10-year bond fell seven basis points to 5.07 per cent. At this juncture, analysts say yields are not high enough to spark a large move out of equities.“Fixed income does not represent a major value opportunity relative to equities, in our view,” said Vinay Pande, chief investment advisor at Deutsche Bank. But he said the recent rise in bond yields means “that the large tailwind equities had from very attractive funding has now dissipated materially”.Among the 10 main industry groups in the S&P, industrials and telecoms closed higher. Consumer staples and technology stocks led declines.The Nasdaq Composite closed a fraction higher at 2,626.76.Within the technology sector, semiconductor stocks were in the spotlight. Microchip Technology slid 9 per cent to $37.91, after the semiconductor maker cut its sales outlook for the first quarter ending June 30.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 13,635.42. A bright spot for blue chips was General Electric, which hit a five-year high of $39.60 and closed up 3.2 per cent at $39.29.Among stocks in the news on Tuesday was Yahoo, down 1.7 per cent at $27.63 as investors reacted to the news that Jerry Yang, co-founder of the company, had been appointed chief executive. He will replace Terry Semel.“Over the past six months Yahoo has now seen two major restructurings and experienced sizable management turnover. Without a single wholly new principal announced, we don’t necessarily see major changes,” said Scott Kessler, internet software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Shares in Best Buy slumped 5.9 per cent to $45.18 as its first-quarter earnings fell 18 per cent and the retailer lowered guidance for 2008. Shares in other electronic retailers fell on Tuesday. RadioShack lost 3.3 per cent to $33.71, while Circuit City fell 2.8 per cent to $16.07.Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 4.2 per cent to $31.58, after a judge ruled that the patent for its Plavix drug, used in preventing blood clots, was valid. The stock set a 52-week high of $32.07 earlier in the day.In the latest buy-back, Expedia said it would purchase up to 116.7m shares for $3.5bn, worth 42 per cent of its outstanding common stock.Shares in the online travel company jumped 14.3 per cent to $29.14. “Based on this newly announced buy-back programme, which could notably aid 2007 earnings-per-share, we are raising our 12-month target price to $30 from $25,” Mr Kessler said.On Tuesday, India’s Sterlite Industries raised $1.75bn in American depositary shares, that valued the metals concern at $9.25bn. The stock was placed at a price of $13.44 in an initial public offering and will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.Home Depot rose 0.8 per cent to $38.27 after it agreed to sell its supply division to three private equity firms for $10bn. The home improvement chain then announced that the proceeds will help fund a $22.5bn buy-back programme. In after-hours trade, the stock shot up 6.1 per cent to $40.60.Deal speculation surrounding the mining sector continued on Tuesday. Investors await news on whether BHP Billiton will launch a bid for Alcan, the Canadian aluminium producer that is currently the subject of a $28.7bn hostile bid from Alcoa.Shares in Alcan rose 0.9 per cent to $84.31, while Alcoa dipped 0.7 per cent at $41.58.Shares in CBOT Holdings slipped 0.2 per cent to end at $208.90. Investors await whether rival bidders for the exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings and the IntercontinentalExchange will increase their bids for a third time.Last week, the US Department of Justice cleared a merger between CBOT and CME. Shareholders in both exchanges meet on July 9 to vote on approving the merger.

Benign core inflation readings for May reinforced the stabilisation in bonds and also boosted stocks.Tony Crescenzi, bond strategist at Miller Tabak & Co, said the inflation data would “help to restrain any increase in yields, which for the stock market is enough to put worries about the bond market a bit further into the background”.Attention has focused on whether the recent rise in bond yields will damp what has been a frenetic pace of merger and acquisition activity. On Friday, there were signs that deal activity was picking up and Home Depot, up 0.4 per cent at $37.95, received two separate bids for its wholesale supply unit. Among sectors in the vanguard of this week’s rebound was energy, as oil prices hit nine-month highs. Rate-sensitive utility stocks rallied, while higher commodity prices buoyed materials and industrial stocks.However, the rise in yields pushed mortgage rates sharply higher and the home builder and real estate investment trust sectors declined.The leading index this week was the Nasdaq Composite. The technology benchmark rose 1.05 per cent to 2,626.71 on Friday, a rise of 2.1 per cent over the week. Semiconductor stocks rallied 2.8 per cent this week, led by a 11 per cent rise to $24.24 for Intel. The chipmaker was upgraded to a “buy” on Friday by Goldman Sachs.The S&P 500 rose 0.65 per cent to 1,532.91 on Friday, a gain of 1.7 per cent this week.

The blue chip barometer was just shy of its recent record peak of 13,692. The Dow Transportation Average rose 1.1 per cent this week, taking its gain this year to 13.5 per cent as the sector rebounded from a sharp slide on Tuesday, when it hit its lowest level since mid April.Leading the blue chips this week was General Motors, up 11.8 per cent to $34.66 as investors cheered hopes for a union settlement over Delphi, the car maker’s former parts unit, that would help GM’s restructuring efforts.Ford rose 8.2 per cent to $8.92 this week, after it hired banks to advise on the sale of its Jaguar and Land Rover divisions.Deal talk this week focused on the exchange sector. Shares in Nymex rose 1.7 per cent to $142.12 on Friday, for a gain of 13.5 per cent this week, amid reports that it was seeking to merge with another exchange.The tug of war over CBOT Holdings, between the InterContinental Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange took a couple of twists.The CME and CBOT revised the terms of their merger agreement and will provide a special dividend to all CBOT shareholders. This followed a move by ICE on Tuesday to include a cash component in its bid for the CBOT. Shares in CBOT rose 4.3 per cent to $206.98, CME was up 0.6 per cent at $552.70, while ICE gained 7.8 per cent to $156.98.The S&P steel index fell 4.9 per cent, trimming its gain in 2007 to 27.9 per cent as consolidation talk cooled. Nucor slid 5.4 per cent to $63.02 after the steelmaker warned that its second quarter earnings would be well below analysts’ expectations.A number of stocks either hit record or 52-week highs.Eastman Kodak set a 52-week high of $30.20, and rose 10.3 per cent to $29.31. It said it had created image-sensor technology to allow photography in poor light.Freeport-McMoRan rose to a record high of $84.90 amid higher copper prices and news that the miner will sell some assets. Shares in the company gained 10.8 per cent to $84.42 this week.Apple hit a record high of $127.61 before investors cashed in after the company’s annual Developers Conference in San Francisco passed with no major new product news. The stock fell 3.2 per cent to $120.50.In earnings news, subprime mortgage woes clipped fixed income results at Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs. For the week, Bear was up 1.5 per cent at $150.09, and had pared its 2007 loss to 7.8 per cent.

369;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;S&P 500 narrowly misses new closing high;;The S&P 500 index failed to set a new closing high on Monday, after the benchmark briefly transcended a record level for the first time since the bursting of the dotcom bubble more than seven years ago.The S&P closed 0.15 per cent firmer at 1,525.10, after it reached a high of 1,529.87 earlier in the day. That peak was above its record close of 1,527.46 set in March 2000 but shy of the intraday high set the same day. Within the S&P, energy and technology were the leading industry groups.Deals and earnings results were in focus as the week began, with investors searching for a catalyst that could extend the past seven weeks of gains for blue chips and put the S&P in record territory.Merger and acquisition activity was led by AllTel, whose shares rose 6.7 per cent to $69.60. TPG Capital and GS Capital Partners, a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, made a $27.5bn, or $71.50 a share, bid for the wireless telecoms company.Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards, said the market had been trading quietly, but the latest deal news kept investors mindful that merger activity was unlikely to slow down any time soon.AG Edwards has a year-end target of 1,550 for the S&P, but Mr Wren said: “We could get a surge that takes us above that level in the next few months.”A record pace of buy-outs and hefty stock buy-backs from companies have instilled a bullish backdrop for stocks, analysts said.Monday’s extension of the rally in stocks came as oil prices and Treasury bond yields remained near their recent peaks. Traders said asset allocation out of bonds into stocks had gathered pace last week.Mr Wren said rising Treasury yields were not hurting equity sentiment as “anything below 5 per cent is still reasonable”.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent higher at 2,578.79, with earlier gains pared by a slide in semiconductor stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 13,542.88, after blue chips set a new all-time high of 13,586.03 earlier in the day.Shares in Altria rose 1.3 per cent to $70.85, and the stock was one of the leading blue chips in the Dow.Citigroup believes the tobacco company will soon spin off Philip Morris International, a move that could propel the stock higher. “We continue to reiterate our strong ‘buy’ rating on Altria Group and our conservative $82 price target ahead of the PMI spin-off,” it said.That bullish tone was highlighted by current activity for options on the stock. TradingMarkets Options said put options for Altria that expire in June – contracts that profit should the stock price fall – “are the most under-priced puts of all stocks in our database”.Financial stocks were highlighted by analysts at Bespoke Investment Group. They noted that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan had registered gains of more than 10 per cent “since the subprime-driven declines in late February shook the group slightly”. By contrast, shares in Bear Stearns and Lehman “have basically gone nowhere”.General Electric rose 0.4 per cent to $37.10 after the $11.6bn sale of its plastic business to Saudi Basic Industries.Hologic fell 6.3 per cent to $54, after the medical equipment maker said it would buy Cytyc for $6.2bn, boosting the diagnostic device company by 22.7 per cent to $43.Yahoo slipped 1.3 per cent to $29.35, amid talk that the internet search engine may buy Bebo, a UK social networking site, for about $1bn.Dow Jones fell 3.5 per cent to $51.10, after a research group said News Corp was likely to give up its $60-a-share bid in the face of resistance from the Bancroft family, which wields voting control. News Corp rose 0.9 per cent to $23.90.In earnings, Lowes, the home improvement chain, said first quarter profit fell 12.1 per cent.

Shares in rival Home Depot fell 0.6 per cent to $38.63.Saks reported an 86 per cent slide in first quarter profits from the year-ago period, which included gains on asset sales. Shares in the upmarket retailer fell 6 per cent to $21.33.
370;HD;Home Depot;2007-05-21T15:59:29Z;Housing slump brings woes for Lowe’s;;Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, sounded a gloomy note on the US housing market as it reported a drop in its first quarter profits and lowered its earnings outlook for the year.Robert Niblock, the company’s chief executive, said Lowe’s assumes “that the housing market is at or near bottom and will not get dramatically worse from here.”This marks a slight shift in the retailer’s view on housing - the health of which helps to dictate consumers’ demand for renovations to their homes - from the end of the last quarter. In February, Mr Niblock told analysts of “indications that our sales trends have bottomed”.Lowe’s said its earnings in the first quarter fell by 12.1 per cent to $739m, or 48 cents a share, missing analysts’ expectations by 1 cent. Sales in stores open at least a year fell by 6.3 per cent.Over the last year the drops in home prices and construction activity have hit home improvement retailers hard.Last week Home Depot said its earnings fell 30 per cent in the first quarter as housing troubles and high energy prices depressed consumer demand.As a result of the weak results, Lowe’s cut its forecasts for the year.Same store sales are expected to drop by 1-3 per cent in the current quarter and 1-2 per cent for the full year. Lowe’s said in February it expected same store sales to be flat to up 2 per cent.Full year earnings are predicted to be $1.99 to $2.03 a share, less than the $2.02 to $2.09 previously forecast.“They have been consistently optimistic and consistently wrong,” said Colin McGranahan, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein. “Now they have grown a little more cautious.”Worries remain about Lowe’s outlook because while sales had picked up following a period of unusually cold weather in early April, most of the recent improvement was likely to be seasonal. The average amount customers spent at Lowe’s fell in the last quarter, suggesting they are spending less on more expensive items, analysts said.“Consumers are reticent over making large ticket purchases for their homes because they are not sure that big changes will help them sell or add value to their homes,” said Jay Mccanless at FTN Midwest.
371;HD;Home Depot;2007-05-18T20:57:59Z;Bull run continues on Wall Street;;Wall Street’s bull run continued this week, with the exception of the technology sector, as deals and earnings news pushed the S&P 500 index to within sight of its all-time high.Late on Friday, the S&P had risen 0.65 per cent to close at 1,522.75, a gain of 1.1 per cent over the week. The benchmark notched its seventh consecutive weekly rise and closed at its highest level since setting its record close of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Energy and telecoms stocks were the best performing sectors, while information technology was the laggard among the 10 major groups within the S&P.Higher oil prices and a further rise in bond yields were unable to weigh on stocks.“We are seeing so much consolidation and the market has also shifted its focus to the economy,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.“The market can absorb higher oil prices and bond yields if the economy is looking stronger.”Blue chips remained the bull’s prime choice this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 13,500 points for the first time and set a series of record closes as its run of strength since the end of March continued.On Friday, the Dow rose 0.6 per cent to finish at 13,556.53, a rise of 1.7 per cent for the week.A feature of the market’s current rally has been strong buying of large blue chip stocks. This positive sentiment was nurtured this week when high-profile investors such as Warren Buffett, Edward Lampert and Carl Icahn revealed their latest stock selections in regulatory filings.Railroads were a prominent sector, boosted by investment from Mr Buffett and Mr Icahn, and the S&P railroad index rose 3.8 per cent this week. Mr Lampert’s disclosure of a stake in Citigroup helped the bank’s shares rise by 3.6 per cent to $55.By contrast, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite was bedevilled by weakness among many semiconductor stocks amid a general rotation out of tech. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 2.7 per cent this week. On Friday, the Nasdaq rose 0.75 per cent to close at 2,558.45, but slipped 0.15 per cent for the week.The Russell index of small companies fell 0.7 per cent for the week.Leading declines among chip makers was Micron Technology, down 6.9 per cent to $11.47, after the group said it planned to sell $1.1bn in convertible notes.One ray of light among chip makers was Advanced Micro Devices, up 6.2 per cent to $15.59 this week, as it rolled out a new line of graphics cards designed for high-definition video games.In another week replete with deals, Microsoft said it would purchase Aquantive, the digital marketing group for about $6bn on Friday.It is the largest acquisition yet made by Microsoft, and its stock fell 0.5 per cent to $30.83, while Aquantive soared 77.8 per cent to $63.79 on Friday.“We view the acquisition as a necessity for Microsoft to compete against Google in online advertising, an estimated $40bn market growing at a 20 per cent rate through 2010,” said Jim Yin, systems software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Shares in General Electric rose 1.2 per cent to $36.96 on Friday, as the conglomerate moved towards selling its plastics business for $11bn to Saudi Basic Industries.In other acquisition activity this week, Cardinal Health bought Viasys Healthcare for $1.42bn. Viasys rose 38 per cent to $43.53, and Cardinal Health rallied 3.9 per cent to $71.77.Mylan Laboratories, the drugmaker agreed to pay $6.6bn for the generic drug business of Germany’s Merck KGaA.

The stock closed out the week a fraction higher at $38.62.
372;HD;Home Depot;2007-05-15T22:22:21Z;Tech stocks weigh on Wall St;;Shares in Wall Street were mixed on Tuesday, as blue-chips vaulted further into record territory, while losses in technology weighed upon broader benchmarks.News that consumer price inflation moderated last month helped stocks avert a tough start when Wal-Mart and Home Depot disappointed investors with their first-quarter results ahead of the opening bell. The mood turned bullish, however, after the release of benign inflation data for April. Annual core inflation – which excludes food and energy prices – rose less than expected.“Investors are making an interest rate play as the fall in annual core inflation takes us closer to the Fed’s comfort zone and they could be in a position to cut rates later this year,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at Avalon Partners.The moderation in annual core inflation to 2.3 per cent in April from 2.5 per cent during March is seen providing the Federal Reserve with some flexibility should the economy slow further in coming months, economists said.“This report is definitely a positive surprise for us on the inflation front,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.But Treasury bond yields rose, suggesting the data did little to raise traders’ hopes of a near-term rate cut. The rise in yields in spite of continued weakness in the housing market helped clip the early gains seen in stocks said traders.The S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,501.19, still adrift of its record level of 1,527.46 set in March 2000. Materials and telecom stocks were the best performing groups within the index, while the technology sector was in negative territory, weighed down by a 1.1 per cent fall in the Philadelphia semiconductor stock index.The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,525.29.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed in record territory on Tuesday and rose 0.3 per cent to 13,383.84. The blue-chip barometer established an all-time intraday high of 13,481.60 and set its 22nd record close for the year. The Dow managed to absorb disappointing results from two members, Wal-Mart and Home Depot.The world’s largest retailer said its first-quarter earnings rose 8.1 per cent, matching estimates, but investors were disappointed with Wal-Mart’s warning that second-quarter results would come in at or below forecasts. Its shares fell 0.5 per cent to $47.62.Meanwhile, Home Depot reported a 29.5 per cent decline in profit for the first quarter. The home improvement chain blamed variable weather and weakness in the housing market for failing to beat estimates. Its shares lost 1.8 per cent to close at $38.30.Shares in Agilent rose 5.2 per cent to $37.78, after it posted a 7 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings and said its revenue outlook indicated a strong second half to the fiscal year.Ingersoll Rand shares jumped 5.8 per cent to $49.29 after the machinery and heavy equipment maker said it was looking to sell some of its businesses.There was further selling in Amgen after Medicare and Medicaid Services said it may limit coverage of the drugmaker’s anaemia drugs, which a Food and Drug Administration panel recently said should have new labelling. Shares in Amgen were 3.7 per cent lower at $54.01 as it also received multiple brokerage downgrades.Johnson & Johnson, whose anaemia drugs was also in focus at the FDA last week. It fell 1.3 per cent to $61.82. The company was the worst laggard in the Dow.DaimlerChrysler reported that first-quarter profit rose in spite of a wider loss at its Chrysler group, which it agreed on Monday to sell to a private equity firm. Shares in the carmaker closed 0.8 per cent higher at $84.80. Other car makers were higher, with General Motors up 4.4 per cent at $31.97 after it was boosted by a brokerage upgrade. Ford rose 2.3 per cent to $8.91.In deal news, Beckman Coulter, the biomedical instrument maker, said it would not raise its $90-a-share bid for Biosite, the medical diagnostic company that has backed a $92.50-a-share offer from Inverness Medical Innovations .Shares in Biosite fell 3.1 per cent to $91.71. Beckman shares were up 2.3 per cent at $66.08, while Inverness slid 2.7 per cent to $39.89.
373;HD;Home Depot;2007-05-15T20:28:25Z;Consumer gloom envelops top US stores;;Wal-Mart and Home Depot, the two largest US retailers, issued earnings warnings on Tuesday that painted a gloomy picture of US consumers beset by a depressed housing market and rising energy costs.Frank Blake, chief executive of Home Depot, said he expected pressures on the home improvement retailer to continue, with a continuing decline in mortgage equity withdrawals to fund projects, and increasing housing inventory.“We continue to face headwinds in our market, and are not planning for any near-term market improvement,” he said.Mr Blake said unusually bad weather during two weeks in April added to the retailer’s problems in its first quarter.Sales at retail stores open for at least a year fell more than 7 per cent. Overall sales were up just less than 1 per cent at $21.6bn and earnings fell 30 per cent.“While we expected a tough quarter, this was worse than we anticipated,” he said.Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, also highlighted concerns over higher petrol prices. He said the company faced “challenges” in the year ahead.Wal-Mart would respond to the economic pressures facing its mostly low-income customers with aggressive price cutting, said Mr Scott.Operationally, Mr Scott also expressed disappointment with Wal-Mart’s overall performance in its first quarter, which saw sales rise 8.3 per cent to $85.4bn, and earnings rise 8.1 per cent.While the results were in line with Wall Street’s expectations, the company’s key US stores division has yet to show signs of improvement as it continues the second year of a revitalisation push.During the quarter, operating expenses at the stores grew slightly as a percentage of sales, in spite of the introduction of new staff scheduling systems.Inventories grew almost twice as fast as sales, as the retailer continues to face problems with its home furnishings and apparel offerings.Home Depot’s HD Supplies wholesale unit, for which it is seeking a buyer, reported a 45.8 per cent increase in sales to $3.1bn and a 9.4 per cent increase in operating earnings to $163m.Home Depot earned $1.05bn, or 53 cents per diluted share during the quarter.Its shares slipped just less than 1 per cent to $38.72 during morning trading in New York.Wal-Mart earned $2.83bn, or 68 cents per diluted share. Its shares also slipped less than 1 per cent to $47.64.
374;HD;Home Depot;2007-05-14T20:43:28Z;Nasdaq led lower by tech stocks;;US stocks finished mixed on Monday as the market failed to build strongly on early momentum after plenty of deal news – led by the sale of the Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital – and was weighed down by losses in the technology sector.The sale of an 80 per cent stake in the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler to US private equity group Cerberus Capital led the carmaker sector higher.Reports that members of the Ford family were considering selling their stake in troubled Ford were also welcomed by Wall Street. Ford lost a record $12.7bn last year and its shares rose 4.1 per cent to close at $8.71 after Monday’s reports.General Motors, the largest US carmaker, was led higher by the news in its sector. Its shares gained 3.9 per cent to $30.62, making it top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The Standard & Poor’s 500 index was down 0.2 per cent, at 1,503.2, having slipped below 1,500 earlier in the session, and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 0.6 per cent at 2,546.4.The Dow gained 0.2 per cent per cent to finish at 13,347.1. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 0.9 per cent to 822.3.Many investors on Wall Street refrained from making big bets on Monday ahead of Tuesday’s release of the Labour Department’s consumer price index for April. Economists are expecting a smaller increase than March.Investors are also awaiting data due on Tuesday from the National Association of Home Builders that could shed more light on the housing sector.Monday’s caution was also heightened as investors waited for Tuesday’s release of several key company earnings reports, in particular those from Dow components Wal-Mart and Home Depot.In other deal news, US drugmaker Mylan Laboratories agreed to pay $6.6bn for the generic drug business of Germany’s Merck KGaA. Shares in Mylan fell 12 per cent to $19.70.Shares in Teva Pharmaceutical, which was also mentioned as a potential bidder for Merck’s generic unit but was beaten to the punch by Mylan, moved a touch higher at $39.98.Cardinal Health agreed to buy Viasys Healthcare for $1.42bn. Ohio-based Cardinal said it would make a cash tender offer for outstanding shares of Viasys at $42.75 a share, a 35 per cent premium to Friday’s closing share price of $31.55. Viasys rose 36.9 per cent to $43.18, and Cardinal Health was up 0.2 per cent at $69.19.Saudi Arabian Oil Company, or Aramco, and Dow Chemical, the US group, announced a joint venture over the weekend to develop a large-scale petrochemicals complex in Saudi Arabia. Some analysts estimate that the effort could eventually cost $22bn. Dow shares fell 0.6 per cent to $45.52.A US judge late last week ordered Google to face a jury trial in a trademark infringement suit that could hit the search engine’s main source of advertising revenue. Google shares fell 1.1 per cent to $461.80.In corporate news, software giant Microsoft said it had entered an agreement with nine technology companies to create a suite of office communication tools. Microsoft shares fell 0.3 per cent on the Nasdaq Stock Market to close at $30.97.Yahoo shares were down 2.5 per cent to $29.31 after the website was sued on behalf of investors who lost money last summer when the company’s shares suffered the largest drop after sales missed analyst forecasts by a large margin.Dell, down 2.1 per cent to $25.27, and Juniper Networks, down 2 per cent to $23.43, were among heavily traded technology shares that dragged the Nasdaq Composite index lower.Advanced Micro Devices shares rose 4.6 per cent to $15.36 after the company rolled out a new line of graphics cards designed for high-definition video games. The cards are available at different price and performance levels for desktops and laptops.American depositary receipts of Rio Tinto, the third-largest mining company in the world, fell 3.7 per cent to $280.05 after the company failed to confirm or deny reports that it may have hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to help defend against possible unsolicited takeover bids.Shares in Nokia, the telecommunications company, rose 3.6 per cent to $25.96 after it revised up its predicted market share.
375;HD;Home Depot;2007-04-29T23:33:12Z;Relational investors set sights on undervalued;;Ralph Whitworth, the San Diego-based financier, briefly made headlines in 2003 when he paid Paul McCartney $1m to perform a series of Beatles classics at the 50th birthday party of Wendy Whitworth, his wife and a producer of CNN’s Larry King Live. The sum was later donated to an anti-landmines charity.But Mr Whitworth’s growing recognition in the US business world has little to do with philanthropy or his presence among elite social circles in southern California.As of this year, Mr Whitworth can legitimately lay claim to having pulled off the swiftest and most effective activist move on a large US public company in recent memory.Relational Investors, his company, took a small stake in Home Depot in December and proceeded to push for massive changes at the underperforming $80bn retailer.By February, Robert Nardelli, Home Depot’s controversial chief executive, had been ousted, the company had decided to consider a sale of its $11bn supply business, and David Batchelder, one of Mr Whitworth’s main lieutenants, was offered a seat on the board.The move on Home Depot cemented Mr Whitworth’s reputation and his ambition to target large companies now appears unrelenting: Relational has recently been building a position in Sprint Nextel, the struggling US telecoms group with a market capitalisation of $58bn.Raised in a remote corner of Nevada, where his father was a geological engineer, Mr Whitworth built his career in finance after studying law at Georgetown University and moving to Texas, where he worked for Boone Pickens as the veteran oil investor proceeded to mount takeover bids for some of the largest US energy groups.By 1986, Mr Whitworth was back in Washington heading a trade association – United Shareholders Association – that lobbied in favour of “shareholder rights”.When USA folded in the mid-1990s, Mr Whitworth joined forces with Mr Batchelder in securing $200m in funds from Calpers, the California state pension fund, to set up Relational.Relational has delivered an annual return of about 18 per cent since inception. With $6.9bn under management, the firm’s main focus has been to target companies it believes to be undervalued, with a particular emphasis on cases of poor corporate governance.Before launching his campaign against Home Depot, Mr Whitworth spent several years pursuing Sovereign, the Pennsylvania-based bank formerly run by Jay Sidhu.For months, Mr Whitworth’s message was that Sovereign’s board was riddled with conflicts and had agreed to a twin deal to sell a 20 per cent stake to Spanish bank Santander and simultaneously acquire Independence Community Bank for $3.5bn in a move that disenfranchised investors. Eventually, Mr Sidhu was ousted.Mr Whitworth now holds a seat on the Sovereign board.Other Relational investments over the years have included big positions in Mattel, the toymaker, Waste Management, the waste disposal group, and JC Penney, the clothing retailer.Politically, Mr Whitworth is generally described as conservative: in 1984 he worked for US president Ronald Reagan on his re-election campaign.
376;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Wal-Mart sees jump in CFL sales;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, says it the percentage of its customers buying energy saving fluorescent light bulbs has more than doubled over the past year, from 5 to 13 per cent, reflecting the impact of its drive to promote the sale of the bulbs across its 3,000 US stores.The bulbs are one of five “green products” whose adoption levels Wal-Mart says it will start publicly tracking on a quarterly basis as nationwide indicators for the adoption of more environmentally friendly products.Andy Ruben, head of Wal-Mart’s sustainability drive, said the jump in adoption of the low energy compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs) reflected “the kind of change we’re looking for”. More than 130m people shop at the retailer every week.The retailer has set a target of selling 100m energy saving bulbs this year and has doubled the shelf space devoted to the bulbs. Home Depot, the home improvment chain that has the largest sales of CFLs, sold 50m of the bulbs last year.The level of household penetration in the US for CFLs is currently estimated at under 10 per cent, against around 15 per cent in Europe.Wal-Mart has also published current adoption figures for organic milk and babyfood (1.15 per cent and 4.31 per cent), concentrated detergent (23.6 per cent) and extended life paper products (50.77 per cent).It has also launched what it says will be a quarterly survey of customer attitudes towards the environment. Fifty seven per cent of 2,543 people surveyed said they are “extremely concerned” about the environment, and 62 per cent saying they would buy more environmentally friendly products if there was not a price difference with conventional alternatives.Mr Ruben said the survey and the tracking products was a way of tracking the gap between what people say about the environment and how they act when shopping.Separately, Home Depot, the second largest US retailer, has announced what will be the largest US “eco-friendly” labelling project for 2,500 products that have lower environmental impacts than their competitors.
377;HD;Home Depot;2007-04-11T16:34:11Z;Click and drag your way to that ideal sink;;You see a picture of a beautiful bathroom in a home-decorating magazine and think “I just love that sink.” So you go to the magazine’s website, click on the picture, and it immediately displays all the product’s details – manufacturer, price, size, specifications and so on.“Whoa! I didn’t think it would be that expensive,” you mutter. Luckily, many similar products are also displayed next to this particular item, so it is easy to compare features and prices. Another click takes you through to a local vendor where you can make your purchase.For many shoppers, a service that combines the benefits of the specialist magazine’s expert advice with the price information of comparison websites may seem ideal. But it has not yet materialised, thanks to the enormous behind-the-scenes difficulties of delivering it.The biggest hurdle is the need for an up-to-date, comprehensive database of every product on the market, which factors in data-sharing and commercial agreements with the full range of relevant suppliers. Such a service also needs to connect this data to retailers’ and dealers’ inventories, and handle the financial logistics of a leads-referral business. And it needs to make the whole process simple and easy to use for consumers.These are some of the reasons why, even as they embrace the internet, magazine publishers have stayed focused on their traditional strengths of editorial content and display advertising.Now, though, Meredith Corporation, publisher of consumer magazines such as Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle and Home Journal in the US, is crossing the line between editorial content and closing sales by making comparison shopping a central part of its online service.“We keep on getting requests from users saying ‘Where can I get that lamp? Where can I get that sofa?’,” says Dan Hickey, editor-in-chief of bhg.com, the sister website of Better Homes and Gardens. “Now we are connecting the dots between inspiration and transaction.”On bhg.com’s home makeover service, which was launched this month and will be fully up and running later this year, consumers will be able to research products online and tag their findings for future reference. They will have access to online “home remodelling” planning and “envisioning” tools where they can drag and drop pictures of products into three-dimensional mock-ups of their rooms.They will also be able to view large databanks of pictures of bathrooms, kitchens and gardens, clicking on particular items within these pictures to connect seamlessly to the comparison shopping service. To achieve this, bhg.com staff are now mapping the site’s image bank of 15,000 photographs of kitchens, bathrooms and outside spaces to the Edgenet database, which is used by Home Depot, the US home-improvement retailer, and its suppliers among others.Mr Hickey claims he is delivering “a holy grail” to both consumers and manufacturers by combining editorial content with comparison shopping. Consumers gain the ability to move “from inspiration to transaction”, supported by the right sort of information every step of the way. Manufacturers, meanwhile, have an opportunity to connect with consumers at each step of the journey from initial idea to the point where purchasing decisions are made.“With this, we can provide a service to the consumer, and to the manufacturer, and to the retailer in a way that is measurable and monetisable,” says Mr Hickey.The result is a new online business model that both strengthens traditional display advertising while tapping into fast-growing revenue streams elsewhere: search-advertising and sales commissions from referrals.Reinventing the consumer magazine business model in this way will not be easy, however.Many of the more sophisticated services – such as “drag-and-drop” – are still in development. An auction system that allows manufacturers to bid for product placements may undermine consumers’ trust in the brand’s editorial values. The limited number of participating retailers – restricted to industry giants such as Home Depot and Lowe’s – means price comparisons are not yet comprehensive.There is a question mark, too, over how much synergy there will be between print and online. The print version of Better Homes and Gardens has 7.6m readers, but only about one-third of the website’s users are magazine readers or subscribers.The model could also falter if shoppers simply take advantage of the information provided by bhg.com but then shop separately, thereby denying it revenues from retailers for referring the lead.“We are looking at ways to follow that customer into the store and identify that customer to our retailer partners,” Mr Hickey responds. “For example, if they are using the room-envisioning tool, they can print the product list and that way we can track it”.As standalone services, both traditional magazine publishing and comparison sites have their weaknesses. Magazines are strong on ideas, but dangerously dependent on just one revenue stream – display advertising. Comparison sites are creating new revenue streams and can be useful to shoppers, but these shoppers need to know exactly they want and not be looking for advice or reassurance.By merging their strengths, this experiment could prompt two once-separate industries to rethink their futures.
378;HD;Home Depot;2007-04-08T19:25:04Z;US unions to target Verizon in pay campaign;;The AFL-CIO, the largest US trade union federation, is to make Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon Communications’ chief executive, the “poster child” for its campaign against excessive executive pay after previously targeting the chief executives of Pfizer and Home Depot.Richard Trumka, the AFL-CIO’s secretary-treasurer, noted that Mr Seidenberg had earned more than $109m in the past five years, despite negative total shareholder returns during the same period of about 5 per cent.The AFL-CIO’s decision last year to mount what it described as a “successful campaign” against Pfizer and Home Depot helped fuel growing investor concern about performance of chief executives and their severance packages.In the wake of that campaign, Hank McKinnell, Pfizer’s former chief executive, stepped down in July after accumulating a $198m exit package while Home Depot’s Robert Nardelli secured a $210m severance deal when he resigned by mutual agreement with the company in January.“Working people are fed up with a system that showers CEOs with lavish rewards with little or no accountability,” Mr Trumka said at the launch of the AFL-CIO’s 2007 Executive PayWatch website at the end of last week.“We call upon Congress and the SEC to give long-term investors the tools they need to ensure that boards are composed of independent directors who are ready to hold management accountable to the long-term best interests of public corporations.”Under Mr Siedenberg, Verizon has invested heavily in growth areas including Verizon Wireless, its joint venture with Vodafone of the UK, and in the introduction of TV and other advanced data services over a new fibre-based network dubbed ‘Fios’ in an effort to offset declining traditional voice lines.However, heavy investment and concerns about Verizon’s video strategy – designed to compete with cable TV companies – have held back the company’s share price and shareholder returns.“Through a ‘vote no’ on Verizon’s compensation committee and three important shareholder proposals, we will lead the effort to clean up this company’s governance,” Mr Trumka said. Verizon is due to hold its annual shareholder meeting on May 3 in New York.Peter Thonis, a spokeman for Verizon, said: “This is really about the union’s disputes with Verizon on organizing issues and has nothing to do with CEO compensation.“Verizon is among the most transparent companies regarding senior executive pay, and in fact our CEO works without an employment contract or annual pension benefits and he no longer accrues future pension benefits.”The PayWatch site features six case studies, including Home Depot and Pfizer, designed to highlight how corporate executives have benefited from large severance packages and stock options backdating at the expense of companies and their shareholders.
379;HD;Home Depot;2007-04-03T20:33:46Z;Housing sector ends losing streak;;Wall Street stocks marched higher on Tuesday as lower oil prices coupled with evidence that the housing market might be consolidating boosted sentiment.Hopes that Iran and the UK would resolve their dispute through diplomacy put pressure on crude futures. The rally in equities gathered pace when an index for pending sales of existing homes rose more than expected in February. While the index was 8.5 per cent below its level a year ago, the data fuelled hopes among investors that the housing market might have bottomed.The S&P homebuilders index rose 1.3 per cent and broke a run of eight days of losses. “The overall tone of news is helping the market,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards.He said recent inflation data that showed elevated price pressures could still pose a “headwind” for stocks.Financial stocks rebounded from recent losses. The mood was brightened when Accredited Home Lenders surged 17.8 per cent to $10.04. The big subprime mortgage lender said it had secured a $1.1bn line of credit from two banks.The S&P 500 index closed up 0.9 per cent at 1,437.77, with all 10 major industry groups in positive territory. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.1 per cent to 2,450.33 as technology stocks were led higher by Google and Ebay.Google rose 3 per cent to $472.60 as the internet search engine said it would help EchoStar Communications measure the influence of television commercials that are shown on EchoStar’s satellite service. EchoStar gained 1.2 per cent to $44.04.Shares in Ebay rose 2.4 per cent to $33.80 after Bear Stearns raised its first quarter profit and sales estimates for the online auctioneer.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1 per cent to 12,510.30 and was back in positive territory for the year to date. Home Depot led blue chips with a rise of 2.2 per cent to $37.63.Meanwhile, the Dow Utilities Average has risen 11.6 per cent so far this year – but Mr Wren said the sector might have peaked. He expects the utility sector to match or trail his forecast of an overall stock market advance in 2007 of 8-10 per cent.Peter Cardillo, strategist at Avalon Partners, said the performance of utilities reflected a sense among investors that oil prices were close to a top while relatively low interest rates supported valuations.Kroger rose 1.6 per cent to $29 after Citigroup raised its rating on the food retailer to “buy” with a price target of $33 a share.Geron slid 3.8 per cent to $7.15 after the US Patent Office ruled out three patents on human embryonic research held by the company.Taser rose 1.2 per cent to $8.20 and reversed early losses after the maker of stun guns lowered gudiance for first quarter sales.
380;HD;Home Depot;2007-03-28T20:26:48Z;Diller calls executive pay ‘no big deal’;;Barry Diller, chief executive of internet group IAC, has lashed out at corporate governance reforms for undermining the competitiveness of US business and dismissed executive compensation as “no big deal” for shareholders.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Diller, one of the best-known and best-paid media executives, said the greater scrutiny of corporate America had made management overly cautious and was pushing many companies, including his own, to consider going private.“We [Americans] have found ways to take our competitive edge actually mechanically away from us,” Mr Diller said. “You have boards now that are skittish in every area. They’ve made chief executives very skittish.”The former head of Paramount Pictures and founder of News Corp’s Fox television network, Mr Diller has built IAC into a collection of internet businesses, including Ticketmaster and Match.com dating site. Expedia and other travel-related web businesses were spun out in 2005 and are now seperately traded.More recently, he has become both a target and vocal critic of the corporate governance movement, which has risen up in the wake of US business scandals, such as Enron.His comments are a stark departure from the stance on pay and corporate governance taken by many of America’s leading chief executives.Mr Diller said executive compensation was “a very tiny slice” of companies’ overall expenses and blamed journalists for inflaming the issue. “I think it’s close to criminal,” he said of recent press coverage critical of high levels of executive pay.Mr Diller came to the defence of Robert Nardelli, the former Home Depot chief executive, who was lambasted by shareholders after he left the company and got a $210m severance package in spite of its poor performance.“Bob Nardelli is no friend of mine. But Bob Nardelli signed a contract,” Mr Diller said. “They stole him away from other companies to come work for Home Depot at the time when he was a superstar.”Turning to the media industry, Mr Diller said that Google would struggle to come to terms with traditional media companies that have so far resisted doing deals to distribute their copyrighted video content on YouTube, the online video site it acquired last year for $1.65bn. Viacom is suing Google and YouTube for copyright infringement while two other media giants, News Corp and NBC Universal, last week announced plans to start a rival site in a move to control the burgeoning market for online video.“They’re in an impossible situation,” Mr Diller said of Google, which is now trying to license content from those companies.
381;HD;Home Depot;2007-03-23T20:15:58Z;Blackstone warns investors on ‘club’ deals;;Blackstone is warning investors in its $4bn initial public offering that large “club” deals could be “less successful” than smaller transactions because of the US private equity group’s inability to control key decisions related to the companies.“Club” deals, in which private equity firms team up with one another to buy large targets, have emerged as one of the most controversial features of the global boom in leveraged buy-outs.Blackstone published details of its planned IPO on Thursday night.Several public pension funds investing in private equity groups have opposed the proliferation of these deals on the grounds that they concentrate their exposure to certain transactions and do not allow them to differentiate between rival private equity groups. These deals have also attracted the attention of US antitrust regulators worried about potential collusion among buy-out funds.Blackstone’s comments about club deals highlight the high-risk, high-reward nature of private equity dealmaking that stock market investors would be buying into.Blackstone’s planned IPO has raised speculation that other peers that have been considering listings, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Carlyle and Texas Pacific Group, could soon follow suit. Carlyle this week said it had “no plans” for an IPO. KKR and TPG declined to comment.In its IPO filing, Blackstone acknowledged that shared control of companies could be very risky even though it reduces competition for assets.“Consortium transactions generally entail a reduced level of control by Blackstone over the investment because governance rights must be shared with the other private equity investors,” the firm run by Steve Schwarzman said.“Accordingly, we may not be able to control decisions relating to the investment, including decisions relating to the management and operation of the company and the timing and nature of any exit.”Blackstone sealed its largest deal, the $39bn purchase of Equity Office Properties, the commercial real estate group, without any partners. However, Blackstone has often teamed up with rivals in the current dealmaking spree. For example, It is part of a four-member consortium eyeing a takeover of Home Depot’s $11bn supply business.The warning on large club deals came in the “risk factors” section of Blackstone’s IPO filing. This portion of a flotation document is sometimes overlooked because the statements are often overly pessimistic. However, it also forces executives to be especially candid about their business.
382;HD;Home Depot;2007-03-19T17:23:20Z;One click gets you in touch with an expert;;When online customers become confused over Bank of America’s credit card offerings on its US website, Kathy in Phoenix, Arizona, is ready to help.If a potential client abandons an on-screen application, a pop-up invitation offers a chance “to chat now with a credit card specialist,” through “a secure live-chat session”.Up comes Kathy, ready to answer typed questions about APRs, annual fees and the arcane arts of the balance transfer.The application, provided by LivePerson, a listed software applications company, could mark a significant advance in online retailing, by bringing the experience of shopping on the web closer to that of a conventional store with knowledgeable salespeople.“We’ve been able to change the dynamics of online shopping. Finally the web isn’t functioning as an automat, but as a store,” says Robert LoCascio, LivePerson’s founder and chief executive.The service is the latest version of the “click to chat” or “click to talk” concept in which a user in need of assistance clicks on an on-screen button and either begins a text messaging session or invites a direct telephone call from a sales agent.Unlike other such services, LivePerson’s on-screen application appears only in response to specific behaviour online, such as abandoning a credit application, or pulling out of an online purchase halfway through.When it first appeared, the “click to chat” concept supposedly offered retailers the chance to turn more browsers into sellers. But Lauren Freedman of E-tailing Group, an e-commerce consultancy, says it has struggled to win over retailers.“Every year I wait for the tactic to explode, and every year it doesn’t,” she says, noting that 29 out of 100 online retailers surveyed by her firm were using the tactic in 2006, only two more than in the previous year.Part of the reason, she argues, is that customers who want to deal with a knowledgeable expert can find themselves speaking to a poorly trained sales agent or operator. “The person who calls this wants the right answer . . . and someone who moves to ‘live’ help has to be really desperate, so you have to be more [accurate].”Mr LoCascio argues that LivePerson’s rules-based approach allows the retailer to direct trained experts at the most potentially lucrative customers – in effect mimicking the behaviour of a traditional sales assistant.The company has about 200 clients using its rules-based Timpani system, ranging from Neiman Marcus, the luxury retailer, to the home improvement retailer Home Depot, as well as the UK’s Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS banks. Chrysler has also used the system to market its Dodge Nitro SUV.Javad Ra’ed, an online executive at Home Depot, says the retailer initially used the rules-based system to support sales of high-cost home appliances, and then extended it to support seasonal sales of items such as garden furniture, grills and tractors, training its operators in each sector.“These are items that are traditionally regarded as hard to sell online,” he says.He adds that the percentage of customers who make a purchase after using online chat support is about three times higher than the rate for those who are not given the option. Similarly, a live-chat intervention managed to salvage about 30 per cent of sales that customers were abandoning for various reasons after starting the check-out process.An operator, he says, can usually handle two customer interactions at once, and sometimes three. If there are not enough operators available, the system stops issuing more invitations.Mr LoCascio says one reason his business has grown fast – it is now used for about 3.5m chats a month – is that retailers are under greater pressure to improve their online conversion rates. At the same time, internet users are more comfortable with instant messaging chat techniques.“People used to say that chat was for early adopters,” says Mr LoCascio. “That isn’t the case any more.”Ms Freedman at E-tailing Group remains cautious about whether rules-based help will end up delivering a service that goes beyond generic answers. “The question is whether the operator is really just another another generic operator, who really doesn’t know more than any other operator. It’s all in the training.”
383;HD;Home Depot;2007-03-06T22:05:25Z;AT&T forced to allow pay vote;;US regulators have forced AT&T to ask shareholders whether they want a non-binding vote on executive pay in a move that will bolster investors’ efforts to have a greater say on the compensation of America’s corporate leaders.The decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission, contained in a letter seen by the Financial Times, is a major blow to AT&T, which has been one of corporate America’s staunchest opponents of an unprecedented campaign by investors and lawmakers to introduce a UK-style, yearly vote on executives’ pay.The issue will feature prominently in this season of shareholder meetings following investor outrage at the huge severance packages awarded to executives at companies such as Home Depot, the retailer, and Pfizer, the drugmaker.State and union pension funds have filed motions at more than 60 companies demanding a non-binding vote on compensation amid concerns that executive pay has not been adequately linked to companies’ performances. The SEC adjudicates when a company objects to such a motion.AT&T confirmed on Tuesday that the SEC had rejected its request to exclude the motion on executive pay from the “proxy” form containing matters to be voted on at its annual investor meeting on April 27.In its submission to regulators, the telecommunications group had maintained that the proposal by the Ameritech/SBC Retirees group breached SEC rules because it “merely purports to express shareholders’ views” rather than requiring action from the board.The months-long tussle between AT&T and its shareholders has become famous in corporate governance circles because the telecoms group supported its argument by quoting what some considered to be an irrelevant decision regarding a shareholder’s demand to include his poems in a company’s proxy.AT&T said that a yearly vote on compensation conflicted with the legal power of directors and the board to manage the company.However, in its letter – sent to the company last month – the office of the SEC’s chief counsel said it was “unable to concur” with AT&T’s views. It also rejected AT&T’s contention that the proposal breached state law in Delaware, where the company is incorporated.If the proposal is passed, shareholders could be able to vote on the compensation of AT&T’s executives, led by chairman and chief executive Edward E. Whitacre, from as early as next year. In 2005, Mr Whitacre earned $17.3m, a 25 per cent rise on the previous year.
384;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Tax system reform can address unrest over high pay;;"Market economies derive their legitimacy and political support from the belief that the incomes received by those who operate in them reflect their contributions to the economy.Recently, huge incomes have been received by individuals whose contributions have been questionable. The former chief executive of Pfizer, Hank McKinnell, received “severance arran­ge­ments” worth $200m and the former boss of Home Depot, Robert Nardelli, received $210m on leaving that company. Their performances as managers had been anything but brilliant, leading to their replacement. These are not isolated instances of extraordinary compensation for failure.It is becoming more difficult to argue that the compensation of executives and some other highly paid individuals, such as hedge fund managers, is “fair and efficient” and reflects genuine contributions to economic welfare. These individuals belong to that one-in-a thousand group that, according to statistics released by the US Internal Revenue Service, has seen its share of total US personal income rise from 3.3 per cent in 1979 to about 10 per cent now. (The top 1 per cent has seen its share of total income rise from 9.6 per cent in 1979 to about 20 per cent now). In 2004, 240,000 individuals reported incomes of more than $1m. This has contributed to a large increase in income inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, from 0.40 in 1980 to 0.47 in 2005.Significant parts of the compensation received by many of the top income earners are not true “incomes”, as economists would define the concept, but “rents”. Increasingly, they originate from complex, non-transparent and non-competitive arrangements that clever individuals manage to extract from corporate boards and other bodies, or from privileged positions in financial and other markets. Industrial countries may be developing sophisticated versions of “crony capitalism”.Who pays for these incomes? A large part is paid by shareholders, who see the value of their shares stagnate or fall, as happened to Pfizer and to Home Depot. Another important part comes from workers’ wages.Could the market reverse this trend on its own? More shareholder activism would help. However, shareholders’ ownership is often too small to justify the cost of direct involvement. Only pension funds and large shareholders can be expected to play an active role in particular enterprises. As to the direct, active role of workers, globalisation and the demise of union power have reduced that possibility. Workers’ reaction can come mostly through the political process and in ways that could prove damaging to market economies.One ought to be reluctant to bring the government into the picture because this might replace market failure with government failure. But workers and the public will demand governmental intervention and politicians will respond to them.That intervention may take different forms; some more benign than others. It might, for example, require full disclosure of the salary arrangements of executives. The government might become more vigilant against abuses, such as the arbitrary dating of stock options. It might focus on the composition and responsibility of corporate boards. Or it might focus on the tax treatment, at corporate level, of the compensation paid to managers; by, for example, not allowing tax deductions for compensation exceeding specified levels. Public intervention may also come in more damaging ways, such as import restrictions and a push for highly progressive income taxes.A less damaging way to deal with very high incomes might be to reform the tax system by combining features of flat-rate taxes with progressive taxes. Suppose that the tax system were made up of a rate (or a few rates) that were relatively low for most while taxpayers with exceptional incomes were taxed at a steeper rate on the part of their incomes exceeding some high level. Most of the upwardly mobile taxpayers, for whom incentives are clearly important, would experience lower marginal tax rates than they now do, while the relatively few with exceptionally high incomes (for whom the incomes are likely to contain significant elements of rent) would experience a tax rise at the margin; say, over $1m. Given the large and increasing share of total income going to the top income earners, the incentives for most individuals could be improved significantly (by lowering their tax rates) with­ no loss in government revenue. Such a system would strengthen incentives, improve equity and may reduce pressure for more drastic actions.The writer is a former director of the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department"
385;HD;Home Depot;2007-03-01T03:16:21Z;Sharp falls in sales of new US homes;;Americans bought far fewer new homes last month, according to government data released on Wednesday that showed sales fell at the fastest rate in 13 years.Sales of newly built homes fell 17 per cent as the backlog of houses standing empty remained stubbornly high, figures from the Commerce Department showed.The drop was greater than even the most pessimistic Wall Street economists predicted and sent shares in housebuilders tumbling. Home Depot shares also slipped as the DIY store said it expected anaemic sales and lower profits this year.The slowdown prolongs uncertainty over the duration and depth of the construction sector slump and underlines the risk to economic growth from the weak housing market.House prices also eased as the median cost of a new home fell 2.1 per cent from a year ago to $239,800. The pace of sales fell to 937,000 from a rate of 1.1m the previous month, while inventories of unsold homes stood at 537,000. The biggest drop was in the west, where sales fell 37 per cent to an annual rate of 166,000.Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said: “Builders will probably have to continue to work off bloated stocks of finished homes for most of 2007.’’The Federal Reserve views the overhang of unsold homes as cause for concern but remains cautiously optimistic the sector is stabilising and will not derail the economy. The central bank on Wednesday continued to forecast moderate economic expansion this year after fresh figures showed the economy grew at a much slower rate than previously thought last quarter.Drew Matus, an economist at Lehman Brothers, said: “The figures suggest the eco­nomy is playing out largely as the Fed expected, with a little bit of worrisome weakness in the housing market.”The economy grew at a rate of 2.2 per cent in the fourth quarter against an estimate of 3.5 per cent. Government figures released on Wednesday also showed prices cooled as core inflation slowed to 1.9 per cent from an estimate of 2.1 per cent.Peter Kretzmer, an analyst at Bank of America, said Wednesday’s data pointed to growth “well below” trend this quarter.
386;HD;Home Depot;2007-02-28T21:55:33Z;Bernanke remarks lift US stocks;;Reassuring comments from Ben Bernanke soothed investors’ nerves on Wall Street on Wednesday and helped stocks edge upwards following one of the biggest one-day falls since 2001.After a tentative start the market began to rally with some conviction as the Federal Reserve chairman said in testimony to Congress that there had been no material change in his outlook on the economy.Defensive stocks that are less sensitive to a downturn in the economy fared well, while the homebuilding sector continued to decline after weak new home sales data.“Calm heads prevailed,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist, Cantor Fitzgerald. “There was no overwhelming reason to continue the decline and the market took the opportunity to bounce back. Bernanke’s statements had a calming effect.”The S&P 500 index closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,406.82, slightly off its peak earlier in the morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.4 per cent higher at 12,268.63.But, in spite of Wednesday’s gains, the Dow and the S&P closed the month lower for the first time since June and May respectively.In a sign of that nervousness was beginning to ease, the Vix index, a measure of market volatility nicknamed Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 15.5 per cent to 15.47. It jumped more than 60 per cent on Tuesday.Procter & Gamble was one of the best performing stocks with a rise of 3.6 per cent to $63.49. There was little to explain the sharp rise except for investors seeking a safe haven. Shares in the tobacco group Altria rose 2 per cent to $84.28.Sprint Nextel jumped 4.6 per cent to $19.30 after the mobile phone operator reported higher quarterly profits and said it expected the number of its subscribers to rise.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,416.13, buoyed by Apple stock, which gained 0.8 per cent to $84.61 after bullish comments about expected sales of its new mobile phone.The sharpest fall in new home sales in 13 years somewhat tempered the more positive mood, however, and sent shares in homebuilders lower.The S&P Homebuilders index was down 1.2 per cent while shares in Toll Brothers were 2.4 per cent softer at $29.86.Investors in Alcoa remained on the defensive as doubts over Chinese demand raised concerns about the aluminium maker. It fell 1.1 per cent to $33.41. Meanwhile shares in Caterpillar were 0.6 per cent lower at $64.43 after recouping some early losses driven by worries about its Chinese sales.Merck’s stock advanced after the drugmaker raised its earnings forecast for the year. Its shares were 2.3 per cent higher at $44.15.Home Depot said it expected sales to slow because of the weak housing market. Shares in the retailer were 0.6 per cent lower at $39.59.
387;HD;Home Depot;2007-02-28T20:48:26Z;Home Depot’s overhaul;;Keeping your house in order can be tedious. Putting it off, though, will only make for a bigger clean-up later on. To its credit, Home Depot is openly admitting as much. It has pushed its earnings guidance for the year down the kitchen sink, with diluted earnings per share forecast to decline between 4 per cent and 9 per cent.That is mainly a result of hefty spending on its retail operations. The $2.2bn pencilled in for such things as revamping its stores, improving logistics and staffing include $600m in additional operating expenses. This will take time to pay off. But other measures, such as offering repair professionals better deals, could help the home improvement retailer recoup some lost market share fairly quickly.Home Depot’s new management is also fittingly cautious on forecasting a rebound in US housing – unlike Lowe’s, its main rival. Fighting harder over a shrinking turf is likely to hurt both. But at least Home Depot is doing what it can to prepare investors and its long-suffering staff for coming battles.The only trouble is that “cautious” is a relative term when it comes to home improvement stores. Home Depot’s guidance for the next fiscal year is roughly consistent with analysts’ forecasts. It translates into a price-earnings multiple of about 12.8. That is well below Lowe’s, and not all that high, until you consider that it would leave earnings about 14 per cent higher than for the year ending January 2006 – when the largest housing boom in US history was still in full swing. Moreover, defending Home Depot’s hefty margins and returns on capital in a maturing sector will be hard. The same is true for Lowe’s, which also offers less upside from international expansion. But neither stock is a bargain yet.
388;HD;Home Depot;2007-02-23T22:34:27Z;US home improvement;;These days, managing a home improvement retailer is a bit like revamping your attic. Progress might be slow but it can still impress onlookers no end. On Friday, Lowe’s reported an 11.5 per cent year-on-year drop in fourth-quarter earnings. Its shares promptly rose by about 4 per cent. That seems rather generous – after all, the main reason profits did not fall quite as much as investors had feared was an unexpected drop in Lowe’s underlying tax rate.Then again, shareholders have also been warming up to Home Depot, Lowe’s larger rival, since it changed its chief executive in January. The new boss, Frank Blake, has been making the right noises, from putting the retailer’s wholesale business on the block to reaching out to disgruntled employees and investors.But Mr Blake will face some tough choices when he unveils Home Depot’s recovery plans next Wednesday. Closing the gap with Lowe’s on customer satisfaction would probably require hefty spending on refurbishing stores, employees and distribution systems – and it would take time. This could ultimately pay off but investors might resent any short-term toll on margins.Mr Blake’s task at Home Depot will be easier if Lowe’s is right in predicting gradual improvements in sales for 2007. This does not appear to be predicated on market share gains: the 5.3 per cent year-on-year decline in same-store sales for the last quarter at Lowe’s was only a touch less awful than at Home Depot. Thus Lowe’s fairly upbeat outlook statement appears mainly a bet on a soft landing for US housing. Given that a weaker economy forced Lowe’s to cut its guidance twice last year, investors – and Mr Blake at Home Depot – would be unwise to lend too much credence to its forecasting skills.
389;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Global overview: Uncertainty across financial markets;;The yen continued to retreat on Tuesday as financial markets remained on tenterhooks ahead of Wednesday’s interest rate decision by the Bank of Japan.But there was a growing view that whether or not the BoJ raised rates, there was little risk just yet of a sharp unwinding of “carry trades”, in which investors sell low-yielding currencies such as the yen to fund long positions in high-yielders.“In selling the yen this past 48 hours or so, the foreign exchange market seems to have formed the opinion that no matter the outcome of Thursday’s meeting, Japanese interest rates will remain low, stable and hence conducive to the yen carry trade,” said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York.Michael Vaknin, at Goldman Sachs, pointed out that a clear communication by the BoJ on its policy intentions would be important in determining the outlook for the yen.“In this environment we expect a very gradual rise in rates – factoring only one more hike this year, most likely in the fourth quarter,” Mr Vaknin said. “This fairly benign path of yen short rates should . . . continue supporting the performance of high-yielding currencies.”The uncertain mood in the foreign exchanges spilled over to equity and bond markets.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average closed a fraction lower, while the Topix index eased back from a 15-year peak to end 0.2 per cent higher. Japanese government bonds failed to make much headway.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.3 per cent from Monday’s six-year closing high. Oil stocks were among the biggest fallers as crude prices suffered hefty losses.Wall Street managed to recoup opening losses as bid and merger activity helped offset a disappointing set of quarterly results from Home Depot.At the close in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent, the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent higher and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7 per cent.Treasury bond prices rose modestly, as investors awaited the release on Wednesday of US consumer price figures for January. Investors will be looking for evidence to back up the Federal Reserve’s relatively relaxed view on inflation.Lehman Brothers on Tuesday said it felt the US central bank’s assessment of the inflation outlook was too sanguine. “First, the Fed is assuming oil prices will follow the soft path priced into the futures market,” said Ethan Harris, chief US economist.“By contrast, Lehman Brothers’ energy economist, Ed Morse, expects a sharp rebound in oil prices. Our second quibble with the Fed’s inflation view is that it has a more benign view of labour cost pressures,” Mr Harris added.Oil prices on Tuesday dropped amid continued expectations for warmer weather in the US. Some market participants were surprised that growing geo-political tensions surrounding Iran’s nuclear ambitions had not had more of an impact on crude prices.West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, traded below $58 a barrel, before closing at $58.07 in New York, down from $59.39 at Friday’s close.The weak oil price and firmer dollar helped drive gold back from a seven-month high, reached on Monday.Barclays Capital said that in spite of signs that momentum was slowing, gold still had the potential to maker further gains. Copper lost ground, but tin and nickel held near long-term highs.
390;HD;Home Depot;2007-02-20T21:41:30Z;Wall Street boosted by radio deal;;US stocks recovered early losses to close modestly higher on Tuesday, boosted by a string of corporate deals including a proposed merger between XM and Sirius, the satellite radio operators.The lift from the M&A activity was offset by a sharp fall in oil prices that depressed the energy sector.Shares in ExxonMobil were 0.6 per cent lower at $74.87 while Baker Hughes, the oil services group, was 2.2 per cent softer at $63.60.The S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent higher at 1,457.64. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to close on a record high of 12,787.04.Wal-Mart led the way upwards, with shares in the retailer advancing 3.7 per cent to $50.26 on the back of better-than-expected quarterly results and upbeat guidance.But shareholders in Home Depot fared less well, after the retailer said its quarterly profit fell 28 per cent because of the weak US housing market. Shares in Home Depot stood 0.2 per cent weaker at $41.34.Morgan Stanley cut its recommendation on JetBlue’s stock after a bad week in which the airline’s operations were crippled by a snowstorm, leaving some passengers stranded.David Neeleman, chief executive, said the cost of the disruptions might be more than $30m, sending shares in JetBlue down by 4.9 per cent to $12.90.Investors reacted positively to news of a possible merger between XM and Sirius, the US satellite operators, in spite of uncertainty over regulatory hurdles.The deal is described as “a merger of equals” which gives shareholders in Sirius and XM an equal stake of the combined group that would include radio shows by Oprah Winfrey and Howard Stern, the so-called shock-jock.Regulators would need to assess whether combining the only two groups permitted to offer satellite radio in the US would be in the public interest. For the deal to be sanctioned, the Federal Communications Commission would have to overturn its own rule prohibiting such a merger.Shares in Sirius and XM were up 5.9 per cent and 10.2 per cent respectively to $3.92 and $15.41. This helped to lift the tech-led Nasdaq Composite 0.7 per cent to stand at 2,513.04.In other deal news, Vulcan Materials, which makes roadbuilding materials, said it had agreement for a $4.6bn cash and stock offer to buy Florida Rock Industries.Shares in Florida Rock were up 41.7 per cent to $66.54 while shares in Vulcan were 0.6 per cent down at $111.14.Shire, the UK drugs group, said it had agreed to buy New River Pharmaceuticals, its US partner, for $2.6bn in cash.The move gives the UK company full control of Vyvanse, the two groups’ new drug for attention deficit disorder. Shares in New River were 8.3 per cent higher at $63.19.
391;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
392;HD;Home Depot;2007-02-12T21:51:10Z;Wall St lower on housing concerns;;Trading on Wall Street was languid on Monday as stocks were dragged down by weaker oil prices and lingering worries over the US housing market.The suggestion by Saudi Arabia’s oil minister that the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries might keep its output levels unchanged sent oil prices $2.08 lower to $57.81. The fall weighed heavily on the energy sector, with shares in Exxon down 0.8 per cent to $74.60 and Chevron 1.4 per cent softer at $72.32.Meanwhile, shares in homebuilders, mortgage lenders and real estate investment trusts continued to sink as investors brooded over last week’s warnings about lending to borrowers with weak credit and what this may imply for the property market and wider US economy.New Century Financial, the sub-prime lender, slipped a further 5.5 per cent to $17.21 and Countrywide was 3.3 per cent down at $40.84.Fears that rising defaults in the sub-prime sector might be the harbinger of wider troubles also hit shares in Reits, with the MSCI US Reit Index 1.9 per cent lower. Among homebuilders, DR Horton was 2.6 per cent weaker at $27.33.The S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,433.37 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent lower at 2,450.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent weaker at 12,552.55.“The market is trying to recover from Friday’s weakness,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader. “But it is concerned that short-term interest may continue to rise.”In separate news, Home Depot surprised investors by saying it was considering the possible spin-off, sale or flotation of HD Supply, the wholesale distribution business. Its shares were up 1.1 per cent to $41.44.Shares in Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 3.3 per cent to $27.59 after reports of a break-down in the merger talks with Sanofi-Aventis.Onyx Pharmaceuticals was boosted by news of a particularly successful trial of its Nexavar drug for treating liver cancer. Its shares leapt 97 per cent to $24.14.Analysts at Citigroup raised their recommendation on Apple from “hold” to “buy”, sending shares in the technology group up 1.9 per cent to $84.88. Richard Garner cited the boost from recent product launches and argued that falling prices for memory chips would help to improve margins.Southwest Airlines saw its shares climb 4.1 per cent to $15.77 after analysts at Bear Stearns lifted their recommendation on the stock.Four Seasons said it had agreed to a $3.8bn offer from a consortium led by the hotel operator’s founder. The bid was below some investors’ expectations and the shares fell 3 per cent to $81.36.Shares in Fortress Investment, the hedge fund and private equity group that floated on Friday, dipped by more than 8 per cent before recovering to 2.4 per cent lower at $30.25.
393;HD;Home Depot;2007-02-12T20:05:14Z;Home Depot disposal;;Frank Blake, the new chief executive of Home Depot, has given his growing number of fans another reason to celebrate. Exploring a sale of the retailer’s wholesale building supply division is unlikely to fix the underlying problems in the core business. But shareholders have long struggled to understand why Home Depot bought into the sector in the first place. They are likely to appreciate the latest signal that Mr Blake is willing to listen.Sentiment aside, the potential upside looks limited. Building supplies account for about 13 per cent of Home Depot’s revenues. Margins are much lower, leaving their contribution to profits below 10 per cent. Home Depot, moreover, was rather generous in its purchases, spending $4.4bn on 10 deals in the first nine months of 2006 alone.That suggests it might struggle to realise much of a paper gain from the assets’ $8bn or so current book value. At about two-thirds of trailing revenues and about nine times trailing operating profits, such a price tag might seem stingy by recent sector standards. But a sale of the whole lot to a trade buyer is unlikely. While Home Depot’s business with professional contractors is still small compared with the highly fragmented market for building supplies, it is already larger than most listed rivals.Selling on the various pieces might make more sense, not least as synergies have so far been limited. That, however, will take more time. Building supplies have proved more resilient than Home Depot’s retail stores, partly because of their bigger exposure to commercial construction. But a broader US slowdown would certainly affect them too. Indeed, Mr Blake’s latest conciliatory moves may be a sign that this has already started to happen. If so, it might take more than the prospect of share buy-backs to satisfy fans.
394;HD;Home Depot;2007-02-12T18:49:28Z;Home Depot may sell wholesale unit;;"Home Depot, the world’s biggest home improvement retailer, is considering the sale or spin-off of its large wholesale supplies division following pressure from activist shareholders for a change in strategy.Frank Blake, who replaced Bob Nardelli as chief executive last month, said the decision would allow the company to focus on its core retail business, which has been losing market share to Lowe’s.Disposal of the wholesale division would represent a damning repudiation of the strategy pursued by Mr Nardelli, who departed with a $210m pay-off after six years with the company.Home Depot spent about $6bn on acquisitions to build its wholesale business, which supplies construction and maintenance materials to commercial and public sector customers.The division has annual revenues of about $12bn – more than 15 per cent of the company’s total.Diversification into wholesale was at the heart of Mr Nardelli’s efforts to develop fresh sources of growth as the US home improvement market matured.But some investors complained that Home Depot was entering a lower-margin sector and worried that the retail business was being starved of management attention and resources.The company has appointed Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, to “evaluate strategic alternatives” for the division, known as HD Supply, which include a possible sale, spin-off or initial public offering.Cash-rich private equity groups are likely to be among the potential buyers.Private equity groups are rumoured to have been circling Home Depot for months with a view to
a $100bn leveraged buy-out
of the entire company.Disposal of the wholesale division would intensify speculation that the retail business could also be sold.Yesterday’s announcement was the latest in a series of bold steps by Mr Blake to restore investor confidence in Home Depot amid unrest over its sagging share price and corporate governance.Last week, the company granted a seat on its board to Relational, a California-based activist investment firm that has led the campaign for strategic change.Relational had threatened a shareholder rebellion against the board at Home Depot’s annual meeting in May if the company failed to change direction.Analysts have been surprised by the speed with which Mr Blake has moved to dismantle his predecessor’s legacy given that he was a senior executive under Mr Nardelli and played a central role in strategy and dealmaking.Mr Blake said HD Supply was “healthy, growing and vibrant business” but a strategic review was necessary to “optimise shareholder value”."
395;HD;Home Depot;2007-02-09T20:56:27Z;Licensed to curb a retail leviathan;;"Everything about Wal-Mart is outsized, from its annual revenues of more than $300bn (€192bn) to its 1.8m workers worldwide. It is new kind of retail giant, with nearly four times the sales of Home Depot, the number two American retailer. A company cannot grow that large without becoming symptom and symbol of everything that is changing fastest in society. No company saves shoppers more money. No company causes trade unions more headaches. And no company has ever faced a class-action suit larger than Dukes v Wal-Mart, which on Tuesday was given the go-ahead by a divided panel of three federal judges in California. Wal-Mart will seek a reversal. But, as it stands, six plaintiffs and their lawyers have been granted leave to sue for gender discrimination on behalf of about 1.6m women employees who have worked for Wal-Mart at any time since 1998.The decision is such a departure from traditional US court practice that, to explain it, we need to look somewhere other than the law. Class actions have tended to involve product liability and shareholder disputes – where the damage to one plaintiff resembles the damage to others. This is not such a case. The stories involve bosses who allegedly acted like jerks, in very different ways. There are more women on the plaintiffs’ list than there are in Wales. In a collectivity of that size, proving that several (or several hundred) individuals have been treated in sexist ways tells us little about the culture of the collectivity or its leadership. The plaintiffs feel wronged not by any Wal-Mart policy but, on the contrary, by the “subjective” criteria for pay increases and promotion used by individual managers.The plaintiffs allege that female workers are both underpaid and underpromoted. There is a fundamental illogic in that assertion. Successful legal attacks on Wal-Mart – including a class action in California in December 2005 where Wal-Mart was ordered (pending appeal) to pay $172m for denying workers lunch breaks – have illustrated a troubling pattern. Wal-Mart gets its “everyday low prices” through its willingness to do anything to shave costs. It regulates office chit-chat. It makes executives share hotel rooms on business trips. Sometimes, through tight and inflexible budgets, it gives managers incentives to squeeze employees in ways that fall foul of labour laws or common decency, or both. You can see why Wal-Mart might fight unionisation or turn a blind eye to Chinese manufacturing practices. Both are ways of reducing overheads.But this is exactly why the idea that Wal-Mart might hold women back makes no sense. If women were doing the same work as men for less money, as the suit alleges, could not this notoriously tight-fisted company obtain vast savings by promoting more women into managerial positions?Female managers at Wal-Mart make $89,280 a year on average, according to the plaintiffs, while men make $105,682. Female hourly workers earn $17,459 versus $18,609 for their male counterparts. In other words, Wal-Mart pays female managers 84½ cents for every dollar paid to male managers, and hourly-paid women 94 cents for every dollar paid to men. One may deplore this gap, but it does not constitute evidence of discrimination, given that the US Bureau of the Census reports that women as a whole make 75½ cents for every dollar earned by similarly situated men. Wal-Mart seems to be compensating its employees in a manner considerably less sexist than the society as a whole. The percentage of Wal-Mart’s managers who are women lies somewhere between 34 and 40 per cent. Again, one has every right to wish it were 50, but how does that compare with, say, legislatures? Or “public-interest” law firms?If you are upset by, say, the destruction of traditional US town centres, Wal-Mart is indeed part of the problem. If you are upset by workplace sexism, however, the company seems to be part of the solution. Unless you ignore US history and the structure of its society and postulate that there is no difference in the workplace priorities of men and women, the evidence that Wal-Mart is sexist looks feeble. It would appear that the real gripe of the suit – or, more accurately, of the activist lawyers who formulated it – lies elsewhere.The Dukes case does not arise from the specific problem of sexism; it arises from a vague but pervasive sentiment among intellectuals and politicians that Wal-Mart needs to be taken down a peg. Wal-Mart is so big it is not just a market-maker; it is a society-maker. It is almost governmental in its ubiquity and in its ability to reorganise lives. Everyone benefits from Wal-Mart’s low prices and is damaged by its wipe-out of small businesses. A countervailing force to the power of Wal-Mart would seem necessary and yet it is hard to say what it would be.Historically, when government has proved unable to regulate big enterprises, it has unleashed some hostile group on them, by granting permission to break society’s traditional rules. In the industrial economy, trade unions received the licence to coerce individual workers into surrendering their freedom to make individual contracts. The practical benefit to society – denting the impunity of big business – was held to outweigh the damage to the constitutional order. Today, the efforts of unions and antitrust laws having proved unavailing, it is trial lawyers who have been licensed to trammel Wal-Mart. They will inflict the punishment and reap the profits.We are only beginning to see the political consequences of Wal-Mart’s centralisation of so much of the retail industry. They will be vast – because retail is the exciting place where the economic order and the social order meet. Oddly, Wal-Mart may prove a godsend to a new generation of reformers and utopians. Trial lawyers, at least, are coming to believe that control of society rests with whoever controls the commanding heights of the retail sector.The writer is a senior editor at The Weekly Standard"
396;HD;Home Depot;2007-02-08T01:35:51Z;Blue chips in talks on UK-style pay vote;;US companies, including Pfizer, the drugmaker, and American International Group, the insurer, are seeking to avoid shareholder revolts by meeting leading investors to discuss holding UK-style votes on executive pay.The move underlines the growing influence of US pension funds on corporate governance, following the outcry over executive pay at companies such as Pfizer and Home Depot, the retailer.It also reflects some companies’ desire to avoid public stand-offs with investors, which have become more frequent since recent governance scandals.The talks, which follow a campaign by US and international pension funds to demand a greater say on executive pay, could pave the way for regulatory changes to introduce a non-binding annual shareholder vote.AIG, Pfizer and rival Schering-Plough confirmed they and other companies had agreed to talks in a “working group” with pension funds including the $220bn California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the biggest public workers’ union.AIG, Pfizer and Schering-Plough were among 44 companies targeted by an investor coalition that last month filed motions demanding a UK-style vote on pay – a move that turned executive pay into a battleground for the coming season of shareholder meetings.However, it is understood the motion against Pfizer has been withdrawn.“We do not follow the model that is ‘them’ and ‘us’,” said Peggy Foran, Pfizer’s corporate secretary. “We think that having shareholders discuss this or hearing feedback has a lot of merit.”The working group, which will hear from academic and corporate governance experts, is expected to meet for the first time on Friday. Other companies believed to be part of the discussions include the consumer group Colgate-Palmolive, the drugmaker Bristol Myers-Squibb and the conglomerate Tyco. They either declined to comment or were unavailable.People close to the talks said that all participants agreed that the proposal of a non-binding vote on compensation, which has been in force in the UK since 2003, had merit but needed to be adapted to the US legal and regulatory framework.The presence of pharmaceutical groups in the working group reflects their efforts to improve their public image. This has been a priority of Jeffrey Kindler, Pfizer’s new chief executive, who replaced Hank McKinnell last year.Mr McKinnell’s $200m severance package has been criticised by corporate governance experts particularly in light of the company’s share performance.However, Mr Kindler’s compensation package as new chief executive reflects Pfizer’s efforts to improve performance and image by tying pay more closely to shareholder returns.
397;HD;Home Depot;2007-02-06T22:17:32Z;Home Depot;;Shareholders hate unrepentant sinners. That was one of the reasons Home Depot’s former boss, Bob Nardelli, attracted so much ire. By contrast, Frank Blake has emerged as the home improvement retailer’s chief diplomat since taking over as chief executive a month ago.Mr Blake is trying to mend bridges with Home Depot’s many disgruntled stakeholders, most recently by reaching an agreement with Relational Investors and naming one of the activist shareholder’s co-founders to Home Depot’s board. That looks astute. It avoids a distracting proxy fight when management should devote its energy on fixing the business. Together with the looming departure of four board members especially close to Mr Nardelli, it should also buy Mr Blake some extra time to prove himself.But investors are right not to wholeheartedly embrace Home Depot in the spirit of forgiveness just yet. Repentance is a good start, but swift progress is another matter. For example, Relational may have a point that the costly expansion in building supplies for professional contractors will not pay off. Even if its representative, David Batchelder, convinced the rest of the board to divest building supplies, getting a good price seems unlikely.Having Mr Batchelder on the board should focus attention on improving Home Depot’s core operations. But after years of spending too little on its stores and micro-managing every last detail from head office, it will take a while to restore staff morale and lure in new shoppers. Home Depot will have to do that at the same time as cost pressures seem to be rising and further woes in US housing could drag down revenues. It also has an operating margin of 11 per cent to defend, which looks punchy for a retailer.
398;HD;Home Depot;2007-01-31T21:19:55Z;FDIC extends Wal-Mart bank freeze;;Federal regulators voted on Wednesday to extend for a further 12 months a freeze on granting new state banking licences to retailers and other commercial companies.The move by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may mark the end of efforts by Wal-Mart and Home Depot, the two largest US retailers, to open their own state-chartered industrial banks, amid moves in Congress to exclude commercial companies from the sector.A bank application from DaimlerChrysler, the car company, will also be blocked by the FDIC move, which will not apply to industrial banks owned by financial companies.Sheila Bair, FDIC chairman, said in a statement that themove reflected the public policy concerns generated by the growth in commercial ownership of the banks, known as industrial loan corporations (ILCs).“The moratorium will provide Congress with an opportunity to address the issue legislatively while the FDIC considers how best to respond to any safety and soundness issues surrounding commercial ownership under existing law,” she said.Wal-Mart’s bank application, filed in summer 2005, provoked vigorous opposition from a range of opponents, including the banking industry. The retailer says it wanted a bank licence to reduce the costs of electronic payment processing. Home Depot last year sought FDIC approval for its takeover of Enerbank, a Utah-based industrial bank that it said it wanted to use to issue loans to small contractors.Target, the discounter that is Wal-Mart’s main US rival, already owns an industrial bank that it uses to issue credit cards to businesses and other institutions.The FDIC also approved a proposed rule that would strengthen supervision of ILCs owned by financial companies that are not themselves covered by federal banking law.There are currently 58 ILCs is seven states, more than 40 of them in Utah.Ms Bair described industrial banks as having “a history of strength and innovation” and said the proposed regulation ensures that they “will continue to remain safe and important participants in the financial system and that the parent company will be a source of strength and not a source of risk”.On Monday, Barney Frank, chairman of the House financial services committee, introduced a bill that would exclude companies that derive over 85 per cent of their revenue from commerce from owning ILCs.While the measure is expected to advance through the House, it is likely to face opposition in the Senate from Robert Bennett, the Utah senator who is a senior member of the Senate banking committee.
399;HD;Home Depot;2007-01-30T23:35:17Z;US regulators to extend block on retail banks;;Federal regulators are expected to agree today to extend a moratorium that has blocked controversial bids by Wal-Mart and Home Depot, the largest US retailers, to establish their own banks.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is responsible for supervising about 60 state-chartered industrial banks, announced a six-month freeze on approving new licences last July, citing the need for more debate over the issue.It is now expected to extend the freeze on licence applications from commercial companies by a further 12 months, giving the new Democrat-led Congress an opportunity to pass legislation that would tighten restrictions on ownership of the banks.Wal-Mart’s application to open an industrial bank in Utah in 2005 sparked bitter opposition from the banking industry and from the retailer’s political opponents who argue that such banks undermine federal laws that seek to separate banking and commerce.The application also drew attention to the continuing rapid expansion of state industrial loan corporations (ILCs), which fall outside the provisions of the federal bank holding company law and the supervision of the Federal Reserve.Wal-Mart has said it wants the bank to reduce the costs of handling credit card and electronic payments, and that it has no plans to expand into retail banking, as claimed by opponents.Last year, Home Depot, the second-largest US retailer, also sought approval from the FDIC for its purchase of Enerbank, another Utah-based industrial bank. Home Depot said it wanted the bank to provide financing packages for small contractors who use its stores.The FDIC’s initial moratorium deferred a decision on the bank applications until after November’s elections, which led to the Democrats taking control of both houses of Congress.Barney Frank, a Democratic opponent of the Wal-Mart bank bid who now heads the House banking committee, and Paul Gillmor, a Republican, this week introduced a new bill aimed at preventing commercial companies from owning industrial banks.
400;HD;Home Depot;2007-01-26T21:42:13Z;Global trade unionism;;“Workers of the world, unite” is one of socialism’s more hopeful slogans. Right now, though, there are renewed calls for bigger, cross-border unions in the face of globalisation. Amicus, the UK’s largest private sector union, looks set to merge with the Transport & General Workers’ Union, which is currently at loggerheads with British Airways. Intriguingly, Amicus has also signed co-operation agreements with peers in Germany and the US and predicts the creation of a global union within a decade.A combined Amicus/T&G’s 2m members would make it the country’s largest union. But that should be set in the context of total union membership having almost halved from a peak of 13.2m in 1979. Global unions would face obstacles in the form of clashing labour laws and working practices in different jurisdictions. At the extreme, it is difficult to envisage workers in an emerging economy downing tools in solidarity with their western counterparts, particularly if it is over, say, the issue of offshoring jobs.Multilateral strikes look unlikely, although certain globally consolidated industries, such as some mining sectors, are theoretically more vulnerable than others. More importantly, however, the call for solidarity reflects wider concerns about the effects of globalisation. Profits as a proportion of the developed world’s gross domestic product are at their highest in four decades – and wages at their lowest. Concrete examples of rising inequality, such as Robert Nardelli’s severance package from Home Depot, mean that talk of globalisation’s benefits has little resonance with many western workers. And all workers in democracies, unionised or not, can vote.In parallel, protectionist tendencies are growing. Even Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke, while warning against trade barriers, finds it hard to conceal his frustration with China these days. For those equity investors banking on company profit growth maintaining the breakneck pace of recent years, the risk is less that workers unite but that trading partners divide.
401;HD;Home Depot;2007-01-24T22:10:55Z;Home Depot pay;;Frank Blake is not going to starve with his $8.9m pay package. But the Home Depot board has taken the hair shirt approach with its new chief executive when compared with the finest Italian silk enjoyed by his predecessor Bob Nardelli. For example, Mr Blake will get a base salary of $975,000 compared with Mr Nardelli’s $2.25m. His targeted cash bonus is $1.95m. Mr Nardelli received $7m in 2005.All that is little surprise. The board is under intense scrutiny following the scandal over the huge pay packet Mr Nardelli received when he was forced out. It could not afford another massively generous contract to lure in another rock-star CEO from the outside. (Even if it had wanted to, which is doubtful after its experience last time round with Mr Nardelli).Mr Blake is about consistency. He has been closely involved in the current strategy of expanding beyond home improvement into wholesale building supplies. He is also somewhat of a risk, having never been CEO of a public company before.But the key issue the board has tried to address is that Mr Blake needs to perform where Mr Nardelli failed – in boosting the shares. Most of his compensation is tied to share price performance while Mr Nardelli was largely incentivised on earnings per share growth. That change makes sense – although Home Depot could have tied pay to a more demanding level of performance compared with other S&P500 companies or to performance relative to a more relevant benchmark of retail peers.Mr Blake is entitled to no severance payouts. He has a challenge to prove Home Depot’s strategy can work and will be richly rewarded if he does. But at least the board is finally sending the right message by not giving him a huge safety net if he fails.
402;HD;Home Depot;2007-01-22T17:47:59Z;Praise the company that stays public, for it does good work;;I know what you’re thinking: “Why am I working in such a transparent business . . . a public company, making $1m or $2m and getting beaten up all the time? Why not run a private business?”OK, so perhaps not all of you are thinking in precisely those terms. But the sentiment – outlined by David Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle private equity group, in a recent interview in Business Week – may be widely held. Who needs to be Sarbanes-Oxley-compliant, filing quarterly reports and worrying every moment what analysts (or the press) may have got hold of? Why not just get your head down, run the business and earn some serious money?Certainly, the conventional wisdom at the start of 2007 is that all the fun is being had in private business. Henry Silverman, former chief executive of the now-broken-up leisure and real estate conglomerate Cendant, told the New York Times recently: “There is no reason to be a public company any more.”From a CEO’s point of view you can see what he means. When Robert Nardelli left Home Depot earlier this month, his humiliation at the hands of shareholders was complete. Even if he did walk away with a consoling $210m in his back pocket, the damage to his reputation was considerable. Hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman declared: “I think it will be a long time before Bob Nardelli gets involved in a public company again.”There seems to be a dreadful inevitability about the phenomenon of private equity at the moment. No company’s future – not even Pearson’s, the owner of this newspaper – can be discussed without the possibility of a private equity bid being raised. My colleague John Plender’s satirical suggestion last summer that Microsoft could become a target got plenty of tongues wagging. Public markets are suddenly too boring. Why not wade into the deep and enticing pools of capital on offer at the private equity firms?Freed from the intrusive gaze of institutional shareholders, it is said, management can take the bold and radical steps needed to turn businesses round without being penalised by investors in the short term. Relatively low interest rates allow companies to borrow cheaply while dramatically cutting costs. This sort of thinking informed Sir Philip Green’s 2004 bid for the British retailer Marks and Spencer when he offered M&S investors £4 a share to take the company private.Turning down Sir Philip’s offer now looks like one of the better decisions those shareholders have ever made (current M&S share price: flirting with the £7 mark). What M&S has shown is that it is entirely possible for public companies to execute a recovery if the right leadership is in place and if investors give managers the time they need to deliver.Just a few steps down the UK high street from your nearest M&S, you might find a branch of Debenhams, another retailer that has, unlike M&S, experienced private equity ownership in the past few years (2003-2006) prior to being floated again last year.Here the story is rather different. Debenhams’ temporary owners did very well out of the deal, selling off valuable properties and issuing huge dividends to themselves. But having rejoined the stock market in May, the company’s performance has been disappointing. And Debenhams’ share price has slipped from 195p at flotation to about 170p today.Running a public company is a huge responsibility. It is also a noble and worthwhile task. At a time when some are questioning the very legitimacy of business, the ethical public company is the key exhibit in the case for the defence: a big, transparent and responsible citizen.Had Stuart Rose, the M&S boss, chosen to lead the company turnround for private owners, he might now be tens of millions of pounds richer. But M&S would most likely be a smaller and less distinguished company. It would also almost certainly not have committed to spending £200m over the next five years in an attempt to become “carbon neutral”.Given that private equity owners often seek nothing more than the most rapid return possible to the stock market, you have to wonder whether this form of ownership can lay claim to any special virtues at all.Managers should be stewards of their companies, not merely their semi-detached financial engineers. To illustrate the difference, consider people who think “home” and people who think “house” about the place where they live, says Mark Goyder, director of the London-based think-tank Tomorrow’s Company. If you think “home” there is an assumption of continuity. “Money is spent that cannot be recovered in the event of an early sale but adds to the individual character of that home,” he says.“Others, particularly those who expect to be moving on again in a few years, make a much simpler payback calculation. They accept what they inherit by way of carpets and colour schemes and avoid spending on the longer term, knowing that their time will soon come to sell.”When simply everyone is plugging private equity, the chances are that things have gone too far. Even the Carlyle Group’s Mr Rubenstein has noticed. So many high-flying graduates want in, he says, that not enough people seem to be going into other professions – medicine, for example. As he told Business Week: “I always say I would hate to be operated on by someone in the next 10 years.”Now Mr Rubenstein is worried that the success that firms such as his are enjoying could attract the attention of legislators. Might he just possibly be guilty of hubris? You decide: “The Declaration of Independence says we are supposed to pursue happiness but, when people are too happy, the government doesn’t like it. And right now, private equity is very happy.”
403;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Home Depot chief Nardelli steps down;;"Bob Nardelli resigned as chairman and chief executive of Home Depot on Wednesday, delivering victory to shareholder activists who hounded him for accepting hefty pay increases while the share price of the largest home improvement chain in the US slumped.Mr Nardelli, a former protégé of Jack Welch at General Electric known for his aggressive management style, had been in trouble since a stormy confrontation with investors at Home Depot’s annual meeting last year.Shareholders questioned why Mr Nardelli continued to receive one of the largest pay packages in corporate America despite a persistent decline in the company’s share price since his appointment in 2000.Mr Nardelli was replaced with immediate effect by Frank Blake, Home Depot’s vice chairman and another GE veteran.Shares in Home Depot were up 3 per cent, at $41.48, in early trading following the announcement, compared with $40.75 the day before Mr Nardelli took the helm.Home Depot said that, under the terms of his contract, Mr Nardelli would receive a severance package worth $210m, in addition to the more than $120m that he has received in compensation since joining the company.Iinvestors have asked a Georgia state court to issue an injunction blocking the retailer from paying former mr Nardelli the severance package.“Nardelli’s severance package is a final, indefensible step by the board of directors in wrongly over-compensating an unsuccessful chief executive,” plaintiffs said in papers asking for a temporary restraining order.Mr Nardelli, who lost out to Jeffrey Immelt in the race to succeed Mr Welch as chairman of GE in 2000, was credited with bringing greater focus and discipline to Home Depot, previously known for its free-wheeling culture.But, despite earnings per share more than doubling under his leadership and sales increasing from $45.7bn to $81.5bn, Mr Nardelli failed to maintain the more rapid growth of earlier years and performance lagged behind that of Lowe’s, the second-largest US home improvement retailer.Mr Nardelli sought to offset the slowdown in Home Depot’s core retail business by expanding into Canada, Mexico and China and diversifying into the wholesale supplies sector, serving commercial and industrial customers.The company said it remained committed to the strategic path set by Mr Nardelli but his departure appeared certain to intensify persistent speculation that it could be the target of a $100bn leveraged buy-out by private equity firms.In a statement, Mr Nardelli said he was “extremely proud” of his record since joining the company. “I believe that I leave a stronger and more resilient company than when I arrived, and one that is well positioned to capitalise on the substantial opportunities ahead of it,” he said.Home Depot said Mr Nardelli’s resignation was made by mutual agreement following a board meeting on Tuesday. In a statement, the company praised his “strong leadership” over the past six years. “Under Bob’s tenure, the company made significant and necessary investments that greatly improved the company’s infrastructure and operations,” it said.Relational, the San Diego-based activist investment firm that last month mounted a challenge to Home Depot's management, declined to comment on Mr Nardelli's resignation. One person close to Relational said it would be viewed as a ""significant step"" but that the board and the management still faced ""major strategic issues"". Relational is still expecting to meet Home Depot this month to discuss its proposals for a new strategic direction, the person said."
404;HD;Home Depot;2007-01-10T20:22:33Z;Headhunters now headline hunters?;;"Aviva’s designation of Andrew Moss as successor to chief executive Richard Harvey was accompanied by a name-check for Anna Mann of MWM Consulting as having “assisted and advised on the process”.It was the second time in two days that a search firm had been publicly credited in a director’s appointment.On Tuesday, UK Athletics cited Odgers Sports Practice as handling the search that found Edmond Warner to be non-executive chairman.What is going on in headhunting, once a realm of discretion, even if there were few real secrets?It appears that the main push for publicity is coming from clients, who want to be seen to have consulted experts to assure investors they have ticked all the good-governance boxes.This is especially true when the successful candidate is internal, as with Moss, who will step up from finance director.So, in the name of transparency, Aviva went into considerable detail about how it benchmarked a shortlist of external candidates against ones from the inside.Mann will know from bitter experience the downside when things go wrong. While at Whitehead Mann, her search led to the ill-fated nomination of Sir Ian Prosser as chairman of J Sainsbury. Institutional opposition led to Prosser’s withdrawal and later to the spectacle of WM’s then-chief executive Stephen Lawrence blaming the client.So an element of “we’re all in it together” may lie behind announcements like the two this week.(One headhunter, however, on Wednesday recalled once being offered a mention in return for a reduced fee; she declined.)It’s worth remembering, as well, Bob Nardelli, who recently quit under fire at Home Depot with a $210m (£108m) pay-off.There was much crowing on the part of search firm Heidrick & Struggles on its role in landing Nardelli for the US DIY retailer.Not much of it recently.Sorry, petalShortly before Christmas, Claire Hunte, commercial director of financial publisher Cross Border, was sent a big bunch of flowers.The card, wishing her a speedy recovery, was signed by Deloitte’s ERS – for “enterprise risk services” – team. Hunte wondered: “Did they know I was suffering from a cold? Or was it a thinly veiled threat from the ERS mafia?”The flowers, in fact, had been sent by the design house Twentysix London and the florist had mixed up the cards. Hunte, and Mudlark, hope the intended recipient of the Deloitte bouquet did get well soon.All in the familyRick Bendel, Asda’s new marketing director, knows how to make a quick impact. The former chief operating officer of advertising agency network Publicis Worldwide put the supermarket chain’s account up for review as one of his first actions.The losing agency? Publicis UK. It may be some comfort for Publicis staffers that the winning agency – Fallon – at least is part of the same holding group, confusingly also called Publicis. It might make more sense in French.With Tesco, Asda and Wm Morrison all ditching their long-serving agencies over the last 18 months, the folks at AMV BBDO, the agency behind the J Sainsbury campaigns, might be ruffled. But, then, everyone loves those Jamie Oliver ads.

Not an original joke, but still amusing.John Hastings, partner at pension consultants Hymans Robertson, said “leak” and “stream” came to mind, but “given the proliferation, a ‘gush’ seems more appropriate”.That’s the best so far.Spam begets spamAnother gem for the “embarrassing e-mails made public” collection. Cluttons, the estate agent, e-mailed hundreds of people to advertise a buy-to-let opportunity near Canary Wharf. The agent put recipients’ addresses in the “cc” box instead of “bcc”, so everyone could read each other’s contact details.As well as the expected assortment of finance, property and Hotmail addresses, there was one called “swastika”.Cue objections – to the spamming, rather than the swastika address – from diverse recipients including a solicitor, an architect and the managing director of a risk consultancy, all of whom copied their messages to the hundreds of original recipients.The managing director wrote: “Having successfully avoided my ex-girlfriend you have given her my e-mail address. Boiling bunnies everywhere! I insist Cluttons [offer] me a free apartment as an apology!!”If it’s any consolation, the list of hundreds of buy-to-let investors could probably be sold for a tidy sum.

405;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Shareholder-friendly US, governance-shy Europe;;Home Depot is the start of somethingRobert Nardelli’s disregard for shareholders was extreme even by US standards, as was the mismatch between his performance and reward. The defenestration of this high handed chief executive from Home Depot last week thus had all the marks of a symbolic turning point towards greater shareholder accountability.His departure comes after a push in the same shareholder-friendly direction by the Paulson committee on capital market regulation. And it is noteworthy that Barney Frank, the incoming chairman of the House financial services committee, has hinted that having shareholders vote on chief executive pay may be the way to address the fat cat pay issue.By contrast, continental Europe seems to be losing impetus on the corporate governance front, with poison pills making a comeback. The latest case concerns ThyssenKrupp whose annual meeting on January 19 includes a motion to give disproportionate representation on the supervisory board in relation to the share stake of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach foundation. This comes against a background of hostile bids and consolidation in steel.A countermotion is being proposed by Vereinigung Institutioneller Privatanleger, the association of institutional shareholders, which is highlighting the fact that the change is being promoted by a supervisory board chairman, Gerhard Cromme, who spearheaded Germany’s corporate governance code. That looks like a symbolic case of revisionism.Controversy also surrounds the fact that Mr Cromme is one of many in Germany’s top companies to have moved up from the chief executive role to the chairmanship. The Berlin government is pondering whether to take action on such moves upstairs.Shareholders are also on the defensive in the Netherlands, where Centaurus Capital and Paulson, hedge funds with a combined stake of 31.4 per cent in the Stork industrial conglomerate, have been trying to urge deconglomeration on the management.They have now become victims of a poison pill as Stichting Stork, a legally independent but related foundation, has exercised a call option on preference shares that have given it close to 50 per cent of Stork’s ordinary shares.As well as seeking an injunction against the poison pill in the courts, the hedge funds are calling for the dismissal of the supervisory board at a meeting on January 18. Yet the odds against them are formidable, even though 86.5 per cent of shareholders backed their proposals at a meeting in October. The message is that shareholder rights are once again under siege in governance-weary Europe.Emerging M&ADeveloping countries have long been exporting capital to the developed world through the investment of their official reserves in government and government agency bonds in the US and elsewhere.The bid battle between Brazil’s Companhia Siderurgica Nacional and India’s Tata Steel for Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steel group, underlines the point that the flow from poor to rich now also takes the form of direct investment via cross-border mergers and acquisitions.The flow is hugely helped by the ready availability of credit at historically low spreads. In fact strategists at Bank of America estimate that developing countries spent a record $548bn (£284bn) on cross-border M&A deals in 2006, accounting for 15 per cent of the global total. Much of this was between developing countries. Were it not for US and European protectionism the figure for bids in the developed world would be much larger.There is a certain poetic justice in this. Dani Rodrik of Harvard has estimated that the loss to developing countries from the build up of their reserves in low-yielding bonds amounts to close to 1 per cent of gross domestic product. M&A into the developed world offers the possibility of a higher positive return to off-set this cost, which amounts to an expensive insurance premium against financial crises.The snag is that the cheap credit window may not stay open for long. And some bids, notably in steel, may prove expensive if this is the peak of the cycle. The recent plunge in the copper market, well described by Charles Dumas of Lombard Street Research in October as an accident waiting to happen, looks like a serious setback in the China-driven commodities bull market story.Pro-market viewEvents at Home Depot remind me of one of J.K.Galbraith’s best aphorisms. “The salary of the chief executive of the large corporations is not a market award for achievement. It is frequently in the nature of a warm personal gesture by the individual to himself.” The arrival of compensation committees seems not to have made much difference.john.plender@ft.comJohn Plender is chairman designate of Quintain plc.

buyers.Stronger-than-expected job creation in December sent stocks lower on Friday and tipped them into negative territory for the week. Equity investors began the year optimistic that a Federal Reserve rate cut before June would offset slower earnings growth.“A rate cut is looking less likely in the first half of this year,” said Gerald Lucas, senior investment adviser at Deutsche Bank. “The most important factor for the equity market this year will be evidence of inflation moderating and trending lower as it will give the Fed the flexibility to cut rates should the economy slow further.”The S&P 500 settled down 0.6 per cent at 1,409.71 on Friday, a fall of 0.6 per cent this week. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent lower at 2,434.25, but was 0.8 per cent higher for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had slipped 0.7 per cent to 12,398.01, a fall of 0.5 per cent this week, and was down from a new record high of 12,580.35 on Wednesday.Although a $6 plunge in the price of oil this week should help allay fears of inflation, energy stocks were hit hard and the S&P 500 energy index slid 4.8 per cent for the week. But the S&P information technology sector was 1.5 per cent firmer.Among technology stocks that fared well was BMC Software, rising 8.4 per cent to $34.92, while Yahoo, which declined 35 per cent last year, rose 8.6 per cent to $27.74. Another laggard from 2006 was Intel, but the stock rose 4.2 per cent to $21.10 this week and was the best stock in the Dow.Cisco shares rallied 4.2 per cent to $28.47 after the company announced that it had bought e-mail security company IronPort Systems for $830m.“Technology has a higher weighting in our portfolios than was the case a year ago,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at RiverSource Investments.He said large software companies were also attractive “as they are very good cashflow generators and trade at cheap multiples”.Not all tech shares rose. Motorola plunged 7.9 per cent to $18.94 for the week after the mobile phone maker said lower sales would reduce fourth quarter earnings below estimates.AT&T led the Dow lower this week, falling 5 per cent to $33.96.

to $70.55. ConocoPhillips slumped 6.3 per cent to $67.42 after the oil producer lowered refining and marketing margins for the fourth quarter.Wal-Mart rose 2.6 per cent to $47.39 as its same-store sales were better than expected, making it the second best performing stock in the Dow.Goodyear Tire & Rubber shares jumped 10.9 per cent to $23.28 after an upgrade to “buy” from Deutsche.

407;HD;Home Depot;2007-01-05T20:11:59Z;On Wall Street: Nardelli deal reveals some Home truths;;It is hard to feel sympathy for Bob Nardelli. The Home Depot chief executive was pushed out this week with a $210m pay-off – a reward, on the face of it, for a share price lower than when he took the job in late 2000 and an attitude that grated with shareholders and employees alike.It looks as if dissatisfied investors finally forced the board to get rid of a failed, overpaid chief executive. Yet the real story is not that simple – nor are the implications for company policies on executive pay and recruitment.He had, after all, boosted sales and profits. As his biography boasted before it was removed from the company’s website: “The Home Depot is among just a few Dow 30 companies to achieve over 20 per cent earnings per share growth each year for the last four years.” This, presumably, is just what the company’s board wanted when it hired Mr Nardelli. A long-time star at General Electric, he left after being passed over, along with James McNerney, to succeed Jack Welch.Like King Lear, the celebrity chief executive had to help decide which of three possible heirs should take over his realm. The crown went to Jeff Immelt, and the two other men left to run other companies.Some of Mr Nardelli’s impressive $156m pay from 2000 to 2005 (excluding option grants) was, legitimately, pegged to financial benchmarks that improved on his watch. But lasting share price gains proved elusive. Measured on that metric alone, Mr McNerney has turned out to be the star among the three Welch protégés. His tenure at 3M saw the share price rise about 30 per cent. He moved to Boeing in mid-2005, since when the stock (admittedly on the way up when he joined) has soared 40 per cent. He has cost the two companies $108m on the same basis over the same period, according to figures from The Corporate Library.Mr Immelt has done no better than Mr Nardelli as far as share price is concerned. GE and Home Depot are both down a bit since the beginning of 2001 – just after Mr Nardelli took over at Home Depot, and soon after Mr Immelt was anointed to succeed Mr Welch (although he only became chief executive later that year). It is even possible to argue Home Depot had the bigger run-up before Mr Nardelli arrived, making his task harder (one reason chief executives’ performance pay is not linked solely to share price). But there is no angry crowd calling for Mr Immelt’s head.True, he has taken out less money than Mr Nardelli (about $123m during the same period) and GE is a much larger company. But their different situations also owe a lot to style. The Ivy League educated Mr Immelt is better at schmoozing investors and Wall Street analysts, explaining himself and his strategy, and dealing with employees.So is Mr Nardelli more sinned against than sinning? Hardly. But abrasiveness aside, one big mistake was his refusal to back down.Like Dick Grasso at the New York Stock Exchange, he failed to grasp that his pay was plainly out of line – quite a feat in the context of US executive compensation. A smoother operator might have accepted a scaling-back, or at least a spreading-out, of his package.The Home Depot board was not blameless, though. Like the NYSE’s, it nodded through a pay deal that with hindsight – and probably with proper foresight – looked excessive. There is even a common thread in the form of Ken Langone, a founder and director of Home Depot and board member at the exchange during Mr Grasso’s tenure.This is where the lessons come into play. Good chief executives cost money. But too often boards, usually peopled by other company bosses, have paid up for supposed A-list executives without pegging remuneration sufficiently carefully to performance.Hard financial and operational targets matter as well as share price. But Mr Nardelli’s rewards would not have looked so generous had he, like shareholders, still been waiting for more of them. His exit deal includes much that he had, rightly or wrongly, already earned. Thankfully, boards seem to be realising that additional payments – and accumulations that have not previously been clearly disclosed – make them look bad. Such highly paid individuals should not appear to gain by failing.Home Depot’s experience with Mr Nardelli suggests at least one other lesson. Financial considerations aside, boards need to find talent combined with at least a little humility. That can help avoid conflict – and unhappy endings.richard.beales@ft.com
408;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;It pays to simplify boardroom compensation;;Investors should be forever grateful to Robert Nardelli, the chief executive of Home Depot who has just walked off with a $210m severance package in exchange for years of lacklustre share price performance. For while it is galling to see failure so handsomely rewarded, he has at least demonstrated beyond all doubt how the arguments used by corporate America to justify the stock options culture are palpable nonsense.Mr Nardelli’s pay since taking office at the giant retailer in 2000 has been valued at more than $240m with much of it in the form of options. This, according to options advocates, aligned his interests with those of shareholders. Some alignment: shareholders in Home Depot lost real money, while Mr Nardelli secured a king’s ransom. Alignment with or without options is anyway a pipedream. Shareholders are a disparate bunch with different balance sheets, time horizons and risk appetites. The same applies to CEOs, who have differing personal balance sheets and operate under different behavioural constraints. No pay package will ever pull off the alignment trick, whatever pay consultants – an unregulated and conflicted bunch – may claim.Myth number two is that CEO pay determination is a market process. The reality is that the nomination and compensation committee members who secured the services of Mr Nardelli after his failure to win the top job at General Electric were a bunch of nervous, over-awed pussy cats. Because they were under pressure to deal with an awkward succession problem they decided to take a man with no retail experience at his own valuation.Note, in passing, that these same non-executives turned from pussy cats into sheep at Home Depot’s last and most notorious annual meeting when their imperial CEO told them not to attend the function that is supposed to be at the heart of board accountability to shareholders.A third myth is that it is worth paying a fancy price to be rid of a serial underperformer. Yes, the share price jumped on the announcement of Mr Nardelli’s departure. But a rewards-for-failure system sends very dangerous incentive signals. If CEOs know that they win regardless of performance, what does it do to their strategic judgment?We cannot know whether Home Depot’s controversial $6bn move into the lower margin building supplies business would have happened if the ex-GE man’s pay package had included penalties for failure. But if CEOs are highly rewarded for failure, it follows that they have a huge incentive to bet the corporate ranch.A final myth is that stock options have no cost. They do. It consists of the amount the company gives up by not selling the options to outside investors. Happily, accountancy is finally recognising this reality. Lucian Bebchuk and others at Harvard have shown that the cost has been very significant in relation to profits. Then there are wider costs, which include the demotivation of the workforce – something at which Mr Nardelli excelled.So what to do, to prevent so many CEOs being granted huge entrepreneurial rewards for bureaucratic performance, as at Home Depot? The American writer H.L. Mencken once said that for every problem there is a solution that is neat, plausible and wrong. Previous attempts to cap boardroom pay have proved his point, notably the move in the 1990s to legislate a ceiling on it, which prompted the explosive growth of stock options in the first place.The least bad solution, then, is to engage shareholders and give them a UK-style vote on CEO pay. Investor activism may help. It is surely no coincidence that Mr Nardelli left after Ralph Whitworth’s Relational Investors acquired an activist stake in Home Depot.We also need to recognise that pay consultants’ methodologies are still in the stone age, with heavy reliance on total shareholder return, which can reward people with stock market windfalls, and earnings per share, a malleable number to which Home Depot shifted when it suited its book. If we have to have such measurements, something closer to economic value added would make more sense.But what is wrong, cash-poor, high-tech companies apart, with fewer options, less equity and more cash? Good old fashioned pay – now there’s a thought.
409;HD;Home Depot;2007-01-04T01:23:27Z;Win-win situations for those at top;;"The $210m severance package awarded to Bob Nardelli, departing chief executive of Home Depot, ranks among the largest in corporate history.It also underscores an issue that continues to outrage shareholder groups: huge pay-offs to executives leaving underperforming companies.Home Depot shares fell about 8 per cent during Mr Nardelli’s watch, although the company on Wednesday pointed to earnings growth and increased market share under its outgoing chief.Mr Nardelli’s pay-out follows a package awarded last month to outgoing Pfizer chief executive Hank McKinnell valued at about $213m. Pfizer shares dropped nearly 40 per cent during Mr McKinnell’s five-year tenure.It also comes after Hewlett-Packard handed $42m in severance to Carly Fiorina last year after ousting her as chief executive following a run of poor performance.Phil Purcell received $44m on his departure from Morgan Stanley in 2005, after weak performance and a bruising leadership battle that crushed morale. Mr Purcell’s severance came on top of $62m in deferred compensation and pension benefits already accrued.Corporate governance experts say big severance payments such as Mr Nardelli’s are the result of ill-conceived employment contracts that guarantee senior executives a certain amount of compensation upon departure regardless of a group’s performance. In Mr Nardelli’s case, the $210m pay-out stems from a contract agreed in 2000.“We’ve known that this employment agreement contained oodles of guaranteed fixed income regardless of how well the company performed,” said Paul Hodgson, senior research associate at the Corporate Library.Mr Hodgson added that in spite of five years of outrage over compensation, large companies continue to offer “golden parachute” agreements that guarantee big pay-days regardless of corporate performance.He cited Boeing’s contract with chief executive W. James McNerney Jr and HP’s with chief executive Mark Hurd as two agreements with guaranteed pay-outs.He said pay-outs such as Mr Nardelli’s would not end “until boards sit down and say, ‘We will pay you and we will pay you a lot; but you have to earn it’”."

The bullish mood continued after a manufacturing survey proved to be stronger than expected and price pressures fell, reducing inflation fears.The Dow Jones Industrial Average set a new intra-day record high of 12,580.35 during morning trade, while technology shares boosted the Nasdaq Composite.Stocks then pared some of their gains ahead of the Fed’s December meeting minutes being released. Selling erupted when policy makers indicated their concerns over core inflation. “The market was set up for a bout of profit taking this week, it just required a catalyst,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.He expects choppy trading will continue until next week and then the focus will shift to fourth-quarter earnings results.At the close on Wednesday, the S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent, or 1.53 points, to 1,416.77.Industrials was the best performing main group in the index while the energy sector led losses.The Nasdaq Composite, led the leading averages, rising 1.6 per cent at one stage before it settled 0.3 per cent, or 7.87 points, firmer at 2,413.87. The Dow closed 0.1 per cent, or 11.37 points, higher at 12,474.52.Blue chip stocks with diversified operations are favoured as the sector of choice by many analysts this year as earnings are expected to slow.Earlier in the day, several heavyweight stocks that fell during 2006, such as Home Depot, Wal-Mart, Intel, and Yahoo, made a good start. Shares in Home Depot jumped to a high of $41.84, before they closed 0.9 per cent better at $41.07, after the home improvement chain said that Bob Nardelli, chairman and chief executive officer, was leaving the company.Wal-Mart noted sales grew above expectations during the holiday period and its shares gained 3 per cent to $47.55.In the tech sector, Intel had pared earlier gains and was up 0.5 per cent at $20.35, Cisco rose 1.5 per cent to $27.73, Dell Computer gained 1.6 per cent to $25.49 and Google was 1.5 per cent higher at $467.59.Verizon rose 1.6 per cent to $37.82. Some analysts expect tech and telecoms to perform well this year.“Telecom services and technology sectors appear to be neglected and we believe these are areas of opportunity for 2007,” noted Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.Goodyear Tire & Rubber shares jumped 8.6 per cent to $22.80 after an upgrade to “buy” from Deutsche. Workers have ended a three-month strike against the company’s plans to cut costs.Dragging on the Dow was Exxon Mobil, whose shares fell 3.3 per cent to $74.11 after a sharp fall in the price of oil.Shares in Amazon fell 1.9 per cent at $38.70 after Citigroup downgraded the web-based retailer to a “sell” from a “hold”.Home builders were weaker after Lennar said it expects to post a loss in the fourth quarter. Shares in Lennar fell 3.5 per cent to $50.63.Shares in General Motors were down 4.1 per cent at $29.45 while shares inFord were unchanged at $7.51 after the automakers released their sales numbers for December. GM said sales fell 9.6 per cent from a year earlier while Ford saw a drop of 13 per cent.
411;HD;Home Depot;2007-01-03T21:41:22Z;Taking customer care to the extreme;;As the year comes to an end, Chuck Prince, the much-maligned chief executive of Citigroup, should be feeling a bit better about life, thanks to a 10 per cent jump in the share price over the past two weeks.Some of Citigroup’s customers should also be feeling more appreciated. Prince has been on a big customer service push and has been known to take calls from unhappy account holders himself.But it all seems to be getting a bit out of hand over at Citi Cards. Observer recently popped round to see the affable boss, Vik Atal, in his eyrie at the top of the Long Island City tower.Halfway through the chat, Atal’s assistant comes in to say he has an important call.“Customers come first,” he explains when he returns. Who was the customer? Home Depot? Sears?“No, just an ordinary cardholder.” Ten minutes later, his assistant comes in again.“It’s Mrs Johnson,” she says, in the hushed tone usually reserved for calls from the White House.On his return, Observer asked what Mrs Johnson wanted. “She wanted to know how many air miles she had on her account.”So, if you are one of Atal’s 90m customers and have a problem, just give him a ring.His number is ... no, on second thoughts, give him a break. It is the holidays, after all.Spitzer’s moveMore than a few on Wall Street were happy to see Eliot Spitzer exit his position as New York’s attorney-general at the New Year. While he hasn’t exactly given up power by being elected governor of the state, at least he will be out of their neighbourhood.While he was attorney-general, Spitzer worked in Lower Manhattan and, standing in his 25th floor office, one could not avoid the feeling that he was literally scanning the streets below, looking for wrong-doers in the financial district.Now that he is governor, Spitzer – who made his name by launching investigations into the big Wall Street banks, mutual funds and insurance companies – must adjust to a new neighbourhood. He and his family will live in the governor’s mansion in sleepy Albany, 160 miles from Manhattan, where he grew up.Albany has nothing like Manhattan’s Central Park, where Spitzer has enjoyed daily early-morning runs. But that does not mean there won’t be plenty for the restless Spitzer to do.He is, after all, taking on one of the most dysfunctional state governments in the US. Large swaths of the upstate region of New York are economically depressed. Spitzer may soon find that rooting out unethical behaviour in corporate America was the easier task.Saved for PhillyPhilidelphians, rejoice. The city has rallied to the cause and will keep a painting by its native son, Thomas Eakins, which was about to be spirited away by Wal-Mart heir Alice Walton to her new American art museum in Arkansas. Walton paid $68m for the 1875 painting “The Gross Clinic”, which features Philadelphia native – and surgeon – Samuel Gross performing bone surgery.An outcry followed news of the recent sale by Philadelphia’s Jefferson University and the citizens of the city were given until December 26 to match the offer and keep the painting in Philadelphia. Just days before deadline, the fund-raising committee had collected $30m, it reported, with 2,000 donors from across the country chipping in. Not enough, but the Eakins will stay, because Wachovia Corp, playing good fairy, kicked in a line of credit to cover the balance.Red, white, through?Recent visitors to JPMorgan Chase world headquarters at 270 Park Avenue may have noticed a significant cosmetic change. The giant American flag that once dominated the building’s cavernous entrance hall has quietly migrated to a much less prominent position on a south-facing lobby wall, tucked away next to the escalators.So has the House of Morgan lost its patriotic fervour? Hardly. Sources at the bank say the big flag, which went up after the September 11 2001 terrorists attacks, was always meant to be temporary. But as the months turned to years, it never went away.Aesthetic critics found its dominating size unattractive. Branding specialists thought it a bit unwise to festoon the lobby of a would-be global bank with an in-your-face piece of American symbolism.The flag debate finally bubbled up to chief executive Jamie Dimon, who had already made another significant redecorating decision. Among his first moves as chief executive was to have a Starbucks installed on the lobby’s second floor, allowing the troops to fuel up without leaving the building.The decision finally came down a few weeks back to slide the flag around the corner. No word yet on whether this is Old Glory’s first stop on the way out the door.
412;HD;Home Depot;2007-01-03T20:53:50Z;Home Depot;;Unlike mere mortals, chief executives rarely doubt their own worth. Even by peer group standards, however, Bob Nardelli has long been in a pay grade of his own. That makes the $210m severance package the beleaguered boss of Home Depot has received for his exit no less grating.During his six-year tenure at Home Depot, Mr Nardelli has overseen heavy investments, many of which have yet to deliver tangible returns, a loss of the home retailer’s entrepreneurial edge and a languishing share price. It would be unfair to blame Mr Nardelli for all the shares’ underperformance, compared, say, with arch-rival Lowe’s. Investors who paid more than 40 times Home Depot’s earnings in late 2000 were expecting too much from what was already a fairly mature retail business.However, Home Depot was also a prime beneficiary of the ensuing boom in US housing. It remains far from clear how much of the expansion in profits and revenues Mr Nardelli likes to cite will prove sustainable.That could make life hard for his successor. Like Mr Nardelli and much of the remaining management team, Frank Blake brings fairly modest retail experience to the task. At least he should be able to avoid further PR disasters, such as Home Depot’s botched 2006 shareholder meeting. Managerial change, moreover, could make Home Depot a more tempting target for private equity buyers attracted to its real estate portfolio.The bigger message, though, is that outlandish compensation can ultimately cost executives their jobs. Mr Nardelli’s staggering remuneration packages incited Home Depot shareholders’ wrath. The episode should remind investors to scrutinise such deals in the future.By taking his full entitlement, Mr Nardelli may have done a final unintended service to the cause of reining in excessive pay for managerial failures.
413;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Company failed to quell shareholder anger;;Bob Nardelli’s resignation from Home Depot highlights the company’s failure properly to manage shareholder dissatisfaction in an era of increased activism in corporate America.For most of 2006, the retailer was on the defensive as a number of investors publicly stated their opposition to the hefty pay rises awarded to Mr Nardelli despite a slump in the company’s performance. Shareholders have also been sceptical of Home Depot’s strategy to expand internationally and beyond retailing.That criticism reached a first boiling point in May, when no board members except Mr Nardelli attended the company’s annual meeting. To make matters worse, the AGM only lasted 35 minutes as Mr Nardelli refused to answer any questions.Many investors believed Home Depot was deliberately stonewalling them, and 30 per cent of shareholders withheld their vote for the company’s directors.Over following months, Mr Nardelli made an attempt to win back support from shareholders in meetings in the US, Canada, and Mexico during which he explained the company’s strategy and listened to investor concerns. But the pressure did not wane, even after September when Home Depot’s compensation committee began a review of its executive compensation policies.Last month, it became clear that a proxy battle was in store. Ralph Whitworth, head of Relational Investors, a San Diego-based hedge fund which campaigned for change at Sovereign Bancorp in 2006, said Home Depot was suffering from “chronic underperformance” and “deficient strategy”.Mr Nardelli’s departure may not be enough to satisfy unhappy Home Depot shareholders, including Mr Whitworth.

As oil nudged $80 a barrel and the Fed was seemingly set for further rate hikes, the S&P 500 index was down 2 per cent from the start of the year, while the Nasdaq Composite was
8 per cent lower.“The year really came down to how you reacted once the market made its lows in July,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading. “If you thought the Federal Reserve still had room to tighten policy you lost. Investors who bet the Fed was done, were winners.”The subsequent rally in shares as oil prices receded propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average into record territory and the S&P back to levels not seen since late 2000. Stocks also benefited from lower long-term interest rates, better than expected third-quarter earnings of 19 per cent and a record $176,000bn in merger and acquisition activity.Still, 2006 contained its share of good and bad stock selections. “Every year is the the year of the stock picker,” said Stuart Schweitzer, a global fund manager at JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management.As the year ebbed on Friday, the Dow had gained 16.3 per cent to 12,463.15. That was just shy of its record close of 12,510.57 and its intra-day record high of 12,529.88 set this week.The S&P had gained 13.6 per cent to 1,418.30 this year. All 10 big industry groups in the S&P rose by at least 5 per cent, led by a 32.1 per cent rise in the telecommunications sub-index. Energy followed with a rise of 22.2 per cent, but healthcare and information technology lagged behind with gains of 5.8 and 7.7 per cent respectively. The Nasdaq had risen 9.5 per cent to 2,415.29 for the year at the close of trading on Friday. Some big tech names such as Yahoo, down 34.8 per cent at $25.54 and Ebay, off 30.4 per cent at $30.07, endured a tough year.Leading the pack was the Russell 2000 index of small capitalised companies with a return of 17 per cent.General Motors led the Dow’s charge off its mid-year low of 10,706.14. In spite of facing significant hurdles in restructuring its car operations, its stock rallied 58.2 per cent to $30.72, and set a high of $36.56 in October.That performance paled however, when compared with Allegheny as the manufacturer of stainless steel and titanium rose 151.3 per cent to $90.68 for the year. The laggard in the Dow was Intel. The chipmaker fell 18.9 per cent this year to $20.25, as it endured falling revenues and market share amid a price war with rival chipmaker, AMD, whose stock slumped 33.5 per cent to $20.35 this year. The Philadelphia stock exchange semiconductor index fell 2.4 per cent this year.Other Dow stocks ending the year in negative territory were Home Depot, down 0.8 per cent at $40.16 and Wal-Mart, off 1.3 per cent at $46.18.Boosting the Dow were Hewlett-Packard, up 44 per cent at $41.19, and Disney, 43 per cent higher at $34.27.AT&T, rose 46 per cent to $35.75, and the telecom company led the surge in merger activity with its purchase of BellSouth. The value of the deal has risen from $67bn to about $84bn and is pending approval from regulators. BellSouth has risen 74 per cent to $47.11.Another big deal was Freeport McMoRan’s $25.9bn purchase of Phelps Dodge that would create the world’s largest copper miner. Shares in Phelps jumped 66.4 per cent to $119.17 for the year.While 16 of the Dow’s 30 members failed to beat the overall market’s rise in 2006, Citigroup, with a gain of 14.8 per cent to $55.70, made a valiant effort late in the year, jumping 12.3 per cent in December as investors chased a year-end rally.A record year in earnings for investment banks was reflected in a 56 per cent rise in Goldman Sachs to $199.35.Search engine Google soared above $500 during the year and had rallied 11 per cent to $460.48 on Friday.One of the biggest companies caught in the backdated options morass was Apple.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture).

416;HD;Home Depot;2006-12-19T19:33:23Z;LBO activity aids investor protection;;Leveraged buy-out activity not only drove record high-yield bond issuance this year, it also had a tangible impact on the investment-grade market.As corporate management teams have become more responsive to activist shareholders and private equity firms, buyers of US high-grade bonds have been increasingly demanding covenant protections – contract terms that protect bondholders against excessive corporate leveraging, which are common in Europe. According to recent research from Bear Stearns, investors find these protections so valuable that they are willing to accept 15-25 basis points less in coupons for bonds with additional covenants.“The market is apparently placing a higher price on event risk protection in Black & Decker, CRH America, Federated, Mohawk Industries, Temple Inland, Tyson Foods and Universal Health,” says Victor Consoli, credit strategist at Bear Stearns.Increasing numbers of issuers are responding, with the inclusion of change of control puts – which force the company to buy back debt at full value if there is a takeover – and coupon step-ups – which force a company to pay more interest on the debt if there is a deterioration in creditworthiness.Home Depot, the A-rated home improvement retailer, which last month was the subject of takeover rumours, is the latest company to include a change-of-control clause in the bond indentures for its $5bn bond financing, priced last week.The change of control option would force the company to pay bondholders 101 per cent of the bond’s face value if a buy-out results in the company’s downgrade to junk status.“For an $86bn market-cap company [this] is a true sign of the times,” says Mr Consoli.In the past, investment-grade bonds in the US have rarely had any covenants to protect the bondholder against, for example, a management team seeking to boost its share price with big stock repurchases.As investors in the covenant-light bonds of HCA, the hospital operator recently discovered, a management team that embarks on the LBO trail can be disastrous. HCA’s buy-out caused the company’s benchmark 10-year bonds to lose 20 per cent of their value.Just as LBO activity has shown equity investors the value of leverage, analysts say, bondholders are using covenants to steel themselves for more equity friendly activity from corporate management. Home Depot’s recent bond deal, for example, was used to fund stock buy-backs – just the latest in a string of such deals this year.As one head of debt syndicate says: “Either you’re going to buy back your stock, or someone else is.”
417;HD;Home Depot;2006-12-18T22:52:17Z;Activist investor ups Home Depot stake;;Ralph Whitworth, the activist investor, has amassed a stake in Home Depot and accused the second largest retailer in the US of “chronic” underperformance and “deficient strategy”.Mr Whitworth, whose firm Relational Investors this year waged a battle against Sovereign and took a seat on the board of the Pennsylvania-based bank, said he wants Home Depot to form a special committee of directors to evaluate the company’s direction.Mr Whitworth also said he might nominate one or more members to the board, and requested a meeting with Bob Nardelli, Home Depot’s chief executive.The challenge from Relational will add to Home Depot’s woes, including falling profits caused by the slowdown in the housing market and criticism over the company’s corporate governance practices, which have focused on Mr Nardelli’s pay and the granting of stock options. Last month, Mr Nardelli was forced to quash speculation that Home Depot would be taken over by private equity groups.In a letter to Mr Nardelli, Mr Whitworth wrote: “We believe the company’s board of directors is presented with enormous responsibility and opportunity to reverse the company’s chronic inferior stock price performance experienced since 2000. We attribute this performance to deficient strategy, operations, capital allocation and governance.”Mr Whitworth could face significant difficulties in mounting a campaign against Home Depot. Chief among them Relational will have to build support for its position well beyond its small holding of 0.6 per cent, which is worth $488m. Although activist investors have successfully campaigned against big US companies recently, the largest targets have proved elusive. Activist Nelson Peltz secured many concessions from HJ Heinz, the US food company worth $15bn in market capitalisation, but Carl Icahn struggled to achieve most of what he aimed for in his battle with Time Warner, the $87bn media conglomerate.Home Depot responded to Relational’s attack by rejecting the proposal to form a special committee of directors on the ground that the company has just recently completed a strategic review. However, Home Depot said it would seek to arrange a meeting with Mr Whitworth in 2007.Although Home Depot’s shares have fallen slightly this year, the company insisted that sales and earnings have grown steadily since 2001 and it has returned more than $20bn to shareholders in dividends and buy-backs.Home Depot shares rose on Monday 0.2 per cent to $39.98.
418;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Alternative reality;;A $100bn leveraged buy-out no longer seems unthinkable. But what about a $100bn exit?The co-founder of Carlyle, a private equity group, predicts an LBO that size within two years. Vivendi had talks about a deal more than half that scale. Home Depot had to deny it was a target. With an enterprise value of about $89bn, adding a premium would have got close to the magic number.There are less than 60 non-financial public companies worldwide of that size. But if things fell into place, it is feasible that private equity groups could find, say, $25bn of equity. Piling on $75bn-plus of debt would be tough, but not unimaginable in today’s extraordinarily generous markets.Yet private equity investors have to cash out of deals, too. A conglomerate such as Vivendi could be broken up. That would not, however, make sense for a company such as Home Depot. A $100bn trade sale would be virtually impossible. And while some financial engineering might be achievable, borrowing more – one way for private equity to claw back a big chunk of money early – could be a challenge with already stretched lenders and the risk of tougher market conditions.Private equity might be able to make the business look better. Even so, an initial public offering exit would risk triggering indigestion. The most a US company has raised is the $11bn by AT&T Wireless at the end of the 2000 equity frenzy. Any IPO of a company with $60bn-plus in equity value would have to approach that, given the need for a 15-20 per cent float. Even then, a complete, staged exit from the remaining stake could take longer than private equity likes.The ability of debt markets to swallow higher valuations than public equity markets might make a 12-figure LBO possible. But unless their appetite for IPOs shifts dramatically, those same, more cautious, stock markets could block the exit.
419;HD;Home Depot;2006-12-15T16:25:14Z;Housing slowdown hits Black & Decker;;Black & Decker warned on Friday that the weakening US housing market would cut sales of its power tools in the current quarter, and said it faced “significant challenges” in the first half of next year which were likely to be felt by rivals.The US group is the global market leader and sells a third of its power tools and accessories through Home Depot and Lowe’s, which have both warned that falling new and existing home sales would hit revenues.Retailers have responded by reducing inventories, while Black & Decker said it had also lost sales by not matching the deep discounting of some rivals in favour of maintaining its premium pricing, and continuing increases to pass on rising raw material costs.Black & Decker’s warning – which saw it cut its earnings forecast for the third time this year – is the latest evidence of how the housing slowdown is affecting corporate America.Companies such as Caterpillar, which also have substantial exposure to the US residential construction market, have cautioned that the boom in sales seen over the past three years is likely to end in 2007.The eponymous B&W brand is aimed mainly at retail customers and accounts for a third of power tool sales, but the bulk of the slowdown since October was in its larger industrial business through marques such as Dewalt.“The one silver lining in this dark quarter…is that we continue to generate substantial cash flow,” Nolan Archibald, chairman and chief executive, told analysts.Mr Archibald said the company would continue to explore further share repurchases and bolt-on acquisitions, having bought Vector earlier this year to add to Porter-Cable/Delta and Baldwin/Weiser deals completed over the past two years.Black & Decker declined to provide guidance for 2007, but cut its earnings forecast for the December quarter from $1.85-$1.90 a share to $1.30-$1.35.The shares fell more than 8 per cent to $79.11 in early New York trading, though rivals such as Masco were broadly unchanged.Mr Archibald said sales of power tools and accessories – which account for a quarter of group revenues – would be down by double-digit percentage levels in the current quarter, with other divisions such as hardware and fasteners expected to report slower drops in sales.
420;HD;Home Depot;2006-12-13T18:38:48Z;Home Depot to pursue acquisitions in China;;Home Depot, America’s second-largest retailer, said it could make more acquisitions in China following its agreement on Wednesday to buy HomeWay, one of China’s biggest do-it-yourself chains.Annette Verschuren, president of Home Depot’s Asian operations, said the company would pursue a similar strategy to the one adopted in Mexico, where an initial acquisition in 2001 was followed by two further deals.“We will grow organically and inorganically as we did in Mexico,” she said, in an interview.Home Depot’s takeover of HomeWay, reported in the Financial Times earlier this week, marks the company’s entry into China after more than two years of planning and protracted negotiations. Financial details were not disclosed but the deal, which gives Home Depot 100 per cent control of the company, is believed to be worth about $100m.Also on Wednesday, GE Aviation signed a $550m agreement with Shanghai Airlines – including $300m worth of aircraft engines for nine Boeing 787-Dreamliners and $250m worth of related service costs.The deals, made public at a ceremony in Beijing attended by Carlos Gutierrez, the US commerce secretary, show how the strengthening spending power of the Chinese middle-class is fuelling growth in sectors such as home improvement and travel.China’s home improvement market is already one of the biggest in the world, currently valued at nearly $50bn and growing by up to a fifth annually.Tianjin-based HomeWay commanded 4.4 per cent of the market last year, making it the fourth-largest DIY chain in China, with 12 stores and some 3,000 employees across six cities.Home Depot’s other acquisition targets could include Orient Home, the number two DIY chain, which held talks with the US group earlier this year without reaching agreement.Asked about the possibility of a deal with Orient, Ms Verschuren said: “Anything is possible.”Home Depot’s biggest competitor in China will be UK-based B&Q, part of Kingfisher, Europe’s largest DIY retailer, which has more than 50 stores and nearly 20 per cent of the market.The US retailer hopes that China will become a strong source of fresh growth as its maturing domestic business slows. The company’s international presence has been limited to Mexico and Canada since a failed expansion into South America in the 1990s.The Chinese market differs from the suburban-dominated US, with most Chinese DIY shoppers looking to re-model or decorate small urban apartments. Home Depot’s Chinese stores will stock products aimed at local buyers as well as known American-style furnishings.

The central bank is expected to keep its fed funds rate steady at 5.25 per cent.Investors are pondering whether the market has enough impetus for a traditional year end rally. At this stage, stocks have already rallied sharply from their lows of June.“Seasonally, this is the time people should be bullish and we continue to expect a bias to the upside before the end of the year,” said Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at JP Morgan Asset & Wealth Management.Renewed deal activity boosted stock index futures early on Monday, and less than an hour before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures were up 2 points at 1424.2, above fair value of 1421.93. Meanwhile Nasdaq futures were up 1 point at 1809, trading just under fair value at 1809.27.Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 18 points at 12,414.In deal news, Citigroup has reportedly made a bid for Prudential plc’s Egg Internet banking arm.Home Depot plans to spend $100m in buying a majority stake in China’s HomeWay.There are also reports that Sabre Holdings, owner of the Travelocity web site, will accept a private buy out offer in the region of $4bn.Last week, stocks closed modestly firmer on Friday, after the November employment report revealed the creation of 132,000 jobs last month. The S&P gained 0.2 per cent to 1,409.84, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 2,437.36. The Dow rallied 0.2 per cent to settle at 12,307.49.The data flow tracking group, Emerging Portfolio Fund Research said “US equities had their worst week of the year - at the start of December - with net redemptions exceeding $6.3bn.” EPFR said “investors pulled money primarily out of passively managed funds,” and that “small cap equity funds fared worse than mid-, and large cap equity funds, a trend that has persisted throughout the fourth quarter of 2006.”

Economists expect the report to show that 110,000 jobs were created last month.“It’s a big number and has the potential to push the market around,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards. “A consensus number would not spark much movement.

convertible bonds, increased to $4.5bn from $3bn. Shares in the carmaker fell 2.7 per cent to $7.16. Its shares have tumbled 10.9 per cent this week as the bonds could become equity at some stage in the future and thus dilute shareholder value.News Corp shares rose
3 per cent to $22.40, while Liberty Media was 2.7 per cent firmer at $90.28 on news that News Corp will shortly exchange a stake in DirecTV for a parcel of News Corp shares that Liberty holds.Shares in Fannie Mae gained 1.9 per cent to $59.61 after the mortgage giant said that it had overstated its earnings by $7.9bn for 2002 to 2004 – less than earlier estimates of almost $11bn. The company increased its dividend to 40 cents.In other accounting news, Home Depot said its review of stock option grants had revealed an unrecorded expense of $200m.

423;HD;Home Depot;2006-12-02T01:00:46Z;Home Depot quashes buy-out rumours;;Home Depot, the second-biggest US retailer, has sought to quash speculation about a record $100bn leveraged buy-out of the company, insisting it has had no talks about such a deal.In a statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bob Nardelli, chairman and chief executive, said Home Depot’s board of directors remained committed to its current strategy.“The company has had no discussion about a potential leveraged buy-out or recapitalisation,” he said.Mr Nardelli’s comments followed reports that two private equity groups – Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co and Texas Pacific – were exploring a $100bn buy-out of the home improvement retailer.Such a deal would be more than twice the size of the largest private equity deal in history: last month’s $36bn takeover of Equity Office Properties, the commercial real estate empire founded by Chicago tycoon Sam Zell, by Blackstone.Buy-out speculation has swirled around Home Depot for weeks following a slump in its shares as home improvement sales have been hit by the slowdown in the US housing market.The fact that the rumours have been taken seriously underlines the growing power and ambition of private equity companies following a series of large buy-outs this year.Home Depot has a market capitalisation of $80bn, is nearly $3bn in debt, and any buyer would probably need to pay a substantial premium to secure a deal. To many on Wall Street, a deal of such magnitude is simply beyond reach. Assuming the private equity buyers will pay about 30 per cent in equity, the investment banks would have to assemble a debt financing package in excess of $60bn. This is far higher than what most observers believe to be the limit in terms of investor demand, even considering today’s abundant liquidity.Nevertheless, the record set by EOP is expected to be shattered in the coming months, with the definition of a mega buy-out shifting from deal sizes between $10bn and $25bn to somewhere above that level.Recently, Vivendi, the French media group, disclosed an approach from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts worth some €50bn ($66bn).In the US, there has been speculation that Sprint, the wireless carrier, could be a potential buy-out target.

A 2.9 per cent increase in November has extended gains in the Russell 2000 index of small capitalised stocks to 15.7 per cent for the year.The Dow lagged behind last month, rising just 1.2 per cent, for a rise of 13.8 per cent this year. The S&P is up 11.9 per cent, while the Nasdaq trails, up 9.4 per cent.Stocks were hit this week by mixed economic data. A contraction in several manufacturing surveys and no ebb in some measures of inflation could prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting rates should activity soften further.“The market has concerns about inflation and the risk of a recession” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “We seem to be walking a fine line between a hard and a soft landing.”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent lower at 1,396.72, and down 0.3 per cent for the week. The Nasdaq was 0.8 per cent lower at 2,413.21, a fall of 1.9 per cent for the week. The Dow was 0.2 per cent weaker at 12,194.13, a slide of 0.7 per cent for the week.

The largest retailer in the US helped spark a big sell-off in stocks on Monday, when it said sales fell 0.1 per cent in November, its first drop since 1996.The company later said it expected sales in December to rise by no more than 1 per cent. Its shares fell 4.2 per cent for the week to $45.87.Other retailers with disappointing sales numbers slid, led by JC Penney, down 5.5 per cent to $76.33, and wholesale retailer, Costco, down 2.4 per cent at $52.20.Federated Department stores slid 5.8 per cent to $40.60, in spite of reporting better sales.No major deals were announced this week but talk of a $100bn buy-out shrouded Home Depot on Friday and its shares briefly jumped 5.2 per cent. They were 2.6 per cent higher for the week at $38.97. Communications chip maker, Broadcom announced plans to buy privately held LVL7 Systems Inc for $62m in cash. Its shares slid 8.4 per cent to $32.84.The Philadelphia semiconductor index was 3.2 per cent lower for the week.The energy sector did well this week, as oil prices hit a two-month high before sliding a touch on Friday.The Energy Select Sector SPDR, an exchange-traded fund, hit an all-time high of $60.83 on Thursday and was 5.5 per cent firmer at $60.72 for the week.“Don’t count your oil wells before they gush, but this is potentially a big upside breakout,” said CynerTrader’s Mr Tower.

425;HD;Home Depot;2006-11-27T19:06:33Z;Indian retailers keep eye on foreign rivals;;India’s leading retail groups have recently been busy bolstering their operations as large foreign players look for opportunities in the country.Last month Reliance Industries, India’s largest private sector company, launched grocery chain Reliance Fresh in what is expected to be a $5.5bn investment.Stores are positioned near to farms that provide fresh produce to the outlets. The group’s “agro-retail strategy” is unprecedented in concept and scale in a country where consumers have traditionally gone to the market or corner stores to buy their groceries. Formal stores, or “organised retail”, accounts for only 2-3 per cent of the country’s $250bn-$300bn retail industry.Meanwhile, Pantaloon, India’s leading retailer, has announced plans to invest $1bn to expand its retail space nearly eightfold by 2010 and add more store brands as demand grows.The owner of department stores such as Central, Big Bazaar and Food Bazaar is preparing to launch a furniture and home decoration brand “resembling Home Depot and Ikea put together”, according to Kishore Biyani, managing director of Pantaloon.Pantaloon is broadening its portfolio of store brands to include home furnishings, white goods and food.Also, Hindustan Lever, Unilever’s business in India, has launched new consultancy services to overhaul store layout, decoration, product arrangement and staff training. In return, stores prominently promote Hindustan Lever products, such as Lux soap, Knorr soups and Red Label tea.Hindustan Lever last month extended its consultancy to help transform India’s mom-and-pop shops into “self-service stores”, in contrast to conventional general stores where goods are kept behind counters.However, in spite of the foreign interest in India’s retail sector, Mr Biyani downplayed the threat, saying Pantaloon’s ambitious scale-up was more in response to demand from Indian consumers rather than stiffening competition.“Not more than 2 per cent of the population would know Wal-Mart as a brand,” said Mr Biyani. “[India] is never an easy entry. Anyone would have to come here and build up their brand.”
426;HD;Home Depot;2006-11-17T21:43:23Z;ISS presses for tougher line on boardroom votes;;US companies will come under renewed pressure to give shareholders more power on governance issues such as board independence and executive compensation under tougher voting guidelines from a leading investor advisory firm.The release of the guidelines by Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises 1,700 institutional investors on votes at annual shareholder meetings, is a sign of fund managers’ desire to have more say on corporate matters.This trend has been strengthened by a series of scandals, such as the controversy over options back-dating, that have prompted an increasing number of shareholders to move away from their traditional passive acceptance of management’s decisions.“We have seen a tectonic shift in power away from the corner office towards shareholders and directors,” said Martha Carter, ISS managing director of corporate governance.In the new guidelines, released yesterday, ISS urges shareholders to support the introduction of majority voting for directors and to pressure companies to force the resignation of directors that fail to win the support of the majority of shareholders.Corporate governance activists regard the change as crucial for the advancement of shareholder democracy, arguing that it allows investors to hold directors accountable for their performance. Some 100 US companies, including Wal-Mart and McDonald’s, have already announced they will elect directors by majority voting at their next annual meeting.However, the issue re-mains a top priority for investors, who tabled resolutions calling for the change in the voting rules at more than 150 companies during the last round of annual meetings, according to ISS.The advisory firm tightened its guidelines on directors’ performance, urging shareholders not to vote for directors of companies that significantly underperform their sector in both financial and share price terms for two years in a row.On another controversial issue – executive pay – ISS recommends that investors withhold their vote from the chief executive, or even the entire board, of companies with “egregious compensation problems”.Last year, the advisory firm urged investors to withdraw support only for directors sitting on the compensation committee.The tougher stance follows a string of shareholder protests at the pay of senior executives at companies such as Pfizer, AT&T, Merrill Lynch and Home Depot.In its list of bad compensation practices, ISS includes awarding executives change-in-control payments when their company is bought but they remain at the helm.The issue has become increasingly controversial due to the sharp rise in takeovers by private equity groups, which often retain companies’ top management.
427;HD;Home Depot;2006-11-15T00:28:19Z;US economy hit by housing slowdown;;"A slew of economic reports on Tuesday showed the US economy feeling the strain from the sharp slowdown in the housing sector, while offering hopes that inflation pressures could be easing.The US data came as Japan announced a stronger-than-expected 2 per cent annualised growth rate for the third quarter, raising the prospect of a second interest rate rise there.The latest US retail sales figures, from October, showed that consumer spending remained resilient in spite of the pressures from the housing market. Sales excluding petrol increased by 0.4 per cent over the month. Lower oil prices meant the value of total retail spending fell 0.2 per cent on the previous month.But downward revisions to the previous two months’ retail sales suggested that consumer spending was weaker than thought.Drew Matus, a senior economist at Lehman Brothers, said: “The retail picture points to a slightly lower growth profile than we anticipated.”Reports from Home Depot, the world’s biggest DIY retailer, and D.R. Horton, the second-biggest US home builder, showed that pain continues in sectors most directly exposed to the housing slowdown.Home Depot, which reported a 3 per cent fall in third-quarter net earnings, said the slowdown had come “faster and deeper” than expected. Bob Nardelli, chief executive, said the softening in the housing market had caused “significant” deterioration in home improvement sales, with conditions likely to worsen.D.R. Horton, meanwhile, reported a rise in cancellations of new home sales for the third quarter in a row. “I’d say we are in the early stages of a downturn,” said Don Tomnitz, president and chief executive.The US inflation picture improved moderately, as data showed core producer prices fell last month at their sharpest rate in 13 years. Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America Securities, said the fall in core PPI – excluding food and energy – was “almost entirely the result of lower car and truck prices”.Bond prices rallied on hopes that tomorrow’s consumer price report would show evidence that this reduction would feed into slightly lower consumer price inflation. US stocks also closed higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a record 12,218.01.The much stronger than expected growth in Japan sent the Nikkei stock average up 1.67 per cent to 16,290, its biggest percentage gain in six weeks.Additional reporting by Andrew Ward in Atlanta and Doug

428;HD;Home Depot;2006-11-14T21:36:09Z;Wall Street shrugs aside profit takers;;US stocks rebounded from early weakness on Tuesday, as investors digested corporate earnings reports, and viewed sharply lower wholesale inflation and mixed retail sales data as elements heralding a soft landing for the economy.Opening gains in the indices were surrendered and consolidation loomed, only for buyers to emerge during afternoon trade. As buying picked up, the S&P 500 broke through a key barrier at 1389, and closed near a six year high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average pierced a key trading level at 12,190, and rallied further to a new record close.Stocks also took some heart after William Poole, president of the St Louis Federal Reserve, said inflation expectations are “well controlled” and that the central bank’s current policy stance is “about right.”Typifying the spirit of the day was Home Depot, which initially fell 1.7 per cent to a low of $35.77, as it blamed a “very challenging housing environment” for a third-quarter profit of 73 cents a share, below estimates of 75 cents a share. But despite its lowered guidance, shares rallied and closed up $1.56, or 4.3 per cent at $37.96.“The bulls came back after some profit taking. This has been the story for the past few months and is the type of day that postpones the idea the market is poised to take a break,” said Ken Tower, senior market strategist at CyberTrader, a division of Charles Schwab.The market was also led higher by Intel, up 88 cents, or 4.2 per cent at $21.88 and Wal-Mart, up $1.34, or 2.9 per cent at $47.66. The US’s largest retailer hit a peak of $48.20, after reporting earnings of 63 cents a share in the third quarter, at the top end of the company’s guidance provided last month. That beat the consensus estimate of 60 cents per share and analysts said lower guidance by the company was not as bad as feared.Among fallers was Agilent, down 5.7 per cent at $33. Agilent, which makes measuring technology, posted fourth-quarter net income of 36 cents a share, short of a forecast of 54 cents.Excessive pessimism over homebuilder DR Horton was abruptly punctured after its earnings of 88 cents per share comfortably beat estimates of only 69 cents. The company’s shares leapt 9.5 per cent to $24.50.The discount retailer Target earned $506m, or 59 cents a share, in the third quarter, up from $435m, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. The results exceeded the consensus forecast of 55 cents a share, and sent the company’s stock 2.4 per cent higher to $59.16.The S&P 500 finished up 8.8 points, or 0.6 per cent, at 1,393.22 and the Nasdaq Composite was 24.28 points, or 1 per cent higher, at 2,430.66. The Dow rose 86.13 points, or 0.7 per cent to 12,218.01.Retailer Saks reported net income of $6.18m, or 5 cents a share, for the fiscal third quarter, beating estimates of 3 cents a share. Shares in the company rose 2.6 per cent to $20.40 having been more than $24 earlier in the session.Shares in Staples fell 0.9 per cent to $25.83 as earnings of 36 cents a share, just pipping estimates of 35 cents.Still, some analysts believe stocks could be due for a period of consolidation after a run of solid gains that has sent the S&P 500 index towards a six-year high, buoyed by solid earnings.“The market has been brought a long way over the past 14 weeks and we now require a compelling signal to spark further gains,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market is not capped, it just looks like we will see a period of consolidation in November.”Stock index futures were indicating a bright start in early trade and then pushed higher after retail sales and wholesale inflation reports for October arrived.Headline retail sales fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2%, less than the projected fall of 0.4 per cent, while sales for September were revised lower to a decline of 0.8 per cent, versus an original drop of 0.4 per cent.Excluding automobile sales, the data revealed that sales fell 0.4 per cent, more than the projected decline of 0.3 per cent.But, stripping out petrol sales, overall sales rose 0.4 per cent, a figure that shows the consumer is still spending say economists.“The main story on retail sales was the sharp revisions to the September data, while the October was fairly close to expectations,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. “The market is apt to still take away a view that the consumer has been restrained in spending the income that had been going to gas when gas prices were higher.”Meanwhile investors were soothed by the inflation picture at the wholesale level. The producer price index fell 1.6 per cent last month versus the expected decline of 0.5 per cent. Excluding food and energy, the core rate fell 0.9 per cent, again well under the expected rise of 0.1 per cent. The core rate rose 0.6 per cent during September and last month’s fall was the largest since August 1993. The core PPI has fallen in four of the past five months.Investors now await the consumer price index for September due on Thursday.Lou Crandall, economist at Wrightson ICAP noted the “report doesn’t change our forecast of a 0.2 per cent increase in the core CPI.” Still he concedes “the fact that PPI food prices surprised us on the downside (-0.8 per cent) does shift the risk in the overall CPI.”
429;HD;Home Depot;2006-11-14T19:08:43Z;US retailers;;Last week, Wal-Mart announced that it would once again greet customers with “Merry Christmas” this year, rather than the “Happy Holidays” that offended some of America’s religious right. Unfortunately, neither sounds like a probable description of the retail giant’s own performance in the coming festive season.Admittedly, its latest subdued earnings forecast is broadly in line with increasingly gloomy expectations on Wall Street. There are positives. The growth in Wal-Mart’s gross margins compared to last year suggests that some of its historic strengths remain intact, notably in managing its supply chain and swiftly turning over inventory.The trouble is that to regain market share, Wal-Mart has little choice but to pass on the benefits of cheaper sourcing to customers. It is sounding increasingly belligerent on prices, even as other costs continue to rise. Third quarter operating costs – including wages and administrative expenses – rose more than 16 per cent year on year, well above revenue growth. There is little evidence as yet that lower energy costs are starting to have a positive effect.Unlike many of Wal-Mart’s recent missteps – from missing out on fashion trends in clothing to the awkward timing of its store revamps – the increase in compensation or utility costs are not company specific. Arch-rival Target, which for now continues to show far healthier same- store growth, also experienced a sharp rise in operating expenses as a share of revenues.Cost pressures are proving especially painful for retailers heavily exposed to the housing market, such as Home Depot, which saw same-store sales decline 5.1 per cent. But a combination of top-line pressures because of price competition and inflation in operating expenses could well prove the key to dissecting this year’s fourth quarter results. That suggests the need for caution, even when it comes to chronic share price underperformers such as Wal-Mart.
430;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;DR Horton sees rising cancellations;;The largest US housebuilders do not expect the market to recover until early 2008, with Home Depot on Tuesday adding its voice to concerns that the slowdown is impacting consumer behaviour.DR Horton, the second-largest US builder by sales, reported a rise in cancellations for the third quarter in a row and reiterated the industry view that it will take a prolonged period to rebuild confidence among buyers and sell excess supply.“I’d say we are in the early stages of a downturn,” said Don Tomnitz, the Texas-based group’s president and chief executive. DR Horton closed more than 53,000 homes over the past 12 months, but its cancellation rate rose to 40 per cent in the three months to September 30, and climbed as high as 51 per cent in the once-booming Florida market.The pattern mirrors the problems affecting the other public builders, which account for a quarter of new home construction in the US. All are being forced to raise discounts to shift unsold stock and are cutting back on new construction after speculators exited the market earlier this year.The uncertainty over future demand is spilling into retail and other sectors, with Caterpillar warning last month that its domestic sales could be flat because of lower demand for its construction equipment.Fears that consumer spending will fall in the wake of the year-long slowdown are being closely watched by US policymakers, and played a key role in the Federal Reserve’s decision last month to leave interest rates unchanged for a third consecutive month.Mr Tomnitz said the bearish market had continued in October and early November, tempering hopes that it may have bottomed following data showing a sharp fall in selling prices and a drop in the inventory of single-family homes.“The industry in general needs to build fewer homes,” he said at a conference last week, echoing remarks by other public builders who argue that privately-owned rivals are continuing construction to preserve cash flow.Mr Tomnitz has talked of a “bad psychology” in the market, with buyers fearful of suffering large falls in the value of their homes. “I’m absolutely convinced there’s a pool of pent-up demand being created,” he said. “I think in 2008 we’ll start to see a nice recovery in the housing market.The company did not provide earnings’ guidance for fiscal 2007, but its pledge to cut construction and trim speculative building helped lift its stock by7.8 per cent to $24.12 by midday in New York. Its stock price has fallen by 37 per cent so far this year, the worst performer among the four largest builders.

Producer price inflation fell sharply, potentially good news for the Federal Reserve.Affter a run of solid gains that has sent the S&P 500 index towards a six year high, buoyed by solid earnings running above 19 per cent on a year-on-year comparison for the third quarter, stocks are poised for a period of consolidation according to analysts.“The market has been brought a long way over the past 14 weeks and we now require a compelling signal to spark further gains,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market is not capped, it just looks like we will see a period of consolidation in November.”About an hour into the trading day stock indices were lower.The S&P 500 was down 3.54 points, or 0.3 per cent at 1380.88 while the Nasdaq Composite was down 7.07 points, or 0.3 per cent at 2399.31.Hurting the broad market was a sharp fall in Agilent, whose shares were off $2.24, or 6.4 per cent at $32.75. The maker of measuring equipment and technology said fourth-quarter net income was $152mn, or 36 cents a share, on revenue of $1.33bn. That was well short of an expected gain of 54 cents a share on sales.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37.06 points, or 0.3 per cent at 12,094.82.In earnings news, the nation’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart beat estimates, while hardware supplier chain, Home Depot fell short of expectations. Both companies are components of the Dow and Wal-Mart was the indice’s leading gainer.Wal-Mart said net income rose to $2.65bn, or 63 cents per share in the third quarter ending October 31, from $2.37 billion, or 57 cents per share a year earlier. That was at the top end of the 59 to 63 cent guidance provided by the company last month and beat the consensus estimate of 60 cents per share. Shares hit a peak of $48.20 and were recently up $1.18, or 2.6 per cent at $47.50.Wal-Mart’s discount competitor TargetMeanwhile, Home Depot blamed a “very challenging housing environment” for a flat third-quarter profit, of 73 cents per share, that missed estimates of 75 cents per share.The company cut growth expectations, and now expects a 12 per cent rise in sales and a 4 to 5 per cent rise in earnings per share for the current fiscal year. That’s down from estimates set in August of 14 to 17 per cent growth in sales and a 10 to 14 per cent rise in earnings per share. Shares were off 35 cents, or 1 per cent at $36.05.Excessive pessimism over homebuilder DR Horton was sharply punctured after its earnings were released.The builder reported its fiscal fourth-quarter profit slid 51 per cent against the backdrop of the housing slump, however,Retailer Saks reported net income of $6.18mn, or 5 cents per share, for the fiscal third-quarter, beating estimates of 3 cents per share. Shares in the company rose 38 cents, or 1.9 per cent to $20.27.Shares in Staples were down 54 cents, or 2.1 per cent lower at $25.52 after the company’s earnings excluding one-time items arrived roughly in line with expectations. despite. Staples’ profit rose 18 per cent to $265mn, and the 36 cents per share result just pipped estimates of 35 cents per share.Shares in Ford were off 11 cents, or 1.24 per cent at $8.76 after the company restated earnings citing accounting errors, due to how interest rate hedging by its financial arm, Ford Motor Credit was calculated, dating back to 2001. The revision boosts the company’s net income since then by $850mn and narrows its $7.25bn net loss for the first nine months of 2006 to $7bn.Stock index futures were indicating a bright start in early trade and then pushed higher after retail sales and wholesale inflation reports for October arrived.Headline retail sales fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2%, less than the projected fall of 0.4 per cent, while sales for September were revised lower to a decline of 0.8 per cent, versus an original drop of 0.4 per cent.Excluding automobile sales, the data revealed that sales fell 0.4 per cent, more than the projected decline of 0.3 per cent.“The main story on retail sales was the sharp revisions to the September data, while the October was fairly close to expectations,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. “The market is apt to still take away a view that the consumer has been restrained in spending the income that had been going to gas when gas prices were higher.”Meanwhile investors were soothed by the inflation picture at the wholesale level.

434;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Buy-out groups on global spree;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is in the middle of an unprecedented global shopping spree, which continued yesterday after Linde, the German industrial gases group, said the buy-out firm was acquiring its forklift business Kion for €4bn ($5.1bn) alongside Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.Armed with a fund of $16.5bn and a loyal band of lending banks, KKR is hunting for deals in every corner of the world, from flagship retailers in Australia and South Africa, to French national champions such as Vivendi.Until fairly recently, the most that buy-out groups had raised for their funds was $7bn, limiting the size of their targets.Now, however, a handful of funds are twice that size, and almost any company is within their reach.Buying such large companies has become even easier when several buy-out groups club together.For many, the issue is no longer the amount of money available, but the reception they receive from boards and company shareholders, many of which fear they could be selling too cheaply.KKR, for its part, has had several of its buy-out attempts fail spectacularly.Most recently, the group’s €40bn ($51bn) attempt to win over the board of Vivendi, the French music and telecoms group, collapsed on several technical issues, including tax. Despite an inside track with the French group – the wife of Henry Kravis, Marie-Josée, until last year was a member of Vivendi’s supervisory board – and a cordial relationship with some of the French group’s top brass, KKR was unable to make the deal work.And when George Roberts, another KKR founder, tried to woo the board of Coles Myer, Australia’s second-largest food retailer in August, to accept a US$13.8bn offer, he too failed in his mission.The problem is not KKR’s alone. In the UK, several companies, including Informa, the publishing company, Northgate Information Solutions, the payroll systems group, and Morgan Crucible, the ceramics maker, both called off bid talks with private equity firms. But KKR is undaunted and has already taken part in a string of deals worth more than $100bn.These include beating its own long-standing record for the world’s largest LBO, when it led a consortium to acquire HCA, the US hospitals chain, for $33bn, including debt.In Europe, it has succeeded with buy-out teams to acquire VNU, the Netherlands-listed media group, for $11.6bn, and paid $11bn to take control of NXT, the semiconductors unit of Philips.Its aggressive approach to securing some of its targets has not always endeared it to its peers. Earlier this year, KKR attempted to prise away Freescale, another semiconductor business, which was already in late-stage talks with rival buy-out group Blackstone.The move angered Blackstone, which accused KKR of upsetting the normal code of conduct among private equity groups.But no rejection by a board or a spat with a rival is likely to stop KKR’s hunger to control some of the world’s best companies.Indeed, industry observers have cited companies such as Home Depot and Dell of the US, and BT and Unilever in Europe as potential acquisitions for either KKR or its rivals.
435;HD;Home Depot;2006-10-27T16:27:10Z;Whitney Tilson: Opportunity to sample the treats;;"When it comes to owning stocks of the best-known businesses in the world, value investors usually feel like children looking through the window of the candy store, unable to afford the treats inside because they refuse to pay the prices such high-quality franchises typically bear. But a rare opportunity appeared over the past year for value investors to go inside the store and sample the treats.As recently as mid-July, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, both heavily weighted in large-cap growth stocks, were roughly flat for the year, and this category was the worst performing over the previous one, three and
five years. Such underperformance is hardly surprising, given how overvalued blue-chip growth stocks had become during the bubble in the late 1990s. By early 2000, companies such as Home Depot, Wal-Mart, Dell and Microsoft were trading at absurd multiples, with price/earnings ratios well above 50. Since then, while earnings for companies such as these have grown, the stocks are down because multiples contracted dramatically as the market herd moved on to small-caps, real estate and commodities.As contrarians who like to buy quality on the cheap, we began investing in a range of blue-chip stocks last year and accumulated positions in Berkshire Hathaway, McDonald’s, Microsoft, Wal-Mart, Anheuser-Busch, Wendy’s, Costco, Tyco, Foot Locker, Dell and Heinz, all of which we still own. This strategy has particularly started to pay off in the latest market rally, to the point where our mutual fund, the Tilson Focus fund (TILFX), was the top performer of 833 funds in its Multicap Core category over the 12 months ending September 30, according to Lipper.Have such blue-chip “growth” stocks had their run? Alan Abelson, the Barron’s curmudgeon, thinks so. “Mutual funds and their more adventurous, far more addicted to debt and often more feckless younger kin, hedge funds, have piled into the big-caps because the consensus has opined that the big-caps are the place to be,” he wrote last weekend. “This has proved rather a self-fulfilling analysis since their very piling in has been very much one of the reasons the big-caps have been the place to be. How long this ring-around-the-rosy, Wall Street-style, can go on before it all falls down is anybody’s guess. Ours is: not very long.”We respectfully disagree. The S&P 500 is trading at a modest 18 times trailing earnings, relative to 35 for the Nasdaq and a more ridiculous 36 for the Russell 2000. Particularly in a late-cycle period of moderating growth, large, high-quality businesses should trade at a premium, not a discount to technology and small companies.In addition, the cycles between large-caps versus small-caps, and growth versus value, tend to last for many years. Rich Pzena of Pzena Asset Management has identified four distinct periods since the beginning of 1969 in which the S&P 500 (ie “growth”) stocks dominated and four in which buying low price-to-book (ie “value”) stocks did. (Value stocks were defined as the 200 stocks among the largest 1,000 that had the lowest price/book ratios.)These data suggest some interesting things. First, buying low price-to-book stocks has produced superior returns over extended periods of time but there have also been periods of significant underperformance. Second, the average time in which growth stocks dominated was 37 months, whereas when value stocks returned to favour, they remained in favour for an average of 76 months. Interestingly, 76 months from the beginning of the latest value cycle in March 2000 took us to the middle of this year, which is when large-cap growth stocks started to outperform and traditional low price-to-book stocks started to underperform.Are growth stocks due to outperform for another two or three years? I don’t know and, as a bottoms-up stock picker, I don’t really care. But I can say that value investors such as me continue to see more “value” today in stocks that have traditionally been characterised as “growth”.Whitney Tilson is a money manager who co-edits Value Investor Insight and co-founded the Value Investing Congress.

436;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:27+0000;The answer;;Win Swenson: These facts are similar to those that have been debated over the compensation process at Home Depot. There, the company’s lead director issued a statement (defending its pay to CEO Robert Nardelli) that closely parallels the first of the two possible answers. Some institutional investors and other compensation experts have taken a position that closely tracks the second possible answer.Both sides have a point. Moreover, one can argue that the transparency of the process has appropriately left it to the marketplace to resolve – if shareholders do not like the result they can simply move their capital elsewhere.The major problem with the first answer is the lesson it teaches internally – within the corporate culture. Company codes of conduct implore employees to make decisions on the merits, and to avoid even the appearance of a conflict. To cite one example from these facts, the use of the same compensation lawyer by both Mr. Franco and one of the compensation committee members means that when compensation issues with Mr. Franco arise (or at renewal of his pay package) the compensation committee member will be negotiating with his/her own lawyer – clearly a conflict that sacrifices the company’s best interests. Companies tell employees never to agree on setting prices, but the facts here at least suggest that mutual back-scratching may be playing a role in establishing the “price” of Mr. Franco’s compensation. Even if the board concludes that the marketplace can sort this out, the reality is that employees in a company pay more attention to what their leaders do than to what they say.Go back for more ethical dilemmas.Do you agree with Win Swenson?

437;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
438;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Wal-Mart set for $1bn China acquisition;;Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, on Monday night appeared close to sealing a landmark $1bn acquisition in China, after emerging as the leading bidder in a year-long auction for Trust-Mart, China’s second-largest hypermarket chain.People close to the negotiations said that Wal-Mart had edged out France’s Carrefour and local competitors, but cautioned that the details remained to be finalised and the deal could still fall through at the eleventh hour.A purchase of Trust-Mart, which is privately-owned by Taiwanese entrepreneurs, would represent one of Wal-Mart’s largest acquisitions in recent years. It highlights how China has become an important battleground for international supermarket chains as its rapid urbanisation and rising standards of living are creating a new consumer class.Although Wal-Mart recently exited Germany and South Korea, it considers China a priority for its international expansion. It currently owns 66 stores in China.Amy Wyatt, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, called the deal “speculation” and declined to comment. Regulatory approval by China’s powerful Ministry of Commerce could hold up the deal.Many international retailers have been looking to expand in China to take advantage of the country’s rapid economic growth. Last month Office Depot, the US office products retailer, said it planned to take a controlling stake in AsiaEC, one of China’s largest dealers of office supplies and services. And earlier this year Best Buy, the US consumer electronics retailer, took a controlling stake in Jiangsu Five Star, a Shanghai-based store chain. Home Depot, the second-largest US retailer, has also been looking for possible partners in China.Wal-Mart’s move comes three months after the discounter sold its 85 German stores to Metro, that country’s largest retail group, putting an end to eight loss-making years in which it tried to break into a market dominated by discounters. The sale was Wal-Mart’s most significant international retreat, and followed its decision earlier this year to pull out of a smaller loss-making operation in South Korea.According to Euromonitor International, Trust-Mart last year generated $1.4bn of sales in the hypermarket category, giving it the second-largest market share at 5.8 per cent. Wal-Mart generated $764m of sales at its hypermarkets, a share of 3.1 per cent of the market, while market leader Carrefour had sales of $2.2bn - an 8.8 per cent share of the category.
439;HD;Home Depot;2006-10-05T15:52:55Z;Retailers give customers the final word;;Calamari, the online pseudonym of a customer of Sears.com, is not too impressed by her new Kenmore HE2 Plus front-loading washing machine, which she bought from the US retailer for $800 after her old top-loader expired this summer.“I now wash my towels twice, even though the ‘whitest whites’ hot water cycle is 80-something minutes long,” she writes in an impassioned online product review carried on Sears’ website next to the retailer’s description of the product.Sears’ exclusive Kenmore brand is one of the retailer’s strongest assets. But this summer, it took the bold step of allowing online customers to share their experiences by posting reviews on Sears.com. For the Kenmore HE2 Plus, the move has resulted in nine customer reviews and an undistinguished rating of three out of a possible five stars.Chris Shimojima, Sears’ general manager of e-commerce, says the retailer decided the benefits of opening up a dialogue with its customers far outweighed any potential risk to its reputation.“It was a decision that we made sure everyone was aware of and everyone had agreed to, from merchants to senior company leadership,” he says of the move to launch reviews three months ago. “But the response was very favourable across the board.”Since being popularised in particular by Amazon, online reviews have become a regular feature on specialised retail websites selling everything from shoes to electronic products, and at comparison shopping sites such as Shopzilla and Pricegrabber.But this year the concept has spread to established mainstream retailers in the US: Macy’s, the department store chain, Home Depot, the home improvement store, and Target, the discount store, have all launched online product reviews in the past 12 months.“Reviews are catching on in a big way,” says Joan Broughton, of Shop.org, an e-commerce industry group. “They help more fully describe the product in a way that is credible to customers.”Reviews offer a way for retailers to form valuable links to customers who are often the most active online shoppers. But the trend has also been facilitated by the emergence this year of Bazaarvoice, a Texas-based company that provides both the software and the support and analysis for retailers who do not want to spend the resources on developing their own reviews.Sears, Macy’s and Home Depot are clients of Bazaarvoice, as is Petco, a pet supplies retailer, and Overstock, the comparison shopping site, which switched to the service after running its own reviews for three years.Sears’ Mr Shimojima says that having the platform already available, rather than having to build one from scratch, was “a big part” of the decision to launch reviews.As well as providing sites with add-on software to handle reviews and ratings, the company also monitors comments and analyses customers’ feedback – giving it insights that can then be applied to the retailer’s bricks-and-mortar merchandising. At Sears, Mr Shimojima says the review analysis is distributed throughout the retailer.With just 50 employees, including home-based reviewers assigned to particular retailers, Bazaarvoice does not edit submissions, and only rejects reviews on decency and privacy grounds. “It’s very important to have an authentic review community,” says Sam Decker, head of marketing at Bazaarvoice.Petco, which was one of Bazaarvoice’s first clients, has used its online customer ratings to select top products for inclusion in marketing e-mails, reporting significantly higher customer responses as a result.Andy Kurlander, head of marketing at Zappos, the online shoe retailer that runs its own review service, also notes that reviews can help reduce the costs of returns by giving customers a clearer idea of what to expect. But for retailers with physical shops, opening the doors to reviews can be challenging, the decision often rising to chief executive or marketing director level.Ms Broughton, at Shop.org, says that, in her former job as head of multi-channel sales at REI, the outdoor equipment retailer, she was initially “dead against” the idea of opening the site to customer reviews, before seeing their potential.And in spite of Calamari’s harsh views, Mr Shimojima says Sears is “totally happy with the learnings, and the dialogue we’re creating”.
440;HD;Home Depot;2006-09-28T14:37:24Z;Office Depot makes China move;;Office Depot, the US office products retailer, said on Thursday it plans to take a controlling stake in AsiaEC, one of China’s largest dealers of office supplies and services.The deal is the latest move by a US retailer into China. Best Buy, the US consumer electronics retailer, ealier this year took a controlling stake in Jiangsu Five Star, a Shanghai-based store chain. Home Depot, the second largest US retailer, has also been looking for possible partners in China, while Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has been steadily expanding its presence there.AsiaEC was founded in 1999 by four graduates of MIT’s Sloan school of management with venture capital backing as a business-to-business e-commerce retailer, targeting foreign owned operations and top Chinese companies.In 2000 it attracted funding from venture capital investors led by the Carlyle Group and Warburg Pincus.Office Depot did not say how much it had paid for its stake.The retailer does not operate stores, but is engaged in contract sales, direct mail, and internet businesses, selling office supplies, technology, furniture, custom printing and promotional items, and business services.While Office Depot operates over 1,000 stores in the US, its international operations in some countries - including Japan - are based around catalogue and internet sales only. In Asia, the retailer operates 21 stores in Japan alongside a direct mail, contract and internet business. It also has joint ventures and licensing deals in Thailand and Korea.Charles Brown, the head of Office Depot’s international operations, said the AsiaEC deal “gives Office Depot a significant presence in the fast growing Chinese market, and allows us to further leverage our operations in Japan and South Korea.”Tim Liu, the founder and chief executive of AsiaEC, will remain at the head of the unit. He said the deal would combine Asia’s “scalable business structure” with the US firm’s multi-channel sales expertise.Office Depot is the second largest US offfice supplies retailer with annual sales of around $15bn - trailing Staples, which acquired an internet and contract sales subsidiary in China in 2005.
441;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Lowe’s sees profit at low end of forecast;;Lowe’s, the world’s second-largest home improvement retailer, has warned that current sales are falling below expectations, adding to signs of a slowdown in the US housing market.Robert Niblock, chief executive, said declining housing turnover and high energy costs were among the factors causing the company to take a “more cautious outlook” for the rest of the year.Lowe’s and other do-it-yourself chains have been among the biggest beneficiaries of soaring growth in the US housing market over recent years, as rising property values and brisk housing turnover have encouraged spending on home improvement.But that trend is now weakening as the housing market cools.Lowe’s had already lowered its earnings guidance for this year twice before Monday’s announcement.The company said it expected full-year profits to meet its most recently revised target, set last month, but warned they might be at the low end of guidance.Home Depot, the largest US home improvement retailer, has also experienced a slowdown in sales and warned of an increasingly challenging business environment.Lowe’s warning comes as sentiment elsewhere in the US retail sector is improving because of the recent decline in fuel prices and halt in interest rate rises.Mr Niblock said the reduced number of storms during this year’s hurricane season would also weigh on results compared with last year, when hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused a spike in DIY sales as homeowners repaired damaged properties.Home Depot has increased pressure on Lowe’s by increasing investment in its stores in a bid to offset the downturn by wresting market share from competitors. It has committed $350m to improving stores, including a sharp increase in the number of customer service staff.Lowe’s is to outline its strategy on Tuesday. “I’m confident we have the plans and people in place to ensure we continue to . . . gain market share,” said Mr Niblock, in a statement on Monday.The company said it planned to open more than 150 stores in each of the next two years, representing annual increases in total sales space of at least 10 per cent.Lowe’s has been growing faster than Home Depot in recent years because, with nearly 1,300 stores, it has more room left to grow in the US than its bigger rival, which has more than 2,000 stores.
442;HD;Home Depot;2006-09-25T12:37:53Z;Wall St lower on further evidence of slowdown;;Wall Street finished the week lower on Friday, as investor relief over the Federal Reserve’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged was countered by fresh evidence of slowing economic growth.Large-cap technology stocks made some of the most dramatic moves during the week. Yahoo slumped 13 per cent over the five days to $25.52, wiping out the previous eight weeks of gains. The company said third-quarter results would be at the bottom end of their previously forecast range due to slowing advertising revenue.Oracle provided a counterweight to Yahoo’s slump, climbing 7.4 per cent to $17.54. On Wednesday, the software maker reported a 29 per cent increase in first quarter profits, as its chief executive said the company was gaining market share from German rival SAP.Hewlett-Packard shed 3 per cent to $35.11 over the week as its controversial investigation into boardroom leaks to the media began to unnerve investors. News reports said that chief executive Mark Hurd may have had a greater role in the investigation than had previously been thought.Microsoft dipped 0.7 per cent to $26.66. However, the stock has now gained 25 per cent since the middle of June and is back in positive territory for the year.Media group Tribune, owner of the Los Angeles Times, surged 9.8 per cent to $33.99, its best week in more than two years, after it appointed a special committee to oversee a business review that might lead to a sale of some assets or a leveraged buyout of the group.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent for the week at 1,314.78, a loss on the day of 0.3 per cent, or 3.25 points. On Wednesday, the index briefly hit its highest level in more than five years. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower on the week, losing 0.8 per cent, or 18.82 points, on the day to 2,218.93.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the week down 0.5 per cent, a loss of 0.2 per cent, or 25.13 points, on the day at 11,508.10.Stocks made a brief rally on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent. However, on Thursday the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s manufacturing index fell sharply, increasing investor unease that economic growth was slowing faster than had been thought.“The run-up to this point has been driven by an expectation that the Fed will stop raising rates and get the cooling in the economy they’re looking for,” said Joseph Battipaglia, chief market strategist at Ryan Beck.“The price you’re paying for that is uncertainty about how much softening there will be in the economy. A soft landing is something that the Fed cannot engineer. It’s out of their hands.”Fears of a slowdown in manufacturing affected Caterpillar, which sank 4.1 per cent to $62.77 – the week’s worst performance in the Dow. United Technologies, also suffered, losing 3.6 per cent to $62.30.General Motors tumbled 3.3 per cent to $30.62 on reports that talks on a possible alliance with Nissan and Renault had made little progress.Symbol Technologies, a maker of barcode scanners and mobile computers, surged 15.2 per cent to $14.64 after Motorola agreed to buy the company for $3.9bn.Darden Restaurants leapt 9.3 per cent to $42.38 after its first quarter profits beat analyst estimates and it raised earnings guidance for 2006 on bullish forecasts for revenue from its Olive Garden chain of Italian-themed restaurants.Home improvement retailer Home Depot suffered from the slowing housing market, sinking 3.4 per cent to $35.96. The stock has fallen 11 per cent since the beginning of the year.Medical device maker Boston Scientific reported preliminary sales and earnings figures for the third quarter that came in below analyst estimates. Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the stock from “overweight” to “underweight”, and the shares tumbled 8.5 per cent to $14.85.First Data, provider of electronic payment systems, sank 9.3 per cent to $40.49. Early in the week, its Western Union subsidiary – which the company plans to spin off – said income growth would be sluggish in coming years, as immigrants who use the service to send money to relatives grow concerned about government scrutiny of wire transfers.

Schlumberger gained 4.6 per cent to $58.84, and ExxonMobil rose 2.2 per cent to $66.08.Steelmaker Nucor added 4.3 per cent to $48.77, and copper miner Phelps Dodge rose 3 per cent to $86.21.First Data, provider of electronic payment systems, sank 7.6 per cent to $41.25 after Standard & Poors cut its rating on the company’s debt from A+ to A.Freescale Semiconductor jumped 5.7 per cent to $39.26 on news that the chipmaker would be bought for $17.6bn by a private equity consortium led by the Blackstone Group.Symbol Technologies, a maker of barcode scanners and mobile computers, soared 15.4 per cent to $14.67 on reports that it was putting itself up for sale.Applied Materials, a manufacturer of chipmaking equipment, rose 3.4 per cent to a four-month high of $17.78 after it announced plans to buy back up to $5bn of its own stock over the next three years.Not all technology stocks were as strong however. Ebay fell 3.6 per cent to $26.84, and Sun Microsystems shed 3 per cent to $5.12.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 1.31 points, at 1,321.18, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat, up 0.16 points, at 2,235.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1 per cent, or 5.77 points, at 11,555.00.The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meets on Wednesday and is widely expected to keep rates unchanged.“Confidence seems to be growing that the Fed will pull off a soft landing,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.Consumer cyclical stocks came under pressure. Home improvement retailer Home Depot sank 1.7 per cent to $36.58 after Credit Suisse cut its rating on the stock from “outperform” to “neutral”, saying a weakening housing market could lead to earnings shortfalls.Ford Motor continued to slump after it announced steep cost-cutting measures on Friday. The carmaker dropped 2.5 per cent to $7.82.Intercontinental Exchange gained 2.4 per cent to $76.15, after it was upgraded from “neutral” to “buy” by Bank of America, which cited the exchange’s recent announcement that it would buy the New York Board of Trade.

The gains brought the Dow Jones Industrial Average to within 170 points of its all time high, set in January 2000.Microsoft announced that its Zune digital music player – a rival to Apple’s iPod – would be available for the Christmas shopping season. Goldman Sachs also raised its price target on the stock from $30 to $33, and said the company’s Vista operating system might meet its January release date. Microsoft shares jumped 4.9 per cent over the week to $26.85, their highest level since April.Reports of buyout activity were behind two of the week’s biggest moves. Freescale Semiconductor, which was spun off by Motorola in 2004, soared 20.8 per cent to $37.16 over the week on rumours that two private equity groups were bidding to buy the chipmaker for about $16bn. If the deal goes through, it will be the largest leveraged buyout to date in the technology industry.Home improvement retailer Home Depot leapt 8.1 per cent to $37.22 on rumours that Edward Lampert, a well-known hedge fund manager, might invest in the company.There were other signals of strength in the consumer sector. Electronics retailer Best Buy gained 16.2 per cent to $53.83 over the week, after it announced a better than expected gain in second quarter earnings, helped by robust sales of flat panel televisions. Rival Circuit City followed suit, leaping 14.1 per cent to $26.12.Investment banks surged after a flurry of better-than-expected earnings reports. Goldman Sachs gained 8.6 per cent to $162.71, and Legg Mason climbed 13.3 per cent to $102.20.

On Friday, data showed that core consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent in August, in line with expectations, cooling fears of rising inflation.“The week’s themes were all positive,” said Fritz Meyer, senior investment officer at AIM Investments.“Gasoline is down, mortgage rates are down, and consumer spending is holding up,” he said.“Stocks like it, and they like the combination of healthy economic growth coupled with fading anxiety over inflation.”Commodities had another bad week with crude oil, copper and gold all sliding. The S&P Diversified Metals and Mining Index slumped 8.8 per cent, and eight of the 10 worst performers in the S&P 500 for the week were miners and energy companies.On the week, Freeport McMoran and Newmont Mining slumped 10.6 per cent to $52.10 and 8.4 per cent to $44.15, respectively. ExxonMobil sank 3.2 per cent to $64.65.The lower energy prices proved a boon for Wal-Mart, however, which added 3.2 per cent to $48.22, while energy-intensive chemical maker Dupont, ticked up 5.6 per cent over the week to $42.25.Ford Motor announced it would cut annual costs by about $5bn and shed 10,000 salaried jobs - in addition to cuts of 4,000 previously announced – as part of its restructuring plan. Merrill Lynch cut its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “sell”, and the car maker’s shares closed the week down 8.6 per cent to $8.02.Software maker Adobe Systems posted a 35 per cent drop in quarterly profit after the bell on Thursday.

445;HD;Home Depot;2006-09-14T07:48:42Z;DIY market challenging for Kingfisher;;A tough UK home improvement market contributed to a fall in Kingfisher’s interim profits, but Europe’s largest home improvement retailer predicted its flagship chain B&Q would return to profit growth in the second half.Retail profit - the company’s common measure - at B&Q fell 43 per cent to £82.6m in the first half on comparable sales that declined by 5.5 per cent to £2bn.Gerry Murphy, chief executive, said: “The continuing weakness of the UK home improvement market has again impacted B&Q’s overall sales and margin performance.” He added that the company’s improvement programme which includes refurbishing its biggest outlets was showing signs of progress but that the market would remain challenging for the rest of the year.Last week, Bob Nardelli, chief executive of Home Depot, the largest US home improvement retailer, reinforced the feeling that life is getting still tougher for the DIY specialists when he told the FT that his company would not expand in Europe because of the market’s fragmentation and lacklustre economic growth. His statement also ended the bid rumours that regularly make Home Depot the most likely buyer for Kingfisher.On Thursday, Homebase, the DIY chain owned by GUS, reported a 3 per cent fall in like-for-like sales in the first six months of the year, with growth in furniture and kitchens offset by weakness in core DIY and decorating ranges.However, Kingfisher’s drop in profits on Thursday was slightly lower than some analysts had been expecting, and the shares edged up from 239¾p to 246p in early morning trading in London.The UK trade business, Screwfix direct, continued to do well, with sales up 25 per cent and retail profit up 76 per cent to £10.9m.In France, comparable sales rose by 1.4 per cent to £1.5bn, while retail profit fell 6 per cent to £95.5m, after costs of £8m attributed to store format changes and a new IT system. Numis Securities termed the performance in France “disappointing” but said it would upgrade its forecast and target price on the back of better-than-expected overall results.In the rest of Europe, profits increased by 36 per cent to £52.1m. In Asia, losses increased to £6.6m on store conversions, and B&Q predicted China would return to profitability in the second half.Across the group, retail profit fell by 20 per cent to £231.5m on comparable sales that fell by 0.5 per cent to £4.3bn. Adjusted pre-tax profit fell by 29 per cent, but earnings were unchanged as Kingfisher benefited from an exceptional gain of £42m on a property disposal.The company kept its interim dividend the same as last year.
446;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Mobile operators seek to reverse 3G charges;;Comment on this columnLessons of technology mania, six years onLiving with the consequences of your decisions and learning from your mistakes are two of the signs that a child is growing up.Mobile phone operators are still maturing, judging from their attempt in the European Court of Justice to recover £3bn of the amount they paid the government for third-generation mobile phone licences. Playing the role of supernanny, the court’s advocate-general this week issued some stern discipline in the form of a preliminary ruling rejecting the arguments of Vodafone, O2, T-Mobile, Orange and Hutchison. The companies say that they should be eligible for a tax refund from the government, which was paid £22.5bn for the licences in the midst of the European 3G frenzy of 2000.For long-suffering shareholders, the case has a certain grim sense, although one has to wonder whether the companies would have brought it at all if their investment had paid off. Any company that has lost as much as the mobile operators is bound to look for a way to recoup something, even if it is through the sort of retrospective examination of the small-print that most mobile customers are denied. (Essentially, the companies are asking the European Court whether the licence sales were subject to value-added tax).Given that the mania for licences cost mobile phone operators across Europe nearly £70bn, the eventual full court judgement is bound to have wider ramifications. If the judges agree with the advocate-general, as they often do, at least investors will be able to console themselves with evidence that phone companies have absorbed the second lesson of growing up: having written off billions, they are never again likely to bet so much on a single technology or rely so heavily on their own forecast of what consumers want.Those consumers, coincidentally, seem to be warming to 3G at last, although there is loose talk of “4G” that would use rival technologies such as WiMAX. If only the phone companies had known this six years ago. But then that is another lesson of adulthood: life isn’t fair.DIY gets hammeredGoing to the DIY store this weekend? Thought not.The pressure is on again in the out-of-town retail parks of Britain. On Thursday, Fitch, the credit rating agency, cut the mezzanine loan rating of Focus, one of the UK’s three largest general DIY chains, to CC– two points above default.The same day, Bob Nardelli told the FT that Home Depot, the US home improvement heavyweight where he is chief executive, would not expand in Europe. He is worried about the European market’s fragmentation, planning strictures and lacklustre economic growth.That should end the bid rumours that regularly make Home Depot the most likely buyer for Kingfisher, owner of B&Q, but it also reinforces the feeling that life is getting still tougher for the DIY specialists, which are struggling to recover from hard times last year.Fitch’s worry about Focus centres on the large amount of debt that the private-equity-owned chain is carrying. The strain on the balance sheet puts Focus in a tricky position given the prospect of consolidation in its part of the DIY market and the need to fight the competition with better promotions, pricing and stores.B&Q is one of those companies that is ploughing energy into refits of its biggest outlets. The third big chain – Homebase, part of Argos, which is soon to be demerged from GUS – also has greater firepower than Focus, although all are suffering the same malaise.Customers who do venture into the retail parks are going to find brighter stores, better lay-outs and improved service. But, as DIY enthusiasts know, interior decorating tends to drain resources before it adds to the value of your home – if it ever does. Mr Nardelli is wise to stay out of the crossfire.Austin Reed still openNick Hollingworth, chief executive of Austin Reed, used to work for privately owned Arcadia. So did Alan Charlton, since June the quoted retailer’s finance director. That has prompted much speculation that they will at some point drag Austin Reed from the public to the private side of the high street through a buy-out.The idea has something to commend it – Austin Reed’s Regent Street flagship is said to be worth £23m or more and debt has decreased. With the support of dependable baby boomers, the income from both the menswear and Country Casuals ladieswear brands should be fairly predictable in the coming years.Friday’s approach for Austin Reed from 29.9 per cent shareholder Dawnay Day, the investment firm, does not carry Mr Hollingworth’s name, however. Presumably that means he supported the rest of the board – where Tim How, savvy chief executive of Majestic Wine, is senior independent director – in rejecting the bid. Investors should wait for more clarity before backing Dawnay Day.Comment on this columnandrew.hill@ft.com
447;HD;Home Depot;2006-09-08T16:41:44Z;Mark Sellers: Home Depot needs to launch share buy-back;;The management team of Home Depot, led by Robert Nardelli, the former General Electric star, employs a “balanced” approach to capital management. This includes a mix of dividend payouts, acquisitions, capital expenditures and share buy-backs. I believe Home Depot should temporarily alter this approach to take advantage of an opportunity to create huge shareholder value with little effort. This opportunity won’t last forever.Specifically, I believe Home Depot should offer to repurchase 25 per cent of its outstanding stock in a tender offer, using debt to finance the transaction. (This is in addition to the 17 per cent of shares the company has purchased over the past five years.)My reasoning is as follows. Retail investors have been net sellers of mega cap stocks such as Home Depot for each of the past three years, causing prices of the largest US companies to stagnate or decline even as earnings have increased.The influx of capital to hedge funds further exacerbates this problem. Nearly all long-short equity hedge funds focus on small caps. Hedge funds are not buying Home Depot stock. Much of the new money going into hedge funds is probably coming out of large cap mutual funds.Some investors believe that Home Depot’s earnings will decline because of a slowdown in the housing market. In fact, the company’s earnings have increased each year since its initial public offering in 1984 – through two declines in the housing market and two recessions.Today, Home Depot’s stock is at 11 times trailing 12-month earnings, cheaper than it has been since it went public.The economics of stock buy-backs are simple yet few corporations seem to understand them. When you buy back stock at a price above the intrinsic value of the company, you destroy value. When you buy back stock at, or close to, the intrinsic value, you create no value and the buy-back is a waste of time and effort.But when you have the rare opportunity to buy back shares at a bargain price, you create value for shareholders with each share you repurchase and retire. The key is the intrinsic value of the underlying company.Based on a discounted cash flow model, I believe Home Depot’s intrinsic value is at least $50. At $34, the stock is 30 per cent below its intrinsic value. A 500m share repurchase (25 per cent of the outstanding shares) would, therefore, create more than $8bn value for shareholders.Many buy-backs are only neutral to shareholder value or even destructive. Companies that engage in “serial” buy-backs year in and year out, regardless of the share price, are essentially destroying value over the long term.Their managements are abusing shareholder capital in order to prop up the share price so they can exercise and sell their options at a profit. I have witnessed this value destruction too many times.There are companies that opportunistically increase their repurchases only when the shares are undervalued.International Game Technology, the leading slot machine manufacturer, has a history of increasing repurchases when stock is at a multi-year low and decreasing buy-backs when stock is at a multi-year high.There’s another reason Home Depot ought to increase its share repurchases – its private market valuation is probably greater than its public valuation. There has been a number of leveraged buy-outs in the retail sector over the past few years. Nearly all of these have been done at higher multiples than Home Depot’s current one.Home Depot owns 58 per cent of the land under its retail stores and 87 per cent of its buildings (the rest are leased). I estimate the value of the land and buildings to be close to $20bn.What I’m proposing is essentially a mini-leveraged buy-out using the borrowing capacity of Home Depot’s real estate. It would need to borrow about $17bn to repurchase 25 per cent of its outstanding shares.This amount of debt is about 1.3 times trailing 12-month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, an amount that would allow it to maintain its investment-grade credit rating and lower its cost of capital.If the markets won’t give Home Depot the valuation it deserves, management owes it to the shareholders to do something.Mark Sellers is a hedge fund manager with Sellers Capital in Chicago.msellers@sellerscapital.com
448;HD;Home Depot;2006-09-01T17:32:05Z;On Wall Street: Not such a bad dream;;You know about the American Dream. How about this for the American Nightmare?Prodigal US shoppers, worried about high gasoline prices and a declining housing market, keep their credit cards in their wallets.The slump in the propensity of consumers to swipe their Amex cards causes sharp falls in company earnings, putting the brakes on the economy.The stock market falls victim to the same malaise, as groups’ stuttering earnings fail to keep up with their rich valuations.Scared? You should be. This week’s sharp deterioration in the mood of consumers brought the nightmare scenario a step closer to reality.The Conference Board consumer confidence index recorded its lowest reading since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina last year.Consumers’ predictions for the next six months were similarly gloomy and consistent with another widely watched survey released by the University of Michigan.On Wall Street, companies have done their best to confirm forecasts of a consumer-led slowdown.On Wednesday, Costco – the warehouse retailer that had been one of the sector’s star performers – stoked fears that higher-income shoppers are feeling the pinch with a surprise profit warning.It is in good company. Household names such as Home Depot, Starbucks, Wal-Mart and organic grocery chain Whole Foods have been wounded by reluctant consumers.With evidence like this, it is hard to disagree with predictions of an impending stock market correction.But I am going to try.For a start, the leading indicators of consumer confidence – Michigan’s and the Conference Board’s – often contradict one another and have diverged spectacularly as recently as April.But even when they agree, they are lousy indicators of future stock market performance. A study by Thomson Financial reveals that when consumers are bearish about the economy, stocks rally.On the four previous occasions when the University of Michigan’s index showed consumers in roughly the same pessimistic groove, the S&P 500 embarked on prolonged bull markets.It is true that consumer sentiment surveys are correlated with the business cycle and have correctly predicted the last two recessions in the US.But there is no guarantee that they will be third-time lucky, especially if the drivers for the current pessimism do not have a meaningful, lasting impact on the economy and the stock market.The first worry of the average Joe and Jane is higher petrol prices. With the precious liquid hovering around $3 a gallon for the past few months, those trips to Costco and Wal-Mart have somehow looked much less attractive.But the oil price now appears to be on the retreat. It fell below $70 a barrel for the first time in two months this week, adding a new, more romantic meaning to the term “sweet crude”.With Hurricane Ernesto demoted to tropical storm and harmlessly moving away from the Gulf of Mexico, pump prices should soon come down, leaving petrol-addicted Americans feeling better.The other consumer woe – the declining housing market – is more worrying, as unsold housing stocks are rising fast and price rises are moderating.But while economists are right to be concerned about the nasty wealth effects of a housing slowdown, investors can rest a little easier.The bursting of previous housing bubbles claimed just one, obvious stock market victim: the housebuilding sector. This time has been no different. Housebuilding stocks are down some 40 per cent from their peak, but other sectors have largely been left alone.But if the consensus is right and the economy slows down, why should companies and stocks remain immune?It is a question of degree and valuations. If the economy takes a gentle path towards slower growth, corporate profits will not suddenly collapse.With the S&P 500 still cheaper than its 10 and 20-year average, the resilience of earnings should prompt value-based and index-tracking investors to keep buying.For all the current doom and gloom, the American Nightmare may prove just as elusive as the American Dream.
449;HD;Home Depot;2006-08-29T16:45:52Z;FTSE gains strongly as Wolseley rallies;;Wolseley, the plumbing and building materials group, was in focus on Tuesday as its shares rallied from recent lows.Since peaking at a record £14.62 in March, Wolseley has been among the worst performers in the FTSE 100.A slowdown in the North American housing market, which is key for Wolseley, has seen its shares lose a quarter of their value. They hit their lowest level since May 2005 earlier this month, but were in demand yesterday, posting one of the biggest gains in the FTSE 100.Although there was talk of stake building and that Wolseley’s lowly rating – its shares trade on 10 times prospective earnings – could leave it vulnerable to a bid from Home Depot, City traders attributed the rise to the clearance of a stock overhang and results from Irish rival CRH.In spite of the US housing slowdown, CRH was able to deliver a 37 per cent rise in half-year figures and more importantly issue an upbeat outlook statement. It said stronger US-non residential and infrastructure demand would offset any further weakness in housing.Hopes that Wolseley will be able to make similar comments when it announces full-year results on September 25 saw its shares close 2.2 per cent higher at £10.89.In the wider market, leading shares started brightly but faded later. A combination of weaker-than-expected US consumer confidence figures and a poor performances from the heavyweight oil sector, as Brent crude futures dropped below $70 a barrel, were to blame.The FTSE 100 closed up just 9.7 points, or 0.17 per cent, at 5,888.3 after having hit 5,921.3 in mid-morning trade. The FTSE 250 gained 40.2 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 9,531.8.Market turnover improved, reaching 2.2bn shares as traders and fund managers started to return from their summer holidays.Of course, the falling oil price was not bad news for everybody. Transport stocks had a good day. British Airways climbed 4 per cent to a four-and-half year high of 414¼p while EasyJet rose 4.5 per cent to 454½p and Carnival, the cruise ship operator, gained 2.6 per cent to £21.74. Elsewhere, BAE Systems moved up 2.9 per cent to 373½p, excited by reports that Russian state bank Vneshtorgbank had spent about $1bn (£520m) buying a near 5 per cent stake in EADS, the defence contractor and Airbus planemaker.The Russian stake building rumours come as BAE Systems considers whether to sell its 20 per cent stake in Airbus to EADS.Drax, which operates Europe’s largest coal-fired power station, gave up 1.8 per cent to finish at 902p as Morgan Stanley placed 10m shares at 900p for an institutional client.Brewer SABMiller, up 0.6 per cent to £10.13, was a talking point amid reports that it is weighing up a bid for Australia’s Fosters. Analysts said a move was unlikely and Diageo, which reports full-year figures on Thursday was a more logical bidder.“Diageo’s strong market share in Australia would lead to strong synergies . . . and the Foster’s wine brands could be channelled through Diageo’s global distribution network,” Dresdner Kleinwort said in a note to clients. Diageo firmed up 0.1 per cent to 945p.Away from the blue chips, Signet dropped 7.8 per cent to 106¼p after Apax Partners and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts confirmed they were no longer interested in bidding for the jeweller, while MFI Furniture Group slipped 4.2 per cent to 85p in the wake of reports that claimed the sale of its loss-making UK retail business to Merchant Equity Partners had hit a snag.Ashtead, the industrial plant hire company, gained 3.7 per cent to 132½p after unveiling a higher-than-expected take-up – 96.2 per cent – for its £150m rights issue, which is being used to help finance its acquisition of US rival NationsRent. The “rump” of the rights issue – 5.7m shares – was quickly placed by UBS and JPMorgan Cazenove at 131¼p.Bid rumours continued to swirl around aerospace and defence group Cobham, up 2.6 per cent to 175 ½p. Merrill Lynch said it was possible that a financial buyer might be interested in the company given its low gearing and predictable cash generation.The stock was also boosted by a Deutsche Bank “buy” recommendation. Analyst Ben Fidler believes Cobham, which trades on 14 times prospective earnings, is cheap, and that half-year figures, due September 12, should impress.Babcock International gained 1.3 per cent to 338¾p on renewed bid rumour rumours.
450;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Barnes & Noble subpoenaed over options;;The stock options backdating scandal in corporate America widened on Tuesday as Barnes & Noble, the bookstore operator, became the latest company to be investigated by US authorities.In a brief regulatory statement filed on Tuesday, the New York-based bookseller said it has received a subpoena from the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, requesting documents regarding its stock-options practices.The company, which is already being informally investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, declined to offer further details on the subpoena, saying it intends to “cooperate fully” with the investigation.Last month, B&N announced that its board’s audit committee would conduct an internal review of its stock-options granting programme after a shareholder, Timothy Hill, filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful stock-options granting practices.More than 80 companies are currently being investigated by US authority over whether their managers might have improperly inflated the value of stock options by changing their grant dates to coincide with low points in the value of their companies’ shares.The practice, known as backdating, can fatten profits for options recipients when they sell their shares at higher market prices.The scandal has shocked boardrooms across the country and has led several companies to restate financial results to the tune of billions of dollars. Large companies which have admitted to having awarded backdated stock options to executives include home improvement retailer Home Depot, United Health Group, the health insurer, and Juniper Networks, the telecommunications equipment company.Shares in B&N were down 1 per cent at $34.93 in early trade in New York.
451;HD;Home Depot;2006-08-23T20:34:51Z;GE veteran defects to run VNU;;General Electric on Wednesday lost the head of its biggest division to VNU, the Dutch media and information group, in a move that underlines the growing ability of cash-rich private equity groups to attract experienced managers.The surprise departure of David Calhoun – a 27-year GE veteran who ran its $47bn infrastructure unit – to head VNU, which has sales of €3.5bn ($4.5bn), re-affirms the US group’s reputation as a provider of top executives to other leading companies.VNU, whose businesses include ACNielsen market research and Billboard magazine, was bought for €7.6bn in May, by a consortium of six private equity groups including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Carlyle Group.One Wall Street analyst commented on Wednesday: “Private equity is changing the world. They have the ability and the cash to attract the best talent.”Mr Calhoun’s appointment as chief executive is a coup for VNU, which had been accused of lacklustre management during the long battle with shareholders that preceded its sale.The consortium had to raise its offer twice to win over investors. Rob van den Bergh stepped down as chief executive in the middle of the fight, which also tarnished the reputation of Aad Jacobs, the former chairman.GE’s ability to increase profits and sales and focus on developing its own cadre of managers has meant that many of its top executives are coveted by others.However, the move by Mr Calhoun, 50, marks the first defection from the inner circle created by Jeffrey Immelt, who took over from Jack Welch as chairman and chief executive in 2001.The bitter battle to succeed Mr Welch prompted the two losers – James McNerney and Robert Nardelli – to leave for the 3M technology group and the Home Depot retailer respectively. Last year Mr McNerney became Boeing’s chief executive.In an e-mail to investors on Wednesday, Mr Calhoun, himself a contender for the Boeing job, said: “I know many people expected that when I left GE, it would be to run a big public company.“But …sheer size was not important. I already run a big part of the biggest and best public company in the world, GE. I have always wanted to test my entrepreneurial skills.”Mr Calhoun will be replaced by John Rice, the head of industrial business. His place will be filled by Lloyd Trotter who was in charge of operations.
452;HD;Home Depot;2006-08-22T18:44:31Z;Toll adds to fears of US housing slowdown;;Americans have sharply cut back on purchases of upmarket houses, according to Toll Brothers, the largest luxury homebuilder in the US, adding to signs of a crisis of confidence among buyers and fears of a consumer-led economic slowdown.Toll’s poor third-quarter results – its first quarterly profit fall in four years – and its warning on the outlook for the rest of the year, mirrors problems at other companies reliant on discretionary consumer spending such as Starbucks, a coffee chain, Home Depot, a DIY chain, and Whole Foods, an organic food retailer.“The bottom line is that no matter how you slice it or dice it, the consumer, on average, is feeling pretty bummed out and tapped out at the same time,” said David Rosenberg, North America economist at Merrill Lynch.The behaviour of consumers, whose debt-fuelled spending has underpinned US growth over the past few years, will be a key determinant of whether the slowing domestic economy achieves a “soft landing” or slumps into a recession.A significant reduction in US consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of domestic economic activity, would also affect export-dependent economies such as China and other developing countries in Latin America and eastern Europe.Robert Toll, chairman and chief executive of Toll, blamed the 19 per cent fall in third-quarter profits to $174.6m on an excess of housing stock and a lack of appetite by buyers who purchase homes as an investment.“The continuing malaise in the housing market . . . is the result of oversupply of inventory and a decline in confidence. The speculative buyers of 2004 and 2005 are now sellers,” he said.Economists say that buy-to-let investors and other marginal buyers have been deterred by rising mortgage payments and the small appreciation in the value of houses they own.The woes of the housing market was one of the reasons the Federal Reserve halted their streak of 17 consecutive rate rises this month.Fears that the housing slowdown is spreading to other sectors were compounded last week when a widely-watched survey by the University of Michigan found overall consumer confidence at its lowest level since the aftermath of hurricane Katrina last year.Toll shares were up 4 per cent to $25.84 in midday trade in New York on Tuesday because the results still exceeded analysts’ expectations.
453;HD;Home Depot;2006-08-21T20:55:39Z;US home improvement;;Investors are not waiting for the roof to collapse, but they expect some meaningful damage. Since January, shares in home improvement giants Lowe’s and Home Depot have both fallen by more than 15 per cent, while the broader US retail sector is off only 2 per cent. Amid fears of a general consumer slowdown, housing has taken centre stage.There are risks. Lowe’s on Monday cut its earnings forecasts and said that same-store sales growth could be as low as zero in the third quarter. But the company appeared to focus on general pressures facing consumers from high fuel prices and geopolitical concerns rather than the housing market itself – which the company expects to have a soft landing.Even if that is the case, however, it is worth a peek across the Atlantic at what happened to UK market leader Kingfisher when the housing market enjoyed a relatively soft landing. Sales growth turned negative and operating margins halved. Admittedly, most UK retailers also had a tough time, but it does give a sense of the damage that is possible for home improvement retailers when a red hot housing market stops sizzling.In the US, housing transactions are already well below last year’s peak. Further reductions should cut into home improvement companies’ sales growth, particularly as they face tougher comparisons against months where hurricane damage fuelled extra demand. And the likes of Home Depot and Lowe’s could find themselves more susceptible to cyclical housing swings than in the past. Their strong growth over many years has left fewer places fresh for expansion.Lowe’s remains a well-run company, and can take some steps to cushion the impact on margins if conditions worsen. Retail sales in general remain robust. But investors are right to have taken out some insurance on the share prices of Lowe’s and Home Depot, even if the gloomiest housing bears are proved wrong.

The company lowered its full-year sales guidance. Its shares tumbled 4 per cent to $28.35. The stock is down 15 per cent since the beginning of the year. Home Depot followed Lowe’s, shedding 1.4 per cent to $34.30.Ford Motor lost 7.5 per cent to $7.47 – its worst day since April – following Friday’s announcement of production cutbacks, including the mothballing of 10 assembly plants, to reduce inventory and speed up its turnround plan.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent, or 4.78 points, at 1,297.52. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8 per cent, or 16.20 points, at 2,147.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent, or 36.42 points, to 11,345.05.Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors, attributed the falls to investors taking money off the table following the strong gains of last week. “It’s a pullback, but its predictable,” he said. “We had a pretty unusual week [last week] and so it’s natural to expect some profit-taking.”Energy stocks bounced back as crude pushed higher on geopolitical concerns. Exxon Mobil added 1.1 per cent to $69.83 and Marathon Oil rose 3.1 per cent to $89.94.Transport stocks were hit by the gains in crude. Burlington Northern Santa Fe fell 3.5 per cent to $66.07 and Norfolk Southern lost 4.1 per cent to $42.46.Gold and related stocks benefited as investors sought a safe haven in the geopolitical unease. Newmont Mining gained 3.6 per cent to $52.55, while Barrick Gold rose 4.2 per cent to $33.00.Fading hopes for an immediate resolution to a strike by Chilean miners at the Escondida copper mine pushed copper stocks higher. Freeport McMoran rose
4.7 per cent to $57.15, and Coeur d’Alene gained 4.9 per cent to $5.37.Technology stocks were down across the board. Amazon sank 3.4 per cent to $28.13. Yahoo dropped 3 per cent to $28.90. Google lost 1.6 per cent to $377.30. National Semiconductor dropped 4.9 per cent to $22.71 after Lehman Brothers cut its rating on the stock from “overweight” to “equal weight”.Chemicals and construction company Ashland dipped after it said it had agreed to sell its highway construction business to Irish construction group CRH for $1.3bn. Some investors had forecast a better price for the sale and shares fell 5.7 per cent to $62.55.Discount retailer Dollar General dropped 9.6 per cent to a three-year low of $12.74 after it lowered its earnings guidance for its fiscal second quarter."

Bob Nardelli, Home Depot’s chief executive, predicted a “challenging” second half.Tom Schoewe, Wal-Mart’s chief financial officer, said the group had achieved a slight increase in gross margins during the quarter as it kept labour costs flat, off-setting increased costs from higher utility bills for its stores.He also gave the first indication that Wal-Mart’s year-old revamp of its marketing and merchandising – aimed at persuading more customers to buy higher margin goods such as clothing and electronics – was beginning to show results.“Most importantly we’re seeing that market segmentation, better store design and improved merchandising are all paying off,” he said. “Initial margins, driven by general merchandising, are expanding.”Wal-Mart said it “continued to see progress” at its loss-making Seiyu stores in Japan, which again recorded positive sales growth and improved margins.It reported a decline in profit margins at its Asda unit in Britain, as it lowered prices to win market share. But it said total sales were above plan and that it was “encouraged” by Asda’s increase in market share.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index had its best day in more than six weeks. Nvidia surged 9.6 per cent to $25.52 and Broadcom rose 6.9 per cent to $27.91.Dell added 4 per cent to $22.08, and Apple Computer rose 3.9 per cent to $66.45. Google added 3.1 per cent to $380.97.Agilent Technologies, a maker of scientific equipment, jumped 9.3 per cent to $31.12 after it reported that profits in the fiscal third quarter had more than doubled, thanks to gains from selling assets.Software maker CA surged after its quarterly results beat analysts’ estimates and it announced a $2bn stock buy-back programme. Its shares jumped 6.8 per cent to $23.24.Juniper Networks gained 8.4 per cent to $13.49. The company said it would appeal against a decision by Nasdaq that it no longer met listing requirements on the exchange due to delays in releasing its quarterly financial report.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 1.4 per cent, or 17.37 points, at 1,285.58, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.2 per cent, or 45.97 points, at 2,115.01. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 per cent, or 132.39 points, at 11,230.26.Home improvement retailer Home Depot reported a modest rise in quarterly profits on Tuesday. Investors shrugged off lower quarterly sales guidance, and the company’s shares rose 3.6 per cent to $34.44.Wal-Mart shed 1.2 per cent to $44.55 after it said second- quarter earnings fell 25 per cent because of costs associated with the sale of its German operations. The company also gave third-quarter earnings guidance at the lower end of analysts’ forecasts.ExxonMobil was another stock that bucked the upward trend. Its shares dropped 0.8 per cent to $68.69 on news that it would be charged over an oil spill in Nova Scotia two years ago.Barr Pharmaceuticals announced that quarterly earnings nearly doubled thanks to increased sales of its proprietary drugs as well as generic products. The better-than-expected results pushed shares up 6.8 per cent to $55.85.Tribune, owner of the Chicago Cubs baseball team, ticked up 4.9 per cent to $31.24 on news that activist shareholder Nelson Peltz had bought a stake in the company.
457;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Stock options troubles: background;;Apple Computer may be the highest-profile but it is not the first company to admit that it would probably have to restate its earnings as a result of the widening stock options backdating scandal.McAfee, the security software company, said last month that manipulation of the timing of options meant it would have to restate earnings going back to at least 2003, and the impact would be significant. It also fired its general counsel as a result of the episode.Mercury Interactive, a business software company, was also forced to restate several years’ worth of earnings reports. Mercury’s shares were de-listed from the Nasdaq and its former chief executive resigned last November amid revelations that he and other executives had benefited from favourable backdating of stock options grants.San Francisco-based CNET Networks also said last month that it expected to restate financial statements.Last month, US authorities handed down the first criminal and civil charges in the scandal, charging three former executives of California technology company Brocade Communications Systems.The probe so far has been centred on but not limited to Silicon Valley technology companies. In June, Home Depot became the largest US company to acknowledge having awarded backdated stock options to executives after conducting an internal investigation like Apple and many other companies. The home improvement retailer said it had discovered $10m of unrecorded expenses resulting from five cases of retroactively priced stock options.In some cases, the scandal has prompted lawsuits from shareholders. UnitedHealth Group, the health insurer, has been hit with a suit from two Ohio public pension funds.So far, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating about 80 companies, but the probe could widen significantly. According to one published study conducted by Erik Lie, the University of Iowa finance professor whose research in 2004 helped spur the current set of probes, more than 2,000 companies appear to have used backdated options to boost executives’ income.Backdating involves the use of a grant date for a share option that comes before the date when the decision was made to award the option. This allowed the option to be backdated to when the awarding company’s share price was lower, increasing the potential profit for executives when the option is exercised.Investigators are looking into whether options were deliberately backdated to periods when a company’s stock price was at or near a record low and whether this was properly disclosed and accounted for.Most cases relate to a roughly six-year period prior to the introduction of Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. Before then, option grants were disclosed once a year and could be made in a 45-day window, which was cut to two days by the legislation, curbing the ability of managements to manipulate options grants.Christopher Cox , SEC chairman, has said the agency is considering adding fresh guidelines on stock-options disclosure to a landmark executive compensation reform proposal that he presented earlier this year.The proposals would provide shareholders with a total compensation number for the CEO, CFO and the three other highest-paid executive officers. That would require options to be disclosed in a “summary compensation table” at fair value on grant.The latest accounting standards mean a company cannot hide the true value of the option by fixing option terms on a date other than the true grant date.
458;HD;Home Depot;2006-07-28T20:18:13Z;FDIC declares moratorium on Wal-Mart bank;;Opponents of a bid by Wal-Mart and Home Depot, the US retailers, to offer an increased range of financial services have welcomed a decision by federal regulators to suspend any further moves on the issue for at least six months.The move postpones until after November’s congressional elections any decision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on the two retailers’ applications to operate state chartered industrial banks, also known as industrial loan corporations (ILCs).Wal-Mart says it wants the bank to reduce its back-office payment handling costs, while Home Depot wants to use Enerbank, which it acquired in May, to issue loans to finance home improvement loans.The applications have provoked bitter opposition from the banking industry, which argues that ILCs allow competitors to operate with a lighter regulatory burden than banks under the control of the Federal Reserve.The Fed has also argued that the rapid growth of state chartered industrial banks breaches federal laws separating banking and commerce.The FDIC said it would not approve any new ILCs, or any changes in ownership, or accept any new applications until after January 31.It said it took the decision to provide time to assess developments in the industry, and to see if the rapid growth of the sector raised new regulatory issues.The FDIC’s decision follows a letter sent to its board from almost 100 members of Congress, who asked for the delay while the House of Representatives considers a bill that would impose limits on ILC ownership.The bill, sponsored by House Democrat Barney Frank and Republican Paul Gilmore, is not expected to become law, even if it wins House approval.But it includes proposals to extend the powers of the FDIC, to give it the ability to assess not only the financial health of individual industrial banks, as at present, but of the bank and its owner. That would bring FDIC oversight more in line with the consolidated regulatory powers exercised over bank holding companies by the Federal Reserve.Mr Frank welcomed the moratorium, the most significant move by the FDIC under its recently appointed chairwoman, Sheila Bair, saying it “has taken the right step in giving Congress the ability to consider the implications of the increasing efforts to use ILC charters to avoid the long-standing separation of banking and commerce.”Currently, 61 industrial banks operate in seven states, owned both by financial services companies and by commercial groups including Volkswagen and BMW. There are nine applications for deposit insurance and five notices of change in control for existing ILCs pending before the FDIC.
459;HD;Home Depot;2006-07-24T19:57:15Z;Wolseley;;Nutritionists tend to recommend small snacks rather than large meals. Wolseley, the plumbing and building materials group, has taken this advice to heart. It has made 50 bite-sized acquisitions over the past year, worth a total of £900m. However, Wolseley sunk its teeth into a much larger meal on Monday, agreeing to buy DT Group, the Nordic building materials company, for £1.35bn, including debt.The timing of the deal could not be better. Wolseley has suffered in recent months from fears of a slowdown in the US housing market, where the company makes 58 per cent of its sales. Since 2000, Wolseley’s shares have had an 87 per cent correlation with US homebuilding figures, which have cooled and are expected to weaken further. Competition is also increasing in the US, where Wolseley has a leading position – Home Depot entered the market last year by buying Hughes Supply.After the purchase of DT, Wolseley’s dependence on the US market will decline to a still high, but more manageable, 51 per cent of sales. DT is the market leader in the Nordic region, an area growing faster than the rest of the European Union. This may justify Wolseley’s willingness to pay a princely 10.7 times enterprise value over earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation – at the upper end of recent deals in the sector.Although the deal is characteristically shrewd, it is unlikely to enable Wolseley to escape the cruel logic of a cooling global property market. Residential building growth in DT’s markets is expected to slow to just 0.6 per cent in 2008 from 6.7 per cent in 2005. The fastest growth over coming years looks likely to be seen in China and Eastern Europe. Wolseley may be willing to take larger bites but has so far shown little inclination to do more than sample such adventurous fare.
460;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Retail groups’ bank plans under attack;;The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday attacked moves by Wal-Mart, Home Depot and others to establish state-chartered banking operations, warning that the growth of the sector threatened to undermine congressional control of national banking policy.Scott Alvarez, Fed general counsel, said the issues were “becoming more acute in light of the remarkable recent growth and potential future expansion” of the sector. “The nation’s policies . . . are in danger of being decided for Congress through the expansion of this loophole by individual firms acting in their own self interest,” he told the House sub-committee on financial services.The hearing follows a year-long lobbying battle in Washington over a bid by Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, to open an industrial bank in Utah – in effect side-stepping federal banking laws that aim to separate banking and commerce.Home Depot, the second- largest US retailer, is also seeking approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for its takeover of Enerbank, a Utah-based industrial loan company (ILC).Several car companies – including Volkswagen and Toyota – use Utah ILCs to issue car and house financing, and to operate savings accounts, while Target, Wal-Mart’s main discount rival, used an ILC to issue credit cards.Mr Alvarez repeated the Fed’s criticisms of ILCs, which are not subject to its supervision but benefit from federal deposit insurance, arguing that the lighter regulatory burden on ILCs also created unfair competition for federally regulated banks.Douglas Jones, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s acting general counsel, said the ILCs had a “good safety and soundness track record to date”, and only represented 1.4 per cent of total banking assets.This year, the FDIC organised unprecedented public hearings on Wal-Mart’s bank application, which was opposed by banks and a range of the retailer’s critics.Wal-Mart, which says it wants the bank to reduce the costs of processing electronic payments, is now awaiting a decision on its licence.Home Depot’s application to take over Enerbank has also drawn opposition from the banking industry.The American Bankers Association says there is potential “for a direct and irreparable breach” of the wall dividing banking and commerce. Home Depot says it wants to use the bank to enable small contractors to offer loans to householders for home improvement.
461;HD;Home Depot;2006-06-23T18:41:19Z;Hispanics attract fancy footwork by advertisers;;US soccer fans have traditionally been poorly served. But they have had a new way of keeping up with events at this year’s World Cup – provided they don’t mind the commentary being in Spanish.Verizon, the wireless provider, has been broadcasting video clips of goals and key moments from each game to subscribers to its new V-cast service, under a deal with Univision, the broadcaster that holds the Spanish language rights in the US.That the deal is with Univision, rather than ABC, which holds the US English language rights to the matches, is just one sign of the unprecedented level of attention US companies and marketers are paying to this year’s tournament – seen as a way of wooing increasingly affluent Hispanic consumers.“Our market is maturing at light speed, and you’ve got more Fortune 500 companies involved than ever before, because right now our market is the bright spot for our industry,” says Alex Lopez Negrete, whose agency produces Spanish language advertising for Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer. US multinationals Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch and McDonalds are among FIFA’s official global sponsors, but much of their marketing effort has been traditionally focused outside the US.But more leading US companies than ever have spent money this year on domestic TV advertising campaigns linked to the tournament, focused firmly on the Latino market that is expected to account for about 10 per cent of US consumer spending by 2010. Official figures estimate that Hispanic communities will make up nearly a quarter of the total US population by 2050.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has launched its first World Cup-related advertising campaign, with the catchline “Pasion por el futbol”, while Best Buy, the home electronics retailer, has launched a campaign focused on its TV products.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer that sponsors the US national football team, is also backing Univision’s match coverage, along with McNeil’s Tylenol and Allstate Insurance. But Home Depot is also facing off against a line of TV commercials from its main rival Lowes, which began supporting a national championship for amateur Hispanic teams in 2003.Some companies, such as Verizon, have also sought to use the World Cup to launch integrated marketing campaigns focused on the Hispanic community.Best Buy has also launched a bilingual online football competition with Impremedia, which publishes Spanish language newspapers and magazines. McDonald’s – which is only doing TV World Cup advertising in Spanish – is also pursuing a regionalised marketing strategy, with restaurants in New York and Los Angeles, which both have substantial Latino populations, featuring World Cup meals that include souvenir World Cup plastic cup and a dolce de leche sundae dessert.Wal-Mart has also launched football-themed marketing events at stores with significant Hispanic customers, with 155 stores participating in events that include setting up Astroturf football fields in the parking lots for bilingual coaching.For Wal-Mart, the World Cup effort ties into a broader move to deepen its relationship with its Hispanic customers through a programme of store-customisation.Lee Scott, its chief executive, said this year that sales at its stores with a dominant Hispanic customer base increased more than 9 per cent last year, against overall sales growth of about 3 per cent. “Right now, Hispanics have a greater affinity for Wal-Mart than any identifiable segment of the US population.”Univision, which holds World Cup rights up to 2014 under a $425m deal reached with Fifa last year, has been reporting strong audience viewing figures, with Nielsen National Television index reporting it as outperforming ABC and ESPN2 by more than 11 per cent. The company has made the potential of the rights a leading part of its pitch during its current auction.The first-round performance of the US team, meanwhile, remained largely an afterthought for most Americans.With the US already ejected, it’s just as well the marketing has had an Hispanic focus.Additional reporting by Elizabeth Rigby
462;HD;Home Depot;2006-06-16T22:04:30Z;Home Depot ensnared in options scandal;;Home Depot has become the largest US company to acknowledge having awarded backdated stock options to executives, extending the scandal further beyond the technology sector where the controversial practice was most common.The home improvement retailer said it had discovered $10m of unrecorded expenses resulting from five cases of retroactively priced stock options.More than 40 US companies have been exposed for manipulating the exercise price of stock options to increase their value to executives.Home Depot is the best-known name to have become embroiled in the scandal, attracting fresh scrutiny to its corporate governance at a time when the company was already under fire over soaring executive pay.All five cases of backdating occurred before 2000, when Bob Nardelli, the current chief executive, took charge.The company did not disclose who had received the backdated options but said its billionaire founders, Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank, were not involved.An official said the company had made the find in the course of a voluntary internal investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission was not involved.“Home Depot is committed to high standards of corporate governance and transparency in its reporting practices and, as such, conducted a review of its stock option grant practices and procedures since 1996,” the company said, in a statement.Other large companies caught up in the scandal include UnitedHealth Group, the health insurer, and Juniper Networks, the telecommunications equipment company.Backdating involves the use of a grant date for a share option that comes before the date when the decision was made to award the option.This allowed the option to be backdated to when the awarding company’s share price was lower, increasing the potential profit for executives when the option is exercised.Home Depot said that in three of the five cases, the company’s share price was higher on the award date than on the date when the exercise price was set.Backdating is not necessarily illegal but the practice has forced several companies to restate earnings and sparked probes by the SEC and the Justice Department because stock option expenses were not properly disclosed.Home Depot said its $10m of unrecorded expenses were not great enough to merit a restatement.But its involvement in backdating is an acute embarrassment for the company, coming weeks after it faced a shareholder rebellion over the nearly $250m of compensation awarded to Mr Nardelli over the past six years.Most cases of backdating occurred before the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which aimed to improve corporate governance in the US.Christopher Cox, chairman of the SEC, is considering adding fresh guidelines on stock option disclosure to a landmark executive compensation reform proposal he presented earlier this year.
463;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
464;HD;Home Depot;2006-06-15T19:08:56Z;US investors are now less content to hail the chief;;When Bob Nardelli was appointed chief executive of Home Depot in December 2000, it seemed like a consolation prize. He had just lost out to Jeffrey Immelt in the battle to succeed Jack Welch as chief executive of General Electric.Six years later, the setback is starting to look like a stroke of luck. Since taking charge of Home Depot, the world’s largest do-it-yourself retailer, Mr Nardelli has received nearly $250m (£135m, €198m) in compensation including stock options – more than double what Mr Immelt has been paid at GE.The package triggered an investor revolt that stunned Home Depot and has put Mr Nardelli at the centre of a spreading controversy about soaring executive compensation in the US.After decades of meekly accepting gigantic executive pay packages in North Korea-style annual votes, investors are challenging executives to prove that their performance warrants huge pay cheques. “Executive compensation has absolutely skyrocketed to the number one issue shareholders are concerned about,” says Carolyn Brancato, director of the Global Corporate Governance Center at the Conference Board, a research organisation.With regulators and politicians also threatening to act unless companies rein back, executive compensation has become the new front in the battle for better corporate governance in the US.The current season of shareholder meetings has seen several blue-chip companies – such as Pfizer, AT&T, Merrill Lynch and Wal-Mart – suffer the wrath of shareholders over executive compensation. On Wednesday, Country­wide Financial, a California mortgage group, came under pressure at its annual meeting from shareholders led by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) pension plan, which called for a say in the level of executive pay at the company.Across the country, investors’ concerns have been deepened by a scandal over the backdating of stock options – once considered the fairest way to provide incentives for executives – that has ensnared some 40 companies in a tangle of investigations, earnings restatements and lawsuits. Last month it emerged that dozens of companies had made retroactive options grants to executives just before rises in the companies’ share prices.The suspicion among angry shareholders is that such moves were not properly disclosed and accounted for. The result has been a battery of lawsuits against companies and executives from public pension funds, which claim that something has gone seriously awry with executive compensation.The Securities and Exchange Commission has moved quickly to address the allegations. It may incorporate further stock options disclosure into an existing executive compensation overhaul being conducted by Christopher Cox, the agency’s chairman.Some executives warn that the US corporate psyche still bears the scars of the regulatory backlash that followed the Enron and WorldCom scandals and can ill afford another raft of onerous corporate governance regulations. “If they keep hitting us with rules, we will never be able to focus on getting our companies to do better and make more money for shareholders,” complains one chief executive.But if the climate of unease intensifies, the focus on executive pay, just like the corporate scandals that preceded it, could change the way US companies are run and held accountable. “We are in the midst of a paradigm shift in the US. There is a chance for boards to take companies’ driving seats away from senior management,” says Patrick McGurn at Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises more than 1,600 fund managers.Part of the reason for rising anger over executive pay is that, in absolute terms, America’s corporate chieftains have never had it so good.The typical chief executive of one of America’s top 350 companies received $6.8m in salary, bonus, options and other benefits last year – more than double what they would have earned 10 years ago, according to Mercer Human Resource Consulting. The biggest-earning 25 per cent of executives, who tend to run the larger groups, earned more than $12m on average.These pay levels are about twice what the head of a company of similar size makes in Europe. They are also 431 times the average wage for a production worker, according to another survey (see chart) – a hugely sensitive issue at a time when many Americans live in fear of losing their jobs to cheaper foreign labour.It is this growing disparity that leads many experts to believe the current furore over executive compensation will not abate soon. The confluence of corporate scandals, volatile stock markets and tougher economic conditions for average Americans means the issue is reverberating far beyond the financial world, affecting public opinion throughout the US.Yet the pay rises of today pale in comparison to the eye-watering awards handed out during the internet bubble, when total compensation for chief executives rose more than 24 per cent. By contrast, their total pay between 2002 and last year increased by 5 per cent and the base salary of chief executives only rose 3.6 per cent – in line with workers’ wages.But the numbers tell only part of the story. Unlike their British counterparts, for example, US shareholders and public opinion have rarely been outraged by the large amounts earned by chief executives.The US entrepreneurial culture, admiration for winners and belief that wealth breeds wealth, spared corporate America from popular outcries such as the “fat cats” controversy that engulfed the people who ran Britain’s privatised utilities in the early 1990s.Shareholders’ fury has been stoked by the realisation that executive pay has not been accompanied by improvements in share price and performance. “Shareholders are not opposed to generous compensation when merited,” says Paul Hodgson, analyst at the Corporate Library, which monitors corporate governance in the US. “The complaint against Home Depot is that compensation has been so far out of step with performance.”This divergence has called into question the traditional rationale for large pay awards – that huge monetary incentives reward executives for making money for shareholders. Shares in six of the 10 companies whose chief executives received the highest rises in total compensation in 2005 under­performed their peers over the previous five years, according to the Corporate Library.At a bellwether such as AT&T, Ed Whitacre, chairman and chief executive, has received more than $34m over the past two years despite the fact that total shareholder value fell by more than 40 per cent in the 2000-05 period.Much of the blame for the failure to give shareholders bang for their buck has been pinned on stock options. Once regarded as a spur to chief executives’ performance, options’ limitations have been cruelly exposed by recent events.By linking future compensation to share price increases, options have the glaring drawback of rewarding executives for stock market gains that have got nothing to do with them. If, according to an old traders’ saying, a rising tide lifts all boats, then America’s corporate captains have been riding high on the crest of the long bull market.In theory, executives should be exposed to the risk of a fall in the value of the shares, but in practice many companies have repriced options after a market setback. The backdating scandal has additionally raised the spectre of executives blithely awarding themselves options knowing these were profitable almost from the grant date.If, as one chief executive puts it, the scandal has confounded the long-held perception that excessive pay is a “victimless crime”, who is the perpetrator?Some observers blame a culture of “superstar chief executives” for spurring a remuneration “arms race”. But although the fictional Gordon Gekko’s “greed is good” creed still resonates in corporate America’s corner offices, most observers agree that the onus to contain boardroom excesses rests with the independent directors on boards’ compensation committees.According to Norman Veasey, a former chief justice in the Supreme Court of Delaware, the state where most US big companies are incorporated, “directors who are supposed to be independent should have the guts to be a pain in the neck”.But academic and empirical evidence suggests that this ideal can be difficult to realise, given the ties between independent directors and management. Professors Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, who analysed the issue in their book Pay Without Performance, concluded: “Compensation arrangements have often deviated from arm’s length contracting because directors have been influenced by management, sympathetic to executives, insufficiently motivated to bargain over compensation or simply ineffective.”With human factors making it difficult for directors to challenge management – and no prospect of America embracing a UK-style division of roles between chairman and chief executive – the answer may lie in the details of executive compensation.Some experts argue that traditional stock options should be adjusted to “filter” the effects of stock market movements unrelated to company’s performance. Others suggest companies should issue options at a premium, rather than at the market price, so executives have to sweat for their millions.Corporate governance experts also bemoan the use of the same targets for both annual and long-term bonuses, arguing that executives get paid twice for the same achievement.Several large fund managers privately advocate replacing crude measures such as revenue and earnings with yardsticks closely linked to shareholder value. The SEC’s Mr Cox, meanwhile, is focusing forthcoming reforms on disclosure. He proposes telling compensation committees to release all material information regarding their decisions – “and we mean all”, he says.A company would provide one number that includes all compensation to top executives in a given year. The different elements that make up that number would be presented “not in an impenetrable thicket of details”, but in clearly presented tables. “The principle here is simple,” Mr Cox says. “No shareholder should need a machete and a pith helmet to go hunting for what the CEO makes.”Whatever the structure of executive compensation, the leaders of corporate America are unlikely to be able to enjoy the fruits of their labour in quite the same way in future.Recent events suggest that more and more investors agree with Warren Buffett, who is paid just $100,000 a year. Nearly three years ago he wrote: “In judging whether corporate America is serious about reforming itself, CEO pay remains the acid test. To date, the results aren’t encouraging.”‘It’s insane, the amount that Lee Raymond got’For the first time in years, investor anger at executive pay on Wall Street is spilling into Main Street, writes Melissa Korn.Small investors interviewed by the Financial Times in New York this week expressed outrage at the size of chief executives’ remuneration packages at a time of volatile share prices and rising mortgage rates.However, none planned to sell their stakes in companies with generous board compensation schemes – at least while share prices kept rising.Steve Schulman, casually dressed and trading while on his lunch break, branded high executive salaries “immoral” and “criminal”.Outside a Manhattan branch of TD Ameritrade, the retail brokerage, Mr Schulman drew unflattering comparisons between the performance of shares he owns in Exxon, the US energy giant, and the rewards reaped by Lee Raymond, its former chief executive, who received a package of $168m (£91m, €133m) when he retired last year. “It’s insane, the amount of compensation that he got.”Mr Schulman’s comments were echoed by other foot soldiers in the army of US retail investors, many of whom go to great lengths to indulge their passion for stocks. Miriam Newman, in her 80s and so interested in the markets that she often records business television shows for fear of missing analysts’ recommendations, did not pull her punches. “I’m upset with people who make money without earning it,” she said. “That [takes] a whole lot of nerve.”Yet Mrs Newman, a frequent trader, said she would not pull out of companies just because their executives netted large amounts of money. “My husband and I feel that if the company is doing well and we’re making money on the stock, then we don’t really care.”Mrs Newman, who owns about 800 shares in Home Depot, said the $3m annual bonus guaranteed to Robert Nardelli, chief executive, was “outrageous” but acknowledged she had made a handsome profit on the shares of the home-improvement chain over the past decade.Dave Grossman, a young investor based in midtown Manhattan who was also spending his lunch hour at TD Ameritrade, likened chief executives of large companies to star baseball players, who earn multimillion-dollar pay cheques even if they underperform in key games.“It doesn’t stop me investing or watching a game but I do think it’s ridiculous,” he declared.THE BACKDATING GAME: YOU’RE INSTANTLY IN THE MONEYWhat is stock-options backdating?Selecting a grant date for a share option that comes before the date when the decision was made to award the option, usually because the stock price was lower on the earlier date.Can this be legal?Frowned on by corporate governance experts, certainly. Even the Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of the largest US companies, “discouraged” it in 2003. But backdating itself is not a violation of securities laws.So what is all the fuss about?The problems arise when there has been no proper disclosure and expensing of “in-the-money” options.If a company deviated from its options plan, it would have to disclose that. Also, if company records were altered in the process, the company and executives could be open to charges of falsification.Now to expensing.US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles do not forbid companies to issue in-the-money stock options. But they must expense the excess of the market price of the stock over the option exercise price.The suspicion is that this was often not done, hiding from shareholders how executives were being compensated – and violating securities laws in the process.Is this sort of thing still happening?Unlikely. Most current cases seem to relate to a roughly six-year period before the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. Until then, options grants were disclosed only yearly in proxies and in form 5s, filed with the SEC within 45 days of a year-end.Much of the backdating seems to have occurred within that window, narrowed to two days by Sox. This curbed the ability of managements to manipulate options grants.Surely auditors and legal counsel must have signed off on these practices?It depends what they knew and were told. But it is safe to assume that the investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice are unlikely to ignore their role.What is the SEC doing about backdating?Christopher Cox , chairman, says the agency is considering adding fresh guidelines on stock-options disclosure to a landmark executive compensation reform proposal that he presented earlier this year.The proposals would provide shareholders with a total compensation number for the CEO, CFO and the three other highest-paid executive officers. That would require options to be disclosed in a “summary compensation table” at fair value on grant.Latest accounting standards mean a company cannot hide the true value of the option by fixing option terms on a date other than the true grant date.Q&A by Jeremy GrantSources: SEC, Bear Stearns, Covington & Burling
465;HD;Home Depot;2006-06-14T20:33:14Z;Lex: US banking services;;One of the hazards of vilifying one foe is that it makes it harder to portray the next as equally wicked. Take commercial bankers, who mustered an impressive range of allies earlier this year to try to stop Wal-Mart from invading their turf. By comparison, resistance against Home Depot’s plan to buy a small banking operation has so far proven rather feeble.From a public policy perspective, that looks surprising. After all, Wal-Mart’s application to set up an Industrial Loan Company to handle its back-office payment processing was mainly intended to reduce its costs – and to pass on the savings to customers.As the Federal Reserve keeps pointing out, the growth of such state-chartered quasi-banks raises some questions about how best to supervise them and their commercial owners. After all, ILCs benefit from federal insurance on deposits. But while mighty Wal-Mart may be a scary competitor, its very size makes it hard to object on solvency grounds, not least since Wal-Mart’s rival Target and several carmakers already own ILCs.By contrast, Home Depot is keen to buy an ILC that relies on trade contractors to refer new customers for home improvement loans. Conceivably, the purchase could distort competition among home improvement stores, as contractors might have an extra incentive to shop at Home Depot.Revealingly, however, few rival retailers have raised objections. Instead, much of the opposition comes from banks – and realtors worried that if the growth of ILCs continues, banks might be allowed into real-estate brokerage. Unfortunately for customers, that appears as unlikely for now as retailers offering a full range of banking services. Given the record profits banks made over the past few years, however, new sources of competition are exactly what a sound regulator should expect – and encourage.
466;HD;Home Depot;2006-06-08T16:02:21Z;Monaco diary: Lessons from Wayne’s world;;Monaco diary: Jonathan Guthrie reports from the Entrepreneur of the Year World SummitIn Monaco, it is possible for the owner of a $10m leisure craft to feel financially inadequate while tying up among the floating Krug palaces in the harbour. Not a bad venue, therefore, for an event that brings together heavyweight wealth creators from 32 countries, including Home Depot founder Arthur Blank, laptop tycoon Barry Lam and Stelios of EasyGroup.This is the Entrepreneur of the Year World Summit, organised by professional services firm Ernst & Young. Now in its sixth year, it combines an awards contest with a conference and claims to be the “Davos of enterprise”. But I have yet to spot Bono or that actress with lips resembling a startled sea anemone.However, this morning I did catch up with Wayne Huizenga, the extraordinary serial entrepreneur who was World Entrepreneur of the Year in 2005. Mr Huizenga is the only person in corporate history to have built up and floated six companies on the NYSE, three of which made it into the Fortune 500.Probably best known as the man behind the Blockbuster entertainment chain, Mr Huizenga said he had been “lucky”. This sounded a bit like false modesty. At one stage Blockbuster, which Viacom eventually bought for $8.5bn, was opening a store every 17 hours. Mr Huizenga later founded AutoNation, the car retailer now capitalised at $8bn, and Republic Services, a waste business worth around $9bn.The deal he professed himself most tickled by was the $55m purchase of the Florida Panthers, an ice hockey team which he later sold for $88m. No great shakes, you might think – except that he used shares in the Panthers to buy five hotels he later sold for $1.3bn, making a hefty profit.“We are never smarter than the competition, so if we want to grow twice as fast we have to work twice as hard,” said Mr Huizenga of his vehicle Huizenga Holdings, adding: “No-one ever drowned in their own sweat.” He also quoted two rules of business espoused by Jack Welch, formerly of General Electric: “Rule One: never lose money. Rule Two: do not forget rule one.”Mr Huizenga made his billions through service innovation in established industries. Blockbuster benefited from growth in VCR ownership, he told FT.com, “but there were already 25,000 video stores [in the US] when we started, so we built bigger, better stores with a bigger range of titles and did not rent out adult movies”. With AutoNation he released value trapped in the cosy relationships between privately owned car dealers and big manufacturers, sharing it with customers.Earlier Thursday morning, Erich Joachimstaler, chief executive of Vivaldi Partners, a branding consultancy, told delegates that “it’s OK to be disliked”. His point was that branding in crowded markets should be about differentiation. One of his illustrations was a Harley-Davidson ad showing a biker’s back emblazoned with the slogan “if you can read this the bitch fell off”. Um, yes. Crikey.Mr Joachimstaler quoted this comment from Harley: “What we sell is the ability of a 43-year-old accountant to ride through a small town in black leather and have people feel afraid of him.” According to the consultant, companies need “to explore brand as a personality or a belief system”. Mr Joachimstaler – an ex-pat German living in New York – cited efforts by Germany to shed some brand associations as “safe”, “confident”, “arrogant” and “cold close”. The target perceptions were “flexible”, “warm”, “tactful”, and “spontaneous”. Perhaps Germany is reserving “hilarious sense of humour” for Phase Two.Chris Patten, rather than the powerful air conditioning at the Grimaldi Forum building, sent a cold draft down the back of European delegates’ necks earlier in the day. The former UK government minister, diplomat and EU Commissioner gave a realistically chilly assessment of the state of the EU. Progress on the Lisbon Agenda, an ambitious plan to make it “the most dynamic economy in the world by 2010”, had been “patchy though not non-existent”, Lord Patten said.Improvements have been on the North West fringe, he said, in the UK, Ireland and Nordic countries, while progress has been poor in Germany, France and Italy. In France the international competitiveness of its businesses was at sharp odds with the country’s growing protectionism, Lord Patten said. French politicians appeared to believe they could “protect against global competition by [shielding the food group] Danone as they once attempted to shield themselves militarily with the Maginot Line.”There was little chance, Lord Patten suggested, of the EU closing its growth gap with the US, partly because while “Americans take risks, Europeans take holidays”. Annoyingly for politicians, EU citizens use little of that time to reproduce, thereby constraining labour supply and straining retirement systems. Lord Patten did not push the point, but the conclusion is that west Europeans have reason to feel grateful for those oft-resented Polish plumbers, Algerian fruit pickers and Indian IT specialists.Paul Ostling, chief operating officer of E&Y, pointed out that the EU is not the only economic power facing a demographic crisis. China will too, in time. A survey published on Thursday by E&Y shows that the unwillingness of Europeans to make babies has meanwhile failed to dent foreign direct investment. The lightly regulated, euro-free UK proved to be the most popular destination.
467;HD;Home Depot;2006-05-17T00:07:06Z;Home Depot hit by news of controversial change;;Shares in Home Depot fell 5 per cent on Tuesday as investors expressed alarm at sluggish retail sales and a controversial change in the way the company reports results.The home improvement retailer said it would no longer disclose same-store sales – which is a closely watched performance measure – in its quarterly financial statements.Same-store sales comparisons are used throughout the retail industry as a way to judge a company’s performance without the impact of new store openings.Home Depot said it was abandoning the measure to reflect the company’s diversification beyond consumer retailing into a broader range of businesses aimed at professional contractors.But analysts feared the change was an attempt to mask weakness in the core retail business and avoid unfavourable comparisons with Lowe’s, the second largest US home improvement retailer, which has been outperforming Home Depot recently.The dispute over same-store sales overshadowed broadly positive first-quarter results, with net profits up 19 per cent to $1.5bn, or 70 cents a share – better than Wall Street’s consensus forecast of 67 cents a share.But lower-than-expected sales from the company’s flagship do-it-yourself chain stoked concern that a slowdown in the US housing market combined with rising fuel prices and interest rates was depressing consumer spending.Carol Tome, chief financial officer, insisted that the slowdown in retail sales was mostly because of unusually wet weather on the US west coast, which had deterred consumers from starting DIY projects.“We do not see a direct correlation to broader economic factors,” she said.Total sales were up 13 per cent at $21.5bn, helped by a tripling in revenues from the supply division.
468;HD;Home Depot;2006-05-16T20:46:33Z;Wall Street down as data vies with earnings;;Wall Street closed down on Tuesday paring advances made earlier in the day as disappointing results from retailers combined with anxiety about inflation, despite the release of relatively benign economic data.Stocks in focus included Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Staples.The US producer price index rose 0.9 per cent in April, fuelled by higher energy and commodity prices. However, the core PPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.1 per cent, less than had been forecast, giving some comfort to investors who had feared the data could add pressure on the Federal Reserve to ratchet up interest rates.“The market was up on the fact that the core rate of inflation was lower than expected, but the higher number was still a scary number,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach.Separately, data on new housing starts showed the pace of new home building dropped to its slowest since November 2004, adding to the gloom from a report on Monday showing declining confidence among homebuilders.“The housing market was one of the strong performers of the economy. We are now seeing it weaken and that’s one of the reasons why the market is softer,” said Mr Cardillo.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent or 2.42 points, at 1,292.08, while the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.4 per cent, or 9.39 points, to 2,229.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent, or 8.88 points, at 11,419.89.Wal-Mart nudged up 1.4 per cent to $48.07 after it announced a 6 per cent rise in quarterly profit. The results, above Wall Street forecasts, offset a warning from the world’s largest retailer that high energy prices could affect results for this quarter.In spite of Wal-Mart’s advances, retail was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500. Home Depot reported a 19 per cent increase in first-quarter profit, but shares fell 5.1 per cent to $38.45, after the home-improvement retailer said it was “disappointed” with its core retail sales.Staples slid 6.1 per cent to $24.82. Although quarterly profits rose strongly, investors took fright at sluggish same-store sales that rose 1 per cent, the slowest rate in three years.The company’s stock has lagged rivals Office Max and Office Depot, which have added 69 per cent and 38 per cent respectively this year. Prior to Tuesday’s fall, Staples had gained 16 per cent for the year and is now up only 9 per cent.Litigation threats rattled Apple Computer. Singapore-based Creative Labs filed a suit against Apple for infringing the patent on its Zen brand of digital music player. Apple fell 4.2 per cent to $64.98.Carnival sank 8.5 per cent to $42.60 in heavy trading after it cut its earnings per share estimates for 2006.
469;HD;Home Depot;2006-05-12T17:30:13Z;Best Buy buys stake in Chinese group;;Best Buy, the US consumer electronics group, on Friday announced its first foreign acquisition outside North America when it said it would pay $180m for a majority stake in Chinese retailer Five Star Appliance.The deal gives Best Buy a foothold in the Chinese consumer electronics market, which is growing at a rapid rate but becoming dominated by a handful of local chains with aggressive expansion plans.Best Buy already has plans to open its own store in a popular shopping area of Shanghai, but the acquisition of Five Star, which has 136 stores and is the fourth-largest chain in the country, gives the US group a chance of competing with the local chains.The Chinese consumer electronics market has been growing at about 15 per cent a year, fuelled by the rapid expansion of the country’s middle class, and sales reached about $55bn last year. By 2010, sales are expected to reach $100bn, Best Buy said.The biggest local chain is Gome, which has about 450 stores and plans to add about 200 this year.During the recent May week holiday, alone, Suning, the second-largest chain, opened 21 new stores in one of the most dramatic examples of the way the biggest companies are trying to establish dominant positions. Suning plans to have 300 stores by the end of the year.In the past year, consumer electronics chains in China have begun to turn their attention to second and third-tier cities, many of which they believe now have enough consumers with the purchasing power to buy their products.Best Buy said the deal had been approved by the Chinese authorities and would be completed in June. Founded in 1998 in the eastern city of Nanjing as a wholesale business, Five Star only opened its first store in 2001. The company had revenues of nearly $700m in 2005, an increase of 50 per cent on the year before. Founder Wang Jianguo will remain chairman of the board and the Five Star stores will continue to operate under their own brand name.Best Buy said last month it had leased four floors of the Jiangshan building in the Xujiahui shopping district of Shanghai, which would become the company’s showcase store in China for its own brand.The company is one of a number of US retailers seeking a presence in China. Home Depot, the second-largest US retailer after Wal-Mart, has been in talks to acquire a stake in Orient Home, one of China’s largest home improvement retailers.Saks Fifth Avenue, the luxury department store, announced plans last month to open its first store in China in Shanghai in 2008 under a licensing deal. Gap, the leading US clothing retailer, said last year it was examining strategies for expansion in China.The company has this year launched a series of franchising deals in southeast Asia and the Middle East that analysts believe could be a model for introducing its branded stores into China.
470;HD;Home Depot;2006-05-12T15:37:19Z;Lunch with the FT: She’s the one;;You nailed the guy. You nailed him good. Is he gonna resign?” exclaims a large luncher at the table by the door as Maria Bartiromo steps into San Pietro.The luncher is Ken Langone, billionaire co-founder of Home Depot. The guy she “nailed” is Ben Bernanke, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve. And Bartiromo is the talk of the town, even more than usual.A few days before she had rocked the markets when she reported on her CNBC television show some comments Bernanke had made to her at a dinner in Washington. According to Bartiromo, Bernanke said the market reaction to his recent congressional testimony on the US central bank’s interest rate policy had been wrong.Before she had even finished her report, the markets went into a spin, the Dow Jones index dropping 70 points within minutes. The more lasting damage may be to Bernanke’s reputation as he tries to establish himself as a worthy successor to Alan Greenspan. But the scoop has only enhanced the reputation of Bartiromo, possibly the best-known business journalist in the world.After a laugh with Langone, Bartiromo is shown to one of the best tables in the house, which has miraculously become available despite a mix-up over the booking.I am the envy of Wall Street. Sitting at a corner table in San Pietro with Maria Bartiromo, the Sophia Loren of financial journalism. The restaurant is a big Wall Street hang-out, and I detect a few quizzical glances. “Who’s that with Maria? Don’t recognise him. Maybe he’s that new hedge fund guy,” I fondly imagine them saying.After the waiter has given us an interminable list of specials, I press Bartiromo on the Bernanke affair.She points out that Bernanke’s comments were heard not just by her but also by Bob Hormats, vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs, and another journalist. This, she implies, deals with the suggestion that they might have been off-the-record or inadvertent. She adds that Bernanke had carefully avoided answering a number of “tough questions” from Hormats.“When he said the markets got it wrong, I was taken aback, a little,” she says, but admits she was very surprised by the market reaction to her report. She declines to speculate on Bernanke’s motives but says he was clearly worried that the markets thought he was soft on interest rates. “I think that the market today has a clearer idea.”After ordering - sole for her, veal ravioli for me - we talk about how she made her name as the first reporter to broadcast live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for her daily slots on CNBC. For 10 years, she shouted out the market news, the winners and losers, the analysts’ buys and sells (mainly buys of course) from the colourful bedlam of the world’s largest stock exchange, frequently jostled (sometimes deliberately) by traders on the floor.“When I first got there it was tough. Nobody had done it before. And there were a lot of people who didn’t want me there. They said to themselves: ‘Who is this person? She has a camera, she is a woman, she’s in my way.’”But Bartiromo stood her ground, sometimes jostling the traders back. The viewers, and many of the traders, loved it. “I think people rooted for me.”It’s a particularly exposed form of television, and she believes this is partly why many viewers feel a personal connection with her. “The camera’s very transparent. Whether you liked me or not, you knew what you were getting and it was me.”At one stage she was doing a show in the morning, a show in the afternoon and a show at nine o’clock at night. “They are waking up with me and they are going to bed with me and I love that.”Bartiromo is known for her hard work, on-screen and off. She also writes columns for BusinessWeek and Reader’s Digest and has just started doing personal-finance slots on radio. “But I’m lucky because I love it. I love business news. And I love talking to smart and successful business people.”She admits she would struggle with the workload and says she is lucky to have a very supportive husband in Jonathan Steinberg, son of financier Saul Steinberg, a former magazine publisher who is now launching a family of exchange traded funds.The daughter of a Brooklyn restaurateur, Bartiromo, now 38, studied journalism and economics at New York University before joining CNN Business News. She then moved to CNBC in 1993, and by the late 1990s, the Money Honey, as the tabloids dubbed her, had become one of the faces of the stockmarket boom. Along with other CNBC reporters, she was subsequently criticised for contributing to the irrational exuberance of the bubble. “Journalists everywhere could have done a better job being sceptical. At the same time, I don’t know whether anyone would have listened. I don’t know.”She denies that CNBC’s coverage these days is “encouraging people to get in and out of individual stocks” and states firmly: “I am not a fan of day trading.”I ask about Mad Money, CNBC’s manic stock-advice programme presented by the former hedge-fund manager Jim Cramer. “The ratings are good, and that indicates that there is a day-trading community out there,” she says, and leaves it at that.In her early days reporting from the NYSE floor, Bartiromo got great support from women viewers and the few women at the exchange.But, let’s face it, her most devoted fans tend to be men. Few have been more devoted or shown their devotion more publicly than Joey Ramone, lead singer of the New York punk band, the Ramones.Bartiromo started receiving e-mails from someone calling himself Joey Ramone in 1998. Unsurprisingly, she was at first sceptical that it was the Joey Ramone. The e-mails would say things like: “Maria, I saw you on CNBC today, and you were talking about Intel. I own Intel but I feel they’re losing market share to AMD. Call me. Joey Ramone.” Could this really be the man responsible for such classics as “Sheena is a Punk Rocker”, “Teenage Lobotomy” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue”?“I finally e-mailed him back, and it was him, and we started having this great friendship about the markets. He was so informed and so intelligent about the markets. A really good investor.”But, for Ramone, there was clearly more than the markets to the friendship because when his solo album appeared shortly after his death from cancer in 2001, it included a love song entitled “Maria Bartiromo”. The uncharacteristically lyrical number’s chorus goes: “I watch you on the TV every single day./Those eyes make everything okay./I watch her every day./I watch her every night./She’s really outta sight.”“After he passed away, so many of the band members and friends called me and said: ‘Joey loved you.’”Bartiromo admits that her own musical tastes are more Frank Sinatra than Joey Ramone, and her husband accuses her of being uncool. “I say, no I’m not. Joey Ramone wrote a song about me. It doesn’t matter how many times I listen to Shirley Bassey - I’m cool.”Bartiromo’s eyes are mentioned as often as her scoops, and she doesn’t deny that her looks helped get her where she is. “But when it comes to a person’s looks in this business, it’s certainly not going to keep you there. At the end of the day you’ve got to have the goods. You can’t fool my viewers. They are the smartest and most informed people on the planet.”On the other hand, she also loves the glamour. “I’m a girls’ girl. I like fashion. I like getting my hair done,” she says, looking very glamorous but businesslike in a Gucci suit and Manolo Blahnik shoes with a Bulgari bag.She is taken very seriously by many top figures on Wall Street. John Thain, former president of Goldman Sachs and now chief executive of the NYSE, says her column is the first thing he turns to in BusinessWeek.And she has interviewed almost all the leading names in US business, some several times. They say yes, in part, she says, because she is not out to trap her subject: “I’m looking for articulate answers to the issues of the day.”Of her many interview coups, she points to those with Hank Greenberg, the former head of American International Group, the world’s biggest insurance company. These included one shortly after the board ousted him, under pressure from Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general.Bartiromo is close to a number of people targeted by Spitzer - including Dick Grasso, former chief executive of the NYSE, and our fellow diner Ken Langone, and others who have accused the attorney general of abusing his power. “In the case of Hank Greenberg a lot of people said [Spitzer] was the judge, the jury and the executioner,” she says. “Power can be abused. Having said that I think he’s done a tremendous job. He’s really cleaned things up.”Spitzer is one of the people Bartiromo would love to interview again, along with Rupert Murdoch. Unfortunately Murdoch is loyal to News Corporation’s Fox News and its chief, Roger Ailes. “I asked him to do my show again but he said: ‘I can’t. Roger Ailes would be mad.’”Fox is due to launch a rival business channel to CNBC later this year, and there has been some speculation that Bartiromo might jump ship. But asked whether she has talked to Fox, she says only that her CNBC contract runs to 2008. She also questions whether there is room for another business channel.Under her current contract, CNBC is committed to help her set up her own production company which she hopes will produce some documentaries. Looking further out, she would love to do a show examining the big issues of the day, whatever they are, without losing her special interest in business.By this time we have waited for at least 15 minutes for coffee, and a very apologetic Bartiromo says she really has to go. “I’m on screen at three.”On her way out, she has another exchange with Langone, who pleads with her not to do a Bernanke on him. I am left to pay the check and to savour a last few minutes as the man lunching with Maria Bartiromo.David Wighton is the FT’s New York bureau chief.Ristorante San Pietro, 18 East 54th Street, New York1 x Dover sole1 x veal ravioli1 x mineral water3 x coffeeTotal: $119.21
471;HD;Home Depot;2006-05-09T21:06:16Z;Home Depot buys bank to offer financial services;;Home Depot, the second biggest US retailer, is seeking to expand into the direct provision of financial services with the acquisition of EnerBank, a small industrial bank based in Utah.The move comes amid renewed concern in the banking industry over the use of state-chartered industrial banks by commercial companies to offer loans and other services, prompted largely by the bid by Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, to open a Utah bank similar to EnerBank.EnerBank, which began operations in March 2002, currently offers unsecured home improvement loans of $10,000 to $25,000 to home owners using referrals from contractors, and currently has net loan assets of just $70m.The retailer bought the bank for an undisclosed sum from CMS Energy. It said it would now promote the loan service to contractors who use its network of more than 900 stores across the US.Jim Stoddart, president of Home Depot Supply, declined to speculate on possible opposition to the bank aquisition, noting that EnerBank had a “regulatory sound” business model.“EnerBank deals with hundreds of contractors, and we do business with hundreds of thousands of contractors. So this is a tremendous opportunity for us,” he said.He also argued that the acquisition was part of Home Depot’s drive to expand its services for contractors. In March, it closed its $3.51bn deal for Hughes Supply, which distributes construction, repair and maintenance products.The retailer also insisted that it intended to continue to focus on the bank’s existing business, and had no plans to change other aspects of its credit offerings.In common with other US retailers, Home Depot already offers branded credit cards and loans to individual customers - with 16m proprietary cards issued by Citibank accounting for around a quarter of its store sales last year.The change of ownership requires the approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which earlier this year organised unprecedented public hearings to review Wal-Mart’s application for a Utah industrial bank charter.The Wal-Mart bank bid renewed a debate in Washington over the role of industrial banks, which the Federal Reserve and some members of Congress argue undermine federal laws aimed at separating banking and commerce.Wal-Mart has insisted it would restrict the operations of its proposed bank to back-office processing of its electronic payments.FDIC could also choose to open Home Depot’s takeover of EnerBank to public comment.A number of car companies, including Volkswagen and BMW, use their Utah-based banks to issue car and home loans, while Target, the discount retailer, uses its Utah bank to issue business credit cards.Existing banking regulations allow state-chartered industrial banks to issue credit cards, take deposits, and open retail branches.
472;HD;Home Depot;2006-05-04T17:10:04Z;FTSE fights back as rumour mill cranks up;;There was a speculative feel to trading in London on Thursday as the rumour mill, which has been uncharacteristically quiet for the past couple of weeks, cranked back into action.Kingfisher, owner of the B&Q DIY chain, proved to be the main talking point. Its shares gained 2.9 per cent to 230¾p amid speculation of a private equity bid approach or plans to sell its French business, Castorama.Analysts were sceptical of both tales. On the idea of venture capital interest they said Kingfisher did not generate enough cash to support any further gearing. As for the sale of Castorama, they pointed out that it would leave Kingfisher exposed to the fiercely competitive UK DIY market.However, they conceded a bid from Kingfisher from an American rival such as Home Depot, Lowe’s could not be ruled out even though both companies have shown little interest in the European home improvement market.Stockbroker Williams De Broe also pointed out that Nobia, the largest European manufacturer of kitchens, and Dobbies Gardens Centres have both recently reported signs of life in the UK DIY market.The session’s other speculative feature was InterContinental Hotels Group, which gained 5.9 per cent to £10.00½p amid talk of predatory interest from Permira, the private equity house.UBS said the rumours could not be discounted but cautioned that a leveraged buyout of InterContinental, owner of the Holiday Inn chain, would only work if it the company could be relisted in the US where hotel companies command a higher stock market ratings.Elsewhere, Next improved 0.8 per cent to £16.83 amid talk that management has been in the City meeting investors and analysts and hinting that guidance for a 3-6 per cent fall in like for sales this year might be a touch conservative and that a 1-3 per cent decline might be more appropriate.In the wider market, leading shares recouped some of Wedesday’s 72-point loss helped by strong performances from speciality chemicals group ICI, which rose 6.7 per cent to 394¾p after first quarter results impressed, and property stocks British Land and Land Securities which gained 2 per cent to £12.86 and 2.6 per cent to £18.94 respectively after Hammerson, up 1.7 per cent to £12.02, announced plans to adopt a tax-efficient REIT structure. The final scores showed the FTSE 100 up 26.9 points, or 0.45 per cent at 6,036.9. The FTSE 250 index firmed 60.3 points, or 0.61 per cent, to 9,956.6.Cruise ship operator Carnival gained 2.8 per cent to £24.70 after Morgan Stanley drew investors’ attention to upbeat comments made by rival Royal Caribbean to analysts aboard its new ship, the Freedom of the Seas, on Wednesday.“RC’s confident tone suggest the booking environment remains robust, even in the Caribbean market that has been a bit soft.” it said.Elsewhere, Alliance & Leicester improved 1 per cent to £11.22 on as takeover rumours resurfaced. Traders reckon the mortgage lender could be a target for Spain’s Santander, which will have plenty of cash should it sell the closed life operations of its Abbey subsidiary to Resolution. They also note that Santander is planing to issue a sterling denominated bond.Meanwhile, shares in Resolution rose 6.2 per cent to 703½p after Morgan Stanley upgraded to “overweight” from “equal-weight” and set a 823p target price. “If Resolution is successful in acquiring the close life funds of Abbey, the transaction would be transformational for the group,” the bank said.Spirent, the telecoms equipment testing company which issued an upbeat trading statement on Wednesday, improved 1.6 per cent to 46p on rumours of predatory interest from the US. In a recent research report, UBS noted that Spirent trades at a 50 per cent discount to its peer group and has net cash of £150m.Takeover rumours were also swirling round Invensys, the controls and automation group. The word in the Square Mile late yesterday was that Germany’s Siemens is poised to strike. Invensys shares improved 2.2 per cent to 23.5p.JJB Sports eased 0.4 per cent to 178¾p as traders picked up on a regulatory announcement that appeared to show West Coast Capital, the investment vehicle of Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, had sold 16.5m shares, or 7.2 per cent of the company. However, people close to Sir Tom said the shares were related to a “forward” sale transaction with a Swiss bank, struck in 2001.
473;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Best Buy to make Shanghai debut;;Best Buy, the largest US consumer products retailer, has chosen Shanghai as the site of its first store in China.The retailer said over the weekend that it expected the Best Buy branded store to occupy four floors of the Jiang Shan Building in the Xu Jia Hui commercial area of Shanghai, the city’s leading shopping district.Best Buy will be the first US electronics retailer to move into China, where it estimates the market for consumer electronics will be worth $85bn this year, growing to over $100bn by 2010.Best Buy’s move follows Wal-Mart, which is currently the only US mass retailer with a presence in China. Home Depot, the home improvement chain, is also reported to be planning an imminent move into China, while Gap, the clothing retailer, has also said it wanted to establish stores there.Best Buy has said the initial store would be used to test and learn about the market, but that it expects to establish a strategic but “manageable” presence.The company has declined to comment on reports that it has been in talks with Five Star Appliance, the Chinese electronics chain, over a possible investment. Al Lenzmeier, Best Buy’s vice-chairman, said the retailer believed its initial move into China “will become an important part of our strategy to develop controlled growth opportunities internationally.”The new store will be around 86,000 square feet in size, larger than the average Best Buy store in the US and Canada.

The bond, lead-managed by BNP Paribas and Lehman Brothers, was offered to yield 7 basis points above mid-swap rates and 23.5bp over the comparable 15-year French government bond.In the US, acquisition financing produced two bumper bonds. MidAmerican, the energy subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, sold $1.7bn in 30-year paper at 130bp over Treasury yields.The deal, led by Lehman Brothers, JPMorgan and RBS Greenwich, was cut from an original $3.25bn. Early guidance had suggested a spread of 125bp but the final pricing was higher.A $4bn two tranche deal from Home Depot was due to price late. JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley were leading the sale of $1bn in five-year and $3bn in
10-year paper.Rentokil Initial, the UK pest control company, sold £300m of 10-year bonds to yield 133bp above mid-swap rates. Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas and RBS were the lead managers."
475;HD;Home Depot;2006-03-16T00:00:09Z;Google considers European retail push;;Google is attempting a significant push into the European retail industry with plans to launch a service aimed at giving traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers a base from which to market and sell their goods online.The US-based search engine company plans to develop Google Base, a product still in testing, into an online retail platform. The service would give retailers access to the hundreds of millions of Google users.Nikesh Arora, head of Google’s European arm, said in an interview with the FT that Google wanted companies in retail – and possibly sectors such as real estate – to hand over details of their goods, prices and customers.Google would index and package the information into a consumer-friendly search engine, giving its users a virtual supermarket across a number of retail brands.Mr Arora said: “Google Base is going to have a huge impact on retailers,” adding that the move reflected internal research, which found many leading European retailers did not feel they were competitive enough online.But it is unclear how companies will respond, given that many of the world’s biggest retailers – including Wal-Mart, the world’s leading retailer, Home Depot, the US home improvement company and Tesco, the UK supermarkets group – have invested millions in online operations.Some retailers are yet to set up their own internet operations, even though consumer purchases online have soared.One big UK retailer with no online presence said on Wednesday that Google’s retail offer would be of interest if the internet company could also arrange for distribution. This potentially huge task has raised doubts about the long-term business models of other online retailers such as Amazon.com.Though ambitious, Google’s plan to create a broader e-commerce platform for retailers lags similar initiatives from Amazon and Ebay. UK clothing and foods group Marks and Spencer, US discounter Target and US bookseller Borders have contracted out online operations to Amazon.Until now, Google had been vague about its ambitions for Google Base, which is structured as a collection of databases. Besides being used as a platform for retailers, industry observers who had seen the “beta” version of the product thought the service would be aimed at consumers and allow individuals to swap classified ads for free.Google is under pressure to develop new business lines amid fears that growth in its online advertising revenue is slowing after a strong recent run.Google’s research – based on interviews with 20 of Europe’s top retailers – reveals a high level of dissatisfaction among retail executives about their online operations.
476;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Best Buy in talks for stake in Chinese rival;;Best Buy, the biggest electronics chain in the US, is in talks to buy a stake in its Chinese rival, Five Star Appliance, in a deal that would mark the first big move by a foreign retailer in the country’s $63bn-a-year market for household appliances.People close to the situation said Best Buy, which has pledged to open its first store in China this year, was in exclusive talks with Five Star, the fourth-biggest chain in the country’s fast-growing market for consumer electronics.It is understood Best Buy, which is believed to be advised by Credit Suisse, is looking to buy a minority holding in Five Star and forge a strategic alliance to bolster its plans for organic growth in the country.People close to the situation said the talks with Five Star, which is controlled by its management, were advanced. But they warned that no decision on the size and type of deal had been made.A move by Best Buy would underline foreign retailers’ growing interest in China’s consumer markets after years during which the country was seen mainly as a low-cost source of products. In the past few months, international groups such as Wal-Mart, Carrefour and Home Depot have looked either to expand or set up in China.The market for consumer electronics products in China has grown by an average of more than 15 per cent a year since 2000 but it remains dominated by local companies.A deal with Five Star, which has 150 stores, would help Best Buy to gain valuable intelligence on a market that is changing fast due to the rapid emergence of a wealthier Chinese middle class. It would also enable it to tap into a nationwide chain and challenge Gome, the market leader.Best Buy, Credit Suisse and Five Star declined to comment on the talks.
477;HD;Home Depot;2006-03-03T22:16:57Z;‘I wanted something universal’;;"Bernie Marcus is a philanthropist with a pugnacious streak. “How stupid can you be to give money to Harvard University?” he asks in a typically candid moment. “Its endowment [$26bn] is bigger than a lot of countries’ [budgets] and there’s no accountability. It doesn’t do anything to educate students – they’re still charging $40,000 or $50,000 for tuition.”But if Harvard is not going to benefit from his largesse, many others have. Marcus, who co-founded The Home Depot, is now a distinguished 76-year-old, with a tuft of white hair, a wide smile and sharp, clear eyes. He doesn’t like to talk about how much he has given but published estimates suggest he has given away almost $600m.His brand of philanthropy belongs to the do-it-yourself ethos of the customers who walk into Home Depot’s cavernous stores and walk out with the materials to make their homes better. He expects to get his hands dirty, and to have some control over the outcome of his giving. Hence his problem with Harvard.“When I give money to a university, there are strings attached. They have to be accountable,” says Marcus, who retired as chairman of Home Depot in 2002. “Most people have made money through hard work and sacrifice, and then they write a cheque to get their name on a building? They suddenly become stupid. If I came to you and asked you for $25m you’d ask for a business plan and outcomes, but universities do it all the time.”The core concerns of Marcus’s philanthropy all spring from his life’s experience – children’s causes, medical research, and Israel. He gave $200m to build the new Georgia Aquarium, which opened last year, as a way to thank Atlanta, where the home improvement chain was started in 1979.He was prompted to start The Marcus Institute, a leading research institute on childhood brain disorders, in 1990 to help a Home Depot employee whose child had emotional and psychological disabilities. Since then Marcus estimates he has given $70m to the institute, which has taken care of about 24,000 children, many with autism. On a personal note, it fed his interest in medicine, which goes back to his childhood when he wanted to be a doctor.And he created the Israel Democracy Institute, a think-tank based in Jerusalem, to have an impact on themes that had mattered deeply to him since his Orthodox Jewish childhood. “I was very affected by the Holocaust as a child,” he says. “Why would someone want to kill me just because I’m Jewish? Why would someone want to kill the person who cured polio because he’s a Jew?”In spite of this passionate undercurrent, he still took a critical businessman’s attitude to Israel. The IDI, which he established in 1991, works with the Knesset to strengthen Israel’s democracy. “A country with a weak democracy can’t stand,” he says. “They’ve been able to defend themselves but their form of democracy is their Achilles’ heel.”“Israel has been a socialist country for 45 years; it’s just now realising the benefits of the free enterprise system,” he says. “It is working. We’re pushing free enterprise through IDI.”Marcus attributes his desire to help others get ahead to his mother, a Russian immigrant. Even though their family lived in a poor section of a poor city – Newark, New Jersey – she taught her children to set aside money for charity. “She was a rather amazing woman,” he says. “I never thought about [charity] as part of my personality or character. As I grew up and struggled through college and retailing, I’d always give back.”When he could not afford to give money, he gave his time. When he sat on the board of the City of Hope, an organisation focused on cancer research, Marcus cajoled others to fund a leukaemia treatment – bone marrow transplants, the now standard treatment. During the Six day war in 1967, he sold war bonds: “We raised a lot of money and saved Israel.”Likewise, when he and Arthur Blank, his co-founder, started The Home Depot they gave away materials and employees’ time in lieu of cash donations. “We taught our people it was very important to give back to the community,” he says. “If there was a tornado, we’d send people out of the store with chain saws to help cut trees down. We felt it was something we had to do.”He is proudest of associates who acted on their own without seeking permission. This ranged from shipping in more plywood ahead of a hurricane to sending timber to shore up the walls of the Pentagon shortly after the September 11 attack. “I never knew about it,” he says. “They just did it.”Being deeply involved in what he funds is the key to his philanthropy. “It’s so easy to write out a cheque, get your picture in the paper and feel good about yourself,” he says. “I think that if good business people get involved then charities would be run better.”The Georgia Aquarium is a good example. It is the largest aquarium in the US but it was conceived of quite narrowly, as a way to increase the number of visitors to Atlanta and give the city an economic boost. It could have easily been something else as long as it was significant for the city, in the way the San Diego Zoo was unique to that city.“I always wanted to do something that had universal appeal,” he says. “The most hard-nosed, miserable person will have a smile on his face when he leaves the aquarium.”Consistent with the business philosophy that underpins the rest of his philanthropy, Marcus expects the aquarium to become profitable. This will come from ticket sales as well as renting out the ballroom, which looks into the aquarium. “We did everything on the basis of it being self-supporting, so people don’t need to keep throwing money at it,” he says. “The only thing that is going to need support is education.”Even though one of his institutes bears his name, he keeps a low profile by comparison with other philanthropists. Except for the price of the aquarium, which he figured would get out regardless of what he did, Marcus does not like to discuss the amounts he gives.He does not publish an annual bulletin, and The Marcus Foundation, the umbrella organisation for his philanthropy, does not have a website. The names of his board members are not publicised, for fear, he says, that they would be inundated with proposals.“It’s not a numbers game,” he says. “I’m not doing it for the headlines. I’m not doing it for my ego.”And unlike many big philanthropists, he is not making a bid for immortality. He has made his foundation self-liquidating, a remarkable step for someone like Marcus whose net worth was estimated to be $2.2bn by Business Week magazine. According to the bylaws, everything has to be given away within 30 years of his death. “I have rules of what they should give to and what they should not give to,” he says. But he fears these could be changed without him around. “In 40 years, they’re going to give to things I don’t believe in. They’re going to be a hand-out group.”But he has no plans to stop fighting for what he wants. He is still looking for projects to fund and ways to increase the impact in areas he currently funds. “I have no stop line,” he says. “I’m going to keep going until they carry me out of here.”"

Shares in rival Home Depotrode on the coat-tails of Lowe’s upbeat guidance for the coming year, gaining 2 per cent to $42.46.Shares in chipmakers lifted after sector bellwether Intel was upgraded by JMP Securities from “market perform” to “outperform”. The broker cited confidence in various upcoming product launches, including chips for Apple’s new notebooks.“We expect Apple to broaden its use of Intel processors with the likely introduction of new low-end and mid-range notebooks and a likely Mac Mini home entertainment platform based on Intel architecture,” analyst Krishna Shankar said in a research note.Intel shares rose 0.8 per cent to $20.52, while the wider Amex semiconductor index gained 0.5 per cent.After days of reported negotiations, National Grid, of the UK, has agreed to acquire natural gas seller KeySpan for $7.3bn, or $42 a share. But KeySpan shares fell 1.6 per cent to $40.76 as investors cashed in on the widely anticipated deal.By contrast, shares in Stewart & Stevenson Services surged 26.7 per cent to $34.33 after the military truck maker agreed to be bought by Armor Holdings for $775m, or $35 a share.Walt Disney gained 1.4 per cent to $28.38 after rumours that Apple Computer might make a bid for the entertainment conglomerate once Steve Jobs becomes Disney’s leading shareholder. Apple shares fell 0.7 per cent to $70.99.Deal talk also swirled around electricity provider Texas Utilities, which jumped 5.9 per cent to $52.70 on reports that General Electric was looking to take a stake in the company. GE, which had separately announced plans to sell its remaining stake in its life and mortgage insurance unit, for about $2.8bn, rose 0.5 per cent to $33.32.Other movers, included Merrill Lynch, which gained 1.5 per cent to $77.88 after the bank’s board approved the buyback of up to $6bn of its common stock, and computer maker Hewlett-Packard, which rallied from last week’s profit-taking, jumping 4.3 per cent to $33.41.
479;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Lowe’s profits jump 37% as sales hit $10.8bn;;Lowe’s, the world’s second largest do-it-yourself retailer, on Monday said solid economic growth, rising employment and record home ownership in the US would lead to another strong year for the company, following a 37 per cent increase in fourth quarter net profits.Rising interest rates and slowing housing turnover have caused some analysts to predict a softening in the US home improvement market this year.But Robert Niblock, chief executive of Lowe’s, forecast that average US real personal income would grow at more than double last year’s rate, supporting continued spending on DIY.“The vast majority of our customers are homeowners, and they are not willing to let what is often their most valuable assets deteriorate.” he said. “We're optimistic about 2006 and beyond.”Net earnings were $695m, or 87 cents a share, easily beating Wall Street’s consensus expectation of 80 cents a share.The results, described by Goldman Sachs as “stellar”, underlined Lowe’s status as one of the fastest-growing large US retailers.Lowe’s is expanding faster than its bigger rival Home Depot – which increased fourth-quarter profits by 23 per cent – because it has more room left to grow in the US.At the end of the quarter, Lowe’s had just over 1,200 stores compared to Home Depot’s 2,000.The North Carolina-based company is also out-performing its rival on a store-by-store basis, with comparable store sales – those made in outlets open for more than a year – up 7.8 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared to Home Depot’s 5.5 per cent.Total sales for the quarter ended February 3 increased 26 per cent to $10.8bn.Analysts said the entire home improvement sector had benefited from an unusually mild January, which brought more people out shopping, and surging sales in southern states affected by last year’s severe hurricanes.For 2006, Lowe’s forecast full-year earnings growth of 17-20 per cent and sales growth of 13-14 per cent.Lowe’s is planning to make its first foray outside the US this year by opening up to 10 stores in Canada. Home Depot already has operations in Canada and Mexico and is planning to enter China.Home Depot is also seeking fresh growth by diversifying into the professional supply sector, providing construction and maintenance materials to industrial customers. Lowe’s, in contrast, has remained focused on home improvement.
480;HD;Home Depot;2006-02-24T21:55:52Z;Oil and poor data rein in Wall Street’s gains;;Wall Street ended a volatile week with a mixed performance on Friday as rising crude prices and continuing concerns about US interest rates reined in gains seen earlier in the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.1 per cent at 11,061.85 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to 2,287.04. The S&P 500, helped by sharp gains in energy stocks, rose 0.1 per cent to 1,289.43.The session capped a choppy week of trading, which saw the Dow lose 0.5 per cent and both the S&P and the Nasdaq edge up 0.2 per cent.Differing inflation readings and volatile crude prices were responsible for the market’s swings.Shares fell on Tuesday after the Conference Board’s leading indicators rose for the fourth successive month, suggesting robust economic growth. However, stocks moved higher the next trading day after benign core inflation data gave hope that the Federal Reserve was almost done with its cycle of monetary tightening.But stocks fell again on Thursday after a drop in jobless claims raised fears of wage-pushed inflation. And on Friday shares put in a mixed performance amid data showing that a decline in aircraft orders at Boeing helped push new orders for US made durable goods down 10.2 per cent in January, the biggest drop in five-and-a-half years.In spite of diverging economic data, James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said most of the figures that came in this week pointed to a strong economy.The week’s trade, he said, was marked by the conflict over whether strong growth is good or bad for stocks. “Most felt that the Fed should be done tightening but the reality is that the economy is too strong for the Fed to quit,” he added.The two biggest US retailers reported fourth-quarter results early in the week, but it was Friday’s earnings miss by Gap which sealed the fate of the sector. The clothing company reported its first annual fall in profit in four years, forcing it to lower its guidance for the current year as it lost customers to rivals like Abercrombie & Fitch. Gap fell 2.1 per cent to $18.43, while Abercrombie, which reported last week, eased 0.5 per cent to $64.92.Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, reported on Tuesday, and although it beat forecasts, the company’s statement on its outlook failed to match expectations. Its shares were down 1.4 per cent on the week to $45.45.Fellow Dow constituent Home Depot was down 0.5 per cent to $41.63, in spite of revealing a better-than-expected 30 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings. Meanwhile, Federated Department Stores failed to impress with its fourth-quarter net-profit increase and fell 1.6 per cent to $70.45.Volatile oil prices caused some uncertainty with energy stocks early in the week but Friday’s explosion at a Saudi Arabian facility and further concerns over Nigerian exports helped crude prices and oil companies higher.Sunoco was on Friday upgraded to “outperform” from “peer perform” by Bear Stearns as the broker expected strengthening refining margins. Its shares were up 2.3 per cent on Friday, but only 1.1 per cent on the week to $77.96.The top weekly gainers in the sector were ConocoPhillips, up 1.3 per cent to $62.73, and Valero Energy gained 3.1 per cent to $56.19.Among other movers, H&R Block, the biggest US tax advisory service, lost 9.1 per cent on the week to $23.01 after saying on Friday it had underestimated its own income tax rate, leaving it owing a further $32m and forcing it to restate its accounts for the second time in six months.Shares of Dana fell to their lowest level in three decades amid mounting concerns about the financial health of the autoparts supplier. Its shares ended the week 64.3 per cent lower at $1.51 after ratings downgrades by Moody’s and S&P sent the group deeper into junk status.It was closely followed by Sherwin-Williams, which slumped 21.6 per cent this week to $41.29 after analysts said the paint maker could face millions of dollars in clean-up costs for homes tainted with lead paint following a jury ruling.News that British utility National Grid was in talks to acquire Keyspan for $7.3bn drove up the shares of the biggest natural gas seller in the US 2.5 per cent this week to $41.41.Following the earnings driven gains of last week for Hewlett-Packard, profit taking hit the stock, dragging its shares 6 per cent lower this week to $32.02.
481;HD;Home Depot;2006-02-24T20:42:30Z;Spitzer faces challenger in governorship race;;With his approval rating near 70 per cent and the opposing party in some disarray, Eliot Spitzer would appear to be cruising towards the New York governor’s office.But the attorney-general, having for months appeared such a formidible candidate that no Democrat would bother to challenge him for the party’s nomination, now faces a rival eager to crash the coronation. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island politician with little statewide name recognition and even less cash in his coffers, is to announce his long-shot candidacy today.There are two reasons why Mr Spitzer is taking the challenge seriously. First is Mr Suozzi’s reputation as a tough campaigner. And the other is Mr Suozzi’s most vocal cheerleader - Ken Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, who has vowed to do anything he can to block Mr Spitzer’s ascent.Mr Langone has been caught up in efforts by Mr Spitzer, as attorney general, to investigate the compensation awarded to Dick Grasso, the former head of the New York Stock Exchange. In a twist of timing, Mr Langone could be called to testify about his role on the NYSE’s compensation committee at Mr Grasso’s trial, scheduled to open just days before the November election.So far, Mr Langone has contributed at least $32,000 to Mr Suozzi’s campaign, and he has helped raise money from friends such as Bernard Marcus, another Home Depot founder. Still, Mr Suozzi had amassed only $5m by the end of January, compared with Mr Spitzer’s $19m.Mr Langone rejects accusations that he is seeking revenge by supporting Mr Suozzi. “As someone who has been irresponsibly targeted by Spitzer, he has come to see the broad harm Spitzer has done to business and jobs in the state,” says James McCarthy, a spokesman for Mr Langone. Mr Spitzer’s campaign points out that Wall Street firms have reported strong results since the settlement of his office’s claims against them.Mr Spitzer’s highly-publicised crusades against powerful business interests have made him an internationally-known figure. And many powerful New York Democrats - who have been locked out of the governor’s office for over a decade - believe he can ride his corruption-busting image to victorySome political strategists say Mr Spitzer may be able to undermine Mr Suozzi by depicting as a pawn of Mr Langone. But if Mr Langone can mine anti-Spitzer sentiment among his wealthy peers to raise the $10m-$15m needed to keep Mr Suozzi competitive until the Democratic primary on September 12, he may prove to be an asset to his candidate, says Hank Sheinkopf, a political strategist who advised Mr Spitzer in his first campaign for attorney general.“The question is if Suozzi can raise enough money to get traction,” Mr Sheinkopf says. “I don’t think Langone is a factor except for his ability to raise money.”Mr Sheinkopf adds that Mr Suozzi is a tough campaigner who broke decades of Republican power to become executive of Nassau County, a large Long Island suburb. “Everything he has done has been counter to conventional wisdom,” he says. “Eliot Spitzer takes this very seriously - he is a chess player strategist and he’s a very competitive man.”
482;HD;Home Depot;2006-02-21T22:36:40Z;Wall Street falls on US interest-rate concerns;;Wall Street fell on Tuesday as strong results from the retail sector, rising oil prices and better-than-forecast economic data fuelled inflationary fears and expectations of more aggressive interest rate increases.By the close in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4 per cent at 11,069.06, while the S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent lower at 1,283.03 and the Nasdaq Composite was off 0.9 per cent at 2,262.49.Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, fell 1.1 per cent to $45.74 in spite of a forecast-beating 13.4 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings as its outlook statement fell shy of expectations.Fellow Dow constituent Home Depot was little changed at $41.87 after it also unveiled better-than-expected results that included a 30 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings, boosted by revenue growth across all divisions.Meanwhile, RadioShack, the troubled electronics retailer, reversed early gains and fell 0.4 per cent to $19 after a 62 per cent fall in fourth-quarter earnings. Some strategists felt there was value in the stock, however, following the resignation of David Edmondson, chief executive.“We believe there is so much bad news priced in at this point, that disappointing near-term results will be discounted in anticipation of improvements from new management,” said David Strasser, at Bank of America, upgrading the stock from “sell” to “neutral”.Federated Department Stores, owner of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, said its acquisition of May Department Stores in August had helped drive a 59 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net profit, while a tax settlement also helped boost earnings. The results, however, fell a little short of expectations and the shares fell 1.7 per cent to $70.40.Following the earnings-driven gains of last week for Hewlett-Packard, profit taking hit the stock and the computer hardware sector. HP shares were down 4.6 per cent to $32.51, while sector peers Dell and Apple fell 1.9 per cent to $29.81 and 1.7 per cent to $69.08 respectively.This weakness permeated the wider technology sector. Texas Instruments, the chipmaker, fell 2.6 per cent to $30.65, while rival Broadcom slid 2.8 per cent to $65.99 and Applied Materials lost 2.2 per cent to $19.29.Carnival, the cruise operator, was down 3.2 per cent to $51.83 after Credit Suisse cut its rating to “neutral” from “outperform” as it expected weaker-than-forecast peak season bookings and higher promotional costs.Oil stocks were among the biggest gainers after a rise in crude prices. Among them, ConocoPhillips added 2.9 per cent to $62.83 while Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group, climbed 6.3 per cent to $72.85.On the data front, the Conference Board’s leading indicators, an index of 10 components including jobless claims and factory orders, rose for the fourth-successive month, suggesting robust economic growth.
483;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Baby Boomers a bundle of joy for Home Depot;;Home Depot on Tuesday said surging demand for installation services from Baby Boomers led to a 23 per cent increase in net profits in the fourth quarter.Services such as roofing, flooring and kitchen-fitting have become an increasingly important business for home improvement retailers as they seek to extend their appeal beyond do-it-yourself enthusiasts.Bob Nardelli, chief executive, said growth in services was being driven by America’s affluent post-war generation as they increase spending on their homes and, in many cases, buy additional properties.“Baby Boomers are the largest segment of the population and we are seeing a definite move among this group towards do-it-for-me services,” he said.Revenues from services grew by more than a fifth last year and now account for 5 per cent of the company’s total.The results showed that home improvement remains among the best-performing parts of the US retail sector, confounding predictions that increased interest rates and slowing housing turnover could cool sales.Average spending per customer was up nearly 6 per cent at $57.20 as the company sold more high-value items such as home appliances, power tools, garden furniture and Ralph Lauren-branded paint.Home Depot is increasing returns from its 2,000 existing stores by widening its range of products and focusing on big-ticket transactions as the company’s rate of expansion declines.Comparable store sales – those made in outlets open for more than a year – were up 5.5 per cent in the quarter, while total revenues rose 16 per cent to $19.5bn.Net profits were $1.3bn, or 60 cents a share, beating Wall Street’s consensus forecast of 56 cents a share.Mr Nardelli voiced confidence about 2006 and reiterated the company’s target of 10-14 per cent full-year earnings growth.Home Depot spent $2.5bn acquiring 21 companies last year, including National Waterworks, a supplier of water and sewerage infrastructure, as part of its search for fresh sources of growth.Last month, it announced plans to double the size of its professional business through the $3.2bn acquisition of Hughes Supply, a distributor of construction and maintenance materials. 
484;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Kingfisher’s UK sales continue to deteriorate;;Conditions at Kingfisher’s core UK chain B&Q continued to deteriorate in the last quarter of the year as Europe’s largest home improvement retailer blamed a depressed market.Kingfisher said in its fourth quarter trading update that despite outperforming the DIY market in the UK, underlying sales at B&Q, which account for almost half of group sales, still fell by 9 per cent to £850m, compared with a 7.8 per cent drop for the full year to £3.9bn.To drive sales and improve market share, Kingfisher was forced to reduce prices, extend promotions, and clear stock with markdowns, which resulted in a lower gross margin. For the full-year, B&Q’s gross margin fell by just over 200 basis points, the company said. B&Q’s profits had more than halved in the third quarter.Gerry Murphy, chief executive, said: “The UK home improvement market remains depressed and price competitive. B&Q’s new management team has acted decisively to support short-term trading, manage stocks and reduce costs at the same time as accelerating the development of B&Q’s stores, ranges and services for the future.”On Thursday, the Office for National Statistics reported that high street sales in January fell at their fastest pace in over a year, with the volume of retail sales declining by 1.3 per cent between December and January, compared with analysts’ forecasts of a 0.2 per cent fall. Household goods stores were the worst performer, suffering a decline of 3 per cent.The only bright spot in the UK for Kingfisher was the trade market, as underlying sales at Kingfisher’s trade businesses, Screwfix Direct and Trade Depot, rose by 37 per cent to £72m in the fourth quarter, and by 19 per cent to £272m for the year.Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer that has long been rumoured to have an interest in buying Kingfisher to expand in Europe, last month agreed to buy Hughes Supply for £3.5bn in its largest acquisition so far to enlarge its professional division as the US home improvement market moves closer to saturation.Kingfisher continued to fare much better in France than in the UK, where its Castorama and Brico Depot stores outperformed a flat DIY market in the quarter as underlying sales rose 2.5 per cent to £608m.It also performed strongly in China, where underlying sales rose by 8 per cent to £117m. However, Kingfisher could soon be faced with competition from Home Depot, which is in talks to buy a 49 per cent stake in Orient Home, one of China’s largest DIY chains as home improvement retailing grows at five or six times the rate of the US market.Across the group, underlying sales fell by 0.5 per cent in the quarter, and total sales rose by 5.6 per cent, to £1.86bn. For the full-year, underlying sales fell by 2.2 per cent to £8.0bn.Shares fell by 2¾ p to 225 in early morning trade in London.
485;HD;Home Depot;2006-02-14T21:35:17Z;Dow leaps above 11,000 after strong retail sales;;Unexpectedly strong retail sales data, combined with gains for technology stocks, helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its best performance of the year and drove it back above the 11,000 level.The Department of Commerce said January retail sales rose 2.3 per cent, easily beating the 0.9 per cent forecast by analysts.The Dow closed 1.3 per cent higher to 11,028.39, the S&P 500 added 1 per cent to 1,275.53 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,262.17.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, was up 1.1 per cent to $21.37 after Apple Computer said it was to start rolling out its MacBook Pro laptop range Intel processors.Intel’s gains came in spite of a lowered price target from UBS. The broker said it believed competitive pressure from Advanced Micro Devices would cause erosion to margins as the company lowered prices to defend its 80 per cent market share. AMD shares climbed 3.2 per cent to $40.22.Apple benefited from news that Warner Music Group’s quarterly profit had more than doubled thanks to rising sales of digital music through outlets such as Apple’s iTunes online music store.Although Warner shares were down 1.8 per cent to $20.43 on falling revenues, shares in Apple gained 4.5 per cent to $67.65.Meanwhile, RealNetworks leapt 15.3 per cent to $8.53 after it was upgraded by Piper Jaffray from “market perform” to “outperform” ahead of its results due out after the Wall Street close. The broker cited strength in the company’s core digital music business.3M, the industrial group and maker of such products as Scotch tape, added 1.1 per cent to $73.70 after the Dow constituent raised its quarterly dividend and announced a share buyback.Among other strong performers on the Dow, aluminium producer Alcoa gained 3.7 per cent to $31.37, while Home Depot gained 3.6 per cent to $41.13, and Hewlett-Packard climbed 2.4 per cent to $32.50.Cendant, owner of the Avis car rental company, fell sharply after it announced that 2006 earnings would rise by “low single digits”, less than the 10-12 per cent guidance the company gave in December. The shares fell 6.7 per cent to $15.70.Marsh & McLennan, the world’s largest insurance broker, reported net income of $35m, beating its $680m loss in the previous year, but this fell short of expectations.The company said lower insurance premium rates, as well as currency effects and weaker equity investment sales, were responsible for the shortfall, and the shares fell 4.8 per cent to $29.09.Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, said it had revised its fourth-quarter results higher by more than a third following a lower than expected charge on an asset sale.

486;HD;Home Depot;2006-02-13T09:51:24Z;Home Depot in talks for stake in China;;Home Depot, the world’s biggest do-it-yourself group, is in talks to acquire a large stake in Orient Home, one of China’s largest DIY chains. An agreement would mark the US group’s entry into the $50bn Chinese home improvement market.People close to the situation said the US group was in talks to acquire up to 49 per cent in Orient Home from its parent, the Chinese conglomerate Orient Group, for more than $200m.The acquisition of the holding in the Chinese group, which plans to increase its chain of warehouse-like stores from 27 to more than 100 by 2010, would represent Home Depot’s first foray into Asia.It would also enable the US group to compete with international rivals such B&Q, owned by Kingfisher, the UK group, in China’s fast-growing DIY market. An official at Orient Group said: “The two parties are still discussing all kinds of possibilities for the deal.” The Atlanta-based Home Depot declined to comment. In 2004 it said it aimed to enter the Chinese market but has since given few details.Expansion in China would help provide a fresh source of growth for Home Depot as the US home improvement market draws nearer to saturation. The company’s only existing stores outside the US are in Canada and Mexico.People familiar with the situation said Orient Home had held talks with a number of international retailers but Home Depot was the favourite. However, they cautioned that no deal had yet been signed and the talks could still collapse.The DIY market in China, whose value has been estimated at $50bn a year, has attracted considerable interest from foreign and domestic retailers because it is expected to benefit from growing urbanisation, an expanding middle class and a rapid increase in private home ownership. Last year, B&Q, which has 22 stores in China with sales of more than £200m ($350m), bought the 13 Chinese outlets of its German rival OBI.However, home improvement retailers have faced a number of obstacles. Cheap local labour has meant customers are less likely to buy their own tools and analysts say consumers use stores to get ideas for furniture, which they then copy. Government measures to slow the property market – which have led to falls in house prices in Shanghai – have also affected the market for hardware goods. B&Q has cited the property measures as one reason for its decision to open new stores in China that specialise in soft furnishings.Orient Group’s interests inc-lude finance, construction materials and logistics, and stakes in Minseng Banking Corporation and Haitong Securities. The group’s sales in the first nine months of last year – most of which came from the Orient Home business – were Rmb2.2bn ($270m), with net profits of Rmb71.9m.

Aluminium maker Alcoa lost 3.6 per cent to $30.87, while shares in gold miner Newmont Mining gave up 6.8 per cent to $56.39.The losses weighed on the S&P 500, which closed down 0.8 per cent at 1,254.78. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent to 10,749.76 while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,244.96.The indices’ woes were compounded by weaknesses in the housing sector, which came following a bearish forecast from luxury builder Toll Brothers.In the latest sign that the US housing market was cooling, Toll Brothers said its first-quarter sales had plunged 29 per cent and cut its sales guidance for the full year. Its shares tumbled more than 5.5 per cent to $29.47 while rivals DR Horton and Pulte Homes fell 3.7 per cent to $33.67 and2.3 per cent to $37.07 respectively.Toll’s warning cast a shadow on home improvement retailers with Home Depot dropping 1.6 per cent to $38.86 and Lowes falling 1.7 per cent to $61.87.Meanwhile, technology stocks continued to be a focus ahead of fourth-quarter results from internet equipment maker Cisco Systems, due after the close. Cisco shares were up 1.5 per cent at $18.09 in spite of talk that the bellwether would deliver lower sales guidance for fiscal 2006.By contrast, Google failed to impress investors with a new version of its Gmail e-mail service. Shares in the search engine continued to suffer from renewed selling, losing 4.5 per cent to $367.92.Losses on the Dow were limited by Walt Disney, which surged 7 per cent to $26.70 after the media conglomerate delivered an unexpected gain in first-quarter profit. The stock was further buoyed by news that Citadel Broadcasting had agreed to acquire its radio assets in a deal valued at $2.7bn.Better than expected quarterly earnings lifted shares of soft drink giant Coca-Cola, up 0.2 per cent at $41.03, and power supplies maker Emerson Electric, up 2.7 per cent at $78.96.General Motors agreed to cut its quarterly dividend in half and reduce executive pay after reporting $8.5bn in losses last year.Its shares fell 2.3 per cent to $22.81 as investors questioned whether the move would help halt its slide.
488;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Home Depot to buy Hughes Supply for $3.5bn;;"Home Depot on Tuesday agreed to buy Hughes Supply, a distributor of construction and building maintenance products, for $3.47bn, accelerating the company’s diversification from home improvement retailing.The deal, if approved by shareholders and regulators, will more than double Home Depot’s professional supply business, which serves large-scale commercial and industrial customers.Home Depot’s expansion into the business-to-business sector highlights its search for fresh sources of growth as the US home improvement market moves closer to saturation.Under the deal, the largest in the company’s history, Home Depot will pay Hughes $46.50 a share in cash and take on $285m of debt. The agreement represented a 21 per cent premium over the closing price of Hughes Supply’s shares on Monday.Hughes Supply is the biggest of several similar businesses acquired by Home Depot over the past few years as it seeks to lead consolidation of the fragmented professional market.Last year, Home Depot spent more than $2bn buying business-to-business suppliers, including National Waterworks.

Other acquisitions have included White Cap, a builders’ supplier, and Maintenance Warehouse.Home Depot said the latest deal would increase annual revenues from its professional business to nearly $12bn – accounting for more than 10 per cent of the company total -– and contribute to earnings in the first year.David Strasser, analyst at Bank of America, said the deal made “good strategic sense”, adding that Home Depot now had a platform in almost every part of the professional supply sector. But he said there remained room for growth, pointing out that the company’s share of the $410bn market would be only 3 per cent even after the acquisition.Joe DeAngelo, executive vice-president of the professional supply division, said Home Depot wanted to repeat in the business-to-business sector the same market transformation it had pioneered in the do-it-yourself retail space over the past 28 years.Analysts have noted that profit margins in the professional sector are lower than in consumer retailing. But Home Depot believes that by building a nationwide network of professional businesses it will have the buying power and synergies to increase profitability. The professional division is operated as a different business from the core retail operation, with separate supply chains and retail outlets and, in most cases, a separate brand.Investors signalled approval of Home Depot’s strategy, pushing its share price up more than 2 per cent to close at $41.80. Shares in Hughes Supply were up 18 per cent at $45.61.For the 2005 fiscal year Hughes Supply reported revenues of $4.4bn and net earnings of $123.7m."
489;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
490;HD;Home Depot;2006-01-10T22:24:16Z;Home Depot looks for space to grow;;For many US homeowners, visiting Home Depot at the weekend has become almost as much a part of American life as going to church. It is Home Depot, more than any other retailer, that keeps the country’s cherished suburbia looking smart and running smoothly through its huge range of home improvement products.But 28 years after opening its first store in Atlanta, the company is running out of fresh locations for its warehouse-style outlets. Last month, Home Depot opened its 2,000th store and the rate of expansion has been slowing in the US. As the domestic market draws closer to saturation, finding fresh sources of growth has become an increasing priority for Bob Nardelli, chief executive.Tuesday’s $3.47bn deal to buy Hughes Supply, a large distributor of construction and maintenance products, marks the company’s boldest step away from its core retail operation.The acquisition, if approved by shareholders and regulators, will further expand Home Depot’s reach beyond amateur do-it-yourself enthusiasts to large-scale building and maintenance contractors.Mr Nardelli has long trumpeted the attractions of the $410bn professional market, which is more than twice the size of the home improvement sector. For every dollar spent by consumers on home improvement, professionals spend three.But however great the opportunity in business-to-business supplies, Home Depot knows it must find ways to maintain growth in its core retailing business if the company is to remain healthy. Even after the Hughes Supply deal, at least 85 per cent of revenues will still come from consumers.As new store openings slow, the company is shifting its focus to increasing revenues from existing stores. It has widened its range of products and introduced more high-value items, such as home appliances. The strategy helped boost average spending per customer by 5.6 per cent to a record $58.21 in the first nine months of last year.Rapid growth in home installation services, such as flooring and kitchen fitting, has also helped maintain momentum, as time-starved consumers seek help with home improvement projects. Revenues from home services increased by 21 per cent to $1.2bn in the third quarter.On Monday, Home Depot announced plans to expand its range of consumer services through the acquisition of Chem-Dry, which operates 4,000 carpet and upholstery cleaning franchises.Another source of fresh growth is overseas expansion. Home Depot has already opened dozens of stores in Canada and Mexico and is planning to enter China.There has also long been speculation that the company could expand into Europe through the acquisition of UK-based Kingfisher, the dominant European home improvement retailer. But, following Tuesday’s deal, analysts questioning whether Home Depot had the financial strength or management capability to conduct another large acquisition any time soon.In addition to generating growth, Home Depot’s expansion overseas and diversification at home has another important advantage – reducing exposure to the cyclical US housing market. The company has benefited from several years of surging house prices and new home building, which has encouraged increased spending on home improvements.There have been signs, however, that the real estate market is slowing, raising fears that 2006 could be a tougher year for the home improvement sector.Lowe’s, the second largest US home improvement retailer, has shown no interest in following Home Depot into professional supplies. But with less than 1,200 stores compared to its rival’s 2,000, the company has more growth opportunities remaining in its core business.

Having traded lower for most of the day, the shares ended flat at $56.84.However, Apple jumped 6.3 per cent to $80.86, a fresh all-time high, after chief executive Steve Jobs told the MacWorld show in San Francisco that revenues would be way ahead of Wall Street expectations in the fourth-quarter.Hughes Supply jumped 18.3 per cent to $45.61 after Home Depot agreed a $3.5bn deal for the distributor of construction supplies. Home Depot rose 2.4 per cent to $41.80, making it the biggest Dow gainer.Toymaker Hasbro gained 6.8 per cent gain to $21.56 after the stock was upgraded by broker Piper Jaffray, while a hike in full-year earnings guidance sent shares in Phillips Van Heusen, owner of the Calvin Klein and Kenneth Cole fashion brands, 8.9 per cent higher to $36.41.
492;HD;Home Depot;2005-11-24T17:43:25Z;Builders strength reflects US economy;;US homebuilding stocks had completed a swift recovery by the time trading halted on Wednesday ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.The Philadelphia Stock Exchange housing index closed at 527.29, a rally of 9.5 per cent in two weeks since a profits warning from Toll Brothers, one of the largest luxury homebuilders sparked the worst sell-off in the sector for more than three years.The sector is now closely watched not only for the strength of the homebuilders’ stocks, but also as an indicator of the broader economy. Many economists attribute US consumers’ surprisingly resilient spending to a “wealth effect” caused by the rise in residential real estate prices.If this is correct, a sharp reduction in housing prices could also have a significant impact on the economy, and on the rest of the stock market. Any knock-on effect on spending habits could soon become apparent, because today is the beginning of the US holiday shopping season.The PSE housing index had risen more than 150 per cent in the past three years on the back of the housing boom, before hitting turbulence in the past few months.Home retailers have benefited from strong housing prices. Home Depot, a star of the 1990s, has been revived by the housing boom, with its share price doubling since the beginning of 2003.The sell-off on November 8 was its greatest single-day decline in three years, and saw selling across the sector as investors interpreted the revised forecast from Toll Brothers as a sign that the bubble was finally bursting. Benign economic data and speculation that the cycle of monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve is coming to an end have helped ease sentiment since then.Despite this rebound of the past two weeks, concern over the sector seems to be growing. Ajay Kapur, global strategist at Citigroup, has called for an underweighting of US homebuilders, with a shift to UK counterparts, and to luxury goods. He said: “The handover of the asset inflation baton, from housing to equities, which we expect, should be relatively favourable to luxury related industries. Slowing house price inflation could lead to lower rates of retail sales for businesses exposed to middle and low-income earners.”Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management has put together a structured note that will rise in value if there is a fall in the price of a basket of stocks in homebuilders and home retailers.Benjamin Pace, Deutsche’s chief investment officer, said the the notes offered a “near-term tactical call,” which had been guided by recent experience with peaks in the UK and Australia residential housing markets. He said: “Everyone knows that the big concern about a bubble now is in residential real estate. These homebuilder stocks have done so well for so many years, but as interest rate increases finally have an impact, you’ll begin to see a slowdown.”Opinions differ over the economic impact of lower house prices. Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, has suggested that a slowdown in the market could reduce gross domestic product growth by half a percentage point.John Lipsky, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase, said the importance of house prices had been over-estimated. He said: “Household net worth is not a real estate story in net terms. Non-real estate assets [such as shares in family-owned businesses and pension plans] have contributed most of the growth in net worth.”

The Nasdaq Composite index also fell 0.1 per cent to 2,200.95.Wal-Mart kicked off a busy week for retailers, most of which are expected to release quarterly results this week.The retail behemoth rose 0.6 per cent to $49.30 after it posted a 4 per cent jump in third quarter earnings, meeting market expectations.Solid third-quarter earnings also pushed home improvement retailer Lowes up 4.7 per cent to $64.89, while larger rival Home Depot rode its coat-tails, climbing 1.6 per cent to $42.57.In contrast, meat producer Tyson Foods came under pressure after third-quarter earnings fell below analyst expectations. Its shares tumbled 10.8 per cent to $16.51.Deal talk also swirled around Knight Ridder, the newspaper publisher. Its shares rose 1 per cent to $63.10 after the group said it was considering putting itself up for sale in response to mounting pressure from shareholders.Starwood Hotels and Resorts rose 1.3 per cent to $60.02 after it agreed to sell 38 of its properties to Host Marriott for about $4.1bn. Host Marriott fell 4.5 per cent to $16.65.Reports that talks of Computer Sciences’ possible sale to Lockheed Matin had stalled failed to rattle investors. CSC rose 4.1 per cent to $55 on the news, while Lockheed edged up 0.7 per cent to to $59.79.Elsewhere, blue chip heavyweights Hewlett-Packard and Motorola respectively fell 1.1 per cent to $28.20 and 3 per cent to $22.86 after the two companies had their ratings downgraded by sector analysts.
494;HD;Home Depot;2005-11-07T20:07:06Z;Lex: Praktiker;;"Less is more at Praktiker, the do-it-yourself chain being floated by Metro, Germany's biggest retailer. Over the past four years, new management has turned round the floundering DIY group by aggressively lowering prices while cutting the product range from 300,000 items to 72,000. In a depressed German market, this clearer focus has actually led to higher sales.Abroad, Praktiker has been moving east and south and is now market leader in Greece, Hungary, Turkey and Romania. International sales are growing in double digits, while operating margins, at 6.6 per cent, are four times higher than at home. Further expansion should boost group profits by 80 per cent between 2004 and 2008, according to JPMorgan, one of the banks underwriting the listing.Praktiker's record is not faultless. It has lost ground to rivals in Poland and double-digit margins in Greece look unsustainable. In Germany, the plan to further prune the store range to 65,000 items or less could start to turn off customers.The valuation takes account of these risks, however. At the mid-point of the €16-€19 price range, Praktiker's equity would be worth just over €1bn. Subtracting cash of about €220m following the listing leaves an €800m enterprise value. That equates to 5.6 times estimated 2006 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 20 per cent less than a peer group including Kingfisher and Home Depot. A sum-of-the-parts valuation suggests a similar one-fifth discount. For investors, less really should mean more.- Click here to add your comments

495;HD;Home Depot;2005-10-19T20:40:58Z;Solid earnings spark Wall Street rally;;Wall Street bulls triumphed over the ghosts of the 1987 market crash thanks to a broad rally on Wednesday afternoon, helped by enough strong corporate earnings to offset the weaker results.The Dow received strong support from United Technologies, the helicopters-to-elevators conglomerate, which rose 3.8 per cent to $51.84 after reporting strong profit growth and raised its full-year guidance.Home Depot helped push the Dow industrials higher, closing 3 per cent up at $39.30, while McDonald’s also beefed up the average with its 4.2 per cent gain to $33.84.These gains overshadowed the dour tone earlier set by two other Dow components.Honeywell, another conglomerate, fell 5.1 per cent to $34.09 after it gave a narrower guidance that distracted investors’ attention from news the industrial conglomerate achieved 26 per cent profit growth in the last three months.Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, said after the Tuesday close that revenue estimates were hampered by supply constraints and inventory build-up among its customers. Intel shares erased earlier losses amid the broader rally to close 0.2 per cent up at $23.67.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index, which had buckled under Intel’s pressure, also recovered to close virtually unchanged, with Teradyne’s 2.6 per cent advance to $14.29.News that crude and distillate inventories in the US had risen, which prompted a drop in energy prices, also provided relief.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 per cent at 10,408.45, while the S&P 500 index advanced 1.4 per cent to 1,195.13. The Nasdaq Composite finished 1.6 per cent ahead at 2,089.44.The broad rally flew in the face of a bearish call on homebuilders’ stocks issued by Analysts at Banc of America Securities as US government data showed construction of new homes rose sharply last month.The Dow Jones US Home Construction sector index shrugged off the call and closed 4.8 per cent ahead in spite of BofA’s downgrade of the sector’s outlook to “cautious” from “positive”. The bank’s analyst team pointed to several trends that indicate “further weakness in pricing trends in the months to come”.Shares in Toll Brothers put on 5.3 per cent to $39.17, while Hovnanian Enterprises was up 4.1 per cent to $46.64. NVR, whose rating was cut to “sell” from “buy”, gained 2.4 per cent to $696.05.Among financials, JPMorgan Chase announced a 78 per cent increase in net profits and saw its shares gain 2.9 per cent to $34.75.Meanwhile, Bank of America’s net profits rose 10 per cent last quarter, thanks to mortgage and credit card revenues, sending shares up 2 per cent to $42.42.The onslaught of banking earnings helped push the BKX sector index up 2 per cent by the close.Internet stocks were in focus after Yahoo, the largest internet portal operator, announced tepid profit growth and rising sales, sending shares up 6.6 per cent to $35.68 on the news. Ebay, which was due to report earnings after the close, gained 3.9 per cent to $42.01.
496;HD;Home Depot;2005-09-27T20:29:43Z;Wall St steady despite slide in confidence;;Taser International, the stun gun maker, saw its shares lose 13.1 per cent to $6.35 after it said the Securities and Exchange Commission was stepping up an investigation of the company to the point where it could subpoena documents.The decline came as Wall Street stocks proved that hope springs eternal by closing virtually unchanged in the wake of a report showing consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low.The report was the first evaluation of the impact of recent hurricanes on American consumers. It raised the prospect of slowing consumer expenditure in an economy that owed much of its recent expansion to the resilience of consumers and their willingness to borrow.David Rosenberg, economist at Merrill Lynch, noted this week that consumer discretionaries have been the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 this year and warned investors that there was a risk of disappointment next year, given that consensus forecasts see the sector as having the best earnings prospects in 2006. On the Dow Jones Industrial Average, initial declines in those stocks with more direct exposure to consumer spending patterns mostly faded away by the close. Thus, Wal-Mart, the retailer, was less than 0.1 per cent off at $43.10, while Home Depot lost 0.1 per cent to $38.39. McDonald’s lost 0.8 per cent to $33.01.By the close, this background saw a 0.1 per cent advance in the Dow to 10,456.21, while the S&P 500 index was flat at 1,215.66. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.2 per cent to 2,116.42.The day’s other data report appeared to do nothing to help sentiment, showing that new homes sales fell in August. However, homebuilders recouped some of their earlier losses.The news sent the Dow Jones US home construction index 0.6 per cent lower, with Toll Brothers down 1.6 per cent to $43.28. KB Home gave up 1.9 per cent to $72, Centex lost 0.8 per cent to $63.40 and DR Horton gave up 0.2 per cent to $35.50.Lennar, which reported above-expectation quarterly results after the Monday close, was 0.1 per cent off at $57.Other stocks in the news included ExxonMobil, which closed unchanged at $64.62 and Chevron, off 0.1 per cent at $64.18. The two oil groups received a downgrade and an upgrade respectively from analysts at JPMorgan.Meanwhile, in deal news, the shares of WellChoice rose 7 per cent to $75.51 after reports that WellPoint, the largest US health insurer, was set to acquire the company. WellPoint was 0.1 per cent lower at $75.01.News that profits grew by 7.3 per cent at Pepsi Bottling Group pushed the company’s shares up 3.1 per cent to $28.46.Movie Gallery, a DVD-rental chain, was 13.9 per cent lower at $11.04, not far from a fresh low point after the company announced that it would suspend its quarterly dividend in order to pay down debt. The stock is down almost 42 per cent for the year.Blockbuster, a rival, was down 1.3 per cent at $4.51.Netflix, which rents DVDs via the internet, improved by 1.4 per cent to $24.30.

498;HD;Home Depot;2005-08-31T22:06:34Z;Shippers warn of supply chain chaos;;Shippers on the Mississippi river are warning of disruption to supply chains and logistics across North America as the commercial impact of Hurricane Katrina extends far beyond initial worries about energy markets.The port of New Orleans, a major gateway for commodities from grain to steel, remains closed while damage to navigational aids and debris also prevents larger ocean-going vessels from entering the Mississippi.Rick Couch, president of Osprey shipping line, said: “This comes at a very bad time with the US agricultural harvest just a few weeks away. Some traffic can be diverted to Houston and ports upriver, but congestion is already building up.”Chemical plants and manufacturers have also warned that damage to local transport infrastructure could hinder recovery efforts after earlier shutdowns.Big US retailers have been pushing to restock and resupply their stores in the hurricane-affected areas, with Wal-Mart and Home Depot setting up emergency centres at their headquarters to co-ordinate operations.But the direct impact of the storm on sales at national chains will be offset by their comparatively limited exposure in Louisiana and Mississippi, whose combined population of around 7.5m is less than half the size of Florida’s 17.4m. New Orleans itself is the 35th largest retail market in the US in terms of square footage of retail space, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.Traditionally, hurricane damage has resulted in stronger sales for home improvement retailers.“I see complete disaster with flooding prevalent, so while Home Depot and Lowes might benefit in the longer term, in the short term I don’t think there’s going to be much of anything going on,” said Bill Sims, a retail analyst at Citigroup.Home builders and construction companies are also likely to benefit.Higher fuel prices and operational disruptions resulting from the storm will add to problems faced by struggling US airlines such as Delta Air Lines and Flyi, the parent company of Independence Air.“Delta is already bleeding cash and at near-term risk of insolvency. The added financial pressure may hasten an already likely bankruptcy filing, which will probably occur within weeks,” said Standard Poors, the debt ratings agency. “Closure of refineries…is already raising gasoline prices significantly and is having an effect on jet fuel, as well,” S&P said.
499;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Petco hit by customer savings on petrol;;Shares in Petco, the second largest US pet supply chain, fell more than 13 per cent on Thursday after it became the latest retailer to warn of the impact of higher fuel prices on sales at its 750 stores.Brian Devine, chairman, told analysts that customers were cutting back on visits to the store, apparently to save on fuel costs. “This consolidation of trips is cutting out a lot of those impulse items they would get on their second or third trips.”Petco forecast same-store sales would be flat to up 2 per cent during the third quarter as petrol prices continued to hit business.Petsmart, Petco’s larger rival, cited the impact of high petrol prices on customers when results on Wednesday missed analysts’ expectations. Petsmart, which had sales last year of $3.4bn against Petco’s $1.8bn, operates a similarly sized network of larger format stores.Timothy Kullman, chief financial officer, said Pet-smart believed “the consumer stayed at home for July and the first part of August” while also citing the impact of increasing competition in pet services from other mass retailers, including Home Depot.Both Petco and Petsmart expressed confidence in the continuing strength of the pet supplies market – supported by the rising demand of increased pet ownership by ageing baby-boomers.Both retailers continue to develop high-profit-margin services such as grooming, pet training and clinics.Petsmart reported its sales of services were up more than 20 per cent on the year at $75.1m, accounting for about 8 per cent of its total sales of $899m. Petco, with overall sales of $482m, said service sales increased 22 per cent.James Myers, Petco chief executive, said the fall-off in store visits did not call into question the company’s successful strategy.Phil Francis, chief executive of Petsmart, said the company, cautious about the prospects for the overall economy, remained “very positive about this business and its potential”.
500;HD;Home Depot;2005-08-16T18:08:36Z;Wall Street stumbles as earnings disappoint;;Wall Street was lower on Tuesday as some US heavyweights reported subdued earnings news and gave disappointing guidance for the current quarter.Oil prices remained a worry for investors amid signs that energy costs may be starting to hurt consumer spending.Wal-Mart shares dropped more than 3.3 per cent to $47.50 after the world’s largest retailer reported that second-quarter earnings rose 6 per cent but looked disappointing for the current quarter. Wal-Mart blamed the rising oil price for the subdued forecast.Consumer prices data showed US inflation growing at its fastest pace in three months, with a report pointing to the increase in petrol prices. Rising oil prices contributed to half the increase in headline consumer prices.Merrill Lynch economists suggested that the markets were not clipping along at the pace that most analysts think, and pointed to Wednesday’s data and earnings as evidence of the theory.“Look at days like today, when Wal-Mart is cautions on consumer spending because of the increase in oil prices,” said Kathleen Bostjancic, senior US economist at Merrill Lynch in New York.By mid-afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.8 per cent at 10,553.57. The S&P 500 was 0.7 per cent weaker at 1,224.98 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.9 per cent to 2,148.03.Gateway weighed on the markets after the company lowered its revenue and earnings forecasts for the full year. Shares declined 19.3 per cent to $3.14Two other US retailers, Home Depot and Staples, reported that sales surged in the second quarter. Home improvement chain Home Depot said profit jumped 20 per cent and same-store sales rose 4 per cent.Staples’ profit, meanwhile, shot up 20 per cent, 1 cent ahead of analysts’ expectations. But both stocks were trading lower, with shares in Home Depot down 1.4 per cent to $41.04. Staples shares were off 2.1 per cent to $21.85Goodyear Tire & Rubber dropped 3.3 per cent to $16.93 after saying it might face charges over accounting errors from two years ago. The company originally disclosed the SEC probe in 2003.Meanwhile, JPMorgan said the company had settled a lawsuit with Enron by paying the company $350m in cash. JPMorgan said the company did not expect the settlement to have a material impact on earnings. JPMorgan shares were up 0.5 per cent to $34.81The airline sector enjoyed some relief, with the Amex airline index increasing 3.4 per cent after declining eight of the last 11 trading days. Delta, Northwest, and SkyWest all helped to lift the index, with Delta increasing 9.4 per cent to $1.52. Northwest rose 10.6 per cent to $4.61 and SkyWest was up 11 per cent to $24.46.Other US data out on Tuesday showed July housing starts in the US were down 0.1 per cent, in line with economists’ expectations.
501;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Soaring oil will hurt spending, says Wal-Mart;;Lee Scott, chief executive of Wal-Mart, on Tuesday sounded the alarm over the impact of higher fuel prices on US consumers, highlighting the risks to spending by the discount retailer’s core lower-income customers.“The only real economic concern I have is that oil prices will erase improvements in employment and real income for a portion of our customer base …an important portion of our customer base,” Mr Scott said in a prerecorded statement on the company’s second-quarter results. “So I anticipate we will face challenges as the year proceeds,” he added.Wal-Mart’s cautious outlook for the coming quarter combined with sluggish second quarter results from the world’s largest retailer to send its share price down more than 3 per cent in New York, to $47.41. The company said second-quarter earnings rose 5.8 per cent to $2.8bn, or 67 cents per share, while sales increased 10.2 per cent to $76.8bn.In spite of the threat to the spending power of its customers posed by fuel costs, Mr Scott said that inflation “appears to be well under control”, and that the price of a typical basket of goods at Wal-Mart’s discount stores was unchanged from a year ago.But Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, also noted that higher fuel costs meant the company’s trucking fleet - the biggest in the US - had spent an additional $30m moving goods to its stores during the quarter. In addition, the costs of providing light and power to its network of more than 3,500 US stores had increased by more than $100m.Wal-Mart’s immediate concerns over fuel prices contrast with other major retailers, including Home Depot, which reported on Tuesday, and Target, its main discount rival, reflecting its dependence on a customer base for whom fuel prices make up a larger proportion of discretionary spending. US petrol pump prices have risen around 8 per cent during the last month.Emme Kozloff, analyst at Sanford CBernstein, estimates that higher petrol prices in the remainder of the year will add about $31 a month to household costs, against $25 a month in the first six months of the year.Wal-Mart initially responded to rising fuel price pressures with additional bargains. It is now trying to attract better-off customers, with higher quality products.Wal-Mart said its international division had again been hit by continuing problems at its Asda subsidiary in the UK, with its growth at stores open at least a year “essentially flat” during the quarter. The group also announced a $36m restructuring charge following Asda’s move to reduce management staff in favour of more store-level jobs.
502;HD;Home Depot;2005-08-16T13:02:56Z;Home Depot lifts forecast as profits jump 17%;;Home Depot increased its full-year earnings forecast after announcing a better-than-expected 17 per cent jump in second quarter profits.The results, which came a day after rival Lowe's reported a 20 per cent improvement in earnings, showed how home improvement remains one of the fastest-growing parts of the US retail sector.Bob Nardelli, chairman and chief executive, attributed the strong performance to increased store efficiency, a widening product portfolio and growth in the company's services and professional supplies businesses.Net profits were $1.8bn, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.5bn, or 70 cents a share in the same period last year. Analysts had expected, on average, 79 cents a share.Revenues were $22.3bn, up nearly 12 per cent. Comparable store sales - those made in outlets open more than a year - increased by 4 per cent.The company affirmed its full-year forecast of 9-12 per cent sales growth and increased its earnings growth target from 10-14 per cent to 14-17 per cent.Average ticket prices - the average amount spent by each customer - increased by 5.1 per cent to a record $57.54, as the company sold more high-value products and brands, such as Ralph Lauren paints, Hampton Bay patio furniture and LG household appliances.Both Home Depot and Lowe's have been expanding beyond their traditional product lines into areas such as appliances. Home Depot said its share of the appliance market had reached 8.8 per cent.Sales of home installation services grew 28 per cent, with strong demand for roofing, countertops, kitchens, windows and flooring. These services have attracted new customers without the time or skill to execute home improvement projects on their own.Home Depot opened 44 new stores during the quarter, lifting its total to 1,940 in the US, Canada and Mexico. Plans are under way to enter the Chinese market.The company's professional supplies business registered double-digit sales growth and now accounts for about 4 per cent of total revenues following a series of acquisitions. Home Depot Supply sells construction and maintenance products to professionals.

The company also reported higher quarterly net earnings and said it would sell its stake in Lumileds to Philips for $950m, spin off its SOC and memory test business next year, and begin a $4bn stock repurchase.The market remained umimpressed, however, and at midday the S&P 500 was up just 0.2 per cent at 1,232.96, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 2,166.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent at 10,623.23.A slight fall in oil prices helped bolster the market, which had been concerned about several consecutive days of record highs, culminating with Friday’s peak of $67.10. The September crude contract fell 21 cents to $66.65 a barrel.“We are now firmly in the doldrums part of the year,” said Sarah Hunt, senior vice president at Capital Management Associates. “We’re through the earnings season, a lot of people have simply left town and there isn’t much information coming out at the moment.”Two of the day’s most dramatic moves were triggered by unconfirmed stories in the press. Delta Airlines became the biggest loser on the S&P 500 after the airline was reported by the New York Times to be lining up financing for bankruptcy protection. Shares in the troubled airline, which has been on deathwatch by the markets for weeks, fell 16.2 per cent to $1.35.Also, the New York Post reported that Dow Jones, the financial news publisher that owns the Wall Street Journal, may be up for sale. Shares gained 15.4 per cent to $42.77, making it the biggest percentage change in the S&P 500.Also in the media sector, Time Warner gained 1.5 per cent to $18.52 after it emerged that four major investors, including billionaire Carl Icahn, had gained a major stake in the company and were intending to pressure the board to buy back $20bn in stock and spin off the cable business.In retail, Lowe’s, the world’s second biggest home improvement retailer, raised its annual profit forecast after new store openings and demand for kitchens boosted second-quarter profits by 20 per cent. However, the shares gained just 0.1 per cent to $65.27.Wal-Mart was up slightly after saying it continued to expect August same-store sale growth to remain within its previous forecast of 3-5 per cent. Its shares gained 0.4 per cent to $48.91.Home Depot is due to report its results on Tuesday, with analysts expecting to say that second-quarter net income rose 12 per cent. Its shares were up 1.1 per cent at $41.72.
504;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Lowe’s profits growth beats forecasts;;Continued strength in the US housing market helped Lowe’s increase its second quarter net profits by a better-than-expected 20 per cent.The results underlined Lowe’s status as one of the fastest-growing US retailers as it challenges Home Depot for dominance of the home improvement sector.Robert Niblock, chairman and chief executive, attributed the strong performance to “favourable social and demographic trends [and] a robust housing market”.Steady economic and population growth in the US is supporting increased spending on home improvement as incomes rise and home ownership widens.Net earnings were $838m, or $1.05 a share, up from $700m, or 87 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Analysts had expected, on average, $1.02 a share.Household appliances, such as washing machines and refrigerators, were among the strongest sources of growth, showing how Lowe’s is diversifying beyond traditional home improvement products.The company is also luring new customers by offering home installation services for those lacking the time or skill to carry out their own home improvements.Revenues increased 17.3 per cent to $11.9bn, up from $10.2bn last year. Comparable store sales - those made in outlets open for more than a year - were up 6.5 per cent.The results marked a strong comeback from the company’s sluggish first quarter, when unusually cold and wet weather damped down sales.Second quarter performance was helped by above-average temperatures that encouraged sales of air conditioners and outdoor energy equipment.Lowe’s opened 27 new stores during the three months ended July 29, bringing its total to 1,138 - a 13.7 per cent increase over last year.Both Lowe’s and Home Depot, which has nearly 2,000 outlets, have been rapidly increasing their number of stores over recent years to meet growing demand and reach new markets.Earlier this year Lowe’s announced plans to join Home Depot in the Canadian market.Shares in Lowe’s were up 2.16 per cent at $66.60.
505;HD;Home Depot;2005-08-11T19:35:02Z;Short View: 13 Ways of Looking at Warren Buffett;;"Wall Street and the City of London are engaged in a familiar exercise: 13 Ways of Looking at a Warren Buffett Investment.Regulatory filings show Geico, an insurance firm owned by Mr Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, has purchased shares in both Home Depot and Kingfisher, the UK retailer that includes B&Q, the DIY chain. While it isn't clear whether he was involved in the purchases - Berkshire, in time-honoured custom, didn't return a call for comment - that hasn't stopped all manner of explanations.To wit: I. Mr Buffett is playing matchmaker. He has been a deal facilitator between big entities in which he owns stakes, such as Disney and Cap Cities.II. A Home Depot-Kingfisher marriage will finally happen. Ever since the early 1990s, Home Depot has been alternately portrayed as Kingfisher's conqueror or suitor. Last year CEO Bob Nardelli said the falling dollar and Kingfisher's rising stock made a deal improbable. The dollar has strengthened and Kingfisher has weakened.III. Mr Buffett may embark on another industry-wide ""roll-up"" akin to his Mid-American Energy deal in the late 1990s. This seems unlikely, given Home Depot's $89bn market cap.IV. Mr Buffett is bullish on the housing market. He was a timely investor in housing-related retailers five years ago.V. Mr Buffett is sticking to his core competencies.VI. Concerns about retailers and the ailing consumer may be overblown, if Mr Buffett's bets are correct.VII. The Kingfisher purchase may mean Mr Buffett, who frets about US valuations, is looking abroad for opportunities.VIII. Mr Buffett doesn't make every decision at his vast empire; these may be Geico allocator Lou Simpson's deals.IX. These deals expand Mr Buffett's ""working-class index"": manufactured housing, discount-furniture, Dairy Queen, and so on. Perhaps coastal investors are missing the picture.X. These stakes coincide with other long-term Berkshire plays and may be stepping stones in a larger strategy.XI. Kingfisher is a currency hedge for the dollar-bearish Mr Buffett.XII. Mr Buffett needs to find outlets for his $45bn cash hoard.XIII. The purchases don't mean anything; it's August."
506;HD;Home Depot;2005-08-10T23:43:37Z;Lex: Whirlpool/Maytag;;A buyer bidding against himself is every auctioneer's dream. Since entering the battle for Maytag, domestic appliance maker Whirlpool has raised three times with no new bids from rival suitor Ripplewood. Yet it is not as bizarre as it seems. Wednesday’s increase to $21 a share appears to have come in response to Ripplewood's plan to raise its bid from $14 to $15.50.More importantly, Whirlpool has needed to convince the Maytag board that it is offering enough to offset the risk of regulators blocking the deal. At best, it will close next year. At worst, it will not close at all. Ripplewood in contrast is offering cash, now.The Maytag board is right to worry. A combined group would have uncomfortably high market shares, particularly in the laundry segment. Arguably, barriers to entry are low for Asian domestic appliances makers, and retailers such as Home Depot are big enough to look after themselves. However, strong brands and distribution clout are important. In fact, Whirlpool has tacitly admitted the scale of the regulatory risk by offering such a premium to Ripplewood's bid.If Whirlpool wins, the regulatory process could drag well into next year. If the deal were then blocked, Whirlpool would pay Maytag $120m. But the delay could have caused serious damage to Maytag's business. Its shares are now trading at $19 a 10 per cent discount to Whirlpool's offer. If Whirlpool is not forced higher, that feels too narrow to justify the risks involved.
507;HD;Home Depot;2005-07-14T17:55:36Z;Kingfisher bid hopes lead FTSE higher;;Fresh demand for oil stocks kept the FTSE 100 on an upward trajectory on Thursday.Despite the sector’s strong run in 2005, UBS forecast that there was still some upside as it raised its 2005-2007 crude oil price forecasts.Although the broker admitted it wasn’t a major bull on the sector, the upgrade to its crude forecasts resulted in double digit percentage increases to the price targets of the three main UK oil stocks.BP’s price target was pushed up 13 per cent to 700p, sending its shares up 0.6 per cent to 625½p. Shell and BG Group, upgraded by 14 per cent, rose 0.8 per cent to 549p and 0.1 per cent to 469¼p respectively.Overall, the FTSE 100 rose 13.8 points to 5,259.7, while the FTSE 250 index shed 33.0 points at 7,508.7. Volume was a solid 3.5bn shares.Further weak economic data only served to reinforce the feeling that a UK interest rate cut would come sooner rather than later. Service companies’ domestic sales fell to their lowest level in six years in the second quarter, the British Chambers of Commerce said.Financial stocks also continued to find fresh backers. In addition to further gains for the banking sector, asset management group Schroders rose 2 per cent to 810½p, while hedge fund manager Man Group was 1.9 per cent stronger at £15.46.Home improvement chain Kingfisher rose 2.4 per cent to 253½p as rumours of a takeover of the B&Q owner did the rounds again. The plumbing goods supplier Wolseley, 1.3 per cent lower at £11.86, or Home Depot, the US home improvement chain, were the names in the frame.East Asian focused bank Standard Chartered rose 1.3 per cent to £10.90 after Credit Suisse First Boston said the acquisition of Korea First Bank and hints of an improvement in the Hong Kong banking market provided a material boost to the valuation and upgraded its rating to “outperform” from “neutral”.EMAP added 2.6 per cent to 826½p, its highest level in three months, as the chairman told its annual shareholders meeting that it had bucked the sluggish advertising market trend and remained in line to beat full-year expectations for the group.Compass Group climbed 1.7 per cent to 244¾p after analysts at Citigroup raised their recommendation on the world’s largest contract caterer to “buy” from “hold” and increased their target price for the group from 240p to 300p.“A cultural revolution is in progress at Compass,” said Adrian Cattley of Citigroup. “The business is changing its focus to cash generation and the sensible use of capital.”But Bovis Homes, down 5.2 per cent to 654p, cast a shadow on the UK housebuilding sector when it warned of a 10 per cent drop in average selling prices in the first half. At the same time, it reported a 16 per cent fall in the number of houses it sold. See more on BovisAnalysts said the update was likely to result in earnings downgrades of at least 10 per cent. Bovis is becoming more involved in the provision of social housing, which is expected to increase pressure on margins. In its defence, analysts point to its solid dividend growth and the fact that it has the best land-bank in the sector.The news put pressure on other builders, with Bellway off 3 per cent at 855½p and George Wimpey down 2.5 per cent at 432 ¾p.Supermarket group Somerfield gained 0.5 per cent to 198¼p as investors hoped for a quick end to the protracted takeover discussions.

However, trading in the first three weeks of our second quarter continues to be challenging in the UK and France.”The bleak outlook echoed that of other troubled high street retailers, including Boots and Wm Morrison. Even retailers who have been consistently delivering sales growth for years, such as Argos, the catalogue store owned by GUS, and Next, the clothing retailer, have recently reported sales declines.In the first quarter to April 30, retail profit fell 15.6 per cent to £125.9m, in line with an earlier profits warning. Total sales rose 2.2 per cent to £1.94bn but like-for-like sales declined 5.6 per cent.At B&Q, Kingfisher’s UK chain, retail profit fell 16.5 per cent to £73.2m while sales experienced a like-for-like decline of 7.7 per cent to £1bn. The retail margin fell from 8.2 per cent to 7.1 per cent. Kingfisher claimed, however, that B&Q retained market share.B&Q has been the subject of recent bid rumours, with the US DIY chain Home Depot and private equity buyers named as possible bidders. Mr Murphy, however, denied on Thursday that it was up for sale.Kingfisher’s French operation Castorama also suffered in the quarter, as retail profit fell 27.3 per cent to £20.2m and like-for-like sales were down 4.4 per cent to £382.3m. The company said this was due to discounting and poor weather.Overall, like-for-like sales in France grew 1.2 per cent as growth at Kingfisher’s discount builders merchant Brico Depot offset weakness at Castorama.Total sales outside the UK, Ireland and France rose 3.9 per cent but fell 17.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis to £185.8m, with as weaker sales in Poland offet strong sales in China and Italy. Retail profit fell 40.4 per cent to £9.9m.Shares fell 2¼p to 254¾p in early morning trade in London.

However, things turned sour, as they so often do, and in 2000 he ended up closing the funds after a run of poor returns and investor withdrawals.Since then, the 70-something Robertson has enjoyed an active retirement, building a golf course in New Zealand, among other things. He still has an office in New York and has put seed money into several hedge funds.The hedge fund world is more crowded than it was in the 1990s, but Yusko sees Robertson's name alone as a competitive advantage.""Partnering with Julian creates a unique set of relationships and the ability to access managers that some other funds of funds won't have,"" he told Bloomberg.Sales stormFor most businesses in the US south-east, hurricanes are an annual menace. But for Home Depot and Lowe's, they are an opportunity.The do-it-yourself retailers experience a spike in sales whenever rough weather strikes, as homeowners rush to board up their windows beforehand and repair damage afterwards. Last year was a particularly busy one as four powerful hurricanes blasted the region.Both are now readying for this year's storm season, which starts next week. Home Depot has forged a partnership with the American Red Cross to educate people about hurricane preparedness and sell co-branded products, such as first-aid kits and emergency lighting.Not to be outdone, Lowe's is to hold daily ""how-to"" clinics in its Florida stores, teaching customers how to build hurricane shelters and other essentials.Florida Governor Jeb Bush has signalled his approval for the initiatives by removing sales taxes from a range of ""hurricane preparedness products"".What could be next in the quest for hurricane readiness - selling the naming rights to approaching storms? Coming soon: Hurricane Hammer, sponsored by Home Depot.School prideIt has been pointed out before that Chuck Schumer, Democratic senator from New York, and Norm Coleman, Republican senator from Minnesota, are both proud graduates of James Madison High School in Brooklyn.But Schumer was singing the school song (figuratively) again on Wednesday, hopeful that the Senate's Madison caucus will soon increase. He pointed out that Bernie Sanders - the Vermont socialist who runs as an independent and usually votes with Democrats - also went to Madison High School.Sanders, now in the House, is running for the Senate seat left open by the retirement of Jim Jeffords. And Schumer is running the Senate Democrats' campaign machine. If Sanders wins, maybe Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, another Madison grad, can swear him in.observer@ft.com"

I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD).

Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
516;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Former CSFB chief looks at bid for NYSE;;The New York Stock Exchange faced a new challenge to its plan to go public on Monday when John Mack, former head of Credit Suisse First Boston, agreed to canvass support for a bid for the exchange.Mr Mack, one of the most respected figures on Wall Street, has joined forces with Ken Langone, a controversial former director of the NYSE, to gauge interest in a rival deal.Mr Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot, on Monday hosted a meeting attended by representatives of leading brokers and hedge funds, including Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Wachovia, Bear Stearns, JPMorgan Chase, Duquesne Capital and Pequot Capital. “This is a process to determine the value of the exchange,” Mr Mack said.If there was sufficient interest by Tuesday, Mr Mack said the group would hire Richard Barrett, a former top CSFB banker, to explore an offer.Mr Langone had called Mr Mack in Beijing to ask if he would consider being chief executive of the exchange if a bid succeeded. People close to Mr Mack said he declined but agreed to listen to ideas.Mr Langone, who is willing to put up some of his own money for a bid, is exploiting concerns on Wall Street about the NYSE's proposal to acquire Archipelago, the electronic exchange, in a deal that would turn the member-owned NYSE into a publicly traded company.The NYSE said its plan was fair and “in the very best interest of the NYSE, our members and the competitive position of US financial markets”.Separately, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange on Monday said it had turned down a $50m bid last week, understood to be from Archipelago Holdings. Meyer “Sandy” Frucher, chairman of the exchange, who declined to confirm Archipelago's involvement, said regional exchanges were “on life support”.
517;HD;Home Depot;2005-04-24T23:22:47Z;Brokers threaten to quit NYSE over listing;;"Some of the New York Stock Exchange's biggest users are furious at the reverse takeover and public listing it proposed last week and are threatening to take their business elsewhere unless their concerns are resolved.The big Wall Street brokers are angry at the role played by their rival Goldman Sachs in arranging the proposed takeover of Archipelago and some argue that they should receive more of the value of NYSE.These brokers say their order flow creates the value at NYSE and that they could take their business elsewhere. ""We hold all the cards,"" said a senior executive at one of NYSE's biggest users.However, someone close to the deal pointed out that the controversial ""trade-through rule"" meant brokers must direct their orders to the exchange offering the best price. ""They just don't have that power,"" he said.Ken Langone, co-founder of Home Depot and a former NYSE director, hopes to exploit these concerns to generate support for a rival offer for NYSE. He has contacted a number of Wall Street chief executives to try to interest them in a bid, according to people familiar with his plans.""We are sufficiently irritated to listen to what he has got to say,"" said an executive at a leading investment bank.He believes he can come up with a bid that offers better value for members and for the investment banks that direct their business to the exchange.NYSE's plan has also run into opposition from Fidelity, the biggest US mutual fund manager, which is consider challenging the deal on the grounds that it would reduce competition, according to a senior executive. John Thain, chief executive of NYSE, stunned Wall Street last Wednesday by announcing plans to merge with Archipelago, an electronic exchange, in a deal that would turn member-owned NYSE into a publicly traded company.The reaction to the proposal has underlined the difficulty Mr Thain faces in satisfying the many competing interests that have a stake in the deal. Some of the 1,366 seatholders that own the exchange have expressed concern, even though they will receive cash and shares worth an implied $2.4m each.Goldman Sachs's investment banking rivals, which are also the biggest users of the exchange, were incensed at the potential conflicts in the role of the bank where Mr Thain was president. Goldman advised both NYSE and Archipelago, in which it also has a 15 per cent stake.Aside from the concerns about Goldman's role, some of the leading brokers have welcomed the deal. But others are angry at the terms and at least one chief executive of a big Wall Street firm has phoned Mr Thain to protest. A senior executive at one firm said it was unhappy that all the value was going to the seatholders, rather than the users.He said the big brokers had an effective veto on the deal because they could take their order flow elsewhere. ""Nothing can happen until we say it can,"" he said. But an adviser to the deal questioned that assessment. The trade-through rule severely limits the ability of brokers to choose where their orders are executed, he said. NYSE declined to comment on Sunday."

This week, New York hoped to even the score by rolling out the American version of royalty: Hollywood celebrities.The setting was Michael Bloomberg's posh townhouse, where he fed the visiting International Olympic Committee members roast turkey and stuffing.Helping the mayor make his pitch were the film stars Meryl Streep, Whoopi Goldberg and Matt Damon. Paul Simon provided the music, dusting off old chestnuts such as “The Boxer” and “Mrs Robinson”.Henry Kissinger was on hand to add a bit of gravitas. (It also doesn't hurt that Kissinger was on the IOC's reform committee in 2000.)Bloomberg can only hope that the star treatment will help the IOC members overlook the uncertainty surrounding New York's plan to build an Olympic stadium.Reporters posed unwelcome questions about the stadium during the IOC's four-day tour, clearly testing organisers' patience.But Bloomberg must have been heartened to hear that French trade unions were sticking with plans for a day of strikes and demonstrations just as the IOC arrives in Paris, the favourite to win the bid.Home-land securityHome Depot's appointment of Tom Ridge, former Secretary of Homeland Security, to its board deepens an already friendly relationship between the home improvement retailer and the Bush administration.Bob Nardelli, Home Depot's chief, hosted an election fundraiser for the President at his Atlanta home and the company was a big donor to his second inauguration last month.But could Ridge's appointment be payback for the boost he gave to sales of duct tape and plastic sheeting during his time at the DHS? It was under Ridge's leadership that the department advised Americans to keep the products in their homes to seal doors and windows in the case of a biological terrorist attack.The suggestion was widely ridiculed in the media but many people rushed to their nearest Home Depot to buy the provisions.Poaching seasonIt's high season for investment banker poaching on Wall Street.Lehman Brothers, Bank of America, Greenhill, Deutsche Bank and others have put the word out that they are looking for senior bankers with strong contact lists.Retail banks, eager to expand their investment banking operations, are offering some of the biggest pay packages. Offers are guaranteed and can be two and even three times current pay.A few poaches happened this week. Yesterday, HSBC Securities said it had hired Anthony Ianno and Christopher Lowe as managing directors and co-heads of the Americas energy and utilities sector from JP Morgan Chase.Observer expects to see more announcements in the coming weeks. After all, now is the time when bankers have fully contemplated the full significance of their bonus from last year and are ready to entertain other offers.Put-ted historyGeorge W. Bush promised to relay the concerns of the three Baltic states to Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, at their summit in Bratislava on Thursday.Putin himself added to those concerns in an interview with Slovak radio when he offered an inventive interpretation of the Nazi-Soviet pact of 1939, which agreed Russia should annex Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.Putin claimed that the Soviet Union signed the pact to “safeguard its interests and security of its western borders” after the 1938 Munich agreement. “If we look at the problem in this context, it looks quite different,” he said.Not to Lithuania. “The protection of one's interests may not serve as an excuse for annexation of another sovereign country,” said its foreign ministry on Thursday. It also noted that the USSR's legislature declared the secret annexation protocols void in 1989.Is that what Putin was referring to when he said: “I would recommend new historians, or rather those who want to rewrite history, to learn to read books before they rewrite or write them?” The Baltics hope not.ClampdownChina has long exported antiques, textiles, and all kinds of gadgets that end up in homes around the world. But the Chinese government is now encouraging its employees to export one of its oldest products: a lack of free speech.The Washington National Press Club recently went public with the news that the Chinese embassy had asked it to clamp down on one of its press events.According to the club's January newsletter, Sun Weide, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, called and e-mailed the club in advance of a December press event involving Epoch Times. His complaint: the paper was a “propaganda tool” of the “evil cult” Falun Gong movement.The press club instead clamped down on Sun's request. “We would never bow to a request to silence anyone,” wrote John Donnelly, chairman of its board of governors.Three KimsThey say good things come in threes and that's exactly what Kim Jong-il is telling North Koreans.

519;HD;Home Depot;2005-02-22T22:26:28Z;Market Overview: Dollar dives as oil scales $50 again;;The dollar tumbled against the euro and yen on Tuesday and crude oil prices rose back above the $50 a barrel barrier, making for a turbulent day in world markets.The dollar’s fall came after South Korea said it planned to diversify its reserves – the world’s fourth largest – into a greater variety of currencies. The move immediately raised worries that other countries could follow, while the weaker dollar prompted concerns about foreigners shifting investments out of US assets.A sceptical Julian Jessop at Capital Economics welcomed the dollar’s slide and said it would fall further. However, he cautioned that yesterday’s weakness was for the wrong reason: “Korea has said its plans are driven by the search for yield rather than concerns about the valuation of the dollar. Hence, this may be a good reason to sell the US currency against higher yielders like the Australian dollar or sterling. But it is a weak argument for selling against the euro and yen, where yields are lower.”In oil markets, US April crude leapt above $50 as the US north-east and Europe were hit by blasts of cold weather and in response to the weakening dollar. The impact on equities was swift. Wall Street suffered its sharpest decline for the year. By close of trade the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.6 per cent at 10,611.20, weighed down by a sharp fall in Home Depot.The world’s largest home improvement retailer posted higher quarterly profit that matched estimates, but analysts said the group’s margins had raised concern.The Nasdaq Composite eased 1.4 per cent, as favourable brokerage research on Apple Computer and Intel put a floor under tech stocks.Anais Faraj at Nomura International said yesterday that after an excellent recovery in US equities, it was probably time for a brief consolidation before the bulls tested the upside again.“Fundamentally, the outlook remains bullish, with earnings upgrades starting to dominate again even as investor sentiment remains very cautious. With correlations between the US and the rest of the world rising again, good news on Wall Street is certain to be reflected elsewhere. The difference, of course, is that nowadays the US market appears to be chasing the growth generated elsewhere.”European equities suffered their biggest one-day setback for more than six weeks as Spain’s Repsol reported an unexpected drop in net profits and said a review had shown a 4.1 per cent decline in its proven reserves. Repsol shares fell sharply on the news while Royal Dutch/Shell was also lower in spite of the latest resurgence in oil prices. The Anglo-Dutch group is still struggling to rebuild investor confidence after last year’s reserves over-booking scandal.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.7 per cent to 1,090.85, its biggest one-day fall since the end of October.Earlier, Asian equity markets were broadly lower as worries over corporate earnings took hold and the weaker dollar hurt export sectors. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 Average fell 0.5 per cent, dragged down after Citizen Watch cut its earnings estimates for the year.While equities struggled, gold sprinted to its highest level for almost two months, above $430 an ounce. Many operators believe the bullion price has further to climb as the dollar’s weakness makes gold increasingly attractive to non-US investors.Silver pushed up to a six-week high, lifted by gold’s rise and gains in the industrial metals market, where copper futures touched 16-year highs.
520;HD;Home Depot;2005-02-15T18:47:14Z;Soldiers for the Home front;;"After passing through the entrance hall at Home Depot's headquarters in Atlanta, visitors walk down a long corridor lined on both sides by hundreds of blue stars. Printed on each is the name of a Home Depot employee serving in the US armed forces in Iraq or Afghanistan. At the end of the corridor is a glass case containing a folded Stars and Stripes and a picture of 1st Lt Michael Vega, so far the only Home Depot employee killed in the wars.Nearly 2,000 Home Depot employees have been called up for active duty as reservists or National Guardsmen since the start of the US war against terror. Some companies might baulk at the disruption and cost caused by such a drain on their human resources. But for Home Depot, it is a source of pride.""It's part of this company's value system to support the military,"" says Dennis Donovan, Home Depot's executive vice-president for human resources. ""When you walk into work each day and see all those blue stars, it reminds us of the people working to protect our freedom.""Supporting the military fits the image of a home improvement retailer whose stores are concentrated in America's patriotic, Republican-voting heartland. But there is another reason why Home Depot has so many reservists and National Guardsmen on its staff: it thinks veterans make good employees.Finding enough quality people to hire is among the biggest challenges facing Home Depot, which, with a new store opened on average every 48 hours, claims to be America's fastest-growing retailer. The company filled more than 100,000 vacancies last year, about a third of them new positions. It knows that any decline in the standard of recruits would have a damaging impact on customer service.Mr Donovan says that the armed forces are one of the most plentiful and reliable sources of the skilled and disciplined workers Home Depot needs to run its stores and assist customers. More than a tenth of the company's 100,000 vacancies last year were filled by veterans, prompting GI Jobs, the magazine for military jobseekers, to name it America's most military-friendly employer.Home Depot is not the only company to have spotted the talent among the 200,000 people who leave the US military each year and the 1.2m more in the Reserves and National Guard. Sprint, Cisco, General Electric, Marriot and McDonald's are among other companies that run military recruitment programmes.""Much like campus and minority recruiting, nearly all big companies now have a military recruiting programme,"" says Rich McCormack, publisher of GI Jobs. ""They recognise that the military training veterans live every day is a huge asset. These are professional leaders that instantly add value to the companies that hire them.""Home Depot's programme, called Operation Career Front, is supported by the US Departments of Defence, Labour and Veterans' Affairs, which help the company contact departing servicemen through job centres and government websites.Much of Home Depot's efforts are focused on attracting Junior Military Officers - veterans typically in their late 20s, with several years of leadership experience in the forces. ""These are terrific people who tend to make the transition to civilian life well,"" says Mr Donovan. ""At a very young age, they've been leading a large group of people, making decisions and managing budgets. These are enviable and highly transferable skills.""Home Depot offers junior officers a place on its Store Leadership Programme, a two-year training scheme that ends with a management position in one of the company's nearly 2,000 stores across North America. Of the 900 people so far enrolled on the programme, more than 500 are former junior officers.One of them is John Pistone, a 34-year-old graduate of West Point, the elite US military academy, and now district manager for Home Depot in north-east Atlanta. He joined the Store Leadership Programme in 2002 after nine years in the 1st Cavalry Division, during which time he rose to the rank of platoon leader.""Army veterans tend to be results orientated,"" he says. ""They are good at execution and thinking strategically. They keep calm under pressure and think a couple of steps ahead.""Like all recruits to the leadership programme, Mr Pistone spent his first four months working on the store floor, stacking shelves and helping customers. ""It's hard to relate being holed-up on the Iraq-Kuwait border to working in the store - but the camaraderie is similar.""Next for Mr Pistone came a spell managing budgets in the accounts department. ""My background was in engineering - not business,"" he says. ""I could take apart and reassemble a 25mm gun, but I had no idea about selling things. So I enrolled on an MBA course and now I'm teaching finance to the recruits on the leadership programme.""For his final assignment, Mr Pistone was among a group sent into an underperforming store to help improve inventory management. ""It was a tougher task than I expected,"" he recalls. ""In the army, you can change something in two weeks just by using your rank. But in Home Depot, you've got to win over the associates and change the culture to effect change.""Frederico Juarbe, US assistant labour secretary for veterans' employment and training, praises Operation Career Front as a model for other companies. He says that it is important that skills acquired in the military do not go to waste once servicemen leave the forces.""It's about transferring to the private economy the $17bn that our nation spends every year on military training,"" he says. ""These are skilled individuals who can help drive economic growth and increase productivity.""Cynics may wonder whether Operation Career Front is partly designed to curry favour with the government. The programme is part of a warm relationship between Home Depot and the Bush administration. The company was among the biggest donors to Mr Bush's inauguration last month and Robert Nardelli, Home Depot's chief executive, serves on the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. In his first term, Mr Bush chose a Home Depot store as the venue for a speech about the economy.Mr Juarbe refutes the suggestion of cosiness with Home Depot, saying the government will work with any company that wants to recruit people leaving the armed forces. ""We would welcome Lowe's,"" he says, referring to Home Depot's fiercest rival.Reinforcing its support for the military, Home Depot has pledged $1m to carry out repairs and maintenance to the homes of soldiers serving overseas. ""While they are protecting our country, we are protecting their home front,"" says Mr Donovan.Home Depot's patriotism may play well in the US suburbs, but what happens in the other countries where the company operates: Canada, Mexico and, in the near future, China? Mr Donovan says his job is to find the best talent wherever Home Depot opens stores. ""The qualities we're looking for run across cultures,"" he says, raising the possibility that officers in the Chinese People's Liberation Army could soon be swapping their green tunics for the orange aprons of Home Depot."

Bush's lavish inauguration ceremony last week appears to be irking shareholders.As Observer reported, Bob Nardelli, the chief executive of the country's second-largest retailer, received a prime seat for his donation to the committee that funded Bush's second inauguration. Now F&C Asset Management, a shareholder in Home Depot, wants to know what it got the company.""We feel companies should put their donations to a shareholder vote; we believe they should seek some level of shareholder backing,"" Karina Litvack, head of governance and socially responsible investment at the London-based fund manager, tells Observer.""I have nothing to say about Mr Nardelli's personal donations. What caught my attention was Mr Nardelli using shareholder funds to fund what is clearly a political event.""The Atlanta-based retailer said yesterday that it ""has historically supported certain government and community affairs. Our support for the inauguration stems from our commitment to the democratic process . . . The company will respond directly to any stockholders' inquiries concerning this subject.""Litvack says Home Depot is not alone. The fund manager has also questioned the manner in which political donations were made by Citicorp, Morgan Stanley and others. Then again, the companies should not feel picked on: ""We take the same view toward charitable donations.""Free advertising?Here's a man bites dog story. JWT, an advertising agency unit of the UK's WPP, said yesterday it no longer would judge itself ""using financials as the sole performance measure"".Instead, the agency formerly known as J. Walter Thompson said it would use a new evaluation tool that would consider ""an office's work, people, client relationships and reputation, in addition to the bottom line"".The change comes as part of an effort by Bob Jeffrey, JWT chief executive, to transform his agency from what he calls ""a service-driven organisation that is ruled by the rational to a creative organism that is inspired by the visceral"". Observer wonders whether WPP's shareholders will be so relaxed about JWT's bottom line.Davos dudesDelegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos engaged in a rare exercise of self-examination yesterday. An electronic poll revealed that 66 per cent were men, 41 per cent in their 50s and 70 per cent from North America and Europe. ""We have some serious imbalances,"" said the moderator.The marginalisation of the developing world is glaring. But for the WEF the bigger problem is the shortage of delegates from Asia: only 15 per cent of the total, when Asia accounts for more than half the world's population and most of its most dynamic economies.So what's on the delegates' minds? Davos Man (two-thirds are men) apparently has a heart. Delegates ranked global poverty the number one priority, followed by equitable globalisation and climate change. Spreading education, fixing the Middle East and improving global governance came next.The global economy came in eighth: odd considering 50 per cent of the delegates are businessmen. Perhaps there is something in the Swiss mountain air.High lineNews of exciting new growth in Mexico City - another traffic jam. The city already had plenty of those, but the much-heralded opening of the second level of the city's ring road was supposed to help fix that. The problem was not enough signs, resulting in traffic build-ups.The confusion appears to confirm the view of critics that the project had been completed with undue haste to help the presidential ambitions of the city's mayor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. But there may be advantages. One is that the city has now moved on to a more promising pilot project for a ""metro-bus"" - which will operate in its own bus lanes in the main avenues. The other is the view for stationary motorists is much better from the second level, even with the smog.Last manAfghanistan's Jewish community has been dwindling for decades. Now it has been cut in half with the death of Ishaq Levin, the octogenarian caretaker of Kabul's only synagogue. His demise leaves Zebulon Simentov, a 45-year-old carpet seller, to inherit the title of Afghanistan's sole remaining Jew.One would expect Simentov to be distraught at the loss of Levin, with whom he shared the decrepit synagogue in central Kabul.On the contrary, Levin's demise seems to have come as a relief to Simentov, who smiled as he recounted Levin's death last week from diabetes. The men were arch enemies, who squabbled viciously over whom was responsible for the loss of the country's last Torah to rapacious Taliban officials. For years, they lived in stony silence at different ends of the shabby synagogue building in central Kabul, even refusing to celebrate Jewish festivals together.Simentov, who claims Levin tried to get him killed, told AP: ""Now I am the Jew here, I am the boss.""Chicken feedAn animal park in northeast China is attracting tourists in what can only be described as a live Discovery Channel experience.At the Siberia Tiger Park just outside of Harbin, tiger enthusiasts can pay Rmb40 ($4.80) to watch the hungry cats tear a live chicken to shreds in a matter of seconds. When Observer toured the grounds, a crew of visitors decided to purchase several chickens, which were strewn atop a dilapidated truck and pounced on by the tigers.If that doesn't sound exciting enough, you can pay Rmb1,500 ($181) to watch those hungry beasts devour an entire cow à la Jurassic Park.observer@ft.com"
522;HD;Home Depot;2005-01-16T18:27:05Z;Observer from Atlanta;;"Republicans win at musical chairsGeorgia's Republicans won control of the state legislature in November for the first time since 1870. After so long out of power, they had one thing clearly on their minds when the new session opened last week - securing the best offices.For 135 years they have been on the wrong end of office allocations, forced to work in cramped corners of the state legislature or even exiled to satellite buildings, while Democrats helped themselves to the biggest rooms. Last week was payback time.Cardboard boxes were strewn around the Capitol as Democrats were evicted and Republicans moved in. Cathy Cox, secretary of state, who is planning to challenge the Republican governor Sonny Perdue when he seeks re-election next year, was among those forced to seek new accommodation. Alan Powell, a veteran Democratic lawmaker, feared the upheaval would extend to the House floor, where he has sat for 12 years in the seat his grandfather occupied in the 1940s. ""It's sort of a family tradition,"" he said. ""But I know it's a new day in Georgia.""You're fired!Republican support is strongest in Atlanta's fast-expanding outer suburbs - the so-called ""exurbs"" where predominantly white middle-class families are moving. Four of the 10 fastest-growing counties in the US are on the fringes of Atlanta and all of them voted for George W. Bush.As the white middle classes move further out, the inner suburbs are becoming more ethnically diverse - and less reliably Republican. Take Clayton County in southern Atlanta: Non-white residents have grown from less than one-third of the population to 70 per cent in the past 15 years.The demographic change helped Victor Hill, a black Democrat, win election as county sheriff last year, a post never before held by an African- American. But instead of being hailed as a symbol of progress, Hill's victory has highlighted continued polarisation.On his first day in office earlier this month, Hill sparked an uproar by firing 26 senior staff, 19 of them white. Critics accused him of racism and a judge ruled the sackings unlawful. Hill was unrepentant: ""The only thing I've done is what sheriffs have done for years.""Naked truthAtlanta's most powerful and charismatic black politician is the mayor, Shirley Franklin. She has become the standard-bearer for liberal values in a city increasingly besieged by the social conservatism of the Bible Belt.Last month, for example, police raided a performance of Naked Boys Singing - a ""celebration of male nudity in song, dance and comedy"" - and charged its promoter with offering adult entertainment without a licence.But Franklin accepted an appeal by the show's producer, who argued it was artistic expression. The show has been running in New York for six years and probably would have attracted little attention in Atlanta but for the police action. Now, it is playing to packed houses three days a week, including ""ladies' night"" on Thursday.Green politicsFranklin's next target is a posh Atlanta golf club that refuses to grant family benefits to partners of two gay members. She has declared Druid Hills in violation of the city's anti-discrimination laws and imposed a $500-a-day fine until it falls into line.The club, which counts many of Atlanta's great and good as members, has vowed to defend its rules - and with annual membership fees of $50,000 it can afford to.As the birthplace of Martin Luther King, Atlanta has a proud history of fighting discrimination. But some liberals complain that Franklin could have found a worthier way to continue King's legacy than campaigning for wealthy gay golfers.Front-row BobAtlanta's stable of multinational companies, including Coca-Cola and United Parcel Service, mostly try to stay above politics. The exception is Home Depot, whose chief executive Robert Nardelli is among Bush's most vocal supporters in the business world.Attending a White House conference on the economy before Christmas, Nardelli told Bush he was ""tickled to death that your exodus was postponed for four years"". Home Depot is also one of the biggest corporate donors to Bush's inauguration ceremony this week - guaranteeing Nardelli a good seat.Slow laneHome Depot's support for the president fits the company's image as the shop of choice for do-it-yourself enthusiasts in lumberjack shirts. The favourite sport of this stereotypical redneck is Nascar, the stock-car racing series that boasts more fans than baseball. ""Nascar Dads"" - shorthand for working-class white southern men - were a key source of votes for Bush in the election.Not surprisingly, Home Depot sponsors one of the drivers, Tony Stewart. Unfortunately, Stewart - known as the bad boy of Nascar because of his frequent tantrums - finished last year five places behind Jimmie Johnson, sponsored by Home Depot's bitter rival, Lowe's."
523;HD;Home Depot;2005-01-14T00:31:50Z;Buoyant Home Depot signals overseas interest;;The head of Home Depot on Thursday signalled interest in making acquisitions in Europe and elsewhere, but said he was prepared to wait for the right opportunity.Home Depot is believed to have competed unsuccessfully last year in the auction of Wickes, the UK do-it-yourself chain, indicating that the world's largest home improvement retailer is keen to enter the European market.While declining to comment on specific companies or countries, Robert Nardelli, chairman and chief executive, said Home Depot was always open to acquisition opportunities but any deal would have to meet strict financial criteria.“We have ambitions to go places [outside the US] where we can realise returns on investment and where the business model and business management are compatible with our own,” he told reporters in Atlanta. “But I'm not going to buy top-line [growth].”His comments came as Home Depot said it had exceeded its earnings targets for 2004 but expected slightly slower growth this year.Analysts have speculated for years about a possible assault on the European market by Home Depot, with UK-based Kingfisher, the world's third-largest home improvement retailer, touted as a possible target. Kingfisher owns B&Q, UK market leader, and is in France, Italy, Poland and China.However, Mr Nardelli said an acquisition was not factored into Home Depot's 2005 projections and said the company's priorities were organic growth in the US, Mexico, Canada and China.Home Depot said it would spend $3.7bn this year opening 175 new stores taking the total to more than 2,000 and improving existing ones. Addressing a meeting of investors, Mr Nardelli said Home Depot occupied “the sweetest spot” in the retail industry as consumers increased spending on their homes.Mr Nardelli expected the broader US economy to be “good but not great” in 2005 as rising interest rates, a lack of new tax cuts and persistently high energy bills put a damper on growth.Carol Tome, chief financial officer, said the company expected to have increased sales by 12 per cent to $72.9bn and earnings per share by 20 per cent to $2.26 last year, exceeding previous guidance. Excluding new stores, sales growth was about 5 per cent. Ms Tome expected sales to grow 9-12 per cent this year, or 4-7 per cent excluding new stores. Earnings per share should increase by 10-14 per cent in 2005 to between $2.49 and $2.58.

The deal also offers the promise of strengthening Travis Perkins? existing business and delivering substantial savings, estimated at ?35m a year from 2006.Tim Stevenson, Travis Perkins chairman, said: ?We are delighted to announce the acquisition of Wickes and the addition of its talented team to the Travis Perkins Group. The adjacent DIY market offers highly-attractive long-term growth characteristics and the proposed acquisition enhances our offering in the merchant market.?Travis Perkins shares rose 9 per cent to a high of ?17.22 on confirmation of the deal.The purchase was funded by Travis Perkins? ?war-chest? of between ?800m and ?900m agreed with its banks, and a placing of 5m new ordinary shares to raise a further ?75m.The deal is dependent on gaining shareholders? approval at an extraordinary meeting in January and clearance by the Office of Fair Trading. But no problems are expected by the Travis Perkins? management.The enlarged Travis Perkins will have 10 per cent of the ?28.5bn DIY and builders? merchants market in the UK, compared with the 15 per cent of B&Q.Travis Perkins won the battle in the face of strong competition from Wolseley, the heating and plumbing supplier. GUS and Home Depot, the US DIY retailers, also mounted bids for Wickes. ?It was a pretty close-run thing at 10pm Wednesday it could have gone more than one way,? said one source.Wickes is the third largest DIY retailer in the UK, targeting small tradesmen and the serious DIY customer. It operates from 172 stores and generated sales of ?911m in the year to October 31.Wickes?s position at the ?heavy? end of the DIY market was the main cause of Travis Perkins? interest said chief executive Frank McKay. ?We have been looking at this for some time, but we have only been interested in Wickes. It has 80 per cent commonality of products with Travis Perkins and 35 per cent of their customers are the jobbing builder,? he said.The Wickes name and management will remain and Travis Perkins intends opening a further 28 Wickes stores in the next three years. Focus will continue to be run by private equity firms Apax and Duke St Capital, its largest shareholders, for the foreseeable future.Although a Goldman Sachs? review of the Focus-Wickes business included the option of selling off all assets, both companies committed themselves to further expansion of the business.
525;HD;Home Depot;2004-12-15T21:06:44Z;US east coast gears up for a big increase in cargo capacity;;"One of the most significant effects of this year's port congestion on the US west coast has been to encourage the shipping of cargo direct to less-congested east and gulf coast ports.The route, via the Panama Canal, takes cargo far closer by sea to most American consumers since 70 per cent of the population lives east of the Mississippi. Sea shipping is generally far cheaper than the overland transport necessary if goods for the east coast are landed on the west coast.However, traffic has particularly sought out ports such as Houston, Texas; Norfolk, Virginia, and Savannah in Georgia. This is because they have succeeded in attracting to their areas the regional distribution centres at which big US retailers sort their fast-growing volumes of Asian imports and send them on to shops.The most successful has been Savannah, which has attracted nearly every big US retailer to distribution centres only 10 minutes drive from its port since the first, Georgia-based Home Depot came 10 years ago.The Georgia Ports Authority says Asian traffic first became significant for the port in 2002 when a labour dispute closed all west coast ports for 10 days.Throughput has nearly doubled in five years to make Savannah the second-busiest container port on the east coast, behind only New York/New Jersey. The port's Asian traffic grew 31.5 per cent in the 2003 financial year, which covered the period of the dispute. There was another jump this year because of the west coast's congestion problems.Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, has said it intends eventually to bring a quarter of its US imports through Savannah and a quarter through Norfolk, which last year handled a 45.5 per cent jump in Asian imports.Yet east coast ports believe growth could have been even stronger if there had been enough suitable vessels available.The fact that routes from Asia to the east coast are 50 per cent longer than to the west coast means shippers need eight vessels for a weekly service to the east coast, compared with five for services to the west coast.A shortage of tonnage is compounded by the Panama Canal's size restrictions, which preclude the introduction of the biggest, most efficient ships on services between Asia and the west coast. As a result, extra vessels, particularly of the Panamax size, the biggest that can fit through the canal, are expensive and in short supply.However, shipyards are due to deliver big numbers of new, mostly large vessels next year and the world fleet capacity is set to grow by 14 per cent the year after. That should free up significant numbers of Panamax vessels and reduce prices. When that happens, east coast port officials believe, the region's already significant growth will accelerate further.“The move [of freight] from the west coast to the east coast hasn't really taken place yet because there are no available vessels,” says Robert Morris, external affairs director of the Georgia Ports Authority. “We're expecting a huge move in the next year to 18 months.”"
526;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Wall Street climbs on acquisition news;;"Wall Street forged ahead on Monday as investors pounced on stronger-than-expected US retail sales figures and a flurry of merger and acquisition activity reinforced speculation of further deals.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 0.9 per cent at 10,640.39, while the S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to 1,198.74.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite shot up 1 per cent to 2,148.31, buoyed by news that PeopleSoft had agreed to a multi-billion dollar takeover by Oracle, its business software rival.Bullish investors welcomed signs of renewed vigour in the stock markets following last week's widely expected retreat, which came in the face of uncertainties about world oil supply and a slow, but steady, stream of economic data that presented a mixed picture of the state of the US economy.PeopleSoft shares soared more than 10.3 per cent to $26.42 as Oracle's sweetened $26.50 per share offer brought to an end a bitter 18-month fight for control of the business software group.Oracle shares jumped 10.2 per cent to $14.63 as the company added to investor relief at the end of the takeover battle by reporting better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Siebel Systems, a business software rival, slipped 0.2 per cent to $9.97, while US-listed shares of SAP, the German business software group, rose 3.2 per cent to $45.05.PeopleSoft's $10.3bn price tag makes the acquisition one of several multi-billion dollar deals on Wall Street this month. It follows Johnson & Johnson's planned $24bn acquisition of Guidant, the cardiac stent maker, and the pending $35bn merger between Sprint and Nextel, the telecommunications groups. Talks are continuing on both deals, which were announced last week.Merger mania has taken hold across a wide range of sectors in recent days as companies mull whether to capitalise on this year's strong run on Wall Street to make acquisitions.John O'Donoghue, managing director of listed trading at Credit Suisse First Boston, said that although he was not expecting another big deal before the year-end the recent M&A activity was likely to continue into 2005.""Balance sheets in the US are in probably as good a shape cash-wise as they've been in many years,"" he said, adding that the stock market's strong performance had left many companies in a good position to use their shares as currency in M&A transactions.Honeywell, the diversified manufacturer, rose 3 per cent to $36.35 after its $798m offer for Novar, the UK electrical equipment group, was approved by the company's board. Shares in Toys R Us rose 2.9 per cent to $20.49 after the Financial Times reported that Apollo and Permira, the private equity groups, had teamed up to bid for the US toy group's retail operations.Conexant, the semiconductor company, rose 4.5 per cent to $1.87 in spite of warning that sagging demand and lower market prices would lead to a greater-than-expected first-quarter loss. One trader said that investors were weighing Monday's news against the potential for strong gains at the first sign of a turnround in the chip sector, which some analysts have said could happen early next year.Retailers ended mixed following an early rally sparked by official US data showing that retail sales grew by a stronger-than-expected 0.1 per cent in November. The report by the US Commerce Department also said that October retail sales had been higher than first estimated.Wal-Mart, the retail giant, rose 0.5 per cent to $52.95, but shares in rival Target were 0.4 per cent lower at $51.51. Home Depot, the home improvement group, was up 0.2 per cent at $42.73.Analysts had been disappointed by early reports indicating lacklustre retail sales in November, which included ""Black Friday"" - the day after Thanksgiving - traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year.Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, said the new data were a hopeful sign that retailers finally had the wind at their backs. ""Barring a major downward revision, we are set for a pretty robust holiday season.""Carmakers fell after motor vehicle and parts sales slipped 1.3 per cent in November, according to the government figures. General Motors slid 0.3 per cent to $38.80, while Ford dropped 0.1 per cent to $14.23."
527;HD;Home Depot;2004-11-23T18:59:31Z;The march of the Geek Squad;;"The Geek Squad, now patrolling nearly 700 Best Buy stores across the US and Canada, has good news for the technically challenged: ""We can fix any computer - any time - any place.""The computer-fixing technicians, who drive ""Geek Mobiles"" to their house calls, are Best Buy's 24-hour, seven-day-a-week, technical support and repair ""task force"". They charge a flat rate depending on the service and fix computers regardless of where they were bought.Dressed in short-sleeved white shirts with clip-on black ties and badges, the ""agents"" are dispatched to people's homes to do everything from removing viruses to installing wireless networks. But the Geek Squad is more than a posse of techies who take being a geek to extreme levels. It is also at the core of Best Buy's strategy to extend its dominance of the consumer electronics market into services.Many large retailers - including Home Depot, Costco, Staples and Petsmart - are turning to services to bolster their sales and earnings growth and gain a competitive edge against discounters, which compete mainly on price. Best Buy, the biggest US consumer electronics retailer, faces fierce competition from its rivals - notably Circuit City and Sears, Roebuck - as well as from warehouse clubs, Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, and Dell, the largest personal computer maker.""One way for a retailer to differentiate itself from the Wal-Marts of this world is to provide excellent services, which has never been a part of the Wal-Mart offering,"" says Darrell Rigby, head of the global retail practice at Bain & Company. ""The push to commoditisation by the discounters is destroying differentiation. (Offering services) is a good opportunity for retailers to differentiate from each other.""The move into services does not assure success, however. Mr Rigby says that most product companies struggle to make the service move pay off. ""They underestimate the capabilities that are required to provide good services,"" he says. ""There seems to be an assumption that people who know how to provide products will also be able to provide good service - the evidence is that this is just not true.""Moreover, the organisational structures established to provide services are often flawed. ""Either they give services too much independence and don't tie in with core products or they smother services with oversight by the products department who don't understand what is required to grow the services,"" says Mr Rigby.Even so, retailers that work to understand their customers' needs can be - and have been - successful. At Best Buy, which was struggling with very low rates of satisfaction with computer products, it became clear that future growth lay in providing solutions, not just products.""In many cases, we didn't have the solution to the kinds of problems people had when they used the products,"" says Brad Anderson, Best Buy's chief executive. ""At that point in time, we couldn't see a path to being able to provide - in a business with very little margin on the product - a solution. If there was ever a big single threat to the company, that was it. So we were looking for a solution to that dilemma.""As it happened, Robert Stephens, founder and chief inspector of the Geek Squad, was busy building his business in Minneapolis, Best Buy's home town.""Within the first six months of starting Geek Squad, I knew it was going to work because the demand was just so huge,"" he says. ""It was the basics: thank you for showing up on time, thank you for not talking down to me, thank you for not smelling bad.""One of his first customers was Best Buy, he says, which would hire them for technical support while filming television commercials for computers.Over the years, Best Buy's employees started defecting to the Geek Squad. Mr Stephens later told the company: ""Your customers are coming to us for services that they are willing to pay for and a lot of your employees are coming to work for us. They like Best Buy but they are seeking more of a challenge.""Best Buy struck on an idea: why not place highly trained Geek Squad ""agents"" in the stores and have them repair computers on site?Two years ago, it bought the Geek Squad - which was started in 1994 - after working behind the scenes with the company since 2000. The Geek Squad acquisition ties in well with the company's new ""customer centricity"" initiative, which involves identifying different customer segments, researching their lifestyles and their shopping needs and having well-trained employees focus on specific customers rather than just product categories. ""We're in this journey of moving from a product- centric to a customer- centric company,"" says Mr Anderson.Last month, Best Buy completed the roll-out of Geek Squad ""precincts"" to all of its 675 north American stores. While Mr Anderson does not speculate on how much the Geek Squad will add to the bottom line, he says the benefits are already filtering down. ""The core financial engines of the company haven't changed, but we have learned enough in terms of some of the work we have done here to begin to do enough small things better. That it is part of the reason that the income growth continues to be so robust,"" he says. ""We'll see more transformative change starting next year that will be significant to the financial engine of the company.""In this financial year, Best Buy's sales grew 17 per cent to $24.5bn (£13bn) while net income rose to $705m from $99m the year before, when the company recorded a loss for its Musicland division. In the 2002 financial year, the company earned $570m.Geek Squad agents are divided into three groups: there are 5,500 counter- intelligence agents who work behind the counters at ""precincts"" inside Best Buy stores; 820 double agents who mainly make house calls but also help out at the stores; and a handful of special agents who focus on small businesses with more complex networks that need help with their servers and firewalls. The Geek Squad also runs a dedicated, 24-hour call centre.This structure, says Mr Stephens, creates a career path for Best Buy employees. ""This is how we will attract and retain the best talent,"" he says. Having Best Buy's pool of nearly 100,000 employees to choose from is a big advantage, he says, because it gives the company access to a diverse workforce. ""The talent isn't just coming from the computer bench within the store, it's coming from (places such as) the media department and the appliances areas.""Mr Rigby says Best Buy's ability to attract, train and retain very high quality employees will be vital to their success. Geek Squad agents are selected based on their aptitude - their ability to solve problems they have never seen - and enthusiasm for technology. Training is divided into three areas: technical, clerical and behavioural.Mr Stephens says his contribution to the art of service is that one cannot make people care: either they do or they do not. The point is to pick the right people from the start. ""It is too inefficient and too risky spending money on training.""That said, he does believe in ""inspirational"" training. ""I try to give the agents a sense of purpose,"" he says. ""We're not curing cancer here and we're not ensuring world peace, but we are fixing the computers of the people who will."""
528;HD;Home Depot;2004-11-18T17:52:37Z;KMart and Sears move to allay staff fears;;"The top executives of Kmart and Sears, Roebuck on Thursday met staff at their companies' headquarters in the US Midwest to explain the rationale and consequences of their $11bn merger.The trio that will run the combined group Eddie Lampert, chairman of Kmart; Aylwin Lewis, chief executive of Kmart; and Alan Lacy, chief executive of Sears flew to Michigan on Wednesday night ahead of meetings on Thursday morning with Kmart staff.At Kmart's headquarters in Troy, they were due to address fears that job losses resulting from the deal might disproportionately hit staff there, according to people familiar with the matter.Sears Holdings, the name given to the new group, which will be the third-largest US retailer after Wal-Mart and Home Depot, will be headquartered in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, at Sears' current homebase.On Thursday afternoon, the trio of executives was expected to meet with Sears staff in Hoffman Estates, where they were due to address another set of issues.According to people close to the deal, Sears staff are worried about the structure of the transaction, which was technically a takeover by Kmart. Mr Lampert, the hedge fund manager who engineered the merger, was also expected to reassure Sears staff that the deal was not a giant “real estate liquidation play”.The companies said they would launch a review of stores to evaluate which ones could be divested for cash. The sale of non-performing assets was one of Kmart's key moves as it emerged successfully from bankruptcy last year half-owned by Mr Lampert.On Wednesday, Mr Lampert, Mr Lewis and Mr Lacy spent the day in New York, unveiling the deal to Wall Street analysts, investors, and the media.But their sense of urgency in returning to their homebases underlined in the eyes of many observers the importance of having the staff of both companies on their side as they embark on the merger integration."
529;HD;Home Depot;2004-11-17T18:34:57Z;Merger seeks to be more than its parts;;The merger of Kmart and Sears, Roebuck to create the third-largest US retailer has been greatly influenced by the industry’s dominant player Wal-Mart.The impact of the world’s biggest retailer, which leapfrogged both the discount operator and department store group in the late 1980s, continues to shape the retail landscape, forcing rivals to seek lower costs and ever-greater economies of scale.Eddie Lampert, chairman of Kmart, is confident of the combination, saying the merger is “extremely compelling” for its customers, associates and shareholders.“It will create a powerful leader in the retail industry, with greatly expanded points of distribution, leading proprietary home and apparel brands and significant opportunities for improved scale and operating efficiencies,” he says. “The merger will enable us to manage the businesses of Sears and Kmart to produce a higher return than either company could achieve on its own.”But does combining two weak companies create a powerful new force or simply one larger, weak company?“The combination of two followers doesn’t automatically create a leader,” says Darrell Rigby, head of the global retail practice at Bain & Company.He says there are potential cost synergies from the deal including economies of scale, a leaner supply chain and overhead savings but “they may not be sufficient to create a successful new company”.What is missing from the merger, says Mr Rigby, is sales growth. “They haven’t been able to solve the sales problems separately, so the question is: can they solve them jointly?”Investors appear to think so Sears’s shares rose 17.23 per cent to close at $52.99 in New York while Kmart’s shares gained 7.69 per cent to $109. Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, which produces an exclusive range of homewares for Kmart, rose 6.26 per cent to $18.49.Sears, which dates back to 1886, was once the world’s biggest retailer but has struggled to reinvent itself amid fierce competition from Home Depot and Lowe’s on tools and home products, Best Buy in appliances and Wal-Mart and Target on clothing and other products.Last year it sold its profitable credit card business to Citigroup to concentrate on retailing. But analysts warn that Sears has yet to devise a compelling strategy that will restart sales growthin its stores.Last month, Sears said third-quarter revenues fell 15 per cent to $8.3bn. Sales from stores open at least a year a key measure of retail health grew 1.9 per cent in October, reversing six months of negative sales growth.To boost growth, Sears has been pursuing a strategy of locating stores away from shopping malls. Earlier this year, it agreed to buy up 50 stores from Kmart.At the time, Alan Lacy, chairman and chief executive of Sears, said the deal would “jump-start our strategy to grow the Sears brand off-mall”.Sears said it planned to convert some of the newly acquired stores to its new Sears Grand concept, which offers grocery and convenience items as well as traditional Sears fare such as clothing, home appliances and tools.Mr Lacy is touting the merger as an opportunity to expand the off-mall strategy and “bring the right brand to the right place”.“We think this is a fabulous merger,” he says. “It is a great combination of two very fine companies and brands.”Aylwin Lewis, Kmart’s recently appointed chief executive, says the merger will “allow us to turbocharge our business”.On Wednesday, Kmart said it made a third-quarter profit of $553m, or $5.45 a share- its fourth straight profit after 11 consecutive quarters of losses. But total sales fell 13.7 per cent to $4.4bn, and same-store sales decreased 12.8 per cent.Like Sears, Kmart also achieved the ranking of world’s biggest retailer albeit briefly.It was opened in 1962 the same year a small-town entrepreneur named Sam Walton in Arkansas opened Wal-Mart by a decades-old five-and-dime chain. These two discount store formats changed the face of retailing they were big edge-of-town superstores selling a huge range of goods at low prices.By 1989, Kmart had beaten its rival Sears to take the number-one global retailing spot. One year later, Wal-Mart overtook them both.In the interim, Kmart and Sears have struggled to compete with stronger rivals such as Wal-Mart and Target. In January 2002, Kmart filed for bankruptcy the biggest US retailer to do so.When a slimmed-down Kmart emerged from bankruptcy protection in May last year, few thought that 18 months later it would be buying one of the most venerable names in US retailing and attempting to tackle Wal-Mart once more.But Dan Hess, chief executive of Merchant Forecast, a research firm, cautions that while the merger makes sense because of cost savings and the fact that Sears will be able to extend rapidly its off-mall strategy, it is not the answer to either company’s troubles.“There are fundamental problems in both business models,” he says. “One can’t make the assumption that adding some of Sears’s proprietary brands to Kmart is all it needs to gain market share from Target and Wal-Mart, and Sears adding off-mall locations through Kmart stores is all it will take for it to gain market share back from Home Depot and Lowe’s.”Much depends on execution. As Mr Rigby says: “No one - not the shareholders, the customers or the employees - will look back on this merger with indifference. In five years it will become a textbook case for a brilliant or a bewildering merger strategy.”
530;HD;Home Depot;2004-11-16T21:39:07Z;Inflation fears weigh on Wall Street stocks;;"Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday as higher-than-expected producer price inflation data combined with some mixed-to-disappointing quarterly results from leading retailers, which were sold off because of expectations of a market pullback.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.6 per cent at 10,488.24, while the broader S&P 500 index shed 0.7 lower at 1,175.49. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.7 per cent to 2,078.62.Tom McManus, the investment strategist at Banc of America Securities, described the recent rally in the S&P 500 as a ""round trip"" to the levels the index was at three years ago, but questioned whether it implied that the outlook for US stocks had improved.The government said producer prices rose by 1.7 per cent last month, the highest pace in 15 years because of rising fuel costs. Even the core inflation gauge that excludes volatile food and energy expenditure exceeded forecasts.Anthony Chan, managing director and senior economist at JP Morgan Fleming noted that the rise might not necessarily translate in a corresponding advance for consumer prices amid a continued climate of pricing power for US corporations.""This was a wake-up call to the markets that profit margins will shrink,"" Mr Chan said.The rise in the inflation reading also increases concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again next month. Combined with possible upward pressure on interest rates from a declining dollar, mounting inflation is acknowledged by many as a threat to the outlook for stocks.Several big retailers reported strong results but their shares declined amid concerns about the pace of sales growth with the Christmas shopping season starting next week. US consumers' spending appetite has been widely credited for the economy's rebound, however slow that has appeared at times. The sell-off in retailer shares came amid expectations for a broader retreat in stock prices after a three-week rally.Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, reported an expected rise in profits of 13 per cent and increased its full-year forecast. Shares edged off 1.4 per cent to $56.89 as investors appeared unimpressed by the retailer's weak sales growth and its chief executive's upbeat projection for the holiday shopping season.Also among Dow industrial stocks, Home Depot's shares gave up 1.8 per cent to $43 as the US' biggest home improvement goods and services retailer increased its full-year earnings forecast after reporting a profit increase above expectations of 15 per cent.Wal-Mart and Home Depot paced a broad sell-off for the sector as the retail index gave up 1.7 per cent by the close. Other notable retail stocks to fall were May Department Stores, down 2.4 per cent to $28.52, and Sears Roebuck, down 2.4 per cent to $45.20.The downward trend for retailers was evident as JC Penney shares dipped 1.1 per cent to $39.98 even after it exceeded analysts' expectations for the quarter.Saks further disappointed investors with an unexpected quarterly loss it attributed to hurricanes in the south-eastern US. Shares lost 5.9 per cent to $13.Staples, the office products retailer, saw shares give up 1 per cent to $30.87 after it reported a 26 per cent rise in quarterly profits, forecasting earnings in line with expectations for the fourth quarter. The company said strong sales in the back-to-school season and in Europe contributed to its results.Shares in Office Depot, Staples' main rival, lost 2.8 per cent to $16.68.Away from retailers, shares in Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage financing company, gave up 1.1 per cent to $69.40. Fannie delayed its quarterly results and warned that accounting problems could lead it to report a $9bn loss.Google's stock shed 6.7 per cent to $172.54 as 38.5m shares held mostly by the internet search provider's staff became available for sale, following the end of a ""lock-up"" period after the initial public offering.General Motors put further pressure on the Dow industrials, down 1.5 per cent to $39.65 after the Wall Street Journal reported the carmaker was backing away from its pledge to achieve earnings per share of $10 in the next two years.Also lower were the shares of Charter Communications, a cable company that announced plans to raise $750m in convertible bonds that are seen as diluting future shareholder value. Shares lost 20 per cent to $2.16.In merger and acquisition news, Community Banks agreed to take over PennRock Financial Services for $326m. Community shares fell 10.1 per cent to $28.28 while PennRock gained 30.1 per cent to $38.71."
531;HD;Home Depot;2004-11-15T21:35:33Z;Wall St starts week cautiously despite oil decline;;US stocks began the week cautiously as a falling crude oil price was countered by heightened worries the market was overextended after three consecutive weeks of gains.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent up at 10,550.24 while the broader S&P 500 index was flat at 1,183.83. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.2 per cent at 2,094.09.Stocks faced resistance even as crude oil futures declined to below $47 per barrel amid continued expectations of rising reserves.The S&P 500 and the Dow have tacked on three consecutive weeks of gains and stood at three-year and seven month highs, respectively, by Friday's close. But some analysts warn that the gains are disproportionate in the face of the uncertainties remaining in the US economy. While bulls are seen as still in charge, slowly dwindling trading volumes suggest the current rally may run out of steam before Christmas. On Monday about 1.5bn shares traded at the New York Stock Exchange, but traders said they would like to see volume closer to the 1.8bn shares that traded at the onset of the current rally.David Rosenberg, chief North America economist at Merrill Lynch, dismissed any pessimism about the outlook for stocks and gave no less than 10 reasons to be bullish. They include the interest rate and bond market outlook, declining oil prices and the economy, as well as the upcoming holiday shopping season and the declining dollar.He did acknowledge the dollar could become a threat if its decline warranted increases in interest rates that would in turn choke the rebound of the economy.Shares in Microsoft reversed a steep decline in pre-market trading and rose 1.9 per cent to $27.39 by the close on the day the world's biggest software company was distributing a much-heralded $30bn dividend.Microsoft shares did not see the typical decline associated with stocks going ex-dividend and confounded expectations that such a retreat could weigh on the broader technology sector. However, the see-sawing trade on Monday failed to vindicate the view of other market participants who had predicted a broad rally after investors would reinvest the $30bn back in the stock market.Among companies due to report earnings this week, Lowe's said it achieved a 15 per cent rise in third-quarter profits. Shares in the second-biggest home improvement retailer in the US edged off 1.7 per cent to $59.25.Home Depot, a rival, saw shares add 1.3 per cent to $43.79 in afternoon exchanges. It reports earnings on Tuesday. The two retailers are also seen as indicators of the strength of the housing market because they provide a wide range of home improvement goods and services that respond to housing market trends.Also among retailers, Family Dollar shares rose 2.8 per cent to $32.14 while Staples shares added 2.3 per cent to $31.10 after Barron's, the weekly investment newspaper, gave an upbeat review of the two stocks.In the online retail sector, the shares of Overstock.com lost 4.8 per cent to $57.30 after the company announced the sale of 1m shares to finance its capital expenditure needs. Such transactions are seen as dilutive of the value of existing stock.Northeast Utilities sounded a cautious note as it cut its earnings forecast for next year, citing difficulty in securing some wholesale contracts. Its shares lost 10 per cent to $18.01.In merger-and-acquisition news, the shares of SPX rose 2.8 per cent to $44.21 on reports it is close to concluding a deal with General Electric to sell its fire and security unit to the conglomerate. GE shares lost 0.4 per cent to $36.10.WM Wrigley, which makes chewing gum, was reported to be close to buying the Life Savers and Altoids brands from Kraft Foods, whose shares eased 0.6 per cent to $34.68. Wrigley's shares inched up 1.1 per cent to $68.08.In the media sector, shares in Marketwatch rose 7.9 per cent to $18.02 after news that the financial news group would be taken over by Dow Jones. The latter's shares edged off 0.2 per cent to $45.10.Among pharmaceuticals, Perrigo shares lost 1.6 per cent to $18.36 after the maker of generic drugs agreed to buy an Israeli company for $818m.Tyson Foods saw shares rise 1.2 per cent to $17.08 even after the meat processing company reported a decline in quarterly earnings. The results exceeded analyst forecasts.
532;HD;Home Depot;2004-08-24T06:22:59Z;FedEx raises full-year earnings target;;Federal Express delivered fresh evidence of growth in international trade and the resilience of the US recovery on Monday as it upgraded profit forecasts for the second time in two months.Bucking recent economic pessimism, the distribution company is handling higher-than-expected volumes of packages thanks mainly to China?s spreading impact on global supply chains and rising demand for home deliveries in the US.FedEx?s upbeat message contrasted with disappointing weekly sales data from Wal-Mart, the world?s largest retailer, which warned hurricanes in Florida could help wipe out any growth for the month of August.US retailers have provided mixed signals about consumer confidence, with weakening sales in June and July followed by upbeat outlooks for the year from Wal-Mart, Lowe?s, Target and Home Depot.While retailers worry about the sustainability of spending growth, FedEx sees strong demand for its ground delivery services, driven by the growing acceptance of online shopping as an alternative. Comscore, an independent market researcher, estimates online retail sales in the US are now climbing at 22 per cent a year.FedEx also believes the impact of China?s economic boom is spreading beyond Asia, causing increasing demand for express cargo deliveries in both Europe and the US.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said: ?While there are potential risks on the horizon, such as prolonged high oil costs that could impact the worldwide economy, we believe we will continue to see strong demand which will result in higher earnings.?With its 5.5m daily shipments and a pivotal role in international trade, FedEx - and other express carriers - can be a useful bellwether for economic trends, particularly as fresh volume data is analysed from its distribution hubs each night. United Parcel Service also reported strong growth from US ground deliveries in its most recent quarterly earnings statement.Mr Graf pointed to growth in FedEx?s international express, ground and less-than-truckload businesses as the main reason for lifting group profits forecasts for 2005 from between $4.20 and $4.40 per share to a range of $4.40 to $4.60. FedEx last raised its profit forecasts in June after announcing stronger-than-expected results for its fourth quarter.It also now expects to increase capital spending for the year ending May 2005 from about $1.6bn to between $2bn and $2.1bn. This month, the company invested $120m in the acquisition of a parcel consolidator, to take advantage of growth in online retailing.
533;HD;Home Depot;2004-08-17T20:54:01Z;Global Overview: Fluctuating oil price sets agenda;;European and Asian markets on Tuesday made the most of an early respite for oil prices although gains on Wall Street were muted after crude futures climbed to a new peak in US trade.Nymex crude futures ended 70 cents higher at $46.75 per barrel after setting a new lifetime high of $46.95 as traders readied themselves for today's weekly inventory data in the US. In London, October Brent gained 30 cents at $42.99.Strong earnings from Home Depot and economic reports showing US inflation was in check and housing starts rebounded in July contributed to a strong open on Wall Street although gains faded as the oil price picked up once more.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.2 per cent higher while the Nasdaq Composite put on 0.7 per cent.Analysts were split over the significance of the two-day rally. Some argued that markets had become seriously oversold and that worries about the impact of higher oil prices were overdone. Others, however, had a more cautious approach.Anais Faraj at Nomura International said Wall Street's bounce looked to be a simple technical respite and offered little comfort for the weeks ahead.“Some observers attribute the rebound to softer oil prices but a dip to ‘only' $45 a barrel hardly counts as a meaningful correction,” he said. “Moreover, while the Venezuelan elections have delivered an overwhelming victory to [President Hugo] Chavez, the opposition has yet to gracefully accept the outcome. For equity markets, a cautious stance is warranted until September.”Europe pushed higher, led by rebounds in the technology and insurance sectors. Tech shares had been under pressure in recent sessions after gloomy forecasts from a number of key players, while insurers were hit on Monday by worries over possible payouts in the wake of hurricane Charley in Florida. The FTSE Eurotop 300 index rose 0.1 per cent to 951.41.Asia was broadly higher and Tokyo picked up from Monday's three-month low. However, the Nikkei 225 Average managed a rise of only 0.4 per cent as the market remained concerned about the impact of highoil prices on corporate profits.
534;HD;Home Depot;2004-08-17T12:58:27Z;Oil climb curbs rally on Wall Street;;Easing inflation and upbeat results from Home Depot and other retailers helped Wall Street extend its rally slightly on Tuesday, but early gains fizzled as high oil prices sapped enthusiasm.By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained just 0.2 per cent to 9,972.83, down from highs above 10,000 in morning trade. The S&P 500 traded 0.2 per cent higher to 1,081.71, while the Nasdaq rose 0.7 per cent to 1,795.25.Volume was light, with 1.2bn shares changing hands at the New York Stock Exchange.Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, said the market's inability to hold robust morning gains into afternoon trade fitted the pattern that has dogged the market for most of the year. “This [lacklustre afternoon trade] is important because you want to see additional buying coming into the market,” he said, adding: “The low volume says the market is pretty much at status quo, which has been for a slow downtrend over the last six months or so.”Nonetheless, the day's economic data worked in investors' favour, with consumer prices dropping by 0.1 per cent in July, the first decline since November 2003, and the core inflation rate edging up 0.1 per cent, below expectations. The figures lent weight to the view that the Federal Reserve would not have to act quickly to raise interest rates.Good news from the retail sector sparked the charge, giving investors hope that the consumer may yet keep spending. The S&P 500 group rose 1.4 per cent, one of the session's best showings. Home Depot, the largest retailer of home improvement products, climbed 3.3 per cent to $35.10 after topping Wall Street's expectations with a 19 per cent jump in quarterly profits. The chain also boosted its forecast for full year earnings growth to 17 per cent from a previous estimate of 14 per cent.Rival Lowe's, which reported its own rising profits on Monday, climbed 1.1 per cent to $49.69.Staples, the biggest US office supplies chain, rose 3.6 per cent to $28.87 after raising forecasts for full year growth. The company also unveiled a 39 per cent increase in second quarter earnings on a 9 per cent climb in revenues.JC Penney, the department store chain, gave up early gains to slide 0.7 per cent to $38.48, in spite of swinging to a second quarter profit thanks to stronger sales.Dick's Sporting Goods climbed 13.6 per cent to $32 after turning in second quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates and raising its full year earnings forecast.Another retailer was boosted for a different reason. Pier 1 Imports climbed 8.7 per cent to $17.56 on news that Warren Buffet's investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, owns 8m shares of the home furnishings company. The position was reported in the latest regulatory filing, and is new to the Sage of Omaha.Motorola, the world's second biggest mobile phone maker, added to the market cheer when it said it expected sales growth to remain robust in the second half. Investors sent shares 4.6 per cent higher to $15.08.Things were not so bright elsewhere in the telephone equipment industry. Nortel Networks shed 0.9 per cent to $3.39 after the company announced that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had begun a criminal investigation of its accounting.Tyson Foods also had trouble with regulators, announcing that the Securities and Exchange Commission planned to recommend a civil action against the company for failing to disclose fully about $1.7m in payments to Don Tyson, the company's former senior chairman and largest shareholder. Shares shed 1 per cent to $18.51.Halliburton shares dipped 1.8 per cent to $27.30 on news that the US army could withhold 15 per cent of its future payments for its supply and support contracts for troops in Iraq.One of the day's biggest winners was Metron Technology, which leapt 98.2 per cent to $4.36 after Applied Materials said it would buy the Dutch company for $85m. Applied Materials shares rose 2.8 per cent to $16.07. The climb came ahead of earnings results from the chip equipment supplier, due after the closing bell.Calpine, the independent power producer, climbed 3.4 per cent to $3.38 after agreeing to sell its natural gas reserves in Canada to PrimeWest Energy Trust for about $625m.
535;HD;Home Depot;2004-08-16T14:54:20Z;Wall Street climbs as oil price eases;;US stocks rallied sharply on Monday as US investors expressed relief that oil prices eased off of another record high, but many analysts doubted that the bounceback would last.Strategists said the rally was also partly a bounceback from an oversold condition, as stocks skidded to 12-month lows late last week.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 1.3 per cent to 9,954.55, while the S&P 500 rose 1.4 per cent to 1,079.34. The Nasdaq climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,782.84.However, many analysts were sceptical the rally would last. Stuart Schweitzer, global market strategist at JP Morgan Fleming Asset Management, said investors still had plenty of reason to be cautious, but added that the strong showing was all the more impressive after an extremely weak report on manufacturing activity in the New York region.Nonetheless, upbeat news from a handful of retailers drove a broadly based rally, and sent the sector to the S&P 500's best showing, up 2.8 per cent.Lowe's rose 5.3 per cent to $49.14 after the home improvement chain posted higher earnings, and said August sales were better than expected. Investors overlooked the fact that the company missed analysts' forecasts as the company guided earnings estimates in the current quarter slightly higher than Wall Street's consensus. It was among the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500.Rival Home Depot, due to unveil earnings on Tuesday, rose 2.5 per cent to $33.98.Elsewhere in retail, Kmart Holding, the operator of the discount chain, rose 17.2 per cent to $76.05, after the company swung to a second-quarter profit, thanks to lower costs and promotions.Kohl's climbed 2.3 per cent to $47.17, after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “in-line.”Insurers rallied as investors expressed relief that the latest estimates for the cost of damage caused by Hurricane Charley in Florida at the weekend between $5bn and 10bn are lower than previously feared.Further, investors hoped the disaster would help stabilise the slide in rates for property insurance. The S&P 500 sector rose 1.8 per cent.Allstate, the home and auto insurer rose 1.4 per cent to $46.55, in spite of warning the potential losses from the disaster could hit its current quarter results. AIG, the world's biggest insurer, climbed 2.4 per cent to $68.05. Renaissance Re, the reinsurer, rose 1.9 per cent to $51.83. St Paul Travelers added 1.9 per cent to $33.58.Mike Holton, portfolio manager of the T Rowe Price Financial Services Fund, said that $5bn-$10bn amounts to just 2-3 per cent of the industry's capital. “The industry can absorb that kind of blow and not skip a beat,” adding “In an industry plagued by over-capitalisation, any time you take capacity out it's a positive.”Toy companies were also in focus, after last week's restructuring announced by Toys R Us. Mattel shed 1.3 per cent to $16.96, after it was downgraded by both Lehman Brothers and Smith Barney. It was among the session's worst performers on the S&P 500. Hasbro dipped 0.2 per cent to $17.60, after it was also cut by Lehman, down to underweight from equal weight.Continuing the recent spate of M&A activity, LifePoint Hospitals said it would buy Province Healthcare for $1.7bn. Markets voiced their displeasure with the deal's 66 per cent premium for Province, sending LifePoint shares down 15.4 to $27.70. Province soared 41.4 per cent to $19.25, the best showing on the New York Stock Exchange.Sysco, the food distributor, dropped 7.3 per cent to $31, in spite of posting rising earnings, as investors worried about margin-pinching inflation and softening sales. The company said it saw slower sales in its fourth fiscal quarter, which have continued into the current quarter.One of the session's top movers was Ciphergen Biosystems, which climbed 21.4 per cent to $3.29, after the company announced promising results from a study in the detection of early stage ovarian cancer.
536;HD;Home Depot;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
