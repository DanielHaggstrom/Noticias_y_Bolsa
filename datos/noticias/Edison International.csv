0;EIX;Edison International;2019-12-23T04:00:28Z;Fire and flood focus minds of bosses and investors;Quantifying the weather-related costs from climate change is still a difficult job;"For Southern California Edison, a US power company with 15m customers, the risks of climate change are already in its backyard.Edison’s electrical wires sparked two deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018, and the company recently set aside a $4.7bn reserve fund for possible liabilities related to the fires. Now it has embarked on a costly programme to upgrade its electrical lines and make its grid less likely to spark fires. “We are seeing the early manifestations of climate change in our state,” said chief executive Pedro Pizarro. “Beginning in 2017 and with the fires in northern California, those were at a scale that no one had ever imagined.” He outlines what Edison is doing in response. The company is replacing 6,000 miles of bare electrical wire to reduce fire risk, installing thousands of micro weather stations that monitor wind speeds, and swapping out the oil in its transformers with a less flammable alternative. For Edison International, the listed company that owns Southern California Edison, the financial impact of the fires has been serious. The company reached a $360m settlement agreement with the public entities that were damaged by the Thomas and Woolsey fires, and multiple other legal cases will determine damages to other parties. For another California utility, PG&E, the impact has been even worse. PG&E started bankruptcy proceedings in January 2019 after a series of catastrophic wildfires left it on the hook for as much as $30bn in possible liabilities. Owing to the severe risk, PG&E had to shut off power to nearly 3m customers this autumn, to prevent its electrical wires from sparking another fire. Edison also used blackouts in areas of high risk, leaving about 200,000 customers without power.The California wildfires and their impact on power companies are one of the most visible examples of how climate-related risks are starting to affect businesses, sometimes at a speed and scale that is unexpected. Over the past year, a growing number of companies and investors have been focusing on the physical risks of climate change, which include not just wildfires but also changing weather patterns, storms, and increased flood risks. Paul Polman, the former chief executive of Unilever said there had been a big shift in the way companies viewed climate-related risks. He pointed to a recent survey that asked board members whether climate change was relevant to their business: In 2017, 40 per cent of respondents said it was not relevant, but in 2018 that figure dropped to 14 per cent. “You see things moving faster than anyone ever imagined,” he said, referring to how businesses consider climate risk. “Companies need to have climate-competent boards.” The physical risks are only part of the picture — businesses also face risks from abrupt policy shifts, as governments try to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Over the past year, several major economies including the UK and France have adopted targets to cut emissions to net zero by 2050, which will mean a radical restructuring of the economy in coming decades. As companies try to plan for these changes and quantify their impact, regulators have also taken note. Earlier this month, the Bank of England outlined a climate stress test for the largest UK banks and insurers, saying it would be the toughest such test in the world. The test will scrutinise how institutions are prepared for more frequent severe weather events, and examine whether they could withstand a sudden fire sale of “brown” assets (those considered detrimental to the environment).“Climate change will affect the value of virtually every financial asset; the [test] will help ensure the core of our financial system is resilient to those changes,” said Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.The test includes three future scenarios, the most severe of which envisages 4C of warming by the year 2080, which would bring major weather changes including heatwaves and flash floods. Jon Williams, partner for sustainability and climate change at PwC, said companies and institutions needed to carry out their own checks, even before the mandatory tests begin. “Firms need to think about how their businesses, operations and clients are exposed to physical, transition and liability-related risks,” he said. However, quantifying the exact costs of the changing weather that results from climate change is still a difficult undertaking. Some sectors, such as real estate, have developed sophisticated risk assessment models that take rising sea levels and storm risks into account. But for many sectors, the effects of climate change are more diffuse.A study by the non-profit climate assessment group CDP, which tallied the climate risks reported by 500 of the world’s largest companies, found that they reported nearly $1tn in climate risks to their business. Of these, around $250bn were related to write-offs or impairments due to policy changes and physical risk. For the California power companies, the wildfires are only one example of the physical risks that companies face due to climate change. “It is not just drought, but we have also had floods,” said Mr Pizarro, adding that abnormally high winds have also helped to stoke the fires. “Climate change brings significant volatility and changing patterns.”While some parts of the world will see more frequent heatwaves and drought due to global warming, others could see increased rain and flooding. The power companies also have to plan for how to address rising sea levels and the challenge of coastal erosion. One thing under consideration is “to what extent will we need to harden our grid there in response to sea level rise,” said Mr Pizarro. “Will you see adaptation as moving inland from the coast, or will the homes on the coast be [protected]?” Moral Money is our new weekly newsletter covering sustainable business, finance and investing. Sign up here for breaking news and insightful analysis on this bubbling revolution.The uncertain physical risks are compounded by big policy shifts under way. California aims to be carbon neutral by 2045, which will mean a complete reshaping of the utilities business.Electricity demand is expected to rise by 60 per cent by 2045 compared with today, according to calculations by Edison, as the state works to cut emissions by introducing more electric vehicles. At the same time, California will also boost its wind and solar power, and add more energy storage. “The investment requirement across the economy for added renewable storage and wires is around $250bn between now and 2045,” said Mr Pizarro. That figure does not include the new electric vehicles or home heaters that will also be needed to reach the target.The year capitalism went cuddlyGerman bosses question US pledges on corporate reformHow asset managers turned into business agitatorsFacebook joins Silicon Valley’s rush to appear responsibleWhat it feels like to be a worker in the ‘woke’ worldWarren Buffett on why companies cannot be moral arbiters"
1;EIX;Edison International;2018-11-12T17:40:56Z;Californian power companies under scrutiny as wildfires spread;Electrical equipment among possible causes of blazes that have killed at least 31;Shares in California utilities PG&E and Edison International plunged on Monday as concerns rose that deadly wildfires ravaging the state could cost them billions of dollars.PG&E and Edison, which serve territories affected by separate wildfires in northern and southern California, could face liabilities from fires potentially ignited by electrical equipment as well as the cost of damage to their infrastructure, analysts said.PG&E shares fell as much as 38 per cent, prompting a brief halt in trading, before closing 17.4 per cent lower at $32.98. Edison shares retreated as much as 25 per cent before paring their losses to finish down 12.2 per cent at $53.56.At their lows, PG&E and Edison shares posted their worst intraday performance since California was hit by power shortages about 16 years ago.Firefighters have been battling multiple blazes in northern and southern California. The Camp fire — as the outbreak in northern California is called — has grown to become the most destructive in the state’s history, burning 109,000 acres and more than 6,000 homes as of Sunday.Officials said the fire had killed 29 people, while two others had died in a separate blaze near Los Angeles. More than 200 people are missing. An early estimate from Morgan Stanley put insured losses from the Camp fire at $2bn to $4bn, with higher economic costs.The cause of the Camp fire is under investigation. Cal Fire, the state’s firefighting agency, is reportedly looking into whether electrical equipment could have ignited the blaze.In a filing with the state’s utilities regulator last week, PG&E said it detected damage to a transmission tower in the area where the Camp fire started, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The company said the information it provided was preliminary.Greg Gordon, Evercore ISI analyst, cut his price target for PG&E shares to $49 from $55, citing an “exposure place holder” of $3.5bn, according to Bloomberg. Investors were discounting more than $20bn in exposure, Mr Gordon said.Michael Lapides, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said he expected “incremental investor concern” as the wildfires spread. He also noted that a California law passed in August did not contain provisions that would allow utility companies to recover costs related to potential fires this year.The California Fire Fighters, FEMA and First Responders are amazing and very brave. Thank you and God Bless you all!Edison’s local subsidiary, Southern California Edison, submitted an initial safety incident report that noted an outage in the vicinity of the Woolsey fire, which has forced thousands of Los Angeles-area residents to evacuate. The fires have damaged Southern California Edison equipment and lines, according to the company.Both PG&E and Edison said they would co-operate fully with any investigations.PG&E took a $2.5bn charge in the second quarter to cover its potential liabilities from a series of wildfires last year. In June, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection linked PG&E-owned power poles and lines to 12 fires that hit northern California in October 2017.More than 8,000 firefighters were battling the blazes on Monday, while winds fanned flames feeding on dry brush. President Donald Trump tweeted: “The California Fire Fighters, FEMA and First Responders are amazing and very brave. Thank you and God Bless you all!”Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said it was still too early to make credible estimates of the financial losses, but that primary insurers rather than reinsurers would likely bear the majority of the cost to the insurance industry. According to RMS, a modelling firm, 6,700 structures have already been destroyed by the Camp fire, and over 15,000 more are threatened.In a blog on the RMS website Chris Folkman, a senior director at the company, wrote: “The wide dispersion of smoke was a noticeable feature of the fires in many highly populated areas of California. The smoke is sure to result in many insurance claims for evacuation, business interruption, and contents damage.”The share prices of insurance companies fell on Monday. According to KBW, the five largest insurers in California by market share are State Farm, Farmers, Liberty Mutual, Allstate and Auto Club Exchange.Many of those are mutuals or privately owned. But shares in Allstate fell 2.3 per cent on Monday, while Travelers, Chubb and AIG were all off more than 3 per cent.KBW said AIG and Chubb could have significant exposure to properties in Malibu, which is in the path of the Woolsey Fire in southern California.
2;EIX;Edison International;2017-12-21T20:11:35Z;Utilities short-circuited by California wildfires;;A devastating rash of wildfires that have hit California over the past few months are casting a long shadow over two of the state’s major utility groups, PG&E and Edison International.PG&E shares are down nearly 12 per cent on Thursday, a day after the company announced that it was suspending its dividend, citing “uncertainty related to causes and potential liabilities associated with the extraordinary October 2017 Northern California wildfires.” If held, the drop will be the company’s biggest since August 2002, according to Thomson Reuters data.It’s PG&E’s second major tumble in recent months. Just after the wildfires broke out, it shares were hit as concerns grew about its possible liability for the wildfires. Those concerns were underscored by Wednesday’s announcement, in which PG&E acknowledged that no cause had yet been identified for the October blaze.That leaves a cloud of uncertainty hanging over PG&E. The company — which is headquartered in San Francisco and operates Pacific Gas & Energy, billed as California’s largest investor-owned utility — said that California courts have found that utilities could be liable for property damage caused by their equipment — meaning that if PG&E equipment is found to be a culprit for the fire, it could be forced to pay up.Given the extensive damage, the tab for the wildfires could run into the millions or even billions of dollars.“After extensive consideration and in light of the uncertainty associated with the causes and potential liabilities associated with these wildfires as well as state policy uncertainties, the PG&E boards determined that suspending the common and preferred stock dividends is prudent with respect to cash conservation and is in the best long-term interests of the companies, our customers and our shareholders”, said Richard Kelly, chair of PG&E’s board.Those concerns have also infected Edison International, another utility group with a large California presence through its subsidiary Southern California Edison. Edison’s shares are down 6.7 per cent on Thursday after PG&E’s announcement.Edison recently set off alarms on Wall Street when it said that it believed investigators looking into the cause of another deadly wildfire outbreak in the southern part of the state could be looking at “the possible role of its facilities.” Including Thursday’s drop, Edison’s has lost nearly 22 per cent of its share price value so far this month.The losses have dragged the utilities sector on the S&P 500, which is one of the few sectors in the red on Thursday despite a tax reform-fuelled rally. It shed 0.9 per cent today, and 6.5 per cent so far in December, putting it on track for its worst one-month loss since February 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data.
3;EIX;Edison International;2017-12-12T16:51:42Z;Edison leads utilities lower while California wildfires burn;;Edison International shares have been singed amid an investigation into the cause of wildfires raging in California, and its losses have helped to drag the utilities sector to the bottom of the benchmark S&P 500 index.The California-based utility’s shares were down about 6.6 per cent on Tuesday, bringing its total drop since the start of December — when the latest round of deadly and destructive fires broke out — to 16.7 per cent.Southern California Edison, one of Edison’s subsidiaries, says it provides services for a population of about 15m in central, coastal and southern California, where the fires have been wreaking havoc.Edison shares tumbled 12.8 per cent on December 5, as the fires started to gather strength. They started to recoup those losses until they were knocked off kilter on Tuesday following a statement from the company saying that it believed authorities’ investigation into the origin of the wildfires now includes “the possible role of its facilities.”The company added: “SCE continues to cooperate with the investigations. The wildfire investigations may take a considerable amount of time to complete. SCE will provide updated information as circumstances warrant.”The statement has sparked investor fears that Edison may be found at fault for the fires and thus on the hook for damages. Those fears echo the concerns that drove down shares of another utility that operates in California, Pacific Gas & Electric, in October amid fears about its liability for another spate of wildfires that devastated Northern California.It is unclear so far what, or who, is to blame for the latest fires, but liability for such events — depending on the circumstances — can range into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in extreme cases.That uncertainty has cast a cloud over Edison shares that could linger until a cause is identified. Its losses have put it at the bottom of the S&P 500 by midday trading on Tuesday, and have pushed the entire utilities sector to an 0.93 per cent decline, the biggest loser so far today on the index.
4;EIX;Edison International;2015-12-08T05:07:13Z;Complex deals from Texas to Arkansas via Greenland;Firms can play an increasingly central role in unlocking investment for projects to materialise;From building a port in Greenland to financing a steel mill in Arkansas, lawyers in North America are using increasingly complex funding structures to satisfy local regulations and the often conflicting demands of investors.Business needs access to capital and although trading conditions have improved considerably in the US over the past couple of years, there is still a lack of liquidity and an intense desire to safeguard investment. This year’s submissions to FT North America Innovative Lawyers have shown law firms playing an increasingly central role in unlocking investment and enabling deals and projects to be financed.In Greenland, the financing for the new national port, via the US private placement market, was helped by Morrison & Foerster partner Brian Bates, who led a team structuring the arrangement. The deal was unique in that it was a financing of specific assets — a harbour, quays and cranes — done in a way that gave the investors prior security in those assets, along with assignment of the lease from the port operator.Greenland’s laws do not have the concept of land ownership, so investors are unable to take a security interest in the underlying property rights. The laws of the country, which is an autonomous Danish dependent territory, are also unknown to most international investors.On offer were “secured notes which are secured by mortgages on the buildings to be built at the port, a collateral assignment of the lease between the company and the port’s principal operator, Royal Arctic Line, and a security interest in certain cranes which shall be installed at the port by the company following construction of the port”, all without a government guarantee or land ownership, according to the firm.Freeport LNG, creating in Texas one of the world’s largest natural gas liquefaction and export facilities in the world, hired White & Case to structure the complex funding for the project and to handle equity and debt financings for each of three liquefaction trains — liquefaction and purification facilities.“When the multi-owner structure was created the financial markets were still recovering from the global financial crisis,” the firm says. “A straightforward structure with a single project company was not a viable option.”By creating a system where there were multiple owners, FLNG was able to tap multiple financing sources, though it also created “an incredible amount of substantive and procedural complexity”, says the firm, for which the deal was led by New York partner Jason Webber. “Simpler solutions that might have been acceptable to equity investors of the liquefaction owners were flatly unacceptable to their lenders or to FLNG, and vice versa.”Another example is Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer’s advice to KfW IPEX-Bank on the financing of the world’s first flex steel mill plant, at $1.3bn the largest private investment ever in Arkansas. Investors included secured and un-secured commercial banks, hedge funds, government lenders and grant providers.“Many investors could only invest if certain conditions were satisfied, which often conflicted with the interests of other investors,” according to the firm. “With over 50 parties involved in the project, success relied on innovative inter-creditor arrangements that satisfied conflicting interests.”The varying interests ranged from clawback rights if job creation targets were not met, working capital lenders’ need for first-priority security over accounts receivable and conditions around the order in which certain loans would be funded, among other issues. Some were required by the investor, others by the law.Many investors could only invest if certain conditions were satisfied, which often conflicted with the interests of other investorsThe work was KfW’s largest financing in the US and may create at least 500 jobs, according to Freshfields. Partner Melissa Raciti-Knapp led the team on the project, which involved more than 50 parties.“The arrangements were so successful that they made for a strong bankable project,” the firm says. “Despite challenges along the way, including a lawsuit from a competitor before closing, not a single lender or other credit provider failed to honour its commitment to the project.”Other examples of North American legal teams playing a larger role in complex financing structures include Chadbourne & Parke’s work representing NRG Energy. The deal was a tax-equity financing of a $2.65bn portfolio of wind farms spread across eight states.The challenge was to find a way for NRG to make the most competitive bid for the portfolio in the midst of the Edison Mission Energy bankruptcy.Hogan Lovells also tackled similarly complex funding structures in its advice on the first securitisation of revenues from oil and gas royalties in Brazil, on behalf of BB Securities and BNP Paribas for the Rio Oil Finance Trust. The $2bn deal was the largest structured bond ever sold by an emerging markets issuer, according to the firm.
5;EIX;Edison International;2015-11-17T21:00:33Z;Batteries start to compete for power grid;Lazard predicts falling cost of electricity storage will boost solar and wind power;The cost of batteries is falling to the point that they are becoming an increasingly viable option for uses such as supporting the stability of power grids, according to Lazard, the investment bank.Electricity storage has until recently been prohibitively expensive, but its emergence at an economically viable cost will enable increased use of wind and solar power, which are not always available.The cost of renewable energy has fallen sharply over the past decade as market growth, usually encouraged by subsidies, has enabled manufacturers of wind turbines and solar panels to benefit from economies of scale.Similar trends are now at work in electricity storage with investments such as Tesla’s battery “gigafactory”, now under construction in Nevada, greatly increasing manufacturing capacity.Within five years, Lazard believes, the price of batteries is likely to have fallen to the point that they will be competitive against back-up fossil fuel power generation for a wide range of uses.“Storage is looking far more optimistic in terms of innovation and material impact now,” said George Bilicic, global leader of Lazard’s power, energy and infrastructure practice.“Power grid applications were grade school science projects a few years ago. They are much more real now.”The need for electricity storage has grown along with the use of renewable energy. Onshore wind and solar power in sunny areas are now competitive with conventional coal and gas-fired electricity generation even without subsidies, according to Lazard.However, because their output is not consistent through the day, and cannot be called on whenever needed, they have to be supported by other power sources. These are typically gas-fired “peaker” plants, which cost more to run than the most efficient generation and are used only when demand is highest.From the US to China, solar power is poised to tackle climate change and shake up the electricity industryRead moreBatteries are still typically more expensive than peaker plants for uses such as supporting the grid at times of strain or backing up renewable energy, but Lazard expects that in five years’ time they will be generally competitive options even without any subsidies or tax breaks.New electricity storage installed on to the grid to support wind and solar power is likely to grow more than 60-fold from 196 megawatts of capacity this year to 12,700MW in 2025, according to Navigant, a research firm.Jim Robo, the chief executive of NextEra Energy, told a conference in September he expected that after 2020, “there may never be another peaker built in the United States”, because electricity storage would be used instead.NextEra, which owns Florida Power & Light, a utility, is one of many US and international companies investing in storage. AES, the Virginia-based power company, is for example providing 100MW of battery storage capacity for Southern California Edison, another utility.The PJM electricity grid, which stretches from Tennessee to New Jersey, has become a centre for investment in storage because its market design rewards sources that can be brought on quickly to support the infrastructure.The cost of large high-powered batteries is falling, offering the prospect that large scale storage could transform industry. Matthew Vincent asks Clive Cookson, FT science editor, and Andy Sharman, FT motor industry correspondent, how far off this is.Widespread use of energy storage was not essential for increased reliance on renewables, said Mr Bilicic. A “blended” mix of solar, wind and gas-fired power, with improved energy efficiency, could be competitive with conventional coal plants, he added.One option to back up variable renewable energy is flexible combined-cycle gas turbine plants.General Electric and Siemens have brought on to the market new turbines that can ramp output up and down faster and with higher efficiency than previous models.However, electricity storage will make it easier to increase the contribution made by renewables, Lazard believes, and can generally be deployed faster than new gas-fired power plants.
6;EIX;Edison International;2015-06-12T16:01:24Z;US probes Infosys and Tata Consultancy over H1-B visas;Lawmakers believe hundreds of American workers have been replaced by foreigners;The US government is investigating Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, two leaders of the Indian IT outsourcing industry, over their use of visas to bring highly-skilled workers to America, according to two US lawmakers.The Department of Labor is probing potential “visa abuse” by the two companies, according to two US Senators, who say they used a US visa programme to “replace hundreds of American workers” at a power company.Most Democrats and Republicans are deeply divided over how to reform the US immigration system, but the case points to some cross-party agreement that the visas, known as H-1Bs, should not be used to displace US workers.The government probe was announced by Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Senator Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama.“We’re pleased to hear that the Labor Department is taking a first step to stanch this tide of visa abuse. A number of US employers, including some large, well-known, publicly traded corporations, have laid-off thousands of American workers and replaced them with H-1B visa holders,” they said.The Department of Labor had no comment on the details of its investigation.Indian IT outsourcing companies rely heavily on H-1B visas to allow Indian staff to work on projects in the US, as do Silicon Valley tech businesses, which have lobbied hard to increase the number of visas issued each year.The DoL investigation was sparked by a power company called Southern California Edison, which the Los Angeles Times said in February was firing domestic IT workers and replacing them with employees from Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, who had been brought in under outsourcing contracts with the companies.The report prompted the lawmakers to lead a bipartisan group of Senators who wrote to three federal agencies — including the DoL — to call for an investigation into visa abuses.Senator Durbin and Senator Sessions said: “To add insult to injury, many of the replaced American employees report that they have been forced to train the foreign workers who are taking their jobs. That’s just plain wrong and we’ll continue to press the administration to help solve this problem.”Infosys said: “Infosys is committed to complying with US immigration laws. The US Department of Labor regularly selects a percentage of visa and labour condition applications for extra scrutiny in this industry, and we work closely with the DoL to assist them in this activity in the ordinary course of our business. We have received no indication of any broader investigation of Infosys visa practices.”Tata said: “TCS maintains rigorous internal controls to ensure we are fully compliant with all regulatory requirements related to US immigration laws including those related to H-1B visas.”Southern California Edison did not respond to a request for comment.In 2013, Infosys agreed a civil settlement with the US Department of Justice over the alleged misuse of a different immigration visa, which included a $34m penalty — then the largest amount ever paid in an immigration case.The US has an annual quota of 65,000 H-1B visas and Mr Sessions has complained that companies are using them to bring in “lower-wage guest workers” even as many US graduates with science and engineering degrees struggle to find good jobs.Immigration policy and its economic impact is likely to feature prominently in the campaign for the 2016 presidential election.
7;EIX;Edison International;2013-06-23T18:34:40Z;US nuclear policy;Atomic energy should remain an important part of the mix;Pandora’s Promise, a film recently released in the US, seeks to win new allies for the cause of nuclear power on the grounds that it helps fight the threat of global warming caused by burning fossil fuels.It is a timely argument as President Barack Obama prepares for a statement on the climate on Tuesday. Unfortunately, the US nuclear industry has lost friends where it really matters: among regulators, executives and investors.This month the US utility Edison International gave up on trying to reopen its San Onofre nuclear plant in southern California because the cost of meeting regulators’ requirements would have been prohibitive.Two other US reactors are also being retired this year: Crystal River in Florida, which like San Onofre needed costly repairs, and Kewaunee in Wisconsin, which closed because power prices in its region were too low.Behind those three decisions lies the US shale revolution, which has sent gas and electricity prices tumbling. It has been clear for a while that cheap gas made building new reactors unattractive. Now it appears that even existing plants may not be commercially viable.For the long-term future of US energy supplies, this is a problem. Nuclear power provided 19 per cent of US electricity last year. If that were to disappear, much of it would be replaced by gas-fired power. Renewables have made enormous strides, and solar power in particular is becoming an increasingly competitive option in parts of the US. But without large-scale energy storage, renewables cannot be relied on to provide power whenever it is needed.Replacing nuclear power with gas would both increase carbon dioxide emissions and expose more of US energy supply to commodity price risk. Thanks to shale, gas seems likely to be the low-cost option for the foreseeable future, but over the decades-long life of a plant, that could change.So while the short-term arguments may point against nuclear power, regulators need to take a longer-term view. At San Onofre, Edison was made to meet demands that were more onerous than it had expected after a vocal campaign against the plant. With the economics of nuclear power already tricky, extra regulatory requirements can tip the balance.Safety, of course, is paramount, but regulators must make rational assessments of the risks rather than responding to political pressure. Nuclear power is an important part of the energy mix, and it should be allowed to remain so.——————————————-Letter in response to this editorial:Nuclear waste challenges are real but manageable / From Mr Armond Cohen
8;EIX;Edison International;2013-06-07T23:05:57Z;San Onofre nuclear plant latest in US to close;;One of the largest nuclear power plants in the US is to be shut down permanently, it was announced on Friday, in the latest sign of the deterioration in the industry’s economics.Edison International, the California utility, said it planned to retire both units at the San Onofre plant north of San Diego, which have not been operating since January 2012.It was the third shutdown of a nuclear plant for largely economic reasons to be announced in the US this year, as cheap natural gas and government support for renewables has made it more difficult to justify not only new nuclear construction, but even repairs to existing plants.At San Onofre, one unit had been shut down for maintenance, the other because of a leak from a tube in its steam generator, which transfers heat from the reactor to the turbine system.The US government’s Nuclear Regulatory Commission found “unexpected degradation” in the tubes in both units’ steam generators.Edison had been working to restart one unit, but faced opposition from environmental groups and objections from regulators.Ted Craver, Edison’s chief executive, said “continuing uncertainty about when or if” San Onofre would start up again was “not good for our customers, our investors, or the need to plan for our region’s long-term electricity needs”.The shutdown means the company will take a charge of $450m-$650m.Analysts said that while Edison could have pressed on with securing the regulatory approvals and making the investment needed to restart the plant, that was a less attractive option than investing in other sources of supply.The US Energy Information Administration said additional spending on gas-fired power plants and power transmission lines meant southern California would have an acceptable margin of security in its electricity supplies during the peak summer months even without any contribution from San Onofre, although that could still be threatened by problems such as wildfires.Travis Miller, director of utilities research at Morningstar, said low natural gas prices caused by the shale boom were encouraging regulators to look at alternatives to nuclear power.“Regulators are becoming more confident that investing in gas plants has lower costs and presents lower risks to customers than spending hundreds of millions of dollars and taking on the uncertainty that goes with repairing a nuclear plant.”Edison’s shares rose 2.7 per cent to $47.61 on Friday.After no retirements of nuclear plants in recent years, shutdowns of about 3,600 megawatts of capacity have been announced in 2013.Duke Energy said it would retire the Crystal River plant in Florida, which like San Onofre was shut down and needed repairs, and last month Dominion announced the closure of the Kewaunee plant in Wisconsin, which faced a tough market with low electricity prices.Damon Moglen of Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, said the San Onofre decision marked a “historic” week in the decline of the US nuclear industry.“These aging nuclear power plants are not reliable, they are not safe, and because of that they are not economic,” he said.The US Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the industry, said the problem with steam generators was “unique” to San Onofre.It added: “This is a blow to California’s energy diversity, but is not an indicator of the industry’s larger ability to reliably supply low-carbon electricity to hundreds of millions of electricity consumers from facilities operating in 31 states.”Edison said it would “pursue recovery of damages” from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which supplied the steam generators fitted at San Onofre in 2009-10.
9;EIX;Edison International;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

FOGL’s shares surged by as much as 9 per cent on Tuesday before falling back.It brings a nice historical circularity to the Falklands dispute between the UK and Argentina. The islands, after all, were originally settled by French sailors from Saint Malo – hence their Spanish name, Islas Malvinas.The sovereignty issue seems not to have bothered EDF, even though Argentina has threatened legal action against anyone investing in the Falklands, 30 years after it failed to take them by force.“The rhetoric hasn’t affected our plans so far,” Tim Bushell, FOGL’s chief executive, told Bloomberg. “It’s a tricky year because of the anniversary of the war but we hope it calms down from here.”The deal takes the form of a farm out agreement under which Edison will take a 25 per cent interest in FOGL’s northern area licences and 12.5 per cent in its southern area licences. Its share of historical costs and operations in 2012 will come to about $50m, FOGL said in a statement.Edison will contribute an additional $40m on top of $3m it paid to secure an option on the farm out agreement.Related reading:

11;EIX;Edison International;2012-03-12T21:20:16Z;Wall St steady despite global worries;;US equities were mixed on Monday as fresh economic data out of China added to growing concerns that the world’s second-largest economy was cooling.The S&P 500 was up fractionally on the day to 1,371.09 as markets reacted to news that a drop in exports had caused China’s trade deficit to widen last month and provided further evidence that global demand was slackening.Shares were sent to their worst performance in nearly three months last Tuesday after China revised down its growth forecasts for 2012. Stocks recovered later in the week as a resolution to a Greek debt restructuring deal was reached and strong non-farm payroll employment data from the US supported hopes of a labour market recovery.China’s two largest online video providers, Youku and Tudou, soared as the US-listed companies announced an all-share merger on Monday that raised the prospect of creating a profitable market leader. Shares in larger Youku climbed 27.4 per cent to $31.85, while smaller rival Tudou jumped 156.5 per cent to $39.48.Banks were leading the losers with the benchmark index’s financials off by as much as 0.8 per cent as the day began with reports that Greece’s new bonds – following last week’s debt swap – were trading at distressed levels. Citigroup recovered early day losses and ended up 0.3 per cent to $34.29, while Wells Fargo dropped 0.5 per cent to $31.51. Bank of America fell below the $8 threshold, down 0.8 per cent to $7.99 and Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $18.20.But volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, continued to fall, down 7 per cent to 15.92. The Vix, or Wall Street “fear gauge”, climbed above 20 before resettling last week as fears of global economic woes crept back into the market.The S&P 500 utilities index was the best performing sector, up 1.1 per cent. Gains were led by Constellation Energy, which added 3 per cent to $37.23 and Edison International, which climbed 1.8 per cent to $43.69.The Nasdaq Composite index moved down 0.2 per cent to 2,983.66, edging away from the 3,000 mark that it eclipsed two weeks ago for the first time since the dotcom boom. The Nasdaq fell despite gains by Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the index. The company finished up 1.3 per cent to $552.Oracle, the software company, lost 1.4 per cent to $29.71 after Jefferies lowered its rating from “buy” to “hold”.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.3 per cent to 12,959.71. The blue-chip heavy index was led by ExxonMobil, which rose 1.5 per cent to $85.55. The oil company was reported as having reached an agreement for payments with the government of Iraq for work on an oilfield in West Qurna.Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, climbed 0.2 per cent to $29.84 after being upgraded from “hold” to “buy” by Nomura.“Lowe’s has begun to make tough decisions . . . In many ways, it is following what Home Depot did three years earlier when it slowed growth, shut stores, cut costs and addressed inventory. The bottom line is that Lowe’s has begun to play offence,” said Aram Rubinson, analyst at Nomura.Rival home improvement group Home Depot was up 0.5 per cent at $48.59 even as Nomura maintained its “hold” rating on the company’s shares.United Continental Holdings, the parent of United Airlines, was down 1 per cent to $19.62 after analysts at Bank of America downgraded shares in the recently merged company from “buy” to “hold”, citing oil prices. Southwest Airlines, another US carrier, fell 2.4 per cent to $8.28.Harley-Davidson, the iconic motorcycle maker, hit a 52-week high and closed up 2.6 per cent to $48.11 after analysts at Citigroup raised its price target.Confectioner Hershey gained 1.8 per cent to $60.56. The chocolate maker was upgraded from “hold” to “buy” by equity analysts at Goldman Sachs Investor Research.Michael Kors, the retail group, fell by as much as 5.8 per cent before finishing down 2.1 per cent to $48.57. The company, which went public last December, said shareholders had agreed to waive lock-up restrictions with underwriters.American Apparel rose 21.5 per cent to $0.91 on a report that George Soros was considering offering a credit line to the struggling retailer.
12;EIX;Edison International;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Apple under pressure over board elections;;Apple will face fresh shareholder pressure at its annual meeting this month to change the way it elects directors.Calpers, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest US public pension fund, has called for the largest US company by market capitalisation to allow directors to be elected by majority voting.At present, Apple shareholders can only withhold their vote on an election of a director, rather than vote against. If a director is unopposed he only requires one vote in favour to retain the post, irrespective of how many votes are withheld.“Apple needs a governance upgrade,” said Anne Simpson, head of corporate governance for Calpers.The pension fund last year submitted a proposal that Apple adopt majority voting in its annual elections for board members. That was supported by 73 per cent of shareholders who voted last year.However, the proposal was non-binding and Apple declined to change its voting procedures, nullifying what had had been seen as a victory for shareholder rights. Calpers targeted the company as the most high profile part of a campaign by the three largest US pension funds for shareholder democracy.Apple was among 38 big US companies Calpers lobbied on the issue last year, 36 of whom then adopted majority voting. Nearly 80 per cent of S&P 500 companies have now adopted the practice, as have over half of the Russell 1000 according to Calpers. “It’s a hallmark of accountability”, said Ms Simpson.Apple has again opposed the motion. “The unusual mechanics of California law create the risk that directors who enjoy overwhelming shareholder support may fail to be elected because an insufficient number of shareholders voted in the election,” the company said in its proxy materials sent to investors.In a letter to shareholders seeking support for the proposal, Calpers argued that other California-based companies, including Cisco Systems, Edison International, and Sempra Energy, had adopted some form of majority voting. “State law is no barrier to good practice as Apple has claimed,” the letter said. Institutional Shareholder Services has also recommended that investors support the proposal.Calpers, which has around $230bn assets under management, owns 0.26 per cent of Apple. It has approached another 56 companies on majority voting this year, 29 of which have said they will make changes.At the February 23 meeting, Apple faces additional shareholder proposals asking for greater disclosure of political donations, and an advisory vote on directors pay. The National Center for Public Policy Research has also proposed that Apple publish a “conflict of interest report” detailing possible conflicts of interest between the company and its board members.The group is concerned that “Apple’s policy on greenhouse gas regulations was developed to personally benefit a board member”: Al Gore, the former US vice-president, a global warming activist whom the NCPPR says has “personal financial interests in companies that would profit from government regulation of greenhouse gases.” A spokesman for Mr Gore did not respond to a request for comment.Apple said that it already had adequate disclosure and corporate governance practices in place, and has recommended that investors vote against all the shareholder proposals.
13;EIX;Edison International;2011-10-04T22:37:44Z;S&P 500 surges 4% after dipping into bear market;;A Financial Times report that European finance ministers are discussing co-ordinated bank recapitalisations triggered a 4 per cent surge in the S&P 500 in the last 45 minutes of trading.The S&P 500 had traded as low as 1,074.77 at the start of the day’s session, well into the bear market territory that is defined by a 20 per cent drop from its year high on April 29, but the benchmark index closed up 2.3 per cent at 1,123.94, after the FT report.Bank stocks led the rebound, with financials in the S&P 500 up 4.1 per cent, reversing an earlier fall of 2.9 per cent.Morgan Stanley closed up 12.3 per cent at $14.01, having traded beneath $12 for the first time since December 2008, earlier in the session. JPMorgan rose 6.6 per cent to $30.26 and Citigroup rose 5.5 per cent to $24.39.Regional bank stocks also surged, with Fifth Third Bancorp up 8.6 per cent to $10.64 and Zions Bancorp up 7.8 per cent to $10.64.“It’s good to see a bounce in stocks. It’s been a one-way street for several days now,” said Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management. “But volatility is so high, it’s unclear which way the market will eventually go.”Utility stocks in the S&P 500 were down 0.5 per cent, the only sector of the S&P 500 to fall.NRG Energy, the power generator and electricity supplier, fell 1.8 per cent to $19.57 after decreasing its revenue guidance for the quarter on Monday evening, citing bad weather in Texas, which interrupted supply to retail customers.Northeast Utilities System fell 2.5 per cent to $31.27 and Edison International fell 2.2 per cent to $36.30.Utility stocks also fell 2.3 per cent on Monday but before that had not had a single day’s fall of more than 2 per cent since early August as investors flocked to defensive names.The reason appeared to be the heavy selling of an exchange traded fund that tracks the S&P 500’s utility sector.The Utilities Select SPDR was down 0.5 per cent to $32.66 after three blocks of more than 300,000 shares each were traded in the morning session.By midday, 10m shares had been traded in the ETF, just short of the full-day average of 11.8m.“It looks like someone is selling off the utilities ETF,” said Angie Storozynski, energy analyst at Macquarie. “Nothing could convince me to sell utilities at the moment, it’s exactly the protection I would want right now.”Some traders speculated that the sell-off was due to an institution raising funds to cover short positions as the broader index tumbled in the morning session.Semiconductor stocks performed strongly with MEMC Electronic Materials up 9.3 per cent to $5.19, Nvidia up 9.2 per cent to $12.90 and the Philadelphia semiconductor index up almost 4.2 per cent.The moves followed the release of semiconductor sales data for August, which was not as bad as expected.Romit Shah, a Nomura analyst, warned unit growth was “sub-seasonal” and predicted “another (and likely deeper) round of estimate revisions” but stocks benefited from a relief rally.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index outperform the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The Nasdaq was up 3 per cent to 2,404.82 while the Dow was up 1.4 per cent to 10,808.18.Apple fell 0.6 per cent to $372.50 on a lukewarm reception for its latest iPhone model, the 4s, unveiled Tuesday afternoon. Jefferies analyst Peter Misek tipped the stock to turn round on Wednesday.“The surface is underwhelming because the 4s looks just like the iPhone 4, but underneath the hood there is a lot to be excited about,” he said. Mr Misek also tipped the lower priced 3gs to become a “global blockbuster,” if it is rolled out worldwide at a low price.The New York Stock Exchange was up 3.5 per cent to $22.75 on reports that the European Commission may block its merger with German exchange Deutsche Börse.Yahoo rose 6.9 per cent to $14.46 on reports that private equity house Silver Lake and Russian group Digital Sky Technologies have joined Chinese ecommerce site Alibaba in its bid for the internet gateway service.Material and energy stocks which had been sold off heavily on Monday and last week, also benefited from the late buying. Alpha Natural Resources, the Appalachian metallurgical coal miner, closed up 8.8 per cent to $17.44. Its rival Cliff Natural Resources also jumped 10.6 per cent to $53.41.
14;EIX;Edison International;2011-05-31T23:56:19Z;US House votes against raising debt ceiling;;The first vote to increase the $14,300bn US borrowing limit has failed, highlighting the persistence of deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over budgetary policy two months ahead of a crucial deadline to avert a potential default.On Tuesday evening, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives overwhelmingly turned down a bill that would increase America’s debt ceiling by $2,400bn without any accompanying spending cuts.House leaders called the vote in order to prove that there was no political consensus in favour of the stance adopted by the White House and many congressional Democrats: that the debt ceiling should be increased without conditions.All Republicans voted against the legislation, while Democrats were split. Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer, the top two leaders of their party, joined the majority, while Barney Frank, the top Democrat on the financial services committee, voted in favour of the measure. The margin in favour of rejection was 318 to 97.“Raising the debt limit without major spending cuts and meaningful reforms would hurt our economy and destroy more jobs, adding to our debt crisis,” John Boehner, House speaker, said after the vote. “Today the House stood with the American people and said very clearly that this course of action is unacceptable.”Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the House budget committee, said the effort was a “political stunt”.“By threatening to default, they are simply holding jobs and the economy hostage in order to pass their extreme budget that dismantles the Medicare guarantee,” Mr Van Hollen said.Last week, the Democratic-controlled Senate turned down the Republican budget proposal – which involves deep spending cuts and a sweeping transformation of Medicare, the government healthcare programme for seniors – in a similar symbolic effort to undermine their political opponents.The mutual attempts to score political points underscore the inability of the two parties to move, at least publicly, beyond the impasse on fiscal matters that has defined the American political agenda this year.There has been some concern that investors in US government bonds could react to the rejection of the debt limit increase with nervousness, selling US Treasuries. But US Treasury bonds have continued to rally on the back of renewed weakness in the American economic recovery.And behind the scenes, a serious effort to bridge those differences is under way, led by Joe Biden, the vice-president.He has been holding regular meetings with senior administration officials, two Republicans and four Democrats, since the beginning of May, in an effort to strike a deal including sufficient spending cuts and reforms that could lead to a deal to raise the debt ceiling and prevent a default by early August.Both Mr Biden and Eric Cantor, the House majority leader and a participant in the talks, have said that more than $1,000bn in cuts are already within reach, which bodes well for the rest of the negotiations.But there are obstacles to a deal, including whether some changes to Medicare can be made, and whether any new sources of revenue – or tax increases – could be part of the agreement.Jay Carney, White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that the Biden-led talks had made progress. “We remain confident that there will be an agreement that will significantly reduce the deficit and answer the mail, if you will, with regard to those concerns [about the long-term fiscal picture] that the president and members of both parties share,” Mr Carney said.
15;EIX;Edison International;2011-05-31T23:40:46Z;Obama picks energy executive for commerce post;;"Barack Obama has selected John Bryson, former chairman of Edison International, the US energy group, to be commerce secretary, finalising the transformation of the president’s economic team and adding a voice from corporate America to his cabinet.Mr Bryson, who serves on the boards of Walt Disney and Boeing and is a senior adviser to KKR, the private equity group, would, if confirmed by the Senate, replace Gary Locke, former governor of Washington and nominee to be US ambassador to China.Mr Bryson, who shepherded Edison through the California electricity crisis and blackouts of 2000 and 2001, is known as a firm believer in energy efficiency and could serve the administration’s efforts to move the US away from fossil fuels. He is chairman of Brightsource Energy, a solar panel group; a director of Coda Automotive, which makes electric vehicles; and co-founded the Natural Resources Defense Council, a non-profit environmental group.“In the years ahead, a key to achieving our export goal will be promoting clean energy in America. It’s how we’ll reduce our dependence on foreign oil. And that’s how we’ll encourage new businesses and jobs to take root on our shores,” Mr Obama said. “John understands this better than virtually anybody.”Mr Bryson’s confirmation could be delayed by a standoff in Congress over the passage of free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. The administration insists they should move forward only if lawmakers agree to extend a training programme for workers displaced by trade.But some Republicans in the Senate are balking at that condition, while also insisting that the confirmation of Mr Obama’s choice for commerce secretary would not proceed unless the free trade agreements advance.Jay Carney, White House press secretary, said: “We think that it would be folly to hold up a nomination so important as the commerce secretary for any reason.”Mr Bryson’s nomination represents the latest sign of the White House’s effort to mend fences with the business community.One Wall Street executive who knows Mr Bryson said he was “as good as it gets”. He said Mr Bryson believed in “resource diversity and was very pragmatic but also very supportive of things that are clean-tech”. He added that Mr Bryson would be “balanced on regulation: he recognises the need for it but knows businesses need to make money”.Tom Donohue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce, was broadly supportive of the move. “With his extensive knowledge of the private sector and years of experience successfully running a major company, we hope Mr Bryson will be a strong voice for American businesses,” Mr Donohue said.The selection of Mr Bryson follows the appointment of Bill Daley, the former JPMorgan executive, to be White House chief of staff, which was widely interpreted as a signal by the Obama administration that it wanted to turn the page on its often fraught relationship with corporate America during its first two years in power.With the exception of Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, who has remained in place, the entire White House economic team has been revamped over the past year. Peter Orszag was replaced by Jack Lew as budget director, while Austan Goolsbee took over as chair of the council of economic advisers from Christina Romer. In addition, Gene Sperling supplanted Larry Summers as director of the National Economic Council."
16;EIX;Edison International;2010-06-15T15:20:32Z;GDF SUEZ actively hunting for unregulated portfolio;;"This article is provided to FT.com readers by mergermarket—a news service focused on providing actionable, origination intelligence to M&A professionals. www.mergermarket.com
——————————————————————————————————–GDF SUEZ Energy North America (GSENA) is actively seeking to acquire an unregulated power plant portfolio and has a specific asset package in PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland power pool) on its radar, a source with knowledge of the situation told mergermarket.The company has not approached the target, the source said, declining to disclose the identity of the asset package.One logical target is Edison Mission Energy (EME), the IPP (independent power producers) subsidiary of Edison Mission Group (EMG), which manages Edison International’s power generation business and other unregulated subsidiaries. It owns or leases interests in 44 power plants, with an aggregate capacity of 11,344 MW, of which EMG’s ownership share is 10,441 MW.EME has a significant amount of coal in its portfolio, which GDF finds unattractive, but it does have a presence in PJM, the source said. It also has renewable energy, which could serve as a “sweetener” for a deal, he said.EME subsidiary Midwest Generation has six plants in Illinois and most of their output is sold into PJM, according to Edison’s web site. On the renewables side, it has a biomass facility in New York and one of the largest portfolios of wind energy projects in the US, also according to the site.This news service recently reported that Ameren Corporation, a St. Louis, Missouri-based utility holding company, could try once again to sell its approximately 5,000 MW non-regulated power plant portfolio. The company had retained Goldman Sachs last year as its financial advisor on the sales process, but pulled it off the market due to pricing issues, the report said.The source said GSENA did not participate in Ameren’s auction due to its amount of coal. When asked about Dynegy, he dismissed it as a target as well, as it too has coal.Most recently, GSENA was involved in the auction for Conectiv, the source said, declining further comment on the matter. Pepco ended up selling Conectiv (3,860 MW) to Calpine on 21 April for USD 1.7bn.An industry banker said it would make sense for GSENA to take a look at BostonGen’s generation fleet, which is the third largest in New England, serving the Boston metropolitan area. It has 2,942 MW of merchant generation capacity and approximately 80% of its fleet is comprised of natural gas-fired, combined-cycle generating plants.This news service reported on 12 May that BostonGen was receiving indicative bids and it was set to draw up a shortlist. The report said Consellation Energy and First Reserve were taking a look, and an industry source said Energy Capital Partners is taking a look as well. BostonGen announced on 12 April that its Board of Managers had approved the initiation of a strategic sales process in order to restructure the company.While BostonGen is part of ISO New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont) and not PJM, ISO is a very good, liquid market, said the industry source. PJM and ISO are close geographically so it would make sense for GDF to have an interest in both areas, he said.With regard to the regulatory side, the source with knowledge said GSENA would not consider any such acquisitions as the company lacks a deep penetration into the regulated landscape. However, it would be interested in helping regulated utilities de-risk by acquiring their unregulated arms, he said. He added that any transaction would have to be immediately accretive to earnings rather than in two to three years.GSENA is a division of GDF SUEZ Energy Europe & International, which is the energy business of GDF SUEZ. It has 23 renewable plants, 60 power, cogeneration, steam and chilled water facilities and more than 7,000 MW of electric generation capacity. It serves 20% of New England’s annual natural gas demand.——————————————————————————————————–For more information or to inquire about a trial please email sales@mergermarket.com or call EMEA: + 44 (0)20 7059 6105 Americas: +1 212 686-5277 Asia-Pacific: +852 2158 9730"
17;EIX;Edison International;2009-05-18T16:31:57Z;Australia in race for biggest solar plant;;Australia plans to build one of the world’s largest solar power station networks in partnership with the private sector as part of its commitment to source 20 per cent of its needs from renewable energy by 2020.Kevin Rudd, the prime minister, said the government would invest up to A$1.4bn ($1bn, €775m, £700m) in solar energy out of the A$4.7bn Canberra has promised to spend on clean energy initiatives over the next decade.“We don’t want to be clean energy followers worldwide, we want to be clean energy leaders worldwide,” Mr Rudd said. He disclosed that the network would be three times the size of the current largest solar power plant in California.Australia’s plans mean it will join a global race to construct the world’s biggest solar plant. Earlier this year Southern California Edison, the US utility, signed up with a solar energy company to build a network of plants that would produce 1.3GW of energy, more than Australia envisages but which may take longer to finish.Proposals for big solar facilities are also being considered in regions such as the Middle East and north Africa, although these are at an early stage.Australia is one of the world’s leading coal exporters and the country derives 85 per cent of its power from burning the fuel. It has struggled to develop a domestic solar power industry, with a number of infant solar energy technologies moving to more attractive markets such as California.Canberra said this month that it would delay the introduction of its proposed emissions trading scheme (ETS) by a year, until mid-2011. It was bowing to industry calls for more time to prepare for the scheme as the country’s economy sinks into recession.At the same time, Canberra raised the upper limit of its carbon reduction target from 15 per cent to 25 per cent by 2020 and promised more industry support.Climate change was a central campaign theme for Mr Rudd when he won the 2007 election. The rethink over the ETS was a significant turnround for the prime minister, who had only a month earlier said a delay would be irresponsible.The solar power network, which is not expected to be operational before 2015, aims to produce up to 1,000MW of energy, which compares with Australia’s current energy capacity of 45,000MW.John Connor, head of the Climate Institute, an independent research group in Sydney, said Canberra’s plan to source 20 per cent of the country’s needs from renewable energy would drive an estimated A$20bn of private sector investment.“Australia and other countries can’t rely on a silver bullet, and what the government is doing is to help develop a mixed portfolio of clean energy options, which includes wind, geothermal, solar and carbon capture and storage,” he said. The mixed portfolio strategy would help develop the most commercially viable options, he added.Successful private sector tenders for the solar power network are due to be made public in the first half of next year.Additional reporting by Fiona Harvey in London
18;EIX;Edison International;2008-09-25T14:52:07Z;Who’s who: Bric leaders take their place at the top table;;"Alexei Mordashov, Severstal
Alexei Mordashov may not be the loudest or most public of Russia’s oligarchs, but he is certainly one of the most powerful. Chairman and chief executive of Severstal, the 42-year-old owns an 82.37 per cent stake in the company, enough – before Russian markets entered a tailspin – to make him the 18th richest man in the Forbes list with a net worth of $21.2bn.Mr Mordashov built his career by working his way up through the steel plants of his home town of Cherepovets, starting as an economist and becoming chief executive of post-Soviet Severstal in 1996.He sits on the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, a key big-business lobby that has the ear of both President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.He has pushed hard for Russian membership in the World Trade Organisation, but in a recent interview softened that view. “I still believe Russian membership of the WTO will be strategically beneficial for Russia as well as for the WTO members,” he said. “Of course this could only happen on fair conditions.”Analysts describe Mr Mordashov as well-respected but tough – a man who has managed to leave behind the reputation of the ruthless post-Soviet 1990s. In 2001, he took an MBA at Northumbria University in the UK’s Newcastle upon Tyne.After listing Severstal in London in 2006, Mordashov says he now runs the business seeking foremost to create value for shareholders.Severstal, Russia’s third-largest steel producer, has emerged from a failed merger attempt with Arcelor in 2006 to own assets throughout the world. A series of acquisitions in the US over the past year means the company is now the fourth-largest steel producer in the US, and controlling stakes in Italy’s Lucchini and UK-based Carrington Wire keep it strong on European markets.Severstal consolidated assets at home before venturing abroad in 2003, as Russia’s oil-fuelled economic boom began to take hold. Now it plans to invest up to $1.4bn upgrading its US assets. Bankers in Moscow say it is seeking a $1.5bn syndicated loan to finance North American investment.US production levels now match the company’s production inside Russia, according to Gregory Mason, chief executive of Severstal International, the global arm. Last year, Severstal produced about 2m tonnes of crude steel, and 2.3m tonnes of rolled steel product.High prices and boosted production meant record results for the first half of 2008, with revenue hitting $10.5bn, up 36 per cent on the same period last year. But second-half results, as Russia faces a drying debt market and plummeting markets, could be a different story.Tulsi Tanti, Suzlon Energy
Suzlon Energy, the wind energy group and the newest Indian entrant to the Boston Consulting Group’s list of Global Challengers, is perhaps the most unusual of the nation’s new breed of companies.Unlike many of the Indian groups normally included in such lists, Suzlon is not a software or telecommunications company or part of a large industrial house, and nor is its founder, Tulsi Tanti, the scion of a big business family.Mr Tanti, an ebullient entrepreneur from the mercantile state of Gujarat, started in textiles before moving into wind energy with Suzlon in 1995.Initially, his idea was to take advantage of government subsidies for renewable energy in India. But as enthusiasm for alternative energy caught on across the world, he took the business overseas, expanding rapidly through acquisitions in Belgium and most recently Germany, where he bought high-technology turbine maker Repower Systems last year.He has been criticised by some analysts for expanding too quickly at the expense of quality. Earlier this year, a unit of US-based Edison International cancelled an order for 150 turbines after some of Suzlon’s blades cracked.The company’s stock has fallen 42 per cent this year. It reported net profit in the financial year ending March of Rs12.7bn ($280m) on sales of Rs69.3bn. The company has since set aside compensation for customers with faulty blades and is selling a reinforced product.Roger Agnelli, Vale
When Brazilian mining giant Vale listed on the Paris Bourse in July, Roger Agnelli, its chief executive, reiterated his ambition for the company to become the largest mining company in the world. That might look gutsy for a company that emerged from state-ownership as recently as 1997, is head quartered in a highly bureaucratic country, and still has an archaic shareholding structure. It is a measure of success, though, that despite such handicaps Vale’s surprises are usually good ones.Vale has enjoyed excellent stewardship under Mr Agnelli since 2001. But it was only with the $18.9bn acquisition of Canada’s second-largest mining company, Inco, in October 2006 that the company became a global blue-chip. Despite fears that Vale might fluff the huge deal – with concerns ranging from cost synergies through to worker relations – the acquisition is widely acknowledged as a great success. It also generated investor support for further big acquisitions.Vale’s experience in the difficult landscape of Brazil gives it a crucial head start in working in the tough countries to which mining is increasingly gravitating. Vale’s experience of coal mining in Mozambique, where western countries enter with trepidation, points the way to successful partnerships in such countries.It is not all smooth sailing, though. The clunky shareholder structure – the government holds golden shares – chafes and is seen as a force for conservatism, although this may not be an altogether bad thing in such a volatile industry.Furthermore, since the Inco acquisition, Vale has proved less adept at executing or even explaining its acquisition strategy and was unable to seal a deal to buy Anglo-Swiss Xstrata.Finally, the commodities downturn is cooling enthusiasm for acquisitions across the sector. But the bleak short-term outlook does not disguise Vale’s strong position for long-term success.Wang Huisheng, SDIC
The life of Wang Huisheng, President and chief executive of China’s State Development and Investment Corp, tells the story of the momentous changes that have transformed China and its economy over the past half-century.Mr Wang himself identifies four “big steps” in his life since he was born in the Manchurian province of Heilongjiang in the year of the monkey in 1956.His first big challenge came when he was sent out to the countryside to toil with the peasants at the age of 18. He credits the three gruelling years he spent as a “sent- down youth” for giving him his drive and down-to-earth sensibilities as well as a sense of gratitude for what he has achieved.When he was allowed to return to the city he spent one year repairing machinery in a sock factory before he was permitted to sit the university entrance exam in the first year it was reinstated by reform-minded leader Deng Xiaoping.His second big step was being accepted into China’s Northeast Electronics University and his third was being sent up to Beijing to work for the Electronics Ministry in 1982.From there he was transferred to the country’s central planning commission, where he worked in the investment bureau for seven years before joining SDIC in 1994 – his fourth big step.In the years after he arrived in Beijing the most valuable thing he learnt was how to operate in accordance with the various regulations and ever-changing political campaigns of the country’s ”reform and opening” era.With his slight resemblance to former Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his mastery of the prevailing political slogans – “emancipate our thinking”, “build a harmonious society”, “scientific development” – Mr Wang is the ultimate Communist Party bureaucrat.But he is also the embodiment of the country’s turbulent transition from communism to capitalism – and a typical captain of industry in the world’s fastest-growing leading economy."
19;EIX;Edison International;2008-08-14T21:21:14Z;PG&E orders photovoltaic plant;;PG&E, a California power company, has placed an order for what are believed to be the world’s two biggest photovoltaic solar farms, giving a strong endorsement to a technology that few power generators have yet considered to be ready for utility-scale use.Between them the two farms, due to come on-stream in 2010 and 2011, are planned to generate 800 megawatts at peak capacity, or more than the 750 MW of the entire photovoltaic grid capacity in the US at the end of last year.The largest of the plants will cover nine square miles of farmland and produce 550 MW of power at its peak, making it “an order of magnitude” bigger than anything else built or in planning around the world, according to OptiSolar, the company that has been contracted to build the farm.Photovoltaic systems, which use solar cells to turn sunlight directly into electricity, have been considered too inefficient for utility use, though advances in new materials have steadily brought down the cost per watt of power generated.Most of the big utility solar projects have instead used concentrated solar thermal technology, which relies on large mirrors to focus the sun’s light to heat water.The fact that power can only be generated during hours of peak daylight, making it hard to match production with demand, has also reduced its attractiveness as a source of power for electricity grids.PG&E has already contracted for 1,700 MW of solar thermal generating capacity, while Southern California Edison recently announced an unusual plan to build 250 MW of photovoltaic capacity on its customers’ roofs. The rapid expansion of solar capacity in California reflects a state mandate for local utilities to produce 20 per cent of their energy from renewable sources by 2010.OptiSolar and SunPower, which is to build a separate 250 MW plant, said they were prevented by confidentiality agreements from discussing the economics of the plants, and in particular the all-important cost-per-watt of the power produced. However, the companies claimed the contracts were evidence of a leap forward in the efficiency of their technology.“This is the first time that photovoltaic solar is becoming cost-competitive with other renewables,” a spokesman for OptiSolar said.PG&E said the projects were dependent on the extension of the US federal tax credit for renewable energy.Legislation to extend the existing credits, which expire at the end of this year, has so far stalled on Capitol Hill. The solar farms also need local environmental clearance.
20;EIX;Edison International;2008-06-12T18:33:48Z;Ford calls for US help on electric cars;;Ford Motor has joined General Motors in calling for direct US government intervention to boost the market for plug-in electric vehicles, which Detroit’s carmakers fear could become dominated by Asian manufacturers.Mark Fields, head of Ford’s Americas business, said that government should be a “key partner in promoting American manufacturing” of plug-in cars and the lithium-ion batteries that power them through tax incentives, research subsidies and other measures.“A business case will not evolve, in the near term, without support from Washington,” Mr Fields said on Wednesday in a speech at Washington DC.GM, Toyota, and Renault-Nissan plan to launch plug-in cars by 2010 but Ford has not set a target for bringing one to market.It is road-testing plug-in hybrid versions of its Escape sport utility vehicle and working with utility company Southern California Edison on charging infrastructure for cars.Plug-in hybrid and electric cars are moving up global carmakers’ agendas rapidly as petrol prices soar and sales of large and inefficient vehicles plummet.Both GM and Ford are cutting jobs and production capacity of SUVs and trucks and shifting more resources into fuel-efficient cars.Tax breaks for conventional hybrid cars currently on the road, like Toyota’s market-leading Prius model, helped to promote their adoption in the US.GM is pressing Congress to offer tax incentives for extended-range electric vehicles to help defray the cost to consumers of the Volt and also wants more government support for battery development.Carmakers worry that US consumers, already stretched by high petrol prices and a slower economy, will be reluctant to pay the higher sticker prices needed to recoup plug-in cars’ development costs and new components.Japanese government support of R&D for current-generation hybrids has become a sore point for America’s struggling domestic carmakers after seeing Toyota capture most of the global market, led by the Prius.The governments of China, South Korea and India are also funding R&D on technology for plug-in hybrid and electric cars, which will have longer electric-only driving ranges than current hybrids.Development of advanced lithium-ion batteries, due to become a core automotive technology, is thus far taking place primarily in Asia, although there are some American producers.“For those looking to plug-ins to answer our energy security concerns, we must ensure a domestic battery supply,” Mr Fields said. “Moving from imported oil to imported batteries clearly wouldn’t address this growing concern.”Government should “aggressively advance” R&D and commmercialisation of lithium-ion batteries through direct funding for technology and retooling of facilities to produce electric vehicles, he said.
21;EIX;Edison International;2007-08-31T21:06:32Z;Toyota and EDF in hybrid power plan;;Toyota and EDF are teaming up to develop recharging points for plug-in hybrid electric cars in a key step forward for the emerging vehicle technology.The Japanese carmaker and French utility are due next week to announce an agreement to develop electricity infrastructure to serve the plug-in cars Toyota plans to roll out in a few years’ time. Only a few cities, London among them, have recharging points.The step is important as the future commercial viability of plug-ins will depend in large part on wide availability of recharging points.EDF’s deal with Toyota is expected to cover France initially but could be extended to other countries. The group also owns utility companies in Germany, Italy and the UK. Having adequate electricity infrastructure for the cars is important in Europe, where more motorists park on city streets overnight than in the US.Toyota’s partnership with EDF on plug-ins is not the first between a carmaker and a utility. In June, Ford Motor announced a deal with Southern California Edison to install rechargeable batteries in 20 Ford Escape sport utility vehicles, starting this year.In July, Toyota announced it had developed a plug-in vehicle and become the first manufacturer to have one certified for use on public roads in Japan. Plug-ins promise to deliver a longer driving range and lower running costs than the current hybrid cars, of which Toyota is the market leader.Separately, GM is due to unveil a new plug-in model in Frankfurt this month under its European Opel/Vauxhall brand in a further sign of its apparent intent to develop and sell the new vehicles globally. GM executives describe plug-ins as the next big paradigm shift for an industry under legislative pressure to lower emissions.Like other plug-in models GM showed in Detroit and Geneva this year, the Opel Flextreme to be shown in Frankfurt on September 10 will be powered primarily from a large battery that drivers can recharge from a wall socket or any other power outlet. But, unlike the Chevrolet-branded Volt it showed in Detroit in January, whose battery-powered electric motor is backed by a gas-powered engine, the Flextreme’s “range extender” will be a 1.3-litre diesel engine.GM’s Opel Flextreme to be shown in Frankfurt is, like the Chevy Volt, a “concept” vehicle common to motor shows. However, GM has devoted 150 engineers to the range of vehicles it is developing under the name “E-flex,” and says it plans to sell plug-ins in the US, Europe, and Japan.The size and future cost of the lithium-ion batteries to power plug-ins are a hurdle. GM has awarded contracts to Germany’s Continental and a unit of South Korea’s LG Chem to develop batteries.

Energy and materials stocks led losses, and financial stocks reversed early gains.The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1 per cent to 2,574.16, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to close at 13,337.66.Amid worries over the US financial sector’s exposure to the troubled mortgage market, Bear Stearns rebounded 0.2 per cent to $139.35, after a 3.2 per cent fall on Monday. Its plan to lend $3.2bn to one of its struggling hedge funds has aroused fears that further problems in the mortgage market are likely to emerge.The stock was as low as $137 earlier in the day. It was lifted by the expectations among analysts that the bank might only have to provide half of the planned loan.After the closing bell, Bear confirmed that it would provide about $1.6 billion in secured financing to its High-Grade Structured Credit Fund after.”By providing this secured financing facility we believe we have helped stabilize and reduce uncertainty in the marketplace,” James Cayne, chief executive officer at Bear said in a statement.Bear’s stock rose 0.4 per cent to $139.89 in after-hours trade.The S&P financial sector fell 0.2 per cent yesterday, and that pushed losses for the year to 1.9 per cent.

For the past year, new-home sales were 15.8 per cent lower than their level in May 2006.Earlier, the S&P Case-Shiller home price index for home prices in 10 US cities fell 2.7 per cent from a year ago. It was the steepest decline since 1991.“Things are a little calmer today, the housing data was pretty much in line with expectations and the dip in confidence reflects higher energy prices,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market is in a consolidation phase which is pretty typical for June.”Both the S&P and the Dow set record closes on June 4 and have subsequently struggled to sustain bullish traction.Mr Pado said that outlook should prevail unless recent lows in the S&P and the Dow – 1,488 and 13,251 respectively – are tested. “If we break through the lows, stop-loss selling will accelerate stocks to the downside.”The gloom over housing was highlighted early on Tuesday when Lennar, the home builder, reported it had swung to a second-quarter loss and warned it would likely post a loss in the third quarter. Shares fell 3.1 per cent to $37.55. The S&P homebuilder index decline of 2.5 per cent, extended its loss for the year to 27.6 per cent.In deal news, European suitors lined up for US companies.

24;EIX;Edison International;2005-07-01T16:58:26Z;Tony Tassell: Pleasant surprises;;The first half of the year hardly proved a vintage period of large stock market shocks and shifts. But the market seldom runs true to the scripts of the strategists.There were still enough surprises in the first half to defy consensus expectations. At the macro level, these included the unexpected strength of the dollar and the persistence of low bond yields. Here are a few others:● The outperformance of electricity sector. The impressive first-half performance of this sedate and somewhat arcane sector has been largely overlooked. The sector was the best-performing in FTSE this year, rising a racy 22.63 per cent.The rally has been driven by an unusual confluence of positives. Apart from a general investor appetite for yield, there has been a series of stock-specific factors, such the restructuring of British Energy, Scottish Power’s sale of PacifiCorp and International Power’s acquisition, late last year, of 13 power projects from Edison Mission Energy. Some companies also have seen margins boosted by high electricity prices, and distributors benefited from a favourable regulatory review last year.The other big sector surprise was the rally in pharmaceuticals, which defied concerns over the paucity of drug pipelines, generic competition and regulatory burdens. The sector was the fifth best performing sector so far, with a 13.5 per cent gain.● Disappointing mergers and acquisition activity. At the beginning of the year, the hype and rumours surrounding potential takeover activity reached fever pitch. An influx of private equity money had been expected to fund the takeover of a whole swathe of listed companies. It didn’t happen to quite the degree expected.Thomson Financial figures show that the value of deals with any UK involvement in the first half of the year rose to $172.6bn from $105.5bn in the same period last year. However, the latest level was down from $272.5bn in the second half of last year. However, the performance of M&A targets also did not match the hype. Morgan Stanley tracks a basket of 50 potential targets for private equity players – companies with high cash flows, low price-to-book values and high interest cover and dividend yields.This basket outperformed the market by 3.7 per cent between January 1 and Valentine’s Day. But there has been a correction since, particularly since mid-April. From then, the basket has underperformed by about 4 per cent, and, for the first half overall, it has moved basically in line with the market.● The resilience of the mid-caps. At the start of the year, a consensus call was that, with economic conditions slowing, defensive and stable big companies would outperform the more cyclical, mid-sized capitalisation stocks. At the same time, the mid-caps were trading at the start of the year at a 20 per cent valuation premium to the big caps instead of their traditional discount. But the mid-caps have held on. The FTSE 250 index has risen 7.34 per cent so far this year, compared with a 7.2 per cent gain for the FTSE 100. The impact of weaker economic conditions has been offset by bid speculation and investors pricing into valuations the prospects of interest rate cuts.● The strength of oil and gas. The FTSE Oil & Gas sector was the second-best performing market segment over the half-year as analysts played catch-up, raising earnings forecasts to match oil prices. Those investors that took profits too early, in the belief that the oil price “bubble” would soon burst, have suffered. Shell is a case in point, where UK fund managers appeared to have actually decreased their exposure recently. Merrill Lynch said this week that the top UK fund managers increased their holdings in Shell from around 104 per cent of its weighting in the FTSE All-Share at the start of the year to around 113 per cent. However, this exposure is less than a peak of 120 per cent during the first half.● Stockmarket valuations remain compressed. The recent compression of the range of valuations for stocks has been slower to unwind than many thought. Growth stocks, identified by high earnings growth, have slowly started to outperform value shares, which have higher dividends. But it has been slower than some analysts had expected. The FTSE Growth Index has gained 7.02 per cent this compared with a rise of 5.58 per cent for the FTSE Value Index.
25;EIX;Edison International;2005-05-30T20:57:53Z;Calpine sells UK power station for £500m;;Calpine, the indebted US power producer, has sold one of Britain's most modern power stations and its last UK asset to a consortium led by International Power, the UK-based electricity utility with operations on four continents, for £500m ($911m).The deal for the Saltend station in the north-east of England, due to be announced on Tuesday, underlines the interest in electricity generation in Europe as the market for power shows signs of revival after weaknesses in the past few years linked to over-capacity.In the transaction, International Power has teamed up with Mitsui, the Japanese trading house, in a 70/30 partnership to take over the Saltend unit from Calpine.The same partnership featured in a £1bn deal last year in which the UK utility and Mitsui acquired a series of global power plants previously operated by Edison Mission Energy of the US.Calpine, advised by Credit Suisse First Boston, was forced into selling Saltend after a series of financial problems linked to a big downturn at the beginning of the decade in US electricity prices.Calpine bought the UK unit shortly after it opened in 2001 for £560m, with this relatively high price connected to the relative optimism in this period about the trend for global energy prices.Several other European electricity producers expressed interest in purchasing the 1.2GW plant, powered by gas-fired turbines made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan.Among the other prospective owners of the plant were Gaz de France, Centrica of the UK and Germany's Eon and RWE.The extent of the interest is regarded as a signal that the pace of acquisitions in the power sector in Europe may be increasing.Sales of British power stations, many of them by US companies originally attracted by the liberalisation of the UK electricity market, have raised more than £5.5bn since 1999 as the industry has consolidated around just six large integrated European suppliers.The big six include EDF Energy of France, Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern from Britain, as well as RWE, Eon and Centrica. All have in the past year or so bought or announced plans to build new power stations to ensure they have sufficient generation capability to meet burgeoning sales commitments.The domination of generation and retail marketsby the big six has raised concerns about their market power by Energywatch, the UK consumer watchdog.
26;EIX;Edison International;2005-03-10T13:42:05Z;Lex: International Power;;It is a measure of the hammering that electricity generators have taken over the past few years that International Power's broadly flat 2004 results prompted cheer.However, the UK-based merchant electricity company has undeniably turned a corner since Philip Cox, chief executive, took the helm in December 2003. Its shares have gained 80 per cent since then. Recovering electricity prices have helped, as have a debt restructuring and the Edison Mission Energy acquisition last July.Lower risk contracted output now accounts for a third of IP's portfolio up from a fifth and the announcement of its first dividend reflects renewed confidence. IP's geographic spread is also paying off. In Texas, £300m of carried tax losses offer upside, while the re-start of its Hays power plant this May suggests overcapacity is falling. In Australia, where profits helped IP weather the worst of the industry downturn, tight supply is pushing up forward electricity prices. In the UK, the recent coal-linked contract signed with Centrica and an expected fall in medium-term gas prices should enhance profitability.Much of this is already priced into a 2005 price/earnings ratio of 15. But a quicker-than-anticipated recovery in the US could push that multiple below the utilities sector average of 14. Merchant electricity generation remains a relatively new, high-risk industry leveraged to power prices, but IP has definitely come out of the first crash ahead of the pack.
27;EIX;Edison International;2004-08-15T20:13:23Z;John Dizard: A year after the blackout;;"Anniversaries are a wonderful gift to journalists; they give you a predictable topic to write about when faced with a lack of obvious real-world events.They're especially useful in August, when one's sources are at the beach, and have turned off their mobile phones. So it figures that Saturday's anniversary of last year's electricity blackout in the northeastern US and eastern Canada should be marked with stories pointing out that there's been no national energy bill passed to reduce the probability of an occurrence, and little new investment in the US electric grid.With respect to my colleagues, though, that's not the story now. In the past couple of weeks, it's become clear that even without an energy bill, the trend towards a market-based organization of electricity production and distribution has pulled back from the dive it took after the fall of Enron and the bankruptcy of various generators.Two years ago, I doubted it would all turn out this way. It seemed as though only the vertically integrated major utilities, along with public authorities, were the only ones with the juice to get money out of the capital markets. Those investment bankers who hadn't become career defendants themselves were reluctant to finance people who spent most of their time responding to discovery requests.In three of the U.S. regions that have been the least friendly to market based pricing of power, as distinct from government price fixing, the tide is turning against the vertically integrated utilities. In the California legislature, a pro-utility bill sponsored by Southern California Edison has been effectively blocked by the Schwarzenegger Administration. In the Southern U.S., the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has used its authority over ""market power"" to attack the Southern Co. and Entergy Inc., the traditional utilities who have done the most to block regional energy markets. And in the Pacific Northwest, which has been the strongest base of public power companies, the utilities have set up a Transmission Issues Group that could begin to open up the government owned transmission system to market-priced electricity transactions.There is, of course, opposition to each of these initiatives from the utilities, their unions, consumer groups and their politicians and regulators. Yet there is a reason why they're losing the argument, even when they can brandish pictures of Jeffrey Skilling and Ken Lay as the representatives of traded electricity.Monopolies can generate electricity, they can do it reliably and they can get their plant and equipment financed easily. They are, however, much more expensive over time, because their reliability is based on huge amounts of redundant equipment and expensive, overbuilt bureaucracies, rather than rapidly discovered price and demand signals that result in profit or bankruptcy for the players. At some level, the public knows that the competitiveness of the economy means some cost has to be cut, and they'd rather it be a monopoly utility than their pay or health plans.In California, the Schwarzenegger Administration has proposed a pro-market bill that it really doesn't expect to be passed into law. Rather, the governor intends to appoint two new members of the Public Utility Commission by January of next year. That will give a majority on the CPUC in favor of market based electricity procurement. The utilities won't go out of business, but they'll be forced to defend their share of the retail and wholesale markets. This in a state that was the prime example of market failure just a couple of years ago.The Northwest and South will take longer to move in the direction of open regional markets. The FERC, which is the major institutional sponsor of regional markets, will have to continue to compromise with the locals. Nevertheless, the counterattack by the integrated utilities is past the high water mark.This reminds me of another market that was first developed by a fast talking, underfinanced set of hustlers who wound up in bankruptcy. The mass market for U.S. Treasury bonds was developed by Jay Cooke, a Philadelphia promoter, during the Civil War. The traditional method of financing the US government through chartered banks was inadequate. Cooke used a telegraph network and an army of salespeople to create a liquid market for the bonds, which worked. He didn't make all that much money from his trading and sales operation (rather like Enron), but used the apparent size lent by the huge transaction volume to raise money for a huge infrastructure project. In Enron's case it was telecommunications, water, generation and pipelines; in Cooke's it was the Northern Pacific Railroad. He overreached, and declared bankruptcy in 1873, helping to set off a decade-long depression.However, the successors to Cooke turned the US Treasury market into the largest and most liquid in the world. Others completed the national rail network. Cooke's morals were possibly better than Jeffrey Skilling's - he regularly donated 10% of his income to charity - but the business parallel is there.I believe there will be more bankruptcies among the independent power producers, particularly those overcommitted to expensive gas fired generation. The next wave of reorganization could start next year. This time, however, lenders and investors won't act as though the failures of unwise promoters will lead to the end of the market-based model of electricity production and distribution.

Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
