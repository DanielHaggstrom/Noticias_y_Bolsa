0;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Ross Stores racks up strong earnings though margins decline;;Ross Stores, the discount retailer, reported better than expected sales and profit growth for the past quarter but said that its operating margin fell thanks in part to higher freight costs and a pay raise for workers.Shares fell 4.7 per cent after the closing bell on Thursday following the results for Ross’s second quarter, which ended August 4.During the quarter, earnings rose to $389m from $317m in the prior-year period. Sales advanced 9 per cent to $3.7bn, with a 5 per cent increase in comparable store sales.Analysts had expected revenue of $3.65bn and net income of $376.25m, or $1.00 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Same-store sales — a key industry metric measuring growth at previously opened locations — were set to rise 2.62 per cent.Nevertheless, Ross said that its operating margin was down 13.8 per cent from last year. Barbara Rentler, chief executive, said that a higher margin on merchandise, as well as leverage for occupancy and buying costs, “were more than offset” by the freight expenses, wage increases and expenses related to packaway — the practice of off-price retailers buying this season’s merchandise on the cheap and putting it away until the next season.As a result, Ms Rentler said that the company was maintaining its forecast for same-store sales growth of 1 to 2 per cent for the third and fourth quarters. It did nudge its full-year earnings per share forecast higher to $4.01 to $4.10, up from $3.92 to $4.05.The results come near the end of a generally strong earnings season for retailers, including Walmart, Target and Home Depot, against a backdrop of a strong US economy and robust consumer spending. Even while some of the sector has struggled to adapt as consumer shopping habits evolve with the rise of e-commerce, off-price retailers like Ross have generally deflected some of the pain, thanks to their appeal to bargain hunters.Earlier this week, TJX, which operates rival stores including Marshalls and TJ Maxx, saw its shares move higher after it reported its best same-store sales growth in two years.So far this year, Ross Stores shares are up 18.8 per cent after rising 22.33 per cent in 2017.
1;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2018-05-24T20:37:42Z;Ross Stores forecast fails to impress;;Discount retailer Ross Stores took a hit on Thursday evening after better than expected earnings failed to gloss over a weak forecast for the current quarter.The company said that revenue rose 9 per cent to $3.6bn in the three months ending May 5, beating out the $3.3bn expected by analysts, according to Factset. Net earnings were boosted by a tax benefit, rising to $418m, or $1.11 a share, up from $321m, or 82 cents a share, a year ago.Analysts had been looking for net earnings of $321.02m, or 82 cents a share.Comparable sales — a key industry metric measuring sales growth at stores open at least a year — were up 3 per cent, in line with expectations. The strong earnings prompted Ross to lift its full-year earnings outlook slightly, from its previous guidance for between $3.86 and $4.03 a share to $3.92 to $4.05 a share.“Despite unfavourable weather throughout the period, we achieved above-plan growth in both sales and earnings in the first quarter,” said chief executive Barbara Rentler.But its forecast for the current quarter failed to meet Wall Street’s expectations. Ross Stores projected a 1 to 2 per cent rise in comparable sales and earnings per share between 95 and 99 cents. Analysts had been looking for $1.03 a share and comparable sales growth of about 2.6 per cent, according to Factset.While many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have been pressured by evolving shopping habits — including a shift away from malls and into e-commerce — off-price retailers like Ross have managed to thrive thanks to their popularity with bargain hunters.However, Thursday’s results underscore that they are not immune to some of the same pressures, including fierce competition in the sector from rivals like TJX Cos — which operates TJ Maxx and Marshalls stores — and Burlington, and the unpredictable effects of a colder-than-expected winter or soggy spring.After rising 22.3 per cent last year, Ross shares are up just 3.4 per cent this year. Thursday’s results sent shares 5 per cent lower in after-hours trading to $78.75.
2;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2018-03-06T21:41:57Z;Ross Stores bags strong earnings but gives cautious guidance;;Although it racked up better earnings than expected over the past quarter, Ross Stores shares sagged in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the discount retailer’s guidance for the current quarter and fiscal year underwhelmed investors. The California-based operator of Ross Dress for Less stores saw its shares fall about 2.7 per cent after releasing earnings for the 13 weeks ended February 3, which encompassed the critical holiday shopping season. The company said that comparable-store sales — a key industry metric — were up 5 per cent for the quarter compared to a 4 per cent advance during the year-ago period. That blew past the 3.1 per cent increase that analysts had expected, according to Factset. Net sales jumped 16 per cent year-on-year to $4.1bn, which chief executive Barbara Rentler credited to the company’s “ongoing success in delivering broad assortments of compelling bargains to today’s value-driven shoppers.” Analysts had been looking for sales of $3.95bn. Net earnings were boosted both by recently enacted tax reform as well as an extra week in the fiscal quarter. Net earnings were up to $451m, or $1.19 a share, up from the $301m, or 77 cents a share, from a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting net earnings of $352m, or 94 cents a share. Ross’s results are the latest to demonstrate how discount retailers — which snap up other retailers’ excess inventory to sell at a discount to bargain hunters — remain a bright spot in an otherwise tumultuous sector. Last week, TJX — the operator of TJ Maxx and Marshalls off-price retailers — saw its shares hit an all-time high after its earnings trounced expectations. But whether the good times will last is another story, particularly amid sky-high expectations and tough comparisons. Ross said that it is looking for 1 to 2 per cent comp sales growth for the current quarter as well as fiscal 2018, with earnings per share coming in at $1.03 to $1.07 for the quarter, and $3.86 to $4.03 for the full year. While the earnings forecasts are broadly in line with the $1.01 for the quarter and $3.96 for the full year that had been expected, analysts were looking for stronger comp sales growth, to about 2.5 per cent for the quarter and the year. Ms Rentler said that “our 2018 ranges reflect our plans to make competitive wage and benefit-related investments, including raising our minimum wage to $11.00 per hour. We believe these actions will allow us to continue to attract and retain talented associates.”So far this year, Ross shares are down about 1 per cent, after rising 22.3 per cent over 2017 and notching double-digit percentage growth each year since 2008. 
3;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2017-10-03T22:33:05Z;‘Off-price’ retailers show that brick-and-mortar isn’t out of fashion yet;;Retail slump? What retail slump?As conventional department stores revamp to keep pace with changing consumer preferences, off-price retailers like TJ Maxx, Marshalls, Ross Stores and Burlington are set for several years of steady growth by focusing on delivering a brick-and-mortar “treasure hunt”, according to a report from analysts at Moody’s.Moody’s analysts predict that off-price retailers — which offer designer gear and goods at discounted prices — will see their operating income grow almost 7 per cent in 2017 and 5.4 per cent next year. By contrast, department stores — like Macy’s, Nordstrom or Saks Fifth Avenue — are seen as declining 9.3 per cent this year and 2.7 per cent in the next.For the fast-evolving retail landscape, the two sub-sectors offer a study in contrasts. While department stores have been dented by declining foot traffic, off-price retailers continue to lure in shoppers, including the coveted millennial demographic, who get a thrill from combing through racks of brand-name items for the best deal.Off-price retailers “are far outstripping department stores, which in contrast, are struggling with outmoded formats and supply chains that cannot keep pace with customer demand,” the report said.Some department stores have attempted to adjust to the rise of online competitors by building digital platforms to reach shoppers on their computers or phones.But off-price retailers are less likely to prioritise online over their physical stores — indeed, the major players in the sector are set to grow their physical store footprint by more than 4 per cent this year domestically. And, according to Moody’s, e-commerce penetration is just 3 per cent in off-price retail compared to 20 per cent for the department-store sector.Department stores are trying out a slew of strategies to keep pace with changing consumer preferences: shrinking big stores, investing more in technology, teaming up with digital incumbents like Amazon and and even dipping a toe into the off-price sector, as Nordstrom has with its Nordstrom Rack line of stores.Wall Street has taken notice of off-retail’s performance over the past year, leaving the biggest players’ shares flat or up slightly compared to the heavy hit investors have dealt to department stores.Over the past year, Ross Stores is up 1 per cent, TJ Maxx and Marshalls parent TJX is down 0.7 per cent and Burlington has risen almost 20 per cent. By contrast, Macy’s is down 42 per cent, Nordstrom has dropped 13.5 per cent and Hudson’s Bay, the Canadian owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, has fallen 26.4 per cent.The report concluded:“Department stores continue to work feverishly to turn the tide and improve their delivery of value and convenience to the customer. The channel must continue to find a store experience that is going to compel customers and drive traffic to spaces that are large and sometimes inconvenient to navigate. What was once an asset (having an abundance of choice in one place) has become a liability because customers are now doing their product browsing and research online, before the store visit. Off-price continues to have the store experience to drive traffic and its supply chain and purchase is nimble to meet customer needs in relatively convenient locations– a clear winner in the changing landscape.”
4;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2017-02-28T21:29:49Z;Ross Stores strikes cautious note on 2017 despite earnings beat;;Clothing retailer Ross Stores posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday while issuing a cautious forecast for the coming year, citing “uncertainty in the political, macro-economic and retail climate.”The company — which operates discount clothing chains Ross Dress for LEss and dd’s Discounts – said that earnings per share were up 17 per cent during the three-month period ending January 28 compared to a year earlier, at 77 cents, better than the 75 cents that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected.Net earnings for the quarter were $301m, versus expectations of $294m, and revenue for the quarter came in at $3.5bn, posting an 8 per cent improvement year-over-year and squeaking past expectations for $3.45bn.Comparable store sales — a key industry metric — were up 4 per cent during the past quarter, compared to the 3 per cent that analysts expected.Chief executive Barbara Rentler said she was pleased with the results, given the highly competitive and promotional holiday season. “Our results continued to benefit from our ability to offer customers great values on a wide assortment of gifts and fashions for the family and the home,” she said.The company also announced a new $1.75bn stock buyback programme over the next two fiscal years and a 19 per cent boost to its quarterly cash dividend.Despite the earnings beat, Ross issued a conservative forecast for the coming fiscal year, predicting comparable store sales growth of 1-2 per cent, compared to the 4 per cent posted for FY 2016, and earnings per share in a range of $3.02-$3.15, just 7-11 per cent higher than the $2.83 posted in 2016.In addition to broader forces affecting the overall retail climate in the US, Ms Rentler said the company was also tempering its enthusiasm because of the “challenging sales and earnings comparisons” it faces in the coming year. “Thus, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to remain somewhat cuatious in planning our business for the 2017 fiscal year.”Ross shares, which have risen 23.8 per cent over the past 12 months, dipped 1.5 per cent in after-hours trading.
5;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2016-11-17T22:36:18Z;Ross Stores shares pop as retailer beats 3Q estimates;;Shares of Ross Stores climbed in extended trading after the discount retailer reported better than expected earnings for the third quarter on the back of robust demand for home products and women’s clothing.The California-based company said net income for the three months ended October 29 rose to $244.5m or 62 cents per share, from $215.7m or 53 cents per share a year earlier, while sales increased 11 per cent to $3.1bn. That topped analysts’s expectations for earnings of 56 cents, on sales of $3bn.Like-for-like sales, a key industry metric, rose 7 per cent and handily beat Wall Street estimates of 2.6 per cent.The company, which runs more than 1,500 stores across the country, said its operating margin of 12.6 per cent “was ahead of plan” as the growth in the number of shoppers and spending per shopper was able to offset the rise in wages.However, the company maintained its full-year guidance of 1 to 2 per cent like-for-like sales, citing “uncertainty in the macro-economic, political, and retail environments.”Shares in Ross Stores, which have climbed 22 per cent so far this year, rose another 4 per cent during extended trading to $67.80.
6;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2016-03-01T12:32:32Z;US stock futures point to higher open in March;;US stock futures suggest markets will begin March on the frontfoot after logging three consecutive monthly losses.S&P 500 futures rose 0.8 per cent in early morning to 1,945.50, Dow Jones futures were also up 0.8 per cent to 16,622.00.The rally in US futures comes as global equity markets moved higher with London’s FTSE 100 hitting a new two-month high on Tuesday and the Shanghai Composite climbing 1.7 per cent as investors reacted to efforts by Chinese policymakers to support the economy. The People’s Bank of China cut the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points after the market closed on Monday.The economic calendar in the US is light with investors watching for two separate surveys on the manufacturing sector. And with earnings season winding down just four S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report results including Dollar Tree and Ross Stores.Elsewhere, US politics come into focus as 11 states, including a number in the south, cast their votes for the Republican and Democratic nominees.
7;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2015-11-20T21:55:42Z;Nike races ahead on buyback announcement;Consumer discretionary stocks lead the S&P 500;Nike extended its lead as the best-performing stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after the US athletic apparel maker announced a new share buyback programme, lifted its dividend and approved a stock split.Nike shares jumped 5.4 per cent on Friday to $132.62 after the retailer unveiled a $12bn share buyback programme spread over the next four years. Its current $8bn repurchase programme is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2016.The Oregon-based company boosted its quarterly cash dividend by 14 per cent to $0.32 a share on a pre-split basis to be payable in January.“We think this latest move reflects an ongoing commitment to delivering healthy shareholder returns based on strong sales trends and increasing cash piles,” said Edward Plank, an analyst at Jefferies.Following in the footsteps of Netflix and Kroger, which announced stock splits earlier this year, Nike’s board also approved a two-for-one stock split of its shares. Shares will begin trading at the split-adjusted price on December 24.The split will reduce the consumer discretionary sector’s weight in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 18.3 per cent at present to about 16.7 per cent, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices.Nike shares have advanced 38 per cent so far this year as the athletic apparel maker has benefited from the so-called athleisure trend in which people increasingly wear athletic apparel outside the gym. By comparison, the Dow is nearly unchanged over the same period.Shares in Ross Stores jumped 10 per cent to $50.84 after the retailer reported better than expected earnings in the three months ended in October.The California-based company said profits jumped 12 per cent to $215.7m or 53 cents a share, in the three months ended in October, ahead of analysts’ forecasts for earnings of 50 cents a share. Sales rose 7 per cent to $2.8bn in line with estimates.Same-store sales, a key industry metric, gained 3 per cent, ahead of expectations for a 2.3 per cent rise.Foot Locker shares rose 5.7 per cent to $65.01 after the shoe retailer said third-quarter profits topped Wall Street forecasts.The New York-based retailer said profits fell 33 per cent to $80m, or 57 cents a share. Adjusting for one-time items, however, the company reported earnings of $1 a share, ahead of forecasts for 95 cents.Sales rose nearly 4 per cent to $1.8bn in line with forecasts. Same-store sales rose 8.7 per cent.Abercrombie & Fitch shares jumped 25.1 per cent to $24.38 after the teen retailer said its third-quarter profits more than doubled to $41.9m, or 60 cents a share, eclipsing analysts’ estimates.Sales fell for the 11th straight quarter but the pace of decline slowed for the second straight month.“Our third-quarter results exceeded our expectations coming into the quarter and provide the strongest validation yet that our initiatives are working,” said Arthur Martinez, executive chairman.The string of better than expected results offered some reprieve to retail stocks, which were under pressure last week after department store chains blamed the strong dollar and warm weather for disappointing results.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector climbed 1.2 per cent to lead the benchmark index.By close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 2,089.17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 17,823.81 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.6 per cent to 5,104.92.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
8;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2015-08-21T21:09:27Z;Salesforce rises on higher profit outlook;US stocks plunge on global growth fears;Investors pushed shares of Salesforce, the US tech behemoth that sells software to businesses, higher on Friday after the company lifted its full-year sales outlook for 2016 for the third time as the enterprise software market expands.Salesforce said it now expected sales for the year to range between $6.6bn and $6.625bn, ahead of its previous forecast for $6.52bn to $6.55bn. The outlook topped Wall Street forecasts for $6.55bn.The San Francisco-based company also raised its earnings outlook to range between 70 and 72 cents a share, up from 69 to 71 cents a share previously and in contrast to consensus expectations of 71 cents.The news accompanied second-quarter results that eclipsed Wall Street expectations. Salesforce reported a loss of $852,000 in the three months to the end of July, compared with a loss of $61.1m in the year ago period.Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 19 cents a share, eclipsed forecasts by a penny. Sales rose 24 per cent to $1.63bn, also ahead of analyst forecasts.Shares of Salesforce, which have gained nearly 17 per cent so far this year, gained 2.3 per cent to $69.36 in midday trading before settling to close at $69.15.Deere was among the worst performing stocks on the benchmark S&P 500, after the world’s largest maker of agricultural equipment cut its full-year profit outlook and said third-quarter sales fell amid lower demand for agricultural and construction equipment.The Illinois-based company now sees net income at $1.8bn for the year, compared with its previous guidance for $1.9bn. This was shy of analysts’ estimates for $1.93bn.Deere reported third-quarter adjusted profits of $1.53 a share, ahead of expectations for $1.44. Meanwhile, sales fell 20 per cent to $7.6bn.

The lower end of its revised forecast missed analysts’ estimates for $2.45 a share.The company projected that same-store sales, a key industry metric, would be flat to up 1 per cent in the fourth quarter, below forecasts for a 1.7 per cent gain.The news came alongside second-quarter adjusted earnings of 63 cents a share that beat expectations by 1 cent. Sales rose nearly 9 per cent to $2.9bn broadly in line with forecasts.Shares of Hewlett-Packard rose more than 5 per cent to $28.86 in midday trading after the PC and printer manufacturer delivered mixed third-quarter results. Hewlett-Packard settled to close at $27.47.The Palo Alto, California-based company reported an 8 per cent year-on-year drop in third quarter sales to $25.3bn, shy of analysts forecasts. Adjusting for one-time items earnings of 88 cents a share, topped forecasts for 85 cents a share.US stocks declined for the fourth straight day as disappointing manufacturing data out of China raised fresh concerns about the health of the world’s second-largest economy.The S&P 500 slid below the 2,000 level, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite suffered technical corrections.The S&P 500 declined 3.2 per cent to 1,970.89.

10;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Deere jumps after lifting profit forecast;US stocks fall as core inflation in April climbed more than expected;Investors took an optimistic view on shares of agricultural equipment maker Deere after the company lifted its full-year profit forecast despite a “pullback in the farm sector”.The Illinois-based company said it now expects annual profits to be $1.9bn, up $100m from a forecast that it made in February and ahead of Wall Street estimates.Deere’s optimism is tied to the construction industry in the US rather than its farms.The company expects sales to the agricultural industry to drop 24 per cent in the current year as lower crop prices and falling farm incomes weigh on demand for agricultural machinery.Sales at its construction and forestry business are expected to be up 2 per cent.However, agricultural equipment accounted for 74 per cent of the company’s revenue last year, while construction and forestry equipment accounted for about 19 per cent.The news came alongside a near 30 per cent year-on-year drop in fiscal second-quarter profits to $690.5m, or $2.03 a share ahead of forecasts. Sales fell 18 per cent to $8.2bn.“John Deere’s second-quarter results were noteworthy in light of the weak conditions that continue to affect the global agricultural sector,” said Samuel Allen, chief executive.“Deere’s construction and forestry and financial services divisions had higher results for the quarter, and our agriculture and turf operations remained solidly profitable despite lower demand for large models of farm machinery,” he added.Shares of Deere, which have gained 6 per cent so far this year, climbed 4 per cent on Friday to $93.35.Shares of Campbell Soup rose 2 per cent to $47.91, after the company behind Pepperidge Farm and its eponymous brand, topped fiscal third-quarter profit expectations.The New Jersey-based company reported profits of $182m or 58 cents a share, ahead of analysts’ forecasts for 52 cents a share.Adjusted earnings of 62 cents a share eclipsed estimates. Meanwhile, sales of $1.9bn, fell nearly 4 per cent from the previous year and missed expectations.“In addition to our productivity improvements and moderating inflation, we achieved net price realisation by reducing promotional spending and taking pricing actions on the core businesses,” said Denise Morrison, chief executive.The company also estimates full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $2.32 to $2.38 a share, with the high end of the range above forecasts.However it said it expects sales in the lower end of the previously announced range of minus 1 per cent to 1 per cent growth.Aéropostale shares fell 15 per cent to $2.19, after the teen clothing retailer reported a wider than expected first-quarter loss and sales that fell short of analyst expectations.The New York-based company also said same-store sales, a key industry metric, fell 11 per cent and issued second-quarter guidance that missed forecasts.Aéropostale now expects a loss of 52-60 cents a share, wider than forecasts for a loss of 37 cents a share. It also said it expects sales of $318.6m, below estimates for $326.2m.Shares of Ross Stores slid 4 per cent to $97.03, after the retailer issued second-quarter earnings guidance that missed forecasts.US stocks declined modestly on Friday as core inflation climbed more than forecast.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 per cent to 2,126.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.3 per cent to 18,232.02 and the Nasdaq Composite was little changed at 5,091.36.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
11;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2014-08-29T17:20:20Z;US financials enjoy strong August gains;Nine in 10 S&P 500 stocks advance as economic data improve;Investors returned to US equity markets in August, sending the benchmark S&P 500 up 3.7 per cent – its best performance since February – as economic data broadly improved.Nine in 10 stocks on the S&P 500 advanced during the month, led by those companies tied to an expanding economy, including the financial, technology and consumer goods sectors.Financials proved particularly attractive, seeing the greatest monthly advance since the autumn of 2013 after lagging behind broader equity markets this year.Pummelled by increased regulation and lacklustre economic growth at the start of the year, investors shifted their view on banks in the period, sending the S&P 500 financials index up 4.9 per cent over the month.Asset managers and financial service providers accounted for much of the gains, although nearly 98 per cent of stocks within the index climbed over the period.Analysts with Credit Suisse noted the financial sector had been aided by improving credit quality and loans, in part buoyed by the five-year bull market rally. Higher capital ratios have also left banks less vulnerable to unexpected shocks.“Credit quality trends improved, although at a slowing pace,” Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with the bank, said of second-quarter results. “Loan loss reserves continue to decline at every large bank in our coverage universe.”The end of stimulus measures in the US could lift the sector as well, as spreads on some products rise. Improving economic data in August have also buoyed the sector, as rising manufacturing and construction activity point to increased lending needs.Jonathan Glionna, a strategist with Barclays, said net interest margins were likely to improve as the Federal Reserve lifted rates. He noted interest income represented 60 per cent of average revenue at S&P 500 banks.“Their balance sheets are positioned to respond favourably to higher interest rates,” Mr Glionna said. “In addition, banks will benefit from the economic conditions that typically coincide with higher interest rates, such as lower unemployment.”Strategists with Goldman Sachs said cyclical stocks, including technology companies, could benefit in the 12 months ahead of a rate rise – which it expects will happen by autumn 2015.“Cyclical equities tend to outperform the index during the lead-up to rate hikes,” David Kostin, a strategist with Goldman, said. “Information technology has outperformed on average, although these results are skewed by the dotcom bubble coinciding with the interest rate hikes of 1999.”Genworth Financial climbed 8 per cent during the month to $14.19, Morgan Stanley advanced 6 per cent to $34.31, BlackRock rose 8 per cent to $330.53 and Hartford Financial increased 8 per cent to $37.05.Companies tied to the US consumer, including Ross Stores, Home Depot and Gap, also rallied over the course of the month, despite discounting by rivals and weak mall traffic.The movement was tied to earnings, as all three eclipsed Wall Street expectations. Both Gap and Home Depot lifted guidance, on rosier second half expectations.Analysts with IHS noted the back-to-school selling season looked relatively good, although overall growth would probably fall short of the 2013 rate when sales in the period reached $573bn.Ross gained 17 per cent in August to $75.42, Home Depot climbed 15 per cent to $93.50 and Gap rose 15 per cent to $46.15.Telecoms was the only sector to decline over the month, as investors sold off positions in AT&T, Windstream Holdings and Verizon.Higher interest rates may constrain the industry’s performance, Mr Glionna warned, particularly as the companies make infrastructure investments.AT&T fell 2 per cent over the month to $34.96 while Windstream declined 1 per cent to $11.30.For the month, the S&P 500 advanced 3.8 per cent to 2,003.37, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.2 per cent to 17,098.45 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 4.8 per cent to 4,580.27.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
12;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2014-08-22T17:10:04Z;Ross Stores’ strong earnings helps lift US retail sector;;"Retailers finished the week on a high note after a flurry of earnings reports.Discount retailer Ross Stores led the S&P retail sector, trading 7 per cent higher at $74.37. At least four analysts raised their target price after the company reported better than expected sales and profits on Thursday.Net income for the three months ended August 2 rose 12 per cent to $239m, while sales increased 7 per cent to $2.7bn. Comparable store sales, the industry’s key metric, rose 2 per cent.The California retailer has benefited from the consumer trend for bargain hunting. Operating margin for the quarter increased 14 per cent, driven by higher merchandise gross margins and tighter cost controls.The company, valued at $15.6bn, forecast annual earnings per share between $4.18 and $4.26, up from $3.88 the year prior.Strong earnings also lifted a number of other retailers, despite a slightly weak performance on the S&P 500. By close, the S&P retail index had gained 0.7 per cent, compared to the S&P 500’s loss of 0.2 per cent.Shares in Foot Locker reached an all-time intraday high of $55, after the New York-based footwear company beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter earnings.Foot Locker reported profits of $92m, a 39 per cent jump from results a year ago, due to healthy sales of basketball and running shoes. Foot Locker’s second quarter sales grew 13 per cent to $1.64bn, compared to analyst forecasts of $1.57bn.Investors have remained steadily bullish on Foot Locker, pushing the company’s share price up about 30 per cent since the start of the year and closer to 60 per cent in the past 12 months.Gap topped earnings expectations, sending the company’s stock 5 per cent higher, as the fashion chain also announced an expansion into India to capitalise on stronger demand from emerging markets for Western-style clothing.Gap is trying to fill the hole of slowing sales in North America by pushing into Asia; the company said in April it expected sales in China to triple in the next three years.Gap raised its full-year profit forecast to $2.95-$3.00 per share, from $2.90-$2.95 per share. The retailer also reported profits of $332m, or 75 cents per share, compared to analyst forecasts for 69 cents per share.But not all retailers managed a positive week. Aéropostale fell 10 per cent to $3.52 on Friday. The company reported a bigger-than-expected loss on Thursday and same-store sales fell 13 per cent. On Tuesday, the company’s shares rose 20 per cent after it reappointed its former chief executive Julian Geiger to lead the company.Ann Taylor also disappointed investors by cutting its sales outlook, pushing its stock down 3 per cent to $37.52.The clothing company continued to suffer from weak sales as consumers cut back on spending, although it did meet Wall Street expectations for profits.Several energy stocks were down as oil prices dropped slightly primarily due to increased supplies and easing geopolitical tensions.Transocean fell 2 per cent to $37.97, Cabot fell 1.5 per cent to $33.00 and Hess dropped 1 per cent to $98.81. Nabor Industries fell 2 per cent to $25.29 and Diamond Offshore dropped 2 per cent to $43.21.Shares in US electricity provider Dynegy, however, rose 9 per cent to $32.32 on news of a $6.25bn deal for a series of power plants from Duke Energy and a set of assets from Energy Capital.The company, which emerged from bankruptcy less than two years ago, forecast purchases would “significantly improve” its financial outlook by tripling its 2015 adjusted ebitda. Shares in Duke Energy were little changed at $72.87.Overall US equities were mixed following a speech on the US economy from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,988.41, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average loss 0.2 per cent at 17,001.22. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 4,538.55."
13;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2014-08-19T17:08:07Z;Home Depot benefits from DIY resurgence;;Home Depot hammered out a strong performance in a resurgence in the retail sector, joining US chain store groups to report better results for the latest quarter.America’s largest DIY chain reported second-quarter earnings and same-store sales that both topped Wall Street’s expectations and raised its full-year profit forecast, sending its shares up nearly 6 per cent to $88.19.Same-store sales at its 2,264 stores in the US climbed 5.8 per cent, eclipsing a 4.4 per cent forecast, and pushing overall revenues up 5.7 per cent to $23.8bn as customers spent more on home repairs after a severe North American winter.Profits climbed 14.2 per cent to $2.1bn, or $1.52 a share. The company expected to earn $1.44 a share.The retailer also promised another $3.5bn worth of share buybacks for the rest of the year.Home Depot’s shares had previously lagged behind the broader S&P 500 index performance. However, by the close of trading it had matched the overall market gain of 7.6 per cent in the year to date.Fresh optimism over the consumer and housing sector also lifted shares in Lowe’s, another home improvement retailer, ahead of its second-quarter earnings expected on Wednesday.Shares rose 2 per cent to $51.52, building on gains on Monday after Credit Suisse analysts upgraded the company to a ‘buy’ recommendation.Among other retailers to shine was TJX Companies, owner of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, surging almost 9 per cent at $58.56.The company reported an 8 per cent increase in net income for the quarter ended August 2, earning $518m over the period.Higher than expected store sales drove earnings, in addition to improved merchandise margins and clothing sales, the company said.The company reported an adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents, exceeding analysts’ expectations of 73 cents. The retailer also narrowed its full-year earnings forecast to a range between $3.08 and $3.16 per share, from between $3.05 and $3.17 previously.Shares in Ross Stores, a fellow discount retailer, rose 4 per cent at $69.31 on the back of the more positive sector news, ahead of its own second-quarter earnings release on Thursday.Teen clothing retailer Aéropostale regained investor confidence after reappointing Julian Geiger as its chief executive. During his previous stint as CEO between 1996 and 2009, Mr Geiger helped grow sales to $1.9bn by 2008.News of the appointment sent the shares up 19 per cent to $3.87. However the company’s stock is still nearly 60 per cent lower than a year ago.The ever fickle teen market has plagued a number of companies.Shares in Elizabeth Arden fell 23 per cent at $15.05 after announcing a worse than expected sales decline in the fourth quarter. The beauty products company reported a net loss of $157m, or $5.24 a share.Poor sales of celebrity fragrances, such as Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift brands, contributed to the decline. Revenues plunged 28 per cent in the three months ended in June, to $192m, a significantly bigger decline than analysts had expected.In a bid to reassure investors, Elizabeth Arden said next year it would continue to focus on stabilising the business as it embarked on a multiyear plan to restore profitability. It also announced a strategic investment by Rhône Capital, the private equity firm that last year took an investment in Arden competitor Coty.Shares in the home building sector had a second day of gains on the basis of improving data. Following on a positive home builder sentiment survey released the previous day, the latest report from the US commerce department showed the pace of building on new homes rebounded in July to its highest level since November.Shares in PulteGroup rose 1 per cent to $19.06, DR Horton added 3 per cent to $21.82 and Lennar gained 3 per cent to $38.80.Overall US equities were stronger. The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent at 1,981.60, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent at 16,919.59. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.4 per cent at 4,527.51.
14;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2014-07-08T18:29:19Z;The right capital structure for bricks and mortar retail?;;"Lex recently wrote about the hurly-burly around PetSmart, the pet supply chain. An activist or two is keen for the company to sell, and have also made noises about things like returning capital to shareholders. Looking at the numbers, private equity ownership or a big one-time payout don’t look like silly ideas. This is a very stable business that generates a good amount of cash, and it currently has no debt on it.The last point got me thinking, and I ran a company screen on S&P Capital IQ of big retail companies that carry no debt, and a long list came back: H&M; Costco; TJX; The Gap; Ross Stores; Whole Foods; Advance Auto Parts; Bed Bath and Beyond; Best Buy; Williams-Sonoma; Foot Locker; Game Stop; Urban Outfitters. Many more as well.Unscientifically, it struck me that there was an unusual number of companies in this industry with no debt in the capital structure – despite the presence on that list of a number of quite steady, cashy enterprises. I’m wondering if experienced retail leaders are, as a group, nervous about debt, and whether this is rational or not.Any thoughts?"
15;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2013-08-22T15:14:48Z;US clothing retail: mall rats;Might the mall store model be in gradual decline?;There is trouble at the mall. Abercrombie & Fitch reported a 10 per cent drop in comparable sales on Thursday. Next door at rival American Eagle Outfitters they fell 7 per cent. In the background, big anchor stores such as JC Penney and Sears continue to struggle mightily.Some stores are going strong. Urban Outfitters reported a 9 per cent jump in comparable sales. But consumers with cash to spend are being very discriminating. They are spending for sturdy home improvements – comparative stores sales at Home Depot and Lowe’s were up 11 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively – rather than flimsy apparel. In addition to weakness at speciality retailers, same-store sales fell at Macy’s department stores. And where they like to buy apparel is changing. Off-price retailers such as TJX – sales up 4 per last quarter, by the way – and Ross Stores, which sell a number of brands, have been growing fast for years.Might the mall store model be in gradual decline? The companies that are on the upswing, Urban Outfitters, J. Crew, Gap, have vibrant online businesses. And according to ShopperTrak, traffic at enclosed malls in the US this year is running about flat to 2012 levels. In spite of a jump right after the financial crisis, mall traffic has been declining since 2000. That is not to say that mass bulldozing of malls is imminent – there were a staggering 8.5bn visits in 2012 – but that the chasm between winners and losers is set to widen.Stock valuations reflect these patterns. Shares of American Eagle and Abercrombie – the latter fell 18 per cent on Thursday – trade at 15 and 13 times forward earnings versus Urban Outfitters at 21 times and TJX at 18. Yet it is the stocks with the low earnings multiples that look expensive. Shoppers are being picky about what, where and how they buy. Investors should do the same.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
16;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2013-01-03T21:40:45Z;US equities fall after post-deal rally;;"US retailers were in focus on Wall Street on Thursday after the release of monthly sales results. Even though overall retail same-store sales figures were lacklustre, the S&P 500 retail sector gained 0.4 per cent.Department stores and clothing chains targeted at young consumers reported sales that were better than estimated, while discount chains had disappointing figures.Daniela Nedialkova, retail analyst at Atlantic Equities, was cautious about retailers with better than expected sales: “While expectations have been moving lower in recent weeks on reports of weak traffic and deep discounts, there were some outperformers. Those were, however, primarily on the value end of the spectrum. A number [of retailers] mentioned that sales came in late during the month, and additional discounts were needed.” Among the winners, TJX shares rose 3.3 per cent to $44.58 after the owner of TJ Maxx stores reported a 6 per cent increase in sales and raised fourth-quarter and full-year earnings outlook.Shares in Ross Stores, which operates discount retail clothing and home fashion stores across the US, rose 8 per cent to $58.78, as monthly comparable sales topped expectations.Gap shares rose after the clothing retailer reported a 5 per cent increase in same-store sales in December, beating an estimate of 3.5 per cent. Gap also announced a $1bn share buyback programme. The shares gained 2.3 per cent to $32.09.In contrast, Family Dollar Store shares tumbled after the discount stores operator missed earnings estimates for the fourth quarter. It fell 13 per cent to $55.74.Rival discount chains, such as Dollar General and Dollar Tree also fell, down 2 per cent to $42.04 and 1.1 per cent to $39.47 respectively.Limited Brandswas another heavy faller, down 5.7 per cent to $44.71, as the owner of Victoria’s Secret missed expectations for sales growth.Carmakers attracted buyers, as auto sales jumped by more than 13 per cent, with the big three US carmakers reporting robust growth increases.GM shares rose 2.4 per cent to $29.82, while Ford added 2 per cent to $13.46.The rest of the equity markets closed lower on Thursday, in contrast to the previous session’s 2.5 per cent gain after lawmakers in Washington this week reached a partial budget deal.Nicolas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, described the rally as emotional rather than rational and cautioned about further fiscal friction: “The deal struck between Democrats and Republicans leaves a lot of unanswered questions, including a still-needed increase to the federal debt limit, spending cuts to replace the 2011 sequestrations no one liked, and a reasonable approach to containing the long-term growth of healthcare expenses in programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.”The S&P 500 index see-sawed but fee after the release of the Fed minutes from the last FOMC meeting, which showed that officials were split on whether to keep purchasing bonds until the end of 2013. The benchmark closed 0.2 per cent lower at 1,459.37.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 0.2 per cent to 13,391.36.A technical issue with the ‘stale data’ on the consolidated tape caused a temporary price freeze on the Nasdaq index in the afternoon trading.Nasdaq OMX reported that the issue had been resolved without providing much detail into what caused the price freeze.
The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.4 per cent lower at 3,100.57, dragged down by sharp declines in its biggest members.Apple declined 1.2 per cent to $542.44, Microsoft also shed 1.2 per cent to $27.28. Google erased earlier gains to close only marginally higher at $723.72, as the US regulator cleared the group’s core search business ending a sweeping antitrust investigation.Transocean shares rallied 6.4 per cent to $49.21 after it agreed a $1.4bn settlement with the Justice Department to resolve civil and criminal claims against it after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010.Coal producers Consol Energy and Peabody Energy rose, each adding 3 per cent to $31.93 and $26.64 respectively.Analysts at Deutsche Bank cut ratings on healthcare insurers UnitedHealth and WellPoint to “hold” from “buy” saying that premium price hikes lagged behind increases in medical costs. Shares in UnitedHealth fell 4.7 per cent to $51.99, while WellPoint lost 3.3 per cent to $58.93."
17;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2013-01-02T19:51:01Z;US payroll tax - change hurts;Tax rise seen to threaten middle-tier retailers;"News that the president and Congress had passed a budget deal turned the US stock market into a sea of green on Wednesday. But there were a few red sharks splashing around out there. A conspicuous number of these were shares of companies that depend on the working-class consumer. Discounter Dollar General was down 2 per cent, as was middle-income department store operator Kohl’s; big-box retailer Target lost 1.5 per cent; off-price clothing chain Ross Stores was hit too.This makes sense, given that anyone living pay cheque to pay cheque is about to see higher taxes. When the president said the compromise had prevented income tax rates on the middle class from going up, he was talking out of the side of his mouth. The deal included the expiry of the so-called “holiday” on payroll taxes, meaning the tax will rise 2 percentage points, to 6.2 per cent.Both parties have reasons to love the payroll tax cut – the Republicans simply because it is a tax; the Democrats because it is regressive. Why it was made only temporarily and then not extended is unclear. The point is that the change will hurt. JPMorgan’s economics team reckons that if three-quarters of the additional money in consumers’ pay cheques was being spent rather than saved, the hit to retail spending would be $95bn, slowing gross domestic product growth by six-tenths of a per cent in 2013.Last year, consumer discretionary stocks easily outpaced the wider market and surveys of consumer confidence are showing an encouraging trend. But hours worked and wages have not been growing at all. Now wages will, in effect, shrink. Back in November Barclays’ strategists pointed out that the payroll tax increase posed a particular threat to middle-tier retailers. As of today, that looks like a prescient call.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
18;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2012-08-16T20:47:48Z;New low for Facebook as US stocks edge up;US equities near post-crisis high reached in April;Shares in Facebook fell sharply to a fresh low on Thursday, as a lock-up period that had prevented some shareholders from selling their shares expired.The stock closed below $20 for the first time at $19.87, down 6.3 per cent on the day. Volume was very heavy with 156.7m shares traded over the day, triple Wednesday’s total volume.The social networking site has lost nearly 48 per cent in the 90 days since its listing and is set to face further pressure as more shares can now be freely sold. Of the 1.9bn shares that will eventually become available to trade in the market, 271m were released on Thursday – more than half of the 421m shares that were sold in the social networking website’s initial public offering in May.Scott Kessler, analyst at S&P Capital IQ, who set a 12-month target price of $25, said: “This is a momentum trade. Investors are not driven by fundamentals [now], but they are driven by emotions.”He added that depressed prices left the stock “attractive”, although investors are still unconvinced by the company’s long-term growth model.Ken Sena, analyst at Evercore Partners, echoed this view: “We view the next six months as possibly providing a more attractive buying opportunity, given that over one billion new shares are likely to come to market.”The broader markets received a boost after Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, appeared to support the European Central Bank’s efforts to ease eurozone debt woes.The S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent to 1,415.51. The benchmark index is now just 0.3 per cent below April’s closing high of 1,419 – its post-financial crisis peak – and has rebounded more than 10 per cent from its low in June.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.7 per cent to 13,250.11, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose 1 per cent to 3,062.39.“Most investors are acting as though the market is stumbling but, by every measure and despite fears, the stock market is having a great year,” said Scott Wren, equity strategist at Wells Fargo.The Vix index, a short-term measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500, which is trading at a five-year low, closed at 14.29.Still, the S&P Growth Index has increased almost 13 per cent so far this year to its highest level for more than a decade, which suggests that investors remained cautious and were seeking out US equities with better earnings and strong balance sheets.Elsewhere, the newly listed Manchester United dropped below its IPO price of $14 to $13.77, down 2 per cent.In earnings news, Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales, slipped 3.1 per cent to $72.15 after a stronger dollar took its toll on international sales. Total revenues fell and were below Wall Street expectations.Sears added 6.5 per cent to $60.29 after the US department store reported narrower losses than analysts had expected.By contrast, Ross Stores edged 0.1 per cent lower to $68.46 after the discount clothing chain lowered its growth outlook for the rest of the year.Gap traded at $35.00 in extended trading – a gain of 2 per cent – after the company’s quarterly results beat analysts’ estimates and it raised guidance for the fiscal full year.Information technology was the leader among the S&P’s 10 big sectors, closing up 1.5 per cent.Cisco, one of the members of that sector and also one of the top-10 weighted companies in the Nasdaq, climbed 9.6 per cent to a three-month high of $19.02.The company, which makes networking equipment, beat earnings expectations and surprised investors by increasing its quarterly dividend by 75 per cent to 14 cents per share.But some long-term bearishness has surfaced about the blue-chip stock as technology development threatens to decouple networking from Cisco’s routing and switching gear.Alex Henderson, analyst at Needham, said: “We note the higher dividend will probably curtail some of the buybacks.”“Market concerns have been growing over the impact of software defined networking – which remains in its infancy – to Cisco’s long-term growth trends and economics,” noted Brian White, senior analyst at Topeka Capital, who favours the stock.Verizon edged 0.2 per cent lower to $44.12. The company got the approval of US regulators for a $3.6bn purchase of spectrum.Direct rival AT&T dropped 0.4 per cent to $37.24.
19;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2012-04-05T13:40:15Z;Upbeat consumers boost US retailers;;An improving jobs market and unusually warm weather helped to lift US retail sales in March by nearly 4 per cent, beating Wall Street expectations and continuing a run of positive months.Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.9 per cent at the 20 or so at the retailers that report monthly figures, according to Retail Metrics, revealing little evidence of higher petrol prices crimping spending.“In general, there was real strength across the retail sector, across all parts of the value chain from luxury down to deep discounters,” said Joel Bines, a retail analyst at AlixPartners.Warm weather encouraged people to continue early spring clothes shopping, a trend that began in February.“Those [retailers] who missed [expectations] missed because of product and price, not because the consumer was not out shopping,” said Mr Bines.Gap, the clothes retailer, reported a second consecutive month of rising sales: at Gap-branded stores in North America they were up 9 per cent following a 1 per cent gain in February, when it started selling clothes from a new creative team.At TJX and Ross Stores, two leading discounters of clothes and household wares, sales rose 10 per cent from a year ago.At Target, the mass-market discounter, sales rose 7.3 per cent and Macy’s, a department store, also reported a 7.3 per cent increase.Mr Bines said clothes retailers could also claim credit for rolling out an attractive set of spring fashions.“Walking into the typical mall is like walking into a tulip garden. There is so much colour and freshness that it is really remarkable. It’s really resonating with the consumer,” he said.
20;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2012-03-01T17:27:10Z;Gap and Target post strong February sales;;US retailers recorded better than expected sales in February as positive economic news and warm weather prompted an early start to spring shopping.New fashion items at Gap helped generate its first sales growth in seven months as overall retail sales grew 6.5 per cent from a year ago among the 20 or so companies that report monthly figures.The gain was the biggest since June 2011, according to Retail Metrics. Sales at Target, the mass-market discounter, rose 7 per cent and Macy’s, the department store, posted a 4.6 per cent increase.Barbara Kahn, marketing professor at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, said the strong sales figures reflected higher consumer confidence and lower unemployment and indicated that growing concern over rising gas prices was not yet inhibiting spending.But she added that Gap’s fortunes were a reminder that: “Consumers have to want to shop, but there has to be something in the stores they want to buy too.”At stores open at least a year, sales of the Gap brand in North America rose 1 per cent in February, as it started selling clothes from a new creative team that is aiming to reverse Gap’s long decline into dowdiness.“Customers responded well to our spring product,” said Glenn Murphy, chief executive. Last week Gap had reported a bleak Christmas.Keith Jelinek of AlixPartners, a consultancy, said warm temperatures had encouraged shoppers to start buying spring clothes and outdoor furniture: “Retailers always want to blame the weather, but the weather definitely helped because this time last year we had very serious storms that pushed people inside.”Another month of strong growth at stores that specialise in cut-price goods, with 9 per cent increases at both TJX and Ross Stores, suggested consumers remain cost-conscious.“They’re being very precise in what they want to buy. They’re not updating their whole wardrobe. They’re being wise with their spend,” Mr Jelinek said.Last week, Walmart, which does not report monthly sales, said US unemployment had not yet fallen to a level where financial pressure on its core low-income customers had visibly eased. On Thursday the retailer, the world’s biggest by sales, said it would raise its annual dividend 9 per cent to $1.59 per share.At Limited Brands, which owns the store chains Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and Henri Bendel, sales rose 8 per cent in February.
21;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2012-01-06T22:00:11Z;US stocks start year on front foot;Strong US data buoy markets;US stocks started the year on an upbeat note as economic data continued to surprise on the upside.By the close yesterday, the S&P 500 was 1.8 per cent higher over the week at 1,280.68, breaking above its 200-day moving average, an indication some investors think the rally has further to run.After opening lower on Wednesday and Thursday, the benchmark index turned positive each day as stocks gathered momentum, almost repeating the trick on Friday but closing down slightly.“At open, the market is still dominated by European fears,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers Investment Research. “But it’s a positive sign that bulls are tending to take charge on the realisation that the US economy appears to be improving faster than expected.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average produced a weekly gain of 1.2 per cent at 12,359.92, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.7 per cent to 2,674.22.Stocks along the hard disk drive supply chain rallied on higher than expected fourth-quarter shipments. Seagate Technology said it had dispatched 47m hard disk drives in the three months to January in a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected. Seagate climbed 11.6 per cent to $18.30, while rival manufacturer Western Digital rose 8.2 per cent to $33.49.Semiconductor manufacturers LSI Corp, up 12.9 per cent to $6.72, and Micron Technology, up 14.5 per cent to $7.21, rallied in anticipation of stronger demand for computer memory chips.Bank of America climbed 11.2 per cent to $6.18, topping $6 for the first time since November, on the back of its strongest one day gain since October on Thursday. Analysts struggled to explain the stellar performance, which came as Citigroup analysts slashed earnings estimates for BofA, citing costs to settle mortgage-related lawsuits. Some suggested arbitrageurs might be buying BofA shares after the cost of protecting against a default by the bank fell in December without a corresponding rally in the stock price.Talk of a possible government plan to boost the housing market sent shares in homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.5 per cent to $7.10.It might also have helped large mortgage lenders outperform – SunTrust was up 11.6 per cent to $19.75 and Hudson City Bank, a New Jersey-based mortgage lender, rose 9.3 per cent to $6.83. But investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, lagged behind the pack.Goldman Sachs was up just 3.3 per cent to $93.42 while Jefferies climbed only 0.7 per cent to $13.85. Douglas Sipkin, of Ticonderoga Securities, slashed his quarterly earnings forecast for Goldman to 97 cents a share from $4.12 and tipped Morgan Stanley for a 59 cents a share loss, citing the weak trading environment.But Mr Sipkin said US investment banks could benefit from “widening bid- ask spreads, driven by the major retrenchment of European competitors”.CME Group, the largest US exchange by market capitalisation, fell 4 per cent to $234.00 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 4.6 per cent to $115.01 as JPMorgan analysts downgraded both exchanges to neutral, arguing that the companies’ estimates appeared optimistic and might have to be revised down.MasterCard fell 8 per cent to $342.92 as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its “buy” recommendation on the stock as well as Visa.Chesapeake Energy climbed 7.6 per cent to $23.98 after concluding a $2.3bn joint venture with French oil giant Total and EnerVest for shale gas and oil exploration in Ohio.Investor reaction was initially muted but the stock rallied late in the week, when the company said it had used JV revenues to reduce debt by $1.4bn to $10.3bn in the fourth quarter.Devon Energy was up 4.4 per cent to $64.75 after concluding its own $2.5bn shale joint venture with China’s Sinopec. But refiners sold off sharply after Tesoro said it could post a fourth-quarter loss of up to 80 cents a share because of collapsing margins.

Metal, mining and energy stocks soared on rising commodity prices, and hopes that monetary easing in China would offer support to the country’s resource-intensive construction industry.Steel stocks performed particularly strongly with Alpha Natural Resources, which mines metallurgical coal used in steelmaking, rising 28.2 per cent to $24.11, AK Steel Holding rose 16.8 per cent to $8.22 and US Steel climbed 24.9 per cent to $27.81.“The Policy accommodation may support Chinese steel consumption, reducing the chances of oversupply, which would depress prices and hurt US companies,” said Aldo Mazzaferro, a steel analyst at Macquarie.But other analysts said the rally had more to do with trading patterns than fundamentals.“Steel stocks are heavily short sold, and shorts are buying shares to cover their positions,” said David Lipschitz at Crédit Agricole Securities.Some energy stocks sat out the rally, as investors remained wary of companies carrying debt.Transocean fell 3.9 per cent to $42.76, after announcing plans to issue 29.9m new shares and raise up to $2.5bn in the corporate bond market, to refinance outstanding debt.Robin Shoemaker at Citigroup said the dilution effect could reduce earnings per share by as much as 55 cents to $3.85 in 2012.“We believe Transocean is partially financing with equity to meet near term liquidity obligations while trying to avoid losing its investment grade credit rating,” he told clients.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was up 9.5 per cent, led by Citigroup, which climbed 19.2 per cent to $28.17 and Morgan Stanley, up 17 per cent to $15.52.Hospital owners and medical device manufacturers had a tough day on Friday after Wells Fargo said Medicare carriers in 11 key states will perform pre-payment audits for inpatient hospital linked to certain cardiovascular and orthopaedic conditions from the start of the new year.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare fell 10.7 per cent on Friday to end the week up just 0.2 per cent to $4.18. Device manufacturer St Jude Medical tumbled 7 per cent, to end the week up 3 per cent to $35.83.Western Digital Corporation rose 25.8 per cent to $31.44, hitting levels not seen since flooding forced the hard disk drive manufacturer to close production facilities in Thailand more than a month ago.The company raised its current quarter revenue forecast to at least $1.8bn from a previous maximum of $1.25bn, as supply chain pressure eased.Fertiliser companies underperformed broad markets, as concerns mounted that Indian farmers will import less nutrient.Mosaic and Potash Corporation suffered losses early in the week as Indian farming co-operatives pushed for discounts on potash imports of up to 35 per cent in dollar terms, to reflect rupee weakness.Mosaic ended the week up 3.8 per cent to $51.78 and Potash Corporation up 4 per cent to $42.29.CF Industries, which supplies India with nitrogen-based fertilisers, had fared better earlier in the week, but fell Friday to close the week up just 0.7 per cent to $140.73, as reports suggested Indian orders for urea declined significantly in November compared with October."

It had been expecting a 2 per cent year-on-year rise, after it opened stores at midnight on Thanksgiving to draw in Black Friday discount hunters.Sears Holdings slumped 4.7 per cent to $57.48, on reports of weak Black Friday sales, and claims that its biggest shareholder, an investment fund linked to chairman Edward Lampert, has been selling shares.Discount department store rival Ross Stores climbed 3.6 per cent to $92.28 after year-on-year November same-store sales increased 5 per cent.“We’re still seeing year-on-year growth overall, but the holiday season is shaping up to be very competitive,” said Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.“Companies are discounting to attract traffic, while the cost of inputs like cotton and Chinese wages are rising, and that’s going to continue to eat into gross margins.”Broad US indices dipped slightly, though they held on to most of their gains from a Fed-fuelled Wednesday. The S&P 500 was off 0.2 per cent to 1,2443.59, still up more than 7 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,020.03 but still in positive territory for the year following a 500 point gain on Wednesday.The Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend and rose 0.2 per cent to 2,626.2, helped by Google. Shares in the group rose 2.4 per cent to $613.77. Google was catching up with the market after sitting out Wednesday’s rally, but was also helped by reports it would launch an online shopping service with low delivery costs to rival Amazon’s Prime. That did not stop Amazon gaining 2.6 per cent to 197.35.Fertiliser producers continued to be volatile as the weak rupee increased tension between Indian consumers and North American producers.On Thursday Indian farming co-operatives threatened to cut potash imports after a Russian producer refused to consider discounts.Mosaic shares rose as much as 3 per cent in the morning session on hopes it would resist demands to discount as well. But shares ended flat at $52.77. PotashCorp also pared early gains to close up 0.4 per cent at $43.51.CF Industries rose 5.1 per cent to $146.98, for the best performance in the S&P 500. CF is more active in the nitrogen and phosphate fertiliser markets, where Indian customers have negotiated prices that take account of the weak rupee.Shares in wireless network provider Clearwire rose as much as 25 per cent before closing up 14 per cent at $2.03. Clearwire’s main customer, Sprint Nextel agreed to extend up to $1.6bn in conditional revenues and funding to allow the company to make a $237m interest payment.Sprint initially tumbled on the arrangement, but closed flat at $2.70.Yahoo climbed 3.3 per cent to $16.23 as investors appeared to grow more confident that a $16.50 per share takeover bid led by Silver Lake Partners might end the internet portal’s long-running takeover saga.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent, more than any other sector, with investors remaining nervous about bank stocks.Citigroup fell 1.8 per cent to $26.66 and JPMorgan fell 1.7 per cent to $30.46, as they were named among five banks in a case brought by Massachusetts for foreclosure malpractice.But market watchers were struck by an overall lack of bearish sentiment.According to data from Birinyi and Associates, in the past two years a 3 per cent rally in the S&P 500 has almost invariably been followed by losses in early trading on the next trading day. “What’s interesting about this is that Wednesday’s huge moves haven’t attracted a massive wave of short selling or profit-taking,” Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, told clients.Netflix recovered from steep falls against the market on Wednesday, belatedly participating in the rally. Shares in the DVD delivery and video streaming website were up 4.1 per cent to $67.17.Lululemon Athletica fell 5.1 per cent to $47.17. The yoga and athletic clothing retailer disappointed with third-quarter results.Fibre optic maker Finisar slid 12.6 per cent to $16.12 after missing analyst estimates of earnings per share.
25;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2010-11-23T20:08:11Z;Cut-price retailers take the limelight;;"Dollar stores, hard discount supermarkets and “off price” clothing stores have long lived in the shadow of America’s top retail names.But just as Walmart supercentres and big box “category killers” such as Best Buy rose to national prominence in the 1990s, so stores such as Save-A-Lot, Big Lots and Dollar General are becoming the new stars of a rapidly changing retail environment.“I do believe that there is a new consumerism,” says Rick Dreiling, chief executive of Dollar General, which operates more than 9,100 small hard discount general stores in 35 US states. “People are conscious about saving money.”At a time when mainstream retailers have slowed growth in the long months of the recession, or stopped it altogether, the value-focused retailers have continued to expand.By the end of this year the three leading “dollar store” chains – Dollar General, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree – will have opened about 1,000 new locations this year, with an annual square footage growth rate of 5 per cent that exceeds Walmart, Target and Kmart, their far larger rivals whose growth rates are either flat or below 3 per cent.TJX Companies and Ross Stores too, “off-price” stores that sell seasonal leftovers and end of line brands, have maintained their pre-recession annual growth rates, sometimes moving into retail spaces vacated by bankrupted businesses including Circuit City, the electronics business, and Mervyn’s, the west coast department store chain.“Hard discount” grocers, which offer a highly limited selection of foods dominated by their own private label brands, are also far outstripping the rest of the supermarket business.The US unit of Aldi, the hard discount grocer, plans to expand this year at just under 10 per cent a year, adding another 100 stores to its 1,100 strong chain. Save-A-Lot, a US hard discount supermarket owned by Supervalu, is growing at a similar rate, but wants to double its store network to 2,400 stores by 2015. On the West Coast, the UK’s Tesco has continued to open up more locations for its fledgling Fresh & Easy stores, also a hard discount format.Bill Shaner, Save-A-Lot’s chief executive, says his company’s ambitious expansion plans reflect the view that it is “perfectly positioned in today’s economy”, with an Aldi-like high percentage of private label food goods, and stores with low overheads stocking a limited collection of about 1,800 product lines, including fresh items. This compares with a supermarket industry average of 48,750 product lines, according to the Food Marketing Institute.Executives at all three types of store claim they are managing to hold on to customers they acquired during the recession, and are continuing to see sales growth. Both Dollar General and Family Dollar have been remodelling stores and revamping their own label food brands, in a bid to change perceptions of what to expect in their aisles.Mr Shaner says that the Save-A-Lot stores, which are aimed at households earning less than $45,000, “are seeing new faces”.“I think that is really our opportunity, to communicate a great shopping experience …so that we do manage to keep them when the economy does get stronger.”Dollar General’s Mr Dreiling says the recession sales success of the dollar stores has also helped change perceptions among suppliers, who may initially have been loath to see their brands on the shelves of a dollar store. “When we started our journey there were a lot of people who were looking at us and raising an eyebrow,” he says of the days after the company went private in 2007.But that changed as the recession gathered momentum in early 2008, “when we began to seriously start clocking some serious sales growth”.“Tell me another retailer that’s in a mature channel in a mature business that has basically raised their average store sales volume by 25 per cent over 3 years.”US hard discount grocery sales have room for more growth, currently accounting for less than 2 per cent of total national grocery sales; in Europe market penetration for the same segment ranges from the high teens to about 44 per cent in Germany.Todd Hale, head of retail and shopper insights at Nielsen, the consumer research company, includes the growth of low-cost grocery stores as one of his predictions for changes in the retail landscape by 2015. “Consumers have fundamentally changed their habits,” he said recently.Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree chief executive, says that his chain is “positioned squarely in the cross hairs of what consumers are looking for today”, combining both low costs and accessible local stores. “Middle America is seeking value, and we are the destination.”"
26;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2010-11-23T20:07:43Z;Low-cost stores expand as bigger shops falter;;TJ Maxx has opened its third store in Manhattan on 57th Street – with the “off-price” retailer moving into space previously occupied by a branch of Gap, the leading US speciality clothing retailer.Marshalls, another off-price retailer owned by TJ Maxx’s parent company, TJX, is opening an outlet in the city’s Chelsea district, selling a similar selection of end-of-range mid-price and aspirational branded merchandise.Nearby on Union Square stands the recently opened Nordstrom Rack store, operated by the upmarket Nordstrom department store to dispose of out-of-season or excess clothing stock.For once, Manhattan’s retail changes are accurately reflecting changes in the country as a whole – with TJX and its rivals continuing to open stores at pre-recession rates, as mainstream rivals pause or slow expansion.Over the past two years, the largest off-price retailers – TJX and Ross Stores – have regularly reported sales growth outperforming conventional department stores, with comparable sales gains running in the mid-single digits. Their stores, known for their overflowing racks and discounts of up to 60 per cent, were prime beneficiaries of shoppers abandoning traditional department stores to “trade down” by searching for brand-name bargains.But both claim they can continue to expand even as the economy improves, benefiting from changed shopping habits among customers across all income levels.Michael O’Sullivan, Ross’s chief operating officer, has told investors that from experience of past downturns, “when we pick up new customers …we tend to hold on to [them] even when the economy picks up”.The two groups also argue that their established position in the stock liquidation business – which accounts for about 7 per cent of US clothing sales – will help them stave off competition from online competitors such as Ebay and Overstock.com.Laura Champine, retail analyst at Cowan & Co, says the scale of purchases by the largest off-price retailers – who buy with short lead times of four to six weeks – gives them the market power that should guarantee them adequate supplies of excess branded merchandise even in a recovering economy.“A vendor who does not sell to them runs the risk of not being able to move excess inventory,” she says.TJX, which also operates the TK Maxx stores in Europe, has 2,799 stores, and had sales of more than $20bn last year. Ross Stores, with more than 1,030 stores in the US and sales of $7.2bn, has hopes of eventually doubling the number of its US locations.
27;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2010-08-05T22:52:25Z;US store sales data give subdued picture;;US chain retailers’ July sales reflected the fitful nature of the recovery, with data released on Thursday showing pockets of strength offset by an overall picture of subdued demand.Several stores that hold the middle ground in the US retail landscape did well, with Macy’s, the largest US department store by revenues, reporting a 7.3 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year. Limited, whose store brands include Victoria’s Secret, saw same-store sales rise 7 per cent and raised guidance for the second quarter, as did Kohl’s, a mid-cost department store, whose sales rose 4.6 per cent.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, said its same-store sales rose 1 per cent, with continued strength at its lower-cost Old Navy stores, and growth at Banana Republic. But sales at its Gap brand stores fell 6 per cent. Gap also raised earnings guidance for the quarter.JC Penney, a mid-price department store, reported its comparable sales fell 0.6 per cent.Dillards and Bon-Ton, two regional department store chains, reported comparable sales falls.Saks, the luxury department store, said comparable sales rose 6.4 per cent, while its rival Nordstrom reported 7.6 per cent growth.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly data, said its index of same-store sales rose 3 per cent, missing the 3.2 per cent forecast based on Wall Street analysts’ views. The index was pulled down by weakness at teen and youth retailers.TJX and Ross Stores, which sell remaindered and excess branded clothing, also saw sluggish sales growth of 2 per cent, after seeing much stronger growth from bargain-hunting shoppers during the recession.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that the subdued overall picture came despite stepped up discounting and promotions by retailers.
28;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2010-06-04T01:00:57Z;US store recovery slows in May;;The gradual recovery in US shoppers’ discretionary spending showed signs of slowing in May, according to monthly sales data from leading chain retailers released on Thursday.But several leading retailers suggested that bad weather in the first part of the month, and a shift in the timing of Memorial Day holiday shopping, may have affected spending more than continuing macroeconomic concerns.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly data, said its index of same-store sales rose 2.7 per cent against the same period last year, 130 basis points below initial expectations.Mr Perkins said the data suggested that consumers had “pulled back the reins on what looked like a fledgling spending recovery in the first quarter”.But the monthly figures were also affected by the timing of the Memorial Day holiday, which pushed sales from the last Sunday and Monday of the month into the retailers’ June reporting period.Sales of summer clothing were also affected by unseasonably wet and cool weather during the first half of the month.Frank Badillo, senior economist at Kantar Retail, argued that the “results provide some sign that the retail recovery will persist” in spite of wealth declines and economic uncertainties.Monthly sales at Target, the discounter whose performance has become a bellwether of broad consumer sentiment, increased 1.3 per cent against a year ago.Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said in a statement that the retailer’s “recent experience reinforces our belief that we will continue to experience volatility in the pace of economic recovery”.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain by sales, which reported a 1.4 per cent increase in comparable sales, cited the impact of the weather, saying its “business trend strengthened toward the end of the month as the weather turned warmer”.Kohl’s, the lower price department store, noted that business improved during the last week of the month, with its comparable sales up 3.5 per cent, better than it had expected.Neiman Marcus, Saks and Nordstrom, the luxury and high-end department stores also continued to provide evidence of the recovery in spending by better off consumers.Neiman Marcus said same store sales rose 7.8 per cent, and noted that its store sales growth was led by its locations in New York City and Texas. Saks comparable sales were up 5.8 per cent, and Nordstrom’s were up 3.7 per cent, with slower growth due to the later start of an annual half-year sale.Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, reported comparable sales growth of 1 per cent, with only its North America Gap brand stores seeing a sales decline, by 2 per cent.Discount retailers also continued to outperform their full price competition, with TJX and Ross Stores, which sell remaindered and excess branded goods, reporting same store sales growth of 4 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.Despite the continued sales growth seen by most retailers, their overall sales remain below levels seen in 2007 and the first part of 2008.
29;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2010-05-20T20:47:28Z;S&P 500 falls most since April 2009;;"A jump in jobless claims and continuing European debt jitters drove US markets sharply lower, sending the S&P 500 to its sharpest drop in 13 months, and more than 10 per cent below last month’s high.At close in New York, the S&P 500 index was down 3.9 per cent to 1,071.59, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.6 per cent to 10,068.01 and the Nasdaq Composite index lost 4.1 per cent to 2,204.01.With yesterday’s declines, US indices joined other global markets in posting losses for the year – but the US benchmarks are still outperforming many of them.Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global, said this month’s intraday lows were significant indicators to watch, such as 1,065.79 for the S&P 500.If the main indices were to fall past these levels “[it] would be a problematic development” he said.As stocks fell, the Vix, a widely watched measure of volatility, surged 26 per cent to 44.38, the highest level for more than a year.The US labour department said initial claims for unemployment benefits on a weekly basis rose 25,000 to 471,000, seasonally adjusted, for the week ending May 15, highest since early April.“The theme of breaking no new ground on the lay-off front continues,” said Jonathan Basile, vice-president for economics at Credit Suisse.Materials and industrials led the market declines.Alcoa, the global metals group, fell 6 per cent to $11.07. Caterpillar, a manufacturer of construction equipment, lost 4.5 per cent to $58.67.General Electric’s shares lost 5.8 per cent to $16.26. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries filed a US antitrust lawsuit against GE over patents related to wind turbines.Leading banks also slipped. The US Senate, in a party-line vote, sent the financial reform package to a final vote. Citigroup was down 4.7 per cent to $3.63 and Bank of America lost 6.3 per cent to $15.28.Jonathan Golub, chief equity strategist at UBS, said investors would be watching banking shares as credit risk indicators to determine whether conditions had bottomed out.“Markets have become increasingly concerned about the sufficiency of measures taken to defend the euro as well as the impact of proposed austerity plans,” said Mr Golub.Harman International, an audio equipment maker that receives nearly three-quarters of its revenues in Europe, slipped another 3.7 per cent to $30.56.Net income for Autodesk, the design software maker, jumped 11 per cent in its first quarter over the same period last year, beating analyst expectations.But the group, which said it sold more software overseas, also warned those gains could be fleeting. Shares fell back 6.9 per cent to $28.28.“[Our] enthusiasm is tempered somewhat by the devaluation of the euro and the general instability of the European economy,” said Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive.VeriSign, an internet software provider, lost 1.5 per cent to $27.56 after agreeing to sell its security unit to Symantec for $1.3bn. Symantec fell back 5.6 per cent to $14.76.Advance Auto Parts shares were 6.9 per cent higher at $48.99 after Credit Suisse raised its price target to $55, citing an economic backdrop in which more drivers would be servicing their own cars, as well as the group’s ability to provide “customer service focus, direct sourcing and price optimisation”.Sears said its earnings fell 39 per cent in the first quarter year-on-year, which the retailer attributed to declining margins in appliances and other big-ticket items. Its shares plummeted 11 per cent to $88.70.Drugstore chain Walgreens lost 6 per cent to $32.71, after analysts at Credit Suisse downgraded it from “outperform” to “neutral”.Ross Stores was 1.1 per cent higher, to $52.28, after it reported higher-than-

30;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2010-05-06T16:47:47Z;US same-store sales disappoint;;US retailers on Thursday reported April same-store sales below expectations, but which overall confirmed an ongoing rebound in consumer spending.Sales rose 0.5 per cent in April at stores open for more than a year, according to a Thomson Reuters compilation of figures, short of the estimate of 1.7 per cent growth.The disappointment was not a surprise, due to poor weather in April and a shift of spending toward March because of an early Easter holiday.Discount general retailer Costco reported an 11 per cent gain, due in part to higher fuel prices, but missed expectations of a 11.2 per cent rise.“The bounce in the business that began last summer seems to be cooling as demand is satiated for televisions, and consumers ever so lightly migrate back to the likes of Target and specialty retailers given improved economic conditions,” said Brian Sozzi, of forecasting firm Wall Street Strategies.Target sales dropped 5.9 per cent in April, versus a forecast of a 2.3 per cent drop. But it also reported that a combined March-April rise of 3 per cent was its best sales jump in two years.Speciality were hit hard. Gap sales fell 3 per cent, while they had been expected to grow 1 per cent. Abercrombie & Fitch sales fell 8 per cent in April, well past its 2 per cent forecasted decline.Off-price clothing stores reported higher sales, though they also missed forecasts. Ross Stores reported a 3 per cent jump, and TJX rose 4 per cent.A few stores did exceed expectations, notably higher-end retailers. Nordstrom jumped 7.5 per cent, versus a 6.5 per cent forecast. Limited Brands reported a 4 per cent rise against expected flat growth.The rise in sales matches an uptick in consumption generally. First quarter US consumer spending rose 0.6 per cent, and personal consumption represented 2.6 percentage points of the first-quarter GDP growth figure of 3.2 per cent.“The trend is still upwards, but it’s not going to be a smooth ride,” said Julia Coronado, senior US economist at BNP Paribas. “There will be less government support for incomes going forward, but we are starting to see the labour market turn the corner.”The US is expected to have added jobs again in April, which would provide support for shoppers. The forecast is that Friday’s non-farm payroll figures will show growth of 189,000 jobs.
31;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2010-04-08T21:01:13Z;US retailers enjoy spring sales rebound;;US retailers reported their best year-on-year monthly sales gains for several years on Thursday as Easter holiday purchases and renewed discretionary spending helped sales bounce back from last year’s slump.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its same store sales index rose 8.7 per cent for March, the largest monthly increase since it began tracking the data in 2000.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that the strong performance was supported both by the early Easter and the easy comparisons with last year, when the index fell 4.8 per cent. But he also saw signs of improving consumer confidence.“Consumers are generally feeling better about their plight and are finally making discretionary purchases and beginning to trade back up a bit,” he said.The strong monthly sales led a handful of large retailers, including Target, the discounter, and Kohl’s and JC Penney, the mid-price department stores, to raise their quarterly earnings guidance.At the top end of the retail market, Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department stores, both reported strong increases in comparable sales from last year’s lows, of 12.7 per cent and 9.6 per cent, respectively. Their rival Nordstrom reported a 16.8 per cent increase.Meanwhile, Macy’s, the largest department store, saw a 10.8 per cent lift, while JC Penney reported a 5.4 per cent increase and Kohl’s reported a 22.5 per cent increase in same store sales.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, continued its sales recovery, with an 11 per cent increase in comparable sales, with double digit increases across its US Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores. Teen retailers American Eagle, Aeropostale and Zumiez also reported double digit comparable sales gains, although Abercrombie & Fitch delivered a more subdued 5 per cent rise.Target, the mass discounter, also reported a strong recovery in sales, which were up 10.3 per cent on a comparable basis. Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, said the performance “exceeded our expectations, driven by particular strength in our apparel business”.Target’s larger rival Walmart does not report monthly sales numbers.At the lower end of the spectrum, TJX and Ross Stores, which focus on selling remaindered clothing brands, continued the sales growth that saw them outperform full-price rivals over the past year, with 12 and 14 per cent comparable sales increases.John Long, retail analyst at Kurt Salmon Associates, cautioned that, in spite of the strong March performance, consumers were still facing challenges. “We have already seen an uptick in consumer confidence but it is not necessarily something that we believe may be able to be sustained, given the macro-economic story,” he said.
32;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2009-12-03T16:09:34Z;US retailers report tough November;;Leading US retailers reported November sales that were broadly lower than expected, as a post-Thanksgiving rush failed to offset earlier weak demand.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly comparable sales figures, said its index for the month rose just 0.7 per cent from last year, when sales slumped. Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said the “the bottom line is that comp store sales were very disappointing ahead of the critical December holiday shopping season”.“The standard line from many retailers was a stronger year-on-year Black Friday [post-Thanksgiving] weekend was not enough to offset very weak sales throughout most of the month.”JC Penney, the low price department store, reported a 5.9 per cent fall in its comparable sales, in line with its forecast of a drop of 4 to 7 per cent, but on top of last November’s 11.9 per cent decline.“Strong sales for the Black Friday weekend offset slightly weaker sales beginning mid-month and leading up to Thanksgiving,” the company said.Kohl’s reported a 3 per cent increase in comparable sales, while Macy’s, the largest US traditional department store chain, reported a 6.1 per cent fall in comparable sales. Macy’s said its post Thanksgiving sales had been “below expectations”, which it attributed to competing sales promotions, and also highlighted the impact of the unseasonably warm weather on winter clothes sales.Target, the second largest discounter, said its comparable November sales were down 1.5 per cent against last November, with softer sales in the first three weeks “substantially offset by better-than-expected sales during our post-Thanksgiving Two-Day sale”.The retailer said it has seen strong sales of consumer electronics, toys and apparel, as well as household goods, small appliances and beauty. It also said that while overall sales levels had decreased, the number of transactions had increased.Walmart, the largest US retailer and Target’s rival, does not report monthly same store sales.Costco, the discount warehouse club that has been one of the beneficiaries of households seeking to cut spending, reported flat comparable sales at its US stores. The company noted that its top line sales were affected by lower food prices and by continuing deflation in flat screen TV pricing, where unit sales were up 15 per cent, while dollar sales saw a mid single digit percentage declines.Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen retailer, reported a 17 per cent fall in comparable sales, far worse than analysts’ expected. Aeropostale sales were slightly worse than expected, with a 7 percent rise, and its shares fell over 10 per cent in New York after its quarterly earnings forecast disappointed market analysts.Low price and discount retailers continued to outperform full price rivals, with both Ross Stores and TJX Companies reporting comparable sales up 8 per cent.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, reported overall comparable sales that were flat, but saw a 6 per cent increase at its low price Old Navy stores, offsetting comparable 4 per cent declines at its US Gap and Banana Republic stores, and a 5 per cent decline in its international business.Luxury retailers Neiman Marcus and Saks reported comparable sales declines of 7.5 per cent and 26.1 per cent, on top of the declines of around 30 per cent seen in November and December last year in the aftermath of the Wall Street crash. Saks said it still expected comparable store sales for the fourth quarter to be down in the high-single digits.
33;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2009-11-05T16:26:28Z;US shoppers still cautious in October;;US chain retailers’ October sales figures on Thursday underlined shoppers’ cautious mood, with many mainstream retailers still seeing flat or declining sales against the lows seen a year ago.Macy’s, the largest US department store, reported comparable sales at stores open at least a year that were only slightly down from October 2008, decreasing 0.8 per cent. Target, the discounter, also reported sales slightly down at 0.1 per cent, with Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, describing the performance as “slightly better than our expectation”.But sales at JC Penney, the mid-range department store with around 1,000 locations, decreased 4.5 per cent. The company said it had seen better-than-expected sales during the first half of the month, but that sales “turned softer and were below expectations in the final week”. Its rival Kohl’s reported a 1.4 per cent increase in same-store sales, missing Wall Street’s forecast of a gain of almost 5 per cent.Teen retailers also continued to struggle. Abercrombie & Fitch saw its comparable sales fall 15 per cent, and American Apparel saw a 6 per cent drop. Aeropostale reported a positive 3 per cent, but far below the 14 per cent gain expected by Wall Street.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, delivered a positive surprise, reporting a 4 per cent increase that marked its first company-wide comparable-sales increase for two-and-a-half years.Gap’s improvement came against the 16 per cent fall in same-store sales it saw last October, underlining the fact that most full-price retailers are still seeing sales subsantially below pre-crash levels.More well-heeled customers also showed some readiness to spend. Nordstrom, the fashion department store, reported a 6 per cent increase in same-store sales, while Saks saw a 0.7 per cent increase - against last October’s 16.6 per cent fall.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales data, said its index of comparable-store sales rose 2.2 per cent, a second consecutive monthly increase.The index was boosted by continuing stength of off-price retailers TJ Maxx and Ross Stores, which reported same-store sales gains of 10 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, continuing to benefit from consumers’ frugal focus.A monthly survey of consumer confidence released on Thursday by RBC also highlighted a mood of continuing caution. RBC’s consumer attitudes and spending by household index fell to 30.5, down 21.6 points from October’s 51.8 reading. The group described the fall as “the sharpest one-month drop in consumer sentiment since last autumn’s financial crisis”, and cited factors including unemployment concerns.“Although we have pulled back from the abyss, consumer attitudes remain susceptible to negative news,” said Ira Jersey, head of US interest rate strategy for RBC Capital Markets.
34;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2009-10-08T19:36:47Z;US retailers in first gain since 2008 crisis;;Leading US retailers on Thursday reported their first monthly sales gain since the financial collapse of September 2008, although most still saw lower sales than a year ago as shoppers remained focused on bargain hunting.The 1.1 per cent rise in Retail Metrics’ September comparable sales index emerged as the Department of Labor reported that the number of workers claiming jobless benefits fell last week to the lowest level this year.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, attributed the comparable sales gain in September – the first increase since August 2008 – to stronger autumn fashions and promotions, and comparisons with a year ago when sales plunged. But he warned: “We would not interpret this month’s results as a sign the consumer is back.”The monthly sales figures were supported by a later Labor Day weekend, which shifted some back-to-school sales into September from August.The figures showed shoppers continuing to favour lower-price retailers as they face uncertainties over unemployment and tighter credit. For example, Gap’s Old Navy low-price chain reported a 13 per cent surge in comparable sales, while overall same-store sales fell 8 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, at its more upscale Gap and Banana Republic stores.Comparable sales also rose 5.5 per cent at Kohl’s, the low-price department store, and by 7 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively, at TJX and Ross Stores, which focus on remaindered brands.By contrast, Saks and Neiman Marcus, the upmarket department stores, underlined the comparative weakness of US luxury demand, with comparable sales down 11.6 per cent and 16.9 per cent, respectively.Sales at Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, fell 2.4 per cent, while Target, the mass discounter, reported a 1.2 per cent decline. Walmart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports comparable sales on a monthly basis.Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said the retailer “remained cautious” about the fourth quarter, despite the stronger-than-expected September. The National Retail Federation has warned that total US retail sales excluding gasoline and restaurants in November and December will fall by 1 per cent to the levels last seen four years ago.
35;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
36;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2009-08-06T19:04:37Z;US stores suffer gloomy July;;Leading US retailers had another month of year-on-year comparable sales declines in July, and several said they managed to maintain or improve profit margins on leaner inventory levels and reduced price markdowns.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly same-store sales, said on Thursday its index for July was down 4.7 per cent against the period last year. The index excludes Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, which no longer reports monthly sales numbers.Consumer concern over rising unemployment and the economy hit sales, but other factors were the later start to the back-to-school shopping season than last year and the fact that several states moved annual sales-tax-free shopping days to August.Only a handful of retailers reported comparable sales gains, including the “off-price” stores TJX and Ross. Off-price stores, which buy excess stock from other brands, have performed well throughout the recession.Kohl’s, which operates more than 1,000 discount-style department stores, also reported a 0.4 per cent increase in same-store sales, its first gain since April last year. Its rival JC Penney said its comparable sales fell 12.3 per cent, while Target, the discounter, reported a 6.5 per cent drop, and Macy’s was down 10.7 per cent.Costco, the warehouse club, reported a 2 per cent fall in comparable sales at its US stores, excluding petrol, as lower prices for food and large electronics items including televisions offset continued gains in transactions. Costco’s unit sales of TVs were up 30 per cent on July last year.Luxury retailers continued to struggle during the month, with Neiman Marcus and Saks department stores reporting comparable sales down 27 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.Several retailers reported strongest sales in the southwest and north-east of the US but continued weakness in Florida, the south-east and in the Midwest. Kohl’s said its stores in the south-west had recorded double-digit sales gains in comparable stores.In spite of the overall sluggishness, several retailers raised conservative earnings estimates, including Gap, Macy’s, JC Penney and Kohl’s.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said retailers’ attention was focused on the back-to-school selling surge, from the end of August and to the first week of September.“I think inventories are going to be lean, and they could leave some sales on the table as a result …But if I were them, I would take that bet,” he said, noting that in July sales “remained in a rut”.
37;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2009-07-09T20:02:16Z;US retail sales;;"However loud the pounding of rain on the roof, climate change cannot be judged by the weight of a single deluge. So one month’s worth of retail sales figures, particularly without the contribution of America’s largest retailer Wal-Mart, is of only limited use. A wet first half, followed by a dry fortnight, added the weather’s own twist to shoppers’ behaviour in June. The comparison against last year is skewed by the lack of government stimulus cheques landing in post boxes this summer. But it is possible to divine some broader retail trends in the wind.On the plus side, conditions could actually be worse. Overall retail sales dropped 4.3 per cent year on year, according to consultancy Retail Metrics, less than had been feared. Retailers have also managed inventory levels better this year, resulting in fewer markdowns and improving margins.Yet high unemployment and stagnant wages mean consumers are still trading down to discount retailers. Cut price clothes stores Ross and TJ Maxx were among the few to expand sales. Discretionary spending is out, with department stores still suffering. Even with a burst of discounting, Saks’ sales for May and June combined were still down 15 per cent on last year.Indeed, the big risk for retailers is that expectations for ever lower prices become entrenched. Abercrombie & Fitch, which resists price competition, saw sales drop by a third in June, while well-timed promotions pushed turnover up 12 per cent at Aeropostale. By September, stores will be lapping the declines of last year, so sales should at least level off. But better inventory management also means fewer clearance bargains to tempt shoppers through the doors. If the back-to-school season fails to generate interest, more storm-proofing will be in order.Leading US retailers offered a mixed bag of monthly sales figures on Thursday, as consumers continued to curb spending in June while bad weather in the northeast US weighed on sales of summer merchandise. Year-to-year comparisons for June were also skewed by the impact last year of the boost to spending from federal tax rebate cheques.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of same store sales fell 4.3 per cent for the month, slightly better than expected as several stores exceeded Wall Street’s forecasts.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said June had been “setting up to be particularly disastrous. It actually turned out to be weak, but not as bad as expected”.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

38;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2009-05-08T00:02:08Z;US retailers have cause to raise earnings call;;More than a dozen US retailers raised their earnings guidance on Thursday, after releasing April sales data that showed battered US shoppers displaying renewed interest in purchases of clothing and other discretionary items, while continuing to frequent low-cost stores.Companies raising guidance included the three largest US department store chains – JC Penney, Kohl’s and Macy’s – as well as Target, the mass discounter.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales numbers, said its overall index for April showed a 1.5 per cent increase, supported in part by sales around Easter, which fell in March last year.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics said the figures were better than expected and had been “aided by rising consumer confidence from improving market performance” as well as extra cash from lower tax payments and mortgage refinancing.Janet Hoffman, managing partner of Accenture’s North American retail practice, said “the overall picture is for a baby step towards [a] positive [environment]”.“I think we are definitely on the path towards moving out of the depth of the underperformance in consumer-facing retail,” she said.In a sign of resilience in the middle of the market, JC Penney said its strongest performing divisions had been women’s and children’s clothing, although overall comparable sales, against last April, were still down 6.6 per cent. Kohl’s, with comparable sales down 6.2 per cent, also reported strong children’s clothing sales as it raised its earnings guidance by over 10 cents a share.Target said its same-store sales increased by 0.3 per cent, adding that it had been able to avoid price-cutting and had seen better-than-expected profit margins. The retailer said it expected its first-quarter earnings to be “well above” the current $0.52 per share forecast by Wall Street.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, continued to benefit from budget-focused shoppers, reporting a stronger-than-expected 5 per cent increase in comparable store sales and gains in customer traffic. The company, which also announced that it would no longer issue monthly comparable sales data, said last week it had seen renewed strength in discretionary spending.Other low price retailers continued to fare well, including Dollar Tree, Ross and TJX. But luxury department stores Saks and Neiman Marcus continued to struggle.
39;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2009-04-09T15:23:05Z;US retailers see some signs of demand;;March sales figures from leading US retailers provided some shimmers of light amid the prevailing gloom, with a number of store chains reporting signs of an increased readiness to spend by still-cautious consumers.The months comparable sales figures were affected by the shift in the timing of Easter, which drives gift and clothing sales, from March to April this year. The monthly data from store chains can also reflect specific marketing and merchandising, rather than broader economic trends.But the March sales data offered some signs that middle-class shoppers, who snapped their wallets shut in the fourth quarter of last year, may be starting to resume cautious spending.JC Penney, the US department store focused on middle class consumers, said it had seen “a positive response” in women’s clothing and in its home business” as it reported a better-than-expected 7.6 per cent fall in sales at stores open at least a year. The retailer had forecast a low-double digit to mid-teen drop.The retailer raised its forecast for first quarter earnings, which will include a 23 cent pension costs non-cash charge, seeing a loss of 5 to 10 cents against a previous estimate of a 20 to 30 cent loss.Its rival Kohls reported a 4.3 per cent fall in same store sales. Kevin Mansell, chief executive, said the results “exceeded our expectations” and that home furnishing sales had also been its strongest business.Target, the discounter that is also heavily dependent on clothing and home sales, said it had “begun to see encouraging signs” in the operating results of both its stores and its credit card business. The retailer reported a 6 per cent drop in comparable March sales, but said it expected April sales to be essentially flat, due to the Easter shift.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, reported that comparable sales at its Supercenters and discount stores increased just 0.6 per cent, below Wall Street’s expectations. Including its Sam’s Club warehouses, which saw a 6 per cent increase, the retailer’s overall US same store sales rose by 1.4 per cent.But it said it expected its first quarter earnings to come in at the higher end of the 72 to 77 cents per share it forecast in February.Wal-Mart also reported the sixth consecutive month of increases in customer traffic. It said average transactions were lower, which it attributed to the Easter shift, and to moderating price rises in its grocery sales.The retailer said sales were again driven by grocery and pharmacy sales, but said that its home and “do-it-yourself” categories had seen mid-single digit comparable store sales gains.Luxury retailers continued to struggle during the month, with Neiman Marcus and Saks reporting comparables sales falls of 29.9 per cent and 23.6 per cent. Both reported weakness across all their merchandise categories.Elsewhere, Gap reported an 8 per cent fall in comparable sales, but said it had stopped the sales decline during the month at its troubled Old Navy division. Gap brand US sales were down 14 per cent, and Banana Republic fell 16 per cent. But the retailer said it had achieved profit margins above those seen last year.Despite the outbreaks of optimism, overall March sales fell by more than Wall Street expected. Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index fell 1.6 per cent, against the 0.6 per cent fall it had been expecting. But it also noted that several retailers including Hot Topic, American Eagle and Cache, the fashion retailers, as well as “off price” discounters TJX and Ross Stores had raised first quarter earnings guidance.

Its shares closed in New York on Tuesday at $44.58.The retailer, founded in 1972, broadened beyond its initial focus on coats into baby goods, home furnishings and shoes. Its competitors include TJ Maxx and Ross Stores, both considerably larger. Goody’s Family Clothing, a smaller rival, announced a deal in December to sell itself to private equity investors GMM Capital and Prentice Capital for $312m.Burlington, with 60 per cent of shares controlled by the Milstein family, appointed Goldman Sachs to explore a sale last year. Mr Milstein is in his late 70s with two sons on the board.Jordan Hitch, a managing director at Bain, said the company had “good growth prospects” and new management would continue to expand its store network.Recent private equity buy- outs in the retail sector have included the $1.3bn acquisition of Linens ‘N’ Things by Apollo Management. A consortium led by Cerberus Capital narrowly failed to agree a $9.6bn deal for Albertson’s, the leading supermarket chain. Private equity investors are also considering a possible buy-out of Borders Group, the books and music retailer.Howard Davidowitz, president of Davidowitz & Associates, a retail consulting and investment banking firm, said Bain had paid “top dollar” for the company, and questioned its prospects for investing in growth and improvements to its store network following an expected increase in debt linked to the deal.
41;ROST;Ross Stores Inc;2004-09-03T16:23:27Z;Wall St shrugs off bad news in a quiet week;;Wall Street took some disappointing corporate news in its stride this week, with the weaker oil price tipping the balance in favour of the bulls.There was also relief that the summer's final “big event” the Republican National Convention in New York had passed without a terrorist attack.But it was the last week of the summer and activity was muted, in part because many investors and traders went on holiday to avoid the Republican gathering.But while markets were up over the week, they dipped on Friday amid disappointment over a warning from Intel late on Thursday and because solid job creation figures suggested the Federal Reserve was likely to raise interest rates again later this month.By the close, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 10,260.20. However, the benchmark index was still up 0.6 per cent on the week. The S&P 500 had slipped 0.4 per cent to 1,113.63 on Friday, but it made a 0.5 per cent gain on the week.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.6 per cent to 1,844.48, for a 0.9 per cent weekly loss.Several strategists said the week's gains should be taken with a pinch of salt, because volumes were paper-thin.The week's economic data were largely tepid. August retail sales were extremely disappointing, with the much-anticipated back-to-school season stirring only modest interest in consumers.The data front took a turn for the better on Friday, with the eagerly awaited August non-farm payroll figures coming in at 144,000 just shy of analysts' expectations of 150,000 new jobs. But June and July figures were revised upwards by a combined 59,000.Although the figures suggest growth is more robust than feared, investors seemed to focus more on the implications for further interest rate rises.The closely watched mid-quarter update from Intel, the technology bellwether, was more than disappointing. The company said demand was weaker than expected and cut its forecasts for third quarter revenues and profit margins. Shares skidded 7.3 per cent yesterday to $20.05, making a new 52-week low and dragging down much of the chip sector with it. Semiconductors scored the week's worst performance on the S&P 500, down 7.2 per cent.Other losers included Advanced Micro Devices, off 6.6 per cent to $10.90 by the close, Xilinx, down 6.1 per cent to $25.59, PMC-Sierra, down 6.9 per cent to $8.69 and Applied Micro Circuits, 4.3 per cent weaker at $3.15.Intel's warning was only one of Thursday's disappointments. Wal-Mart, the retail giant, reported its weakest August sales in four years on the same day.Nonetheless, shares in the world's biggest retailer gained 0.7 per cent to $53.02 on the day, as investors were relieved that the 0.5 per cent same-store sales increase was not smaller.Gap, the clothing retailer, also reported a slimmer-than-expected drop in August sales.

Winners included Transocean, up 7.6 per cent on the week, Noble 7.9 per cent stronger and Occidental Petroleum, up 5 per cent.Woody Dorsey, a technical analyst at Market Semiotics, said investors' thinking about energy stocks had begun to shift, as they come round to the idea that oil prices may stay relatively high for some time.Although energy stocks have notched the S&P 500's best performance of the year, up 16.9 per cent, they have not kept pace with the soaring price of crude oil.
