While the list does not embargo dealings with these entities, it requires US companies to treat them with caution. US suppliers can no longer use existing licences to sell them products or to service installed equipment, but must reapply for new ones. San’an Optoelectronics is also the world’s biggest LED chipmaker by revenue and is listed in Shanghai.Xi’an Jiaotong University, one of China’s top 15 universities and a unit of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the country’s top research agency, is another Applied Materials customer named on the list, which was published on April 11, according to a supply chain source familiar with the situation. Some 37 Chinese companies and research institutions were named on the list, as well as seven organisations in Hong Kong, four in the United Arab Emirates, two in Malaysia and one in Indonesia.The US government’s move marks another setback to companies and research institutions that are crucial to China’s ambitions to become a global tech superpower.Applied Materials supplies almost all the world’s leading semiconductor and panel manufacturers. Market leaders such as Intel, Samsung Electronics, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and China’s national display champion BOE Technology Group could not make their products without the company’s tools and services.This article is from the Nikkei Asian Review, a global publication with a uniquely Asian perspective on politics, the economy, business and international affairs. Our own correspondents and outside commentators from around the world share their views on Asia, while our Asia300 section provides in-depth coverage of 300 of the biggest and fastest-growing listed companies from 11 economies outside Japan.Subscribe | Group subscriptionsAs an industry leader in advanced tools for the critical semiconductor industry, Applied Materials’ decision to immediately stop all business with those on the list could influence other US vendors, as well as others outside the country, industry sources told Nikkei.On April 12, Applied Materials sent a notice, obtained by Nikkei, to all staff involved with the named companies telling them to “immediately stop all pending and future equipment delivery, and cease all service activities at their sites”. It also demanded that staff, contractors and other personnel immediately leave the sites of those companies.It warned that failure to follow its instructions could lead to significant violations of US trade law.The company’s actions come just weeks after Gary Dickerson, chief executive of Applied Materials, travelled to China in late March to attend SEMICON China, one of the industry’s biggest events and an important showcase for Chinese technology since Beijing made development of the chip industry a top policy priority in 2014.At the event, Mr Dickerson made his first clear and public statement about the US-China trade tensions that have hit the chip industry hard. “The strained relationship between China and the US can put decades of economic growth at risk,” he said. He also warned it would be “a lose-lose proposition” if the world’s two biggest economic powers were unable to get along.Applied Materials generated some 26 per cent of its revenue from China, its biggest market, in the most recent quarter ending January 27. The US company did not immediately respond to a request for comments. San’an also did not respond to a request for comments.Gao Feng, China’s commerce ministry spokesman, hit back at the new unverified list, saying the US move could damage the reputations of Chinese companies and disrupt normal trade activities. Beijing said it objected to the abuse of national security and export control rules and demanded that the US withdraw the new curbs as soon as possible.Akin Gump, an international law firm, warned companies in a research note that they would have to respond to the requirements of the unverified list. “As a result of this development, US and non-US companies and others should update their internal control program screens to ensure compliance with the new requirements,” the note said.Harry Clark, a partner with law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in Washington, told Nikkei that being added to the unverified list did not mean a broad ban on US exports and re-exports to a named entity, but companies would need to obtain extra licences and file additional reports if dealing with such entities. It also applied to foreign persons.“My firm advises clients to be especially careful to ensure that any export or re-export involving an unverified list entity is scrupulously compliant with the regulation,” Mr Clark said.Nikkei staff writer Lauly Li contributed to this report.A version of this article was first published by the Nikkei Asian Review on April 14, 2019. ©2019 Nikkei Inc.

1;AMAT;Applied Materials;2018-11-17T00:58:53Z;Nasdaq contains losses as Nvidia woes hit chipmakers;Group’s unexpectedly weak sales guidance adds to fears electronics demand could slow;Another spate of gloomy outlook statements by computer chipmakers has cast renewed doubts on the strength of the electronics market, as shares in Nintendo and its Switch graphics unit supplier Nvidia both plunged.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell more than 1 per cent at the market’s open on Friday as unexpectedly weak sales guidance from Nvidia knocked the wider semiconductor sector and further fuelled concerns that chip demand could be set for a slowdown. By the end of the day the Nasdaq had recovered most of the losses but was 0.15 per cent lower at 7,247.87 points.Shares in Nvidia, the chip giant with a $123bn market capitalisation, suffered their worst day in years, slumping by more than 19 per cent, to eventually end the day 18.8 per cent lower at $164.43. The Silicon Valley-based company said on Thursday night that a “crypto hangover” was causing a glut of unsold graphics chips, which before the rise of bitcoin had been primarily used by video gamers. As a result, revenues in the next quarter will be about a fifth lower than what the market had forecast.The company’s powerful processors for PCs are ideally suited for handling the complex transactions that create cryptocurrencies. But demand for these chips has evaporated as a sell-off in digital currencies such as bitcoin, Ether and XRP prompted a drop-off in cryptocurrency mining activities.Investors’ panic on Friday reflected fears that crypto had been providing a far bigger boost to Nvidia’s business than investors — or perhaps even its executives — had realised, exacerbating the impact of its subsequent declines. “Simply put, the company failed to have an accurate pulse on their business,” said Gene Munster, a tech investor at Loup Ventures. Analysts say the glut could take several months to clear. “This is surely a setback. And I wish we had seen it earlier,” said Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, on a conference call. The forecast points to a 30 per cent decline in gaming revenues, its largest business unit, in the current quarter. Nvidia’s results also sparked concerns about Nintendo’s prospects for holiday console sales. In heavy trading in Tokyo, Nintendo stock fell 9 per cent, its biggest drop in more than two years. Nvidia said it expected “minimal” fourth-quarter sales of its Tegra chips, which are primarily used in Nintendo’s Switch console, though it blamed this on “normal seasonal build cycle” as manufacturers ramp up production ahead of the holidays.Nonetheless, the warnings from Nvidia will do little to calm investors who were already nervous about the prospects for sales of smartphones and other electronics ahead of next week’s Black Friday shopping frenzy and in the run-up to Christmas. Tech stocks have been hammered by concerns over softening demand for iPhones, with several of Apple’s suppliers pointing to order cuts. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index, already down 12 per cent since early September, fell another 2 per cent early on Friday but recovered some of its losses to end the day down 1.2 per cent. Within this, Advanced Micro Devices — which competes closely with Nvidia on graphics chips — fell 6 per cent at the start of trading yet bounced back slightly to end the day 3.9 per cent lower, while Micron Technology closed 1.2 per cent lower.Applied Materials, a chip equipment maker, did little to lift sentiment for the semiconductor sector after it too issued a disappointing forecast on Thursday night. Applied Materials blamed export restrictions in China, most likely a reference to the recent US ban on Fujian, for its guidance of a 12 per cent drop in sales.Its shares had been as much as 9 per cent lower ahead of the opening bell, though they pared their losses throughout Friday to be up 1.1 per cent at the close.

The technology benchmark’s 1.2 per cent drop the pervious day was its biggest one-day drop since mid-August.The Philadelphia semiconductor index lost 2.7 per cent as Micron Technology fell 9.9 per cent to $44.65 and KLA-Tencor was off 9.7 per cent, while Applied Materials declined 5.3 per cent and Advanced Micro Devices lost 2.4 per centBaird lowered its price target on Micron from $100 to $75 and warned of oversupply for Nand flash memory chips. Investors also cited trade tensions with China as a worry for semiconductor companies.The tech weakness came a day after top executives from Facebook and Twitter were grilled by senators in a Washington hearing, and Jeff Sessions, US attorney-general, asked state attorneys-general to join him for talks on whether social media platforms “may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas”.Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations, saw profit-taking after recent gains. During August, the tech sector of the S&P 500 led the benchmark’s gain with 6.7 per cent rise. Earlier this week, Amazon joined Apple as the second company with a market value topping $1tn.“Adding fuel [to the profit-taking] is US lawmakers grilling tech executives on Capitol Hill over ethics and security issues,” he said.Facebook fell 2.8 per cent per cent and Twitter was down 5.9 per centThe S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent, as Apple and Amazon lost 1.7 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 per cent, benefiting from its heavier weighting towards defensive healthcare and consumer stocks.Market volatility rose, with the Vix climbing above 15 on Thursday for the first time in intraday trade since mid-August.Tech was the second worst-performing sector in the S&P 500, with a 0.8 per cent drop. Energy fell 1.9 per cent. Telecommunications, utilities and real estate were among the segments in the black.Government bonds rallied as stocks declined. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury was down 2 basis points at 2.88 per cent.The DXY index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of global peers, was down 0.2 per cent at 95.002.

Indeed, federal funds futures priced in odds of 51 per cent that the central bank increases rates by July, up from just 17.4 per cent a week ago, Bloomberg data show.The banks group on the S&P 500 pushed higher by 3.4 per cent on the week in what was its best five-day run in a month, bringing its year-to-date decline down to 8.3 per cent. Among the gainers were Citizens Financial, which jumped 7.4 per cent on the week to $22.98, and KeyCorp, which rallied 6.9 per cent to $12.48.The largest US banks also performed well: JPMorgan Chase advanced by 3.8 per cent on the week to $63.51, Bank of America rose 4.6 per cent to $14.52 and Wells Fargo climbed 1.1 per cent to $48.75.On the other side of the spectrum were utilities stocks. The S&P 500 utilities sector dropped 2.4 per cent on the week, cutting its year-to-date gain down to about 11 per cent.Utilities, which are favoured by investors as an alternative to bonds because of their consistent dividend streams, have been key beneficiaries of the Fed’s less aggressive rate-rise plans. But the tides changed to some extent as policymakers suggested the central bank may try to get back on course to tighten policy.Duke Energy, a large power company, fell 4.7 per cent on the week to $77, while fellow electric utility Consolidated Edison dropped 3.3 per cent to $72.16.Elsewhere, Applied Materials shares logged their biggest intraday rally since November 2008 after the maker of equipment used by chipmakers unveiled a sharp rise in new orders and a rosy outlook.The California-based company said orders rose 37 per cent to $3.5bn on a year-on-year basis in the quarter to May 1, the highest mark in 15 years. Management also said it expected adjusted profits of 46 cents to 50 cents a share in the current quarter, compared with Wall Street estimates of 39 cents.Applied Materials’s shares rose 13.8 per cent to $22.66, bringing their year-to-date rally to more than 21 per cent.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,052.3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.4 per cent to 17,500.9 while the Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.2 per cent to 4,769.6.
4;AMAT;Applied Materials;2015-04-28T01:04:16Z;Shares sink after US DoJ scuppers $30bn semiconductor merger;Watchdog’s concerns see deal between Japan’s Tokyo Electron and Applied Materials collapse;Shares in Japan’s Tokyo Electron fell by 13 per cent on Tuesday morning, the biggest intraday drop in six years, after US regulators’ competition concerns scuppered its planned merger with US rival Applied Materials.The deal, which would have created a $30bn semiconductor equipment giant, collapsed late Monday Japan time, after markets there had closed.It is the second big deal to fail because of US Department of Justice pressure in the past week following cable group Comcast’s scrapping of its planned takeover of Time Warner Cable on Friday.Shares in Applied Materials were likewise hit, down 8.4 per cent by close of trading in New York.The failure of the ambitious trans-Pacific tie-up highlights how some of the most ambitious mergers in a recent wave of global dealmaking are unravelling because of regulatory concerns.In a pair of statements released on Monday in Tokyo, the two companies said the DoJ had rejected their proposed remedies to protect competition.“Based on the DoJ’s position, Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron have determined that there is no realistic prospect for the completion of the merger,” said the companies.Applied Materials said it would buy back $3bn in shares, while Tokyo Electron said it would purchase up to Y120bn worth of stock.The failure of the merger — first agreed more than 18 months ago— is likely to mean lower profit margins at Applied and Tokyo Electron but will benefit competitors such as Lam Research and customers such as Intel.The number of players in semiconductor equipment, one of the world’s most technologically demanding industries, has been falling as research and development costs increase and the pool of customers shrinks.Only a small number of chipmakers — such as Intel, TSMC and Samsung — now operate at the cutting edge of semiconductor technology, giving them significant power over equipment suppliers.A merger of Applied Materials, the largest company in the sector, with Tokyo Electron would have had about 25 per cent of the total equipment market. But it would have had market shares closer to 50 per cent for some tools, such as silicon etching machines, forming a near-duopoly with Lam Research.Y120bnTokyo Electron said it would purchase up to Y120bn worth of stockThe deal is also the second large tax inversion to collapse, after the failure of US pharma group AbbVie’s $53bn deal to acquire UK rival Shire. Tax inversions occur when a US company uses a foreign takeover to move offshore, thus escaping US tax on its international profits.As part of the merger, Applied and Tokyo Electron would have moved its domicile to the Netherlands. Applied Materials estimated its effective tax rate would have fallen from 22 per cent to 17 per cent as a result.The DoJ said remedies put forward by the companies to address its competition concerns had failed.“The companies’ decision to abandon this merger preserves competition for semiconductor manufacturing equipment,” said acting assistant attorney general Renata Hesse. “The semiconductor industry is critically important to the American economy, and the proposed remedy would not have replaced the competition eliminated by the merger, particularly with respect to the development of equipment for next-generation semiconductors.”The proposed deal was part of a broader wave of consolidation among chipmakers and their suppliers. The largest came earlier this year when NXP and Freescale agreed to merge in a deal with an enterprise value of $40bn.
5;AMAT;Applied Materials;2015-04-27T17:13:05Z;Applied Materials: chips fall where they may;If there is a time to lose out on a deal, it could be now as the semiconductor business is on the up;Even a huge share buyback is not always enough to please investors. Applied Materials, the US semiconductor equipment group, announced a $3bn repurchase plan on Monday. However, it was introduced to ease the sting of losing the $9bn acquisition of Tokyo Electron, disclosed at the same time. The companies concluded, 19 months after announcing their tie-up, that they could not satisfy the US Department of Justice, which believed the deal would reduce competition. Applied Materials shares lost 7 per cent on Monday, reducing its market value by nearly $2bn. Yet with a repurchase amounting to more than 10 per cent of the company’s market capitalisation, and a decent industry outlook, Applied Materials may survive just fine.From the start, the Applied Materials/Tokyo Electron deal was a bold play, combining two of the largest chip equipment makers. The larger US company would be acquiring a Japanese stalwart but the two pointed to the “spirit” of a merger-of-equals, making the deal more acceptable in Japan. After a stock swap, shareholders of Applied Materials would own 62 per cent of the company. The new company to be called Eteris, was then to reincorporate in the Netherlands where its tax rate of 17 per cent would be lower than Applied Materials’ 22 per cent. By 2017, the pair said that cost savings would have totalled $500m or about 15 per cent of the combined company’s operating expenses. Operating margin was to reach 25 per cent.Those efficiencies sound wonderful in a spreadsheet. But achieving them across continents would have been tricky. And if there was a moment to lose out on a transaction, it might be now. Even after Monday’s slide, Applied Materials shares are up a fifth from 19 months ago. Gartner estimates that the wafer fabrication equipment market size will be $39bn in 2018, 40 per cent greater than in 2013. Applied Materials’ fiscal year 2014 operating margin nearly hit 20 per cent on its own, up from about 14 per cent just the year before.Applied Materials still faces plenty of challenges. Semiconductors remain a notoriously cyclical industry. Consolidation among the company’s chipmaking customers has picked up substantially in the last several months. But for now, a cheaper stock translates into a more effective buyback.
6;AMAT;Applied Materials;2013-09-27T20:48:05Z;Week in Review, September 27;Applied Materials makes a canny consolidation move;"A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Chip deal shows how cost pressures drive M&AThe $10bn acquisition of Tokyo Electron by its larger US rival Applied Materials shows how intense cost pressures facing the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry is spurring consolidation, writes Jennifer Thompson.The chipmaking equipment industry is technically challenging, capital intensive and highly cyclical. Analysts regard the move as a canny one as it gives the enlarged group greater economy of scale.It is, however, too early to say whether the deal will become a cautionary or an encouraging tale for future Japanese cross-border deals.The deal represents a 6 per cent premium to Tokyo Electron’s closing share price before it was announced, and leaves the US company’s shareholders with 68 per cent of the combined group.The company – which will take on a new name – plans to maintain a dual listing on the Nasdaq and Tokyo Stock Exchange, with dual headquarters in California and Tokyo, but will shift its incorporation to the Netherlands.Gary Dickerson, Applied Materials’ chief executive, will move to Japan to run the company while Tetsuro Higashi, Tokyo Electron’s chairman and chief executive, will take on the title of chairman.On completion of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of next year, the new group plans to commence a $3bn stock repurchase programme. For Tokyo Electron shareholders, this would be the first return of this type in the company’s 50-year history.ThyssenKrupp remembers patriarch in poignant weekIt was a poignant week for ThyssenKrupp, the German steel and technology group that is grappling with huge losses from Brazil and US steel plant investments, writes Chris Bryant.If Asda needs a new head of novelty merchandise, after being forced to apologise for selling an offensive “mental patient” Halloween costume, an obvious candidate exists. UKIP’s Godfrey Bloom, fresh from offending female workers and foreigners, may be seeking a new outlet for his creativity having resigned this week as an MEP.On Thursday, top management joined figures from German business and politicsto remember Berthold Beitz, for decades a driving force behind the company, who died in July aged 99.Mr Beitz was head of the Krupp-Stiftung, ThyssenKrupp’s largest shareholder with a 25 per cent stake.The Krupp Foundation is unlikely to be such a dominant force in the future; ThyssenKrupp is considering raising capital but the foundation does not have enough funds to take part.It was therefore all the more significant that Cevian Capital, a European activist investor, this week raised its stake in ThyssenKrupp to 5.2 per cent.Cevian said it supports chief executive Heinrich Hiesinger’s strategy to transform the company, and Mr Hiesinger welcomed Cevian’s investment, saying it is a long-term investor.Since taking over in 2011, Mr Hiesinger has sold assets equivalent to one-quarter of the company’s revenues and overhauled the management.ThyssenKrupp’s share price, which has halved since June 2011, has not yet felt the benefit, in part because of problems selling the US and Brazilian steel plants.Cevian said it might increase its stake if ThyssenKrupp decides to raise capital, triggering speculation that it might push for more changes. Analysts have speculated ThyssenKrupp might spin off its European steel business.Brave new world awaits Uralkali and new partnerThe showdown between Russian fertiliser group Uralkali and neighbouring Belarus could be compared to a romantic break-up gone wrong. The tale, as one person close to the company puts it, goes like this, writes Courtney Weaver.Girl breaks up with boy – or in this case Uralkali oligarch shareholder Suleiman Kerimov ditches Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.In revenge, boy takes girl’s brother (Uralkali chief executive Vladislav Baumgertner) and throws him in a Minsk jail. To free brother, girl must find a new friend to date boy (in this case a Russian-Belarusian potash export cartel).Currently, about half-a-dozen Russian billionaires are auditioning for this role and preparing to make bids on Mr Kerimov’s 22 per cent stake in Uralkali. Two other billionaires who collectively own about 12 per cent of Uralkali could also sell out.Solanio: “What news?” Salerio: “Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrecked.” Solanio: “Check your iPad!” Modern stagings of The Merchant of Venice may need to include the line, now that shipping bible Lloyd’s List is going digital-only, after nearly 300 years. But Peter Pan’s Captain Hook could struggle with a touchscreen.The motley group includes Mikhail Prokhorov, the Brooklyn Nets basketball owner; Arkady Rotenberg, a billionaire and Vladimir Putin’s former judo partner; two billionaires Vladimir Evtushenkov and Mikhail Gutseriev who are acting together; and Vladimir Kogan, a former government official.Industry analysts and investors expect the appearance of a new shareholder to pave the way for Uralkali to resume its potash export cartel with Belarus – a move that would give the pricing advantage back to potash producers.There are signs the two parties are moving to a rekindling. Mr Baumgertner was moved from jail to house arrest on Thursday.However, any new relationship will look different. This week, China’s sovereign wealth fund CIC acquired a 12.5 per cent stake in Uralkali, giving one of its biggest customers insight into its pricing and negotiating strategies.A brave new world of potash, indeed.Barclays and Credit Suisse withdraw from peripheriesBanks’ efforts to combat spiralling costs from stricter regulation in their wealth management business were highlighted when Barclays and Credit Suisse this week said they would withdraw from scores of peripheral markets, writes Daniel Schäfer.Barclays said it would pull out of about 130 countries in the next three years in a move to improve its wealth management unit’s feeble profitability. It will focus on 70 countries that encompass about 80 per cent of the world’s wealth.The move comes as a realisation by the UK bank that it is uneconomic to fly wealth advisers in and out of small countries for just a few customers at a time of rapidly rising expenditures for anti-money laundering rules and increasing risks of reputational damage and fines for breaking them.It came in the same week as Swiss rival Credit Suisse said its private bank would exit or withdraw from about 50 markets worldwide by 2014, mainly African and central Asian nations where the returns do not justify the costs of vetting clients.At Barclays, the changes are being spearheaded by Peter Horrell, who has been interim chief executive at Barclays Wealth and Investment Management and who was named the unit’s permanent head this week.Barclays’ wealth management business has faced turbulent times this year. Mr Horrell’s predecessor, Tom Kalaris, left the bank this spring and in January it emerged that a senior employee at its US wealth arm had destroyed an independent report highlighting serious cultural issues within the division."

While M&A activity in Europe may have fallen a quarter in the past nine months from a year ago, there was plenty of action elsewhere.Applied Materials, the leader in semiconductor manufacturing equipment announced a $10bn all-stock merger with Japan’s Tokyo Electron. Another Japanese company, Lixil, bought Grohe, a German maker of bathroom fittings worth €3.1bn. Meanwhile, Michael Dell’s leveraged buyout offer for the beleaguered computer maker he founded finally came to a close. And struggling BlackBerry found a buyer in the form of Fairfax Financial, but that is not yet a done deal. Finally, activist investor Starboard Value failed to find counter bidders for Smithfield Foods. That leaves China’s Shuanghui as the clear frontrunner to buy the US pork producer.Elsewhere, investors in JPMorgan are in a bind as legal settlements drag on. This week the bank paid $1bn in penalties for the London Whale trading scandal while its chief executive met the US attorney-general to try to close in on a settlement for alleged mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities. JC Penney, the US retailer, also suffered a rollercoaster ride this week. Its shares plunged 15 per cent on Wednesday after a research report from Goldman Sachs forecast a slower-than-expected improvement in sales. The stock bounced back on Thursday when the retailer said it was pleased with same store sales growth only to start falling again after announcing it will sell nearly a third of the company in a public offering to raise cash.In Asia, it turns out the Hong Kong stock exchange does not want the business – it turned down Chinese internet group Alibaba’s attempts to list there. But the exchange had good grounds to put its foot down – Alibaba’s founders wanted more control than their ownership warrants.
8;AMAT;Applied Materials;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
9;AMAT;Applied Materials;2013-09-25T15:13:22Z;Tokyo Electron deal may spark further foreign takeovers;;Given the rarity of foreign takeovers in Japan, a 6 per cent premium for chip equipment maker Applied Materials of the US to acquire Tokyo Electron might appear rather modest for the Japanese company’s shareholders.There are, however, other incentives for them to approve the $10bn deal. The combined company is proposing a $3bn share buyback within 12 months of the merger, the first return of this type in the semiconductor equipment maker’s 50-year history.Analysts point to longer-term benefits as well. The deal will bring together the biggest and third-biggest producers in a highly cyclical, competitive and fast consolidating market.Tokyo Electron’s net income in the year to March 31 plummeted more than 80 per cent to Y6bn ($61m). Analysts say the company could have survived, but its declining profitability was a cause for concern.The deal not only promises $500m in operational synergies, but to also create a company with strong market positions in a range of chipmaking equipment. For example, the enlarged company would have a more than 40 per cent share of the market for etchers, a key type of equipment for making advanced memory chips, says Hisashi Moriyama, analyst at JPMorgan.For Tokyo Electron shareholders, there are also the contrasting fortunes of chipmakers Elpida and Renesas to consider. Elpida, once Japan’s biggest memory chipmaker but still too small to compete with market leader Samsung, became the country’s biggest manufacturing bankruptcy after two government bailouts. It was eventually bought on the cheap by Micron of the US in a deal that left even debt holders of Elpida substantially out of pocket.In Renesas’ case, an investment fund controlled by Japan’s government bought a majority stake in the chipmaker for $2.2bn last year, thwarting a rival bid from KKR.The deal drew criticism at the time for staking Japanese taxpayer funds on reviving Renesas when a private foreign buyer was available. Renesas’ shares, however, are up 58 per cent so far this year, and its net loss has narrowed to Y3.9bn in the quarter to June, against Y20.7bn a year ago.It is still too early to say whether Tokyo Electron’s sale to Applied Materials will become a cautionary or an encouraging tale for future Japanese cross-border deals, but some already believe that it could make the idea of foreign takeovers more palatable.“This could well become a catalyst for more Japanese companies to become prepared for the possibility of being acquired,” added Mr Aritomi.
10;AMAT;Applied Materials;2013-09-24T20:05:54Z;Applied Materials sees shares rise after $10bn Tokyo Electron deal;;Applied Materials, the US maker of equipment used to manufacture semiconductors, has sought to extend its lead in one of the world’s most technically challenging and capital intensive industries by acquiring Japanese rival Tokyo Electron for stock valued at nearly $10bn.News of the deal – which the companies said would speed the creation of new technologies for smartphones, TVs and solar panels – was greeted with a 6 per cent rise in Applied Materials’ share price, boosting the prospective market value of the enlarged company to more than $30bn.The merged group – which will take on a new name – plans to maintain a dual listing on the Nasdaq and Tokyo Stock Exchange, with dual headquarters in California and Tokyo, but will shift its incorporation to the Netherlands.This change of legal domicile will enable the company to route its international profits through lower-tax countries, according to a person familiar with the deal, reducing its planned tax rate to 17 per cent from a current target of 22 per cent.Applied Materials paid a premium of some 6 per cent for the Japanese company and its shareholders will own 68 per cent of the enlarged company.The deal will give Applied Materials a leg up over closest rival, ASML of the Netherlands, lifting its market share in semiconductor manufacturing equipment to about 25 per cent, according to 2012 data from Gartner, the technology research firm. While the highly cyclical market shrank globally last year, demand for smartphone and tablet microchips was one bright spot in the sector.Gary Dickerson, Applied Material’s chief executive, will move to Japan to run the company while Tetsuro Higashi, Tokyo Electron’s chairman and chief executive, will take on the title of chairman.Under the terms of the deal, Tokyo Electron shareholders will receive 3.25 shares of the new company for every Tokyo Electron share currently held. Tokyo Electron shares closed at Y4,800 before the deal was announced, valuing the company’s equity at Y872.35bn ($8.85bn).On completion of the deal, which is expected in the second half of next year, the new group plans to commence a $3bn stock repurchase programme.“We are building this new company in the spirit of a merger of equals,” said Gary Dickerson, chief executive of Applied Materials, and Tetsuro Higashi, chairman and chief executive of Tokyo Electron.Mr Dickerson took over as chief executive of Applied Materials at the beginning of this month after Mike Splinter moved up to become executive chairman of the US group following a decade as CEO.
11;AMAT;Applied Materials;2013-09-24T18:26:48Z;Chip groups consolidate against cyclical challenge;;Faced with some of the toughest conditions in the global technology industry, it isn’t hard to see why a giant cross-border acquisition that promises to squeeze out costs and boost cash returns to shareholders should have been cheered on Wall Street when it was unveiled on Tuesday.The deal is likely to come under close scrutiny from tax and antitrust authorities in the US and Japan, however, as regulators weigh the lengths the two companies have gone to resolve the financial stresses they face.Applied Materials, the world’s biggest producer by revenues of the equipment used to make semiconductors, agreed to issue stock valued on Tuesday at about $9.7bn to buy Tokyo Electron, the market’s third-biggest producer.The deal represented a 6 per cent premium to TE’s closing share price before the deal was announced, and left the US company’s shareholders with 68 per cent of the combined group, which both sides sought to depict as a merger of equals.Applied Materials’ move – which comes in the wake of its $4.2bn purchase of Varian Semiconductor two years ago – marks a direct response to the financial pressures of the fast-consolidating market for the highly complex equipment used to make semiconductors, according to industry watchers.“It’s all cyclical and no growth,” said Angelo Zino, an equity analyst at Standard & Poor’s. The equipment makers’ cycle is even more severe than the one faced by semiconductor makers themselves: sales of the equipment used in the giant wafer fabs that produce chips, for instance, plunged to $12.4bn in 2009, from $32.9bn two years before.Adding to the challenges, a technology transition on the horizon threatens to greatly increase the costs of staying among the industry’s global leaders. As chip sizes continue to shrink, makers are facing a shift from the current generation of technology, which involves etching tiny elements on to chips, to imprinting them with extreme ultraviolet lithography, known as EUV.At the same time, the size of the silicon wafers out of which chips are cut is set to increase, adding a second dimension to the transition.Even before those developments, which are still estimated to be some five years away, equipment makers must grapple with new challenges posed by the shift to mobile devices like smartphones – for instance, packing more processing power into smaller chips that operate on lower power consumption.In this technology race, said Bob Halliday, Applied Materials’ chief financial officer, capital intensity and R&D costs were rising fast – along with the potential returns to investors. “If you have the best product, you end up with a very high market share,” he said.In one sign of the need for new investment, Dutch rival ASML, the second-largest player, received €3.85bn in investment last year from three crucial customers – Intel, TSMC and Samsung – to finance its research and development.Merging the US and Japanese equipment makers should ease some of the financial pressure by wiping $500m from their costs within three years, according to their own estimates. That would take 13 per cent off their combined operating expenses, according to Mr Zito.The deal also promises to make much more efficient use of the enlarged company’s cash resources – though to the likely detriment of tax authorities in their respective countries.“The free and easy movement of cash around the world is increased by the structure we’re looking at,” Gary Dickerson, Applied Materials’ chief executive, said, in a disarmingly open testament to the financial planning behind the deal.Applied Materials will shift its headquarters to the Netherlands as part of the transaction – a decision that will boost its tax efficiency – though the two companies sought to depict this as a “new start” for a new company being created by the deal.According to one person familiar with the deal, the move will bring two benefits – allowing the company to pass more of its international profits through low-tax jurisdictions while also making it easier to pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends, without first repatriating it to the US, where it would face a higher tax charge.The more effective tax planning enabled by the move was designed to bring the company’s effective tax rate down to 17 per cent, from a current target rate of 22 per cent, executives said. Antitrust regulators were also likely to take a close look at the transaction, which will leave the combined company, which is to take on a new name, with about 25 per cent of the global equipment business, based on 2012 market share figures compiled by Gartner.The merger, which requires approval from both companies’ shareholders and from regulators including the US Department of Justice and China’s trade ministry, is expected to close by the second half of 2014.
12;AMAT;Applied Materials;2013-09-24T12:35:08Z;Applied Materials / Tokyo Electron: no ‘I’ in team;Mergers of equals do not exist;"What, exactly, makes the deal between Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron a “merger of equals”, as the companies would have it? Applied Materials, the leader in semiconductor manufacturing equipment with a $20bn market cap, is no equal of Tokyo Electron, which has less than half the equity value. In an industry aching for consolidation, however, the question is whether the players have the dexterity to get deals done. So while a low-premium, all-stock deal does not make the companies equal, or make a takeout into a merger, it does make sense.Look for the dynamics at chipmakers such as Intel to explain this tie-up. More complex chips for new phones and gadgets require the knowhow of the equipment makers and a combined Applied/Electon provides a one-stop shop. And with the chipmakers consolidating themselves, the equipment makers now need their own heft.The all-stock deal, despite the complicated way it divvies up ownership and management, is the optimal structure for Applied. It has no net debt, even after a $5bn cash acquisition two years ago. Still, given the wild cycles in semiconductor demand, piling on billions of new debt to pay for Electron would make little sense. Electron is in essence being acquired at a modest 6 per cent premium. The 32 per cent ownership Electron’s shareholders will receive in the new Applied Materials is in-line with the relative market caps of the two over 2013. Applied is far more profitable; based on consensus estimates for 2014, Applied will provide more than 80 per cent of group profit. But the buyers hope that the addition of Electron is to lead to $500m in synergies. Those will more than double Applied’s operating margin, to 25 per cent. Perhaps the promised synergies will not match the realised ones, as is often the case in big mergers. The silver lining for Applied is that, in that case, Electron’s shareholders will bear some of the pain.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

Shares in ACCO rose 26. 4 per cent to $8.80.CF Industries Holdings fell 10.2 per cent to $149.96, and Mosaic tumbled 7 per cent to $50.76, as falling corn prices raised fears that demand for fertiliser will far.“The perception among investors is that as the price of corn drops farmers cut back on fertiliser use,” said Colin Isaac, chemicals analyst at Atlantic Equities. “Although that does not always turn out to be the case, but fertiliser stocks are highly correlated to the corn price.”AMR Corp, the parent company of American Airlines, fell 5.5 per cent to $1.72, after hitting an 8 year intra day low of $1.63. Bankruptcy fears spiked again, on reports that American did not plan to restart negotiations with its pilot union, and chances recede of a deal to rein in costs.
17;AMAT;Applied Materials;2011-09-27T22:12:05Z;Chipmakers get serious on bigger discs;;Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, announced on Tuesday $4.4bn of investments involving chipmakers that would make his state “the epicentre for the next generation of computer chip technology”.Silicon Valley may be surprised to hear it has been dethroned and, cutting through the political hyperbole, the real significance here for semiconductors seems to be a readiness of the main players to cooperate on moving to the next-generation of silicon wafers.The bulk of the money – $3.6bn – is coming from IBM and most of this will be used to upgrade its factories in the state to production of chips with circuit widths of 22 and then 14 billionths of a metre – the next levels of miniaturisation.Of the other $800m, it seems the state will provide half and Intel, Globalfoundries, TSMC and Samsung will put up the rest for research and development work into a new wafer size at facilities such as the College for Nanoscale and Science Engineering.The current standard is for chips to be cut from circular wafers 300mm (12in) in diameter. But the industry wants to move to 450mm (18in) wafers that would allow double the number of chips to be cut from them, bringing substantial cost savings.Plenty of R&D needs to be done first to work out how to produce such wafers as they include circuitry of smaller and smaller widths. But the main delay to 450mm being introduced has been the reluctance of the industry to bear the cost of re-equipping factories for the new size.Chip toolmakers such as Applied Materials have begun to invest in the transition, but they have said there needs to be more cooperation and willingness to share the costs from the chipmakers this time around, compared to the last wafer transition from 200mm to 300mm.The New York announcement shows that this is now beginning to happen. The main players – Globalfoundries, IBM, Intel, Samsung and TSMC – have formed a partnership called the Global 450 Consortium.Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive (pictured), said in a statement: “This new technology will reduce the cost of production, increase productivity for manufacturers and reduce our environmental footprint on a per chip basis.”So the investment is good news for New York and jobs there, but it is also welcome news for chipmakers and their suppliers, and ultimately for consumers as well, as reduced costs make our electronic devices cheaper.That is still some way out though, with the capital investments being made over time. Analysts at Stifel, Nicolaus and Co say they “remain steadfast to the view that this transition will not likely occur until late in this decade or early in the next one”.
18;AMAT;Applied Materials;2011-09-01T20:54:21Z;SAIC falls over government contract concerns;Financials lead losses on Wall Street, helping to push the S&P 500 index down more than 1 per cent, and ending its four-day rally;Companies dependent on government contracts for revenue led Wall Street down, after a key government supplier missed earnings reports and forecast more gloom.SAIC, an IT and technology government contractor, reported quarterly earnings of 32 cents a share, 3 cents lower than expected, as revenue fell 6 per cent quarter-on-quarter.SAIC shares were down 13.5 per cent at $12.97.Stifel Nicolaus analyst William Loomis downgraded SAIC from buy to hold, and said he was worried that the government appeared to be cutting back on funding for contracts it had already awarded to SAIC.He also stripped his buy recommendation from Booz Allen Hamilton Holding, the public sector offshoot of the management consultancy Booz Allen, which has heavy exposure to federal government IT contracts. Booz shares fell 6.4 per cent to $15.02.“The whole sector faces a tricky dilemma. The amount of bid opportunities has actually gone up, because after budget negotiations the government now has a backlog of contracts to put out to tender. So companies have increased spending around business development,” Mr Loomis said.“But if those contracts are not awarded so projects can be ramped up, and revenue starts flowing, it could be difficult.”The broad S&P 500 index was down 1.2 per cent at 1,204.42, ending a four-day rally.Financial stocks fell 2.4 per cent, more than any other sector.Goldman Sachs was down 3.5 per cent to $112.16 after writing down $53m of delinquent mortgage loans as part of a deal over mortgage and foreclosure practices at its former subsidiary Litton Loan Servicing.The Federal Reserve Board had alleged a “pattern of misconduct and negligence” at Litton.Bank of New York Mellon outperformed the sector, despite the departure of chief executive Robert Kelly late on Wednesday.BNY Mellon shares were only down 0.2 per cent at $20.63 after Rochdale Securities analyst Dick Bove said the bank was sitting on a “staggering” cash pile.Semiconductor companies had a volatile day after analysts disputed whether burgeoning demand from smartphone manufacturers will be enough to compensate for falling sales to computer makers.Shares in Nvidia outperformed the Nasdaq Composite index by more than 1 per cent, after Kaufman Brothers analyst Mike Burton initiated coverage with a buy recommendation. The Nasdaq was down 1.3 per cent at 2,546.04, but Nvidia shares were only off 0.2 per cent at $13.28.“We view Nvidia as a major beneficiary of the convergence of mobility and computing,” Mr Burton said.Glen Yeung, Citigroup’s technology analyst, also said smartphone demand could offset falling industrial demand ahead of an industry conference.“We expect the tone from chip companies to reflect uncertainty … we do not, however, expect chip companies to lower guidance en masse, reflecting the dearth of actual order cuts quarter-to-date.”That pushed Micron Technology and SanDisk, which manufacture Dram memory chips used in computers and phones, into positive territory in early trading. But Micron closed at $5.74, down 2.9 per cent for the day and SanDisk dropped 1 per cent to $36.27.Manufacturers with exposure to industries other than computing had outperformed in August but on Thursday their shares were pushed back as investors traded on enthusiasm for smartphones.Applied Materials, a company whose chips end up in solar panels, was off 2.3 per cent at $11.06.Novellus, whose semiconductors are used in various industrial processes, fell 3.3 per cent to $27.05 after the company used a mid-quarter update late on Wednesday to lower revenue targets.Not every analyst shared the enthusiasm for smartphones. Mr Yeung’s Citigroup colleague Henry Kim predicted a “double-dip in DRAM”.“We are revising down our global memory industry revenue forecast by 19 per cent on weaker pricing from low demand and expect industry revenue to decline by 13 per cent year on year in 2011 earnings,” Mr Kim said.Robert Lea, South Korea-based semiconductor analyst for Jefferies, who initiated coverage of Taiwan Semiconductor with a hold rating, was also downbeat on the sector.“Semiconductor industry inventories [excluding memory] have risen for seven consecutive quarters to an estimated 81.5 days”, while at the same time, “revenue growth has stalled”, Mr Lea said.TSM shares were down 0.7 per cent at $11.89.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1 per cent for the day at 11,493.57, pushing it back into negative territory for the year to date.
19;AMAT;Applied Materials;2011-08-29T14:16:15Z;Wall Street up on consumer spending data;;The S&P 500 closed above 1,200 for the first time in two weeks as traders seized on better than expected consumer spending figures to propel a broad market rally.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 rose 4.2 per cent, led by insurance groups, which avoided big pay outs after hurricane Irene left New York relatively unscathed. Irene had been downgraded to a tropical storm shortly before it made landfall, and markets opened as usual Monday morning. Hartford Financial Services was up 13 per cent at $19.42. Allstate rose 8.5 per cent to $26.30.Bank of America was up 8.1 per cent at $8.39, after it announced the $8.3bn sale of half of its 10 per cent stake in China Construction Bank. Some analysts had expected the bank to dispose of its entire stake in CCB to raise capital, but analysts were pleased with the price, which represents a premium over the $7.3bn received for 6 per cent of CCB in 2009.“The price seems good to me, and BofA are shrinking their balance sheet and disposing of non-core assets, which is what markets are telling them to do,” said Paul Miller at FBR Capital Markets.The S&P 500 closed up 2.8 per cent at 1,210.08, above the 1,200 barrier at which bears have offered resistance. But trading was lower than on any other day this month, leaving traders cautious about reading too much into the rally.“Technicians will tell you they want the S&P 500 to reach 1,200 on strong volume,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential. “In a rally, more than percentage rises, volume is important.”Media groups dependent on advertising for revenue outperformed the S&P 500. The sector suffered losses last week after Citigroup downgraded several stocks citing expected sluggish growth in consumer spending.Cable company CBS was up 5.6 per cent at $24.47 and Gannett, which owns magazines and newspapers including USA Today, was up 8.1 per cent at $11.56.James Dix at Wedbush said an economic slowdown would not necessarily hurt media companies immediately. “Large companies are not as highly levered as they were in 2008. That gives them some flexibility to keep spending on advertising to gain market share, in the hope that any downturn will be short,” he said.But he said he preferred to hold advertising agency stocks over advertising-dependent media groups.“Advertising agencies have exposure to emerging markets, because companies will still be looking to grow their brands there by deploying marketing budgets. But if you are looking for growth in China, you won’t advertise on CBS.“Margins are also tougher for media groups. Advertising companies can lay off staff in a downturn, but media companies have high fixed costs. They have already invested in their content and need to sell advertising to make a profit.”Advertising agencies had a mixed day. Omnicom Group was up only 2.1 per cent to $40.01. Rival Interpublic Group, a big advertising agency, was up 7.2 per cent at $8.66.Micron Technology, the semiconductor manufacturer, gained 8.6 per cent to close at $6.15.The group has rallied almost 20 per cent since a dramatic fall last Wednesday, when the company warned it would miss revenue expectations because of falling demand for the Dram components it makes for computers.Since then the Dram spot price has unexpectedly risen almost 5 per cent, continuing gains today, despite a report by business research group IHS, which predicted “free-falling prices are in store in the third quarter”.Other semiconductor stocks also gained. Applied Materials was up 3.7 per cent to $11.39.Based on the quarterly earnings reports of the main semiconductor manufacturers, Citigroup analyst Timothy Arcuri estimated orders had fallen 50 per cent to $20bn during the quarter.But Mr Arcuri said current stock prices reflect depressed demand sufficiently, and said the sector may have now troughed.Monsanto shares fell 1.3 per cent on reports that one of its genetically modified corn crops may have developed resistance to pesticides.Zillow rose 5.3 per cent to $33.04, after Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney initiated coverage with a $36 target and recommendation to “buy”. Mr Mahaney cited the company’s first mover status in online property search and the size of the US property market.Citi, which was the main underwriter of Zillow’s IPO, becomes the first major bank to cover the stock.Youku shares were up 7 per cent at $24.95 after the Chinese video-sharing website announced an online distribution agreement for rights to the DreamWorks Animation Kung Fu Panda franchise films in mainland China. The deal marks the first time DWA titles will be made available through an online platform in China.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.7 per cent at 11,447.49 and the Nasdaq index of tech shares rose 2.5 per cent to 2,542.86 at midday.
20;AMAT;Applied Materials;2011-08-26T14:29:02Z;Wall Street sticks to positive territory;;"Wall Street ended the week more than 4 per cent up, its first weekly rise since mid-July.Stocks had edged up during a see-saw week in anticipation of Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s Jackson Hole speech. Bulls expected him to signal a new round of quantitative easing, or at least detail other policy options at his disposal. In the end Mr Bernanke promised only to act “as appropriate”.But despite a dip immediately following the speech on Friday morning, the S&P 500 rallied strongly to close at 1,176.79, up 1.5 per cent on the day, 4.5 per cent for the week.Yet despite the week’s gains, the broad index has not been able to scale and hold the psychologically important 1,200 mark. Selling bears offered resistance whenever the index neared that level.“There was much anticipation given the potential binary market outcome,” Robin Lowe, head of equities at Man Group, said of Ben Bernanke’s speech. “However, the near-term interpretation has been one of minimal change.”Market lows last week meant “lots of funds who successfully held on to shorts have been increasingly cutting those positions as those stocks hit the bottom end of price targets”, according to Mr Lowe.But he warned that caution among hedge fund managers could hold back any rally. “For now, funds are largely in a wait-and-see mode. Few hedge funds are initiating aggressive new long-term positions or changes in view.“Some funds might also be facing redemptions in coming weeks, from investors who opted to take money out when markets fell earlier in the month, but had to serve a notice period,” he added.Financials were the big gainers this week, with bank stocks in the S&P 500 index up 5.1 per cent. But despite, Warren Buffett’s $5bn investment in Bank of America, Citigroup led the pack, up 11.2 per cent at $29.84.BofA was up 10.5 per cent at $7.76. But concerns persist about legal risk from mortgage selling and foreclosure practices, as well as the size of the bank’s mortgage book.Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr said the “sell-off [in BofA] may be overdone” and set a target price of $11, even before Mr Buffett’s investment.But Mr Schorr said the stock still compared unfavourably with Citigroup, citing Citi’s better tier one capital ratio, 6.7 per cent to BofA’s 5.1 per cent; smaller mortgage portfolio ($431bn to $1,600bn at BofA); and less legal risk from continuing claims relating to mortgage mis-selling and trading.Sprint Nextel shares were a surprise faller in a week where it was reported that the cellular network provider would be able to offer customers the iPhone 5 later this year. The company’s shares were down 5 per cent for the week at $3.25.The iPhone reports had led Sprint shares to rise 10 per cent on Tuesday, trading as high as $3.66, the biggest single day rise for the company this year.“Sprint has been losing market share in the lucrative post-paid [monthly contract] market to Verizon and AT&T, because they have superior smartphones. With the iPhone 5 it can compete for those all-important high-margin customers. It could be very significant,” according to Michael Nelson at Mizuho Securities.But investors reassessed the move over the week, and Sprint was among the biggest fallers in the S&P 500 index for three successive days, as analysts warned the iPhone 5 will hurt margins, even if it attracts subscribers.“The subsidy [network providers pay iPhone users] is $400 per phone. That is almost double that of other phones,” UBS analyst John Hodulik warned. “The impact on Sprint’s margins and cash flow is likely to be more severe than expected given its already low level of profitability.”Sprint shares have now declined almost 40 per cent since the start of market volatility earlier this month, while its competitors Verizon and AT&T are flat for the month, significantly outperforming the market.Tiffany & Co was up 20.0 per cent for the week at $69.01, after a strong quarterly earnings report. Strong demand from the Asia-Pacific region drove quarterly earnings of 86 cents a share, well above expectations of about 71 cents a share.The world’s second-largest luxury jewellery retailer raised its earnings per share forecast for the year ending January 2012 to $3.75 from $3.55.Shares in leather retailer Coach, up 19.2 per cent at $54.76, capped a rare good week for retailers, as consumer discretionary shares in the S&P 500 rose 6.0 per cent, one of the best performing sectors, after several weeks of heavy losses.Zillow shares were up 31.0 per cent at $31.38 as the online property search company reported a profit in its first quarterly results as a publicly traded company. The shares are now trading well above the IPO offer price.Homebuilder PulteGroup also rose 13.3 per cent for the week to $4.48 after better-than-expected house price data.First Solar was up 13.7 at $100.71 after a bullish Goldman Sachs note on the solar industry and an upgrade from Collins Stewart, which noted the company’s low price-to-earnings ratio and a backlog of orders for projects in Nevada and California.Semiconductor manufacturers endured a mixed week. Shares in Micron Technology slumped more than 6 per cent on Wednesday after the company warned of lower revenue, because of weak demand from computer companies. But Micron shares closed the week up 8.9 per cent at $5.66.Applied Materials was meant to fare better because it supplies solar panel manufacturers as well as computer firms, but its shares underperformed the market, up only 1.8 per cent at $11.06, on weak sales from its solar unit."
21;AMAT;Applied Materials;2011-08-25T21:10:06Z;Wall Street falls despite Buffett’s BofA stake;;Big bank stocks rallied but the broader market sold off as Wall Street reacted to Warren Buffett’s swoop for $5bn of preferred stock in Bank of America.BofA shares, which have swung wildly during a week in which the company has been forced to publicly defend its capital adequacy, were up 9.4 per cent to $7.65.The stock had soared as high as $8.80 soon after the bell, touching levels not seen since early August, before it fell 20.3 per cent in one day, following S&P’s downgrade of US sovereign credit.Mr Buffett said he was impressed with “the profit-generating abilities” of BofA and had initiated discussions with Brian Moynihan, the bank’s chief executive, after the share price lost half its value this year on continuing concerns about mortgage-related losses.Big bank-watchers were emboldened by Buffett’s move. Citigroup was up 4.3 per cent to $29.83 and Morgan Stanley rose 2.7 per cent to $16.77.Financials was the best-performing sector in the S&P 500 index, down only 0.5 per cent. But, in a reminder of the sector’s ongoing legal problems, Citigroup and Bank of America were both among the 11 banks sued by broker Charles Schwab for manipulating Libor rates by underestimating borrowing costs from 2007 onwards.Apple shares declined 0.7 per cent to $373.72 but still outperformed the market, despite the news that Steve Jobs will resign as chief executive. Mark Moskowitz, analyst at JPMorgan, said “A CEO change had [already] been partly discounted.” He reiterated his “overweight” rating, adding: “We expect the stock to be under pressure but not encounter a downdraft.”Some dissent was offered by Mike Abramsky, of RBC Capital Markets, who said Mr Jobs’ departure added “above-average risk” to his “outperform” rating.“Investors may start to fret ‘what’s next’? Can Apple – now the largest company in tech – keep its ‘cool’ and wow factor? Can they remain unassailable?”The broad S&P 500 index was down 1.6 per cent at 1,159.27, dragged down by worse-than-expected jobless claims data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.5 per cent at 11,149.90.“Bank of America and Apple are just a sideshow,” Canning Smith, manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund, said. “The BofA deal will hopefully put banks on a more even keel but markets are trading on the macroeconomic situation right now and all eyes are on Jackson Hole tomorrow.“A note by Nomura strategists Ankur Mehta and Ohmsatya Ravi predicting an Obama administration initiative to allow government-backed mortgage holders to refinance at low rates, pushed homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.8 per cent to $4.24.Shares in online property search firm Zillow also jumped 15.2 per cent to $30.25, after the company reported a profit in its first quarterly results as a publicly traded company. Zillow defied the housing market slump to post revenue of $15.8m, up 116 per cent year on year.That was welcome cheer for tech investors, after four scheduled tech initial public offerings had been put back in recent weeks due to market volatility. Zillow is now trading well above its $20 IPO price, despite recent market turbulence.But traditional commercial property manager CB Richard Ellis was down 9.2 per cent at $13.76 on the web start-up’s success. Research in Motion was off 1.2 per cent to $28.22 after announcing a new music streaming service for its BlackBerry handsets.Verizon Communications was off 1.9 per cent at $35.77 after it announced the acquisition of CloudSwitch, a cloud software provider. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.Verizon also announced it would allow businesses to process credit card payments via smartphones and tablets through an alliance with Intuit. But Intuit shares dropped 2.7 per cent to $44.62.Verizon’s competitor, Sprint Nextel, dropped 6.4 per cent to $3.23, as positive sentiment, stemming from reports the network will offer the iPhone 5 later this year, ebbed.Three companies to report earnings before the bell were among the biggest fallers in the S&P 500.Applied Materials, a manufacturer of semiconductor parts, lost 4.9 per cent to close at $10.81 on quarterly earnings per share of 36 cents, exactly four times the equivalent figure for the same quarter last year, and 2 cents above most expectations.Hormel Foods, which sells ready-made food staples, was down 7.3 per cent at $26.36, despite reporting quarterly earnings per share of 36 cents a share, 4 cents higher than the same quarter last year.Patterson Companies, a medical, dental and veterinary supplies company, dropped 10.2 per cent to $26.87 after reporting quarterly earnings per share of 42 cents, 3 cents lower than the previous quarter.

The stock had touched a low of $6.01, not seen since 2009, on Tuesday, as investors fretted about the bank’s capital adequacy levels.Glenn Schorr, director of US financial equities at Nomura, said the “sell-off [in BofA] may be overdone” and set a target price of $11.But Mr Schorr said the stock still compared unfavourably to Citigroup, citing Citi’s better tier one capital ratio – 6.7 per cent to BofA’s 5.1 per cent – smaller mortgage portfolio ($431bn to $1,600bn at BofA) and less legal risk from continuing claims relating to mortgage mis-selling and trading.Citigroup was up 4.1 per cent per cent at $28.45, Goldman Sachs climbed 3.2 per cent to $110.31 and Genworth Financial put on 6.7 per cent to close at $6.55, as financial stocks in the S&P 500 strongly outperformed the index, up 2.8 per cent. The broader KBW bank index gained 3.3 per cent to close at 37.72.The main S&P 500 index climbed 1.3 per cent to 1,177.60, now up 4.8 per cent for the week. But defensive utility stocks were up 2 per cent in a sign of continuing investor nervousness.Traders are hoping the index will break through the 1,200 level, which has proved a barrier since market volatility heightened at the start of August.McGraw-Hill companies, whose businesses include Standard & Poor’s and several media companies, rose 7.4 per cent to $41.30 after JPMorgan said shareholders could gain $5bn if the parent company was split and individual businesses sold.CVS Caremark, was up 3 per cent at $34.44, after the pharmacist announced plans to buy back at least $1bn in shares by the end of the year, as part of a larger $4bn programme.Wednesday saw good economic data. Orders for durable goods were up 4 per cent month-on-month in July, the biggest climb in four months, and well above expectations of a 2 per cent rise.House prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent month-on-month in June, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The homebuilder PulteGroup climbed 4.2 per cent to $3.76.Stock exchange operators gained after Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst at Raymond James, tipped them to benefit from rising transaction volume in volatile markets.The New York Stock Exchange was up 4 per cent at $27.28, and Nasdaq OMX climbed 3.1 per cent to $23.05. Alex Kramm at UBS upgraded Nasdaq to buy, targeting $28, also on high transaction volume.Sprint Nextel lost 3.9 per cent to $3.45. Reports the mobile phone network will be able to offer the iPhone 5 handset by the end of the year had led shares to rise 10.1 per cent Tuesday.But UBS telecoms analyst John Hodulik warned that, while the Iphone would attract new subscribers, higher upfront subsidy costs would drive down margins.Research in Motion put on 3.9 per cent to close at $34.44, on reports its new Blackberry models will be able to run applications built for Google’s Android operating system.Semiconductor manufacturers and suppliers slipped after JPMorgan forecast lower demand for the industry, due to the weak macroeconomic situation.Micron Technology, which supplies computer manufacturers, led fallers in the S&P 500. Its shares slid 6.4 per cent at $5.30, after it gave advance warning of lower revenue.Cisco Systems was the second worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 0.1 per cent to $15.46. The broad index gained 1.3 per cent to close at 11,320.56.Volterra Semiconductors lost 7.9 per cent to close at $20.10, after Collins Stewart lowered its forecast, citing expected weak demand from Intel, a key Volterra client.The Nasdaq composite index underperformed the S&P 500, up 0.9 per cent at 2,467.69.Applied Materials, which supplies parts for solar panels as well as computer semiconductors, was boosted by a bullish Goldman Sachs note on the solar industry.Its shares were down 0.7 per cent on the day at $11.36, but were still up 5 per cent for the week, before an earnings report after the bell on Wednesday.Avago Technologies, a San Jose-based manufacturer of semiconductors for phone handsets, was up 10.3 per cent to $32.27 as it reported quarterly revenue of $603m and earnings per share of 68 cents, a 4 cent increase on the previous quarter.Terence Whalen, analyst at Citigroup, added the stock to his top picks and said the company was outperforming by winning key contracts from handset manufacturers including Apple rather than because of broad demand for semiconductors.Energy shares underperformed, up 0.4 per cent, after recording strong gains on Tuesday. Shares were led down by domestic oil producing companies.Refiner Tesoro put on 5.9 per cent to $21.30 after Benchmark Company analyst Mark Gilman upgraded the company, and predicted Tesoro will reinstate its 40 cent annual dividend, suspended in 2009.
23;AMAT;Applied Materials;2011-05-25T20:52:38Z;Energy and materials lift Wall Street;;Polo Ralph Lauren led consumer discretionary stocks lower after the retailer reported a sharp drop in quarterly earnings but US indices enjoyed modest gains as firmer commodity prices bolstered the energy and materials sectors.The high-end fashion retailer reported a 36 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profit amid higher costs and lower sales in Japan, sending the stock down 11.4 per cent to $114.70.Ralph Lauren is one in a long line of retailers that have been under pressure in recent months thanks to higher commodity costs squeezing margins and elevated gasoline prices discouraging consumers from splashing out.The S&P retail sector is down 2.6 per cent this month after a number of weak earnings reports from companies such as Gap and Aéropostale.The disappointing news from Ralph Lauren weighed on related stocks, with VF Corp, one of the world’s largest clothing companies, falling 2.1 per cent to $95.54 and JC Penney down 0.7 per cent to $35.86.The S&P consumer goods sector lost 0.7 per cent, the worst performing sector on Wall Street.The main S&P 500 index closed up 0.3 per cent to 1,319.89, led higher by energy and materials stocks as commodity prices rose.In the energy sector, Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, climbed 1 per cent to $84.10 while Halliburton advanced 5 per cent to $49.87.The S&P energy index was up 1.4 per cent, the best performing sector on Wall Street.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 2.4 per cent to $49.98 while Consol Energy, the coal miner, added 2.8 per cent to $49.52. The S&P materials index gained 1.4 per cent.This helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 0.3 per cent to 12,394.66 while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,761.38.Technical factors also helped the wider markets to post gains, after the previous session saw the S&P 500 hit a one-month low and come near a resistance level of 1,315.Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “The S&P 500 continues to trend toward a potential test of the 1,295-1,300 zone with resistance emerging in the 1,315-1,320 area.”Gains on the indices were limited by downbeat economic data, however, with news that US demand for durable goods had sunk more than expected in April.The number of new orders for durable goods fell 3.6 per cent last month, led by a sharp drop in car and aircraft orders.Car orders dropped 4.5 per cent, the sharpest fall since August, as parts shortages following the Japanese earthquake slowed production at US factories.Ford shares fell 0.6 per cent to $14.58 in the session, leading the S&P auto index down 0.5 per cent.Shares in AIG were down 4 per cent to $28.28 after 300m shares in the bailed-out insurer began trading after a secondary offering.The US Treasury sold 200m shares worth $5.8bn while AIG itself sold 100m shares worth $2.9bn.Applied Materials reported forecast-beating second-quarter earnings but rose only 1.1 per cent to $13.86 as the manufacturer of chipmaking equipment forecast an unexpected drop in current-quarter revenue.Applied Materials has fallen 11.7 per cent this month, one of the many technology stocks that have been on a downward trend recently as investors have moved away from riskier assets into more defensive sectors.The S&P technology index has fallen 4.3 per cent this month while Apple has lost 3.8 per cent to $336.78.Citigroup analysts said that, after the recent losses, it was hard to see a lot of downside on Applied Materials shares, although they argued that now was still not quite the right time to buy.Away from the technology sector, shares in Toll Brothers rose 1.8 per cent to $20.63 after the luxury homebuilder reported a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss as sales and margins improved.Hormel Foods, which makes Spam and MegaMex Foods products, fell 4.8 per cent to $28.59 after the company forecast a fall in margins because of rising input prices.Express dropped 12 per cent to $20.12 after the apparel retailer said that its second-quarter earnings would not exceed 15 cents a share, which was below the 16 cents a share that analysts had been expecting.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, fell 5.4 per cent to 16.86 in the session.
24;AMAT;Applied Materials;2011-05-19T21:06:02Z;Economic data offset LinkedIn debt surge;;Shares in LinkedIn more than doubled on their first day of trading following the company’s initial public offering, while the wider markets edged a little higher after a mixed set of data on US employment and manufacturing.The business-focused networking website was up 109.4 per cent to $94.25 after pricing on Wednesday night at $45 a share, which was already at the top-end of its projected range.The stock reached an intraday high of $122.69, up 173 per cent.“This is what I would call a speculative frenzy, and it is not going to end well,” said James Dailey, the chief investment officer at Team Financial Managers.LinkedIn has received a huge amount of attention as the first US social networking and web 2.0 company to go public, ahead of its Facebook, retail services company Groupon and social games service Zynga.Many commentators have been asking whether the lofty valuations put on some of these point to the emergence of a technology bubble, akin to the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s.“This is a very rich valuation, which is reminiscent, to say the least, of the year 2000 exuberance,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief investment strategist at YCMNET Advisors, a wealth management firm.But Mr Dailey said it was too early to talk about a bubble in the technology sector. “There has been a bubble in the use of the word bubble,” he said.The strong first day from LinkedIn had little impact on the wider technology sector, however, which was led lower in the session by chipmakers after Goldman Sachs cut its view on the sector from “neutral” to “cautious”.The investment bank’s rating on Intel was reduced from “neutral” to “sell” sending shares in the chipmaker down 1.4 per cent to $23.54.Applied Materials, which was also downgraded, lost 1.2 per cent to $14.33 while Nvidia fell 1.4 per cent to $17.78.That left the Philadelphia Semiconductor index down 0.9 per cent and S&P technology index up 0.1 per cent.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 added 0.2 per cent to 1,343.50 after better-than-expected employment data outweighed a disappointing number from the Philadelphia Fed on manufacturing.Employment numbers showed that the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits had fallen by 29,000 last week to 409,000, lower than the 420,000 economists had been expecting. But the figure was still above the 400,000 mark, which is the point at which economists conclude the economy is adding jobs.But the Philadelphia Fed’s reading on mid-Atlantic manufacturing activity tumbled to 3.9, indicating very little expansion. This was a sharp fall from the 18.5 reading in April and lower than the 20 points that economists had been expecting.“There is still some worry that labour market gains may be faltering a bit,” said Joshua Shapiro chief US economist at MFR.Separately, data showed that sales in previously occupied homes had fallen slightly in April, in another sign that the US housing market remained depressed.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4 per cent at 12,603.81 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.3 per cent higher at 2,823.24.The retail sector was again in focus after another raft of mixed earnings reports and the S&P retail index was down 0.1 per cent.Shares in Advance Auto Parts fell 10.2 per cent to $63.48 after the spare-part retailer’s earnings missed analysts forecasts.The company said earnings in the first quarter were $1.35 a share on $109.6m, short of the $1.38 a share expected.Sears Holdings was down 2.6 per cent to $73.86 after the retailer reported a disappointing loss in the first quarter.The owner of Sears and Kmart posted a net loss of $170m, or $1.58 a share, compared with a net profit of $16m, or 14 cents a share, in the same period in 2010Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, lost 3.9 per cent to $40.80 after reporting slightly better than expected earnings, but giving a current-quarter forecast that fell short of expectations.Dollar Tree, the discount retailer, saw a 59 per cent jump in first-quarter profit, exceeding expectations and sending shares in the company up 2.9 per cent to $63.11.Big Lots, another discount retailer, was down 10.6 per cent to $33.74 following reports that it had decided not to put itself up for sale.
25;AMAT;Applied Materials;2011-05-04T23:18:23Z;Intel claims 3D chip revolution;;Intel has claimed the biggest breakthrough in microprocessor design in more than 50 years, raising the stakes significantly for rivals in the increasingly capital-intensive global chip industry.The world’s biggest chipmaker said on Wednesday that it would begin producing chips this year using a revolutionary 3D technology that has been nearly a decade in the making, and which it said would act as the foundation for generations of computing advances to come.Microchip transistors, the building blocks of electronics, have to date been produced in flat structures – akin to printing on a sheet of paper. Intel’s breakthrough involves producing more complex three dimensional transistors on chips.The new technology is one of Intel’s biggest gambles in the race to maintain and even extend its long-standing lead over other chipmakers in making components smaller and faster, while breathing fresh life into the remorseless cycle of chip improvements on which the modern computing and electronics industries are founded.The impact of Intel’s attempt to push ahead of the rest of the industry was felt more widely on Wednesday, as Applied Materials, which supplies Intel with manufacturing equipment, announced a $4.9bn acquisition to keep up with the new technology.The US equipment maker said it would buy Varian Semiconductor Equipment for $4.9bn to give it the capability to handle chips of greater complexity than those whose circuits are only 22 billionths of a metre wide – the scale at which Intel said it would begin manufacturing before the end of this year.Intel called its new chip design the most significant advance since the introduction in the 1950s of the transistor, the fundamental building block in electronics. It said the breakthrough would also extend Moore’s Law – the accurate 1965 prediction by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of transistors on a chip could be doubled roughly every two years.That exponential rise in processing power has formed the basis for the steady advances in electronics since, though many in the industry fear that the chipmakers are approaching the limits of their ability to continue the improvements.“For years we have seen limits to how small transistors can get, this change in the basic structure is a truly revolutionary approach,” said Mr Moore in a statement.“Amazing, world-shaping devices will be created from this capability as we advance Moore’s Law into new realms,” said Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive.Martin Reynolds, of the Gartner research firm, said: “Its a big deal, they seem to be well ahead of the rest of the industry. At the low end, the chips can help make mobile devices that need less power and at the high end they can make servers more powerful …this could help persuade the industry to use Intel’s chips.”Applied Materials announced that its agreement to acquire Massachusetts-based Varian for $63 per share in cash – a 55 per cent premium to its closing price on Tuesday – was aimed at helping it solve the problems of ever increasing chip complexity, transistor scaling and 3-D designs.Shares in Intel closed up 1.95 per cent to $23.50.
26;AMAT;Applied Materials;2011-05-04T21:51:22Z;Energy leads further Wall Street retreat;;"US indices retreated further from multiyear highs achieved last week after disappointing economic data, softer commodity prices and a number of lacklustre earnings reports.The sharpest falls came from the energy sector, with National Oilwell Varco, the oilfield services company, falling 3.4 per cent to $69.92 and Cameron International losing 4.1 per cent to $48.70.ExxonMobil, the largest company in the world by market capitalisation, was down 0.9 per cent to $84.81 as the oil price fell back. The S&P energy index was off 1.6 per cent.“The fall in commodity prices should eventually be a good thing for the markets but in the meantime it is weighing heavily on the energy and material sectors,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.Energy stocks had led the rally in US equities over the past six months.Since the end of September, the S&P energy index has risen 49 per cent while the broader S&P 500 index is up 28.5 per cent.But this pattern has started to change in the past few weeks, with April the first month in almost a year where energy stocks did not outperform the benchmark S&P 500 index.The S&P energy index is down 1.2 per cent this month.Material stocks also lost ground in the session. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, fell 3.9 per cent to $51.14 while Cliff Natural Resources lost 4.1 per cent to $87.55. The S&P materials sector was down 1.7 per cent.These losses left the S&P 500 index down 0.7 per cent to 1,347.32 at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also 0.7 per cent softer at 12,723.12, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,828.23.Weak economic data weighed on sentiment across the wider markets, leaving all of the major S&P sectoral indices trading lower.The biggest disappointment was over the ISM non-manufacturing composite index, which plunged to 52.8 in April from 57.3 the previous month in a worrying sign of the rate of growth in the US services sector. However, a reading above 50 still indicates expansion.Separately, employment data from Automatic Data Processing estimated that the private sector had added 179,000 jobs in April, below the 200,000 economists had expected. The ADP data is significant as it is the first in a slew of crucial employment numbers to be released this week.The big event will be on Friday, when the official, monthly non-farm payroll numbers are set to be released, but before that there are the weekly numbers on Thursday.Some weak earnings results also kept market sentiment lower. Las Vegas Sands fell 7.4 per cent to $42.50 after the casino resort operator missed analysts’ earnings and revenue forecasts.Elsewhere, Kellogg, the cereal company, reported a 12 per cent drop in earnings and slimmer gross margins for the first quarter, sending its shares down 1.2 per cent to $56.78. Investors reacted negatively to the news as the maker of Rice Krispies and Pop-Tarts became the latest in a long line of companies to feel rising commodity costs.Last week, Procter & Gamble said it had underestimated commodity inflation in “a very difficult operating environment”.Kimberly-Clark and Nike have also reported weaker results this season thanks to higher commodity prices.In deal news, Applied Materials, the US semiconductor equipment maker, announced plans to buy rival Varian Semiconductor in a $4.9bn cash deal. The news sent shares in Varian up 51.3 per cent to $61.36, while Applied Materials lost 1 per cent to $15.09.Elsewhere, ConAgra Foods announced it had made a $4.9bn cash offer to acquireRalcorp, the cereal maker, in a deal that would make ConAgra the third-largest US packaged foods company by revenues.This sent shares in Ralcorp up 4.9 per cent to $87.39 while ConAgra Foods added 3.1 per cent to $25.51.Renren, China’s leading real-name social networking service, saw its shares surge 28.6 per cent to $18.01 on its trading debut in New York.The Beijing-based company, which is unlisted in China, had priced its initial public offering at $14 per share to raise $743m, at the top of its projected range
of $12-$14."
27;AMAT;Applied Materials;2011-05-04T18:27:11Z;Applied: will takeover spark innovation?;The crucial question is whether new and better products result from Varian deal;Talk is cheap. Earnings accretion is free. US tech companies have heaps of zero-yielding cash and access to cheap debt. Given this, any company that acquires a profitable competitor, but fails to show a bump in earnings per share, needs to fire its chief financial officer.On Wednesday, semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials announced an agreed purchase of Varian Semiconductor. It is paying up. The premium is 40 per cent above Varian’s 30-day average undisturbed price. Applied trades at a price-to-prospective earnings ratio of 10 times and is paying 16 times for Varian. Nonetheless, Applied expects 8 per cent earnings per share accretion in the first year. Certainly, Varian is a high-quality asset. It controls three-quarters of a sub-segment that is growing ahead of the industry, and where Applied no longer participates – partly because Applied had been outflanked by Varian in that niche.Still, Applied sees $1.7bn of value in Varian that the market didn’t. It is pencilling in $50m-$60m in immediate annual cost cuts, but whichever way you tax and capitalise that – and even if you expect savings to grow from there – investors are not getting to $1.7bn.Might revenue synergies make up the difference? In the Texas Instruments-National Semiconductor deal announced in April, the promised top-line jump is to come mostly from pushing the target’s products through the buyer’s massive salesforce. That could work for analogue semiconductors, but semiconductor capital equipment sales are technology rather than salesforce driven. So the crucial question is whether combining the technologies and engineers of Applied and Varian will lead to new and better products.Given the sophistication of the technologies involved, the number of people who can predict whether the combination will spark innovation is very small.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
28;AMAT;Applied Materials;2011-05-04T14:42:49Z;Applied Materials to buy Varian for $4.9bn;;Applied Materials, the US semiconductor equipment maker, plans to buy rival Varian Semiconductor in a $4.9bn cash deal.California-based Applied Materials said the deal would give it access to new technology needed for the fast-growing smartphone and solar equipment markets.The $63 a share purchase is at a 55.4 per cent premium to Varian’s closing share price of $40.55 on Tuesday.Applied Materials supplies equipment needed to make photovoltaic solar panels, having diversified from its original semiconductor manufacturing business in the middle of the last decade.Massachusetts-based Varian is a leading supplier of equipment that implants ions on to the silicon discs that are cut into chips. Ion implantation is one of the ways in which electrical circuits are created onto semiconductor chips Applied Materials said Varian’s technology allowed customers to lower costs and improve efficiency. A combined business would also be able to extend ion implantation technology into the solar power market.“In addition to our combined strengths in the semiconductor space, Applied’s proven capability to extend its technology to adjacent markets like solar and display can help unlock the tremendous potential of ion implantation in these markets,” said Gary Dickerson, Varian’s chief executive.Many Silicon Valley chip companies have shifted to serving the solar power market in hopes of tapping into growing demand for clean energy and US stimulus funding. However, they have struggled to perfect new manufacturing techniques and compete with producers in China.Varian this week reported strong financial results, with revenues for the first half of the year up 79 per cent at $572.7m.Shares in Varian surged 51.4 per cent to $61.40 in pre-market trade on Wednesday, while Applied Materials rose 9 cents to $15.24.
29;AMAT;Applied Materials;2011-03-21T20:55:01Z;Wall St rises as fears over Japan ease;;The telecommunications sector was shaken by news that AT&T will buy T-Mobile USA, while elsewhere on Wall Street sentiment improved as concerns over Japan’s nuclear crisis eased.AT&T announced on Sunday that it was buying T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom for $39bn in a deal that will create the largest wireless carrier in the US. Shares in AT&T were up 1.2 per cent to $28.26.The news sent Sprint Nextel, the No 3 US carrier, tumbling 13.6 per cent to $4.36. Sprint was itself in talks with Deutsche Telekom to merge with T-Mobile, and this surprise deal with AT&T pulled the rug out from underneath it.The telecoms sector as a whole had a mixed reaction to the news. Verizon Communications, the second-largest US telecoms group by revenues, was up 1.7 per cent to $36.46 but Qwest Communications International fell 3.4 per cent to $6.69. Overall, The S&P telecommunications index was down 0.2 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 closed up 1.5 per cent to 1,298.38, aided by news over the weekend that engineers had managed to cool down some of the reactors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5 per cent to 12,036.53, up 3.6 per cent in the last three sessions, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.8 per cent to 2,692.09. The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, was down 15.2 per cent in the session, although it is still up 25.7 since its mid-February lows before the turmoil began in north Africa and the Middle East.The improving situation in Japan lifted some insurance stocks as worries eased somewhat over the extent of their liabilities. Hartford Financial Services Group was up 3.9 per cent to $26.49 while American International Group added 6 per cent to $37.03.The gains for AIG came despite an announcement that its bill for the damage caused by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami will be at least $700m.The KBW property casualty index was up 1.6 per cent, paring some of the 2 per cent losses last week.Semiconductor stocks also rose as fears over supply constraints resulting from the Japan disaster receded. “Our most recent checks suggest the supply worst-case scenario likely has been averted,” wrote analysts at Citigroup.Applied Materials was up 2.5 per cent to $15.21 while Cirrus Logic added 4.9 per cent to $20.95.Qualcomm, the world’s largest producer of mobile-phone chips, rose 3.7 per cent to $53.63, also helped by news that Sterne Agee & Leach had raised its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “buy”.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index was up 1.8 per cent, bouncing back from the 2 per cent loss seen last week.The industrial sector rallied from its 1.7 per cent loss last week as Japanese tensions eased. General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, added 2.4 per cent to $19.72 while 3M put on 2.2 per cent to $90.95.The previous week saw heavy volatility on fears of a nuclear catastrophe in Japan. In the first three days, the S&P 500 lost 3.2 per cent and the Vix volatility index spiked up 46.4 per cent. The markets then rallied somewhat on Thursday and Friday to close only 1.9 per cent lower over the week.Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial said that markets had been trying to get “back to normal” on Friday but were constrained as traders worried about potential bad news over the weekend.“When nothing major happened in Japan over the weekend, the upward momentum was able to take over and lift equities on Monday,” said Mr Warren.Energy stocks benefited from an oil price jump in the session following the bombing of Libya over the weekend and warnings from Muammer Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, of a “long, drawn-out war”.Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, was up 4.4 per cent to $89.72 while Marathon Oil added 4.4 per cent to $51.84. The wider markets appeared unperturbed by the rise in energy prices.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Tiffany & Co was up 5.1 per cent to $60.22 after reporting fourth-quarter profits up 29 per cent, beating market expectations.The jewellery group, which gets 18 per cent of its revenue from Japan, fell 9.3 per cent last week following the disaster.

The Fed chairman said sustained higher oil prices “would represent a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability, particularly if they were to cause inflation expectations to become less well anchored”.He also gave no indication of any further measures to stimulate the economy, which some traders had been hoping for.Any positive sentiment was further dashed as oil prices spiked higher on concerns that the unrest sweeping across north Africa and the Middle East might spread to Saudi Arabia.In the first three trading sessions of last week, the S&P fell 2.8 per cent on similar concerns. These worries damped risk appetite in the US and around the world, causing material stocks to dive lower.Titanium Metals was down 6.2 per cent to $17.82 while AK Steel was 4.7 per cent lower at $15.23. The S&P materials sector was down 2.3 per cent.Consumer services stocks were also depressed by the higher oil price and comments by Mr Bernanke.Carnival, the world’s largest cruise ship operator, was down 6.1 per cent to $40.08 while Priceline.com, the online travel company, lost 1.9 per cent to $445.29.But promising economic data helped limit the losses on Wall Street.Figures from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the US manufacturing sector had seen strong growth in February.The index rose from 60.8 in January to 61, which is the highest reading since 2004. A number over 50 on the index indicates that the sector is growing.In earnings news, AutoZone, a retailer of car parts, reported earnings up 20 per cent and same-store sales up by 7.1 per cent. The stock added 2.2 per cent to $263.52.But that failed to lift related stocks. O’Reilly Automotive was down 0.8 per cent to $55.15 while Advance Auto Parts was 0.1 per cent lower at $62.63.There were some signs that the tide might be turning for car part retailers, which have profited since the financial crisis on people’s reluctance to buy new cars.General Motors reported that its sales had jumped 46 per cent in February from the same period a year ago due, primarily to a rise in demand from retail customers.The Buick and Cadillac car brands reported sales up by 73 per cent and 70 per cent, respectively.GM shares were down 1.7 per cent to $32.95, however, as the sales figures failed to impress investors.Separately, Ford reported that its sales had risen 14 per cent. Its stock was 2.6 per cent lower at $14.66.Elsewhere, Las Vegas Sands, the casino resort company, fell 6.3 per cent to $43.70 after reporting that it was being investigated by the SEC and the Department of Justice over its compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Lorillard, which primarily makes menthol cigarettes, was up 1.6 per cent to $78.98 after the US Food and Drugs Agency said evidence was “insufficient” that smoking menthol cigarettes is riskier than normal cigarettes.Tower Group, the insurance provider, was down 12.6 per cent to $23.76 after its 2011 earnings view fell short of analyst estimates.Sonus Networks was up 33.3 per cent to $4.16 after the internet telecoms company reported fourth-quarter profit up 11 per cent and issued a revenue guidance that surpassed expectations.
31;AMAT;Applied Materials;2011-02-25T21:57:59Z;Boeing soars on $35bn US tanker contract;;Boeing had strong gains after winning a lucrative government contract while equities bounced back in the wider markets after three days of sharp losses.The defence group triumphed over its arch-rival EADS to win a $35bn contract to build 179 new airborne refuelling tankers for the US air force, sending its shares up 2.2 per cent to $72.30.These aircraft will replace only a portion of the US tanker fleet so direct follow-on awards could bring the total value of the programme up to $100bn.The S&P 500 closed up 1.1 per cent to 1,319.88, snapping a three-day losing streak, as oil prices stabilised and traders took the opportunity to re-enter a heavily sold market.But the S&P 500 was still down 1.7 per cent over the week on worries that sustained high prices as a result of the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East could slow down the domestic economic recovery.This was the largest weekly fall on the index since November.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was down 9.7 per cent in the session but is still up 16.9 per cent over the week.The Vix spiked up 26.6 per cent on Tuesday, the biggest one-day rise since the depths of the Greek sovereign debt crisis in May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,130.45 while the Nasdaq Composite closed 1 per cent higher to 2,781.05, the biggest gain in three weeks. The indices lost 2.1 per cent and 1.9 per cent, respectively, over the five days.Stocks in the materials sector were prominent among those rebounding on Friday as the S&P materials index was up 1.4 per cent, recovering slightly from the 4.4 per cent loss earlier in the week.Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s biggest copper miner by market capitalisation, was up 1.1 per cent to $52.45.Financials also bounced back. The S&P financials index was 1.4 per cent higher after falling 3.2 per cent earlier in the week.Wells Fargo was up 3.1 per cent to $32.40 while Bank of America added 1.7 per cent to $14.20.In the financial sector, American International Group lost ground after releasing disappointing earnings numbers.The insurer reported fourth-quarter earnings of $11.2bn but this included the proceeds from the initial public offering of Asia unit AIA Group and the sale of American Life Insurance Company.Without these, the group would have lost $2.2bn in the quarter. Shares in AIG retreated 4.7 per cent to $38.54.Positive consumer confidence data also helped to lift sentiment on Wall Street.The Michigan Consumer Sentiment index put on 3.3 points to 77.5, which was ahead of the 74.2 expected by economists and the highest level for three years. However, the second reading of the fourth-quarter GDP numbers came in slightly below expectation, limiting a greater market rally.The Commerce Department showed that GDP had grown by 2.8 per cent annualised in the fourth quarter, below the initial estimates of 3.2 per cent.In other earnings news, Applied Materials reported earnings of 36 cents per share in the first quarter, ahead of the 33 cents per share figure estimated by analysts. This left shares in the semiconductor equipment group up 1.8 per cent to $16.12.JC Penney, the retailer, reported fourth-quarter earnings up 36 per cent and gave a stronger-than-expected full-year earnings forecast.But this failed to impress the markets and its stock lost 6.5 per cent to $34.16.Following a national holiday on Monday, Wall Street began the trading week on Tuesday with its sharpest one-day fall on the S&P 500 in six months.Markets around the world had tumbled on Monday as violence in Libya escalated and oil supplies were disrupted, leaving Wall Street with some catching up to do. When the markets did open, the S&P 500 tumbled 2.1 per cent while the Vix index rose to a 2½-month high.Markets continued to fall on Wednesday and Thursday primarily due to the geopolitical tensions but they were not helped by weak earnings results from Walmart, Hewlett-Packard and General Motors.Walmart was down 6.6 per cent on the week to $51.75 while Hewlett-Packard lost 12.3 per cent to $42.68. General Motors declined 8.9 per cent to $33.25.Energy stocks gained throughout the week as oil prices rose to nearly $120 a barrel before easing back to $112.
32;AMAT;Applied Materials;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Summers’ departure opens door for new ideas;Exit offers Obama opportunity for intellectual liberation;Henry Kissinger once suggested that Lawrence Summers, Barack Obama’s outgoing economic adviser, should be hired by the White House solely to shoot down bad ideas. In a few weeks, Mr Summers will move back to Harvard where he will be able to think up good ideas without having to second guess what the political traffic will bear.Given that Congress appears to have abandoned any pretence of a serious debate on what needs to be done to restore America’s declining economic competitiveness, the move will doubtless come as an intellectual liberation for Mr Summers. The bigger question is whether Mr Summers’ departure offers Mr Obama his own opportunity for intellectual liberation.There is barely an economist in the world who would deny that Mr Summers has a bigger brain than they do. Nor, in spite of valid criticisms of how the politics has been conducted, would most dispute the fact that the Obama administration’s handling of the bank bail-out and fiscal stimulus was indispensable to preventing another Great Depression. Mr Summers was the architect.These are high marks. Yet many of Mr Summers’ very same admirers have also become his detractors. Put simply, they see him as the face of a paradigm that has outlived its usefulness – the view that globalisation is an unmixed blessing for the US economy, and that America’s disappearing manufacturing jobs will be replaced by high-value jobs in the service sector. Things do not appear to be working out that way.Take Applied Materials, a big US manufacturing company, which earlier this year shifted its chief technology officer and research and development operations to China. The company said it needed its R&D to be close to the source of its manufacturing operations and to its biggest future market. This is the opposite of what is supposed to happen. America was meant to keep the high-end jobs at home, while China would get all the low-value added production.But in practice researchers benefit from proximity to the production processes, which require constant trial and error. A cursory look at the US’s trade deficit illustrates the trend. Far from importing low cost manufactured goods, the US is buying high-tech stuff from such countries as China and Brazil, including aircraft engines, computers, turbines and heavy duty trucks. And it is exporting growing volumes of low-tech stuff, including pulp and paper, oil seeds and other commodities. People who lose their jobs in the US are on average moving to jobs that pay roughly a fifth less than their previous jobs. Others are having difficulty finding any jobs at all.That trend has only been accelerated by the Great Recession. According to Manufacturing and Technology News, the number of US workers displaced by US trade policy rose by 59 per cent in 2009 over 2008, thus qualifying for special benefits from the US Department of Labor. The same publication reports that the US now accounts for less than 5 per cent of global solar panel production despite the fact that it invented the technology in the 1980s.The direction is hard to deny. America is not producing new jobs in anything like the quality or the quantity it needs to replace the high-end jobs it is losing. Mr Summers’ exit therefore offers Mr Obama an unusually important chance to think radically about the kind of economic legacy he wishes to leave.Speculation has focused on whether Mr Obama will choose somebody from the business community to counter the growing distemper corporate America feels towards his administration. It has also focused on whether the job will be taken by a woman. Ann Mulcahy, the former chief executive of Xerox, has been mentioned as has Laura Tyson, who held the job in the 1990s.A bolder choice would be Jeff Immelt, the chief executive of GE, who is one of the few corporate leaders to have worried openly about America’s declining competitiveness. As the head of a company that has done as much offshoring as any, Mr Immelt knows what is driving the reduction of America’s productive capacity. Presumably, therefore, he would have some ideas about how to reverse it. Somebody must.
33;AMAT;Applied Materials;2010-07-22T03:14:16Z;Applied Materials reveals retrenchment;;Applied Materials, a supplier to solar power plant manufacturers, on Wednesday exposed a retrenchment in parts of the industry with the closure of its thin-film product line at a cost of up to $425m.The US group, which supplies equipment needed to make photovoltaic solar panels, said it would no longer supply manufacturing lines to companies that use thin-film solar technology, a field that had been seen as a promising area of renewable power.Start-up groups working on thin film were at the heart of a boom in venture capital investment in alternative energy and other “clean tech” areas in 2007 and 2008.Thin-film technology can achieve a higher power-conversion rate than older photovoltaic techniques, turning more sunlight into power.But higher costs and the difficulty of perfecting new manufacturing techniques have plagued the field.Expansion of solar plants in China using older but more proven technologies has seen a shift in the industry’s focus to Asia.Applied Materials’ diversification in the middle of the last decade into solar equipment manufacturing, to complement its chip equipment business, was one of the earliest signs of the Silicon Valley technology industry refocusing on “clean tech” markets.On Wednesday, the group blamed a number of factors for pulling back, including the problems that solar manufacturers have had in raising the capital needed to develop their own plants.The solar industry in the US had hoped stimulus spending and government guarantees would alleviate some of the problems caused by the debt crisis that took hold in late 2008, but that has not made up for market retrenchment.Some investors were predicting a shake-out in thin film before the financial crisis, given the high level of start-up investment in an unproven field.Applied Materials also pointed to a delay in the adoption of large-scale solar plants by electricity utilities for its decision to pull back, along with “changes and uncertainty” in government policies.In spite of ending its thin-film product line, the group said it would continue to invest in thin-film technology research and development and would keep a China research centre open.The pull-back was expected to lead to a charge against earnings of $375m-$425m, it said.

Values below 20 generally correspond to less volatile markets.“The Vix has closed down 16 out of the last 18 sessions – we haven’t seen it do that in such a consistent manner since 1997. [The low level] suggests that the Vix is not fully reflecting the amount of risk in the market right now,” said Mr Golden.Insurer AIG gained 3.6 per cent to $29.10 after agreeing to sell its American Life Insurance unit, one of its overseas insurance operations, to MetLife, a US life assurer, for $15.5bn.

US producer prices also rose faster than expected in January, partly because higher gas prices and cold weather boosted overall energy prices.Wall Street, however, shrugged off most of the negative sentiment surrounding the day’s news and closed up for the third consecutive session. The S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to 1,106.75, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 10,392.90 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7 per cent to 2,241.71.However, S&P 500 futures fell around 7.8 per cent in extended hours in reaction to the Fed’s decision to raise the discount rate it charges banks for emergency loans to 0.75 per cent from 0.50 per cent.Walmart shares lost 1.1 per cent to $53.47 following disappointing fourth-quarter results. The world’s largest retailer by sales recorded comparable-store sales that trailed estimates. Mike Duke, Walmart chief executive, said he expected US sales to be “more challenging” in the first quarter.Some analysts questioned whether the disappointing figures showed that more consumers were trading up, citing Tuesday’s strong results from Whole Foods as evidence, or whether consumers were just spending less.The technology sector was also in focus following the release of a number of quarterly results.Hewlett-Packard gained 1.4 per cent to $50.81. Its first-quarter results, posted after the market’s close on Wednesday, comfortably beat estimates. The company also raised guidance for the year.Analysts said HP was well-placed to gain from an expected rise in technology spending as businesses replace ageing equipment.Rival Dell was set to report its latest results after the session’s close. Its shares were up 2.3 per cent to $14.43.Applied Materials, a semiconductor maker, dropped 2.4 per cent to $12.68 as its net income figures narrowly fell short of estimates. The target price was cut from $14 to $12 by

36;AMAT;Applied Materials;2010-01-28T19:21:57Z;Semiconductor equipment;;Reality always intrudes in the end. That’s why stock markets so often buy rumours and sell facts, moving immediately on to the next set of imagined events. So evidence filtering through of the true extent of recovery does not bode well for a faltering market rally – the FTSE World has fallen 5 per cent during the past 10 days. The semiconductor equipment sector, one of the world’s more volatile and cyclical businesses, is a case in point.Companies such as Applied Materials of the US and Europe’s ASML – which make the machines chip companies use to turn silicon wafers into tiny circuit boards – should be in for a good year. Chipmakers began cutting back in late 2008 in response to overcapacity and the recession. A year ago more than half of manufacturing capacity was still idle. But capacity utilisation had risen to 80 per cent by the end of last year, estimates iSuppli, and is expected to rise further. After three consecutive years of decline, industry consultants forecast global spending on machinery by chipmakers to rise a vigorous 47 per cent this year.However, stock prices have already anticipated recovery. With Applied Materials up by half, and ASML more than doubling, the sector has been on a tear since late 2008. Yet their customers have a tendency to overinvest and then suffer the consequences. Tool shipments are running at a rate suggesting annual semiconductor capital spending of $40bn to $50bn, a level that has tended to cause meaningful rises of chip manufacturing capacity in the past.Meanwhile, the recession was sharp but not necessarily long enough to leave a big backlog of demand for manufacturing equipment. Citigroup calculates that customer spending fell below maintenance levels for just over a year. By comparison, spending fell below for twice as long in the recession that began in late 2001.

37;AMAT;Applied Materials;2009-12-14T09:21:06Z;Solar technology;;One hope of those talking about climate change in Copenhagen is that solar panels will eventually be cheap enough to compete unsubsidised with fossil fuels. As the semiconductor industry was inspired by Moore’s law to make computer chips tiny, powerful and ubiquitous, it’s thought that technology and competition might work a similar magic for photovoltaic cells. Indeed, semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials has started pushing into thin film solar equipment. And last week Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, took a 20 per cent stake in solar company Motech Industries for $193m. Both suggest that industrial cross fertilisation might be about to begin.Yet the similarities between chips and panels are only superficial. Both involve silicon and electricity. They also share some processing technology. But solar is a much simpler process, with very high production volumes. A typical plant will churn out 3,000 silicon wafers every hour, with each wafer forming one solar cell. A reasonably sized semiconductor foundry, by comparison, might produce only 200,000 wafers in a year. It is a business of minute precision, given that one wafer can yield 100,000 chips.Routes to improved efficiency also differ. In chips, it is largely a question of better design. For solar panels, it most often happens by procuring raw materials more cheaply. One reason why margins at solar panel producers are so poor is that many locked in silicon supplies when prices were high last year.Chipmaking demands heavy capital spending. As few companies have deployed it in ways that create value, it is unlikely they will have more success with solar power.The two markets are also quite different. Former aerospace executive Alan Mulally may have done well to keep Ford out of bankruptcy. But that does not mean Boeing would be good at making cars.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 10,437.42 and the Nasdaq also edged 0.3 per cent higher to 2,203.78.Soaring oil prices lifted US stocks on Monday to close at their highest level since October last year.But the consumer discretionary sector weighed on the market on Tuesday after retailers remained cautious about the upcoming holiday season.Home Depot, the largest home improvement chain in the US, reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year outlook on Tuesday after fighting to cut costs in the face of weaker demand. The shares fell 2.4 per cent to $26.99 after the retailer warned the housing market was still under pressure. The sector has been badly hit in the recession because homeowners have spent less on their existing properties and the frozen housing market has reduced the need for renovation projects.On Monday, Lowe’s, the second-largest player in the sector, had posted a 30 per cent decline in profits and said it did not expect a market recovery to start until the middle of next year.“The numbers were pretty decent but the problem for the market is that there are a lot of high expectations,” said Brett Hawkins, portfolio manager at Thompson, Siegel & Walmsley.“The underlying problem is that total credit is still contracting and we’re recovering off a really low base. To get people to really drive the market higher from here there has to
be some evidence that
we’re really reflating as an economy.”Target, the second-largest discount retailer in the US, also reported third-quarter results that beat analysts’ expectations. However, the shares fell 3 per cent to $48.77 after the group said it remained cautious about the upcoming few months.At the other end of the consumer market, Saks, the upmarket department store chain, swung to a net profit after analysts had been expecting continuing losses.While cost-cutting was the main reason for the reversal in the retailer’s fortunes, the company said it had also seen customers starting to spend more in the jewellery and women’s designer sportswear departments. Its shares were up 4.1 per cent to $6.67.Dillard’s, the department store chain based in Texas and Florida, also returned to the black in the third quarter thanks to a tax benefit and cost cutting. Analysts had forecast worse results and the shares rose 8.9 per cent at $14.51.Jacobs Engineering the country’s second-largest publicly traded engineering company, reported a bigger drop in quarterly profit than expected.The group said it had suffered from the cancellation of one big oil and gas project. Its shares fell 14.5 per cent to $38.88.Jacobs’ results added to the pessimism in the sector after data showed industrial production in October was lower than expected.Smith International, the oilfield contractor, lost 12.7 per cent to $26.89 after offering 28m shares in an effort to pay back debt and fund acquisitions. The company has suffered from a sharp decline in the US natural gas market, prompting it to cut almost one fifth of its workforce. Profits during the third quarter fell
97 per cent, the group said last month.Playboy shareholders suffered some of the biggest losses. Shares in the magazine publisher slid 14.2 per cent to $4.10 after Linda Havard, the company’s chief financial officer, resigned late on Monday.Applied Materials, the world’s biggest tool provider for the semiconductor industry, agreed to buy Semitool for $364m in cash.It said the acquisition would allow it to produce smaller and more powerful chips for use in smartphones and notebook computers. Semitool shares rose 31.2 per cent to $11.02 but Applied Materials slipped 0.9 per cent to $12.94.Shares in Palm, which produces smartphones, rose 5.8 per cent to $12.54 after Kaufman Bros upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold”."
39;AMAT;Applied Materials;2009-11-13T18:27:23Z;Investors switch back on to tech stocks;;Fund managers who invest in technology and telecoms stocks are sounding increasingly positive about the sector’s prospects compared with other parts of the market.There is widespread belief that the tech sector has “grown up” since the IT bubble was pricked in March 2000. “We managed to get rid of a lot of the rubbish from 2001 through 2003,” says James Gautrey, a technology and telecoms specialist with Schroders. “Some of the companies in existence back then are still here today and I think – by and large – they do still make fairly interesting investments.”These arguments are supported by the fact that tech and telecoms companies’ balance sheets appear strong while their share prices do not look over overvalued on fundamental measures. Many stocks trade on price-to-earnings ratios as low as 10-13 times next year’s earnings.“We believe that many companies in the sector are now in much better shape than several years ago with cash on their balance sheets and valuations that do not look excessive, yet the area remains unloved,” says John Chatfeild-Roberts, head of the Jupiter Independent Funds team.With $30bn in net cash, Microsoft is the sector’s titan. It trades at 16 times forward earnings and yesterday its shares still hovered at less than $30.Schroders’ Gautrey says the company could yet generate a further $18bn to $20bn in yearly net cash, thanks partly to the launch of Windows 7.Tyco Electronics, which trades at about $24 per share, is another favourite of Gautrey who believes its efforts to cut costs and restructure will improve its margins. He also favours Baidu, dubbed China’s Google, and Applied Materials, the US semiconductor group. Now trading at $12.82, Applied Material’s shares have risen about 25 per cent in the last year.A wave of mergers and acquisitions could also boost the sector as more tech companies look to “cross-sell” products.Andrew Williamson Jones, manager of BlackRock’s Global Equity fund, is bullish on telecoms as many stocks offer free cash flow yield of 10 per cent or more and have pared back costs. The chance to earn dividends is another incentive to buy into the sector as yields on telecom stocks are outpacing those of 10-year gilts and US Treasuries.Vodafone, Verizon and AT&T all offer yields of 6 per cent or more while France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom’s yearly payouts are in the 8 to 9 per cent range. “In the rally of the last six months, telecom stocks have been left behind and now trade at a significant discount to the market,” says Williamson Jones.But some advisers encourage clients to gain exposure to tech stocks via general equity funds. “I wouldn’t select a separate tech fund,” says Tim Cockerill, head of research with Rowan & Co, the advisory firm.

Data showing a steeper drop in claims for unemployment benefits for unemployment benefits than had been expected lifted confidence.But crude oil inventory readings, revealing a surprise increase in stockpiles, weighed on the market.After dipping in and out of the red in early trading, the S&P 500 declined steadily towards the end of the session, closing 1 per cent lower at 1,087.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.9 per cent to 10,197.47 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8 per cent to 2,149.02.“Every time the S&P has approached 1,100, it seems to hit a wall but one of these days it’s going to blow right through that number and may not look back for a while,” said Howard Ward, portfolio manager of Gamco Growth Fund. “There’s so much cash on the sidelines that people who have been missing the rally are beginning to panic.”Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, reported quarterly profit above expectations due to aggressive cost-cutting.The group also said it had gained market share in the US, the UK and Mexico.However, its forecast for the fourth quarter was at the lower end of analyst estimates. Its shares gained 0.5 per cent to $53.24.Kohl’s, the fourth-largest department store chain in the US, reported higher-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter, lifting the company’s shares just 0.1 per cent to $54.64.Like Walmart, the retailer also gave a more cautious outlook for the imminent holiday period than Wall Street had been expecting.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, shares in Green Mountain Coffee fell 10 per cent to $68.35 after the Vermont-based roaster forecast first-quarter earnings below analyst estimates. However, the shares were still up more than 160 per cent from last year due, in part, to Walmart’s agreement to stock the brand and the continued appeal of premium coffee in the downturn.The technology sector gave one of the day’s best performances after a spurt of deal activity.After the closing bell on Wednesday, Hewlett-Packard announced that it had struck a deal to buy 3Com for $2.7bn in cash, presenting a significant challenge to its rival Cisco Systems.The acquisition is set to make HP, already the largest personal computer maker, a stronger player in Cisco’s core market of networking gear.HP shares lost 0.6 per cent to $49.70 while 3Com surged 31.1 per cent to $7.46. Meanwhile, Cisco slipped 2.2 per cent to $23.40.Reports had previously suggested HP would buy Brocade Communication Systems, another manufacturer of networking gear.News of the deal with 3Com prompted analysts to cut their ratings on Brocade, causing the shares to drop 12.7 per cent to $8.08.Chipmakers Intel and Advanced Micro Devices agreed to settle their long-running dispute over competitive and licensing issues.AMD shares surged 21.8 per cent to $6.48 and Intel was down 0.8 per cent at $19.68.Applied Materials, the largest company in the chipmaker industry, reported its first quarterly profit in a year due to an increase in orders. However, the group also said it plans to shed 1,500 jobs in a further effort to cut costs.The restructuring plan is expected to achieve total annualised cost savings of about $450m. The shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $12.82.Churchill Downs, owner of the horse racing track that hosts the Kentucky Derby, announced it would buy the online betting company Youbet.com in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $127m. Churchill shares lost 2.6 per cent to $30.76 while Youbet gained 11.6 per cent to $2.69.Shares in United Technologies lost 0.4 per cent to $66.70 after it said it would acquire General Electric’s security business for $1.82bn. General Electric shares edged 0.5 per cent lower to $15.75.
41;AMAT;Applied Materials;2009-08-18T17:48:36Z;Potential of the sun dawns on the US;;"Solar panels may not adorn every rooftop but governments globally could finally be giving the industry the fresh impetus needed for it to fulfil its potential.In spite of record growth, rates over the past five years, high costs (solar energy can be four times as expensive as traditional gas-fired electricity) and the economic downturn mean solar has not become a mainstream energy source.While many solar companies were profitable before the economic downturn, boosted by government subsidies, the credit squeeze and fall in energy demand has hit them along with the rest of the power sector. This has led some component prices to drop, which has heaped pressure on margins at many manufacturers.Germany, Japan and Spain lead the market, mainly because their governments took an early lead in pushing the technology’s development and, as a result, the industry is led mostly by European companies.Germany’s Q-Cells is the world’s largest solar cell manufacturer, while Abengoa Solar, a Spanish company, this year built the world’s largest solar tower, delivering electricity to 10,000 homes.However, China and the US are making a concerted effort to make up for lost time. China is already the world’s biggest producer of solar panels but exports 90 per cent of the equipment, while many in the industry expect the US to overtake its rivals shortly following increased attention from Washington.Globally, Jeff Smidt, general manager of Underwriters Laboratories global energy business, says solar submissions for the seal of approval from the safety certification and testing organisation is on the rise, particularly from Chinese makers.“We're seeing a huge increase in solar panels submitted for our evaluation,'' Mr Smidt says.China is building its first commercial solar power station, which sparked interest from companies globally looking to bid for contracts.However, the US, following its $787bn economic stimulus package, which includes grants and tax breaks for US clean energy projects over the next 10 years, has attracted the most attention.“Most manufacturers around the world see the US as the next big thing for solar,” says Mr Smidt.A recent report by Pike Research, the clean technology research group, says the US could well lead the solar industry by 2014. It is currently the fourth largest, behind Germany, Spain and Japan.In anticipation of a boom there, a string of companies have in the past year moved into the US.SolarWorld, a German group, invested $500m in a solar-powered manufacturing plant in Oregon. SolarWorld combines all stages of the solar photovoltaic (PV) value chain, from the raw material silicon to solar power plants.Fotowatio, one of Spain’s largest independent solar power producers, agreed to buy the key US solar power assets, including the biggest US solar photovoltaic installation, at Nellis Air Force Base, from MMA Renewable Ventures of California.And Japan’s Itochu acquired 85 per cent of the shares of SolarNet, a solar photovoltaic system integrator.The concept of solar panels was developed in 1861 by Auguste Mouchout, who invented the first solar motor. In 1953, Bell Laboratories (now AT&T) created the first silicon solar cell able to generate an electric current to many high hopes. The 1970s oil embar- go sparked intense interest in the energy source.Solar is now used in a variety of ways. Photovoltaics converts sunlight into electricity; solar thermal absorbs the sun’s energy to provide low-temperature heat to create hot water or space heating; and concentrating solar power uses reflective materials in utility-sized systems to concentrate the sun’s heat to warm a synthetic liquid, which heats water to power steam turbines and produce electricity.In addition, passive solar is used by architects to direct sunlight to brighten buildings and sometimes involves building with special materials that absorb the sun’s heat to be released later to warm during cooler evenings.Legislation is a sure way to increase the use of solar power, says Branko Terzic, energy and resources regulatory policy leader for Deloitte, the consultancy. He points to Germany, which, among other countries, has increased its solar market by requiring utilities to buy all solar power made available at a government-set, high fixed price.The price is set high enough and length of sale terms are long enough to enable operators to finance projects and achieve attractive profit levels.However, Mr Smidt is concerned that consumers might not feel as strongly about the issue once the increase in high-cost renewables (solar and wind each account for about 1 per cent of the US energy produced) shows up on their electricity bills.“The real test is whether we have the political will to have relatively high energy prices when renewables become a significant part of the mix,” says Neal Schmale, president and chief operating officer of Sempra Energy, the power producer.Sempra recently opened its first solar power-generation project in Nevada, installing more than 167,000 solar modules on 32 hectares of desert to generate enough electricity to power about 6,400 homes. The entire 10MW output has been contracted under a 20-year power purchase agreement with Pacific Gas and Electric, the Northern California utility.Demand for renewables by utilities is growing as they must comply with state (and eventually, many expect, federal) renewable electricity standards, requiring a percentage of power production be from renewable sources.Mark Pinto, chief technology officer at Applied Materials, manufacturer of solar and semiconductor technology, says part of growing solar is changing the mindset, getting utilities who doubted the widespread use of such technology to see it will be built and used.“We’re selling solar like crazy in Houston,'' says John Berger, chief executive of Standard Renewable Energy. Given the long history of oil and gas in the energy capital of the world, that is saying something.This is part two of a series on Green Technologies"

BNY Mellon’s shares picked up 2.3 per cent to $28.71.Insurer Allstate was one of the steepest climbers in the financial sector, rising 6.3 per cent to $28.42 after Bank of America-Merrill Lynch recommended buying the shares, saying the company’s fundamentals remained strong and that the shares were undervalued following recent falls.Equities saw a turbulent afternoon as investors responded to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).The announcement that there would be no increase in quantitative easing and that the Fed saw economic activity “levelling out” saw stocks slip, before jumping, and then selling off shortly before the close.“The language was pretty optimistic, although with a note of caution,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets.But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, said: “I think ‘levelling out’ confused the market a little bit, and it points to a divided Fed.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.2 per cent higher at 1,005.81 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to 9,361.61 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,998.72.“We may be in for some bouncing around as investors decide whether to trust in the recovery and take the plunge into equities,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.Homebuilders were especially strong after Toll Brothers, which builds luxury houses, said cancellations fell and orders rose during the previous quarter, although it added that its units were selling for cheaper prices.Toll Brothers’ shares jumped 14.4 per cent to $23.42 and gave a boost to others in the sector.DR Horton gained 2.6 per cent to $13.45, while Lennar rose 4 per cent to $13.52.There was some optimism on consumer activity after department store Macy’s kicked off the retailers’ earnings season by beating earnings estimates and raising its full-year forecast.The shares were volatile, however, with some concern over the company’s warning of a “very difficult” trading environment as well as the fact its forecast remains at the lower end of analyst expectations.After a brief fall during the pre-market session, the shares rose 6 per cent to $16.40 during the day.Shares inSara Lee also bounced around after the company made a narrower loss than expected after one-off charges. There was strength in North American sales, which helped boost the shares before the bell, but they subsequently fell and finished 10 per cent down at $9.72.Meanwhile, Applied Materials, which produces equipment to make microchips, reported a narrower loss than predicted on relatively strong sales. Its shares rose 3.3 per cent to $13.66.The IPO market has shown signs of life in the past few days, culminating on Wednesday with what is likely to become the biggest US offering this year from Starwood Property Trust. The trust, which will invest in real estate, offered its shares at $20 and held on to that to close the day unchanged.But Emdeon,a healthcare services company, jumped on its first day of trade and the shares, which were priced at $15.50, climbed
6.6 per cent to $16.52.Imax, the cinema chain that shows films in 3D, entered the market on Tuesday priced on the Nasdaq at $8.50.Strong buying during the day saw the shares rise to $9.11 and they continued to build on that on Wednesday, strengthening 1.5 per cent to $9.25."
43;AMAT;Applied Materials;2009-06-22T12:22:31Z;Solar lessons from Silicon Valley;;This year’s summer solstice, when the sun reaches its farthest northerly arc, will see 970 trillion kilowatt hours of energy beamed to earth.The northern hemisphere’s longest day is a timely reminder of the urgency behind renewable power generation – a topic likely to gain momentum ahead of a United Nations climate change conference this year.Much has been written in recent months about slowing investment in renewable energy, amid falling prices for conventional energy and volatile demand for solar equipment.But the short-term impact of the economic slowdown should not be exaggerated on an industry that has enjoyed extraordinary growth in the past five years, and whose “energy dividend” could be measured in generations to come.The current economic challenge of the solar industry is a familiar theme for anyone in the technology sector: how to navigate short-term volatility – influenced in this case by rollercoaster energy prices – to deliver the long term benefits on next-generation power.There are lessons for solar among the semi-conductor suppliers of Silicon Valley, some of whom are emerging as leading equipment suppliers for the renewable energy market.Solar panels and semiconductor chips both use silicon to conduct electricity, are produced by similar types of nanotechnology tools, and are designed to facilitate the efficient travel of electrons. As a result, both solar panels and semiconductor chips are governed by the same rules of economics. The more of them you make, the cheaper they become, and the wider the range of cost-effective new applications.To anybody who has worked in the chip industry, it is clear that solar will follow a similar innovation curve. Just as Silicon Valley’s ingenuity made it possible to combine a telephone, a camera, a stereo, and a mini-computer into one small device, similar innovation skills are driving down the cost of solar power to a level competitive with fossil fuels.Hence, the cost of solar equipment and thus access to renewable energy will fall, enhancing its economic attraction against hydrocarbons.Quite possibly, the industry is nearing an inflection point. We are at the dawn of the era when we move from burning raw materials to meet most of our energy needs, to assembling raw materials to meet our needs. For the first time, high-tech engineering prowess has become relevant to the price of energy. We can manufacture our way out of the energy crisis.The key question is what the pace of clean energy innovation will be. The answer depends on long-term policy decisions being made in Washington DC, in Brussels, Beijing, and other cities, each likely to be reflected in the Copenhagen agenda later this year.Policy-makers have the power to hasten the pace of technological change by passing a national law that would require utilities to increase the portion of power they produce from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and other sources.Among the international proposals, one US renewable idea calls for progressively increasing the renewable power requirement to 25 per cent in 2025. This national “Renewable Electricity Standard” (RES) would halve the cost of solar generated power.The proposal will only work, however, if it is given some “teeth”, in the form of incentives or penalties that will encourage incremental improvement. More important, it would help the US solar industry become the type of success story the domestic semiconductor industry has been, with the potential to create creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in every state.One of the main benefits of this policy is something that Silicon Valley engineers understand intuitively. The RES would give innovation a faster drumbeat. In the computer industry, this rhythm is supplied by “Moore’s Law”, which suggests the power of computer chips would double about every 18 months. This exponential growth in computing power has made it possible for what would have been $3bn worth of technology in 1974 to fit inside a $250 iPod today.Moore’s Law happened because people made it happen. While Moore originally offered his “law” as a forecast, it eventually became an urgent standard that engineers pushed tirelessly to achieve. It has not been easy. Silicon Valley runs at a round-the-clock sprint.Over time, Moore’s Law became a fundamental part of the information economy. Based upon the expectation of a doubling in the power of chips every 18 months, computer manufacturers designed more powerful machines, software companies offered more sophisticated services, and venture capitalists invested in more ambitious businesses.The computer industry developed a completely new type of management culture – one based upon continuous innovation, rapid adaptation of new technologies, and aggressive exploitation of the benefits of scale.One of the most powerful arguments for the RES is that it would create a similar sense of urgency for green technology. By requiring companies to meet a constantly escalating external standard for the use of renewable power, it would ramp up the pace of innovation.While the prosperity created by the “smaller, faster, cheaper” computer chip will continue, clean technology is the growth industry of the future.
44;AMAT;Applied Materials;2009-06-09T20:51:29Z;US investors turn to materials and energy stocks;;"US equities edged upwards but stayed within the narrow range of the past six sessions as rising commodities and a slipping dollar failed to spark significant buying.Metal producers fared well as prices for their products rose. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gained 4.4 per cent to $58.96 while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, advanced 3.5 per cent to $11.15.Steel makers were also helped by rising metals prices, as well as analysis by Morgan Stanley, which upgraded shares in US Steel and AK Steel but downgraded those of larger rival Nucor.Shares in US Steel rose 7.9 per cent to $37.82 and AK Steel jumped 9.8 per cent to $19.10. Nucor’s gains were limited to 2.1 per cent at $47.76.But the strength in materials stocks was countered by weakness from the consumer sector, where Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer company, warned that the short-term environment remained challenging. P&G’s shares dropped 1.4 per cent to $52.41.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent up at 942.43, close to its highest finish of the year, and the Nasdaq Composite index finished 1 per cent higher at 1,860.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a fraction lower at 8,763.06.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford, said investors were looking at the dollar and commodities prices for signs of inflation to interpret the future direction of interest rates.“The market can only focus on one thing at once, and all week that has been whether interest rates will rise,” she said.Texas Instruments provided a boost for the technology sector after the microchip manufacturer said demand for its products would drive second-quarter sales and profits higher than previously forecast. The shares gained 6.3 per cent to $21.02.Bank of America added to the optimism in the sector when it said Microchip Technology‘s orders from China had improved, causing the bank to raise its price target on the company to $23. Microchip Technology’s shares picked up
6 per cent to $23.07.Other microchip manufacturers also benefited. Texas’s larger rival Intel advanced 3.1 per cent to $16.42 while Applied Materials gained 1.6 per cent to $11.03.News that the government will allow 10 of the country’s largest banks to repay a total of $68bn from the troubled asset relief programme failed to give the sector a lift, even though banks that repay the money will free themselves of some government involvement in matters such as hiring and executive pay.Several banks confirmed that they were on the list and some said they planned to repay the money soon. Morgan Stanley said it would repay its $10bn infusion in full but its shares fell 1.3 per cent to $30.98.Capital One, the credit card company, said it expected to repay its Tarp money “within weeks” and its shares rose 2.6 per cent to $24.05. American Express said it had also received approval, and its stock gained 5 per cent to $26.93.US Bancorp lost 0.9 per cent to $18.18 after it said it would also repay Tarp money but that the process of doing so would cost the bank $153m in second-quarter earnings.Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, said: “Financial stocks have been held back by the threat of inflation. We are seeing the negative effects of too much good economic news.”Some of the positive effect on financial stocks from the Tarp news was also damped by the congressional panel overseeing the Tarp process, which said the stress tests should be repeated on tougher terms.BlackRock continued its gains of the previous session as the company closed in on the purchase of Barclays Global Investors for a sum of $12bn-$13bn to create the world’s biggest money manager.The purchase would mean BlackRock has beaten off late competition for the unit from Bank of New York Mellon, and the company’s shares lifted 7.6 per cent to $182.14.BoNYM’s shares climbed 0.9 per cent to $28.79, as it confirmed it was also on the list of those allowed to repay Tarp funds."
45;AMAT;Applied Materials;2009-05-14T03:55:31Z;Poor retail data fuel Wall St mood;;US equities tumbled on Wednesday morning as figures showing retail sales unexpectedly fell in April dented hopes that the economy had stopped its decline.Sales fell 0.4 per cent for the month, against expectations that they would remain flat. The non-essential consumer sector, which has fallen over the week as investors position themselves more defensively, continued to drop, losing ??? per cent in early trade.This spoiled what might otherwise have been a good morning for consumer stocks after two major companies reported better than expected earnings.Macy’s, the department store chain, made a first quarter loss, but it was narrower than estimates had suggested. Its shares were up in early pre-market trade, but fell back after the release of the retail sales data. After half an hour of trading, its shares were 5.7 per cent lower at $11.65.Fellow retail giants Target and Loweâ€™s also fell, losing 3.6 per cent to $41.01 and 2.8 per cent to $18.70 respectively.Dr Pepper Snapple managed to hold on to early gains however after it made much more than the market had expected, despite net sales falling. It also raised its outlook for 2009 earnings, helping to send its shares up 5.3 per cent to $22.38.The economic gloom weighed on the market as a whole. The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8 per cent to 892.05 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7 per cent to 8322.56 points. The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 1.8 per cent to 1684.63 points.“April’s US retail sales figures are yet another illustration that, although the worst is now over, there is still no evidence of an actual recovery. The 0.4 per cent month-on-month fall in sales confirms our view that the rises in January and February were due to the one-off boost to incomes that has now run its course,” wrote Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics.The banking sector was another early faller after BB&T became the latest company to complete a stock sale following the results of the government’s stress tests on bank balance sheets.The bank sold 75m shares at $20 each, a discount to Tuesday’s closing price of $22.50. It was not one of those named as needing more capital by the government, but followed several of its rivals in going to the market to take advantage of the relatively bullish mood on Wall Street. Its shares lost 8.4 per cent to $20.61.Other banks also slipped in early trade as investors continued to take profits following their recent run up. Fifth Third lost 8.4 per cent to $7.54 while Bank of America gave up 4.8 per cent to $11.67.The financial sector also felt the impact of figures showing that mortgage applications fell more than 8 per cent during the week ending May 8. There were some encouraging signs however in the rising number of new mortgage applications as compared with refinancing activity, as well as in words from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secrtary, who said he saw “welcome signs” in the housing market.Chip manufacturers rose overnight after Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said that orders and billing patterns were “slightly better than expected” so far during the second quarter. The company’s shares picked up 0.2 per cent to $15.24.This helped the company’s shares overcome the effect of a record $1.5bn fine imposed by the EU on the company for abusing its dominant market position. Advanced Micro Devices, the company Intel was accused of squeezing out of the market, gained 2.5 per cent to $4.46.But other rivals lost the ground initially gained on the back of Mr Otellini’s words after the retail data showed sales of electronic goods and appliances fared worse than most sectors, falling 2.8 per cent lat month.Applied Materials had seen gains despite reporting a heavier first quarter loss than expected as sales dropped to their lowest levels in seven years, with one unnamed buyer had slashed its order from $1.9bn to $250m. But after the data, the shares fell in pre-market trade, and continued to do so after the opening bell, dropping 4.1 per cent to $11.01.Healthcare stocks were rare winners during the morning, continuing recent gains as investors positioned themselves more defensively, reflecting the likelihood that the recession will continue for some time. Pfizer rose 3.4 per cent to $15.44 while Merck and Schering-Plough, prospective merger partners, gained 4.4 per cent to $26.08 and 2.5 per cent to $23.63 respectively.Frontier Communications, which specialises in delivering telephone services to rural communities, fell after agreeing to buy a chunk of Verizon’s wireline business for $8.6bn, which would triple its business. Its shares fell 0.3 per cent to $7.55, while Verizon climbed 0.5 per cent to $30.54.MGM, the casino operator, became the latest company to go to the equity markets for funding as it seeks to restructure $14bn worth of debt. The company said it would sell $2.5bn in stocks and bonds, and its shares slumped 17.9 per cent to $10.18.But Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global said the recent equity raising activity was actually a good sign for the market. “Corporate issuance is heavy which is favourable for balance sheet health and the investment grade and high yield markets are holding firm,” he wrote.European stocks were lower early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 100 index was down 2 per cent to 835.55 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, led by the Shanghai Composite index, which rose 1.7 per cent to a nine-month high of 2,663.766 points.Bond yields were down, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note falling 1 basis point to 0.875 per cent and that on the 10-year note dropping 5bp to 3.125 per cent.The dollar was firmer against major currencies early in New York, gaining 0.8 per cent against the pound to $1.51.Gold was trading $0.44 higher at $927.34 per troy ounce.Oil prices were up early in New York. US crude prices were $0.34 lower at $58.51 a barrel.

They closed 6.7 per cent lower at $11.52.Fellow retail giants Target and Lowe’s also dropped, losing 4.8 per cent to $40.47 and 1.6 per cent to $18.92 respectively.Office Depot was a particularly heavy faller, affected also by a downgrade of its debt by Moody’s. The shares slumped 15 per cent to $3.06.Dr Pepper Snapple held on to early gains after it made much more than the market had expected, in spite of net sales falling.The company also raised its outlook for 2009 earnings, helping to send its shares up 3.8 per cent to $22.07.The economic gloom weighed on the market as a whole. The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 2.7 per cent to 883.92 points. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.2 per cent to 8,284.89 points. The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 3 per cent to 1,664.19 points.“January and February’s good consumer figures came after a boost from the one-off rises in income from Social Security rebates,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics.“The downward pressure on consumers is enough to make retail sales continue to fall in the next few months, although not as sharply as at the end of last year.”The banking sector was another faller after BB&T became the latest bank to complete a stock sale following the results of the US government’s stress tests.The bank sold 75m shares at $20 each, a discount to Tuesday’s closing price of $22.50. Its shares lost 4.4 per cent to $21.50.Other banks also fell as investors continued to take profits following their recent run higher. Fifth Third lost 14.7 per cent to $7.02 while Bank of America gave up 10.2 per cent to $11.01.“I can’t see any reason to hold financial stocks right now,” said Harry Rady, chief executive of Rady Asset Management. “There’s no way to know what is on the banks’ balance sheets yet.”The financial sector also felt the impact of figures showing that mortgage applications fell more than 8 per cent during the week ending May 8.There were some encouraging signs, however, in the rising number of new mortgage applications as compared with refinancing activity, as well as in comments from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, who said he saw “welcome signs” in the housing market.Chip manufacturers rose overnight after Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said that orders and billing patterns were “slightly better than expected” so far during the second quarter.This helped the company overcome the effect of being given a record $1.5bn fine by the European Union for abusing its dominant market position, and its shares avoided the worst of the selling, falling a relatively modest 0.5 per cent to $15.13.Advanced Micro Devices, the company Intel was accused of squeezing out of the market, gained 0.7 per cent to $4.38.Rival chip manufacturer Applied Materials had seen overnight gains on Mr Otellini’s comments despite reporting a heavier first-quarter loss than expected as sales dropped to their lowest levels in seven years. But the shares fell 4.3 per cent to $10.99 after the retail data, which showed that sales of electronic goods and appliances fared worse than most sectors, falling 2.8 per cent last month.Healthcare stocks were rare winners, maintaining recent momentum as investors positioned themselves defensively on signs the recession would continue for some time.Pfizer gained 2.3 per cent to $15.27, while Merckand Schering-Plough, which are due to merge, rose 2.8 per cent to $25.67 and 1.5 per cent to $23.40 respectively.
47;AMAT;Applied Materials;2009-04-07T20:55:53Z;Wall Street falls on earnings fears;;US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors waited cautiously for Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer, to kick off the earnings season after the close of the market.Alcoa dropped 1.5 per cent to $7.79 as analysts predicted that the company would make a first-quarter loss of $0.56 per share, with falling global demand taking its toll on profits. Its shares slipped further after the market closed when it reported a net loss of $0.61 a share, or $497m, on revenue of $4.1bn.Worries over earnings also weighed on Caterpillar, the machinery maker, which dropped 5.9 per cent to $29.45 after Andrew Obin, a Bank of America analyst, said the company was likely to make a wider first quarter loss than expected.“Investors are taking a little bit of profit off the table ahead of earnings,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. “The financials have managed to rally over 60 per cent in the last few weeks. But I do not think anyone knows what their earnings are going to be like, so some of that money is coming back out.”This followed a subdued session on Monday, during which volumes were low and the market adjusted to the views of Mike Mayo, one of the first analysts to turn bearish on the banking sector, that banks might suffer the worst loan losses since the Great Depression.Those fears were exacerbated on Tuesday after it was reported that the International Monetary Fund is set to forecast global losses on toxic assets of up to $4,000bn.Citi added to the gloom when its analysts cut the US equities market as a whole to “underweight”, saying valuations did not look “particularly attractive”.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 2.4 per cent down at 815.55 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3 per cent to 7,789.56 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.8 per cent to 1,561.61.“The market overextended on the way up and we’re seeing it correct itself a bit now,” said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. “Equities have a tendency to overshoot in both directions.”But Lincoln National provided a bright spot amid a falling financial sector after the life insurer said it was considering selling assets to build capital as it pays down $700m in debt. Its shares gained 8.2 per cent to $6.89.Health insurers also performed well after Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a government agency, said that it would increase its basline payments to those companies by 0.8 per cent, higher than originally proposed.Humana gained 6.1 per cent to $27.92, while UniteHealth picked up 6.9 per cent to $23.45 and Coventry Health lifted 3.5 per cent to $14.26.General Motors fell, giving up all of the gains made during the previous session, after Bloomberg reported that the company was speeding up preparations for bankruptcy. Its shares lost 11.9 per cent to $2.Ford fell 7.4 per cent, meanwhile, to $3.49 as investors took profits after its shares jumped 16 per cent during the previous session on the news that it had swapped $9.9bn worth of debt for cash and shares.Sun Microsystems, the previous session’s heaviest faller, continued to lose ground as analysts predicted the technology company would find it difficult to find another suitor after IBM withdrew its offer for the company over the weekend. Sun’s shares fell 4.3 per cent to $6.28.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Applied Materials shed 8.7 per cent to $10.55 after the computer chipmaker said a $1.9bn solar power contract had been cut to $250m.In oil, Exxon Mobil retreated 1.9 per cent to $68.71 after Barclays cut its 2009 and 2010 earnings estimates for the energy company, having lowered its estimates for natural gas prices.Archer-Daniels-Midland, the agricultural conglomerate, lost 10.6 per cent to $25.66 after Citi recommended selling the shares, saying the decline in its agricultural services business had been extremely fast.Utilities was the only sector briefly to find gains during the day, pulled upwards in part by PG&E, the Californian energy provider, which was upgraded by Credit Suisse. Analysts at the Swiss bank said the Californian regulatory environment would help the company maximise its earnings. PG&E shares rose 2.8 per cent to $37.83.
48;AMAT;Applied Materials;2009-02-11T22:01:38Z;Wall Street edges higher on stimulus hopes;;Financial stocks attracted a modicum of bargain hunters on Wall Street on Wednesday, but the wider market struggled to mount a convincing recovery from the previous session’s heavy sell-off.JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were among the winners as buyers returned tentatively to the sector. The two largest US banks by market capitalisation climbed 6 per cent to $26.09 and 7 per cent to $17.50, respectively, while regional banks advanced 7.3 per cent.Traders said there was little fundamental to drive buying in the sector following the sharp decline in the week, which came after the bank rescue plan from Timothy Geithner, Treasury secretary, failed to inspire confidence.“I haven’t heard anything today that says, after further review, he had some substance there,” said Christopher Colarik, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment. “I’m not finding any particular catalyst out there.”Still, optimism over the economic stimulus package helped the S&P 500 index close 0.8 per cent higher at 833.74. The benchmark index drifted between positive and negative territory in a choppy yet relatively subdued session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.6 per cent at 7,939.53 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 0.4 per cent at 1,530.50.The advance in financials came as the heads of eight financial institutions testified about the Treasury rescue plan before a House committee. The KBW Bank Index rallied 6 per cent.Better fourth-quarter results than expected from Marsh & McLennan pushed shares in the insurer 14.4 per cent higher to $21.41 and helped prop up the sector.XL Capital surged 61.4 per cent to $4.68 after the group disclosed plans to let go of 10 per cent of its staff and a cut in its dividend. Standard & Poor’s affirmed key credit ratings.Offsetting the bounce for financials, however, the energy sector was hurt by a sharply lower oil price after release of inventory figures and lost 1.3 per cent overall.The technology sector also underperformed, hit by a downbeat assessment of prospects from Research In Motion. The US-listed shares sank 14.5 per cent to $48.76 after the BlackBerry phone maker warned that fourth-quarter profit would come in at the low end of its targets, signalling the company had sacrificed margins to gain customers.Elsewhere in the sector, Nvidia lost 12.6 per cent to $8.15 after the graphics chip maker disclosed a worse fourth-quarter loss than expected.Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global, said of the downbeat technology news: “These data points are a reason to sell on the surface, although RIM’s volumes are strong and a plus for component demand.”Applied Materials, the computer chip tools maker, warned late on Tuesday that chipmakers would spend 50 per cent less this year for its products. The company also posted a fiscal first-quarter loss of nearly $133m and said it would cut 14 per cent of its workforce, about 2,000 jobs. The shares edged 0.8 per cent higher at $9.77.Also weighing on the market, a report from the commerce department showed that the US trade deficit shrank 4 per cent in December as the global financial crisis cut imports and exports for the fifth consecutive month.On the plus side, shares in Mead Johnson Nutrition, the Bristol-Myers Squibb unit that is the world’s largest maker of infant formula, began trading after it raised $720m, more than expected, in the first US flotation since November. The shares rose 10.1 per cent to $26.43 in their debut session.In the consumer sector, shares in Best Buyadded 1.7 per cent to $29.19 after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its “conviction buy” list.

49;AMAT;Applied Materials;2009-02-11T00:04:45Z;Heading for Silicon Gulch;;If the daily bad news about semiconductors continues much longer, Silicon Valley may shrink to a gulch.The headlines were unrelentingly dismal on Tuesday as the industry reeled from collapsing demand.Consider these lowlights:The only apparently positive news of the day came from Intel, which said it would use its financial clout as the world’s biggest chipmaker to invest $7bn in four US manufacturing plants to upgrade them to the next level of miniaturisation – circuit widths of 32 billionths of a metre.Of course, this is profoundly negative for Intel’s rivals, who can afford to do no such thing right now and face being undercut by Intel’s cheaper processes.

51;AMAT;Applied Materials;2009-02-02T22:20:23Z;Applied Materials warns of loss;;Applied Materials, the supplier of semiconductor equipment, said on Monday it had been driven into a loss as the fortunes of its chipmaker customers nosedived.Applied warned of a loss of 9 to 11 cents per share for its first quarter ending January 25, after expecting in November earnings of zero to 4 cents a share.It blamed a restructuring charge of $138m connected to cost reductions announced in November and a provision of $48m for likely bad debts due to its customers’ deteriorating financial conditions. There were also additional inventory charges of $20m related to a decline in demand for its semiconductor and display equipment.Applied, which is due to report its full results on February 10, said net sales were expected to be $1.33bn, down 35 per cent on the previous quarter and at the low end of its earlier guidance of down 25 to 35 per cent.“The company intends to continue implementing cost reduction programmes, including shutdowns and additional restructuring activities, as appropriate for the unprecedented business conditions,” it said in a statement.Applied Material shares were down 0.6 per cent at $9.31 in midday trading in New York. They are down nearly 50 per cent over the past six months.Analysts at S&P’s Equity Research reiterated a “buy” recommendation on the shares even as they reduced their earnings forecast for Applied’s fiscal year from a 28 cents a share profit to a 28 cents a share loss .“We believe the sales decline is near those recently announced by peers. We think semiconductor and flat-panel capital spending will be down as much as 50 per cent in calendar year 2009.” they said.Applied has tried to diversify in recent years into supplying equipment for makers of flat-panel displays and solar panels.But it is feeling the impact at the bottom of the supply chain as chipmakers and display makers see demand for their products wither in the global economic downturn. They are conserving cash by reducing capital spending on new plants and equipment.Applied has built up a big order book for its solar panel equipment, but that industry is also beginning to suffer in the credit crunch.The Silicon Valley company announced a workforce cut of 12 per cent or 1,800 people in November.The Semiconductor Industry Association ón Monday reported the first year-on-year drop in sales since 2001, with global chip revenues falling 2.8 per cent to $248.6bn in 2008.
52;AMAT;Applied Materials;2008-11-14T19:12:44Z;Nokia;;"Nokia’s warning that global handset sales are likely to fall for the second time ever next year should come as no surprise to anyone who has been following developments further up the mobile phone supply chain.Last week, Qualcomm, the world’s biggest maker of microchips used in mobile phones, warned that the handset makers were tightening their belts as it cut its sales forecast for the full year. Applied Materials, a maker of semiconductor equipment, has announced job cuts and a fall in orders. Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker and a technology industry bellwether, also weighed in with grim news, warning of a slowdown across all geographies and market segments.Nokia’s shares, nevertheless, managed to shed more than 11 per cent of their value in the hour or so after its announcement. They later bounced back to end the day down 4 per cent, capping a slide of 61 per cent since January. Nokia has issued profit warnings in two successive quarters. News that business customers’ purchasing power had been hit by limited access to credit was hardly reassuring. Yet in spite of its problems, which include aggressive price cuts by rivals, Nokia’s scale and broad portfolio of phones make it perhaps among the best-positioned of the big handset makers to weather the storm.Nokia declined to provide a number, but analyst forecasts for the decline in global handset shipments range between 4 and 27 per cent next year. The more optimistic end of that spectrum would match the 4 per cent sales drop during the industry’s first downturn in 2001. High rates of ownership and a trend of customers holding on to their old handsets longer mean the industry faced a tougher sales environment even before the recession took hold. The sales forecast was an unwelcome development. But it would be hard for investors to argue they were not sufficiently warned.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

53;AMAT;Applied Materials;2008-11-13T00:06:22Z;Intel shocks Wall Street with revenue warning;Rapid decline in demand hits chipmaker;Intel on Wednesday shocked Wall Street with a revenue and margins warning that indicated a rapid decline in the business of the world’s largest chipmaker over the past month.Intel, a bellwether for the technology industry, reported that sales were being “affected by significantly weaker than expected demand in all geographies and market segments”.“In addition, the PC supply chain is aggressively reducing component inventories,” it said.The warning came less than a month after Intel issued forecasts for the fourth quarter on its third-quarter earnings call, and amounted to a 14 per cent cut in revenue expectations since the time of that call.Intel said it now expected revenues of $9bn, plus or minus $300m, down from $10.1bn–$10.9bn. Gross margins were now expected to be about 55 per cent compared with 59 per cent previously.In another sign of the rapid deterioration of the business climate, Intel said its warning replaced a planned mid-quarter update scheduled for December 4.It announced last month that it was bringing back a mid-quarter update after a three-year absence, because of the level of economic uncertainty.Intel’s shares fell 6 per cent in after-hours trading in New York on Wednesday to $12.71.Roger Kay, semiconductor analyst with Endpoint Technologies, said PC makers such as Dell were cutting back on orders from manufacturers in Asia and reducing their inventories of chips and other components to conserve cash.“I think frankly the worst is yet to come – despite the throttling back by the participants in the supply chain, it won’t be enough, and there will be inventory overhang in Q1 and the first quarter will be worse,” he said.“We went through this before in 2000 when we mis-predicted the depth of the recession and 2000 was much milder than this.”Qualcomm, the biggest supplier of wireless chips for mobile phones, last week cut its estimates significantly for the remainder of the year as it noted its customers were tightening their belts. It reported a very sharp decline in inventories over the previous fortnight as customers tried to preserve their working capital.Applied Materials, the biggest supplier of chip-making equipment, said yesterday it was cutting 1,800 jobs or 12 per cent of its workforce in order to cut costs in the face of a slump in orders.

Citigroup cut its full-year 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates for JPMorgan, among others, while Merrill Lynch downgraded the shares of Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.JPMorgan shares fell 2.7 per cent to $36.91, Lehman dropped 4 per cent to $15.57, while Goldman gave up 1.4 per cent to $164.90 and Morgan dropped 5.5 per cent to $40.15.On Wednesday, the financial sector slid 3 per cent with Bank of America and Citigroup coming under selling pressure. The pair lost 7.2 per cent to $28.86 and 3.9 per cent to $17.81 respectively.“We continue to believe that investors are significantly underestimating both the scope and the extent of the credit bubble and the consequences of its subsequent deflation,” said Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch.“The problems in the financial sector appear to us to be far from over, and we are sceptical that trying to bottom-fish will prove to be profitable.”Observers suggested that the sector might remain under pressure in the short term after the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed a rule limiting certain types of short-selling in a handful of stocks to expire on Tuesday.In earnings news, Deere, the maker of farm equipment, said third-quarter profits rose 7.1 per cent to $575.2m thanks to strong demand for tractors and combines.But the results missed analysts estimates and the shares fell 3.2 per cent to $67.10. The news dragged on peers. Caterpillar dipped 2.8 per cent to $69.83, Boeing fell 2.5 per cent to $64.26 and the industrial sector as a whole declined 0.8 per cent.There was better news from the technology sector.Applied Materials, the maker of semiconductor machinery, projected that orders would increase between 5-10 per cent in the fourth quarter. That was better than expected and the shares rose 4.7 per cent to $19.33.Meanwhile, Nvidia, the maker of computer graphics chips, jumped 10.7 per cent to $12.26 after the company said it would buy back an additional $1bn of shares, bringing the projected total repurchase to about 44 per cent of all outstanding shares.Equity markets pared early losses but by the close, seven of the 10 leading industry groups were still in the red, knocking the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent to 1,285.83. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.9 per cent to 11,532.96, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.1 per cent to 2,428.62.Consumer-facing stocks were in focus as oil prices ticked more than $3 a barrel higher, a number of retailers reported disappointing results and new data showed weak retail sales in July.Liz Claiborne, the women’s apparel retailer, was among the biggest fallers after it reported a substantial second-quarter loss and lowered its full year forecast. The shares slid 11.6 per cent to $13.18.Retailers and the broader consumer discretionary sector also took some direction from a Commerce Department report on July retail sales. The survey showed that sales fell 0.1 per cent last month. That is the first headline dip in five months and will be seen as evidence that the impact of the stimulus cheques is waning.McDonald’s fell 1.8 per cent to $62.78 and Wal-Mart Stores lost 1.9 per cent to $57.88 while the consumer discretionary and staples sectors gave up 1.6 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively.Energy and material stocks were among the few consistent gainers throughout the day. Energy added 3.4 per cent, snapping a four-day losing streak, and materials climbed 2.4 per cent as heavily sold coal and metals stocks rebounded.Peabody Energy and Massey Energy rose 8.3 per cent to $58.85 and 7.8 per cent to $61 respectively while US Steel and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 6.2 per cent to $137.92 and 5.8 per cent to $88.50 respectively.Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S&P Equity Research, upgraded the energy sector to “overweight” arguing that “from a technical perspective, S&P believes the correction in oil prices from the recent high of $147 to below $115 is largely over.”

Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.1 per cent.Department store operator Macy’s provided further encouragement after it said first-quarter sales fell less than analysts estimated and it reiterated annual forecasts. Its shares rose 3.6 per cent to $24.93.Before the CPI data, stock futures had pointed to a lower opening. But by the close in New York, the S&P 500 index was 0.4 per cent higher at 1408.66.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent at 2,496.70, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.5 per cent higher at 12,898.38. All three indices had been over 1 per cent up for the day earlier in the afternoon.Oil hit a trading record of $126.98 during the previous session. Light, sweet crude for June delivery fell 50 cents to $125.30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday.Whole Foods Market said its fiscal second-quarter profit fell 13 per cent as the grocery store’s purchase of Wild Oats Markets led to higher costs. Shares in Whole Foods plunged 13.9 per cent to $28.96.The Texas-based company also said that the sluggish US economy and intensifying competition could put downward pressure on its sales growth.Deere, the world’s largest maker of tractors and combine harvesters, reported a 22 per cent rise in net income for the fiscal second quarter, but said escalating raw material costs would have an impact on operations for the rest of the year. It projected fiscal third-quarter net income below analysts’ expectations. Deere shares fell 9.9 per cent at $81.25.Before the opening bell on Wednesday, Freddie Mac posted a net loss that proved not as big as expected, and said it planned to raise $5.5bn in fresh capital. Its shares advanced 9.2 per cent to $27.25.Fellow mortgage lender Fannie Mae also moved higher, gaining 6.3 per cent to $29.89.Yahoo was in focus. In the previous session its shares jumped to their highest level since Microsoft abandoned its takeover offer last week. Expectations rose that the internet company would come under renewed pressure to consider a deal.Carl Icahn, the activist investor, is considering proposing nominees to the company’s board as a way to force Yahoo’s hand, according to one investor who has worked as an ally with him on similar situations. Shares in Yahoo rose 2.2 per cent to $27.14.Sony swung to a fiscal fourth-quarter profit as losses connected to the electronics group’s PlayStation 3 gaming console declined. The company earned $277m, up from a net loss of $646m in the same period a year ago. Shares in the company rose 8.4 per cent to $49.93.Troubled insurer American International Group was due to hold its annual meeting after it posted heavy losses in the two most recent quarters.Former chief executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, still the largest individual shareholder at AIG, pushed the world’s largest insurer to postpone the meeting in a letter released on Monday. AIG shares were up 0.7 per cent at $39.44.Applied Materials, a manufacturer of equipment used by computer chipmakers, reported lower earnings and revenue after the market closed on Tuesday, as new orders in the period fell. Its shares gained 0.2 per cent to $19.90.Fiscal second-quarter income at fast-food chain Jack In The Box fell 22 per cent amid a drop in same-store sales at its restaurants as the company reduced its sales forecast for the year.The company posted net income of $26.4m down from $27.2m a year earlier.Results from the latest period included a gain of $11.9m on the sale of 23 restaurants to frachises.

57;AMAT;Applied Materials;2008-03-24T19:08:41Z;Silicon Valley feels the power of the sun;;"Applied Materials is winning itself a place in the sun with a high-stakes gamble on expansion into the solar industry.As the world’s biggest maker of equipment for the semiconductor ind­­ustry, Silicon Valley-based Applied Materials is used to providing tools that help others to be creative. But a $1.9bnfactory order, understood to be from a Chinese consortium, impressed analysts this month and showed Applied becoming more directly involved with solar.The order is more than five times bigger than any order the company has ever received for chip tools and demonstrates that the company’s contribution to the success of the technology could be far bigger than occurred in semiconductors. But to achieve this, Applied is undergoing a transformation of its business that includes acquisitions and offering to fit out production lines.Mark Pinto, Applied’s chief technology officer and head of its new energy and environmental business, speaks with the enthusiasm of an inventor freed to make his dreams come true. “What is exciting about solar for our employees is that we feel like it’s in our hands, we can play a very big role,” he says.In his previous career as a scientist in Bell Labs, the research division of phone company AT&T, Mr Pinto was frustrated by a company culture that could not get great ideas into the marketplace. Now he is seeing the impact of combining his research efforts with business development in a fast-growing industry eager to embrace new methods and technology.With semiconductors, he says, Applied has been dependent on oth­ers to come up with “killer applications”, such as Apple and its iPhone, in order to drive industry innovation and sustain demand for transistors and the equipment that makes them. “Solar provides way less than one-tenth of 1 per cent of the world’s energy needs, so the potential market is huge. The killer app is already there – if you lower the cost of solar, the market is there,” he says.Applied believes its technology is key to making solar energy cheap­er. Announcing its expansion into solar in September 2006, Mike Splinter, chief executive, promised to cut the cost per watt of generating solar power from $3-$5 to $1. “We plan to change the cost equation for solar power through adaptation of our existing technology and new innovation in order to help make solar a more meaningful contributor to the global energy supply,” he said.In other words, in changing its own business, it is also changing the economics of a new industry. Ap­plied was in a unique position to do this because of its knowledge of handling silicon – a base material for both semiconductors and solar panels – and because of a separate foray into making equipment for flat-panel display makers.Applied entered this business in 1991. In semiconductors, Applied’s core expertise is in making equipment that can create depositions – thin layers of insulating material on chip wafers. A similar deposition process is needed for flat-panel displays. Applied Materials and display manufacturers discovered they could be made more cost-effectively the bigger the size of glass from which the screens were cut. Applied’s machines for making the panels have grown so big they can no longer fit even on 747 jumbo jets and are mainly assembled on site. Now variations on this equipment have been adapted for solar panels.Mr Pinto says the company initally assumed only panels small enough to be carried up ladders and fitted on residential roofs would be needed. But the industry has told it that bigger panels are re­quired for utilities to assemble solar farms and for other commercial installations. He says a kind of Moore’s Law is at work, referring to Gordon Moore of Intel’s 1965 paper that predicted the number of transistors on a chip would double around every 18 months. This was really about costs coming down with miniaturisation. With display and solar panels, the economics are also about cost per area, with the costs falling if the panels can be cut from bigger sheets. Installation is also much cheaper with fewer, larger solar panels.Applied is focusing on thin-film solar, which exploits the photovoltaic effect of sunlight being absorbed by materials and converted directly into electricity. Silicon only 2-3 millionths of a metre thick is deposited on a glass substrate in the thin-film process. But Applied has also hedged its photovoltaic bet by buying companies that are expert in crystalline silicon, whose cells need more silicon, around 175 millionths of a metre thick. Its acquisitions in the past two years include Italy’s Baccini, which makes test systems for manufacturers of crystalline silicon, bought for $330m, and HCT Shaping Systems, a Swiss company that cost Applied $475m for technology that cuts silicon into pieces thinner than the slimmest salami slice.Paula Mints, solar analyst with Navigant Consulting, says Applied has done the right thing, since she expects thin-film will grab no more than 50 per cent of the market. “There is always a cost/efficiency trade-off,” she says, alluding to the fact that thin-film is cheaper in needing less silicon, but it is less efficient in converting the sun’s rays to electricity.In thin-film solar factories, Applied’s deposition equipment ac­counts for 70 per cent of the costs. It has therefore offered to equip com­plete factories for panel-makers, while integrating the other 30 per cent worth of equipment such as conveyor belts, sourced from other suppliers. The full solar production line it offers is another departure for Applied, says Mr Splinter: “We have changed the business model here too – when we started in thin-film solar there was basically no industry, so we started off a complete line. We’ve never done this before.”Tim Arcuri, Citigroup semiconductor equipment analyst, says the Chinese order shows Applied’s stra­tegy of offering large-scale complete solutions is working. “It has been something of a holy grail to build monster gigawatt factories using these big pieces of glass to achieve a very low cost per watt,” he says.The first Applied-fitted factories are coming on stream this month, equipment orders are expected to be worth more than $2.5bn by 2010, and Mr Arcuri says he can easily see solar accounting for a quarter of Applied’s revenues by then. But the company faces competition from rivals such as First Solar and Oerlikon Solar and the future path of solar technology has yet to be determined.“This is a huge gamble for us,” cautions Mr Splinter. “We are betting a lot of shareholders’ money as well as our own research and development that this is going to be big and very successful. So far, so good – it’s the greatest opportunity the company has had in many years, but I think we still have a long way to go.”The whys and hows of cutting what a watt costsApplied Materials’ venture into providing manufacturing equipment for the solar panel industry is part of a surge of interest in Silicon Valley in the alternative energy.Venture capitalists have funded start-ups trying new materials and methods to convert the sun’s rays into electricity, while Cypress Semiconductor span off solar-panel provider SunPower in 2005.Google has the largest solar panel installation of any US corporate campus and has launched an initiative to explore solar thermal power – concentrating the sun’s heat to produce electricity.With silicon currently the key material used in both semiconductors and solar panels, the Valley is in a good position to put its expertise to good use.Mike Splinter, Applied’s chief executive and a Valley veteran, says solar reminds him of the early days of semis.“People are jockeying for position; there are different technologies and materials and we are feeling our way,” he says.“As the cost comes down, the solar market should scale much faster as there’s a huge market electricity, whereas then there was no computer market.”According to Citigroup analyst Tim Arcuri: “There’s going to be a shake-out, with there being four or five different technologies and their different supply chains. But when there’s a scrum like this, I would not bet against the Valley.”Paula Mints, solar analyst at Navigant Consulting, offers a different perspective: “Silicon Valley is a marketing term.“I don’t think we have any more sand or processed sand than anywhere else. But we do have an area that draws interesting, capable, brilliant people to it.”"
58;AMAT;Applied Materials;2008-03-05T03:12:37Z;Applied Materials in $1.9bn solar coup;;Applied Materials’ gamble on becoming a major supplier to the solar panel industry appeared to have paid off on Tuesday when it won a $1.9bn order, the biggest ever for its production equipment.Analysts said the deal for the world’s largest supplier of equipment for the semiconductor industry was about five times bigger than any order it had ever received in its core business.Applied said in a regulatory filing that the deal was struck with “a privately held corporation outside the US”, but Citigroup analysts said they believed it was a Chinese government consortium planning to build a “solar city” in Suzhou, a city of more than 2m people 40 miles from Shanghai.Applied shares rose more than 7 per cent to close at $20.32 in New York.The Silicon Valley company expanded into the solar energy field in 2006 after it acquired Applied Films, a supplier of thin-film deposition equipment for solar cells, for a net $300m.Citigroup said it believed the order was to provide equipment for about 15 production lines to be installed from this June. Applied said the equipment was expected to produce an annual output of solar photovoltaic modules capable of generating electricity on a gigawatt scale.
59;AMAT;Applied Materials;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Wall Street rises on US retail figures;;Wall Street stocks advanced on Wednesday as US retail sales rose unexpectedly, providing some reassurance that consumers may continue to spend in spite of the gloomy outlook for the economy.Solid earnings from Applied Materials boosted sentiment in technology stocks, which were also buoyed by reports that Yahoo is exploring an alliance with News Corp.Oil services companies were a source of market strength as crude oil prices rose above $93 a barrel. However, recently popular defensive sectors, including healthcare and consumer staples, lagged behind as investors became less risk averse.The S&P 500 closed up 1.4 per cent at 1,367.20, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5 per cent to 12,552.24 and the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.3 per cent to 2,373.93 as oversold, large-cap, tech stocks attracted buyers.Equities rallied after retail sales increased 0.3 per cent in January versus a consensus forecast of a 0.3 per cent drop. Strong sales of new cars and petrol contributed to the unexpected uptick but, with these two factors stripped out, retail sales were flat. Furniture stores and building materials were among the sectors registering a decline in salesIn spite of these caveats, the retail data were mostly welcomed by Wall Street, which feared that US consumers would rein in spending as house prices slumped and the outlook for the employment market darkened. But some analysts were less sanguine: “Although headline retail sales were above expectations in January, the details are weaker,” John Ryding economist at Bear Stearns, said, noting downward revisions in previous months and the narrow sector breadth of January’s gains.After an initial surge, retail stocks fell back to relatively modest gains. Among the best performers was Jones Apparel, which climbed 11 per cent to $17.15 after its quarterly results beat Wall Street estimates.President Bush on Wednesday signed a $168bn economic stimulus bill which is set to provide 130m Americans with tax rebates. Although Wall Street expects retailers to benefit from the package, Citi Investment Research said the spending boost would be thinly spread, with any spending increase concentrated on low-margin items at discount and food retailers.In spite of the more positive mood on Wednesday, volatility remained high. Standard & Poors said that its benchmark index had risen or fallen more than 1 per cent on 17 out of 28 trading days in 2008, the third most volatile start to a year on record after 1932 and 1933.Such volatility was also in evidence on Tuesday when billionaire investor Warren Buffett said he was willing to assume the liability for up to $800bn in municipal bonds guaranteed by monoline bond insurers facing possible credit downgrades. Analysts said the plan would do little to solve bond insurers’ real problem – the heavy losses they took selling insurance on structured credit securities that have turned sour.

Several banks and ratings agencies downgraded its stock, with Merrill Lynch warning that the company could face bankruptcy if financing conditions worsened. By Thursday, Countrywide was forced to tap an $11.5bn credit line.The mortgage giant’s stock soared on Friday after Bank of America upgraded its rating, but by the close Countrywide was down 23.1 per cent for the week at $21.43.Other mortgage providers in investors’ sights were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the government-sponsored enterprises pressed for their portfolio caps to be lifted.

Merrill Lynch triggered selling by downgrading the mortgage lender, warning that it could face bankruptcy if financing conditions worsen.Fortress Investment Group dropped 8.6 per cent to $17.56, below its intial public offer price of $18.50. The drop followed a fall of 6.6 per cent on Tuesday.Financing problems in the vast commercial paper market this week have raised fears among investors that the funding for financial institutions and companies is faltering.The latest bout of bad news came from KKR Financial, whose shares had fallen 31.1 per cent to $10.52.

The stock closed 2 per cent lower at $31.10.Following lower-than-expected results from Wal-Mart and Home Depot on Tuesday, Macy’s results cast a shadow over retailers.“While the sour tone pervades investor sentiment, fears are building of spill-over from financial to consumer sectors,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior analyst at Interactive Brokers.Applied Materials fell 4.1 per cent to $20.36 after the bellwether semiconductor machine manufacturer reported that profit fell 7.5 per cent and revenue growth declined in the fiscal third quarter.

Stocks opened lower but losses were quickly contained. “Any link between Shanghai and the S&P 500 is tenuous at best,” said Jack Ablin, portfolio manager at Harris Private Bank.For some investors, the lack of a major pullback in US stocks was disappointing.“We were ready for some opportunities in equities if there was a large sell-off,” said Michael Kastner, port-folio manager at Sterling-Stamos.After the Fed minutes were released, the leading benchmarks made fresh highs and the S&P 500 index finished up 0.8 per cent at 1,530.23, above its March 2000 close of 1,527.46. The June S&P futures contract rebounded from a low of 1,512.60 earlier in the day and closed at a new contract high of 1,532.50.

Caterpillar, up 3.6 per cent at $78.48, led gainers in the Dow.Healthcare stocks Merck, down 1.3 per cent at $52.71, and Pfizer, off 0.5 per cent at $27.41, both weighed on the blue-chip benchmark.A bright spot in the healthcare sector was Biogen Idec, up 5.9 per cent at $52.13 after it approved a $3bn buy-back of its stocks.With attention focused on employment, inflation and manufacturing reports due on Friday, stocks generally traded in a narrow range.“All eyes are on the employment report,” said Mr Ablin. “The labour market has been sustaining the consumer in the face of higher gas prices and weak housing.”On Wednesday, ADP said it expects 97,000 new private sector jobs were created in May. The ADP report which excludes government workers suggests payrolls will be around 117,000 this month, below the current consensus call of 135,000.Traders believe a payroll gain of at least 100,000 jobs will be enough to soothe concerns that the labour market is faltering.Mr Kastner said investors were hoping that capital investment spending would take over from consumer spending in pulling up economic growth and take over from consumer spending in the months ahead. He also believed corporate earnings were likely to fall this year, pressuring stock valuations.Merger and acquisition activity on Wednesday was led by the news that CDW the technology retailer had agreed to a $7.3bn private equity buy-out.InterContinental Exchange struck a $665m deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange in the hope of boosting the chances of its hostile bid for CBOT Holdings.At this juncture, the CBOT has agreed to be bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Citigroup upgraded the beverage maker to a “buy” with a $59 price target.NiSource fell 7.8 per cent to $22.07 after the utility said it had concluded talks without selling its Indiana electricity assets, but would still consider spinning off that unit. Utility stocks have recently pared solid gains this year – the S&P utility sector is up 12.8 per cent in 2007 – as investors have become concerned at the sector’s low dividend yield as compared with rising bond yields.“Utilities have run a little further beyond reasonable valuations,” said Mr Ablin.Verisign was 5.3 per cent higher at $29.43 after chief executive Stratton Sclavos resigned. The internet infrastructure company’s stock is up 22.1 per cent this year on the back of expansion and diversification of its operations.
64;AMAT;Applied Materials;2007-05-16T20:36:48Z;Wall St rallies on billionaires’ bets;;Wall Street rallied strongly on Wednesday with trading influenced by a number of well-known investors revealing their latest purchases in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Early on Wednesday, stocks traded in a choppy fashion as a better-than-expected rise for industrial production in April was offset by news that building permits last month fell at their fastest pace since 1990.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was boosted by the disclosure that its constituents, Citigroup, and Johnson & Johnson were in favour among leading investors.The Dow closed up 0.8 p+er cent at 13,487.53, and set its 23rd record close for the year. The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to close at 1,514.14 and edged closer to its record level of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Georges Yared, chief investment officer at Yared Investment Research said good earnings and guidance for the coming quarter should support stocks and that the S&P was building up to moving higher towards its 2000 record peak.Within the S&P, telecom, and financial stocks led the major sectors higher, while materials lagged.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said that while all 10 major S&P sectors were still trading near their recent highs, “many seem to be rolling over a bit.”They said: “Financials, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and health care have all had slight declines after hitting overbought levels, and it will be key to see how they react to resistance levels.”The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent to 2,547.42, and shrugged off weakness among semiconductors stocks. Earnings and lower guidance from Applied Materials did weigh upon technology for much of on Wednesday and the Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 0.2 per cent, following a slide of 1.1 per cent on Tuesday.Applied Materials, a chipmaker, reported better-than-expected earnings, but its guidance for sales disappointed investors. Its shares were down 3.1 per cent at $19.17.Meanwhile the Russell 2000 index of small companies rose 0.7 per cent at 820.29 and rebounded from its lowest closing level in more than a month on Tuesday.A number of stocks were in the spotlight on Wednesday when Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment company, said it had invested in Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific, two railroads, and also bought stock in Wellpoint and raised its holding in Johnson & Johnson, two healthcare companies.Norfolk Southern rose 1.65 per cent to $56.79, Union Pacific gained 0.9 per cent to $119.39 and the S&P railroad index rallied 1.3 per cent, taking its gain for the year to 25.1 per cent.Wellpoint gained 1.6 per cent at $84.86, while Johnson & Johnson rallied 2 per cent to $63.05.Edward Lampert, the hedge fund manager, said late on Tuesday that he had purchased 15m shares of Citigroup. This prompted the shares to jump 4 per cent to $54.91. Analysts believe that the banking conglomerate could now become the next high-profile target for activist investors, given its underperforming share price in recent years. Such a move would show that even the biggest companies were not immune to activist pressure.Meanwhile, George Soros, another of the most famous hedge fund managers, said his stake in Microsoft had doubled, and the stock rose 0.55 per cent to $31.07. Mr Soros had lowered his holdings in Oracle, and shares were up 0.8 per cent at $18.99, while he had sold shares in Ebay, down 0.75 per cent at $33.25, and Take-Two Interactive, and shares in the video game maker slid 0.2 per cent at $19.08.Another big investor, Carl Icahn, a well-known activist, said he had purchased a large slice of Anadarko Petroleum, boosting its shares by 1.6 per cent to $47.20, and also bought shares in CSX, the railroad finished up 1.4 per cent at $46.40.

Shares in the the maker of eye-care products jumped 9.8 per cent to $67.50.“We believe pressure on operating cash flow, as the company struggles to recapture lost market share, creates significant risks in terms of return on capital for an acquiring firm and we do not expect any higher offers,” said Robert Gold, medical devices analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.After the closing bell, Hewlett-Packard said second-quarter profit fell 6.5 per cent after a tax gain in the year- earlier period. In after-hours trade, shares in the computer maker were 0.7 per cent lower at $44.86, after a rise of 1 per cent in regular trade.Shares in Amazon closed 4.4 per cent higher at $63.22, after the online retailer said it plans to launch a digital music store later this year and sell songs without copy protection restrictions.In earnings news, Compuware reported a 20 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings and its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $10.67.Shares in Federated Department stores rose 1.2 per cent to $62.69 after its first-quarter profit rose more than 5 per cent, but missed analysts’ estimates.
65;AMAT;Applied Materials;2007-04-10T21:41:21Z;Wall Street rally as earnings loom;;Wall Street stocks rose modestly on Tuesday, with investors in a cautious mood as the start of earnings season beckoned.Companies and analysts have sharply lowered first quarter earnings forecasts since the start of the year. Average profits for S&P 500 companies are now forecast to rise by 3.3 per cent compared with the first quarter last year – a result that would break a run of 14 quarters with growth above 10 per cent.“There is a low earnings hurdle for companies this quarter,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Next week the pace of earnings results will intensify, but Alcoa kicked off the quarterly reporting season with its first quarter results after the closing bell on Tuesday. The company beat analyst estimates and its profit rose 9 per cent, driven by higher metal prices and strong demand from aerospace and industrial customers.Alcoa’s stock jumped 1.7 per cent to $35.50 in after-hours trade. Alcoa rose 0.1 per cent to $34.90 in regular trade on Tuesday and buoyed by higher aluminium prices, Alcoa’s stock price has risen more than 16 per cent so far this year. That makes Alcoa the best performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Against the backdrop of a slowing economy, analysts say guidance for the coming quarters will loom as an important influence for stocks. Clarification over earnings provoked swings in a number of stocks on Tuesday.Seagate Technology said quarterly revenue and profitability would not meet its previous estimates, and the disk drive maker fell 6.2 per cent to $22.By contrast, Mylan Labs rose 2.8 per cent to $21.80 after it raised its fiscal 2007 earnings guidance, making it one of the better performing stocks in the S&P 500.The S&P closed up 0.25 per cent at 1,448.39 boosted by energy stocks, while the materials sector led weakness.A boost for the S&P was Applied Materials, up 4.1 per cent at $19.41 after Banc of America Securities upgraded the chip-equipment maker to a ‘buy’ from a ‘neutral’ rating.A weight on the S&P was Dow Chemical, 2.4 per cent lower at $45.51, as it fell back after a 5 per cent rise on Monday. The company said late on Monday it was not in talks about a possible buyout or takeover.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to close at 2,477.61.Chordiant Software rose 2.6 per cent to $12 after the maker of client software for businesses forecast a return to profitability for its fiscal second quarter.The Dow edged up 0.04 per cent to close at 12,573.85, and the bluechip barometer extended its run of gains to eight consecutive trading days.

By contrast, Hewlett-Packard, down 1.5 per cent at $40.72 and United Technologies, off 0.9 per cent at $64.45 were a weight on blue chips.Aside from the earnings picture, higher Treasury yields could also limit further gains in stocks, according to analysts at Banc of America Securities.“Faced with decelerating profits and competition from higher yields, stocks should continue in a corrective phase, with risks greatest in the consumer discretionary sector,” they said.In other earnings news, Mosaic fell 5.5 per cent to $27.51 after the maker of crop nutrients and animal feed missed fiscal third-quarter profit estimates.DR Horton lost 1.5 per cent to $21.70 after the homebuilder said its second-quarter sales orders fell 37 per cent. The company blamed steeper than expected declines in California and the Southwest.Analysts at S&P downgraded the company to a ‘sell’ from a ‘buy’ and cut their 12-month target price to $18 from $34 “to reflect our updated price-to-book analysis.”

In after-market trade, IBM was 4.5 per cent lower at $94.96.The bearish tone in chipmakers was set by Lam Research, which plunged

67;AMAT;Applied Materials;2006-12-06T20:29:19Z;Breaking the light barrier;;When it comes to solar power, there is no downside to getting too much sun.The poor efficiency of today’s photovoltaic solar panels means only between 8 and 20 per cent of the sun’s energy is converted into electricity.That’s what makes an announcement by the US Department of Energy so significant. A DoE-funded concentrator solar cell has broken the 40 per cent efficiency barrier for the first time.Produced by Boeing-Spectrolab, the cell achieved a world-record 40.7 per cent conversion efficiency through a system of layers that capture more of the sun’s spectrum.The DoE says this could cut installation costs to $3 per watt and produce electricity at a cost of 8 to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour (a coal-fired power station produces at about 4 cents per kw-hour).There is the usual lively discussion on Slashdot, and Applied Materials should take note. The Silicon Valley equipment maker recently announced a strategy aimed at reducing solar costs by two-thirds.Chris Nuttall, San Francisco

He was given the 2006 James C Morgan Global Humanitarian Award at a dinner at the Tech Museum in San Jose.
Introduced by MC Steve Young, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, Gates joked Young was all the things he was not – a great athlete, a college graduate ""and he’s never been in trouble….whereas I’ve had a few speeding tickets.""
He has obviously come a long way from his arrest in New Mexico for going through a stop sign in his Porsche.
On a serious note, he used his acceptance speech to urge the Valley’s top executives to consider philanthropy.
""All of us are very blessed, this gives us the opportunity of reducing inequity,"" he said.
Gates explained how he became involved in giving away much of his fortune when he was made aware that the science of preventing millions of deaths was not a problem, it was the lack of attention to it in affluent nations, where diseases such as malaria and Yellow Fever had disappeared.
"" Ninety per cent of money spent on health research is spent on the healthiest…there’s $1bn a year spent on baldness,"" he pointed out.
The Tech Museum Awards: Technology Benefiting Humanity, sponsored by Applied Materials, featured many projects in developing countries. Intel’s Environment Award was won by a project that made recycling plastic easier. Other projects included fog curtains that can collect up to 750 litres of drinking water a day and a sea-water greenhouse that provides fresh water and grows plants in Oman.
A full list of award winners is here.Chris Nuttall, San Jose"

73;AMAT;Applied Materials;2006-09-05T18:24:02Z;Applied Materials aims for solar sector;;Applied Materials, the world’s biggest tool provider for the semiconductor industry, is expanding into equipment for the booming solar energy industry.Applied launched its solar strategy in a webcast presentation on Tuesday, with Mike Splinter, chief executive, promising to reduce the cost per watt of generating solar power from $3-$5 down to $1.“We plan to change the cost equation for solar power through adaptation of our existing technology and new innovation in order to help make solar a more meaningful contributor to the global energy supply,” he said.Applied is entering the equipment market for photovoltaics – the direct conversion of the sun’s rays into electricity.In July, it completed the acquisition of Applied Films, a supplier of thin-film deposition equipment for solar cells, paying $464m - or $300m after taking into account its target’s cash on hand and equivalents.Most cells depend on silicon like the chip industry and thin-film coating materials being developed for panels can reduce the amount of silicon needed and make cells cheaper.The solar cell market is expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 35 to 40 per cent. Applied said the overall solar equipment market is expected to grow from around $1bn in 2006 to more than $3bn in 2010. It aimed to grab as much as 20 per cent of that market.“The solar industry has reached the inflection point that Applied Materials has been waiting for, as solar customers seek economies of scale with suppliers who can better meet their needs for global support,” said Mr Splinter.Applied plans to provide a combination of manufacturing tools, together with the technology and process innovations it has already developed for the semiconductor and flat-panel display industries.It said this would help its customers to increase conversion efficiency and yields on panels.In a Harris Interactive survey of US homeowners without solar power, commissioned by Applied, 87 per cent cited a variety of barriers to adopting it, with the cost of installation being the biggest hurdle.Applied shares were 0.2 per cent higher at $16.88 in midday trading in New York.

All the important indices suffered heavy losses, with the S&P 500 index falling to its lowest in two months. The Dow had its worst day since 2003.Investors were unsettled by the latest consumer price inflation data, which were stronger than expected and led the market to price in a greater chance of further interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve. The data reverberated across all sectors, striking the transport, finance and energy sectors hardest.?They are finally talking about the top-line number,? said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, referring to concern about both the headline index, which rose 0.6 per cent, and the core index, which was up 0.3 per cent.?The reason energy was taken out [of the core number] was because it was very volatile month to month. But for the last few years, crude has been trending up. This reaction is a shift in focus from the core to the top line.?At the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.7 per cent, or 21.76 points, at 1,270.32. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.5 per cent, or 33.33 points, at 2,195.80 ? its lowest level since November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.9 per cent, or 214.28 points, to 11,205.61, a one-month low.All sectors fell on the Big Board, with energy the biggest loser. Stocks of gasoline rose for the third consecutive week. BJ Services slumped 3.4 per cent to 34.75. ExxonMobil dropped 2.9 per cent to $60.18.The bellwether transport sector also took a hit, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average retreated from an all-time high set less than two weeks ago to fall more than 2.4 per cent in one day. It has now fallen 5.4 per cent in less than two weeks. Federal Express lost 4.8 per cent to $109.92, while Burlington Northern dipped 3.5 per cent to $76.13 and CSX shed 3.8 per cent to $68.09.Interest rate jitters afflicted the financial sector, with investment banks and brokerages particularly hard-hit.

E*Trade dropped 3.7 per cent to $24.05.Technology stocks fared less poorly, although they were still down for the day. Hewlett-Packard was a bright spot in the gloom. The shares gained 3.4 per cent to $32.16 after the computer maker reported a better-than-expected 51 per cent increase in second-quarter profit. Broadcom gained 3 per cent to $37.46 after an attorney from the International Trade Commission issued a non-binding briefing arguing that Qualcomm infringed two patents of Broadcom.Applied Materials was down 5.2 per cent at $16.93 in spite of reporting a 35 per cent rise in quarterly profit.
75;AMAT;Applied Materials;2006-05-16T22:59:55Z;Healthy chip industry boosts Applied Materials;;"Applied Materials, the biggest maker of equipment for chipmakers, reported revenues up by more than one-fifth and profits up more than one-third due to strong demand from an industry in its best health in years.Applied beat its own forecasts and market expectations with second-quarter sales of $2.25bn, 21 per cent higher than the previous quarter and a year earlier. Profits of $413m or 26 cents a share were up from $305m or 18 cents a share in its 2005 second quarter.Analysts had expected sales of $2.14bn and earnings of 23 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.Applied’s results provide an indication of the state of the semiconductor industry – it sells tools and equipment across a number of sectors and its orders are a measure of chipmakers’ confidence and growth levels.Applied said its order book grew 22 per cent over the previous quarter and 60 per cent on a year ago to $2.49bn. South Korea was responsible for 22 per cent of orders, Taiwan 19 per cent, North America 18 per cent, Japan 17 per cent, South-East Asia and China 14 per cent and Europe 10 per cent. Applied said that with 55 manufacturing plants in the works, there was good reason for optimism. “The industry is healthier than it has been in years and I’m confident that 2007 will be a year of continued capital expenditure expansion,” said Mike Splinter, chief executive, on a conference call.For its current quarter, Applied forecast revenues and orders would both be up 5 to 10 per cent on the second quarter and earnings per share should be in the range of 28 to 30 cents.“The growth rate of electronic products demand is increasing,” said Mr Splinter, citing Dataquest estimates of 7 per cent growth this year. “We believe these products are fundamental in growing economies and will continue to grow ahead
of GDP in years to come.” He said Applied’s customers had spent rationally on capacity and were maintaining high rates of utilisation. The company would continue to expand its equipment offering in new areas such as the solar industry and flat-panel televisions.Applied’s shares were down 3.7 per cent in after-hours trading at $17.18 after closing 0.8 per cent higher."
76;AMAT;Applied Materials;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Tech companies want US-China aviation rules eased;;A coalition of technology companies, including Intel and IBM, are calling for restrictions on US-China flights to be eased after a shortage of capacity forced manufacturers to charter aircraft for shipments.The High-Tech Shippers’ Council has been granted observer status at bilateral aviation talks between the US and China starting on Tuesday in Washington, part of the wider trade discussions accompanying the US visit of President Hu Jintao. These aim to build on the landmark 2004 deal which opened the way for a five-fold increase in the number of flights between the two countries by 2009.The talks are usually restricted to government officials and representatives from the air transport industry. The invitation highlights the problems facing shippers in the fast-growing market, with airborne exports from the US to China rising three-fold between 2000 and 2004.“What we’d like to see is agreement by the two countries for even greater expansion,” said Steve Harper, Intel’s director of government affairs and the council’s co-chairman. The peak fourth-quarter shipping season for Intel’s semiconductors forced the company and other tech rivals to use more expensive charter flights as there was insufficient capacity in the bellies of passenger aircraft.The council, with backing from members including Solectron, Applied Materials and Sun Microsystems, will join US passenger and cargo carriers at this week’s talks in seeking to accelerate the timetable for increased service granted under the 2004 deal.However, while Chinese carriers are generally in favour of further deregulation, they are currently not using their full allocation of flights to the US as airlines await new aircraft deliveries and focus attention on alternative routes ahead of the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Lenovo, which bought IBM’s PC business last year, is the only Chinese member of the shippers’ council, but has not been active in the current campaign.

Lam Research rose 4.6 per cent to $46.77 and Applied Materials gained 3.9 per cent to $18.10.Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices, delivered stronger than expected first-quarter earnings, but the stock tumbled 10.2 per cent to $31.80 after Sanford C. Bernstein downgraded the stock, citing among other things, concerns over AMD’s weak second-quarter guidance.Still in the technology sector, IBM rose 1.5 per cent to $81.98 after Lehman Brothers raised its price target on the stock from $90 to $92.Shares in SanDisk shot up 4.1 to $61.90 after Standard & Poor’s announced that the maker of flash-memory products will replace Chiron Corp in its benchmark index.Gains on the Dow were limited by General Electric, which fell after it reported earnings that failed to inspire investors. Profits at the giant conglomerate rose 14 per cent in the first quarter, in line with forecasts and the company also affirmed its 2006 guidance.But the stock, which has risen more than 1.5 per cent over the last two sessions, dropped 1.7 per cent to $33.89 as investors moved to lock in profits.“The lack of earnings upside may be modestly disappointing given recent positive preannouncements by Ill Tool Works, 3M, and Danaher,” said Deane Dray, analyst at Goldman Sachs. Goldman maintained its “outperform” rating on the stock, however, saying that it believes “the pendulum is swinging towards favouring GE’s long-cycle and services business mix.”Also on the Dow, McDonald’s retreated 1 per cent to $34.85 in spite of beating market expectations with its 6.6 per cent rise in March same-store sales.

Signs of steady corporate earnings growth further added steam to the rally to help the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 build on their multi-year highs.The Dow closed 0.4 per cent higher at 11.253.24, while the S&P 500, boosted by gains in the energy stocks, advanced 0.2 per cent to 1,305.33. The Nasdaq, fell 0.5 per cent, however, to 2,299.56.Steep losses from chipmakers weighed heavily on the Nasdaq. The Philadelphia semiconductor index slumped 3.2 per cent, led by Applied Material’s 4.7 per cent retreat to $17.70 and Texas Instrument’s 3.6 per cent decline to $30.15.The technology-heavy index was also dragged down by Apple Computer, which shed 2.9 per cent to $64.31 after Bear Stearns cut its price target from $103 to $100 on the iPod maker. The broker cited reports of slowing sales of Apple’s personal computers in January and February.By contrast, energy stocks made broad advances after oil prices jumped on supply concerns following the US’s air assault on Iraq.

Net income rose 30 per cent to $1.227bn, helped by its restructuring efforts and higher personal computer sales.Deutsche Bank, Banc of America Securities and Bear Stearns all raised their price targets for the stock while Credit Suisse upgraded its recommendation on the shares from “neutral” to “outperform”.“We still like the HP story and think the stock has room for additional upside potential,” said Keith Bachman, a BofA analyst, in a research note.The broader technology sector appeared to benefit from HP’s strong performance. The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent higher at 2,294.63 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 11,120.68 - its highest level since May 2001. The S&P 500, buoyed by gains in the energy sector, advanced 0.7 per cent to 1,289.63.The gains came despite a rebound in crude prices and renewed worries that the current strength seen in the US economy would prompt the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates.“We need good numbers but not too strong numbers,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist, AG Edwards & Sons. “But this week we have seen some pretty strong number in capacity utilisation, retail sales and housing starts.”Internet stocks were heavily traded, with Google and Ebay moving to the upside while Amazon and Expedia traded in the red.News that the number of sponsored link advertising impressions on Google grew 16 percent helped lift shares in the internet search engine out of its recent slump. After skidding almost 26 per cent in the last four weeks, Google bounced back 7 per cent to $366.46.By contrast, shares in Expedia plunged 18.3 per cent to $19.82 after the online travel company said quarterly profit fell 43 per cent.Boston Scientific, which is working to close a $27bn acquisition of rival medical device maker Guidant, moved up 8.7 per cent after its finance chief bought up 200,000 shares of the company for $4.5m. UBS analyst Kenneth Weakley, in a research note, said the purchase was “a positive sign on the value of the stock.”On other earnings news, Applied Materials, which makes equipment used to make computer chips, fell despite topping analyst forecasts with its fourth-quarter earnings.Although Citigroup and UBS both lifted their price estimates on the stock to $25, its shares fell 2.4 per cent to $19.96 on profit-taking after Goldman Sachs advised clients to sell the stock, citing valuation concerns.Network Appliance, the computer data storage company, jumped 7.8 per cent to $33.58 on the back of higher quarterly earnings.Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell more than 6 per cent to $14.51 after it reported a loss of $51m.Despite a weak start to last year’s holiday shopping season Target and JC Penney both delivered strong fourth-quarter earnings.

The stock was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” and gained 1.1 per cent to $33.86.Bear Stearns rose 1.6 per cent to $131.61 after Merrill raised its rating from “neutral” to “buy”. The broker said potential earnings’ growth was not reflected fully in Bear Stearns’ share price.Applied Materials, the world’s largest chip equipment maker, gained 1 per cent to $20.46 in advance of the release of its results after the close.Michael O’Brien at Bear Stearns said: “We want to remind investors that we expect the company to easily beat all guidance, and expect further share price appreciation as investors increasingly realise that the cycle has sustainability.”Abercrombie & Fitch, the clothing retailer, reported a 58 per cent rise in fourth quarter profit, but the shares fell 2.1 per cent to $67.33 after the company warned full-year earnings expectations were unlikely to be met.Myers Industries, the plastics manufacturer, said currency effects hit fourth-quarter net profit, but shares leapt 7.1 per cent to $15.42 after it said it might sell non-core assets.Legg Mason Capital Management revealed in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had built up a 25 per cent stake in Eastman Kodak, making it the photographic company’s biggest shareholder.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,266.98.Cisco Systems, the world’s biggest maker of networking equipment, rose 7.2 per cent to $19.40 after John Chambers, chief executive, was unexpectedly upbeat about third-quarter sales. This came after the company reported, following the close on Tuesday, a 1.8 per cent fall in fiscal second-quarter net profit. Cisco had been hit by the cost of compensation expenses related to employee stock options.“Cisco maintained 10-12 per cent full-year revenue guidance, which we believe is more comfortably achievable given the broad-based demand uptick,” said Nikos Theodosopoulos, strategist at UBS.Elsewhere among technology stocks, Dell, the computer maker, rose 6.2 per cent to $31.52 after broker Sanford Bernstein upgraded it to “outperform” from “market perform”. The broker said Dell was capable of delivering between 13 and 15 per cent earnings-per-share growth for several years to come.Rival Hewlett-Packard climbed 5.4 per cent to $32.01, while IBM added 1.4 per cent to $80.80.Semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials gained 3.1 per cent to $20.10 after Banc of America upgraded the stock to “neutral” from “sell”, in anticipation of a surge in orders for flash memory chips.Pfizer helped boost the pharmaceuticals sector after it said it may sell its consumer products division, which includes such brands as Listerine mouthwash and Sudafed cold remedies.

Procter & Gamble added 0.3 per cent to $59.47.PepsiCo, the food and drinks group, gained 0.7 per cent to $57.28 after it reported a 12 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net profit thanks to overseas sales growth and strong gains in snack items and non-carbonated drinks sales.The results were in line with market expectations, and the company said it would aim to buy back $3bn in shares over the coming year.General Motors was the biggest faller on the Dow, off 3.6 per cent to $21.99 after Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to “sell” from “hold”, citing a number of uncertainties.The broker’s analysts were “disappointed” by the limited cash savings targeted in the company’s restructuring plan.
82;AMAT;Applied Materials;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Stability gives SAP the edge over Oracle;;SAP, the world’s largest business software maker, is profiting from acquisitions by Oracle, its US rival, as customers appear to be banking on the stability of the German company rather than committing to its fast-expanding competitor.Contracts signed between the start of July and the end of September with companies such as Applied Materials in the US and Allianz in Germany boosted SAP’s software sales. Revenues in the third quarter were €590m ($707m), 20 per cent higher than the same period in 2004. Analysts had predicted a 12 per cent rise.Henning Kagermann, chief executive, said SAP was outbidding Oracle because “there is uncertainty about what our competitor is doing in the future and [whether it] can deliver”. While Oracle was “stitching together companies”, SAP’s “organic growth” gave stability. This was driving sales.SAP this year aims to hire 4,500 staff and launch products for smaller firms. Oracle, by contrast, has spent billions buying competitors such as PeopleSoft to rival SAP in the business management market. SAP said its market share had still grown by two points to 60 per cent worldwide since June – and by three points to 44 per cent in the US.“We are putting more distance between ourselves and the competition,” Mr Kagermann said.“It looks as though SAP is expanding its roots in sectors in which it was already the dominant vendor,” said Adam Shepherd at Dresdner Kleinwort Wassserstein. “It is raising sales as these clients favour the known quantity SAP over Oracle – though it is not carving chunks out of Oracle’s strong business with financial institutions.”SAP said software licence sales would rise 12-14 per cent in 2005, up from a mid-year forecast of 10-12 per cent. Total revenue in the quarter rose 13 per cent to €2.01bn, and pro-forma operating income, which excludes stock-options, increased 9 per cent to €520m.Sergio Giacoletto, Oracle’s vice president for Europe, said the US company stood by its goal to become the number one in business management. SAP “was very proud to have poached some of our clients but it was only a few of a whole host,” he told FTDeutschland, the FT’s sister paper. “Customers usually don’t switch that easily.”Additional reporting by Thomas Fromm in Munich
83;AMAT;Applied Materials;2005-08-17T21:03:16Z;Market Overview: Earnings perk up equities;;Further evidence of a stronger-than-expected US earnings season inspired a rally on Wall Street on Wednesday and stemmed losses on European bourses.Inflation fears over high oil prices were put to one side as US investors were cheered by positive earnings surprises from Hewlett-Packard and Applied Materials.The tech-heavy Nasdaq index was up 0.4 per cent to 2,145.15 the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 10,550.71 and the S&P 500 gained 0.1 to 1,220.24.The rally came in spite of further poor news on the inflation front after higher-than-expected consumer prices data on Tuesday triggered a slide in share prices.Data on Wednesday showed US producer prices rose 1 per cent in July, double the forecasts for an increase of 0.5 per cent, as oil prices continued to rise. Excluding energy and food costs, core producer prices advanced by 0.4 per cent, well above forecasts for a modest 0.1 per cent rise.Economists said the data added to the case for the US Federal Reserve to continue raising its benchmark interest rate above 4 per cent.However, the impact of the data was partially offset by a retreat in oil prices on profit-taking, despite news of higher-than-expected drawdown on gasoline inventories last week. West Texas Intermediate for September delivery fell $2.83 to $63.25.Elsewhere, there was news on the other side of the Atlantic to disappoint those looking for rate cuts. The release of minutes of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee showed that governor Mervyn King opposed the decision this month to cut interest rates.Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Gerrard, said the minutes were the most remarkable on record, showing an unexpected split between MPC members over the rate decision. Only five of the nine MPC members voted for the rise.“For the first time since its inception in 1997, the governor of the MPC was in the minority camp opposing the outcome of the meeting. In the process, he stood apart from the bank’s chief economist, Charles Bean, who supported the case for a further easing,” he said.David Rosenberg, North American economist for Merrill Lynch, said: “Imagine if this ever happened at the Fed.”The damped rate cut hopes saw the UK market retreat for the fifth successive session. The FTSE 100 fell 0.6 to 5,292.7, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 Index retreated 0.2 per cent to 1,186.1. However, both indices ended above session lows after the Wall Street rally. The MPC minutes provided support to the pound, which hit a six-week high against the euro and held its ground against a strong dollar.Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch cast doubt on one factor that has been a recent source of support for markets – a second-quarter earnings season that has been widely seen as strong.In a note headlined “Not as good as you think”, Khuram Chaudhry, quantitative research strategist, said the level of better than expected results had been surprisingly good. However, the proportion of companies reporting increasing earnings growth was falling.“We believe this is a trend worth paying attention to. In an environment fraught with macro risks (rising oil prices and higher interest rates) like today, corporate profit deceleration is a theme with considerable longevity,” he said.“We are seeing an extraordinary scenario of the Fed tightening into a corporate earnings deterioration, undoubtedly a poor combination for profits and equity performance.”
84;AMAT;Applied Materials;2005-08-17T20:27:42Z;Wall Street defies producer prices data;;Wall Street shrugged off disappointing economic news on Wednesday and staged a gentle rally as computer-related stocks performed well.Figures showing that inflation rose twice as fast as expected in July did not stop the three main indices bouncing back after a dismal day’s trading on Tuesday, with strong results from Hewlett-Packard helping them along.By the close of trading the company’s shares had soared by 13.2 per cent to $26.82 after the second largest computer maker reported major progress under Mark Hurd, new chief executive. The company’s results, which signalled a winding-down of the current earnings season, saw both sales and profits exceed expectations with Wall Street analysts rushing to increase their estimates for the company.The company’s performance sparked a rally among other computer makers and chip equipment manufacturers. Dell, HP’s main rival, which reported disappointing results last month, gained 0.6 per cent to $36.92. Apple rose 2 per cent to $47.15 and even the increasingly enfeebled Gateway, which on Monday cut its revenue and profit estimates for the year, saw its price grow by 5.5 per cent to $3.28.Applied Materials, the world’s biggest maker of equipment used to produce semiconductors, issued a stronger-than-expected forecast for its bookings as its quarterly profit edged out analysts’ forecasts. Shares gained 6.1 per cent to $18.22.All of which helped the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rise 0.4 per cent to 2,145.15 by the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 10,550.71 and the S&P 500 gained 0.1 per cent to 1,220.24.Arthur Hogan, chief US equity analyst at Jefferies & Co, said the good news from the technology sector had helped the market recover from its “knee-jerk reaction” to disappointing retail sales on Tuesday.A dramatic fall in oil prices – down $2.83 to a close of $63.25 a barrel – also bolstered the market. Official data showed a rise in crude supplies rose, pushing inventories above the average for this time of year.“HP, combined with a pullback in energy prices, really helped the psychology of investors and outweighed the slight increase in prices,” Mr Hogan said.The fall in oil was less good for energy companies. Among the fallers was Chevron, which dropped 1.4 per cent to $59.64.While HP was the last Dow Jones indexed company to post its results in the current quarter, the markets will soon be turning their attention to a spate of results from retailers.Abercrombie & Fitch got proceedings off to an inauspicious start after the fashion chain missed analysts’ estimates and saw its shares drop 3.9 per cent to $58.85.The markets should expect more of the same, Merrill Lynch warned, saying a decline in retail stocks could continue into September as higher interest rates and energy costs begin to erode the spending power of US consumers.
85;AMAT;Applied Materials;2005-06-01T21:49:36Z;Applied files for China holding company status;;Applied Materials, the biggest maker of tools for the semiconductor industry, has applied for coveted holding company status in China.If the application is successful, Applied will be able to act as if it were a Chinese company in structuring its business, forming joint ventures and offering a wider array of services.Pending approval of the application, Applied said it planned to open a “Global Development Capability” centre in Xi'an that would provide engineering and software support services to other locations around the world.David Wang, president of Applied Materials Asia, said: “Xi'an is an excellent location…due to the number of local universities and research institutions, broad base of engineering and manufacturing companies, low operating costs and strong local government support.”Applied has had a presence in China since 1984 and currently employs 300 people in five locations. China is becoming increasingly important as a semiconductor manufacturing centre.
86;AMAT;Applied Materials;2005-05-17T22:35:29Z;Applied Materials profit tumbles by 18%;;Quarterly profits at Applied Materials, the largest supplier of chipmaking equipment, declined by 18 per cent to $305m as semiconductor companies continued to delay capital spending.Mike Splinter, chief executive, said Applied had gained significant share in a market that remained “at best mixed”.Revenues, orders and earnings were expected to decline further in the current quarter, he said.Applied shares lost 28 cents to $15.76 following the announcement, which came after the close of regular trading in New York.The US-based company sells equipment to many of the world's largest chipmakers, including Intel and Samsung. It is also a leading supplier to contract manufacturers or “foundries” such as TSMC and UMC of Taiwan, and SMIC of China.“The market is beginning to display some positive signs but foundry utilisation rates may not be rising fast enough to trigger capex [capital spending],” Mr Splinter said.Revenues in the three months to April declined 8 per cent to $1.86bn from $2.02bn. Earnings per share were 18 cents, down from 22 cents. New orders declined by 30 per cent to $1.55bn.Although underlying demand for personal computers, mobile phones and other electronic devices remains strong, the outlook for chipmakers is clouded by excess manufacturing capacity and inventory.Nancy Handel, chief financial officer, said new orders would fall by 5-10 per cent sequentially during the current quarter, with revenues down 10-15 per cent.Earnings per share would be 12-14 cents, she said. Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of 17 cents.Under Mr Splinter, chief executive since 2003, Applied has been diversifying into LCD display-making equipment and services. Last year, it paid $85m to acquire Metron Technology, a supplier of specialist cleaning and maintenance services to chipmakers.Mr Splinter said the flat-panel display business had its third consecutive quarter of record orders and accounted for about 10 per cent of the group's total business.At the end of April, Applied had $6.4bn cash on its balance sheet, despite having repurchased $1.3bn worth of stock over the preceeding nine months. In March, the group announced it would start paying a 3 cents quarterly dividend, its first in more than 30 years as a listed company.
87;AMAT;Applied Materials;2005-03-24T22:41:11Z;Yahoo reveals $3bn share buyback;;Yahoo on Thursday became the first big internet company to launch a large-scale stock buy-back program, extending a slow but distinct new trend among technology companies to return more of their excess cash to shareholders.The move came a day after Applied Materials, the biggest producer of chip-making equipment, announced the payment of its first-ever dividend.Yahoo said it would buy back $3bn of its shares over the next five years, out of working capital. The company's operating cashflow last year more than doubled to $1.1bn, while its holdings of cash and marketable securities at the end of last year reached $4.6bn.?The cash productivity of our business model enables us to actively invest cash in areas that we believe will drive future value for shareholders, such as stock repurchases,? said Terry Semel, chairman and chief executive officer.Like many tech companies, Yahoo had earlier used stock buy-backs in only a limited way, primarily to repurchase shares issued under its employee stock option plan. It launched its first repurchase programme, for $500m, in 2001.More recently, some companies have ramped up their repurchases in response to criticism from Wall Street that the tech industry needs to adjust its financial strategy to the more mature, slow-growth world that has followed the boom of the 1990s. Earlier this month, Dell said it would buy back $10bn worth of its shares and accelerate the rate of its repurchases.While adding to its cash reserves, Yahoo has also been investing more heavily in product development and acquisitions to extend its reach on the internet and fend off heightened competition from rivals such as Google and Microsoft. Last year it spent $756m on acquisitions, net of the cash held by the companies it bought.Earlier this week, Yahoo announced the acquisition of Ludicorp, the group behind Flickr, a popular photo-sharing website, in a move to capture part of the burgeoning market for storing and sorting images. Yahoo's shares, which had fallen more than 20 per cent from a 4?-year high of $39.14 in December, rose 1.8 per cent on Thursday to $31.11.Meanwhile, Applied Materials' decision to pay a regular quarterly dividend of 3 cents a share, while also increasing its own buy-back program from $3bn to $4bn, echoed similar moves in the last two years by Microsoft and Qualcomm, among others. Since 2002, the number of tech companies paying dividends has risen by 60 per cent, according to research by Sanford C. Bernstein.However, dividends remain a rarity in the tech world, with five out of six still not paying out cash to their shareholders this way, according to Bernstein. Last week desktop software maker Adobe said it would scrap its dividend and use the money instead to buy back shares, a move that it said represented a more efficient way to return cash. Using its current share price, Applied Material's dividend payment gives its shares a yield of 0.7 per cent.
88;AMAT;Applied Materials;2005-03-08T22:13:14Z;SMIC failure over loan threatens US deal;;Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), China's largest maker of computer chips, has threatened to buy billions of dollars of chip-making equipment from Japan instead of the US after failing to secure a loan guarantee from the US Export-Import Bank.In a letter addressed to Ex-Im Bank last month, a copy of which the FT has seen, Marco Mora, SMIC's chief operating officer, expressed dismay at the Ex-Im Bank's reluctance to back the purchase of $870m (?658m, ?454m) of equipment from US suppliers and said SMIC had been approached by the governments of other countries, including Japan.The letter said a partnership with Japanese vendors and the government in Tokyo for the projects would make it hard for SMIC to buy from US sellers in the future. ?This would represent a potential loss in revenues for US-based equipment vendors of over $5bn.? The US Ex-Im Bank, a government agency that provides low-cost financing to support some US exports, has so far refused to act on a request from Applied Materials, a California-based producer of chip-making equipment. The bank said the request had not been formally rejected, but was not scheduled for consideration.The financing is opposed by Micron Technology, an Idaho-based chip-maker whose supporters in Congress include an Idaho congressman who heads a sub-committee overseeing Ex-Im Bank operations.SMIC declined to comment on Tuesday and Mr Mora was unavailable. It is understood that SMIC planned to buy much of the high-technology equipment from Applied Materials with the help of a syndicated loan led by Citigroup, and that the exports would need the approval of the US Commerce Department.The syndicate is believed to have offered the bulk of the credit needed by the Chinese company. However, if SMIC decided to switch to Japanese suppliers, it is almost certain the Citigroup-led syndicate would lose the loan to Japanese rivals.Citigroup declined to comment on Tuesday. However, SMIC's letter to the US authorities was copied to Valentino Gallo, Citigroup's global manager for structured trade finance and a member of Ex-Im bank's advisory committee. Trade finance loans can be rewarding for banks as they command higher-than-average interest rates and demanding repayment schedules.Additional reporting by David Pilling in Tokyo, Mure Dickie in Beijing and Edward Alden in Washington
89;AMAT;Applied Materials;2005-02-15T23:34:46Z;Applied expects sales to rise later this year;;Applied Materials, the largest provider of chip-making equipment, said on Tuesday it expected tool sales to improve in the second half of 2005 as its customers increased their capital expenditure.Applied's equipment sales are a barometer of the level of confidence in the industry, with chipmakers reining in spending on new equipment when they fear falling demand, prices and overcapacity.Mike Splinter, chief executive, told an analysts' conference call covering first-quarter results that Applied was encouraged by recent public announcements by its customers on capex for the year ahead.?It's shifted up to roughly flat for the calendar year,? he said.The industry has been going through a mini-slump caused by inventory build-ups and Applied reported new orders fell to $1.68bn in the quarter to January 30 a 36 per cent decrease on the previous quarter.It suggested a bottoming out of the trend, with a forecast of orders being flat to down 10 per cent in the second quarter, compared with the first.First-quarter sales of $1.78bn were down 19 per cent quarter-on-quarter and net profits fell 37 per cent to $289m, or 17 cents a share. The results were slightly ahead of guidance and market expectations.The equipment maker forecast second-quarter sales would be flat to slightly up on the first quarter and earnings would be 16 to 17 cents a share.Applied has benefited from the re-tooling needed in the move from 200mm diameter to higher-yielding 300mm wafers and to thinner 90 and 65 nanometre technologies.?Sixty-five nanometre will require an estimated 60 per cent more equipment dollars than 130nm, so we expect equipment spending will exceed [overall] capital spending for the foreseeable future,? said Mr Splinter.He added that Applied would also be supplying more equipment to memory chip makers moving to faster DDR2 memory. The D-Ram and Flash markets were strong, with no inventory build-ups, and the move to DDR2 would require more complex processes and equipment, he said.
90;AMAT;Applied Materials;2004-11-24T18:18:24Z;Chipmakers predict 2005 demand drop;;Chipmakers warned on Wednesday of a global industry slowdown in 2005 as the latest statistics on production showed a first decline in almost two years.STMicroelectronics, Europe's biggest semiconductor maker, said the market would be depressed in the first half of 2005 before picking up in the second.Alan Dutheil, strategic planning vice-president, said at a conference in Paris that there would be a two-quarter correction in inventories by electronics component distributors, which had overestimated their needs.His comments were endorsed at the same conference by David Dunn, the retiring chief executive of ASML, Europe's largest semiconductor equipment maker.?I think we're going to have a slowdown, transition point, a mid-point correction, as some call it, for a few quarters, only two or three quarters, then I think it will lift up again,? he told reporters.?After these periods of strong growth in the market, there is a bit of an overshoot, so right now we are facing a period of inventory corrections which will last at least two quarters.?The Semiconductor International Capacity Statistics (SICAS) group said on Wednesday that the utilisation rate for chip factories fell from 95.4 per cent in the three months to June to 92.7 per cent in the September quarter the first quarterly decline in almost two years.If factories are under- utilised, manufacturers will delay building new plants hitting the order books of toolmakers such as ASML and Applied Materials, the world's biggest chip equipment maker.Applied reported its best financial year since 2000 last week as chipmakers invested heavily in new plants, in particular the latest 300mm wafer plants that offer higher yields and bigger profit margins than their 200mm predecessors.But Applied warned that orders in its first quarter would fall 35 per cent as demand collapsed for 200mm plant equipment.The industry has become concerned at the build-up in inventory levels by distributors and is nervously eyeing the level of consumer spending over the next few weeks on items such as mobile phones, digital music players and cameras.Mike Splinter, Applied's chief executive, said: ?Everybody is looking to see how Christmas selling goes in consumer products. We are in a four to six-week period of a reassessment into what the industry is going to look like next year.?
91;AMAT;Applied Materials;2004-11-18T21:38:48Z;Wall Street stocks take a breather;;"Wall Street finished an uninspiring session marginally higher on Thursday as technology shares shrugged off a cautious outlook from Applied Materials and the broader market flirted with extending recent gains.By the close the S&P 500 index was 0.1 per cent up at 1,183.56. The Nasdaq Composite index inched up 0.2 per cent to 2,104.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent up at 10,572.55, mosrtly thanks to Altria Group.Stocks have enjoyed a prolonged rally and have yet to experience a retrenchment that even bulls admit will be needed before the market can climb further. Optimists say such a retreat would be healthy and see it only as a pause en route to further gains.The present rally has lasted 17 sessions and approaches the four consecutive weeks noted by some traders as the average lifespan of so-called buyer panic rallies, which the current rally resembles. During such advances, trading volumes rise alongside share prices, indicating that investors buy stocks motivated primarily by the fear of missing out on gains.However, Louise Yamada and Ron Daino of the technical research team at Smith Barney have pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reversed a medium-term sell indication into a buy signal. They add that all other equity market indices are giving similar signals and said their initial target for the Dow is 11,300, about 6.4 per cent from its level on Thursday.Among mostly tepid performances for Dow stocks, Altria Group shares put on 2.2 per cent to $58.70 after an upgrade by Goldman Sachs and Prudential analysts who were sceptical that a government lawsuit against the tobacco industry would succeed.

93;AMAT;Applied Materials;2004-11-17T23:51:59Z;Applied says its ?best' year will not last;;Applied Materials recorded its best financial year since 2000 as chipmakers invested heavily in new plants. However, the company warned 2005 would start slower as customers became increasing cautious about capital investment.Applied, whose equipment orders signal the level of optimism and competition among chipmakers, said it had proved itself the clear industry leader as orders more than doubled year-on-year to October 31 to $9bn. But it predicted orders for the first quarter would fall 35 per cent.Mike Splinter, chief executive, said some customers had become more cautious in response to concerns about their inventories building up and had significantly slowed investment in 200mm manufacturing. Next-generation 300mm wafer plants accounted for 84 per cent of orders in the fourth quarter. He cited industry estimates of capital spending being flat to 10 per cent down in 2005.Applied, the world's biggest chip equipment maker, said new orders of $2.62bn for the fourth quarter were up seven per cent on the $2.46bn in the third. It had forecast growth of five per cent.Cristina Osmena, semiconductor analyst at Jefferies & Company, said Applied had outperformed its competitors, whose growth had been at best flat in the quarter, and this had made its first quarter forecast look worse.?[A 35 per cent fall] is a shocking number but what I saw them doing was taking orders as much as they could in the October quarter so they would have them in backlog instead of having to compete for them in a more challenging environment,? she said.Orders were up 105 per cent on the $1.28bn recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. Net sales for the year increased 79 per cent to $8bn and earnings per share were 78 cents compared with a loss of 9 cents in 2003.Fourth-quarter sales were down 1 per cent on the third quarter at $2.20bn, but up 80 per cent on a year earlier. Earnings of 27 cents per share were slightly ahead of analysts' expectations of 26 cents.Gross margins were 46.6 per cent, down from 47.4 per cent in the third quarter and up from 40.5 per cent a year ago.Applied shares fell 2.9 per cent to $16.84 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. They had closed 3.6 per cent higher before the announcement.
94;AMAT;Applied Materials;2004-11-02T23:47:57Z;Applied Materials sales surge in China;;Applied Materials, the largest supplier of semi-conductor manufacturing equipment, said its sales in China in the 12 months to October this year would be about $1bn, representing a 10-fold increase in four years.The China sales amount to 10-15 per cent of the US company's global sales in its fiscal year, a reflection of the surge in investment in the mainland, especially around Shanghai, in the semi-conductor industry.Mike Splinter, president and chief executive, said the company expected equipment spending in China to maintain long-term growth, expanding perhaps five to six times over the next six years to the end of the decade.?Our industry has its ups and downs but I think it is going to continue to grow,? he said in an interview.Mr Splinter said China was about one to two generations behind in semiconductor technology but was already catching up fast with rivals in the US, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Europe.?In a generation, they have closed the gap at least half a generation they have caught up by a year and a half,? he said. A ?generation? is a two- to three-year cycle.?That lead [held by non-Chinese] will shrink over time,? he added.China wants to develop its semiconductor industry to ensure its economy has access to, and the skills to produce, the world's best technology, and also to cut its import bills. The country now imports about a quarter of the chips used in goods assembled in factories in the country.US government restrictions on the export of high-tech goods to countries such as China had so far not hindered Applied Materials' business there, Mr Splinter said.?These countries are going to get that technology, and so it gets down to whether they are going to allow US companies to participate in that business,? he said.Shanghai and the surrounding Yangtze delta region has the largest cluster of wafer plants, developed by local engineers and also professionals lured mainly from Taiwan and the US.Mr Splinter said China faced a challenge in building other centres for semiconductor manufacturing because many professionals, especially non-Chinese, were reluctant to live in places other than Shanghai.He said Applied Materials had considered manufacturing semiconductor-making equipment in China but had not decided to do so yet.Most of its manufacturing is based in Austin, Texas.
