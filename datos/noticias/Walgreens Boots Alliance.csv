1;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2019-11-12T05:00:28Z;Walgreens buyout would be a test of bond investors’ appetite;Mooted takeover by KKR comes as borrowing costs are low but fears of risky deals persist;KKR’s proposal to acquire Walgreens Boots Alliance sets up a test for debt markets, where a tide of cash has sent borrowing costs lower but investors have worried about risky deals. The listed pharmacy group carries about $15bn in net debt, accounting for about one-fifth of its enterprise value. But a private equity-backed takeover would typically entail borrowing far more: when KKR bought Alliance Boots in 2007, the firm leaned on credit markets for as much as 80 per cent of the £11.1bn acquisition price.Raising enough debt to fund a similar leveraged buyout of the $70bn Walgreens business presents a challenge that “would be overwhelming”, said David Norris, head of US credit at TwentyFour Asset Management. Much would depend on whether Walgreens could retain an investment-grade rating for at least part of the debt, gaining access to the $8tn investment-grade bond market, which some analysts believe is essential for capital-raising on this scale. Walgreens’ bonds are rated BBB or equivalent by major rating agencies, which have yet to respond to news of a potential deal. Moody’s in August held its rating, noting that “operating performance has been weak but fundamentals remain strong”.With the current state of the high-yield bond market it’s a big nut to digestNews of a potential takeover hit Walgreens’ bonds, with a 10-year note falling 2 cents on Friday ahead of the Veterans Day market holiday to trade at 101 cents on the dollar.That is slightly above the bond’s original sale value, and close to the value at which Walgreens would have to buy back the bonds in the event of a change of control, according to Covenant Review, a credit research group.Investment-grade corporate credit has been one of the most sought-after investments in recent years, but the surge of interest has raised questions over whether risks are building in the market.The premium demanded by investors over super-safe US Treasury bonds has fallen from 1.6 per cent in January to 1.1 per cent currently, according to data from Bloomberg.The junk bond market is much smaller than that for investment-grade debt, however, and some investors doubt it could support a Walgreens acquisition. A $50bn capital raising would represent about 5 per cent of the value of all outstanding junk bonds. While Verizon, Anheuser-Busch InBev and CVS have all issued investment-grade bonds worth $40bn or above, the biggest high-yield bond financing ever was far smaller: completed by French company Numericable Group in 2014, it was for just shy of $11bn, according to Dealogic data. “With the current state of the high-yield bond market it’s a big nut to digest,” said Mr Norris of a Walgreens deal. “They will have to come up with some innovative financing.”Maintaining the investment-grade rating would be a rare feat for a private equity-backed firm, but there is at least one apparent precedent in Dell’s $63bn purchase of computer storage company EMC in 2016. By pledging assets as security, the junk-rated group was able to raise some of the money through a $20bn investment-grade bond. Still, some market participants believe KKR has struck at a moment when junk bond investors are so hungry for yield they may be willing to bite into what would be the biggest private equity deal on record — so long as investor protections are adequate and the credit rating is towards the top end of junk territory. Borrowing costs for the highest rung of the junk bond ladder, rated double-B, hit a six-year low of 3.96 per cent at the end of October on strong investor demand, even as lower-rated, triple-C bonds have risen to trade above 12 per cent from a low earlier in the year of 10.5 per cent.“It’s a little surprising we haven’t seen more mega LBOs,” said a high-yield bond trader. “This is certainly untested but there is demand in the market. I would not be surprised if it goes through.”
2;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2019-11-11T16:59:57Z;Walgreens Boots receives $70bn buyout proposal from KKR;KKR would need to collaborate with other investors to pull off biggest PE transaction;Walgreens Boots Alliance, the $70bn drugstore chain, has received a buyout proposal from the private equity group KKR, a deal that would be the biggest private equity transaction on record.The approach, just three years after KKR sold the last of its shares in Walgreens from a previous buyout, was outlined in a document shared with the company’s board, according to people briefed on the matter.KKR would need to collaborate with other investors to pull off a deal, which would dwarf the record-breaking $45bn acquisition of energy company TXU in 2007. One person close to the private equity group said that it was also talking to a number of its own investors to explore their interest in participating in the transaction. Another person said that Walgreens’ senior management would also contribute to the deal. Chief executive Stefano Pessina, the pharmacy tycoon who assembled Walgreens Boots Alliance through a string of mergers, owns about 16 per cent of the company. Those briefed on the discussions cautioned that no final decision had been taken and that either side could still walk away. It might be possible. It’s a huge stretch doing things over $50bnWalgreens shares fell nearly 20 per cent between January and the end of October, before news of a potential buyout emerged. They rose 6 per cent on Monday after Bloomberg first reported news of KKR’s formal offer for the drugstore group, giving the company an equity market value of about $56bn. It has net debt of about $15bn. KKR and Walgreens declined to comment.Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of Blackstone, said last week that a deal to take Walgreens private deal would be a “stretch” given current market conditions. “It might be possible. It’s a huge stretch doing things over $50bn,” Mr Schwarzman said at a Reuters conference in New York. “You need at least $20bn of equity. Could you find that in today’s world? Maybe. Thirty billion of debt you could probably get. It’s a little tougher on the equity.”Walgreens is also grappling with tough trading conditions. The pharmacy group is battling against a new breed of competitors and has promised to save $1.8bn a year in costs by 2022 by closing stores and laying off employees.KKR backed Mr Pessina in the £11.1bn acquisition of Alliance Boots in 2007. That was the same year it joined forces with rival TPG to acquire the US energy company TXU for the still-unsurpassed $45bn price tag.The two deals had sharply different outcomes. TXU fell into bankruptcy in 2014, virtually wiping out nearly $8bn of equity and tarnishing the idea of “club deals” in which private equity firms team up to tackle enormous acquisitions together. The Boots transaction was Britain’s largest management buyout. KKR merged the European chain with Walgreens of the US in a two-part deal, creating the company that Mr Pessina now leads.
3;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2019-11-05T20:14:05Z;Walgreens Boots Alliance explores $70bn buyout;Long-shot deal for pharmacy behemoth would be the largest private equity takeover ever;Walgreens Boots Alliance, the US-listed global drugstore group, has been exploring the possibility of a $70bn take-private deal, holding talks with a handful of private equity groups about what would be the largest buyout in history, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.The discussions follow more than a decade of aggressive dealmaking by Italian billionaire Stefano Pessina, who owns 16 per cent of Walgreens shares and who has assembled a retail and drug wholesaling business that now spans 25 countries. The group includes more than 18,750 stores in 11 countries and has annual revenues of almost $137bn.One of the people with knowledge of the discussions warned that a take-private was a long shot that would face a number of challenges — not least the size of the transaction. The current record buyout, of energy company TXU in 2007, was valued at $45bn.No final decision has been made about whether to pursue the buyout idea, the person added, and it was not clear whether financing on such a scale would be available. Walgreens declined to comment.Walgreens shares rose 4 per cent in afternoon trading in New York after Reuters and Bloomberg reported news of a possible take-private on Tuesday. That gave the company’s equity a market value of $55bn. It also has net debt of about $15bn.The talks come with Walgreens’ share price down nearly 40 per cent since last December. Mr Pessina has expressed his preference to turn companies round away from the glare of public markets.Walgreens has been under pressure to cut costs as its operating income fell by a fifth in the past year. The Illinois-based group has a huge footprint in physical retail, operating the Walgreens and Duane Reade brand stores in the US and the Boots chain of pharmacies in the UK.Boots has suffered after the UK’s National Health Service cut the amount it reimburses for prescriptions, when its retail business was already under pressure from cheaper rivals including supermarkets, discount stores and Superdrug, the chain backed by Li Ka-shing’s AS Watson retail group.A transaction would mark an audacious return to form for Mr Pessina, a restless dealmaker whose efforts to create a global pharmacy empire began with the formation of Alliance Santé in 1991 and created one of the world’s largest buyers of prescription drugs.Mr Pessina’s vision for a pan-European medicine chain met opposition in several countries, but the 1997 acquisition of Unichem provided Mr Pessina with a foothold in the UK, followed in 2006 by a merger with market leading pharmacy chain Boots.He teamed up with US buyout group KKR to take the combined business private in 2007 in a leveraged buyout funded by £9bn of debt. By the time Walgreens paid $23bn for its British rival in a two-part deal that completed in 2014, Mr Pessina had created a transatlantic behemoth, which today employs 440,000 people.The group also owns Alliance Healthcare, a wholesale distributor, delivering to hundreds of thousands of pharmacies, doctors and hospitals, and a stake in AmerisourceBergen, the US drug wholesaler. Shares in AmerisourceBergen fell 4 per cent after the first reports of a deal.As part of a large cost-cutting programme, Walgreens has been closing unprofitable locations, including 200 Walgreens stores, 150 in-store clinics and 200 Boots stores, and laying off employees. The aim is to save $1.8bn a year by 2022. It expects adjusted earnings per share to be flat next year on a constant currency basis.This article has been amended to reflect that Walgreens Boots Alliance has annual revenues of almost $137bn
4;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2019-10-28T14:03:33Z;Walgreens to step up cost savings as income falls;UK Boots chain suffers 2.7% fall in same-store retail sales;Walgreens Boots Alliance has revealed it will raise its annual cost savings target to at least $1.8bn by 2022, from $1.5bn, after a difficult year in which operating income fell by a fifth.The Illinois-based group, managed by billionaire Stefano Pessina and his partner Ornella Barra, has already increased the target once this year after challenging conditions in its two main markets resulted in a profit warning.Fourth-quarter and full-year results were broadly in line with these revised expectations. A 55 per cent fall in fourth-quarter earnings to $677m was caused partly by one-off charges relating to the cost-cutting programme.At the UK pharmacy chain Boots, a 2.7 per cent fall in same-store retail sales was compounded by a 1 per cent drop in pharmacy revenue.UK pharmacies, usually a defensive business, have been hit by lower volumes and changes to the system under which the country’s state-run health service reimburses them. Volumes have also come under pressure.Boots has cut jobs at its Nottingham head office and is reviewing up to 200 stores, but has also pledged to invest heavily as it fends off competition from both discounters and traditional rivals such as Superdrug, owned by Li Ka-shing’s A S Watson group.The division was largely responsible for a 1.8 per cent decline in fourth-quarter sales, adjusting for currency movements, at Walgreens’ international retail pharmacy business.Mr Pessina, who is executive chairman, said he was “encouraged” by the improvement in US sales performance in the second half of the fiscal year and forecast “roughly flat” growth in adjusted earnings per share in 2020 “with a range of plus or minus 3 per cent”.This would mark the second year of relatively moribund profit growth. Analysts had been forecasting growth of about 2.2 per cent in adjusted net income.In the US, where the company operates under the Walgreens and Duane Reade brands, same-store sales grew 3.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, driven by higher pharmacy sales.The wholesale pharmacy division saw sales rise 7.9 per cent in the final quarter.Walgreens shares have fallen by about a quarter during the past year.
5;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2019-09-01T04:00:28Z;Boots prepares for makeover as challenges mount;Walgreens-owned retailer seeks to revamp beauty business in face of tough competition ;"The last time Boots was owned by Americans it benefited from something of a renaissance. But Rexall Corp, which owned the British health and beauty chain as demand for beauty products exploded in the 1920s, had it easy compared with Stefano Pessina, the boss of its current US parent.Boots is possibly the most ubiquitous retailer in the UK; its store estate of more than 2,500 rivals the country’s biggest supermarket groups, Tesco and J Sainsbury. The brutal conditions on high streets mean it is facing one of the most challenging periods in its 170-year history.Pricing pressure in its pharmacy business — as the NHS, Britain’s state-run healthcare system, has cut the amount it reimburses for prescriptions — and competition in its beauty offering pushed operating profit at the retailer to a near-decade low of £391m last year. Boots has revealed plans to close up to 200 shops and shed 350 roles at the 280-acre campus in Nottingham it acquired in 1927.Seb James, the former Dixons Carphone boss hired by Mr Pessina in 2018, described the business as “a strange beast.” “It has this retail business and this pharmacy business — and we either will or won’t succeed in creating a symbiosis between those things that’s long-term sustainable,” he told the Financial Times.Boots has been shaped by a decade of dealmaking, which started in 2006, with the merger of the company and Mr Pessina’s Alliance UniChem pharmacy chain. Barely a year later, Mr Pessina took the group private in Europe’s largest leveraged buyout, a £12bn deal backed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The private equity house ceased to be a shareholder in 2016, following the two-stage sale of Alliance Boots to Walgreens. Mr James said the defensive characteristics of its pharmacies — many of which were acquired as part of the Alliance UniChem merger and generally dispense 1,500-2,000 prescriptions each week, had shielded Boots from some of the distress on UK high streets. “There hasn’t been any pressure [to shut stores].”But he acknowledged the retailer had fallen behind by relying on its own products plus a handful of brands, as the world of beauty rapidly moved on. “The way in which women shop beauty has changed fundamentally,” he said. “This was brought home to me pretty sharply when I went to Sephora on the Champs Elysée. I was two-thirds of the way through the store before I found a brand that we actually stocked.”Boots’ beauty business has been under attack from traditional rivals — supermarkets, discount stores and direct competitors such as Superdrug, which is backed by Li Ka-shing’s AS Watson retail business. Online upstarts including Feelunique, Lookfantastic and Beauty Pie have also targeted the sector. Boots’ market share in UK health and beauty has fallen five percentage points over the past decade, according to GlobalData.“Superdrug has been a really interesting turnround and a key reason why [Boots] lost share in beauty,” said Nelson Blackley, a senior research associate at Nottingham Trent University. “It targeted younger people with low-priced cosmetics through social media and influencer marketing.”Boots’ ecommerce offering is hardly cutting edge, while its pricing has been criticised as uncompetitive. “I don’t want Boots to close any stores because wherever we’re located next to them we do brilliantly, because we’re much better value,” quipped Poundland managing director Barry Williams recently. Mr James denied Boots had lost its edge on pricing, and said Boots.com had more market share than all pure-play beauty websites combined.It is the retailer’s sprawling physical estate that requires the most urgent attention. “You had deodorants next to luxury goods, so we sorted all that out,” said Mr James.Sephora and Nasdaq-listed Ulta are among the inspirations for the company’s upgraded beauty halls, which feature a wider choice of third-party brands. The most high profile recruit has been pop star Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty.“Rihanna has been great,” said Mr James. “Where Fenty is sold, it is often our number one cosmetics brand in those stores.” So far, though, Fenty is only on sale at 28 of almost 80 flagship stores.Challenges lie in wait elsewhere in Boots’ estate. It has more than 1,000 small pharmacies and several hundred midsized stores, many in struggling high streets or shopping centres. “There will be a lot of focus on flagships but [it is] just as important to find a format that works on high streets,” said Kien Tan, strategy director at PwC.Mr James wants to mimic the no-expense-spared revamp of its Covent Garden store at a lower cost. “There is a lot we can do just in terms of sharpening things up,” he said. “But we have got to be realistic. We have a big estate.”He did not expect to further shrink Boots’ portfolio beyond the 200 closures already outlined. “After that, all our stores will be contributing so we don’t envisage a lot more stores closing,” he said, adding that lease breaks could offer the chance to renegotiate rents.Questions have been asked about whether Walgreens will fund the necessary investment in stores given it is cutting costs. “Even a lick of paint across 2,500 stores does not come cheap,” pointed out Mr Blackley. Mr James said “a lot of the heavy lifting” on costs will be done at Walgreens, whose revenue is ten times more than Boots.Shares in Walgreens Boots Alliance, where Mr Pessina is chief executive, have fallen by a quarter in the past year.Elizabeth Fagan, Mr James’s predecessor as managing director and now chairman of Boots, said the company would step up the pace of change and defended Mr Pessina against suggestions that he was an absentee landlord, more interested in the next deal than operational detail.“I would say that the best thing that ever happened to Boots was Stefano Pessina coming in and investing in the business” she said. “They had given up on local pharmacy. The Alliance deal put Boots back into the community.”Since folding Alliance Boots into Walgreens, Mr Pessina has introduced some of Boots’ brands, particularly No 7 skincare, into Walgreens and sold Boots’ contract manufacturing business to Fareva, the French pharmaceutical company. Ornella Barra, Mr Pessina’s partner and Walgreens co-chief operating officer, said the company “very much believes in the Boots brand . . . and we continue to invest in it”."
6;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2019-06-27T12:16:00Z;Walgreens Boots sticks with guidance as US pharma sales improve;Steady outlook comes after the group’s previous quarter was its ‘most difficult’;Signs of improving pharmaceutical sales in the US during the third quarter and the continuation of its cost-cutting drive have given Walgreens Boots Alliance enough confidence to stick with its full-year earnings guidance.The retention of the steady outlook came as the company backed up from its “most difficult quarter” and reported sales and adjusted earnings in the three months to May 31 that squeaked in ahead of Wall Street forecasts, which helped push shares more than 1 per cent higher in premarket trade on Thursday.Stefano Pessina, chief executive, said he was “pleased to report an improvement in our US comparable growth compared with the first half of the year”, adding the company would “continue our aggressive response to rapidly shifting trends, and have already seen improved US retail sales and prescription growth” and was making good progress with its cost-cutting programme.The company, which operates Walgreens, Duane Reade in the US and Boots in the UK, stuck with its full-year guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be “roughly flat” compared to the $6.02 it reported in 2018. In April, WBA slashed its earnings guidance, having previously expected growth of between 7 per cent and 12 per cent.For the three months ended May 31, WBA reported a 0.7 per cent increase in net sales to $34.6bn, compared with a year earlier. That came in $135m higher than the median forecast among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.In particular, WBA pointed to a 2.3 per cent year-on-year rise in sales at its main Retail Pharmacy USA division, with a rise in pharmacy sales offsetting declining retail sales. Excluding the impact of optimising stores following its purchase of more than 1,600 Rite Aid stores last year, organic sales, which strip out acquisitions and divestitures, rose 2.9 per cent from a year ago.Sales at WBA’s Retail Pharmacy International unit fell 7.3 per cent from a year ago, largely due to a stronger dollar. The company’s Pharmaceutical Wholesale unit saw sales fall 1.7 per cent in the third quarter compared to a year earlier due to the strong dollar, but were actually up 8.3 per cent when exchange rate fluctuations were taken into account.All of that filtered down to reported earnings in the third quarter of $1.13 a share. That was 16.5 per cent higher than a year ago, but seven cents short of analysts’ estimates. Adjusted earnings were down 4 per cent from a year ago to $1.47 a share, but this topped Wall Street forecasts by four cents.WBA shares were 1 per cent higher in pre-market trade, but remain about 23 per cent lower for 2019.
7;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2019-06-26T16:22:50Z;Boots steps up store investment to lift sales;Retailer says any closures will be focused on reducing duplication with pharmacies in line of fire;Boots is ramping up spending on stores and experimenting with new formats as it looks to lift sales and take back market share.The 170-year-old chain, which has more than 2,000 stores in the UK, has been losing market share to supermarkets and discounters in recent years, while its US owner Walgreens took large dividends out of the company rather than investing.It has already said it is reviewing some stores, thought to be about 200. On Wednesday managing director Sebastian James said the focus would be on rejuvenating stores, suggesting that the smaller pharmacy-based outlets would bear the brunt of any closures.“Retail store numbers are not far off what we think we need,” he said as he unveiled a new look store in London’s Covent Garden. “But we need to do some rationalisation [in pharmacy]. There are high streets with three or four branches of Boots on them. It’s about reducing duplication, not coverage.”Weaker trading has injected additional urgency to Boots’ investment plans. Same-store sales fell 2.5 per cent in the first half of its financial year, while profit was down 16 per cent. “It’s quite tough out there. There are some storm clouds gathering,” said Mr James of current trading.Boots’ sprawling store estate is partly a product of its 2006 merger with Alliance Unichem. In the past, it has been reluctant to close pharmacies because their licences — a valuable commodity — would frequently end up in the hands of competitors.Mr James, who ran Dixons Carphone before taking over at Boots last year, said the fate of community pharmacies partly rested on the direction the National Health Service took. “We could end up with more if the NHS decides community pharmacies have a major role to play,” he added.Mr James acknowledged that Boots had been “unclear about the dividing line” between community pharmacy and retail in the past and had allowed stores to become “tired”.“Most of the competition have had three or four years of working on store revamps. Now it’s our turn,” he added.The Covent Garden store, which opens on Thursday, features Amazon-style lockers for prescription collections along with extra staff to offer advice. Elsewhere, the company has refurbished 24 beauty halls at bigger stores and introduced new brands such as Urban Decay and Fenty Beauty, created by pop star Rihanna.Boots’ main competitors on the UK’s high streets are Superdrug, owned by Li Ka-shing’s AS Watson group, and US-owned LloydsPharmacy. But it faces threats from elsewhere too. “Boots has been losing market share for about 10 years,” said Patrick O’Brien at GlobalData. “For the first five years, it was the supermarkets but now it’s about the discounters.”Since 2007, the share of the UK’s health and beauty market held by discounters has more than doubled to 10 per cent, Mr O’Brien added.Walgreens has faced challenges in its domestic market too, and some have questioned whether Stefano Pessina, the veteran dealmaker who built up the Walgreens empire, is committed to the level of investment that may be required. To which Mr James retorted: “He’s never said no to me yet.”
8;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2019-05-28T20:33:58Z;More than 200 Boots stores at risk amid cost-cutting drive;Group reviewing underperforming outlets and being ‘realistic’ about the future;"Boots, the pharmacy chain owned by US giant Walgreens Boots Alliance, is reported to be reviewing more than 200 of its UK stores as part of a plan to cut costs and reinvigorate profit growth.With pharmacy revenues under pressure in both the UK and US, Walgreens said in April that it had taken “decisive action” to reduce UK head office costs and initiated a store portfolio review.The declining competitiveness of its stores has for a while been masked by the huge procurement cost savings generated by Boots’ initial merger with Alliance UniChem and then its combination with Illinois-based Walgreens, which was fully completed in 2014, analysts say.“We currently do not have a major programme envisaged, but as you’d expect we always review underperforming stores and seek out opportunities for consolidation,” a spokesman for the company said. More than 200 of its 2,485 UK stores were being reviewed for closure, Sky News reported.“We are being realistic about the future and that we will need to be agile to adapt to the changing landscape,” the spokesman added.Boots, founded in Nottingham in 1849, has traditionally been one of the most trusted brands on the UK’s high streets, especially among women, but other retailers have copied traditional footfall drivers such as lunchtime “meal deals”, while the beauty sector has begun to migrate online.In addition to formidable competition from Superdrug, owned by Hong Kong based AS Watson, discounters and supermarkets have cut prices on personal goods like shampoo to lure customers into their own stores.“There has been a gradual hollowing out of the company over the past few years,” said one analyst.More recently, changes to the procedures under which the UK’s state-run health service reimburses pharmacies’ drug costs have also hit hurt profits. In 2018, rival Lloyds Pharmacies closed 190 outlets, citing the cutbacks as a factor.In response to the sector’s changing dynamics, Walgreens appointed former Dixons Carphone boss Seb James as chief executive in late 2018. His plans include improving the customer experience in larger stores and offering more brands; last month, Boots began selling the Fenty Beauty range created by pop star Rihanna and plans to open a dedicated beauty store in London’s Covent Garden.However, the company still has great defensive strengths. Its Advantage loyalty card is carried by over 17 million Britons while some of its own brands, such as tanning lotion range Soltan, are market leaders in their sector."
9;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world.

10;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2019-04-23T23:32:35Z;US pharmacy chains increase minimum age for tobacco sales to 21;Walgreens and Rite Aid respond to pressure from regulator over youth tobacco use;Walgreens, the US pharmacy and retail chain, will ban customers under 21 from purchasing cigarettes and e-cigarettes, as it responds to pressure from a US regulator cracking down on youth tobacco use.In February, the US Food and Drug Administration accused Walgreens of being the “top violator among pharmacies that sell tobacco products”, with 22 per cent of stores inspected having illegally sold tobacco products to minors.The regulator initiated enforcement action against some Walgreens outlets and against rival Circle K Stores, warning the retailers that it would vigorously enforce the law. The FDA banned a Walgreens store in Miami, Florida, from selling tobacco for 30 days.Rite Aid, a Walgreens competitor, also said on Tuesday that it would increase the age to purchase tobacco products to 21, “consistent with the company’s commitment to promoting responsible access to tobacco products”. Rite Aid had already announced that it will remove e-cigarettes and vaping products chain-wide. The changes will go into effect across all Rite Aid stores within 90 days, it said.Momentum has been building behind local and federal political efforts to curb tobacco sales. Some 12 US states have raised the minimum age to 21, and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell introduced a bill last week to raise the minimum smoking age countrywide to 21, because of a spike in the number of teenagers vaping.Most US states set the minimum age at 18.Walgreens said it would raise its age minimum nationwide from the start of September.Richard Ashworth, the company’s president of operations, said other efforts to reduce tobacco use among teens and young adults, such as requiring age verification for all purchases and training pharmacists in smoking cessation advice, had seen “positive results”. Banning tobacco sales to under-21s would be “even more impactful”, he added.Shares in Walgreens were down a little over 1 per cent in midday trading in New York, while the wider S&P 500 rose.In February, then FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said he planned to meet Walgreens executives to discuss whether there was a “corporate-wide issue” and said he was “deeply disturbed” that the chain racked up almost 1,800 violations of tobacco regulations.“Retailers in particular — especially those who position themselves as health-and-wellness-minded businesses — are on the front lines of these efforts and must take that legal obligation seriously,” Dr Gottlieb said in a statement at the time.“I have particular concerns about whether the pharmacy setting is influencing consumer and retailer perceptions around tobacco products in a way that’s contributing to these troubling findings.”The FDA stepped up its effort to reduce youth tobacco use in response to the popularity of e-cigarettes, which often appeal to teenagers because of their flavours and can act as a gateway to other tobacco products. The regulator proposed banning flavoured tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes.Ned Sharpless, the new interim FDA commissioner, is expected to continue the crackdown. He was most recently the director of the National Cancer Institute.
11;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Walgreens Boots slashes outlook after ‘most difficult quarter’;Drugstore and chemist group warns on tough industry conditions and continued UK weakness;Walgreens Boots Alliance has slashed its full-year earnings outlook after warning that weak retail sales in both the US and UK had led to the transatlantic pharmacy chain’s “most difficult quarter” since its merger five years ago.Shares in the company, which operates Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in the US and Boots in the UK, fell more than 13 per cent in early trading after it forecast that 2019 profits would be flat rather than increasing 7 to 12 per cent.Like other US drugstore chains, Walgreens’ margins are being hit by pressure to cut prescription drug prices as well as cheaper generic drugs. While prescription sales in its US stores rose 9.8 per cent in the second quarter, gross profit fell 3.2 per cent.Stefano Pessina, chief executive, blamed “consumer market challenges in the US and UK” on the profit warning, admitting the company’s “response was not rapid enough”. Walgreens has added an extra $500m to its $1bn cost-cutting programme. It is already cutting costs in the UK, including announcing in February that it would cut about 20 per cent of its headcount at its Nottingham headquarters, and reviewing its store portfolio to see which might need to be closed.Ross Muken, an analyst at Evercore, said drug price inflation had slowed, especially in the drugs sold at pharmacies.Sales of general products such as toothbrushes and make-up are also under pressure from online rivals such as Amazon. Like-for-like retail sales at its US stores fell 3.8 per cent during the quarter.Meanwhile, Walgreens said its UK business remained “challenging”. Its international business — mainly its British Boots pharmacy chain — saw sales drop 7.1 per cent year-on-year to $3.1bn as weak revenues were further knocked by the slide in the pound.Margins for drugs are also under pressure in the UK, where the National Health Service has been cutting how much it reimburses pharmacies, Mr Muken said. Same store pharmacy sales in the UK fell 1.5 per cent because of lower revenues from hospitals and decreased revenue-per-item.Overall sales rose 4.5 per cent to $34.5bn in the three months to end of February, largely because of the addition of 1,651 Rite Aid stores it bought last year. Net income was 14 per cent lower at $1.1bn. Stripping out one-off charges related to the previous year’s tax gains and restructuring, adjusted earnings were $1.64 per share, below the $1.72 a share the market had expected.Shares in Walgreens were 13 per cent lower at $55.50. Rival CVS was also knocked lower and was trading down 3.3 per cent. Analysts at Credit Suisse, who reduced their target price from $79 to $70, said they believe the shares may sink further.
12;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2019-03-13T12:18:28Z;Investors cheer as Rite Aid replaces CEO;;Investors are cheering the news that Rite Aid’s chief executive will depart following a nine-year stint and two failed merger attempts that left the stock languishing at less than $1.Shares in the drugstore chain jumped nearly 18 per cent in pre-market trading on Wednesday, after the company last night said John Standley will step down as CEO. Also leaving the company are chief financial officer Darren Karst and chief operating officer Kermit Crawford.The leadership changes come just months after Rite Aid shareholders rejected a big pay increase for Mr Standley at the company’s annual general meeting and follows a period of growing investor unrest over the direction of the US pharmacy chain.“The Board believes that now is the right time to undertake a leadership transition,” said Bruce Bodaken, Rite Aid’s chairman. “We will be focused on recruiting a leader that will best position Rite Aid to create long-term value for shareholders.”Rite Aid has been hit by a series of setbacks in recent years. Walgreens Boots Alliance had originally sought to buy its smaller rival for $17.2bn, including debt, in October 2015. However, the companies were forced to scrap the deal 20 months later after antitrust regulators expressed concerns about combining two of the country’s largest pharmacy chains.Instead, Rite Aid agreed to a revised deal to sell 1,932 stores and three distribution centres to Walgreens for $4.38bn.Last Febuary, it agreed to sell its remaining 2,500 stores to US supermarket group Albertsons in a cash and stock deal that would have left Rite Aid shareholders with ownership of between 28 per cent and 29.6 per cent of the combined company.But this merger attempt also fell through after shareholders opposed the terms.The deal’s collapse left Rite Aid facing renewed questions over its future as a standalone company, since it lacks the scale of larger rivals CVS and Walgreens.In its last earnings results released in December, the pharmacy chain said it would record an adjusted net loss of between $14m and $33m for the 12 months to start of March. Total revenues are expected to be between $21.8bn and $21.95bn for the year, with same-store sales growth forecast to be in the range of 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent over the prior year.Alongside the management changes, Rite Aid also announced plans to get rid of 400 corporate positions as part of a wider restructuring aimed at cutting costs.Mr Standley, who joined Rite Aid in 2008 and took the helm in 2010, was stripped of the chairman title last September as part of a push to increase independent oversight at the company. Rite Aid said Mr Standley will stay on as CEO until the appointment of his successor.Shares in Rite Aid, which had been worth nearly $9 a share at the start of 2017, closed at 68 cents on Tuesday.
13;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2018-12-20T14:25:02Z;Pharmacy chain Walgreens flags up ‘challenging market conditions’;US-based group also unveils $1bn cost-cutting programme;Walgreens Boots Alliance on Thursday unveiled a $1bn cost cutting programme as its chief executive warned of “challenging market conditions” in some of the areas where the pharmacy chain does business.The group said it will target annual savings of more than $1bn by the end of the three-year cost-cutting scheme. “The programme includes divisional optimisation initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organisation and digitalisation of the enterprise to transform long-term capabilities,” the company said.Walgreens, which operates Duane Reade and its namesake stores in the US and Boots in the UK, said it expects these initiatives to result in “significant restructuring and other special charges as they are implemented” and recorded pre-tax charges of $30m in three months ended in November.The cost-cutting plan targets its pharmaceutical wholesale division, retail business in China and Mexico and its US retail pharmacy division.“Our business [is] used to working in challenging market conditions, but in some of our markets, we have experienced the most difficult trading environment that I can remember,” chief executive Stefano Pessina’said on the company’s earnings call.The remarks came as Walgreens reported a 9.9 per cent year-on-year increase to $33.79bn in sales for the quarter ended on November 30, aided by its 2017 decision to buy nearly half of rival Rite Aid’s stores. That was in line with analysts' estimates of $33.78bn, according to a survey by Refinitiv.In the US, pharmacy sales climbed 17.5 per cent from a year ago, driven by higher prescription volumes following the acquisition of Rite Aid stores, while comparable pharmacy sales rose 2.8 per cent.Retail sales rose 6 per cent though comparable retail sales were down 3.2 per cent as the company moved away from tobacco and faced tough comparisons in the year ago quarter, when sales were boosted by hurricanes and a severe flu season.Its international retail pharmacy division saw a 5.9 per cent decline in sales. In the UK, like-for-like pharmacy sales declined 3.5 per cent, while comparable retail sales fell 2.6 per cent. “Improved Boots UK market share performance was more than offset by a very weak retail environment,” the company said.Net income rose to $1.1bn or $1.18 a share, up from $821m or 81 cents a share in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.46 a share, exceeded analyst projections by three cents.Looking ahead, Walgreens continues to expect adjusted earnings per share growth of between 7 to 12 per cent in fiscal 2019, at constant currency rates.Walgreens shares, which are up nearly 1 per cent year-to-date, were down roughly 2 per cent in pre-market trade.
14;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2018-06-29T17:10:17Z;Amazon’s unparalleled power over markets;When the US internet retailer sneezes, entire industries catch cold;By spending $1bn, Amazon made $14bn disappear. The money that went missing was not Amazon’s, though. That sum was the loss in market value at the biggest players in US drug distribution and retailing, after Amazon announced on Thursday that it would spend that billion to buy online pharmacist PillPack. Shares in those six companies (Walgreens, Boots Alliance, CVS Health, Express Scripts, Cardinal Health, McKesson, and AmerisourceBergen) had been depressed last year by the very suggestion that Amazon was coming into their territory. Proof positive trimmed their values by as much as 10 per cent.It is hard to think of any other company in the modern era that could have that kind of impact on a market that it is not even in yet, just by the industrial equivalent of clearing its throat — not even IBM, General Electric, or Microsoft in their heydays.And yet the market is not overreacting. Amazon’s success in colonising other branches of retail, and even some big non-retail businesses, justifies the wariness. What is more, there are good reasons for everyone to be grateful that Amazon has such tremendous power.The business of getting pharmaceuticals to consumers is complicated, capitally intensive, and surrounded by regulatory barriers to entry. As a result, the big companies that dominate it — distributors, pharmacy benefit managers, and retail pharmacies — face limited competition and have opportunities to extract economic rent. This is exactly the kind of situation where Amazon thrives: investing prodigiously, pricing aggressively, and offering customers better service. Where Amazon goes, margins compress and stock prices fall. The corollary to that is that consumers pay less — and not just at Amazon itself. In 2015, Walmart, by far the biggest retailer in America, was forced to concede that in the era of Amazon its old margin structure was simply impossible to maintain. It would have to cut prices, improve service at its stores, and produce lower profits. It was forced, in other words, to do better by its customers.The main reason that Amazon can have this impact is that its investors do not expect it to make much profit. Concluding (with some reason) that Amazon is the company of the future, shareholders bid up the stock despite razor-thin margins. This is what allows Amazon to invest so heavily in both intellectual property and hard assets — it spent $34bn on technology, content, and capital expenditures last year.So: Amazon competes hard and invests heavily, just the things that make capitalism work as it should. Worries that Amazon is a threat to competition — and many people do worry about this — may therefore seem quixotic. The concern is that when the Amazon steamroller has flattened the industrial landscape, it will be free to raise prices and, more importantly, either crush or buy out any innovative rival to its established franchises.To waive this away on the grounds that one day a new competitor will unseat Amazon, just as Amazon unseated Walmart, seems naive. Amazon has not only a huge edge in physical infrastructure, as Walmart once did. It also enjoys technological network effects to rival Microsoft’s and a trove of consumer data that would make Mark Zuckerberg blush.For now, most of us reap the benefits of Amazon’s unprecedented market muscle. But there may come a moment when the balance shifts, and Amazon’s size and power do more harm than good. The really scary possibility is that, after years as happy customers, we may not even recognise that moment when it arrives.I want to keep real shops, particularly bookshops / From Antony Black, Dundee, UK
15;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Amazon kick-starts campaign to disrupt pharmacy sector;PillPack deal offers the US group a launch pad for a hallmark full-frontal assault;In 1940, the late Karl Hanke took a job as a delivery boy at the Corner Drug store, an independent pharmacy in Woodland, California, fetching medicines to patients on his bike. He eventually joined the military and trained as a pharmacist before taking over the business.“At one point we also had a liquor licence, so we delivered alcohol alongside prescription drugs,” recalled his daughter Lisa Shelley, who bought the store from her father in 1999.These days, retailers deliver everything from clothes and groceries to flat screen televisions to consumers who order them online, in a shift that is battering traditional companies used to selling their wares in physical stores.But something strange is happening in the US healthcare industry: the trend has gone in the opposite direction. Last year, about 88 per cent of prescriptions were collected at bricks-and-mortar pharmacies, compared with 82 per cent in 2009, according to Goldman Sachs.Amazon is hoping to change that with its first major foray into the $560bn market for prescription drugs in the US. It is paying roughly $1bn to acquire PillPack, a mail-order pharmacy that packages tablets into daily portions before delivering them by post.9.9%Fall in Walgreens Boots Alliance share price on day of Amazon-PillPack dealThe deal follows the appointment earlier this month of Atul Gawande as chief executive of the independent healthcare company funded jointly by Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase for their employees. The non-profit venture aims to cut health bills for their employees and “potentially all Americans”.PillPack specialises in serving patients who suffer from one or more chronic illness and, therefore, take a lot of medication every day. Although this group is small in number, it represents a lucrative part of the healthcare industry. Express Scripts, a large pharmacy benefits manager, says “super spenders” who spend $50,000 or more on medicines every year account for roughly 20 per cent of overall drug costs.Still, few observers think Amazon will limit its ambitions to this corner of the market. Instead, they see its acquisition of PillPack as a chance to gain a toehold it can use to launch the kind of full-frontal assault that has become its hallmark.Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings Solutions, which makes software to help people reduce their drug bills, says buying PillPack will allow Amazon to move more quickly than if it had launched its own pharmacy from scratch.“This is a play for speed — it takes a lot of time and work to get a pharmacy started, and to get all the proper licensing,” said Mr Rea, a former pharmacist.Eric Kinariwala, chief executive of Capsule, a pharmacy start-up, agreed. “They’re buying regulatory permits and contracts with health insurers, and that accelerates their market entry.”If Amazon hopes to apply its formula for digital disruption to the pharmacy industry, it will first have to work out why the proportion of people fulfilling their prescriptions at drugstores is on the rise even as other trips to physical shops are falling.It is certainly not because drugstore chains are nice places to spend time in. Many of them are dingy, suffering from years of under-investment with long queues caused by understaffing.One reason is that existing mail-order pharmacies are just not very convenient. Express Scripts, one of the largest operators, takes eight days to deliver after receiving an order, and up to two weeks for new prescriptions.The process of getting a prescription fulfilled in the US has also become more complex in recent years, as health insurers introduce measures designed to control soaring drug prices.Many patients turn up to the pharmacy counter only to discover that the medicine they have been prescribed is not covered by their policy, or that they must make an unaffordable personal “out of pocket” contribution.[Pharmacies] are reinventing themselves by refocusing the real estate around population health and trying to become this stickier one-stop shopMore often than not, the drugstore will then ring the doctor’s surgery to find out if they can prescribe a cheaper alternative. About 30 per cent of prescriptions result in a “pharmacy callback”, leading to more than 900m calls a year, according to a report from the US Department of Health and Human Services.Although the back-and-forth process is often torturous, patients who attend a drugstore in person can at least try to make sure that they leave with their medication in hand.If Amazon wants to expand the market for mail-order prescription drugs, it will have to solve these problems, said Mr Kinariwala.His company is trying to tackle the “pain points” with software that allows the doctor and pharmacist to communicate more effectively. And the start-up has a team of couriers who deliver medicines to patients within two hours of receiving the prescription.If Amazon can make the process of ordering drugs online quicker and less cumbersome, the biggest losers will be the large drugstore chains. Shares in CVS Health, the largest operator, had shed 6.1 per cent by the close of trading on Thursday, when Amazon announced the PillPack deal. Walgreens Boots Alliance’s stock price fell 9.9 per cent.“Amazon is already eroding their retail business and this is definitely another threat,” says Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink.The large chains have responded with plans to turn their stores into health clinics, where patients can see a doctor or nurse before getting their prescription. This month, Walgreens announced a partnership with Humana, a health insurer, to launch clinics for senior citizens. And CVS Health has said its $69bn acquisition of Aetna, another insurer, presages a push to turn its stores into “ healthcare hubs”.“They are reinventing themselves by refocusing the real estate around population health and trying to become this stickier one-stop shop,” said Ms Gupte.Not everyone is convinced the strategy will work. “Who wants to see their doctor in a drugstore chain?” said Mr Kinariwala. “It’s an awful, uninviting setting.”If Amazon succeeds in disrupting the pharmacy market, then more patients could soon get their medication delivered to their door — just as Corner Drug’s customers have been for all these years. Today the bicycles have been replaced by a pair of small city cars and the drugs arrive without the booze. “We sold the liquor licence in the 1980s,” said Ms Shelley. “It was worth quite a lot.”
16;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Debutante fall — Walgreens and GE diverge after Dow shake-up;;Like a cool guy walking away from an explosion without looking back, General Electric shares have rocketed higher since its exit this week from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Caught at the centre of the blast was its replacement, Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was thumped on Thursday after Amazon made moves that could shake-up drugstore retailers around the US.Walgreens has done little to help out in the three sessions since joining Team Dow.Its 1 per cent drop on Tuesday was the worst first-day performance for a debutante since Intel was added to the gauge in November 1999, and its underperformance versus the Dow, of 1.1 per cent, was the worst since JPMorgan joined in May 1991.Even Walgreens’ announcement on Thursday morning of better than expected quarterly earnings and a $10bn share buyback did little to shield it from the potential future impact on the US drugstore industry from Amazon’s decision today to purchase PillPack, a delivery-focused pharmacy.Walgreens shares were down 9.5 per cent at a nearly-four-year low following the news. Other pharmacy stocks were hurt as well, with CVS Health down 6.1 per cent and Express Scripts down 1.4 per cent.Since joining the Dow, Walgreens shares have fallen 11.2 per cent. GE on the other hand, has gained 8.5 per cent and the Dow has slipped 0.2 per cent over the same period.The industrial conglomerate, which was one of the original 12 members of the Dow when the Average was created in 1986, revealed on Tuesday it would slim its operations and spin off its healthcare assets and Baker Hughes. Investors cheered the decision and pushed shares 7.8 per cent higher on the day.So far this year, Walgreens shares are down 17.8 per cent, while GE is off 20.7 per cent. The Dow is 2 per cent lower in 2018.
17;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2018-06-28T17:24:00Z;Amazon: pill popper;Drug delivery is a low margin, high volume business that keeps getting squeezed;As Amazon made it its first pricey bet in the healthcare sector, it was fitting that a possible future victim of its disruptive efforts was rolling out a $10bn stock buyback and ramping up its dividend. The Seattle tech titan said on Thursday it was buying PillPack, a hot start-up online pharmacy perhaps valued at $1bn. Just as that news broke, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced its massive capital return.When asked about Amazon, Walgreen’s chief executive was naturally dismissive saying he was “not particularly worried” and that “pharmacy work was much more complex than just delivering certain pills or certain packages”. That observation was correct. But the massive drops in equity values across healthcare stocks confirmed a broader trend: rent-seeking in selling medicines is endangered.PillPack would dispute that it is just “delivering certain pills or certain packages.”. Beyond mailing medication, it assembles dosages to make life easier for customers taking complex treatments. News reports earlier this year had Walmart close to an acquisition.The shares of large pharmacy and drug wholesalers, such as CVS, Walgreens and McKesson, dropped between seven and 10 per cent. Investors are right to worry about Amazon’s ambitions. Its Prime subscription service boasts 100m subscribers.Drug delivery is a low margin, high volume business that keeps getting squeezed. Operating profit margins for the three legacy companies range between two and five per cent.But the relationships pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens have with customers are not easily replicated. Aetna, the massive health insurance company, recently sold itself to CVS for $77bn. This signalled the end of an era when insurance premiums rose 10 per cent or more annually. Regulators want healthcare spending to become more efficient. With an insurer and a pharmacy coming together, patients should be able to get better, cheaper healthcare coverage with all their data under one roof.Amazon has not bought an insurer just yet. But it is partnering with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway to experiment with new healthcare business models. Walgreens and others should be worried. For now though, their share buybacks just got cheaper.
18;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2018-06-28T11:52:07Z;Walgreens unveils $10bn buyback after earnings beat;Sales were boosted by 2017 deal for Rite Aid stores;Walgreens Boots Alliance unveiled a $10bn share buyback and raised its quarterly dividend by 10 per cent as it beat Wall Street expectations for quarterly earnings.The retail pharmacy chain operator, which replaced General Electric on the Dow Jones Industrial Average earlier this week, said earnings for its fiscal third quarter ending in May came in at $1.35bn, or $1.35 per diluted share. That’s up from the $1.08 a share recorded in the prior year period and well ahead of the $1.29 a share Wall Street had forecast.Net sales were up 14 per cent at $34.3bn, boosted by last year’s deal to buy nearly half of rival Rite Aid’s stores. Wall Street was expecting sales of $34.1bn. Comparable store sales at its all important US retail pharamcy division were down 1.2 per cent however as continued weakness at the front-end of its stores, where it sells over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics overshadowed growth in its prescription business.Still, underscoring its confidence, Walgreens, which operates Duane Reade and its eponymous chain of pharmacies in the US and Boots in the UK, raised the lower end of its guidance for the 2018 fiscal year. It now expects adjusted diluted net earnings of between $5.90 and $6.05 per share for the year.“I am pleased that, in what has been a challenging environment, we have again delivered solid earnings per share growth combined with healthy cash flow,” said chief executive Stefano Pessina.“We expect to continue to drive growth, bringing more patients to our US pharmacies through the recent acquisition of Rite Aid stores and through strategic partnerships. The $10 billion share repurchase program announced this morning demonstrates our confidence in future business performance and, as ever, our focus on driving long-term stockholder value.”Shares in Walgreens initially rose, but gave up those gains to trade 0.5 per cent lower in pre-market trading. They are down 9 per cent for the year to date.
19;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2018-06-19T22:56:34Z;General Electric booted from the Dow after more than a century;Industrial group, a founder member of the index in 1896, cedes its place to Walgreens;After more than a century on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, General Electric will be replaced in the index by pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance when trading begins on June 26.The decision has little practical impact, but is symbolic of the industrial group’s decline in recent years. GE was a constituent of the Dow when the index was created in 1896, and has been a member continuously since 1907.In the 1990s GE was the largest US company by market capitalisation and, as recently as 2009, was one of the five-largest listed groups in the world. It has been hit by a series of problems including downturns in the market for gas-fired power plants and oilfield services, and legacy liabilities from insurance operations it sold in 2006. Last year it was forced to cut its dividend, for the second time since 1938.David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the S&P Dow Jones Indices’ index committee, said in a statement that putting in Walgreens to replace GE would “make the index a better measure of the economy and the stock market” by giving greater weight to the consumer and healthcare sectors.The decision also reflects the idiosyncratic nature of the Dow, which has 30 constituents weighted by share price rather than by market capitalisation. After falling 54 per cent in the past 12 months, GE’s shares were $12.95 at the market close on Tuesday, and it has much less effect on the index than members with higher share prices such as Goldman Sachs at $228 and Apple at $186.At an equity valuation of about $113bn, GE still has a larger market capitalisation than other industrial companies that have been kept in the Dow, including United Technologies at $100bn and Caterpillar at $86bn.In the broader S&P 500 index, GE is ranked 44th by market capitalisation.GE shares dropped about 1.5 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday following the announcement. Walgreens got a lift, rising 4.4 per cent.That modest reaction reflects the fact that the Dow is little used by investment funds for tracking or benchmarking performance. About $29.6bn worth of assets tracks the Dow or is benchmarked against it, compared to $9.94tn that uses the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.GE said in a statement: “We are focused on executing against the plan we’ve laid out to improve GE’s performance. Today’s announcement does nothing to change those commitments or our focus in creating in a stronger, simpler GE.”

21;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;AmerisourceBergen, Walgreens fall after deal talks reportedly end;;Walgreens Boots Alliance and AmerisourceBergen shares dropped on Tuesday after a report said the two companies had wrapped up discussions about a possible acquisition without reaching a deal.Shares of Walgreens, the global drugstore group, were down 2.6 per cent to $68.73, while AmerisourceBerger, the pharmaceuticals distributor, shed 5.5 per cent to $95.01 on the heels of the report from CNBC.Earlier this month, Walgreens was said to be discussing a purchase of AmerisourceBergen, amid big shifts in the pharmacy and drug distribution industry in the US. Sources familiar with the discussions told the FT that the two companies had been talking for several weeks about a potential deal, which would combine the second-largest US drugstore chain with one of the country’s largest medicines distributors.CNBC said on Tuesday that the early-stage exploration had ended without an agreement, but that it was possible that talks could one day resume.Walgreens already owns 26 per cent of Amerisource.
22;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2018-02-20T18:36:04Z;Albertsons/Cerberus: dog in the fight;Even a mega food and drug retailer does not excite investors;In Greek mythology, Cerberus is the three-headed canine that keeps the dead from escaping the underworld. The acclaimed private equity investor of the same name has struggled to exit the hell that is the US grocery market. On Tuesday, it finally found a way out.Cerberus Capital Management first bought a piece of supermarket chain Albertsons in 2006. In the 12 years since, it has bought the rest of it and scooped up several other wobbling grocery outfits, including the national chain Safeway. But the travails of retail have scotched the listing plans it revealed in 2015. Now, it plans to merge Albertsons with the carcass of pharmacy Rite Aid, creating a food and drug beast with $85bn in annual revenues.Rite Aid is another opportunistic target. In 2015, the distant third-largest US pharmacy announced a sale to Walgreens Boots Alliance at $9 a share. But regulators quashed the transaction, so Rite Aid ended up selling a fraction of its locations to Walgreens instead. On Tuesday, Rite Aid shares traded at just over $2.Now Albertsons will combine with Rite Aid, with the latter’s shareholders owning around a third of the combined company. That proportion seems generous to Rite Aid given its operating profit is only just a fifth of the pro forma total. Rite Aid shares barely responded. Walmart reported a disappointing festive season on the same day, so perhaps the idea of even a huge food and drug chain does not seem so compelling.Other large drug chains have tried different paths. Walgreens is keen on the drug wholesaling business. CVS has one of the largest pharmacy benefits managers, which oversee insurance payments for drugs. Rite Aid has a small PBM unit as well.Overall, by buying cheaply and unlocking property values, Cerberus has probably done well on its grocery adventures. But, after more than a decade, its continued participation is hardly an endorsement of the sector’s prospects.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

23;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Dixons Carphone chief to leave for Walgreens Boots Alliance;Exit comes as company plans to overhaul smartphone selling amid weaker upgrade demand;The chief executive of Dixons Carphone – the UK smartphone retailer that warned last year about a slowdown in the mobile phone market – is ringing off.The company announced late Friday that Sebastian James will step down at the end of the financial year after six years in the top job. He will be joining Walgreens Boots Alliance later this year as senior vice-president and president and managing director of Boots, the pharmacy chain, the company said.Mr James’ replacement will be Alex Baldock, currently group chief executive at Shop Direct, which is billed as the UK’s second-largest pure-play online retailer, a job he has held since 2012.Dixons has been struggling to shore up sliding profits amid weaker demand for mobile upgrades. In December, it said it will overhaul the way it sells smartphones, revising down its full-year earnings estimates for the second time that year.Mr James said in a statement:“It has been an enormous privilege to lead this business and to work with such passionate and committed colleagues over the last few years. Together, I think that we can be very proud of the profound transformation that we have seen in Dixons Carphone and the sound footing, customer affection, and place in the world that it now enjoys. I offer my most sincere thanks to Ian (Livingston, Dixons Carphone chairman), the Board and my colleagues for their support and friendship over these years. I will be very sad to leave, tempered only by the fact that I know that Alex will do a terrific job of leading the company and driving it on to new heights.”
24;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2018-01-03T21:41:48Z;Declining sales leave Rite Aid shares woozy;;Shares of US drug-store chain Rite Aid dropped in after-hours trading on Wednesday after it reported a year-over-year decline in revenue thanks in part to lower pharmacy-services sales.The company — which this year was forced to call off a planned acquisition by rival chain Walgreens amid regulatory resistance — saw its shares drop nearly 5 per cent in after-hours trading after releasing results from the quarter ending December 2.Rite Aid said revenue from continuing operations was $5.4bn, compared to $5.7bn from the same period a year earlier and well below the $7.59bn in sales that analysts surveyed by Factset had been expecting. Net loss from continuing operations was $18.2m, or 2 cents per diluted share, versus a $23.6m profit, or 2 cents a share, from the year-ago period. Analysts had been expecting a steeper loss of $31m, or 4 cents a share.Same-store sales — a key industry metric — declined 2.5 per cent from a year earlier, in line with forecasts. Of that, its pharmacy sales dropped 3.5 per cent, while front-end, or non-prescription, sales were down just 0.5 per cent.Rite Aid is emerging from a rocky 2017, in which its shares fell 76 per cent just as its Walgreens deal was starting to hit the rocks. The deal, originally announced in 2015, was ultimately scrapped in favour, and Walgreens instead agree to purchase more than 2,000 Rite Aid stores for $5.2bn.Rite Aid chairman and chief executive John Standley said in a statement:“The third quarter was a busy time for our team in preparing for and beginning the transfer of stores and related assets to Walgreens Boots Alliance. I would like to thank our entire Rite Aid team for their dedication and efforts in accomplishing this important business initiative for our company and our shareholders. To date, we have transferred 357 stores and have received approximately $715 million in proceeds, which we have used to pay down debt. Looking forward, in addition to completing the transfer process, we will continue to focus on our most significant business-building opportunities as we work together to deliver a great experience to our customers and patients.”
25;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2017-12-06T12:53:05Z;Walgreens boosts China exposure with investment in GuoDa Drugstores;;Walgreens Boots Alliance, America’s biggest retail pharmacy chain, has agreed to buy a 40 per cent stake in a large Chinese drug store company as it boosts its exposure to the quickly growing emerging market.The Illinois-based company said on Wednesday that it has become a minority investor in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores, the retail pharmacy platform of state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (Sinopharm).Walgreens said that it acquired the stake through a capital increase by GuoDa worth Rmb2.767bn (about $416m).GuoDa, launched in 2004, operates more than 3,500 retail pharmacies in about 70 cities and employs almost 20,000 people.“We are very pleased to become a strategic investor in GuoDa. It is China’s leading pharmacy chain and we believe that we can positively contribute to its continued successful development with our global pharmacy expertise,” said Walgreens chief executive Stefano Pessina.Photo: Bloomberg
26;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Fears of Amazon drug push rattle US healthcare industry;Speculation grows that company will sell prescription medicines and drive down prices;"The US healthcare industry has become gripped in recent months by the possibility that Amazon will start selling prescription drugs, creating a powerful new competitor in a sector worth $450bn a year.Amazon has not said anything about its intentions, leaving analysts and investors to engage in a kind of corporate Kremlinology, seizing on titbits of information to gauge whether the company is plotting a move.But the mere suggestion Amazon wants to enter the market is already proving consequential.Many analysts cite the competitive threat as the primary motivation for a mooted tie-up between CVS Health, one of the largest drugstore operators, and Aetna, the health insurer.Recent moves by pharmacy chains to offer next-day home delivery for medicines have also been linked to the possibility of Amazon entering the market.It is not just the size of the opportunity that might prove tempting for Amazon, but also the chance to lower prices and disrupt an opaque industry in which it is hard to know who to blame for the soaring cost of drugs.Just about everyone in the US agrees medicines are too expensive, but the industry is torn on who is responsible, whether it be pharmaceutical companies, wholesalers, or pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who act as “middlemen” between drugmakers and their customers.“I think there’s plenty of opportunity for impactful efficiency measures to be put in place to control drug prices in this country,” says Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings, which makes software to help employers and their workers cut the amount they spend on medicine.“A new entrant like Amazon would put pressure on the pharmacies and the PBMs to do more with less.”The Amazon speculation has made an already torrid year even worse for US drugstore chains, with investors wiping more than $40bn from the market value of the biggest operators — Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS and Rite Aid — since the start of 2017.Their problems include the falling price of generic drugs, which has crimped the amount the companies make per prescription, and a woeful environment for bricks-and-mortar retailers as customers move online.“The drug retailers have a good deal to worry about because, if Amazon plays its cards right, it could offer generic drugs materially cheaper than the large players,” says Alex Schmelzer, chief executive of Mesa Rx, a pharmaceuticals cost savings consultancy.Although Amazon has kept quiet about its plans, it has become increasingly interested in healthcare in recent months, holding meetings with industry executives and making several senior hires from insurers and PBMs.The online retailer has cast a wide net in its search for talent; in the summer it hired Christine Henningsgaard, formerly chief operating officer of Hometeam, a New York start-up that offers in-home nursing and caregiving services for the elderly.Amazon confirmed the appointment of Ms Henningsgaard, who has worked in healthcare since at least 2007, but declined to elaborate on her role. Her LinkedIn profile says she works on “strategic initiatives”.The group has also invited several executives from companies operating in the pharmacy sector to its Seattle headquarters, according to two people who attended the meetings, in which participants talked about the challenges facing the industry and the high price of drugs.Many of the conversations concerned the company’s own health plan, which covers roughly 260,000 Amazon employees, and on the options for the 90,000 workers who joined the group following its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, the upscale grocery chain.But one person who attended the meetings said Amazon executives see the company’s health plan — which ranks among the largest in the US — as a “testing ground” that would prove useful if the company entered the pharmacy sector.Amazon declined to comment on the private meetings.The company has already started selling professional medical equipment, and a person briefed on its strategy said it was this part of the business that recently applied for wholesale pharmacy licences in several states.Analysts and investors had initially interpreted the award of those licences as a firm sign the company was planning to sell drugs online, but Amazon said: “Wholesale licenses are required . . . to sell professional-use only products to healthcare customers, from medical and dental offices to hospitals.”In the absence of hard facts, analysts and executives have speculated as to what an Amazon push into prescription drugs might look like.Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink, anticipates that Amazon will take on wholesalers at first, using its significant warehouse capacity and logistics experience to undercut traditional players such as McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health.“The conventional wisdom is that wholesale margins are thin, but Amazon operates on even thinner margins,” she says.Ms Gupte thinks Amazon will then quickly turn to selling drugs to consumers, using its heft to increase the low proportion of prescriptions that are delivered through the mail, which stands at roughly 10 per cent.“If Amazon makes the experience as transparent and friendly as it is for their other goods and services, then I think they will increase that penetration from a low base,” she says.The company could also dispense medicines through retail pharmacies in its more than 450 Whole Foods stores, says Ms Gupte.Join us on November 21 for a conversation about the lessons the global HIV epidemic has had for other areas of medicineHowever, she believes Amazon will stop short of setting up its own PBM because of the significant medical expertise needed for such an endeavour. PBMs have a huge influence on the drugs that patients end up taking in the US because they control the “formularies”: the master lists of drugs that employers and the government will pay for.By giving preferential treatment to some medicines over rivals on the formularies, while excluding other drugs entirely, the PBMs play a powerful if indirect role in the doctor-patient relationship. “I don’t think Amazon is going to get into the clinical stuff,” says Ms Gupte.Ian Read, chief executive of Pfizer, the largest standalone drugmaker in the US, appeared to agree when he discussed the possibility of Amazon entering the market on a call with investors last month.“Any system of distribution that can cut costs and get a wide availability of products to patients is something that the whole industry would be interested in,” he said. But he warned that entering the PBM space was a “somewhat more difficult proposal” because Amazon would be deciding on whether patients could access specific drugs.However, some large US employers want to see Amazon do exactly that, arguing it is not possible to bring down the aggregate cost of medicines without having the power to ensure patients are actually prescribed cheaper alternatives in the first place, such as generics or rival branded drugs that cost less.“The problem in the US pharmacy system is that too many prescriptions are being written that are not right for the patient,” says Rob Andrews, chief executive of the Health Transformation Alliance, a group of 40 large employer-sponsored health plans, including IBM, American Express and Verizon.“Getting the wrong drug to the patient more efficiently is not the answer to that problem,” says Mr Andrews. “We don’t want to buy a discount seat on the Titanic.”If Amazon does decide to enter the pharmacy industry, some observers expect the online retailer’s biggest challenge to come from Stefano Pessina, the Italian billionaire and chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance.Mr Pessina sits atop one of the biggest forces in healthcare, having engineered a string of deals over several decades that saw him turn his small Italian wholesaler into a drugstore giant that owns the Walgreens chain in the US and Boots in the UK.A former associate says it would be “wrong to count him out” if the pharmacy market were to enter a period of upheaval, pointing out that the consummate dealmaker had to recently abandon a takeover of Rite Aid after it was thwarted by regulators. (Mr Pessina had to content himself with buying a chunk of his smaller rival’s stores instead.)Another person who has advised Mr Pessina says the 76-year-old regards his foray into the US healthcare market as “unfinished business”. Although Mr Pessina has signed a string of agreements designed to consolidate the drug supply chain, he has not yet completed the kind of transformational deal that has become his hallmark.“Stefano is a visionary guy who engages in a lot of deal activity,” adds Leerink analyst Ana Gupte.A spokesperson for Mr Pessina declined to comment."
27;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2017-10-26T19:17:41Z;Drug retailers, wholesalers drop on opioid, Amazon news;;Shares of pharmaceutical chains and drug wholesalers are looking a little green around the gills after US President Donald Trump’s declaration that opioids are a public health emergency and a report that ecommerce giant Amazon has secured wholesale pharmacy licenses.Mr Trump’s announcement, paired with the St Louis Post-Dispatch’s report that Amazon may soon be moving in on pharmacies’ turf, send the following shares south:Amazon — which has rattled would-be competitors every time it announces a foray into a new sector, like groceries or appliances — is scheduled to report quarterly earnings after the bell.
28;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2017-09-28T11:58:58Z;Rite Aid sales fall, shares slip despite boost from Walgreens deal termination;;Rite Aid shares fell in early trade after the US drug store chain said same-store sales declined in its second quarter and as the company reported a profit thanks to the terminate fee paid by Walgreens over the failed $17.2bn takeover.Shares in the Pennsylvania-company fell 3.5 per cent to $2.20 after it said revenues for the quarter fell 4.4 per cent or by about $350.9m to $7.7bn, below analyst estimates of $7.8bn, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.Same-store sales, which measure sales at stores open at least 12 months, declined 3.4 per cent, sliding for the fifth consecutive quarter.Net income however climbed to $170.7m or 16 cents a share, compared with $14.8m or earnings per share of a penny in the year ago period due to a $325m merger termination fee from Walgreens Boots Alliance, after the deal was scrapped in June. Adjusting for those one-time benefits, Rite Aid reported a loss of a penny per diluted share, compared with the previous year’s earnings of 3 cents a share.The Rite Aid-Walgreens tie-up was among the biggest deals to be scrapped due to antitrust concerns raised by regulators appointed under the Obama administration. Instead, the two companies agreed to a new deal, with Walgreens agreeing to purchase fewer than 2,000 Rite Aid stores for $4.4bn.“While our performance for the quarter reflects a challenging reimbursement rate environment and the effects of an extended merger and asset sale process, securing regulatory clearance for the amended asset sale agreement with Walgreens Boots Alliance gives us a clear path forward to realize the benefits of the transaction and implement our plans to deliver improved results,” chief executive John Standley noted.Separately on Thursday, the company also appointed Kermit Crawford, a 30-year veteran at Walgreens, its news chief operating officer effective October 5.Rite Aid shares are down more than 70 per cent so far this year.
29;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2017-09-19T12:52:43Z;Walgreens wins US regulator approval for Rite Aid deal;;Walgreens Boots Alliance on Tuesday finally clinched US regulatory approval for its revised plans to buy nearly half of Rite Aid’s stores, following nearly two years of government review.Walgreens originally sought to buy its smaller rival for $17.2bn, including debt, when it announced the news in October 2015. However, the companies were forced to scrap the deal earlier this June after antitrust regulators expressed concerns about combining two of the country’s largest pharmacy chains.Instead, the two agreed to a new deal, in which Walgreens would purchase more than 2,000 Rite Aid stores for $5.2bn.But even this needed to be modified in the end to secure regulatory approval.In a statement on Tuesday, Walgreen said under the terms of the approved deal, it would buy 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventories from Rite Aid for $4.375bn in cash and other consideration.Rite Aid would keep the remaining 2,700 or so stores and continue to operate as a smaller, independent company.Walgreens, which operates Duane Reade and its eponymous chain of pharmacies in the US and Boots in the UK, said it expected to complete the purchasing of all 1,932 Rite Aid stores by next spring. It added that the transaction will generate more than $300m in annual synergies within four years.The ending of the original deal, which would have created the world’s largest drugstore chain by number of stores, dealt a blow to the plans of Walgreens’ billionaire chief executive Stefano Pessina to build a global drugstore group.Nonetheless, Mr Pessina struck an upbeat tone on Tuesday, saying:Combining Walgreens retail pharmacy network with a strong portfolio of Rite Aid locations is expected to help us achieve enhanced, sustainable growth while enabling us to broaden our reach and provide greater access to convenient, affordable care in more local neighborhoods across the United States. We are confident in the path ahead and look forward to working together to shape the future of health care and deliver on the full potential these stores bring to our network.
30;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Obama’s M&A legacy: another big deal bites the dust;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;If President Donald Trump is gaining a reputation for hurting US M&A due to his inability to pass tax reforms, Barack Obama seems to be solidifying his status as a deal killer even post-presidency.On Thursday, a planned $17.2bn takeover of US drugstore chain Rite Aid by its much larger rival Walgreens Boots Alliance became the latest deal to fall apart thanks to the regulatory zeal of Obama-era competition watchdogs. Yes, Donald Trump (pictured above with his predecessor in November) is six months into his presidency, but the New York businessman has not been able to make his mark on antitrust. This is indeed the feedback DD gets from some disappointed US dealmakers, who had high hopes that Trump would install quickly more business friendly regulators.But as we report:The Federal Trade Commission has only two out of five commissioners in place and both were appointed by the Obama administration. Meanwhile, Mr Trump’s nominee to head the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, has yet to be confirmed by the senate. That means that Obama appointees are still in key positions and are able to extend their regulatory legacies. That includes axing a series of megadeals that were agreed in 2015 in what was the record year for the current M&A cycle.With the takeover of Rite Aid having collapsed, the tally of deals stopped for regulatory reasons since the 2015 vintage has reached $716bn out of nearly $5tn announced in 2015. Dealogic has compiled a list for DD of the 10 biggest deals that went to the grave. But it wasn’t all bad news for Walgreens and Rite Aid, as the two agreed a new deal, where the company run by billionaire Italian chief executive Stefano Pessina (below) will purchase more than 2,000 Rite Aid stores for $5.2bn.Here are the key points about the new deal:Walgreens will acquire 2,186 stores out of the 4,523 that Rite Aid operates for $5.2bnWalgreens will pay Rite Aid a $325m termination feeWith the merger halted, a related deal in which Fred’s, a retailer, was to buy 865 stores from Walgreens and Rite Aid was also ended.The news sent Fred’s shares tumbling 22.8 per cent in New York on Thursday. Rite Aid dropped 26.5 per cent, while Walgreens shares rose 1.7 per cent.Final point: Ending the original deal, which would have created the world’s largest drugstore chain by number of stores, certainly pours cold water on Pessina’s plan to build a global drugstore group. But given the man’s appetite for dealmaking you should expect him to concoct something new very soon.

Due.Diligence@ft.comFor years we have been led to believe that Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers made the political weather in the UK. But more recently the Murdochs have done a reverse ferret, arguing their media empire is not so influential after all, something apparently backed up by the shock surge in Labour support at the recent general election.The reason for downplaying the Australian media mogul’s power? To try and smooth the path for 21st Century Fox’s £11.7bn takeover of Sky. On Thursday, however, Fox’s hopes of closing the deal by year-end were dealt a blow as UK culture secretary Karen Bradley said she was minded to refer the transaction to the Competition and Markets Authority. A report by the media watchdog Ofcom found that the deal posed a serious risk of Murdoch’s family trust (which owns controlling stakes of 39 per cent in Fox and News Corp) having too great a say over the political and media landscape. Read the FT’s full Q&A on the matter by David Bond here to learn more. Despite arguing that the explosion of new websites and social media had reduced the Murdoch influence, Ofcom said the Sun and Sky News websites were making big impacts online.The watchdog also rejected the notion that separating Fox and News Corp had reduced the chance of Murdoch’s UK newspapers joining forces with a Fox wholly owned by Sky to influence political debate. Fox offered to establish an independent editorial board for Sky News but while Ofcom accepted that move it was rejected by Bradley.Having been cleared as a fit and proper holder of a broadcasting licence — despite the ongoing scandal at Fox News in the US — the Murdochs must now come up with another plan to convince the Conservative minister that the deal to buy the 61 per cent of Sky it doesn’t already own, can finally go through.But with Theresa May’s government anything but strong and stable the fear for Murdoch is that by the time any CMA inquiry is concluded, a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn could be making the call on the deal. And that would almost certainly mean the end of the story.This is part two of a special report from Paris by DD’s Arash Massoudi. To read Part One, which was on a French charm offensive by China’s HNA Group, click here. An M&A banker is in charge of continental Europe’s second-biggest economy. But senior French bankers and lawyers that I met with this week are keen to stress that the boom in dealmaking since the start of the year has little do with the election of Emmanuel Macron (pictured).Deals involving a French target company are up 17 per cent year-on-year for a total of $74bn midway through 2017, nearly all of which were agreed before Macron was sworn in as president.Advisers also stressed that just because the newly-elected 39-year-old used to work at Rothschild’s does not mean that he will stand by and allow open season on French companies by foreign bidders. Consider the fact that in one of his first actions President Macron went to the EU and pushed for a plan to create tougher rules at the EU-level for the vetting of unwanted takeover bids. (He was defeated). Here’s how Xavier Bindel (pictured below), head of investment banking in France for JPMorgan Chase, put it: “It’s difficult to assess the impact of presidential elections as many of the largest transactions were under way before the elections and did not relate to sensitive sectors. What has changed with President Macron is that France has a new story to tell the world. If his administration is successful with its reforms, the country can break away from prior unwarranted prejudgments.”The biggest parlour game in French M&A circles relates to guessing how Macron will deal with the holdings of the French state, with particular focus on the Agence des Participations de l’Etat (APE). For the uninitiated, here is an FT Big Read from November 2016 that serves as helpful primer on just how much of the CAC 40 is held by the French state.Will Macron gradually unwind non-core holdings to support the state budget? Will he reduce holdings in companies where APE holds a huge stake and where a selldown wouldn’t effect the state’s control? Who will he put in charge of the portfolio and how much freedom will they have? These are the questions that the top French bankers are asking themselves and all are jockeying to get the first Macron mandate. With a new story to tell, DD will be keenly following the French M&A story in the months to come.

31;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2017-06-29T16:02:51Z;Walgreens halts plan to buy Rite Aid after regulatory concerns;Drugstore chain will instead buy more than 2,000 stores for $5.2bn;Walgreens Boots Alliance was forced to scrap its $17.2bn acquisition of rival Rite Aid due to competition concerns and instead agreed a new deal on Thursday to purchase more than 2,000 Rite Aid stores for $5.2bn.The decision to halt the deal announced in October 2015 came after “feedback” from the US Federal Trade Commission that “led the company to believe that the parties would not have obtained FTC clearance to consummate the merger”.Ending the original deal, which would have created the world's largest drugstore chain by number of stores, will pour cold water on the plans of Walgreens’ billionaire chief executive Stefano Pessina to build a global drugstore group.This is the latest deal announced in 2015 — a record year for proposed mergers and acquisitions — to collapse due to antitrust concerns raised by regulators appointed under the Obama administration, which had a strong enforcement record. Dealmakers have been hoping that US president Donald Trump would rapidly appoint more business-friendly competition watchdogs, but for the time being most senior antitrust jobs are being done by appointees of former president Barack Obama or are vacant. The FTC has only two out of five commissioners in place and both were appointed by the Obama administration. Meanwhile, Mr Trump’s nominee to head the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, has yet to be confirmed by the senate. Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningRegardless of regulators’ ideological background, the original combination was always considered to be a long shot merger for even the most business-friendly competition watchdog as it would have created a giant drugstore chain. Under the new agreement, Walgreens will acquire 2,186 stores out of the 4,523 that Rite Aid operates for $5.2bn, a fresh deal that should encounter no regulatory concerns with the FTC. Walgreens will also pay Rite Aid a $325m termination fee.“While we believe that pursuing the merger [with Walgreens] was the right thing to do for our investors and customers, this new agreement provides a clear path forward,” said Rite Aid chief executive John Standley. With the merger halted, a related deal in which Fred’s, a retailer, was to buy 865 stores from Walgreens and Rite Aid was also ended. The news sent Fred’s shares tumbling 20 per cent in early trading in New York. Rite Aid dropped 25 per cent, while Walgreens shares were flat.“This is the kind of deal that any federal enforcement agency under any administration would have had to challenge,” said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.The Walgreens-Rite Aid case joins a growing list of megamergers that regulators viewed as fatally anti-competitive, says Ms Moss. Last year, for example, Halliburton and Baker Hughes scrapped their $28bn marriage while Pfizer abandoned a $160bn takeover of Allergan.“We are seeing an accumulating number of deals that are just too anti-competitive to fix,” Ms Moss said.The modified deal might raise concerns at the FTC about a diminished Rite Aid’s ability to compete for orders from the pharmacy benefit managers who administer insurance prescription drug insurance, according to one prominent antitrust attorney. But ultimately, he said that he expects the modified deal to be approved.Antitrust experts do not expect dramatic changes in competition policy under the new administration. “They’re continuing to look at deals in the same way they always have,” said Andrea Murino, a partner at Goodwin Procter in Washington.Analysing the impact of potential retail industry consolidation is a straightforward exercise involving consideration of the overlap between competing outlets, she said.
32;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2017-06-26T19:49:25Z;Rite Aid shares surge on report FTC could greenlight Walgreens deal;;Shares in Rite Aid jumped more than 29 per cent to $4.02 on speculation Walgreens Boots Alliance would gain approval in its bid to takeover the US pharmacy chain.The combination of the second and third largest drugstores in the country would surpass the largest, CVS Health, and had prompted concerns from regulators who have been reviewing the deal for months.However, a report from CTFN — a news service specialising in mergers — citing former anti-trust practitioners, said the Federal Trade Commission was expected to approve the deal in a decision that could come this week.The share price increase was the company’s largest since 2015 and helped narrow its year-to-date losses to 52 per cent. In the revised terms of the deal, Walgreens had offered to pay $6.50 to $7 per share and had proposed divest between 1,000 and 1,200 stores to Fred’s pharmacy chain.Shares in Walgreens were 1.5 per cent higher at $77.46 on the day, while Fred’s shares increased 20.5 per cent to $12.35.
33;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2017-06-09T16:39:12Z;Rite Aid shares plunge on latest reports of Walgreens deal turbulence;;Shares of US drug-store chain Rite Aid tumbled as much as 17 per cent on Friday on the latest report that regulators are moving closer to lodging a legal objection to its proposed tie-up with rival Walgreens Boots Alliance.Trading in the stock was briefly halted after Bloomberg, citing trade publication Capitol Forum, said that antitrust regulators at the Federal Trade Commission are compiling their recommendation that a lawsuit be lodged to block the deal.By pixel time, the losses were trimmed to about 12 per cent — the latest in a series of blows to Rite Aid shares amid gloomy reports about the deal’s prospects of passing antitrust clearance since it was announced back in 2015.At that time, Walgreens said it would pay $9 a share, but earlier this year, Walgreens said it would pony up just $6.50-$7 a share, valuing the deal between $6.82bn and $7.35bn.Walgreens shares were down 0.5 per cent on the report, while shares of rival pharmacy chain Fred’s — which stood to benefit from assets divested in order to secure approval — were down 5.7 per cent.
34;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
35;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2017-04-05T11:56:24Z;Walgreens quarterly sales slip as strong dollar weighs;;Walgreens Boots Alliance posted a dip in quarterly revenues, which came in slightly short of Wall Street expectations, as a strong dollar dented its international business.The Illinois-based pharmacy chain said sales fell 2.4 per cent year-on-year to $29.4bn in the quarter through the end of February, compared with forecasts of $30.3bn. However, on a comparable currency basis, sales would have been up by 0.9 per cent.Walgreen’s large US retail pharmacy unit posted a 1.5 per cent increase in sales, helped by strength in pharmacy sales that was somewhat offset by the retail side.The group pegged the retail weakness on “a challenging market, with declines in the consumables and general merchandise category and the personal care category partially offset by solid growth in the health and wellness category and the beauty category”.The international retail pharmacy’s sales declined by 14.5 per cent, “mainly due to currency translation”. Pharmaceutical wholesale sales also took a hit thanks to the strong buck.Net profits rose 14 per cent to $1.1bn. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share of $1.36 met analyst expectations.Walgreens said that it was still “actively engaged in discussions” with US antitrust regulators over its planned tie-up with Rite Aid.The group’s shares slipped 0.6 per cent in pre-market trading.
36;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2017-03-06T05:00:40Z;Alliance Boots dealmaker Dominic Murphy set to leave KKR;Executive instrumental in acquisition of UK chain and its later merger with Walgreens;Dominic Murphy, the executive behind one of KKR’s most successful investments, is leaving the buyout firm, according to several people briefed on the move.Mr Murphy was instrumental in orchestrating the £12bn acquisition of UK pharmacy chain Alliance Boots in 2007, in what became Europe’s largest leveraged buyout, as well as its subsequent merger with US rival Walgreens.The transaction is credited with boosting KKR’s reputation in Europe and establishing Mr Murphy’s reputation as a skilled private equity practitioner. He is leaving to pursue “his own personal investment activities”, one person familiar with his departure said.The debt-laden takeover — just before the financial crisis — saw KKR join forces with Stefano Pessina, then Alliance Boots’ executive deputy chairman and largest shareholder, to see off a rival bid led by Guy Hands’ Terra Firma. Questions were raised at the time over the scale of the £9bn debt taken on by KKR, but the buyout firm eventually made £4.5bn — 4.5 times its initial investment.Mr Murphy, who joined KKR in 2005, made his decision to leave late last year because he did not intend to take part in KKR’s new fund cycle. His decision has already been announced privately to investors and employees. “[Mr Murphy] said he’s been here for 10 years, and obviously he made a lot of money, and he decided he wants to do something different,” a senior person briefed on the matter said. KKR declined to comment.Join FT Commentators in London on March 20 to discuss the turmoil affecting markets today.“These private equity guys are generally pretty arrogant, but Dominic differentiated himself among his peers and was always willing to listen and make tough decisions in tight situations,” said one person who has worked with Mr Murphy. “The Alliance Boots deal was a great contribution to the sector and made KKR a lot of money.” Johannes Huth, who built KKR’s presence in Europe and remains its head, has been quick to assuage any investor anxiety over the departure, highlighting that a number of experienced partners and directors remain with the firm. The company is looking for a senior person to fill Mr Murphy’s position in the firm’s healthcare division. Tim Franks, a veteran who joined KKR in February this year from buyout firm Advent International, will take Mr Murphy’s place on the European investment committee as well as his UK coverage, people with direct knowledge of the situation said. Mr Franks will also sit on KKR’s European portfolio management committee.[Mr Murphy] said he’s been here for 10 years, and obviously he made a lot of money, and he decided he wants to do something differentThe firm is deploying money for its current fund, but it is understood that KKR could start a new fundraising round as early as this year.Alliance Boots became the first FTSE 100 company to be taken into private ownership, shining a spotlight on the actions of the private equity firm. In addition to the impact on the company’s workforce, the deal drew attention in particular to the level of fees firms charge their own investors.While the debt at Alliance Boots foundered initially, KKR and Mr Pessina relied on the recession-proof nature of the business to revive its fortunes.They later engineered a two-step deal whereby Walgreens acquired a large minority stake in 2012, followed by the remainder of the business in 2014, for a total of $23bn. The company has been renamed Walgreens Boots Alliance. Soon after the Walgreens takeover was completed, its head departed and Mr Pessina was named chief executive. The transactions have made Mr Pessina one of Italy’s richest men.
37;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2017-01-30T20:23:46Z;Walgreens Boots Alliance: range rover;A company only takes a deal price cut when it has little leverage;Companies usually give themselves wriggle room when providing an earnings forecast by stating a range. They rarely do so for the price of an agreed buyout.But this is how Walgreens Boots Alliance is dealing with US drugstore chain Rite Aid. The pharmacy juggernaut offered to pay $9.00 per share, or $18bn in total, back in 2015.On Monday, the companies agreed to reduce the acquisition price to some figure between $6.50 and $7.00 per share, while allowing another six months for the deal to close.This revisionism reflects a long antitrust review, as the US regulator decides how many locations must be shed.Walgreens has said that it still believes that the combination could create $1bn in cost savings initially targeted, despite any asset sales. And if it can ultimately clinch the deal, the acquirer may pay $2.5bn less than it planned.A $6.50 per share purchase price would represent a 7 per cent premium from the day before Walgreens announced the deal. Walgreens shares are down a tenth since then.For Rite Aid, a reduced, all-cash takeout offer seems like the least-worst alternative. The US pharmacy industry is dominated by two big groups, Walgreens and CVS, so there are few other potential buyers.The ultimate Rite Aid purchase price is determined by how many stores Walgreens is forced to divest.If 1,000 stores are identified, the higher purchase price is invoked. If 1,200 stores, then the lower figure. The pair have already signed an agreement to sell 865 stores to a tiny chain, Fred’s.That disposal is now judged inadequate by a US regulator with a beady eye trained on the effectiveness of divestitures.Under ambitious chairman Stefano Pessina, Walgreens has transformed into a hydra-headed, global pharma machine that has successfully negotiated the unyielding cost pressures facing the sector.It is a tribute to that business’s formidable scale that it can agree a price cut with a vendor thanks to regulatory uncertainty. Lesser acquirers are left to watch in envy.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
38;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Rite Aid tumbles after Walgreens cuts price on deal;;Shares in Rite Aid sank more than 17 per cent in early trading on Monday after the US retail pharmacy chain said Walgreens Boots Alliance would cut at least $2.1bn off the price of their merger agreement.Walgreens had originally agreed in October 2015 to buy Rite Aid for $9 a share, or $9.45bn, as well as take on its smaller rival’s net debt of $7.75bn.However, the two companies said on Monday they have agreed to a new deal that would now value the company at $6.50 to $7.00 a share – or no more than $7.35bn.The final price will ultimately be determined by the number of stores Walgreens Boots would be required to sell in order to receive anti-trust approval for the deal – which would create a global drugstore group with over 12,700 stores.The companies said:The exact price per share will be determined based on the number of required store divestitures, with the price set at $7.00 per share if 1,000 stores or fewer are required for divestiture and at $6.50 per share if 1,200 stores are required for divestiture. If the required divestitures fall between 1,000 and 1,200 stores, then there will be a pro-rata adjustment of the price per share.Walgreens Boots Alliance agreement to divest up to 1,200 Rite Aid stores represents an increase of up to 200 stores over the 1,000 stores that Walgreens Boots Alliance had agreed to divest under the terms of the original agreement.The new agreement comes amid reports that anti-trust officials have raised concerns about the proposed Walgreens Boots-Rite Aid tie-up. This comes even after the two companies reached a deal to sell 865 Rite Aid stores to Fred’s Inc for $950m last year.The pharmacy giants also said the closing date for the merger would face a further delay, to July 2017. The two companies had already been forced to push back the closing date from October 27 last year to January 27 this year as they looked for a buyer for some of their stores.
39;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2017-01-20T16:07:13Z;Rite Aid shares dive after report antitrust officials question Walgreens merger;;Shares of pharmacy chain Rite Aid are down more than 13 per cent on Friday, as a report said that US antitrust officials have raised concerns about Walgreens Boots Alliance’s proposed bid for its smaller rival.Following discussions with Federal Trade Commission staff about the merger – valued at $17.2bn, including debt – Walgreens and Rite Aid had said last year that they had reached a deal to sell 865 Rite Aid stores to Fred’s Inc for $950m, pending regulatory approval, “in response to concerns identified by the FTC” during its review. Walgreens said at the time that it was actively engaged in discussions with the FTC and aimed to close the deal in early 2017.But Bloomberg reported on Friday that the plan to win clearance for the deal “hasn’t satisfied officials” at the FTC, citing sources familiar with the matter. The report said that officials “aren’t sold” on the plan to divest the stores to allay antitrust concerns.Walgreens shares were down 1.6 per cent on Friday.
40;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2017-01-15T14:21:15Z;Stefano Pessina, Walgreens Boots Alliance, on dealmaking;The 75-year-old billionaire still wants to build a presence in China;"Stefano Pessina pats his stomach and says: “I love good wine and good food. I eat just once a day, at dinner, because I don’t conceive of a meal without a good bottle of wine, and I couldn’t drink during the day.”Our interview takes place during the daytime, so sustenance comes in the form of coffee and a bottle of fizzy water. The espresso cup and San Pellegrino bottle are the only features in his otherwise empty corner office, which overlooks the car park of the Walgreens Boots Alliance headquarters in Deerfield, a dreary Chicago suburb.It is rare to find a chief executive who is a self-confessed gourmand, let alone one who stands atop one of the largest healthcare companies, which has the slogan “at the corner of healthy and happy”.The pharmacy chain is poised to become bigger still if US regulators allow the company to acquire rival US pharmacy group RiteAid, with a final decision expected in days. If consummated, it would seal Mr Pessina’s reputation as a serial dealmaker.“Many people say that I am a dealmaker, which is probably true,” says the 75-year-old billionaire. “But I am always very cold when I do a deal. A deal must have a strategic logic, and it must create value.”That philosophy has taken him from being a small-time wholesaler in Italy to one of the most powerful figures in global healthcare.As a student of nuclear engineering in the 1960s, Mr Pessina had hoped to become an academic but disagreed with the leftwing politics of university campuses. He was concerned too about the direction of Italy, then in the grip of “the years of lead”, a reference to the internal violence that defined the 1970s.Dominic Murphy of KKR has been a friend and close partner of Stefano Pessina for more than 10 years. He says: “It was clear from the outset that Stefano was a visionary entrepreneur. His ambition, total determination, intellect and relentless focus transformed a local Italian pharmaceutical wholesaler into a global health and wellbeing business that employs 400,000 people today.”He left the Politecnico di Milano for AC Nielsen, the global marketing research group, before taking over his father’s failing drugs wholesaler in 1974. His father bequeathed him the business to see if he could salvage it.He turned the company around and then started to acquire other businesses, including one owned by entrepreneur Ornella Barra. She became his romantic partner and still works alongside him.Mr Pessina says his ambitions stretched beyond Italy after he grew tired of its bureaucracy and the influence of organised crime. “The involvement of politics was too heavy; the compromise with parts of society — criminality — was more evident. It made it very difficult for a company like us.”In 1991, he negotiated a deal with two French companies to form Alliance Santé. This became a template for the transactions that would take him to the top of Walgreens Boots Alliance — each time Mr Pessina merged his company with a larger one, he went on to lead the combined entity.Next was a merger with Unichem, the British pharmacy group, which took Mr Pessina into the business of selling drugs directly to consumers. He had hoped to build a pan-European pharmacy chain, although his plan was resisted by several countries, including France, Italy and Spain.That provided the impetus for Mr Pessina to merge Alliance Unichem with Boots, the UK pharmacist, in 2006. “To be honest, the deal was not a fantastic success,” he says. The company persuaded shareholders to back the acquisition with the promise of savings, but struggled to implement them because of “a very big, very conservative” board of directors.And so Mr Pessina embarked on the deal that has become his calling card. Along with KKR, the US private equity group, he took Alliance Boots private in 2007, in a leveraged buyout funded by £9bn of debt. The backdrop was inauspicious and many predicted the pharmacy chain would collapse. Barely a month went by over the next couple of years without a well-known retailer disappearing from British high streets.“People thought we were mad with the debt, but in reality we ended up in a very nice spot,” he recalls. “Boots needed a lot of investment and a clear strategy. Before, the stores were underinvested.”Mr Pessina had long coveted some kind of deal that would take him to the US, the world’s largest healthcare market. “By the time of Boots I had really started to cultivate the ambition of being global and to do that you must have a foot in the US,” he says.Alliance Boots eventually sold itself to Walgreens in a two-part deal that saw the US group pay about $23bn for its British rival.The merger has ended up as a Anglo-European affair. The combined company is predominantly run by former Alliance Boots executives from the other side of the Atlantic, including two Scots, and Ms Barra, who heads several international units.Mr Pessina took the role of chief executive shortly after the merger, following the departure of his predecessor, Greg Wasson. Once again the Italian billionaire ended up in charge.He bristles at the suggestion it was planned. “When you merge a company, you have to select the best people,” he says. “[Greg] had a difficult relationship with the shareholders, and he decided to leave. Nobody pushed him away.”Mr Pessina admits to being wary about sentiment, which he says is notably anti-business. The answer, he suggests, is to tackle growing inequality.“We have to find a way to give people an acceptable life, not a lavish life, but a decent life,” he says. It is an argument that one might not expect to hear from a man whose own wealth is estimated at $13bn by Forbes.His last big ambition is to build a presence in China. “I have struggled to do it,” he says.How long does he expect to stay at Walgreens Boots Alliance? “As chief executive? I don’t know. In a role where I will continue to be useful to the company? Maybe for some years.”"
41;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2017-01-05T12:48:15Z;Walgreens lifts lower end of earnings guidance;;Walgreens Boots Alliance has boosted the lower end of its full year earnings guidance as it reiterated its confidence that regulators will greenlight its planned $17.2bn acquisition of rival Rite Aid.The operator of Walgreens and Duane Reade drugstores said it now expects adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal 2017 year (which ends in August) to come in at $4.90 to $5.20, compared to its previous forecast of $4.85 to $5.20.“This guidance assumes accretion of $0.05 to $0.12 from Rite Aid,” it said.Walgreens Boots, the US’s second largest pharmacy chain by sales agreed to buy smaller rival Rite Aid back in October 2015. However the tie-up – which would create a global drugstore group with over 12,700 stores – has been delayed by US anti-trust regulators.As part of its efforts to win over regulators, Walgreens Boots struck an agreement last month to sell off 865 Rite Aid stores for $950m, and thereby removing one of the last remaining hurdles to the deal.The revised guidance comes as Walgreens Boots reported a surprise drop in sales during its first fiscal quarter. For the three months to end of November, sales fell 1.8 per cent to $28.5bn – compared to expectations of a modest uptick to $29.18bn – as rising prescriptions sales in the US failed to offset the impact of the collapse in the British pound.Its international business – which consists mainly of the Boots pharmacy chain in the UK – saw first quarter sales drop 14.4 per cent to $3bn compared to the year ago period.Walgreens Boots reports its earnings in dollars and the 17 per cent drop in the pound since the June Brexit vote means its sterling earnings are now worth significantly less in dollar terms. On a constant currency basis, Walgreens Boots said international sales increased 0.5 per cent.Net income for the quarter was $1.05bn, or 97 cents per diluted share, compared to $1.11bn, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier.Despite the sales drop, Stefano Pessina, Walgreens Boots’s chief executive, said the company raised the lower end of its guidance because it sees “the business performing in line with our expectations.”Overall we are pleased with the progress this quarter, with results in line with our expectations. We continue to anticipate that growth in the second half of fiscal 2017 will reflect the new strategic pharmacy partnerships we announced last year.
42;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Rite Aid sells 865 stores ahead of Walgreens merger;;Walgreens Boots Alliance has taken one step closer to ensuring its merger with Rite Aid goes through after it struck a deal to sell off 865 Rite Aid stores to Fred’s Pharmacy for $950m.Walgreens, the US’s second largest pharmacy chain by sales agreed to buy smaller rival Rite Aid back in October 2015 for $17.2bn including debt.However the tie-up – which would create a global drugstore group with over 12,700 stores – has been delayed by US anti-trust regulators. The Federal Trade Commission has demanded the two companies divest between 500 to 1,000 retail stores in order for the deal to be approved.The merger was originally supposed to close on October 27, but the two companies were forced to push back the closing date to January 27, 2017 as they look for a buyer for some of their stores.Tuesday’s all-cash deal with Fred’s should help remove one of the last remaining hurdles to the deal.“We are pleased to have found an experienced pharmacy operator for these stores,” said Stefano Pessina, Walgreens’s chief executive, adding:With this agreement, we are moving ahead with important work necessary to obtain approval of our acquisition of Rite Aid. We look forward to continuing to provide our customers and patients with the highest level of care and attention.Shares in Rite Aid rose more than 5 per cent on the news. Those for Walgreens edged up 0.2 per cent while Fred’s stock zipped 88 per cent higher to $86.21.
43;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2016-11-01T22:58:46Z;KKR to exit Walgreens Boots Alliance;;US private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) is exiting Walgreens Boots Alliance through a share sale, the company said on Tuesday.Walgreens said that affiliates of KKR plan to sell 20.46m shares in a secondary offering. Goldman Sachs will act as the sole underwriter for the offering.Separately, the shareholders entered into an agreement to sell 2m shares to an affiliate of Walgreen’s chief executive Stefano Pessina at the same price as the shares that will be sold to the underwriter in the proposed offering.The company had issued 52.46m shares to the shareholders as part of the Walgreens tie-up with Alliance Boots in 2014. The investors sold 30m shares in two other previous offerings earlier this year. With Tuesday’s announcement, KKR will have exited the company.Mr Pessina and KKR had taken Alliance Boots private in 2007 in a roughly £12bn deal. In 2012 they sold a 45 per cent stake to Walgreens and completed the sale to the US pharmacy chain Walgreens in 2014.
44;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Walgreens posts profit beat as it says Rite Aid deal on track;;Drug-store chain operator Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc on Thursday posted fourth-quarter profits that beat analysts’ estimates as it pushed back slightly the target closing date for its planned $9.4bn takeover of smaller US rival Rite Aid until early next year.Walgreens had initially expected the deal to close by the end of 2016, but said on Thursday it now aims to secure all necessary approvals by early 2017. It has faced headwinds, however, as grocery chain Kroger reportedly has balked at buying some of its and Rite Aid’s stores. The company said in its earnings release that the deal was “progressing as planned.”During the fourth quarter, Walgreens’ adjusted earnings per share beat the $0.99 forecast by analysts, coming in at $1.07, thanks in part to growing sales at its retail pharmacy division, which saw fourth-quarter sales rise 4 per cent compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, to $20.7bn.It said that it filled 229.5m prescriptions during the past three months, a 3.7 per cent increase from the same period in 2015. However, its revenue missed the $29.07bn predicted by analysts, coming in at $28.6bn for the quarter.Walgreens announced earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2017 of $4.85-$5.20, after posting an 18 per cent rise in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from 2016 of $4.59. Its guidance for the next year assumes a $0.05-$0.12 accretion from the Rite Aid deal, which could require the divestiture of between 500 and 1,000 stores to secure approval from antitrust regulators at the US Federal Trade Commission.Walgreens said its operating income was lifted 36.4 per cent to $1.1bn during the last quarter in part by improving retail pharmacy sales, which beat the $901m predicted by analysts. The company’s shares were knocked down slightly in pre-market trading.
45;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Boots steps into South Korea pharmacy market;Nasdaq-listed company Walgreens Boots Alliance agrees franchise deal selling products for local tastes;Stefano Pessina, the serial Walgreens dealmaker who has marched his pharmacy empire across four continents already, is moving into South Korea with a franchise deal for the Boots healthcare chain.The brand, ubiquitous on British high streets, will appear in Korean shopping malls and inside some branches of Emart, the hypermarket group that has been chosen to run the stores.“South Korea is considered a leading market for skincare and cosmetics products in Asia today,” said Ornella Barra, who is co-chief operating officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance and Mr Pessina’s long-term partner.The Nasdaq-listed company says its Korean outpost will stock products tailored to local tastes, including a range of leading local cosmetics brands and over-the-counter medicine.But the outlets will also carry imported skincare products under the “No7” private label, long a fixture in British bathroom cabinets, which was introduced into US branches of Walgreens and Duane Reade in 2012.Many of the products are made in Nottingham in the UK, where agricultural worker John Boot opened the first store in 1849.Since 2006, when the British company merged with Mr Pessina’s Alliance UniChem, it has been at the centre of the billionaire’s ambition to annex swaths of the global pharmacy business.A year later Mr Pessina teamed up with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts to take the combined company private, and set about replacing a fragmented market of local operators with an integrated business of global scale.The foray into South Korea via a franchise agreement is more tentative step, but bears similarities with his earlier approach in continental Europe, where — constrained by regulations that require pharmacies to be independently owned — he signed up local retailers to join his wholesale network rather than operating stores directly.The company has taken a similar approach in the Middle East, where 100 Boots stores are run by the Alshaya retail conglomerate.But Mr Pessina has a history of turning such commercial agreements into sweeping deals that place him at the centre.His relationship with Walgreens began with the sale of a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots in 2012.Two years later he combined the two companies and installed himself as chief executive. Last year, with the acquisition of Rite Aid, the company supplanted CVS as America’s biggest pharmacy chain.Walgreens’ Asian interests include Boots Thailand, a wholly owned retail business that has 250 stores. The company also has stakes in a chain of stores in China and in pharmaceuticals wholesalers in the country.Mr Pessina made about £500m from the original acquisition of Alliance Boots. His 13 per cent stake in Walgreens is worth about $11bn.

It also said, “Our professional standard is clear, services must be for the benefit of patients not the attainment of numerical targets.”Mr Roberts said in a statement:I feel very privileged and fortunate to have had 13 happy years at Boots and the opportunity to work alongside a great team, and with many exceptionally talented people. As Boots is such an extraordinary company with a compelling and life changing purpose this of course has been a difficult decision to make.Thursday’s announcement comes as part of a broader management shake-up at parent company Walgreens Boots Alliance. Alex Gourlay, executive vice-president of WBA, was appointed co-chief operating officer, along with Ornella Barra, another executive vice-president at the company. Mr Gourlay will oversee both Walgreens and Boots in his new role. He was previously managing director of Boots UK.Walgreens completed the final step in its merger with Alliance Boots in December 2014 and became the world’s largest buyer of prescription drugs.

48;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2016-06-08T15:05:58Z;Valeant scrambles to restructure Walgreens deal;New chief executive will consider pulling the plug on unprofitable agreement within months;Valeant is attempting to restructure a deal with Walgreens after warning it is losing money on a large chunk of medicines sold through the chain of US drugstores, according to people briefed on the matter. The Canadian drugmaker will consider terminating the agreement within months unless the situation improves, these people said.Shares in Valeant tumbled on Tuesday after the drugmaker slashed its annual profit forecasts for the third time in six months, a move it blamed in part on its deal with Walgreens, which dispenses many of its best-selling medicines.Walgreens is filling prescriptions for some of the company’s top drugs without first ensuring that the patient’s health insurer will pay for them, resulting in losses for Valeant, said chief executive Joseph Papa on Tuesday.“That means every time a prescription goes out the door, we’re taping dollar bills [to it],” Mr Papa said. He said two days later, “While the access program has some problems that we are working to address, Walgreens has fulfilled its obligations under our agreement and we are looking forward to continuing to work with them.”The deal was announced last year after Valeant was forced to terminate its relationship with Philidor, a chain of mail order pharmacies under its control that blew up following an accounting scandal. When Mr Papa’s predecessor, Mike Pearson, signed the agreement with Stefano Pessina, the Italian billionaire who runs Walgreens, it was seen as a coup because it paired Valeant with a company that had a much better reputation.But people familiar with the contract say Mr Pessina negotiated a very favourable deal for Walgreens in exchange for supporting the drugmaker, which was reeling from the accounting irregularities, as well as a political outcry over the high price of its medicines. The drugstore receives a fee for dispensing the drugs regardless of whether Valeant is reimbursed, meaning it benefits even if insurers refuse to cover medicines, according to people who have seen the contract. The problem has arisen because many patients with health insurers are required to secure approval from their insurers before they receive some of Valeant’s expensive medicines, such as Jublia, a toenail fungus cream that retails at more than $1,000 for an 8-milliliter bottle. But about a quarter of Valeant drugs sold through Walgreens are being dispensed without securing this “prior authorisation”, the people said, resulting in losses for the drugmaker. That is a much higher proportion than was the case at Philidor, which was accused of using aggressive methods to ensure that insurers would pay up. Company spokeswoman Laurie Little said in a statement, “We have a great relationship with Walgreens and are working closely with them to address some issues that have come up in the first few months of our 20-year contract. Valeant is strongly committed to the access program, and we are confident that we will be able to resolve the issues in the near term and improve the patient and prescriber experiences.”The people said Mr Papa would consider terminating the agreement with Walgreens unless things improve quickly, and believes that a “material adverse change” clause in the contract would provide legal cover for him to do so. He has set a deadline of a couple of months to turn things around. However, he is committed to trying to restructure the deal first, which has only been in place for a few months, the people said. He has several meetings scheduled with Walgreens executives to see if they can find a way forward. Mr Papa is contemplating hiring a third party company to help doctors secure approvals when they write prescriptions for patients, and has held discussions with CoverMyMeds, a private Ohio-based group that describes itself as the “leader in electronic prior authorisation”. Mr Papa is also considering increasing the amount that patients must pay out of their own pockets for prescription medicines. Other options include giving the first prescription away for free but refusing to provide refills unless the customers pay for their drugs entirely in cash. Valeant is struggling to regain its footing after a torrid twelve months, during which its market value has plunged from $90bn to $10bn. Mr Papa was last month hired by Mr Ackman to try to restore the company’s fortunes. Walgreens declined to comment.
49;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2016-02-29T18:35:44Z;Walgreens sits at the centre of three healthcare storms;Pharmacy chain exposed to fortunes of sector’s most contentious names;"Three healthcare companies have dominated the headlines in recent months, for the wrong reasons.Valeant, the Canadian drugmaker, has been accused of “gouging” customers with high prices and was forced to restate earnings after incorrectly booking revenues from a pharmacy chain accused of accounting fraud.Theranos, the blood testing start-up, has fallen from its perch as a darling of Silicon Valley, following claims that its technology is overhyped and its labs are unsafe.And Turing Pharmaceuticals has become a pariah for hiking the price of a life-saving drug from $13.50 to $750 a pill, just months before its founder and former chief executive was charged for running a “Ponzi-like scheme”— allegations he denies as baseless.If one were to draw a Venn diagram, the company in the centre would be Walgreens; the US pharmacy chain has partnerships or contractual relationships with all three groups.Walgreens is the largest US pharmacy chain, with more than 8,000 outlets that account for roughly a third of the drugstore market, which is worth about $216bn a year. In January, the group reported a 27.4 per cent rise in first quarter net earnings from $877m to $1.1bn compared with the same period in 2015.In December 2014, the company completed the final step of its merger with Alliance Boots, owner of Boots the chemist in the UK, to create Walgreens Boots Alliance — the world’s largest buyer of prescription drugs.Shortly after, Stefano Pessina, the Italian billionaire and architect of the deal, became chief executive of the group, prompting many investors to predict that the historically sleepy company would adopt a more aggressive posture.They did not have to wait long: in October, the group said it would buy its smaller rival, Rite Aid, for about $9.4bn, a deal that would cement its leadership over rival CVS Health.Walgreens has sidestepped what would have been a huge controversy, by declining to move Walgreens Boots Alliance to the UK or another lower-tax jurisdiction in an “inversion” designed to slash the company’s tax bill.The group has not shied away from other contentious deals, however.“They are certainly more willing to do things that are creative, and to foster agreements with those who are more controversial,” says Ross Muken, analyst at Evercore ISI.The agreements were signed at different times and for different reasons, but each has left the company exposed to the fortunes of three of the most beleaguered names in healthcare.In December, Walgreens struck another audacious deal, this time with Valeant. The drugmaker was searching for a new partner after Philidor, a tangled network of pharmacies under its control, was forced out of business amid claims of fraud — strenuously denied — and aggressive sales tactics.Under the 20-year agreement, patients will be able to obtain some of Valeant’s best-selling products at a lower price if they fulfil their prescription at Walgreens, or at participating independent pharmacies.Many details of the tie-up have not been revealed, but a person who worked on the deal described it as a “win-win” for Walgreens.Despite Valeant’s tarnished reputation, many dermatologists still like its products, such as Jublia, a toenail fungus cream with a sticker price of $1,000 a bottle; almost 14,000 prescriptions are written for the ointment each week.Walgreens was for generations a family business, but now there is a very different philosophy that looks at the financials of each deal — and it is a strategy that carries some riskWhen physicians direct their patients to Walgreens for the cheapest prices, the pharmacy chain benefits in two ways: by collecting a fee for dispensing the medicines, and by increasing footfall in its stores.Mr Pessina helped to negotiate the agreement, and was thanked at an investor event by Michael Pearson, Valeant’s chief executive, in December, shortly before he was hospitalised and took medical leave.Some of Walgreens’ competitors privately say, however, that the company is taking a big risk with its reputation, aligning itself with a shaky group known for high prices at a time when rivals are publicly trying to drive down costs.People briefed on the deal say Mr Pessina extracted a high price in exchange for the credibility that the Walgreens brand confers upon Valeant.Adam Fein, analyst at Pembroke Consulting, says the pharmacy chain would have been less likely to team up with Valeant under Mr Pessina’s predecessor, or in the years when it was still run by the Walgreen family.“The new management team is much more risk-taking,” he says. “Walgreens was for generations a family business, but now there is a very different philosophy that looks at the financials of each deal — and it is a strategy that carries some risk.”If Valeant is very much Mr Pessina’s deal, then Theranos is very much not.Struck in 2013, when Greg Wasson was chief executive, the agreement saw Theranos open about 40 of its direct-to-consumer blood testing clinics in Walgreens’ Arizona stores. It was part of a broader push by the drugstore to become a one-stop health destination; a cross between a community clinic and pharmacist.However, since last autumn Theranos has been beset by claims that its technology is inaccurate, or, worse still, unsafe.Walgreens executives have become impatient with the partnership, which they now see as a distraction that takes up too much time considering that Theranos outlets are sited in a fraction of its more than 8,000 stores, according to people familiar with the matter.Earlier this month, Walgreens urged Theranos to suspend testing pending the reception of an improvement plan it submitted to the laboratories regulator in response to a scathing report. Theranos declined and is awaiting the regulator’s reply.Walgreens’ relationship with Turing, perhaps the most toxic name in pharmaceuticals, could charitably be put down to bad luck.The pharmacy chain’s “speciality” division is the sole distributor of Daraprim, a life-saving drug often given to Aids and cancer patients, acquired last year by Turing, which promptly increased the price from $13.50 to $750 per pill.One factor discouraging companies from producing a copycat version of the off-patent drug is that it is sold under “controlled distribution” through Walgreens, which makes it harder for generic drugmakers to obtain samples of the medicine so they can recreate it.Walgreens points out it signed the distribution agreement with one of Daraprim’s previous owners, not Turing, and that it has repeatedly called on the company to widen access and cut the price. But the arrangement means it has become inadvertently associated with Turing’s attempt to keep the price of the medicine high.Mr Fein says that Walgreens’ status as the largest pure pharmacy chain makes it an ideal partner for companies such as Valeant and Turing, because it has an incentive to drive higher prescription volumes.Conversely, many of the other “specialty pharmacies” that distribute high-price drugs are controlled by so-called pharmacy benefits managers such as Express Scripts and CVS, which work on behalf of employers and insurance companies to help control the cost of medicines.That means they often demand discounts in exchange for distributing a product, and implement programmes designed to limit the overall number of prescriptions."
50;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Walgreens looks to cut ties with Theranos;Pharmacy chain weighs whether it can terminate its contract with the blood-testing start-up;Walgreens, the US pharmacy chain, is seeking ways to terminate its relationship with Theranos after growing impatient with the blood-testing start-up’s mounting regulatory woes, according to people familiar with the matter.The group has asked lawyers to examine its contract with Theranos, to see whether there is a way of forcing the group led by Elizabeth Holmes to close the roughly 40 blood-testing clinics it has set up in the company’s Arizona drugstores, the people said.The move represents an escalation in the stand-off between the two companies, after the pharmacy wrote to Theranos earlier this month giving it a 30-day deadline to resolve problems at its California laboratory. The lab was the subject of a damning inspection report in January that warned of “immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety”.At the time, Walgreens tried, unsuccessfully, to convince Theranos to suspend all blood tests while it worked through the issues identified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which regulates testing labs in the US.However, executives at Walgreens have since concluded there is little chance that Theranos can quickly resolve its regulatory problems and are now resigned to the partnership ending, the people said.In addition to the failings at its California lab, Theranos has suspended the use of its proprietary finger-prick vials to collect patients’ blood for almost all of the tests its offers, after the Food and Drug Administration censured the company for using an unapproved medical device.“They’ve been unhappy with the relationship and it’s really a question of working through the contractual and legal arrangements,” said a person familiar with the matter. “They’re not interested in the Theranos deal.”Walgreens executives are frustrated by the amount of negative publicity generated by the partnership, especially given that the Theranos “Wellness Centers” are locatedin only a tiny fraction of its more than 8,000 stores.Theranos believes Walgreens has little legal basis for terminating the partnership, according to a person advising the company. Theranos has submitted an improvement plan to CMS and is seeking approval for its nanotainer from the FDA.Walgreens and Theranos declined to comment.If the drugstore chain were to force Theranos to close the clinics in its stores, it would be a significant blow to the start-up, because the Walgreens locations account for almost all of its outlets.Arizona is the only US state that allows patients to order blood tests without first seeing a doctor, after the Republican-dominated legislature changed the law following a lobbying effort by Theranos.
51;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Boots cutting 300-350 UK management jobs;;Boots is proposing to cut 300 to 350 managerial jobs in the UK as the chain, which is part of the US health and pharmacy heavyweight Walgreens Boots Alliance, tries to simplify its business.The company says it “beginning formal consultations with assistant store managers in larger stores across the country” in regards to the proposed job cuts.Simon Roberts, president of Boots, said:Everything we do at Boots is about helping people feel good. So many of our colleagues deliver amazing care for our patients, customers and communities everyday and we are actively working to make sure our people are rewarded for the great work they continue to do.I believe our plans will enable us to build an even better Boots and drive future growth.Last year Boots, which can trace its history back to 1849, made 700 job cuts in the UK as part of its latest strategy to focus on higher growth areas, such as digital sales.

Alibaba’s shares dropped 5.9 per cent to $72.77.Several casino companies that have large operations in Macau fell sharply amid fears that a cooling Chinese economy and a corruption crackdown by Beijing will keep gamblers away.Wynn Resorts, which generated 58.7 per cent of its revenue from Macau in the third quarter, sold off by 9.4 per cent to $60.19. Las Vegas Sands dropped 9.1 per cent to $39.79.Also in the red on Thursday were so-called cyclical stocks, which tend to be sensitive to economic fluctuations. Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of heavy machinery, dropped 3.4 per cent to $63.94, a steeper fall than US markets more broadly.Metals miners suffered as the price of copper, a key industrial commodity, slumped 1.6 per cent, touching the lowest level since 2009. Freeport-McMoRan, a large copper miner, slid 9.2 per cent to $5.61.Elsewhere KB Home shares fell 14.8 per cent to $10.05 after the homebuilder reported disappointing fourth-quarter results.The Los Angeles-based company reported profits of $44.1m, or 43 cents a share, on sales of $985.8m. This was short of Wall Street estimates for earnings of 50 cents a share, on sales of $1.1bn.KB Home delivered 2,580 homes last quarter, up 16 per cent from a year ago, but chief executive Jeff Mezger said inclement weather and labour shortages in some markets had “tempered” deliveries and “ultimately impacted our profitability for the quarter”.Homebuilders came under pressure after the disappointing results and amid a broader market sell-off. DR Horton fell 4 per cent to $28.53, Lennar slid 4 per cent to $43.43, and PulteGroup dropped 4 per cent to $16.22.Meanwhile Walgreens Boots Alliance said its net earnings in the quarter to November 30 had been 30.5 per cent higher than in the same period in 2014. Adjusted earnings per share clocked in at $1.03, handily topping Wall Street estimates of 96 cents.Shares of the pharmacy chain rallied 2 per cent to $81.17, adding to a 12-month rise of 7 per cent.Investors bid up shares of JC Penney. The department store chain said same-store sales had risen 3.9 per cent during the holiday shopping period as unseasonably warm weather weighed on other retailers, such as competitor Macy’s.JC Penney’s shares advanced 3.6 per cent to $7.26.On Thursday the S&P 500 fell 2.4 per cent to 1,943.09, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.3 per cent to 16,514.10, and the Nasdaq Composite lost own 3 per cent to 4,689.43.
53;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2016-01-06T18:13:30Z;The stateless company plays a risky game;Fly-by-night businesses that choose the most convenient home for tax will provoke a backlash;"In 1909 Edward Hall, a vice-president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, lamented in a speech that: “The public does not know us . . . It has never seen us, never met us, does not know where we live.” His words were in response to the Supreme Court having given corporations the legal status of “persons” in 1886, and a chorus of popular complaint that they were soulless.Discontent at the rise of large corporations and trusts in the early 20th century led to the trustbusting presidency of Theodore Roosevelt from 1901 onwards. It also encouraged the growth of corporate welfare: companies such as Cadbury in the UK, Le Bon Marché in France and National Cash Register in the US, which invested in supporting and housing employees.The strongest echo today of Hall is the sense of corporations being rootless and stateless, that no one knows where in the world Facebook, Google or Pfizer live. “Wherever happens to be best for shareholders” seems to be the answer. For US technology companies, that means basing their European arms in low-tax Ireland; for Pfizer, it means merging with Allergan to reincorporate itself in the country.Pfizer will not transport its head office, its primary stock market listing or most of its employees from New York to Dublin following the planned $160bn merger. It will simply shift its place of incorporation to benefit from Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate. The technology companies remain US corporations, with European operations headquartered in Dublin to avoid higher tax rates in other countries.In one sense, the multinationals’ manoeuvres are a rational response to the strange US regime of having a high headline rate of corporate taxation yet allowing companies to shelter their overseas earnings offshore. This is a strong incentive not only to reincorporate through “tax inversion” mergers but to stash $2.1tn, the cash pile of the 300 largest US companies, in tax havens such as Bermuda.It also fits with the stateless attitude of US companies in their own country — nearly half of publicly listed companies incorporate in the small state of Delaware, while most of their head offices remain elsewhere. They do so because of Delaware’s courts, which allow executives plenty of leeway to exercise their judgment.But taking a free and easy attitude to global incorporation, instead of the continental European view that a company has a natural identity — a nationality where its head office sits — raises the same problem that AT&T and others faced in the early 20th century. A rootless corporation feels like a soulless one — an institution that has no loyalty to any particular place.This is a dangerous game to play, as the uproar over both tax inversions and US tech companies paying little corporation tax in countries such as the UK and France has demonstrated. Companies that appear to be fly-by-night and impersonal, picking and choosing which flag is most convenient, are likely to provoke the same backlash as the early 20th century trusts.Walgreens, the US pharmacy chain that considered moving to Switzerland as part of its takeover of Alliance Boots in 2014, was wise to retreat from the idea. It would have looked rather stupid styling itself as “America’s premier pharmacy” and recounting the homespun tale of how “it all started in a town called Dixon, Illinois” while residing for tax purposes in a Swiss canton.Tax inversions and related gymnastics hurt the legitimacy of all multinationals, even those that do not indulge. There is a big difference between a stateless corporation and a cosmopolitan one (although some are both). One uses a convenient legal fiction to shift itself around the world without really moving; the other does the difficult work of expanding beyond national boundaries and transforming itself.A cosmopolitan company is to be admired, even if many are less international than they claim, or appear, to be. Many multinationals employ more non-natives than people from their home country — 169,000 of General Electric’s 305,000 employees, for example, are non-US — yet only 13 per cent of Fortune Global 500 companies have a non-native chief executive.It is hard to forge an international culture, as a few such as ArcelorMittal, the Luxembourg-based steel group, and Nokia, the telecoms equipment group, have tried. Nokia was formed from Finnish and German companies (Nokia and Siemens Networks) and is now absorbing a French-American company (Alcatel-Lucent). Rajeev Suri, its chief executive, is Indian.While such companies remake their businesses, those that incorporate financially merely preserve more cash for shareholders by reducing tax liabilities. At best, it does nothing for the company itself; at worst, it damages its standing with customers and governments everywhere it operates — the country it came from, its adopted tax home and other territories.A multinational can be a solid corporate citizen in more than one country. It can contribute to society even if its head office is elsewhere. But treating its nationality as contingent makes that harder — it instead gives the impression of not being rooted at all. That might be a good deal for the shareholders in the short term but it carries a heavy long-term price.john.gapper@ft.com"
54;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Valeant reports sales and profits plunge;Drugmaker’s shares rise after Walgreens deal helps rebuild credibility;Valeant said sales and profits had plummeted during the final three months of the year and cut its earnings guidance for 2016, as the Canadian drugmaker insisted it would recover from a months-long crisis that has wiped more than $50bn from its market value.Shares in Valeant, which jumped 16 per cent on Tuesday after it signed a drug distribution deal with Walgreens, were up a further 8 per cent in morning trading in New York on Wednesday. Investors interpreted the agreement with the largest US pharmacy chain as sign of confidence in the drugmaker.The cut to the earnings forecast for 2016 was also less severe than some analysts had expected, fuelling hopes that Valeant is back on the front foot after months of negative publicity.Valeant was plunged into chaos in October when it was pulled the plug on Philidor, a chain of mail-order pharmacies under its control, after short sellers alleged the group was committing fraud to boost sales of Valeant’s dermatology products.Valeant dismissed the allegation as false but still severed ties with Philidor, leaving it to fill a large number of prescriptions free during the fourth quarter. At the same time, a political outcry over the prices of some of its drugs prompted the company to discount some of its most expensive drugs.Revenues for the fourth quarter will now be about $2.75bn against its previous forecast of about $3.35bn, and adjusted earnings per share will be about $2.60 versus $4.10.Mike Pearson, chief executive, struck an upbeat tone at an investor meeting in Newark, New Jersey on Wednesday. He dispensed with the apologies he had offered shareholders in recent weeks and attacked the short sellers who set their sights on the company.Mr Pearson touted the agreement with Walgreens as “much better than Philidor”. The pharmacy chain will distribute Valeant’s products through 8,000 of its stores and manage voucher programmes to help patients cope with the cost of their medicines.He thanked Stefano Pessina, chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance, for signing the deal. He described the Italian executive as a “great man” and conceded Valeant “wasn’t the easiest company to partner with given all the negative press”.Valeant said the Walgreens deal had resulted in a one-off hit of $150m to its fourth-quarter revenues, primarily due to changes to the way it accounts for inventory. Discounting some of its most expensive drugs would result in a further hit of $200m, while the impact of winding down Philidor and giving away medicines would be $250m.Next year, the company expects full-year adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to be about $7bn against its previous forecast for an ebitda “floor” of $7.5bn, which implied there was a high chance the company would beat the target.The company said the cost of rebuilding its dermatology business would be $225m next year, while lower prices had wiped about $125m from its previous earnings target. It also expects to spend an extra $75m on legal fees in 2016 as it completes an internal probe into Philidor and contends with numerous investigations by the US authorities.Mr Pearson said the company would spend about $75m on bonuses next year to stop an exodus of staff. “It’s a great, great retention programme — it’s going to cost us a lot but it’s worth it,” he added, noting the loss of only two staff since the Philidor scandal broke.Valeant, which has taken on $31bn of debt to fund a string of acquisitions in recent years, said it would eschew deals next year to focus on lowering its debt, said Robert Rosiello, chief financial officer. The target was to reduce it to below four times ebitda by the end of 2016, he said.“We are going to hoard our cash and focus the vast majority on our debt pay down,” said Mr Rosiello, who also pledged to improve the transparency of the company’s financial reporting, a point of contention for many investors. From now on it will report its cash flow on a GAAP basis, while also breaking out sales for its top 30 products.Analysts have said the deal with Walgreens should help restore the company’s credibility. “We believe the agreement demonstrates that pharmacies, and therefore payers, are willing to work with Valeant, nullifying a big portion of the current bear thesis that Valeant would struggle to find a distribution replacement post the Philidor allegations,” said Shibani Malhotra, an analyst at Nomura.
55;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2015-10-30T15:47:20Z;Thoughtful Italian deal maker who plays the long game;Stefano Pessina, the Walgreens Boots Alliance chief, is known for choosing his moment to strike;Stefano Pessina has struck dozens of deals during his 40-year career. But unlike a gung-ho corporate raider, the 74-year-old chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance has played the long game, getting to know potential partners and targets, and waiting for the right moment to strike.This week was no different. Walgreens announced the purchase of Rite Aid for $17.2bn, alighting on the rival chain during a period of consolidation in the US pharmacy industry.Richard Baker, the former chief executive of Boots, says this is typical of Mr Pessina’s style. During Mr Baker’s first week at the helm, Sir Nigel Rudd, Boots chairman suggested he meet Mr Pessina, and they had lunch. The two kept in touch, and four years later they agreed to merge Boots with Mr Pessina’s Alliance UniChem.“People think he’s a ruthless deal maker. I think that misrepresents him,” says Mr Baker. “He’s actually a very thoughtful and strategic businessman, who has grown his company through careful long-term strategic thinking.”Mr Pessina’s path could have been different. The Italian businessman, identifiable by his white hair and sharp suits, was born to a well-to-do Milanese family and studied nuclear physics.But rather than pursuing a career in that field, he took on part of his family’s eclectic business interests. While his relatives supplied textiles to Milan’s fashion houses, Mr Pessina set about constructing a wholesale drugs distribution chain, initially in Italy and, by the turn of the millennium, spanning Europe.It was through this business — and his hunt for deals — that he met his long-time partner, the glamorous Italian businesswoman Ornella Barra.They met when she was seeking a partner for her pharmaceuticals wholesaling chain in northern Italy. Mr Pessina’s business in the south of Italy was eventually combined with Ms Barra’s. They have been a couple for almost 30 years but have not married.She has been a powerful figure in executing Mr Pessina’s plans, and today runs Walgreens’ pharmaceuticals wholesaling business. “It’s more than one marriage,” Ms Barra has said of their personal and business relationships.In 2006 Mr Pessina came to the attention of the British business community, when Alliance UniChem sealed the deal with Boots, one of Britain’s best-known high street chains. A year later he and KKR took Alliance Boots private in a £12.4bn deal. The acquisition was Europe’s biggest buyout at the time.In 2012 Mr Pessina pulled off a masterstroke: persuading Walgreens to buy Alliance Boots for £10bn.“He is different to almost every other business person I have met,” says Andrew Bracey, the former finance director of Ocado. “He doesn’t think purely about the economics. He thinks in concepts . . . in the long term. ‘If I take this business and I do this with it, what is the potential outcome?’ That could be two months away. But it’s more likely to be 10 years away.”As well as building an empire, Mr Pessina’s master plan has made him rich. He made about £500m from the original buyout of Boots — although he and KKR did not take a dividend while it was in their ownership.He has an economic interest over 137.5m Walgreens shares, worth about $11.5bn, from an original investment of $2.5bn.He is different to almost every other business person I have met. He thinks in concepts . . . in the long termCharming and unafraid of putting forward forthright views — for example on the UK tax climate and prospects under a Labour government — he has not escaped controversy during his long career.He closed the Boots final-salary pension schemes to existing members and cut jobs. He then moved the domicile of Alliance Boots to the low-tax region of Zug in Switzerland, courting scrutiny of its tax affairs.At an age when many executives are contemplating spending more time on the golf course, Mr Pessina, who is based in Monaco, does not rule out further deals.Asked whether Rite Aid would be the final piece of the jigsaw, he says: “There will be some additional opportunities. I am sure the market will give opportunities. Now it depends whether I will be able to catch them or not.”From his record, it is likely that he will.
56;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2015-10-28T20:10:44Z;Walgreens’ $17.2bn bid for Rite Aid faces regulatory hurdles;Stefano Pessina’s US ambitions reflect industry hopes that consolidation can offset price pressures;"Stefano Pessina, the Italian chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance, has made his name — and fortune — sealing pharmacy deals across the globe.His latest move, to buy Walgreens’ smaller US rival Rite Aid for $17.2bn including debt, is unlikely to be his last, he says in an interview, as he pursues his ambition of creating a dominant pharmacy and drug wholesaling company that spans several continents.Walgreens already has 13,200 stores in 11 countries. “There will be some additional opportunities,” says the billionaire septuagenarian. “I’m sure the market will present opportunities. Now it depends whether I will be able to catch them or not.”Yet before he can look to any further deals in the US he must first get the Rite Aid acquisition past competition regulators.Mr Pessina had made no secret of his desire to secure a US deal at a time when he sees the healthcare industry in the world’s largest economy as one undergoing tremendous upheaval.“There is a wave of consolidation because margins are lower and people have to find additional ways to compensate for loss of profit, particularly in the US where the market is not particularly rational [and is] high priced. If squeezed, people have to find ways to survive,” he said on Wednesday.The high price of drugs in the US coupled with the intensifying push from Washington to reduce costs in a bloated industry has hurt margins and triggered consolidation throughout the supply chain: from drug manufacturers to insurers and drugstore chains like Walgreens.“Smart acquirers have used consolidation to drive efficiencies into the system while lowering costs and improving returns,” says Ross Muken, an analyst at Evercore ISI.CVS Health agreed in June to buy Target’s pharmacy business for $1.9bn, and Walgreens — before it completed its purchase of Boots Alliance last year — bought domestic drugstore Bioscrip, a specialty and mail-order pharmacy, in 2012.That was just one year after Walgreens acquired the Duane Reade drugstore chain. It also entered the distribution business in 2013, buying a stake in AmerisourceBergen and signing a decade-long brand and distribution deal with the company.The shake-up is highlighted by data showing merger and acquisition activity across the US healthcare industry is already at a record $447.8bn in the year to date, higher than any previous full year of announced deals, according to Dealogic. Pharmacy deals alone have reached $19bn this year, by far the biggest amount on record.We will see what the regulators will say; it depends very much on them. Whatever we think could be wrongWalgreens’ Rite Aid offer is the latest deal driven by pressure on margins in the industry. The tie-up would generate $1bn in cost synergies, it reckons, in areas such as procurement. But it also it intends to invest in improving Rite Aid’s stores, which analysts say is much needed.“The key will be revamping Rite Aid stores and footprint which has been underinvested in for many years, and driving [its] beauty [and] private label [products],” Evercore’s Mr Muken says.Some bankers and lawyers, who are not directly involved in the deal, say that antitrust obstacles will be substantial as combining the companies will create a de facto duopoly in the US, between Walgreens and CVS.Analysts have also raised some concerns, but so far have only suggested that a sale of some drugstores might be required in regions on the east and west coasts, where the two companies overlap. Some note that the market is already “highly competitive”. They add that pharmacy benefit managers — the companies that reimburse pharmacies for dispensing prescriptions — are already consolidating and have been pushing down the level of reimbursements drugstore chains have been receiving.Mr Pessina is reluctant to be drawn on the issue of regulatory approval. Asked whether he expects to have to sell some stores he says: “This is the public wisdom. We will see what the regulators will say; it depends very much on them. Whatever we think could be wrong.”Walgreens and Rite Aid would control 22 per cent of revenues from prescriptions, compared with 23.7 per cent for CVS, according to Pembroke Consulting.The remainder of the industry is made up of many smaller players, such as Express Scripts, which has a mail-order pharmacy business as well as being a pharmacy benefit manager, with market shares ranging from 12.4 per cent to as little as 0.5 per cent.Despite this fragmentation, Mr Pessina does not expect more merger activity between pharmacies. His view suggests that further consolidation could instead focus on deals between different types of companies within the supply chain.Walgreens’ investors initially welcomed the proposed acquisition, sending shares sharply higher when it was first reported on Tuesday. But on Wednesday the stock fell 11 per cent to $84.95, below where it started the week, after the company said it was suspending share buybacks to help fund the Rite Aid deal.The company is also using debt to fund the purchase. This prompted Moody’s to put Walgreens’ credit rating on review for a downgrade, highlighting the speed at which it was making another acquisition, not even a year before it closed the deal with Boots.If Mr Pessina’s future is anything like his past, however, investors may not have to wait too long for the next deal to come along."
57;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Walgreens to buy Rite Aid for $17.2bn;Stefano Pessina seeks to create global pharmacy chain;Walgreens Boots Alliance, the US’s second-largest pharmacy chain by sales, has agreed to buy smaller rival Rite Aid for $17.2bn including debt, in the latest move by billionaire chief executive Stefano Pessina to build a global drugstore group.Walgreens will pay $9 in cash for each Rite Aid share, representing a 48 per cent premium to Monday’s closing price, the companies said in a statement. At the offer price, Rite Aid has an equity value of $9.45bn with net debt of $7.75bn.Earlier news of the talks had sent shares in Rite Aid up 43 per cent to $8.67 in New York. However, in after-hours trading the shares were down 7.7 per cent at $8 as bankers cautioned the deal could face regulatory hurdles. Walgreens Boots shares closed 6.4 per cent higher at $95.16 before falling slightly in after-hours trading.Rite Aid has 4,561 pharmacies concentrated mainly on the east and west coasts, compared with Walgreens’ 8,232, though it is closing around 200. The footprint of the combined company could raise competition issues, which could force divestitures at some locations, analysts said.A deal will help Walgreens expand in regions where it has less of a presence such as the northeast US. It could make it the largest purchaser of branded and generic drugs globally, giving it a “huge cost advantage”, said Vishnu Lekraj, a senior healthcare analyst at Morningstar.Mr Pessina said the deal was “another step” in its global strategy. “Our complementary retail pharmacy footprints in the US will create an even better network, with more health and wellness solutions available in stores and online.”Walgreens said it expected to realise cost savings of more than $1bn from the deal. “The transaction is expected to be accretive to Walgreens Boots Alliance’s adjusted earnings per share in its first full year after completion,” the company said.The companies will initially operate as separate entities but will be integrated over time.Mr Pessina, 74, who was named chief executive of Walgreens Boots in July after spending seven months as its acting chief, leads the company’s dealmaking strategy. He engineered the combination of Boots of the UK and Walgreens, and speculation had been rife that he would continue to look for more acquisitions.Pessina’s Rite Aid purchase furthers ambitions to dominate healthcareRead moreThe healthcare industry— from drug companies to insurers and pharmacy chains — has gone through a wave of consolidation, amid the expansion of government-supported healthcare access under Obamacare. The reform includes provisions aimed at driving down costs, and aims to broaden access to healthcare for some of the country’s poorest.Mr Pessina told investors this year that the American industry was “ready for another round” as he expected Washington to “exert their power” to squeeze costs, which would dent profit margins.“Everyone is trying to get bigger and better” to try to leverage scale and improve pricing power with suppliers, Mr Lekraj said, referring to the healthcare industry as a whole.He added that the deal could also help Walgreens incrementally when it comes to negotiating reimbursement rates with so-called pharmacy benefit managers. These act as intermediaries between drug companies and insurers.Mr Pessina’s move to take over Rite Aid, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, would return Walgreens to its status as the biggest drugstore chain in the US, topping CVS Health, which has also grown recently through acquisitions.The deal would also give Mr Pessina and Walgreens access to Rite Aid’s heath insurance business, something he had been keen to acquire.CVS has 7,000 pharmacies and more than 1,000 walk-in medical clinics.UBS acted as Walgreens’ adviser, while Citi acted for Rite Aid.
58;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2015-10-27T19:07:50Z;Veteran Italian dealmaker Stefano Pessina extends US reach;Pessina’s Rite Aid purchase furthers ambitions to dominate healthcare;Adding Rite Aid to the Walgreens Boots Alliance stable is the latest building block in Stefano Pessina’s plans to dominate global healthcare retailing and pharmaceuticals distribution.The 74-year-old executive, known for his white hair, smart suits, thick Italian accent and forthright point of view, has spent the last decade pulling off a series of megadeals.“He combines a very sharp intellect with an acute business sense and impeccable manners,” says Samuel Johar, chairman of headhunter Buchanan Harvey.Born to a well-to-do Milanese family, Mr Pessina trained as a nuclear physicist before taking on part of his family’s eclectic business interests. While other family members supplied textiles to Milan’s fashion houses, Mr Pessina set about constructing a wholesale pharmaceuticals distribution chain, initially in Italy, but spanning Europe by the turn of the millennium.It was through this business — and his hunt for deals — that he met his long-time partner, Italian businesswoman Ornella Barra. The glamorous Ms Barra still runs Alliance Boots’ pharmaceuticals wholesale division. Mr Pessina originally combined his pharmaceuticals wholesale business in the south of Italy with Ms Barra’s in the north.Together they acquired a series of companies in France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Morocco to create Alliance Santé.More transformational deals followed. In 1997, Alliance Santé merged with UniChem to create Alliance UniChem. Nine years later, Alliance UniChem sealed a deal with Boots, one of Britain’s best-known high street chains. In 2007, Mr Pessina and KKR took Alliance Boots private in a £12.4bn deal. The acquisition was at the time Europe’s biggest buyout.But Mr Pessina had long eyed a presence in the US, and in 2012, he was able to break into the market, when he and KKR struck a deal with Walgreens to eventually sell Alliance Boots to the US giant for about £10bn.The agreement was structured in two parts, and just over a year ago, Walgreens Alliance Boots sealed the second stage of the transaction, when Walgreens paid £9bn in a cash-and-share offer for the 55 per cent of Alliance Boots it did not already own.Although Mr Pessina sold Alliance Boots to Walgreens, there was no doubt he was the driving force within the company. He was initially executive vice-chairman and acting chief executive, and was confirmed as chief executive in July.Other executives at his stage of life and fortune would be content with having created a global health retailing and pharmaceutical company.But Mr Pessina, who lives in Monaco, was keen to add another strand — US health benefits — to his empire.As well as the Rite Aid stores, the company has a health benefits business that Walgreens will be able to roll out to its customers.And there could be more deals to come. He has often referred to creating a sizeable business in China as the final piece of the jigsaw.“He’s on good form,” says Mr Johar. “He lives for his work and he thoroughly enjoys it.”
59;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2015-08-26T17:21:28Z;Groups race to offload pension liabilities with insurer megadeals;New financial safety standards threaten to push up costs of schemes;Companies are racing to do megadeals with insurers to offload their pension scheme obligations, as a looming overhaul of financial safety standards threatens to push up the costs, consultants have cautioned.Advisers at PwC warned companies face having to pay as much as 10 per cent more to transfer their final salary scheme liabilities when new regulations for insurers kick in next year.The warning is a sign of how the EU’s forthcoming Solvency II capital requirements could have implications beyond the insurance industry — with potential knock-on effects for business and consumers.“There’s lots of paddling to try and get there quicker,” said Jerome Melcer, PwC pensions director. “I’d expect there to be a surge in deals towards the end of this calendar year.”Others in the industry questioned the forecast. Clive Wellsteed, partner at Lane Clark & Peacock, said it was too early to say what the impact on pricing would be, but did not expect rises to be any greater than 3 per cent.Pharmaceuticals group GlaxoSmithKline, retailer Alliance Boots and music business EMI are among the companies to have struck “bulk annuity” deals, which relieve them of pension headaches in return for a premium.The insurance industry took on £13bn worth of defined benefit retirement liabilities in 2014 and another £5bn so far this year.Insurers want do more of the bulk deals, especially after UK chancellor George Osborne’s new pension freedoms have caused sales of lucrative individual annuities — sold to savers in defined contribution schemes — to collapse.But Solvency II, a complex set of risk-based requirements designed to better match insurers’ assets and liabilities, presents a potential barrier.Most big insurers have said the new regime, which begins in January, should be manageable for their businesses overall and UK regulators have sought to reassure the sector about the impact.Sam Woods, the Prudential Regulation Authority’s director of insurance supervision, said in a speech last month that the watchdog had no plan to use the new rules to force the industry to raise capital.Even so, consultants cautioned that bulk annuities were among the particular lines of insurance business that could be hit, partly because the obligations run so far into the future.To satisfy regulators under Solvency II, insurers may need to set aside more funds to back bulk annuity liabilities, said Mr Melcer, adding the industry was likely to pass on the costs to companies through higher premiums.He said the expected price rise would most affect deals known as full buyouts, which involve pension schemes with large numbers of members still in work.Such transactions present greater uncertainty for insurers than those that involve scheme members who have already retired. Bigger risks mean higher capital requirements under Solvency II.As a result of “grandfathering” concessions from Brussels, insurance policies that are written in January will enjoy considerable relief from the new requirements.Still, Mr Melcer cautioned that negotiators may struggle to rush the deals through. Bulk annuity transactions are complex and typically take several months to arrange.Mr Wellsteed said that companies already in talks with insurers would be “well advised” to try to get the deals done before the end of the year. However, he added he had “not seen much evidence” that companies not already in negotiations were accelerating the process because of Solvency II.
60;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2015-08-04T16:35:57Z;CVS Health dips on retail setback;US stocks slip on call for September rate rise;CVS Health shares weakened on Tuesday after the US drugstore chain warned sales growth in its retail stores had cooled and narrowed its earnings outlook for the remainder of the year.The US pharmacy group said same-store sales, a closely scrutinised metric of underlying growth, rose 0.5 per cent in the quarter, down from a 1.2 per cent gain in the first three months of the year.Net profits in the quarter rose 2 per cent from a year earlier to $1.3bn, or $1.12 per share, on a 7 per cent rise in revenues to $37.2bn.CVS, which also manages pharmacy benefits and the fulfilment of prescriptions on behalf of large insurers and employers, said it expected adjusted earnings to range between $5.11 and $5.18 a share, compared with a previous outlook for $5.08 to $5.19 a share.Analysts on Wall Street expect the company to report full-year results of $5.17 a share.John Heinbockel, an analyst with Guggenheim Securities, said pressures on the company’s gross margins nonetheless did not “call secular growth into question”.“We view CVS Health as the rare large consumer company that can generate 10 per cent secular earnings before interest and taxes growth, driven by strong underlying growth,” he said.Shares of the company fell 3 per cent to $108.81 in midday trading, wiping more than $4bn off the company’s valuation. CVS Health recovered later in the trading day to close at $109.96. Rival Walgreens Boots Alliance fell 0.25 per cent to close at $95.67.Apple shares fell another 3.2 per cent on Tuesday, compounding a fall of 2.5 per cent the previous day, on investor concerns about its growth in China. Shares closed at $114.64 compared with their pre-earnings high of $133 two weeks ago.Shares of Coach, the entry-level US accessories maker, climbed 3.2 per cent to close at $31.41 after the company said it expected sales at its namesake brand to grow in its current fiscal year.Revenues in its fourth quarter, which ran to June 27, slipped 12 per cent from a year earlier to $1bn, while profits tumbled 84 per cent to $11.7m, or 4 cents a share.Analysts on Wall Street had expected the handbag maker to report a profit of $67.5m on sales of $973m.Time Inc advanced 2.6 per cent to $22.43 after cost cuts helped the magazine publisher swing to a profit in its latest quarter.The company, which owns the People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune titles, said sales fell 6 per cent from a year earlier to $773m, ahead of consensus forecasts. The group swung to a profit of $24m, or 22 cents a share, from a loss of $32m a year ago.Baxalta, the Illinois-based biotech recently spun off from Baxter, gained nearly 12 per cent to close at $37.10 after UK-listed, Dublin-based Shire made an approach to take over the maker of treatments for haemophilia and other bleeding disorders.TriNet shares tumbled almost 39 per cent to $16.33 after the provider of human resources services to small- and midsized businesses swung to a surprise net loss in its latest quarter.The group said it lost $1.3m, or 2 cents a share, in the three months to the end of June. Analysts on Wall Street had expected the company to report a profit of $10.1m.TriNet blamed a “higher than expected number of large medical claims” for the loss.Overall, US equity markets slipped after Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said it was “appropriate” for the US central bank to raise rates in September, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.The S&P 500 slipped 0.22 per cent to close at 2,093.32 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.27 per cent to close at 17,550.69.

61;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2015-06-29T16:29:41Z;Private equity sees shades of 2007 — and sells;Leveraged buyouts have been absent, but exits hit a record level;If 2015 is turning out to be the hottest year for mergers and acquisitions since 2007, and buyers are back with a vengeance, then no one told private equity.Leveraged buyouts have been conspicuously absent from lists of 2015’s biggest deals to date. Here, at least, history is not repeating itself.Back in the heady first half of 2007, private equity was toasting the first buyout of a FTSE 100 company, when KKR launched its £12.4bn acquisition of Alliance Boots.In the same period this year, the UK’s biggest buyout was New Look – the fashion chain sold by existing private equity owners Apax and Permira to Brait, a South African investment company. Valued at £1.9bn, this was the only billion-pound buyout in Britain since 2012.“It is a similar situation to 2007, but without the same level of dealflow,” says Charles Ind, managing partner at Bowmark Capital, a firm focused on small UK buyouts.Data from Thomson Reuters back Mr Ind up. Private equity has accounted for only 6 per cent of M&A in the past six months.Buyout volume has fallen by nearly a tenth compared with the same period last year, to a little over $120bn.This is despite – or because of – an abundance of cheap debt funding for acquirers and record amounts raised by buyout funds.Buyout executives have often found themselves unwilling to pay increasingly double-digit multiples of earnings for assets, as this leaves little headroom for them to increase valuations further.They have also struggled against rival corporate acquirers, and the stock market’s embrace of initial public offerings.Instead, private equity has used aspects of 2015’s rerun of 2007 to sell or list their existing assets at record pace.In Europe so far this year, the value of private equity exits totalled €72.9bn, trouncing 2007’s first-half record of €68.7bn, according to data compiled by the Centre for Management Buyout Research, sponsored by UK buyout group Equistone.CMBOR also notes that 11 of the 20 biggest exits have involved investments less than 5 years old – suggesting this is not simply a clear out of pre-crisis assets.Private equity’s $120bn of buyout deals so far in 2015 also pales in comparison with amount of capital sitting in funds as ‘dry powder’, yet to be invested.At $450bn (or $1.2 trillion when other kinds of private equity investing are included), this dry powder has also surpassed 2007 levels, says UBS.Such a stubbornly high level of uninvested capital may reflect a reluctance on the part of buyout fund managers to do deals at the top of the market.Investors in private equity, meanwhile, appear more interested in backing smaller mid-market buyouts where prices are lower – via funds such as Bowmark’s or Equistone’s – or investing directly in large deals themselves.In one of the year’s bigger buyouts, the $4.6bn acquisition of cloud-data provider Informatica in April, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board partnered with a Permira.Then, this month, CPPIB alone bought GE Capital’s buyout lending arm for $12bn.In another eight years’ time, this preference for ‘direct’ investment may prove to be the 2015 trend that revealed most about private equity’s future.
62;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2015-06-08T14:46:45Z;Boots cuts jobs in shift to digital sales;High street pharmacy chain says 700 ‘non-store’ roles are at risk;Boots is cutting 700 jobs in the UK as part of an overhaul aimed at focusing its health and beauty business on higher-growth areas, such as digital sales.On Monday, the high street group — which is part of the Nasdaq-listed pharmacy and health giant Walgreens Boots Alliance — said the roles at risk are “non-store”.Staff are yet to be informed of the details of the restructuring but a spokesman said the majority of the job cuts — around 400 — will come from Boots’ UK head office in Nottingham, which currently employs 4,000 people in finance, marketing, trading and human resources functions.Additional cuts will come from what the company describes as “field” roles — managers travelling out to various stores around the UK. Boots has more than 2,500 UK health and beauty outlets and more than 630 branches of Boots Opticians.It said it hoped to achieve the job cuts through “a combination of natural attrition, redeployment, retraining and redundancy” — adding that it will be creating new roles in areas such as digital sales and IT.Boots’ proposed job cuts are part of an overhaul designed to modernise the retailer, which can trace its history back to 1849, when agricultural worker John Boot opened a small store in Nottingham.Under the plans, the company will attempt to improve sales in new areas such as its “order and collect” — a service that allows orders made online by 6pm to be collected in store from midday the next day. A Boots spokesman said the company was also looking at how it could benefit from fast-growing product lines such as “wearable technology”, by attracting customers keen to keep track of their health and fitness.Simon Roberts, president of Boots, said: “While we have continued to deliver a solid performance in recent years, despite challenging market conditions, we cannot be complacent and must be stronger and more agile going forward, to meet the fast changing expectations of our customers.”News of the restructuring follows Walgreens’ move last year to buy the remaining 55 per cent of Alliance Boots that it did not already own, having acquired a majority stake in 2012.In its most recent trading update, in April, Walgreens Boots Alliance reported a 2.9 per cent increase in same-store sales in January and February at its “retail pharmacy international” division, which includes Boots stores in countries ranging from the UK to Thailand.

The value of global mergers and acquisitions hit $3.34tn last year, up 47 per cent, to its highest level since the financial crisis.Independent investment banks, which focus mainly on advising clients on deals rather than cross selling other financial products, have grown rapidly since the financial crisis, winning market share from the so-called bulge bracket.In 2014 independents like Lazard, Evercore and Centerview controlled 28 per cent of the advisory market, nearly double compared to 2007. Meanwhile, the market share of bulge bracket players fell to 61 per cent from 76 per cent before the crisis.Dealogic estimates that Goldman generated just over $2bn in M&A advisory in 2014 compared to $1.7bn at JPMorgan.Lazard has worked on some of the largest deals of 2014, including AT&T’s $67bn acquisition of DirectTV, Walgreens’ $37bn purchase of its remaining stake in Alliance Boots and the $27.4bn four-way transaction between Lorillard, Reynolds American, Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco.“The strong results reflect the power of our global franchise . . . excelling in providing real local expertise with a global prospective,” Ken Jacobs told the Financial Times. “There are very few firms in the world that can do [this]. There may have been more before the crisis but there are very few left and I think that’s the distinction for Lazard today.”Lazard’s shares rose 4 per cent by close of trading in New York after it announced its annual and fourth-quarter results.Mr Jacobs refrained from giving an outlook for 2015 but Lazard has had a strong start to the new year advising on three mega deals, including Pfizer’s $17bn acquisition of Hospira, the US pharmaceutical company’s first large transaction since it failed to buy the UK’s AstraZeneca last year.Lazard reported stronger-than-expected earnings for the quarter ended December on the back of the deal frenzy as well as record revenues at its asset management unit.Net income of $172m, or $1.29 per share, was up 57 per cent from the year earlier quarter. Annual earnings hit an all-time high at $427m, or $3.20 per share, up from $160m, or $1.21 per share.Revenues at Lazard’s financial advisory business, which includes M&A, restructuring and shareholder activism, rose 14 per cent to $359m in the quarter. Meanwhile, revenues at the bank’s asset management business, which accounts for about half of the total, was down 3 per cent to $283m. Assets under management were up 5 per cent to $197bn by the end of December compared to a year ago.Advisory to governments is also becoming an important part of Lazard’s business. It was recently hired by Greece’s new leftwing government to advise it on its debt burden.Lazard’s pre-tax margin for the year was 25.5 per cent, above the goal set by the company’s management in 2012, driven mainly by revenue growth.“Upside versus our expectations was driven by record quarterly advisory revenues, expense control and a lower tax rate,” said Ashley Serrao, an analyst at Credit Suisse who tracks independent investment banks.

Well, the Bible is only 1,000 pages. How many tax systems are only 1,000 pages? They are several hundred times that,” he told the BBC.Wednesday night’s speech follows the publication of a recent book that blamed the coalition government’s welfare cuts and “poverty wages” for a rise in income inequality.On Rock or Sand? Firm Foundations for Britain’s Future, was edited by John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York, and includes a long contribution by Archbishop Welby on the fact that cities outside London have been “cast aside” leaving the poorest in a “vicious circle of decline”.

These began with claims by Stefano Pessina, chief executive of Boots, that an Ed Miliband government would be “a catastrophe”.Mr Umunna tried to calm the row, insisting that Labour was “not spoiling for a fight with any particular business person”. But he said it was not in a company’s interest if its boss did not “engage with us in a fair fashion”.He told the Financial Times: “I’m not sure it’s in the shareholders’ best interests, or the board’s, where they don’t have a good constructive relationship with a prospective party of government.”The shadow business secretary said party political interventions by company chiefs got in the way of engagement with ministers on business-friendly policies. Mr Umunna added that he was “definitely not” threatening revenge.Despite Labour’s confrontational tone towards its business critics this week, the party has conducted a charm offensive behind the scenes in the City of London, conscious that its anti-business reputation could backfire on election day.Ed Miliband’s close adviser Lord Wood hosted a lunch this week attended by City institutions and organised by the CityUK lobby group at JPMorgan’s Blackfriars offices. Another dinner, organised by the same group late last year and hosted by Mr Miliband himself was attended by more than 20 City bosses, including Michael Spencer, the former Conservative party treasurer who heads brokerage firm ICAP.Labour also hopes to contain the row with business by saying this week’s critics are either ill-placed to lecture Mr Miliband — Mr Pessina lives in Monaco and moved Alliance Boots to low-tax Switzerland — or are Tory sympathisers.The party pointed out that Stuart Rose, the former Marks and Spencer chief executive who accused Mr Miliband of being a “1970s throwback” is now a Conservative peer.Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman elect of engineering group Meggitt, said Labour’s attacks on Mr Pessina “stifled debate” and “made people think twice” about voicing their opinions: he is a Tory donor.Mr Umunna believes that business leaders who become Tory peers must expect to be challenged but says most FTSE 100 chief executives will keep off the party political stage before the May election.The UK’s main political parties are facing the prospect of a close and unpredictable national poll on May 7 as they struggle to address the march of the populists

Further readingLabour officials admit the party is unlikely to receive the public endorsement of any FTSE 100 chief executive but argue that neither did Tony Blair before his 1997 election victory.Tensions are clear, however. One Labour official said: “What many people in the business community object to is nothing to do with their business but to do with our proposed mansion tax and a 50p top rate of tax.”One business figure with good Tory contacts said Lord Feldman, the Conservative chairman and fundraiser, would try to persuade high-profile business people to speak out for David Cameron as polling day approached.But on Tuesday, many company bosses were studiously staying out of politics. Tim Steiner, chief executive of Ocado, said: “Whether we end up with a coalition, Labour government or Conservative government, or anything else there may be — Greens or Ukip — people in the UK still carry on eating food.”Asked whether he was concerned about a Labour election victory, Bob Dudley, BP chief executive, said: “I must admit I’ve been really focused on $50 oil, which has been our big issue.”Additional reporting by Elizabeth Rigby, Andrea Felsted and Christopher Adams"
66;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2015-02-03T20:10:48Z;Labour counts on popular opinion in taking tough tone;Focus on cost of living, rising inequality and tax avoidance finds favour among public;"The war of words this week between Labour and business is a far cry from the mid-1990s when Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson led a “prawn cocktail offensive” of social engagements to persuade business chiefs that a Labour government posed them no threat.Senior Labour politicians remained defiant on Tuesday after three days of argument with senior business figures. Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, warned that outspoken attacks on the party were “not in the shareholders’ best interests”.The reason? Ed Miliband, Labour leader, believes that today’s voters are more concerned with rising inequality, the “cost of living crisis” and tax avoidance than they are with the siren warnings from some of Britain’s boardrooms.The polls suggest he is probably right. A survey last year by Populus found that 61 per cent of voters wanted the next election winner to be “tough on big business” and 68 per cent felt it was good that parties were campaigning to change the way business operated. Labour’s proposed new tax on expensive homes is one of the party’s most popular policies.One of Mr Miliband’s aides insisted that the warmth between Labour and business under Tony Blair had been exaggerated, claiming that there were no letters of support from FTSE 100 chief executives in the run-up to the 1997 election: “There wasn’t a time that lions slept with sheep, when business was in thrall to Labour”, he said.At the shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday no front bench Labour MPs spoke up to criticise the party’s stance.Yet some Labour figures are concerned, including Lord Mandelson, who recently warned that his party was failing to provide an “explanation of how we’re going to bring about economic growth.” The peer now runs a consultancy advising big business.Mr Miliband’s team feel lucky that it was Boots boss Stefano Pessina who prompted the current row by warning at the weekend that a Labour government would be a catastrophe. Mr Pessina, a billionaire based in Monaco, did not criticise any particular party policy, they point out.Paul Myners, former Labour City minister, said the party needed to improve its links with the business world. “‘Rich non-dom businessman criticises Labour’ is hardly a story,” Lord Myners told the FT.“But Labour does need to work harder on its communications with business, including underlining its commitment to Europe.”Labour sees its commitment not to have a referendum on EU membership as a trump card in maintaining the ear of business — if not its love.Mr Pessina, ironically, said that the one policy he most feared was Britain leaving the EU.Labour figures hope that by coming out against the Boots boss so vociferously they will deter other potential critics.That has led to accusations that the party is behaving like the SNP, which sought to intimidate business critics in the lead-up to the Scottish referendum.One City figure said Labour’s reaction to the Pessina comments was likely to make business leaders think twice about criticising politicians: “I wouldn’t imagine it will encourage many others to come out vocally,” he said.John Longworth, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that business leaders had a legitimate voice that should be heard.Richard Caring, a tycoon who lent money to Labour a decade ago — but switched allegiances to the Tories in 2010 — said mr Miliband’s stance could deter investment in the UK.“The beating up of the industrialists or the bosses of the companies, the investors in this country, is a cheap, vote-catching typical Miliband-type move,” he said. “Labour party policy is to get elected and we don’t give a damn about anything else.”Mr Caring, who owns restaurants and clubs, is non-domiciled in the UK for tax purposes.The BCC commissioned research last autumn after John Redwood, the former Tory minister, appeared to threaten businesses which opposed Britain pulling out of the European Union. “Our research showed that 72 per cent of the public believe that business should have a voice,” he said.As well as Europe, Labour still hopes to win some support in business circles for its plans for skills and long-term infrastructure.Ed Balls, shadow chancellor, told a business audience at the Institute of Civil Engineers in Westminster that there would always be disagreements in any society about how much tax should be paid.“There will be some ideological Labour-supporting businessmen and Tory-supporting businesspeople who take a Conservative view, and they may even end up as Conservative peers,” he said.“But most businesspeople don’t take a Labour or Conservative view, they take a company view — what’s the best thing for the country over the next 30 years to create and support jobs growth.”Mr Balls vowed that a Labour government would set up an independent infrastructure commission to make decisions about big projects such as aviation or energy schemes.However, asked to name a senior business supporter on Tuesday night’s edition of Newsnight on BBC2, Ed Balls struggled to recall the surname of Bill Thomas, former head of EDS who chaired a small-business task force for Labour: “Bill,” he said.The UK’s main political parties are facing the prospect of a close and unpredictable national poll on May 7 as they struggle to address the march of the populists

Further readingKatja Hall, deputy director-general of the CBI, said businesspeople should not be denied the right to join the public debate. But she emphasised that her organisation was strictly neutral when it came to politics.“There are things we have concerns about that Labour is proposing, around regulation of the labour market, and freezing energy prices and interventions in banking, but we like what they are saying on things like education and industrial strategy,” she said.“We’re pleased with what the Conservatives are doing on corporation tax but we’re concerned about some of their rhetoric on immigration.”For now Labour believes it is on the right side of public opinion; party insiders pointed to Boris Johnson, Tory mayor of London, criticising the tax affairs of the Boots chief on Tuesday. “I have to say I find it disappointing that he (Pessina) does not cough up for Britain,” said Mr Johnson.——————————————-Letters in response to this report:I was right about business leaders and partisan views / From John Redwood MPOsborne has already set a 60p tax rate / From James Lyon"

Sir Ian, who recently replaced Lord Browne as the top businessman advising government, said: “It has got to be legitimate for business leaders who are involved in big business in the UK, even if they are not UK citizens, to have a view on the likely impact of elections.”The Labour leader’s comments mark an escalation of a row that blew up at the weekend when Mr Pessina told the Sunday Telegraph that a Labour government would be a “catastrophe”.Mr Miliband believes that he is on the side of public opinion given that the Boots chief lives in Monaco and has moved the company to low-tax Switzerland.But the confrontation has prompted some unease with Katja Hall, deputy director-general of the CBI, saying that business people should not be denied the right to join the public debate.“It is important that businesses feel able to speak out about what is good for jobs and growth,” she told the FT. “Business leaders do know what will affect investment; I think it is important that that voice is heard.”Labour is determined to be “robust” in taking on its critics, with Mr Miliband saying during a debate with young people on Sky News: “I don’t think people in Britain are going to take kindly to being lectured by someone who’s avoiding his taxes on how they should be voting in the UK general election.”Mr Miliband added that he would make sure that big foreign companies such as Google and Amazon paid a fair share of tax in the UK — like most British businesses.“You have now got this unholy alliance between the Conservative party and people like him [Mr Pessina] . . . part of my job is to stand up to these powerful forces who aren’t paying taxes.”Boots moved its tax residence to Switzerland after a private equity-backed buyout in 2007, led by Mr Pessina.The UK’s main political parties are facing the prospect of a close and unpredictable national poll on May 7 as they struggle to address the march of the populists

Further readingThe group merged with US group Walgreens last year but abandoned plans to shift its headquarters from the US to Switzerland for tax reasons after a political row.Mr Pessina had suggested that a Labour government could be “not helpful for business”, although he did not criticise any specific party policies.Ed Balls, shadow chancellor, said earlier that the Tories were likely to persuade more high-profile people to attack Labour.“I would think in the next three months we are going to have a number of people brought forward by the Conservatives, whether it’s Gary Barlow or Mr Pessina, saying: ‘Don’t vote Labour’,” he told the BBC’s Today programme.“The idea that somebody who doesn’t pay tax in Britain telling people how to vote will stick in the craw.”Labour is braced for more criticism from the business world in the coming months, not least having proposed higher taxes on the rich.Walgreens Boots Alliance said Mr Pessina’s comments had been “taken out of context” from a much larger conversation: “Stefano Pessina was expressing his personal views only and is not campaigning against Ed Miliband or the Labour party.”The company had paid £550m of tax in 2013-14 including business rates, national insurance and corporation tax, it said.Mr Balls will on Tuesday try to burnish his pro-business credentials at a conference to discuss Britain’s infrastructure needs.The shadow chancellor will announce that a Labour government would legislate to set up an independent “national infrastructure commission” in its first Queen’s Speech after the election.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:I was right about business leaders and partisan views / From John Redwood MP"

Mr Walker added: “In my view it would be a tragedy, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, if Britain left the EU.”On Sunday, Labour shrugged off criticism from Stefano Pessina, acting chief executive of pharmacy business Walgreens Boots Alliance, who said a Labour government would be a “catastrophe”.Mr Pessina is an Italian, Monaco-based billionaire who moved Boots’ domicile to Zug, a low-tax region in Switzerland.Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, said: “The British people and British businesses will draw their own conclusions when those who don’t live here, don’t pay tax in this country and lead firms that reportedly avoid making a fair contribution in what they pay purport to know what is in Britain’s best interests.”One Labour aide warned critics that if they attacked the party they should expect to “face scrutiny” over their motivation for doing so.But while Labour was sanguine about Mr Pessina’s comments, its leadership was braced for more criticism from business people in the run-up to voting on May 7.Labour MPs are aware that many of its policies are unpopular with executives who will bear the brunt of a new mansion tax or a 50p top rate of income taxAt least one pro-Tory letter is already being circulated among business figures for publication during the election campaign.Labour MPs are aware that many of its policies are unpopular with executives who will bear the brunt of a new mansion tax or a 50p top rate of income tax.Mr Miliband has also vigorously pursued energy companies, banks, gambling companies, the tobacco industry and housebuilders with policies designed to help consumers at the expense of big business.The party hopes that it can minimise the attacks from business by focusing on its promise to keep Britain in the EU, a policy that is popular in many boardrooms.Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, will host an event on Tuesday to reiterate his party’s commitment to building infrastructure.The UK’s main political parties are facing the prospect of a close and unpredictable national poll on May 7 as they struggle to address the march of the populists

69;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-12-11T13:52:21Z;Stefano Pessina to become Walgreens Boots Alliance interim chief;Temporary appointment is a reversal of earlier plans for merged group;Stefano Pessina, the billionaire executive chairman of Alliance Boots and a board member of Walgreens, will initially serve as interim chief executive when the two pharmacy chains merge but still plans to return to a strategy role.Boots declined to give new specifics on Friday but pointed to an earlier announcement that Mr Pessina, 73, will serve as executive vice-chairman of the combined US-based company. He will be responsible for strategy and dealmaking and chair a new board-level strategy committee.Ornella Barra, Mr Pessina’s long-term partner and chief executive of wholesale and brands at Alliance Boots, is still set to become executive vice-president of Walgreens Boots Alliance, as the combined company will be known. Ms Barra will also serve as president and chief executive of global wholesale and international retail.Walgreens announced on Wednesday that Mr Pessina would temporarily head the combined group because Greg Wasson, Walgreens’ president and chief executive, plans to retire after the merger is completed. The move is a reversal of earlier plans to have Mr Wasson run the combined group.Walgreens will acquire the 55 per cent of Boots that it does not already own as early as February 2015 following a Walgreens shareholder vote on December 29.James Skinner, Walgreens chairman, will also take on executive duties during the search for a permanent chief executive. The combined company will have 12,800 stores in 12 countries and a drug distribution business in 20 countries.Mr Pessina, who is one of the architects of the deal, said: “I look forward to working with James Skinner and all the leaders of the future enterprise when we launch the combined group.”It is not the first time Mr Pessina, who is the largest shareholder in Alliance Boots and will own about 20 per cent of the stock of the combined company, has stepped into a management role. In 2011, after Andy Hornby resigned suddenly as Alliance Boots’ chief executive, the Italian entrepreneur temporarily took over some of Mr Hornby’s duties.Walgreens bought 45 per cent of Boots for $6.7bn in 2012, four years after Mr Pessina and private equity group KKR bought the UK’s largest pharmacy chain by number of stores, then Europe’s biggest buyout. The £10bn transaction contained an option for the US company to acquire the remaining portion three years later.Mr Pessina made about £500m from the original acquisition of Alliance Boots, which is now domiciled in Bern, Switzerland. However, he and KKR did not take a dividend while it was in their ownership. Mr Pessina took shares from the first phase of the deal with Walgreens, giving him an 8 per cent stake worth about $4.5bn.The second phase will see the value of his 20 per cent holding swell to around $13bn at the current share price. He originally invested $2.5bn.
70;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-10-15T19:32:04Z;Inversions should not (hop) scotch healthy trend for tax competition;While tax-driven deals are not yet dead, they are pallid and shaky;"We come not to bury tax inversions but to praise them. The news that US drugs group AbbVie of the US may back out of its $54bn takeover of UK-listed rival Shire shows that while tax-driven deals are not yet dead, they are pallid and shaky. However, they have served a political purpose, even if they failed in their financial aim, in highlighting the improbably high taxes to which US corporations are exposed.Flipping their domiciles overseas through share-based takeovers has allowed US groups to cut effective tax rates of almost 30 per cent by up to 10 percentage points. It has also helped them to pay out some of their overseas cash piles to shareholders. AbbVie’s absorption of Shire, a specialist in orphan and hyperactivity drugs, is an important test case of their resolve. One the Chicago-based group looks set to flunk.Pfizer’s £70bn tilt at AstraZeneca of the UK was damaged by resistance from a UK elite that, for all its claims to the contrary, nurtures national champions. Walgreens, which dropped plans to relocate to Europe when buying pharmacies chain Alliance Boots, had a consumer brand to nurture. Neither factor stood in the way of AbbVie’s purchase of footloose Shire.What has disrupted the deal is a political backlash in the US that M&A bankers have persistently and wrongly played down. The Obama administration cannot raise the proportion of foreign ownership needed for a merged business to execute a tax inversion without legislation. But it has been able to clamp down on so-called “hopscotch loans”, through which offshore cash may be channelled tax efficiently to the US.Savvas Neophytou of brokers Panmure Gordon believes that the reform may prompt AbbVie to renegotiate new terms with Shire. But a 25 per cent drop in Shire’s shares this morning shows market hopes of this are low. AbbVie may be liable for a $1.6bn break fee if it tells shareholders to vote against a deal. This beautiful relationship, like so many others, may end acrimoniously in court.The cognitive dissonance gripping observers in the UK, where effective corporate tax rates are about 20 per cent, is the high social charges borne by US business, of which tax inversions are the deformed fruit. This is out of kilter with the country’s deserved pro-business reputation. One receives the same shock on discovering the real name of tough-guy actor John Wayne was “Marion”.The explanation is that the US prefers to tax its citizens more heavily through corporations than it does directly. This is politically convenient but creates an incentive for companies to play skilful games with cash flows – poker rather than hopscotch – to reduce the impact. The process has been fuelled by cynical incentives from job-hungry jurisdictions, such as Ireland, which this week was forced to say it would close its “double Irish” tax loophole.However, tax competition between nations at the level of headline and effective corporate tax rates is entirely healthy. It encourages transparency and checks the ambitions of spendthrift politicians. The duality of tax is that it is both intensely dull and a lively battle front between the state and the individual. Some policy wonks promote the idea of governments agreeing tax rates as a solution to avoidance. This would be an outcome of the inversions imbroglio far less palatable than the collapse of one takeover deal.Upside of the downturnHarbinger O’Doom Lombard’s meltdowns correspondent is back in action after a long furlough.

Analysts on Wall Street had expected the company to report net income of $613m.When adjusted for one time items, Walgreens profit was 74 cents a share, in line with forecasts.Revenue climbed 6 per cent to $19.1bn, in line with consensus expectations, as same-store sales increased 5.4 per cent.Walgreens shares fell 1 per cent to $59.27, reducing its gain for the year to 3 per cent.

72;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-08-20T14:49:54Z;What next for M&A now the bubble has burst?;Shift in stance by the US government is an important indicator of future M&A volumes;Tuesday August 5 was a bad day for all those hoping the mergers and acquisitions boom had further to run. Investment bankers had been rubbing their hands over the year-to-date tally – $2.3tn of announced deals globally, according to Dealogic, with more deals in Europe and Asia than in the whole of last year. Then, in the space of a few hours, the bubble burst, as takeover proposals worth more than $100bn collapsed.But a bad day for financial advisers also held good news for investors.Deals that hit the wall, and the headlines, included 21st Century Fox’s $71bn attempt to buy Time Warner and Sprint’s informal approach, reportedly worth $30bn, for rival carrier T-Mobile US (which in turn rejected an unsolicited $15bn bid for part of its business from French operator Iliad).However, the most interesting deal that day was the one that went ahead. Walgreens, the US drugstore chain, pushed on with its $10bn acquisition of the rest of Alliance Boots, the UK pharmacy in which it bought a majority stake last year. Crucially, though, the US company did not use the transaction to re-establish its headquarters in Europe and save billions of dollars in US tax, a strategy known as a tax inversion.Investors had not demanded that it abandon this aspect of the deal. Instead, Walgreens recognised the growing political opposition to such tax-fuelled transactions.The company said it was mindful of the public reaction to a potential inversion deal, given that it was an “iconic American consumer retail company with a major portion of its revenues derived from government-funded reimbursement programmes”. A sensible move, given the increased grumbling heard in Washington, from Barack Obama to Carl Levin, about US companies moving to Europe to take advantage of preferential tax regimes.Bankers and other advisers are still clinging to the hope that companies less in the public spotlight than Walgreens will be tempted by inversion deals. But, even if Republicans and Democrats find it hard to agree on how to tighten the rules, there is a growing sense on Wall Street that legislation is on the cards.A decline in companies’ willingness or ability to take advantage of generous tax benefits in Europe, or a shift in stance by the US government itself, is an important indicator of future M&A volumes.All the latest news on deals and dealmaking from around the worldFurther readingTax inversions have been a significant driver of the surge in M&A this year, with many of the largest transactions initiated by US companies seeking to deploy trapped offshore cash: notably Pfizer’s failed $116bn bid for AstraZeneca, the $43bn purchase of Dublin-based Covidien by Medtronic, the medical devices maker, and Abbvie’s attempt to buy the British drug company Shire for $53bn.Even so, a change in approach should cause investors to heave a sigh of relief. Tax benefits rarely, if ever, constitute a good reason for doing a deal. The appeal may be superficially obvious, allowing chief executives to put a convincing number on the savings a transaction would deliver. But such a rationale exposes shareholders to a number of risks.First, tax policy can change. It is possible that the new European Commission heads taking office this autumn will try to act on the diverse tax regimes that operate across the eurozone.Second, revenue-strapped governments across the region could, in any case, change their minds about the benefits of offering tax sweeteners.Third, companies can use a potential tax inversion to avoid making a proper case for the financial benefits of a deal, let alone the industrial logic. Pfizer’s move on AstraZeneca was a case in point. So is the oddly constructed merger between the Irish and US banana companies Fyffes and Chiquita. It may have been derailed by a Brazilian counterbid but it had originally involved Chiquita re-establishing in Ireland.Finally, tax inversions were driving an M&A boom that was starting to look bubbly. Deal fever was being stoked not just by the need for US companies to put offshore cash piles to work, but also by the absurdly generous market borrowing terms available.Dealogic points out that global acquisition-related corporate debt volumes have totalled $102bn so far in 2014, up 43 per cent from the same period a year ago. US borrowers have recorded the largest year-on-year percentage increase, with volume up 66 per cent to $214.1bn in 2014, the highest total since the same period in 2007.Given that year was the peak of the last M&A bubble, a cooling of buyers’ ardour as demand for tax inversions wanes should be welcomed.Sarah Gordon is the FT’s Europe business editor
73;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Stefano Pessina’s patience pays off at Alliance Boots;;Entrepreneurs are not always known for their patience. But billionaire Stefano Pessina, the 73-year-old businessman, has shown remarkable fortitude in building a retail and pharmaceuticals wholesaling empire over the past 40 years.This week, one of the most important pieces of the jigsaw was put in place – the final sale of the whole of Alliance Boots, which Mr Pessina and private equity group KKR had acquired six years earlier, to US group Walgreens.Mr Pessina, says Samuel Johar, chairman of headhunter Buchanan Harvey, has built the business “block by block” to create a transatlantic drug retailing and wholesaling powerhouse.White-haired, bespectacled and always smartly suited, Mr Pessina was born to a well-to-do Milanese family with eclectic business interests. He trained as a nuclear engineer but, in the mid-1970s, joined his family’s local pharmaceutical wholesale business.He set about expanding, first in Italy, and then across Europe, with deals in France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Morocco to create Alliance Santé.In the process, Mr Pessina met his long-time partner Ornella Barra, when he acquired her drug distribution business in 1986. The glamorous Ms Barra now runs Alliance Boots’ pharmaceutical wholesale division, and will retain this role at Walgreens.In 1998 Alliance Santé merged with the UK’s UniChem, creating Alliance UniChem. But Mr Pessina had his eyes on an even bigger prize: Boots, the high street chemist under pressure from the supermarkets and government healthcare cuts.He first knocked on Boots’ door in 2000, only to be turned away. Five years later, he tried again, and in 2006 a deal was signed. Just one year later, Mr Pessina teamed up with the US private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts to seal his most audacious deal to date: the £12bn acquisition of the combined group, then Europe’s biggest buyout.Dominic Murphy, who heads KKR’s operations in the UK and led the deal, says: “Mr Pessina has always skilfully and creatively executed the next logical deal to do.”As well as demonstrating extraordinary patience, Mr Pessina has been opportunistic.“At all times, he has spotted opportunities that would take him a step closer to his goal, and then been bold enough to grab them,” says Mr Johar.But in another way, Mr Pessina and KKR’s timing could not have been worse. They faced integrating two big businesses, burdened by £9bn of debt, just as global markets were turning downwards.Yet they persevered, and Mr Pessina says it was the combination of Alliance UniChem and Boots that laid the foundation for the tie-up with Walgreens.Rather than using the cash from Boots to plant flags around the globe, Mr Pessina and KKR chose to invest in the company, which began life selling herbal remedies in Nottingham in 1849 and was still headquartered in the city.“At the end of the day, it was a bet. At the time we could have chosen to utilise Boots as a cash cow, to develop the business somewhere else. In reality, we saw the opportunity in Boots,” he says.They invested £1bn in the first three to four years, revamping stores and beefing up Boots’ stable of own brands, such as No 7 cosmetics, the natural Botanics range and Soltan skincare.Rather than taking cash out of the company and flipping it quickly back on to the stock market, as many buyout groups tend to do, Mr Murphy says the approach “was always to invest in the business, as it was the right thing to do”.I took some time. We had conversations with many American players, particularly on the wholesaling side. But then we found WalgreensMr Pessina wanted to extend the group further, believing that a presence in the US was imperative. As usual he was prepared to wait for the right partner.“I took some time,” he says. “We had conversations with many American players, particularly on the wholesaling side. But then we found Walgreens.”Building his global empire, however, has come with its own challenges. Mr Pessina cut jobs and closed the Boots final-salary pension scheme to existing members after describing it as unfair.But the biggest controversy has been over tax. Mr Pessina, who lives in Monaco, moved the group’s domicile to the low-tax region of Zug in Switzerland. Indeed, Walgreens decided not to move its headquarters to the UK, partly for fear of a consumer backlash.This week, as Mr Pessina unveiled Walgreens’ £9bn cash-and-shares offer for the 55 per cent of Alliance Boots that it did not already own, he acknowledged that the groups had been “a little too preoccupied with the transaction”.Investors would be “disappointed” with lower than expected targets for 2016, he said. “I will not pretend to be particularly happy about it myself,” he added, in his usual forthright style.Nick Bubb, the independent retail analyst, says Mr Pessina is the “consummate dealmaker”, but while his personal wealth has been increased by the tie-up with Walgreens, the performance of the company has suffered.Mr Pessina, who has said he is “not looking for money”, made about £500m from the original buyout of Boots. However, he and KKR did not take a dividend while it was in their ownership. Mr Pessina took shares from the first phase of the deal with Walgreens, giving him an 8 per cent stake worth about $4.5bn. The second phase will see his holding swell to between 15 per cent and 20 per cent, worth between about $9bn and $12bn at the current share price. He originally invested $2.5bn.He will take a break from deal hunting for the time being, but says there may be “other things to do” in the future.People close to him believe his dream of creating a global retail and pharmaceutical wholesaling group is moving closer, but he still has his eye on one last frontier: China. Latin America and possibly even Africa are also on his horizon.At the age when other executives are heading for the golf course, Mr Pessina says he has no plans to slow down. Indeed, under the new management structure he will be responsible for Walgreens’ strategy, as well as mergers and acquisitions.As one long-time associate quips: “He will never retire.”
74;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-08-08T17:50:36Z;US groups ponder the great tax escape;;Walgreen’s decision to keep its domicile in the US will not deter other US healthcare companies from striking transatlantic deals to cut their American tax bills, according to corporate advisers.The US pharmacy chain had come under pressure from investors to shift its tax domicile to Switzerland or Britain as part of the £6bn takeover of Alliance Boots, but this week concluded such a move was not in the best long-term interest of its shareholders.Walgreens said it was mindful of the public reaction to a potential inversion deal and its role as an “iconic American consumer retail company with a major portion of its revenues derived from government-funded reimbursement programs”. But advisers said that lesser-known companies contemplating so-called inversion deals would ride out the storm.Billy Tauzin, a former congressman and ex-head of a pharmaceuticals lobby group who now advises companies, said it would make sense for businesses to delay their inversion plans until after November elections, but that few would scrap them.“They’re all public companies and investors expect them to make economic decisions, not necessarily just politically smart decisions,” said Mr Tauzin. “They might want to time it differently, but I don’t think they’re going to change what is the right economic decision for their companies.”The two biggest inversion deals agreed so far have involved relatively low-profile US healthcare companies. Medtronic, the medical devices maker, agreed to buy Dublin-based Covidien for $42.9bn in June, followed a month later by the £32bn takeover of UK-listed Shire by AbbVie.People close to those deals said they were confident they would go ahead – but declines in the share prices of Shire and Covidien this week reflected investor fears.Political attacks on inversions have been building for weeks. President Barack Obama and some Democrats are seeking to make such deals a campaign issue ahead of midterm elections on November 4, and have criticised the “corporate deserters” who had “renounced their US citizenship” by moving offshore.Republicans have been equally critical of the deals, but they want any legislative solution to be part of broader tax reform, which is unlikely to pass the US Congress. The Obama administration this week said it was exploring ways to use the president’s executive powers to limit inversions, but lawyers say it is not clear it has sufficient authority.Before its announcement, Walgreens had been braced for anti-inversion protests and boycotts from union groups such as Change To Win, a labour federation.We had a lot of perspectives from the political side, the White House, consumers, and we looked at all the issues …We did not think the structure had a high enough confidence level to withstand that“We had a lot of perspectives from the political side, the White House, consumers, and we looked at all the issues,” said Greg Wasson, Walgreens’ chief executive. “We did not think the structure had a high enough confidence level to withstand that.”On the day Walgreens announced its decision, a Change To Win official said the group received a new consignment of now redundant signs and banners with slogans such as “Walgreens – Don’t Short Change America”.But Mr Tauzin said it would be harder to stir public opposition to healthcare groups. “I’m a cancer survivor and a company in California made the product that saved my life. I don’t think it would have mattered to me if I was upset with that company politically,” he said.“On the other hand, if I can buy the same over-the-counter product at Walmart or CVS and I’m upset with Walgreens, I might make a different choice.”It is a big dilemma for Pfizer, the largest US drugmaker by sales, which in May attempted what would have been the biggest inversion so far with a £69.4bn bid for the UK’s AstraZeneca. While it is a less visible brand than Walgreens, it is still a household name associated with well-known drugs such as Viagra and Lipitor.Underlining the sensitivity for high-profile consumer brands in particular, Bob Iger, the chief executive of Walt Disney, this week ruled out relocating overseas.An adviser to Walgreens said the pharmacy chain was also concerned that its rival CVS Caremark would exploit an inversion by painting Walgreens as unpatriotic.“There was some growing concern among Republican political operatives and trade associations like the Chamber of Commerce that the inversion issue could get traction in key election races,” he said. “This reduces that as an issue.”Nell Geiser, an associate director at Change To Win, the labour group, disagreed. She vowed to keep up the pressure on companies considering inversions – including those with little name recognition – and said activists would shine a harsh spotlight on businesses that depended on federal healthcare spending and other US government funds.“Now the issue itself is a brand name,” she said.Additional reporting by Andrew Ward in London
75;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-08-08T09:55:41Z;Letter from Lex: let’s call a halt;It was a week to feel the pain of the M&A banker;It was a week to feel the pain of the M&A banker. In the space of a few hours on Tuesday, the bonuses promised by two huge deals were snatched away by cautious clients. First, 21st Century Fox said it was no longer pursuing Time Warner. Then Sprint abandoned its pursuit of T-Mobile US.The collapse of the former was always on the cards. Time Warner was not interested, the rise in its share price made the deal more expensive for Fox, and the logic behind the deal was always shaky. The latter also faced challenges. T-Mobile is a much healthier company now than it was when the process started, while Sprint is struggling. There would also have been a battle with the regulators.Still, don’t feel too sorry for those M&A advisers. Although two big deals failed, others succeeded. Walgreens bought out the 55 per cent of Alliance Boots that it did not already own, as it had planned to do for the past two years. However it decided against the idea of structuring the deal as a tax inversion, as some shareholders had demanded. That, combined with a cut to its 2016 targets, sent its shares down sharply.Elsewhere, Priceline is to invest $500m in Ctrip, a Chinese travel site, via a convertible bond. An equity investment may follow as Priceline seeks to grab a share of the $160bn a year that Chinese tourists spend on overseas trips. And the dealmakers at Evercore were busy with deals of their own, as the investment bank expanded in equities and research. The acquisitions put Evercore halfway between boutique advisers such as Moelis and Greenhill, and the bulge bracket banks. And into the “work in progress” box goes a potential deal for GVT, Vivendi’s Brazilian telecoms business. Telefónica has made a €6.7bn offer for it. Telecom Italia is also interested.Companies that cannot find attractive opportunities have been reverting to plan B: the share buyback. 21st Century Fox is to buy back $6bn of shares. Nestlé is to buy back SFr8bn of shares. And Groupon has spent $106m on buybacks in the past quarter, despite being lossmaking.There are even suggestions that Bank of America, with a $16bn settlement over mortgage-backed securities out of the way, should start thinking about a buyback as early as next March. But that would be premature – the bank still has other regulatory matters to settle, and US regulators are showing a taste for ever bigger fines.The investment bankers might not like it, but sometimes the best thing for a company to do is nothing at all.Have a good weekend.Oliver Ralph, Deputy Head of Lex
76;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-08-06T21:52:44Z;Pharma shares slide on fears of ‘tax inversion’ clampdown;;Investors fled global healthcare stocks on Wednesday after the Obama administration threatened action to halt the wave of transatlantic acquisitions by American companies seeking to cut their US tax bills.The sharp fall in several UK, Swiss and Irish companies reflected investor fears that one of the main driving forces behind this year’s surge of cross-border dealmaking in the healthcare sector could be brought to a halt by US political intervention.Shares in Walgreens, the US pharmacy chain, plunged more than 14 per cent after it confirmed it would pass up an opportunity to move its tax home to Switzerland in another sign that political pressure against inversions is beginning to work.Walgreens announced a well-trailed £9bn deal to acquire full control of Switzerland-based Alliance Boots – but without an inversion that could have saved the company billions of dollars in taxes. Gregory Wasson, Walgreens chief executive, told the Financial Times an inversion would likely have faced “intense and maybe prolonged” scrutiny from US tax authorities.The decision followed a warning from the US Treasury on Tuesday that it was “reviewing a broad range of authorities for possible administrative action” to deter companies from using cross-border deals to escape US taxes.Lawmakers in Congress who have led attacks on inversion deals welcomed the decision by Walgreens. But congressional staff said the U-turn did not signal victory in the broader fight against inversions and vowed that work would continue on legislation to curb them.Political attacks on inversions have been building for weeks, with President Barack Obama last month criticising the “corporate deserters” who had “renounced their US citizenship” by moving offshore.On Wednesday, Mr Obama said he did not want the inversions trend to grow. “We don’t want companies who have up until now been playing by the rules suddenly looking over their shoulder and saying … ‘Some of our competitors are gaming the system. We need to do it too’.”Shire, the UK pharmaceuticals company, was the biggest victim of the European sell-off on Wednesday as investors worried that its £32bn takeover by AbbVie of the US could be imperilled. Its stock fell 4 per cent to £46.80, below the £52.48 a share cash and stock offer agreed with AbbVie.AstraZeneca, the UK drugmaker which was the subject of a failed £69.4bn bid from Pfizer in May, was down 3.6 per cent, while Smith & Nephew, the UK medical devices maker considered to be another inversion target, dropped 4.1 per cent.Actelion, the Swiss biotech company, and Alkermes, an Irish-based drugmaker, were both down at least 2.5 per cent.An aide to Ron Wyden, the Democratic chair of the Senate finance committee, said: “Let’s hope this really is a turn in the tide, but I don’t think you’re going to see people here let up. It’s great that one company has decided to do the right thing, but we’re going to push forward to put laws in place to stop companies from abusing this loophole.”Few on Wall Street believe Washington will be able to block the wave of inversion deals already in the works. Worldwide pending or completed inversions are at $139.4bn for the year to date, or about 6.5 per cent of the total M&A market, according to Thomson Reuters.However, some have started warning that tax management should not be allowed to replace strategic thinking.“There is a serious degree of indigestion with inversions and the market wants to move on,” said John Studzinski, global head of Blackstone Advisory Partners. “There is a lot of scrutiny and, with it, reputational risk.”Republicans have so far resisted legislative action, arguing that any move to close the inversion loophole should be part of broader reform to make the US tax system more competitive. At 35 per cent, the US has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the developed world.Orrin Hatch, the senior Republican on the Senate finance committee, said: “Walgreens’ decision is a welcome development, but it is still imperative Congress work together moving forward in order to make our corporate tax system more attractive for US companies.”Stephen Shay, a professor at Harvard Law School and former international tax lawyer at the US Treasury, last week called on the administration to adopt regulations that would “materially reduce” the tax incentives behind inversions. Companies that eroded their US tax bills by lending money to their US subsidiaries could be thwarted by new rules reclassifying their debt as equity, he said.Willard Taylor, adjunct professor at New York University Law School, said it remained highly uncertain whether the US Treasury had the power to take such steps. But he added that any companies pursuing inversions should expect extremely tough scrutiny of their remaining US tax affairs by the Internal Revenue Service.Under its proposed deal with Shire, AbbVie would shift its tax domicile to the UK in a move that would reduce its average tax rate from 22 per cent to 13 per cent.Additional reporting by Vanessa Houlder
77;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-08-06T17:52:13Z;Walgreens: Boots made for walking;No inversion and weak outlook add up to $8bn in lost value;"What is the value of a tax inversion? About $8bn, if Wednesday’s fall in Walgreens’ market capitalisation is anything to go by. Structuring the pharmacy chain’s acquisition of Alliance Boots as an inversion would have been lucrative (a deal has been on the cards since it bought a 45 per cent stake two years ago). Taxing Walgreen’s $3.9bn of 2013 pre-tax profits at Alliance Boots’s underlying 14 per cent rate (rather than its own 37 per cent rate) would have generated $900m of earnings. But Walgreens’ board, mindful of public opinion, political rhetoric and its exposure to US government-funded health schemes, decided not to seek those savings. No wonder its shareholders are in pain.But a tax inversion would – in pharmaceutical terms – have been a painkiller; something that would mask the symptoms without addressing the problem. And that 12 per cent share price drop has as much to do with the problem as it does with the lack of a painkiller. Alongside the deal, Walgreens unveiled new targets, including 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $4.25-$4.60. When the first part of the Alliance Boots deal was done, $5-$5.50 was expected by 2016. Low margin contracts since then are to blame. Ouch.Cost savings should soften the blow. As well as the $1bn initially expected – mainly in purchasing power – there is another $1bn targeted through cost savings by 2017. There is also a push to improve gross margins by selling more own brands and beauty products.The deal is not cheap for Walgreens. It paid $6.7bn in cash and shares for the first 45 per cent of Alliance Boots in 2012. Because of the rise in its share price since then, it is paying $14bn for the remaining 55 per cent. But consolidation makes sense. It is time to stop worrying about the painkillers and start treating the problem.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com"
78;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-08-06T12:02:37Z;Pessina hails Walgreens acquisition of Boots;;Two years ago Stefano Pessina took the first step in pulling off what he described as a transformational deal. He and private equity group KKR had sold 45 per cent of Alliance Boots – the company they had taken private five years earlier – to US giant Walgreen.Mr Pessina has now completed the process, earlier than expected, with the US pharmacy chain exercising an option to acquire the remaining 55 per cent of Alliance Boots for about £9bn in cash and shares.Mr Pessina and KKR had bought Alliance Boots for roughly £12bn in 2007, then Europe’s biggest buy-out, only to grapple with a global downturn and the burden of £9bn in debt.The 73-year-old entrepreneur hailed the second step of the transaction on Wednesday as “the most significant milestone in the history of Alliance Boots,” which was founded in Nottingham 1849 as a single store selling herbal remedies.The deal is also good news for Mr Pessina personally.He currently owns about 8 per cent of Walgreens, worth about $4.5bn. He is expected to take his share of the consideration for the second stage of the deal in shares, with KKR taking its portion in cash.Assuming the deal is completed, Mr Pessina will hold up to 20 per cent of Walgreens Boots Alliance, as the combined company will be known, worth about $13bn. He put $2.5bn of his own money into the original buy-out.As for KKR, it has made more than three times its money in pounds on the second stage of the deal.Greg Wasson, chief executive of Walgreens, will hold the same role at Walgreens Boots Alliance.With a full combination, Walgreens Boots Alliance will comprise more than 11,000 stores in 10 countries, along with the world’s largest pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution network, covering 20 countries.It will also include brands, such as Alliance Boots’s No 7 cosmetics business and sun-care range Soltan.“We are lifting Walgreens from a US only business to a truly international group with Alliance Boots,” says Mr Wasson.Mr Pessina says that for the time being, Walgreens Boots Alliance will be focused on making the deal work, despite his serial deal-making over the years.Rather than adding to the empire, Mr Pessina and Mr Wasson must deal with pressure on pharmacies around the world, as governments seek to contain healthcare costs.Walgreens announced with the deal that it had lowered expectations for the 2016 financial year, because of the pressure on its pharmaceutical business, including in the US.“Pressure on the pharmacies is a global issue,” says Mr Pessina.He also acknowledges that the two companies had become “a little too pre-occupied with the transaction”. With the decision to exercise the option for the second stage of the deal, and for the combined business to remain domiciled in the US, “now is the time to back up [the companies’] words with action”.Walgreens Boots Alliance set out plans to achieve the targeted $1bn of cost savings more quickly. Alliance Boots’s net debt has already fallen substantially, to £5bn at March 2014.But another plank – and part of the rationale for the deal – is developing Walgreens’ retail offering. This is something that Boots in the UK has already been forced to do by market pressures.“Twenty years ago, Boots was making its money on the pharmacies – 75 per cent of the profit was coming from the pharmacies. Today 75 per cent comes from the front of the store,” says Mr Pessina.Mr Wasson says Walgreens hopes to learn from Boots’s experience, for example in developing its in-house beauty brands. The appointment of Alex Gourlay – who previously ran Boots’ health and beauty division – as president of Walgreens should help the US company replicate Boots’s success in this area.“Regarding some of the learnings from Boots, that is one of the things that intrigued me back when Stefano and I began to talk, what [Boots] were able to do over the last five to 10 years,” says Mr Wasson.
79;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-08-05T22:16:00Z;Walgreens drops plans to relocate HQ;;Walgreens has ruled out relocating its headquarters from the US for tax purposes as the US pharmacy chain is set to announce a nearly £6bn deal to acquire full control of Switzerland-based retailer Alliance Boots.A deal for the 55 per cent of Boots that Walgreens does not already own could come as soon as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter.A sale would complete a complex transaction between the two drug retailers in 2012 in which Walgreens acquired 45 per cent of Boots for $6.7bn and the right to take full control of the company as soon as February 2015.One person close to the matter said Walgreens elected not to pursue an inversion as it calculated that it would face greater scrutiny than others, since it was a consumer facing company. Shares in Walgreens fell 4.2 per cent to $69.12 in New York trading. Sky News first reported the story.Inversions have become one the most controversial issues in dealmaking as officials including US President Barack Obama and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew have criticised companies for seeking deals that would allow them to move their corporate headquarters overseas.The Obama administration said on Tuesday that it was exploring ways it could bypass Congress and use the president’s executive authority to rein in inversion deals.A Treasury department spokeswoman said it was “reviewing a broad range of authorities for possible administrative actions” to limit the deals or reduce their tax benefits.Democrats and Republicans have attacked the deals, which they say rob the US of tax revenues and jobs, but they cannot agree on how to combat them.The Financial Times revealed in April that Walgreens had come under intense pressure from hedge funds and other investors to pursue an inversion as part of its plans to acquire the remainder of Boots.At a private meeting in Paris, investors including hedge funds Jana Partners, Corvex and Och-Ziff lobbied the company’s management to use its takeover of Boots to re-domicile its tax base.US healthcare and pharmaceutical companies such as Mylan and AbbVie are among the corporations that have acquired all or parts of European businesses in recent weeks to escape US taxes. Pfizer, the drug company, failed in its $120bn bid to buy the UK’s AstraZeneca in a deal that would have allowed the Viagra maker to redomicile its headquarters overseas.

Angst is now rising over Walgreens, a drugstore chain that could use its agreed takeover of Switzerland-based Alliance Boots to redomicile.Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate finance committee, intensified his attacks on inversions on Tuesday. “The inversion virus now seems to be multiplying every few days,” he said. “How many more infections can America’s economic body endure?”He complained that even as they hurt US employment and shrank the country’s tax base, the deals were being promoted by “fast-buck artists” such as investment bankers, private equity groups, lawyers and accountants.“With the investment bankers in that inversion feeding frenzy, there may be 25 more inversions during [this year],” he told a hearing of the Senate finance committee.In inversion deals in the past month, Medtronic announced the $42.9bn acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien and AbbVie agreed to take over the UK’s Shire for $54bn.Speaking for the Obama administration, Robert Stack, an official at the US Treasury, told the hearing: “We are aware of many more inversions in the works right now”.Companies and their advisers on both sides of the Atlantic remain undaunted by the political onslaught in Washington, calculating that the chances of Congress passing bipartisan legislation to curb inversions are slim.Last week, Jack Lew, Treasury secretary, urged lawmakers to pass a White House proposal – backed by Mr Wyden – to stamp out inversions, which would lift the foreign ownership threshold for such deals from 20 per cent to 50 per cent.Although senior Republicans have also lambasted inversions, the two parties cannot agree on how to tackle the problem.Orrin Hatch, the most senior Republican senator on the finance committee, criticised proposed countermeasures from the White House and others as being mainly “punitive and retroactive”. He said that rather than “incentivising American companies to remain in the US, these bills would build walls around US corporations in order to keep them from inverting”.The inversion virus now seems to be multiplying every few days. How many more infections can America’s economic body endure?He added that they could have the unintended consequence of encouraging “reverse acquisition” inversions by making US companies more attractive targets for foreign suitors.Chris Krueger, an independent analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said the probability of Congress taking action on inversions this year was less than 10 per cent.Politicians will go on a five-week recess next week and when they return minds will be focused on November elections.In a statement echoed by many Republicans, the Business Roundtable, which represents blue-chip companies, said last week that inversions were symptoms of failures of a US tax system that hampers US competitiveness.It said “piecemeal” bills to curb the deals were not the answer and repeated its longstanding calls for comprehensive tax reform.Mr Wyden said he had invited the chief executives of several companies doing inversions to testify, but they had not accepted.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Switch and you are on your own / From Mr Arnold Holtzman
81;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-06-24T17:17:46Z;Walgreens: true love;Is the tie-up with Boots more than a marriage of convenience?;The string of recent tax inversion tie-ups reeks of awkwardness. The buyer and seller profess their deep compatibility. Yet it all seems like a marriage of convenience. Fortunately, drug retailers Walgreens and Alliance Boots began their courtship in 2012, way before the recent tax fad, so their love must be sincere. That sincerity is something to keep in mind because Walgreens reported weak quarterly results on Tuesday. It also hinted that when it announced shortly how it would acquire the 55 per cent of Alliance Boots it did not already own, a new tax scheme may be part of the plan.Walgreens’ third-quarter results, ironically, already revealed the soothing power of lower taxes. Earnings per share came in at 91c, a few cents light of expectations. Walgreens cited pressures in reimbursement pricing for drugs as well as unexpected cost inflation in generics. However, its tax rate was only 31 per cent against the usual 38 per cent.The long-term threat of pharma price wars prompted two dramatic transactions at Walgreens. Two years ago, it acquired the minority stake in the UK’s Alliance Boots for $7bn. In 2013, it took a stake in drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen and signed a long-term supply agreement.On Tuesday, Walgreens said that by early August it would give more details on how it would buy the remaining portion of Alliance Boots. When the deal was announced two years ago, Walgreens expected to capture $1bn of annual deal benefits and $9.5bn of operating profit. The synergy goal would be exceeded but the profit goal would not, the company stated. Cryptically, it also said its revised profit goals may have opportunities “below the operating line” (perhaps tax efficiency). So Walgreens may find a new corporate home across the Atlantic. Unsurprising, but perhaps it is comforting that these lovebirds found each other years ago.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
82;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-06-17T14:56:51Z;UK officials reject tax complaints against Alliance Boots;;British officials have rejected complaints by two campaign groups over the taxation and disclosure of transactions undertaken by Alliance Boots, the pharmacy company, saying the issues raised were “not material and substantiated”.War on Want, a British anti-poverty campaign group and Change to Win, a US organisation lobbying for the rights of working and middle-class Americans, last year complained that Alliance Boots breached OECD guidelines for multinationals in certain deals it undertook after the financial crisis.But in a ruling published by the UK’s business department on Monday, officials said they did “not consider that the issues raised in the complaint are substantiated such that they merit further examination”.In the original complaint, the campaign groups scrutinised transactions that started at the end of 2009, in which two Irish companies – set up by a Luxembourg finance company owned by Alliance Boots’ executive chairman Stefano Pessina – acquired £226m of the group’s senior and subordinated facilities loans.They alleged that the “related party” transactions unfairly reduced the tax paid in the UK, which had adverse impacts on UK citizens. They pointed to OECD guidelines that said transactions should not be structured in a way that have tax results that are inconsistent with “the underlying economic consequences of the transaction”.The company vigorously rejected the allegations and said it complied with all tax rules.The ruling by the UK government officials – who acted as the “national contact point” for the OECD guidelines for multilateral enterprises – found no evidence that the taxation of the deals was at odds with their underlying economic substance or UK rules.It referred to OECD guidelines that said companies comply with the spirit of tax laws if they take “reasonable steps” to determine the intention of lawmakers and interpret tax rules in the light of the language of the law and recent court cases. It said there was no evidence that the UK parliament or courts had made any specific statements about the type of transactions undertaken by the company.Revenue & Customs would have been able to make its intentions clear to the company because of its “client relationship management approach” to big companies that allows it to address risks “in real time”, it said. But it added that the UK authorities and others “may in the future set out publicly their intentions in the area raised by the complaint” as a result of international work on tackling tax base erosion and profit shifting.The ruling also dismissed criticisms that there was insufficient disclosure of the transactions, saying it was “highly unlikely” that the small number of professional or corporate investors were not fully aware of all material information. It also said the campaign groups had failed to show that more disclosure would have improved public understanding of the business.
83;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-05-19T21:18:45Z;US drugstores boosted by tax move speculation;Pfizer gains after saying rejected offer for Astra will be its last;Shares of US drugstores were lifted on Monday on reports one of the country’s largest chains would use a takeover to re-domicile itself abroad to cut its tax costs.The move, reportedly being considered by Walgreens, the owner of Duane Reade and its own eponymous drugstore chain, would dramatically reduce the company’s taxes and allow it to increase earnings per share by as much as 75 per cent, some Wall Street analysts say.In April, Walgreens investors lobbied management to use its $16bn takeover of Swiss-based Alliance Boots to re-domicile its tax base abroad. Potential political fall out from a tax inversion tempered enthusiasm for the deal’s prospects at the time, analysts said.However, that position may have softened. A report in The Sunday Times noted the company could move to re-domicile itself sooner than many investors had thought, following similar comments from analysts with UBS.Shares in Rite Aid rose 2.9 per cent to $7.80 by the close while Walgreens advanced 3.09 per cent to $69.54.Another company at the centre of a potential tax inversion, US-based Pfizer, also gained on Monday after it said its rejected £69bn offer to purchase UK rival AstraZeneca would be its last.Shares in Pfizer rose 0.55 per cent to $29.28 while those of AstraZeneca tumbled 12 per cent to $70.64 in New York trade.Pfizer has ruled out making a hostile offer by going straight to the shareholders of AstraZeneca.Pfizer shares had fallen almost 10 per cent since Ian Read, chief executive – looking to ignite sales growth as patents on some of its best-selling drugs expire – first confirmed the company’s pursuit of AstraZeneca on April 28.Although Pfizer’s shareholders may be relieved that Mr Read and the rest of the board are not prepared to lift their bid higher – or go hostile – they still face the question of where the US company will find quicker growth.Optimism built on Friday, however, after Pfizer briefly halted shares to announce it would submit a new application to US authorities for palbociclib, a treatment for breast cancer, that analysts say could reach $5bn in annual sales if approved.Campbell Soup shares dipped after the soup maker lowered its sales forecast for the current financial year to about 3 per cent from a previous forecast of between 4 and 5 per cent. Weak demand for soup was the chief culprit, with US soup sales flat in the quarter that ended on April 27.“Despite an increase in the frequency of our promotional activity in the third quarter, we did not realise the anticipated lifts in a challenging consumer environment,” chief executive Denise Morrison said.Other parts of Campbell’s food empire helped offset the performance of soups. Sales in the US of simple meals climbed 7 per cent to $672m, including a 25 per cent jump in sauce sales.Overall, profits in the quarter edged up to $184m, or 58 cents a share, from $181m, or 57 cents, in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenues climbed to $1.97bn from $1.96bn. Shares in the company fell 2.35 per cent to $44.06.Gogo, the provider of in-flight wifi, rose 5.8 per cent to $14.48 after investment bank UBS upgraded the company to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’, citing its “reasonable valuation” and ownership of certain wireless spectrum.Overall, US equity markets nudged higher at the start of the week without any major economic reports to sway investors.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.38 per cent to 1,885.08 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.12 per cent higher to 16,511.86. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.86 per cent to 4,125.81.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @EricGPlatt
84;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
85;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-05-15T19:13:36Z;Alliance Boots benefits from Walgreens tie-up;;Alliance Boots, which operates the UK’s largest chain of pharmacies, posted a 31 per cent jump in net profit after gaining market share in the UK and cutting costs through its tie-up with US drugstore Walgreens.Net consolidated profit rose from £741m to £971m in the year ending March, the company reported on Thursday.Revenue increased 4.3 per cent to £23.4bn, while profits from operations rose 20 per cent to £1.3bn.On a consolidated basis, Alliance Boots, which is headquartered in Bern, Switzerland, reported a £2m corporation tax charge for the full year, down from £96m the previous year.“I am pleased to report that Alliance Boots has continued to deliver strong earnings growth, in a year where the markets in which we operate were significantly more challenging than I have experienced for a very long time,” said Stefano Pessina, executive chairman.The company said that its health and beauty unit managed to grow and gain market share in the UK despite an “increasingly competitive and promotion-led trading environment”.Alliance Boots, backed by US private equity group KKR, has been criticised by unions and politicians for paying a low level of taxes. It has been able to do so partly because of its heavy debt costs, which are tax deductible. The company said it paid £90m of corporation taxes in the UK in the fiscal year.George Fairweather, finance director, said that if other taxes were taken into consideration, such as business rates and employers’ national insurance, then the tax bill was £312m. He added that the group’s tax charge had been affected by the UK corporation tax rate coming down.“We are a very significant contributor of tax in the UK as we have said on many occasions,” he said.The group was taken private by Mr Pessina and KKR in a £12bn deal in 2007, the largest leveraged buyout in Europe.It said on Thursday that it had cut its net debt by £842m to £5.1bn, but its finance costs had risen from £373m to £387m.Mr Pessina said the collaboration with Walgreens, the US drugstore chain that bought a 45 per cent stake in the British retailer in 2012, had led to synergies “tracking ahead of target”.Starting in February 2015, Walgreens will have a window of six months in which to exercise its option to buy the rest of Alliance Boots, the company said.Mr Pessina said the second phase of the deal could be executed from February, although the decision on whether to go ahead with the transaction was likely to be taken later this year.“I believe it will go ahead,” he said. “We have been asked to prepare everything. In any case, this is necessary for a board to take a decision.”
86;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-05-06T21:48:06Z;Alliance Boots buys into Latin America with Farmacias Ahumada deal;;Alliance Boots, the retailer and pharmaceutical wholesaler partly owned by Walgreens of the US, has taken its first step into Latin America, with the acquisition of Farmacias Ahumada, for more than £400m.The purchase covers two main businesses, in Mexico and Chile, which together operate over 1,400 stores, with combined annual sales of £835m.Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, said: “This is the first step. Of course there are other big countries in Latin America we are still interested in.”He said the company, which has long been keen to expand into Latin America and bolster its presence in China, was also interested in acquiring operations in Brazil and possibly Colombia.The Farmacias Ahumada deal provides it with retail operations in Mexico and Chile, but Mr Pessina said Alliance Boots was also keen to add a Latin American pharmaceutical wholesaling business. He said the group had looked at opportunities to acquire wholesalers in Latin America, but so far no deal had come to fruition.Alliance Boots is paying £375m for the Latin American pharmacy group, and is assuming about £65m of debt. Farmacias Benavides is the third-largest retail pharmacy chain in Mexico, with around 1,000 stores, while Farmacias Ahumada is one of the three largest pharmacy chains in Chile, with around 400 stores.Mr Pessina said the deals would provide customers in Mexico and Chile with access to Boots brands for the first time, such as its skincare and cosmetics ranges.
87;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-04-13T18:15:04Z;Walgreens urged to leave US to gain tax benefit;Investor group lobbies for shift to Europe;Walgreens has come under pressure from an influential group of its shareholders, who want the US pharmacy chain to consider relocating to Europe, in what would be one of the largest tax inversions ever attempted.At a private meeting in Paris on Friday, investors owning close to 5 per cent of Walgreens’ shares lobbied the company’s management to use its $16bn takeover of Swiss-based Alliance Boots to re-domicile its tax base.The move, known as an inversion, would dramatically reduce Walgreens’ taxable income in the US, which has among the highest corporate tax rates in the world.The investor group, which included Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and hedge funds Jana Partners, Corvex and Och-Ziff, requested the meeting after becoming frustrated by Walgreens’ refusal to consider relocating, according to people familiar with the matter.In a note last month, analysts at UBS said Walgreens’ tax rate was expected to be 37.5 per cent compared with 20 per cent for Boots, and that an inversion could increase earnings per share by 75 per cent. They added, however, that “Walgreens’ management seems more hesitant to pull the trigger near-term due to perceived political risks.”Friday’s meeting was attended by Greg Wasson and Wade Miquelon, Walgreens’ chief executive and chief financial officer, respectively, and Stefano Pessina, the Italian billionaire chairman of Alliance Boots.The discussions, held at the Four Seasons hotel in the city’s upscale 8th arrondissement, were “constructive”, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting.Existing rules mean that a US company can forgo its domestic tax status through a deal that transfers more than 20 per cent of its shares to foreign owners.A tax inversion by Walgreens would be likely to face strong political resistance in the US, where the practice has become increasingly popular during the past two years, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector.As well as pushing the executives to consider an inversion, the shareholder group told Messrs Wasson and Pessina that they wanted to see a greater role for Boots’ management team in running the merged business.Illinois-based Walgreens acquired 45 per cent of Boots for $6.5bn in cash and shares in 2012, with an option to buy the remaining 55 per cent next year for $9.5bn. The combined business would have sales of $110bn, based on 2013 figures.Alliance Boots has been criticised by tax protest groups, including UK Uncut, over claims that it had reduced its tax bill since being taken private by Mr Pessina and private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in a £12bn deal in 2007.Walgreens and Alliance Boots both declined to comment.Additional reporting by Caroline Binham in London
88;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-03-25T16:53:11Z;Walgreens gets boost from Alliance;US equities edge higher as global tensions ease;Walgreens shares rallied after the US retail pharmacy chain began to show signs of benefiting from acquiring a chunk of Alliance Boots.The stock, up 3.25 per cent to close at $66.40, stood out among the risers in the S&P 500.The company’s second-quarter sales rose 5.1 per cent to a record $19.6bn, as like-for-like sales increased 4.3 per cent and cost savings from its partnership with Boots reached about $236m in the first half of its fiscal year.Investors were encouraged by indications of progress despite second-quarter profits being below expectations, with adjusted net earnings of $880m, or 91 cents per share, down from 96 cents per share a year ago.Analysts polled by Bloomberg had a mean estimate of 93 cents per share for the second quarter.Walgreens chief executive Greg Wasson said the performance “in spite of expected headwinds from slower generic drug introductions, comparisons with last year’s flu season and severe weather, was marked by solid top-line growth driven by record quarterly sales and record second-quarter prescriptions filled”.Walgreens struck a transatlantic deal to acquire 45 per cent of Boots for $6.5bn in cash and shares in 2012 with an option to buy the remaining 55 per cent next year for $9.3bn.Alliance Boots contributed 8 cents per diluted share to Walgreens’ second-quarter 2014 adjusted results, the company said, and estimated that would rise to 13 to 14 cents per diluted share in the third quarter.Elsewhere in the retail sector, American Apparel shares tumbled almost 22 per cent after announcing a $30.5m stock offering as its chosen strategy for meeting an April interest payment on its debt.The struggling clothier said it had begun an underwritten public offering of its common stock, with the proceeds being used to fund working capital and for general corporate purposes, including its interest payment due on senior secured notes.A payment is due on April 15 on its $206m 13 per cent senior secured notes due April 15 2020.American Apparel has been struggling to retain its listing on the New York Stock Exchange during its refinancing efforts and the Los Angeles-based company has said it will file its annual report late.It is granting the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to $4.6m of additional shares to cover over-allotments, if any.Roth Capital Partners is acting as sole book-running manager and Brean Capital is acting as co-manager for the offering.American Apparel is known for its fashion appeal to teenagers, unconventional advertising and practice of making its clothes in Los Angeles’ garment district rather than in Asia.Shares in Rackspace, the web hosting company, rose by 3.45 per cent to end at $33.85 after Morgan Stanley raised its rating to “overweight” from “equal weight,” saying the company would soon stabilise or accelerate sales growth as it focuses on cloud software.That helped reverse some of the painful 36 per cent slide in the shares over the past year.Analyst Simon Flannery said he believed that “a combination of strong execution, and clarity around CEO succession in coming quarters should help restore investor confidence”.Rackspace lagged behind the overall tech sector throughout the past year, falling 20 per cent in February when the company announced its chief executive would leave the company.Mr Flannery said the company had already recorded some improvement after Rackspace tallied 15.6 per cent sales growth in the fourth quarter, roughly the same pace recorded a quarter earlier.Nonetheless, the brisk growth rate has slowed from 2011 and 2012, when revenue gains frequently topped 30 per cent and the company’s market capitalisation hovered above $10bn.“It is still early stages in this execution turnround, but the company has begun to see improvements,” Mr Flannery said.“We believe the next step in this turnround will be an improvement in the installed base growth metric, which has been volatile in 2013 due to the focus on migrating to OpenStack.”Shares in Carnival fell 4.71 per cent to $38.63 after the world’s largest cruise operator forecast a full-year profit below analysts’ estimates as the company cuts prices to attract customers.After trying, and failing, to head higher over the previous two days, US equities overall moved slightly upwards.The S&P 500, which opened higher on both Friday and Monday before trading lower, edged up 0.44 per cent on the day to close at 1,865.62.Market players pointed to rising expectations of stimulus in China, as well as rising consumer confidence in the US.Traders have also calmed on ongoing tension in Crimea, even as leaders from the Group of 7 countries agreed to suspend Russia from the G8.Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the benchmark index was stuck in a “tactical rut” while those at RBC Capital Markets said momentum did not yet support a rebound.“US equity indexes continue to churn at, or just below, their 2013 highs but the more important technical story continues to be that of a rapid rotation from growth leadership to value laggards,” RBC’s Robert Sluymer said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.56 per cent to end at 16,367.88 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was 0.19 per

89;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2014-02-16T18:15:42Z;UK’s top retailers speak out against Scottish independence;;The UK’s largest retailers have voiced overwhelmingly hostile views about Scottish independence and the impact it could have on their businesses.The 33 top retail chairmen are understood to have been “consistently negative” when asked about Scottish first minister Alex Salmond’s plan for independence in a survey by headhunter Korn Ferry and the British Retail Consortium.Chairmen expressed their opinions on Scotland’s future ahead of this autumn’s referendum in interviews for Korn Ferry’s annual survey, though there was no formal question on the issue.They voiced concern about a rise in costs in the supply chain and that new employment and pension laws would create extra administration, which could lead to higher costs for consumers.Senior executives of three of Britain’s biggest supermarket chains told the Financial Times in December that a “yes” vote would lead to higher food prices in their Scottish stores– an assertion challenged by the Scottish National party.The Scottish government said supermarkets operated in competition with each other, and if one had higher prices then its competitors would not be slow to take advantage.Korn Ferry interviewed chairmen representing 39 companies and 44 per cent of all retail sales in the UK, worth £141bn a year.They included heads of the 10 largest retailers, including Sir Richard Broadbent of Tesco, David Tyler of J Sainsbury, Stefano Pessina of Alliance Boots and Robert Swannell of Marks and Spencer.Burberry’s Sir John Peace, Sir Stuart Rose of Ocado, Sir Charlie Mayfield of the John Lewis Partnership and Next’s John Barton, were among other chairmen questioned.Businesses have so far been reluctant to join the debate about independence, but some are starting to break their silence. BP’s chief executive Bob Dudley warned this month of “big uncertainties” facing the energy sector if Scotland votes for independence.But Ross McEwan, Royal Bank of Scotland’s chief executive, last week played down the risk for the bank and said it could adapt to ensure it continued doing business on both sides of the border.Opinion polls show the “yes” camp gaining ground slightly ahead of the vote on breaking the 300-year-old union, though still well short of a majority.A retail insider said: “There are a lot of unanswered questions around employment law, pensions law, borders, transport and the key questions of the currency and Europe are now on the table. Retailers will start feeling a lot more comfortable if they start getting some solid answers.”Scotland will decide in a referendum to be held on September 18 2014 whether or not to end the 306-year-old union with EnglandThe insider added: “I think there is widespread concern that, for example, there was nothing about retail in the Scottish government’s white paper and it’s such an important part of the Scottish economy.”Gordon MacIntyre-Kemp, chief executive of Business for Scotland, a pro-independence group, told the FT this month that a reformed Scottish tax system could mean lower prices for shoppers. He said while distribution costs might be higher, Scotland’s land and labour costs were lower.“There are opportunities for retailers to maintain or cut costs and maintain profitability,” he said.Helen Dickinson, director-general of the British Retail Consortium, said: “The decision on independence is ultimately one for the electorate. However, the SRC [Scottish Retail Consortium] is watching the debate closely.“We are working with our members to ensure retailers understand the implications for their business, supply chain, staff and customers.“Irrespective of the referendum, the SRC continues to campaign for the best possible business environment, recognising that consumers and the wider economy are best served when governments provide certainty, keep a tight lid on costs impacting on retailers such as taxes, charges and regulation, and when they improve logistical connectivity between Scotland and the rest of the UK.”
90;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Alliance Boots sees focus turning to debt deals;;Alliance Boots, the pharmacy company that underwent a £12bn leveraged buyout in 2007, has long faced hostility from campaigners over the erosion of its tax bills by debt. Now its critics are trying to increase the pressure by turning the spotlight on to deals undertaken in the aftermath of the financial crisis.The issue revolves around an attempt to capture an expected uplift in the price of the company’s debt, following its sharp fall in the wake of the banking crisis.Starting at the end of 2009, two Irish companies – set up by a Luxembourg finance company owned by Alliance Boots’ executive chairman Stefano Pessina– acquired £226m of the group’s senior and subordinated facilities loans.The purchase was largely funded as a result of Alliance Boots acquiring profit participating notes issued by the Irish companies. These notes were eventually redeemed during the year ended March 2013 and Alliance Boots bought back its loans from the Irish companies for £247m in March 2013.War on Want, a campaign group, has raised questions over two issues. Firstly, it asked whether the bulk of the profit from buying back the Alliance Boots debt went to Pessina-controlled entities, rather than the company itself.Secondly, it asked whether the involvement of Dascoli, Mr Pessina’s Luxembourg-based finance company, meant that the UK received less tax revenue on the profits from the deal that it would have done if the transaction had been structured in a different way.According to War on Want: “Alliance Boots shifted profits abroad, by using complex financial instruments, shell financial companies in Luxembourg, and payments from one party to finance the purchase of company debt in a circular manner that may have benefited those connected with the Luxembourg-based finance companies.”The company vigorously rejects the allegations and said it complied with all laws. It said: “Alliance Boots categorically refutes these allegations, which are inaccurate and we believe defamatory, and it is taking legal advice on this matter. The group practices strong corporate governance with full transparency in its financial disclosures which are contained in its annual report.”It is understood that the deal was put together by Alliance Boots because – unlike its regular debt – the terms of its banking facility meant it was not permitted to buy back mezzanine debt.The deal was put together with a related party – Dascoli, a Luxembourg-based finance company set up by Mr Pessina – but in such a way that Alliance Boots was able to benefit from the transaction through the profit participating loans. KKR, the private equity group, was the other shareholder at the time the transactions were put together.Alliance Boots is also understood to reject claims that the deal was designed to minimise its tax obligations. It made a full disclosure of the transactions to HMRC.War on Want admits the publicly available information on the transactions is inadequate to draw firm conclusions.It said: “These bare-bones disclosures do not provide the public and stakeholders with enough information to gauge the extent to which a management insider may have profited from self-dealing and tax avoidance through related-party transactions. Nor is it possible from these disclosures to assess whether the company has sufficient corporate governance measures in place.”But it wants to use a complaint lodged with the Paris-based OECD concerning the company’s adherence to its guidelines for multinational enterprises to put pressure on it to become more transparent.Alliance Boots vigorously rejects the criticism, insisting it goes far beyond the required standards. It says its annual report demonstrates “our desire and commitment to be at the forefront of best practice corporate governance reporting” and goes beyond the minimum standards set out for private equity firms.
91;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-11-28T00:01:14Z;Alliance Boots under pressure on tax bill;;Alliance Boots, which owns one of the UK’s oldest and most trusted high street brands, has come under fresh pressure from campaigners over how much tax it pays.The claims are the latest allegations aimed at reinforcing public anger that large companies can use complex arrangements to minimise their tax bills within the law.Two organisations – War on Want and Change to Win – said the way Alliance Boots handled deals between the company and entities controlled by Stefano Pessina, its executive chairman, broke OECD guidelines.Their target is a set of transactions involving a Luxembourg-based finance company, Dascoli. In the first of these moves, Dascoli bought more than £220m of Alliance Boots’ debt when it was trading at deep discounts to its par value.The organisations said that when Alliance Boots repurchased the debt in 2013, most of the benefit of its rise in value could have gone to entities controlled by Mr Pessina. The transactions “were structured in such a way that they may have significantly enriched those connected with the entities at the expense of the company and taxpayers”, the organisations said.Alliance Boots rejected the claims, calling them “inaccurate and, we believe, defamatory”.It said it complied strictly with the law, had strong corporate governance standards and fully transparent financial disclosures in its annual reports. “We …always strive to maintain the highest ethical standards.”The group has previously been explicit about buying back debt from distressed sellers when it could do so at a steep discount, in order to reduce its high borrowings.This is the second time within two months that Alliance Boots – which opened its first store selling herbal remedies in Nottingham in 1849 and is now 45 per cent owned by US pharmacy group Walgreens – has come under fire from campaigners.Alliance Boots has all the characteristics a tax campaigner could ask for in a target. It is a trusted healthcare retailer, founded, like Cadbury, by philanthropic Victorians. But in its modern incarnation it is a tax-savvy group, which was purchased for £12bn in 2007 by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and entrepreneur Stefano Pessina, writes Jonathan Guthrie.Continue readingUnite, Britain’s biggest trade union, said in October that the chain had “avoided paying more than £1bn in taxes” since it was taken private by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Mr Pessina in a £12bn deal in 2007. Alliance Boots said it observed the highest standards of ethics and had invested more than £2.1bn to build its business and contributed £1bn to its pension fund.Private equity groups typically use debt to finance their acquisitions to lower their cost of capital and get the tax benefit associated with debt to maximise their returns.The OECD guidelines were strengthened in 2011 and, even though they are voluntary, some non-governmental organisations see them as an effective way to hold companies to account.In this instance, the organisations said Alliance Boots breached the guidance by providing too little information for outside stakeholders to judge whether the transactions were fair and transparent. They also said that moving profit to tax havens went against the spirit of the UK tax regime.War on Want and Change to Win said they stood by their complaint, which would fall to the UK business department to investigate.

It is a trusted healthcare retailer, founded, like Cadbury, by philanthropic Victorians. But in its modern incarnation it is a tax-savvy group, which was purchased for £12bn in 2007 by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and entrepreneur Stefano Pessina.War on Want is the latest righter of perceived wrongs attracted by the contrast. The charity alleges that “entities apparently controlled by Mr Pessina have achieved exceptionally profitable results” from offshore transactions.AB “categorically refutes” the claims, which it says are defamatory. Sadly for the group, Britons are now predisposed to believe the worst of businesses. The syndrome was illustrated last year by Starbucks, forced to pay £20m in tax it did not owe to placate politicians disturbed by its transfer pricing arrangements.The bone of contention between AB and WoW is a debt buyback. According to the charity and US affiliate Change to Win, businesses linked to Mr Pessina bought £257m of the pharmacy group’s loans in 2009-2012. From 2010, AB allegedly started buying hybrid securities from companies associated with Mr Pessina.The transactions looked oddly circular to the charities. The market value of equivalent corporate debt had jumped by the time AB repurchased one chunk of loans, they say.People close to the company riposte that AB received the bulk of the value of well-timed debt repurchases. Mr Pessina, a multi-billionaire who made only “a small profit”, was enlisted as an agent because loan covenants prohibited AB from buying directly, the people add.The Department for Business will arbitrate on a complaint brought by the campaigners. But before then, AB and Mr Pessina should bolster their cause by disclosing how returns were distributed.Encompassing the globeThe UK may not produce tech giants to rival Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter.

Cable: Nonsense, young man. I set out the situation in terms even backbenchers could understand. The price will stabilise.
R: When?
C: The sooner the better, from my point of view. RBC sees the stock collapsing to 50p.
R: You’re trying to talk down the price of a business in which the government holds a 30 per cent stake? You previously dismissed a 570p valuation from Panmure Gordon as “an outlier”. The results have lifted the shares 6.5 per cent to 568p.
C: Share valuations turn out to be tricky*.
R: People might say this shows making business decisions is always harder than criticising those responsible. Yet your fans admire the robustness with which you deal with the “spivs” of the City, as you once denominated them. Will you pay Goldman Sachs and UBS their £4m performance fee?
C: The question will be the subject of detailed consultation at a later date.
R: Isn’t that the kind of flannel we hear from under-pressure business executives, who you now somewhat resemble?
C: If it works for them, it could work for me. Sir, I bid you Good Day.

93;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-10-15T23:03:32Z;Employers urged to amend job application forms to help ex-offenders;;Employers are being urged to remove the criminal record disclosure tick box from job application forms in an attempt to tackle discrimination against ex-offenders seeking employment.The Ban the Box campaign will ask employers to assess job seekers on their skills and abilities first, and not to exclude them because of an unrelated conviction.One in five people in the UK, or 9.2m people, have criminal records and research shows that three-quarters of employers admit to discriminating against such applicants, blocking millions from employment.Business in the Community, a charity backed by many of Britain’s largest companies and that has Prince Charles as its president, is behind the campaign. Alliance Boots, the pharmacy group that employs 70,000 in the UK, is playing a leading role.Ban the Box says employers can request disclosure of unspent criminal convictions as required later on in the application process. It aims to help more ex-offenders access work and also reduce the estimated £11bn annual cost of reoffending. BITC says employment has been proven to reduce the likelihood of reoffending by up to 50 per cent.Marco Pagni, group legal counsel at Alliance Boots, said that on visiting prisons two years ago, he was moved by the plight of people who had been punished for making a mistake, but faced discrimination when trying to reintegrate into society.Alliance Boots is removing the tick box from its written documents and online application forms. So far, it employs only 10 ex-offenders that it knows about, but expects the figure to rise as the tick box is removed.Some ex-offenders work in its warehousing and distribution operations while others are in planning roles at company headquarters. One recruit had served time for dangerous driving after killing someone in a car accident.“The whole idea is to give people a fair shot at jobs and not unfairly penalise them because of the fact that they have spent some time in jail,” Mr Pagni said. “They have served their debt to society through the prison sentence and they are genuinely trying to reintegrate themselves into the community through finding stable work.”True Story, a Nottinghamshire design agency that employs 80 people, is also taking part. It has never had a tick box policy, but is providing interview training to prisoners who are about to be released and plans to take some ex-offenders on work experience.“We want to help to create a level playing field for people who want to get back into work,” says Jayne Mayled, chief executive.Edwina Hughes, campaign manager at BITC, said Ban the Box was about challenging the perception that people with unspent convictions bring exceptional risk as employees. “Using the blunt instrument of a tick box, employers reject passionate, skilled employees,” she said.That could range from anyone who has received a £300 fine for a driving offence and will have to tick the box for five years, to someone with a prison sentence of more than two and a half years who has to tick the box for the rest of their life.In the past 10 years, no progress has been made on stopping this discrimination in the UK, Ms Hughes said.The campaign was inspired by a US scheme that focused on changing legislation at local and state level to ensure city councils and those that hold contracts with them do not request criminal conviction information at the point of application.In the city of Minneapolis this resulted in the hiring of 57.4 per cent of applicants with convictions dating from the past seven years in 2007-08, compared with 5.7 per cent hired in 2004-06.‘I wasn’t hearing back from employers’Daley, aged 30, began offending at 11 and has been in prison five times. Since he won a trainee post at Camden Garden Centre in north London two years ago, he has not reoffended, writes Brian Groom.But that job was with a company that specifically employs ex-offenders and his contract runs out in three months’ time. He fears discrimination when he looks for another job. “When I came out of prison I wanted to do something different and work,” he says. “I started filling in applications and I was ticking the box [declaring unspent convictions] and I wasn’t hearing back from employers.”The garden centre has taught him skills including customer service, landscaping and stock checking. He has learnt the discipline of getting up at 6am to travel to work, where previously he slept until 1pm or 2pm. He has even moved from Kilburn to Surrey to break with his previous lifestyle and friends. “Two of them have gone back to prison for a very long time. They never managed to find employment so I guess they just reverted to what they knew best.”Daley would love to work in a gym, but has had no replies from gym owners. He is hoping to find a job at Marks and Spencer, which has a programme for employing disadvantaged groups, and he will try other employers too.“I think it’s really unfair,” he says. “You should be given the opportunity to talk to an employer face-to-face and explain your situation and how you have changed and what you can bring to the job.”
94;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-10-14T23:45:10Z;Unite intensifies fight over corporate tax avoidance;;Britain’s biggest trade union has stepped up its campaign against private equity groups’ efforts to limit corporate taxes, in a report targeting Alliance Boots.The British pharmacy chain, which shifted its headquarters to Zug, Switzerland in 2008, has “avoided paying more than £1bn in taxes” since KKR took it private six years ago in a £12bn leveraged buyout, Unite said in the report, to be published on Tuesday.The union calculated that Alliance Boots was able to do this largely because it is allowed to deduct interest payments on the £9bn debt taken on to fund its buyout. Unite is calling for “a reform of the tax laws governing the treatment of debt and equity,” which currently encourages use of debt.“The company went into massive debt to fund its 2007 buyout and is likely to have apportioned this liability to reduce its corporation tax by about 95 per cent,” the report says. It points out that the company derives part of its UK revenues from prescriptions and related services that are “mainly paid for by the UK’s taxpayer-funded National Health Service”.Alliance Boots said it invested more than £2.1bn to build its business and has contributed £1bn to its pension funds.“Alliance Boots conducts its business and organises its tax affairs strictly in compliance with all applicable law (including legislation in the UK) and observes the highest standard of good ethics,” it said in a statement.Private equity groups have sought to benefit from the tax deductibility of interest payments – an arrangement available to all companies – more actively than other types of investors. They typically use more debt than their own equity to finance their acquisitions in order to lower their cost of capital and get the tax benefit associated with debt to maximise their returns.An analysis by the Financial Times in June showed that Alliance Boots had accumulated a tax credit on £5bn of profit in the past six years, and that other private equity-backed companies were able to pay less corporation tax than rivals that were less-leveraged.At the time, a spokesman for the Treasury said the government had no intention of questioning the tax deductibility of interest payments.On Tuesday, the British Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (BVCA) reiterated that the arrangement was part of a tax regime allowing companies to be more competitive.“Why put the boot in to Boots when it is doing so much for Britain? Under private equity ownership, Boots has added stores and jobs thanks to significant investment,” said Tim Hames, BVCA director-general. “Our portfolio companies are simply benefiting, as all businesses are, from the increased competitiveness of our corporate tax regime.”
95;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-08-06T19:43:25Z;Zero-hours work kept down dole queues, says CBI;;The UK’s dole queues would have topped 3m during the recession had it not been for zero-hour contracts, the CBI said on Tuesday as it mounted a defence against the “demonisation” of flexible working.John Cridland, director-general of the business lobby, said those complaining about such contracts needed a “reality check” in the wake of revelations about the growing use of contracts with no guaranteed hours.“These contracts play a vital role as a way of keeping people in employment,” said the head of the employers’ body. “If we hadn’t had this flexible working when the economy contracted, unemployment would have topped 3m – and it didn’t it went to 2.5m.”The Institute of Directors said criticism of zero-hours contracts “misses the point entirely”.As business groups fought back, Labour stepped up its scrutiny of the practice on Tuesday as it released research showing that many workers wanted more hours from their employers. The opposition party, which will hold a summit this month to discuss how to tackle the zero-hours trend, said the contracts were feeding an “underemployment crisis” among families struggling to cope with rising living costs.Research released this week by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development claimed there were about 1m zero-hours workers in the UK – four times the official estimate.Mark Beatson, chief economist at the CIPD, said it was too simplistic to dismiss such contracts as bad for the labour market or the tool of greedy private sector employers. He noted that zero-hours contracts were also used heavily across the voluntary and public sectors.“It is a more nuanced debate …It is about [employers] having a range of options … and zero hours has got to be seen as part of a menu,” said Mr Beatson. “At certain times of the business cycle certain parts of the menu will be used more widely.”Within the private sector, pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hotels are some of the heavier users of zero-hour contracts as managers try to trim their wage bill in the face of volatile demand. Nearly all McDonald’s staff are on these contracts while JD Wetherspoon, the 800-strong pub group, also use such employment methods. Cineworld also employs the bulk of their staff – part-time workers and students – on zero-hours.In the retail sector, use is more patchy: Sports Direct uses these contracts for their entire workforce while Alliance Boots, the private equity-owned high street chemist and retailer, has a few thousand staff on zero-hours. The retailer said zero-hours deals suited parents who wanted to fit working around school drop offs and older workers not ready to retire. Supermarkets do not use zero-hours arrangements, preferring instead to use contracts that stipulate a minimum number of hours.Vince Cable, business secretary, this week ruled out an outright ban on zero-hours contracts which he believes “can work for the worker as well as the employer”. But he said rule changes might be needed in cases where workers on zero hours contracts were prevented from taking on work with another employer. “If that’s happening clearly an abuse is taking place.”
96;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-06-18T11:04:08Z;Osborne, the G8, tax transparency and high street retailers;;George Osborne this morning raised hopes of an imminent G8 deal on a new tax “register” showing the ownership structure of companies, as I report on ft.com this morning.The UK hopes to “lead the way” on transparency by creating a central register of company ownership – although it may only be available to the tax authorities rather than the general public.By getting a deal on “beneficial ownership”, the chancellor – and prime minister David Cameron – hope to emerge from the G8 gathering in Northern Ireland with a tangible result on tax avoidance.The Treasury is acutely aware that large numbers of the tax havens which have attracted global opprobrium are, ahem, governed from London. (The first minister of Anguilla, a tiny Caribbean haven, told me last week that he viewed the City of London as the biggest money-laundering centre in the world.)The issue of tax is never straightforward. And the focus on offshore jurisdictions is not the only one that politicians have to address. This story in today’s FT on private equity companies – and their tax rates – today is a reminder of that.My colleague Anne-Sylvaine Chassiny has carried out new research into the relative tax advantage enjoyed by private equity-owned companies – including some major high street brands.First among them is Alliance Boots, which has accumulated a tax credit on £5bn of profit in the past six years, prompting criticism from MPs and unions.The analysis found that private-equity backed businesses – including Alliance Boots, New Look and Odeon – have been able to pay less tax than their listed competitors partly by deducting debt interest payments from their tax bills.The FT study, which is not exhaustive, aggregated the amounts of corporation tax paid over the past six years by nine UK private equity-owned consumer brands, and compared them with their closest listed competitors whenever possible, using public data.Alliance Boots, the pharmacy chain owned by New York private equity investor KKR, has, for example, had accumulated an accounting tax benefit of £132m since 2007, while generating £5.2bn in operating profit in the period, and £109bn in revenues.The analysis underscores how private equity groups tend to exploit tax advantages more actively than other companies. Using loans to help finance their acquisitions, they have become one of the biggest beneficiaries of the tax deductibility of interest payments – an arrangement available to all companies.Margaret Hodge, chair of the parliamentary public accounts committee, said: “While one accepts the onus is on government to set the rules, for as long as corporations, private equity, accountants and lawyers continue to believe that minimising tax in an aggressive way is legitimate, we will keep encountering these horror stories.”Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, had bitter rows with Gordon Brown at the time of the £12bn leveraged buyout of Alliance Boots, urging the then Labour prime minister to end the tax advantage given to companies with large borrowings.Mr Kenny told me this week: “Not only has it eroded the tax base as this analysis shows but it has also distorted the economy. What has happened with Boots is a disgrace.”Anne-Sylvaine reports that New Look, Iglo, the frozen foodmaker, and Merlin Entertainment, which operates the London Eye, are all owned by private equity fund managers and have paid less than 11 per cent of their operating profits in corporate taxes since 2007 on a cumulative basis.New Look, jointly owned by Apax and Permira since 2004, paid £22.6m, or 3 per cent of operating profit in taxes between 2007 and 2013, according to Companies House filings. The company says it paid taxes of £62.5m, or 8.5 per cent of operating profit, and less than 1 per cent of sales.Next, the UK listed clothing retailer, has paid 25 per cent of operating profit and 4 per cent of sales in taxes in the same period.Odeon has paid £22.2m in taxes, or 4 per cent of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and 1 per cent of sales, since 2007. Cineworld, half the size of Odeon by revenues, paid £34m in taxes, or 10 per cent of its ebitda and 2 per cent of its sales in the same period.Merlin, the world’s second-largest theme park company, owned by Blackstone and CVC Capital Partners, has paid about 11 per cent of operating profit in taxes since 2007. Listed leisure group Whitbread, meanwhile, paid 22 per cent of operating profit in taxes.Iglo, owned by Permira, has paid €39m in taxes since 2007, or about 4 per cent of operating profit.The question therefore for Mr Osborne is: Why can’t you do anything about this – given that Germany, the Netherlands and France have moved towards restricting the tax deductability of interest payments.The answer is that the coalition still buys into the argument that this tax break enables investment, jobs and growth.A Treasury spokesperson said the government remains committed to interest deductibility, adding: “The current rules are considered by businesses to be a competitive advantage for the UK, this advantage outweighs potential benefits from moving towards a more territorial system for interest.”
97;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Anger at Alliance Boots tax breaks;;Alliance Boots has accumulated a tax credit on £5bn of profit in the past six years, prompting calls by unions and MPs for an overhaul of the tax advantages enjoyed by private equity.The revelation came from an analysis by the Financial Times of the corporation taxes paid by some of Britain’s best-known brands under private equity control.The analysis found that private-equity backed businesses – including Alliance Boots, New Look and Odeon – have been able to pay less tax than their listed competitors partly by deducting debt interest payments from their tax bills.The FT study, which is not exhaustive, aggregated the amounts of corporation tax paid over the past six years by nine UK private equity-owned consumer brands, and compared them with their closest listed competitors whenever possible, using public data.Alliance Boots, the pharmacy chain owned by New York private equity investor KKR, has, for example, had accumulated an accounting tax benefit of £132m since 2007, while generating £5.2bn in operating profit in the period, and £109bn in revenues.The analysis underscores how private equity groups tend to exploit tax advantages more actively than other companies. Using loans to help finance their acquisitions, they have become one of the biggest beneficiaries of the tax deductibility of interest payments – an arrangement available to all companies.But as G8 countries are meeting in Northern Ireland this week with taxes high on the agenda, some are arguing taxpayers’ money should not subsidise private equity returns.Commenting on the findings of the analysis, Margaret Hodge, chair of the parliamentary public accounts committee, said: “While one accepts the onus is on government to set the rules, for as long as corporations, private equity, accountants and lawyers continue to believe that minimising tax in an aggressive way is legitimate, we will keep encountering these horror stories.”Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, had bitter rows with Gordon Brown at the time of the £12bn leveraged buyout of Alliance Boots, urging the then Labour prime minister to end the tax advantage given to companies with large borrowings. Mr Kenny said: “Not only has it eroded the tax base as this analysis shows but it has also distorted the economy. What has happened with Boots is a disgrace.”After the financial crisis, Germany, the Netherlands and France have restricted or are planning to restrict the use of the deductibility of interest payments, directly targeting leveraged buyouts. These moves have given the UK a competitive advantage the government is happy to keep intact.A Treasury spokesperson said the government remains committed to interest deductibility, adding: “The current rules are considered by businesses to be a competitive advantage for the UK, this advantage outweighs potential benefits from moving towards a more territorial system for interest.”Additional reporting by Andrew Bounds
98;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-05-15T17:54:14Z;Alliance Boots chief defends tax payments;;Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, defended the amount of tax paid by the retailer and pharmaceutical wholesaler, as the company unveiled a 22 per cent rise in full-year pre-tax profit, despite falling sales.“We are much more than a cash cow . . . we are a kind of whale for the government,” Mr Pessina said.George Fairweather, finance director, said Alliance Boots paid tax of £114m in the year to March 31, up £31m on the year earlier period.It paid £64m of corporation tax in the UK, a year-on-year increase of £38m.However, Mr Fairweather said that if corporation tax, business rates and employers’ national insurance contributions were included, then the group paid more than £300m of tax a year.“Rates is by far the biggest element. Corporation tax is a modest part of the total,” he said.Alliance Boots, which is resident in Switzerland, has in the past come under fire from tax protest groups, including UK Uncut.Mr Pessina has said that it is factors such as the reduction in corporation tax, and tax relief on contributions to its UK pension funds that lower the tax bill, rather than the Swiss residency.He also said on Wednesday that Alliance Boots now paid more tax than Boots had in its final years as a publicly listed company.“Boots was paying less tax every year because of course they had some problems. Now we are paying substantially more tax,” he said.The comments came as Alliance Boots, which last year sold a 45 per cent stake to US pharmacy group Walgreens, increased pre-tax profit from £688m to £837m, although sales fell from £23bn to £22.4bn, as it was hit by adverse currency movements.Alliance Boots, which was taken private by Mr Pessina and private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in a £12bn deal in 2007, cut net debt by £1.1bn to £5.9bn, after the group generated cash of £1.65bn.UK dispensing revenue was hit by several key branded medicines coming off of patent protection and being substituted by lower priced generic drugs. UK like-for-like sales fell by 0.7 per cent, mainly due to calendar impacts, with demand continuing for premium beauty products and Boots’ No 7 range.Mr Pessina said there were some signs of improvement in UK retail conditions.“If we look just at the last months, we see a slight trend upwards,” he said.Mr Pessina said 2012/13 had been a “truly transformation year” for the group. However, he was still keen to pursue more deals, with China and Latin America his top priorities.“Definitely we are looking for other investments in China, and other partnerships,” he said.
99;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-05-06T11:46:34Z;Alliance Boots aims to be in the vanguard of China consolidation;;Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, is looking to China for his next big deal, nine months after completing the multibillion pound sale of a stake in the retailer and pharmaceutical wholesaler to Walgreens.Just a few weeks after striking the deal with Walgreens, which could eventually see the US pharmacy chain acquire the whole of the group for £10bn, Alliance Boots bought a minority stake in Nanjing Pharmaceutical, China’s fifth largest pharmaceutical wholesaler by sales. Alliance Boots already owns 50 per cent of Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals, China’s sixth largest pharmaceutical wholesaler.But Mr Pessina forecasts further consolidation in China, the world’s third biggest pharmaceutical market, and wants Alliance Boots to be at the forefront of this activity.“It’s clear that we are number one in Europe, we are now number one in the US. We want to be either say number one, [or] at least number two or number three in China . . . Why not number one over time?” he told the Financial Times.“We cannot create a global company without being in Europe and in the US and in Asia, particularly in China,” he added. “We are definitely now well established in Europe, well established in the US, even though most of the work is still there to be done . . . But in the meantime we have to prepare the basis for our future expansions.“China is not the only country. There are other countries which are also interesting and probably necessary for a truly global company. But China is the most important,” he said.A deal in China could also take time to come to fruition, leaving scope for smaller infill acquisitions or partnerships in the meantime. He would like any further consolidation to involve the company’s existing Chinese partners.Mr Pessina is also looking to the second phase of the deal with Walgreens, which could come to fruition in about two years’ time.The first stage saw the US group acquire 45 per cent of Alliance Boots for about $6.5bn from Mr Pessina and KKR who had taken the group private in a £12bn buyout in 2007.In the second, Walgreens has the option to acquire the remaining 55 per cent for about $9.5bn in cash and shares, plus assuming the outstanding debt.Mr Pessina said he was confident the second phase would go ahead. However, he played down the prospect of Walgreens establishing a secondary listing in London in the near future, to offer institutional investors access to Alliance Boots once more.However, he was cool about the prospect of Walgreens’ brands coming to the British high street.“The big prize is to sell Boots products in the US,” he said.
100;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Stefano Pessina has his eye on a global goal for Alliance Boots;;Less than a year after pulling off the deal of a lifetime – to sell the whole of privately owned Alliance Boots to Walgreens for about £10bn– Stefano Pessina is already on the hunt for his next big transaction.The 71-year-old executive chairman of Alliance Boots is keen to make acquisitions or strike partnerships to complete his plan of transforming Alliance Boots, taken private by Mr Pessina and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2007, into a truly global pharmaceutical wholesaler and retailer.“We will go back to our pipeline and we will try to extract the most mature fruits,” he says.Given Alliance Boots’ £23bn of sales, he is interested only in big markets, and for him, China, the world’s third largest pharmaceutical market, is the most important. A deal in China would not be the last piece of the jigsaw, but “the next big piece”, he says.Last September, just weeks after Mr Pessina and KKR completed the sale of a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots to Walgreens, Mr Pessina announced an agreement to take a 12 per cent holding in Nanjing Pharmaceutical, the fifth largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in China by sales. Alliance Boots already owns 50 per cent of Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals, China’s sixth largest pharmaceutical wholesaler, and has had a presence in the country for 10 years.But Mr Pessina expects further consolidation.“We are aware that it will take years and years. We are also aware that we have to work on it,” he says. “We can work for today, but we can work also for tomorrow. [With] China, it’s working for tomorrow.”Working for today is making the most of the transatlantic tie-up with Walgreens. Under the first phase of the deal, Walgreens acquired a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots for about $6.5bn in cash and shares. It has the option to buy the remaining 55 per cent in two years’ time for about $9.5bn.Already the two companies are jointly buying in areas of scale, including generic drugs and goods not for resale. They are also preparing for the launch of Boots products in Walgreens’ 8,000 stores, with trials in certain flagship locations.“We said that this year we will deliver between $100m and $150m of synergies and we will do it. We said in four years we will generate at least $1bn of synergies. We will do it. We will exceed it as usual,” he says.The economics have been further boosted by a second US deal, in March, for Walgreens and Alliance Boots to build a potential stake of up to 23 per cent in AmerisourceBergen, a pharmaceutical wholesaler. Walgreens also extended its existing drug-buying arrangement with Amerisource to a 10-year distribution agreement.Mr Pessina says the Amerisource accord brings the model, pioneered in the UK, of combining wholesale and retail, to the US, the world’s biggest pharmaceutical market, and could also hasten the adoption of this structure in China.He has also done well personally from the partial sale to Walgreens. He did not take any cash from the stake sale. Instead, he has aa holding of about 8 per cent in Walgreens. This was worth about £1.45bn at the time the deal was struck. An increase in the Walgreens share price has boosted this to about £2.3bn. If the second stage goes ahead, his holding could increase to about 20 per cent, worth about £6bn, depending on whether KKR elect to take shares or cash. He originally invested £1.2bn in the buyout of Alliance Boots.“I have not done a bad deal,” he acknowledges, adding that he will also take his consideration in shares in the second phase.He is confident that the second stage of the sale will go ahead. In the meantime, Alliance Boots must grapple with difficult conditions in many of its markets.Although, after five years of the global downturn, Mr Pessina has grown accustomed to this environment “every year of the crisis is more difficult, because of the sum of the effect of the previous years”.Conditions are worse in continental Europe than the US or UK.“In Europe, there are many countries where people are just spending their time complaining. Instead of thinking of the future, they are complaining of the past. They have all the right to complain about the past, but it’s not very productive,” he says.The management team has also been distracted by the year’s deals.Nevertheless, Alliance Boots is expected to show another year of double digit earnings growth.Net debt, which stood at £7bn in March 2012, will come down by “largely in excess” of the £500m annual reduction anticipated at the time of the Walgreens deal. The group throws off more than £1bn of cash a year.Alliance Boots has also extended the maturity on more than £5bn of this debt, by two to three years, to dates starting from 2016.Once again, no dividend was taken from the business by Mr Pessina or KKR.Although the second stage of the Walgreens deal would see it swallow Alliance Boots, as the largest shareholder, Mr Pessina would have considerable sway over the US giant with a £30bn market capitalisation.“I will probably have a certain influence,” he acknowledges. “But the influence is not due to the shares, the influence is due to the experience, and the value you can bring to the table. I believe for the time being at least I’m still able to think and to help, and to counsel them. But you know the day I felt I would not be able to be useful, I would retire. I would not stay just because I have shares.”
101;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-03-28T19:05:03Z;The lady doth protest too much;Laura Ashley joins ranks of retail’s tough negotiators;It must have felt a bit like being mugged by Angela Rippon. Laura Ashley, the chintzy frocks ‘n’ furnishings retailer, recently wrote to suppliers asking for a 10 per cent discount, even for orders that had already been placed. This was gazundering, as it is known in the housing market, only with blouses and bed linen rather than bijoux residences.The group, whose heyday was in the 1980s, thereby joined the ranks of retailers whose negotiating tactics can best be described as “robust”. They include Marks and Spencer, which requested a one-off contribution equivalent to 1.25 per cent of order value in 2011, and Alliance Boots, which imposed a 2.5 per cent “settlement fee” on its payments to suppliers in 2008.Laura Ashley had cited rising promotional costs and competition from online-only retailers as a reason for giving suppliers a short-back-and-sides. The instinct of at least one supplier was to check the company’s credit ratingBut the purveyor of togs and tables to Middle England’s matriarchs appears in rude good health, judging from its annual results. The company cited a 1.9 percentage point reduction in gross margin as an indicator of tough trading conditions. However, that represented a fall of 4.3 per cent, a lot less than the 10 per cent discount demanded from suppliers. Laura Ashley’s operating margin was flat at 6.4 per cent and pre-tax profits rose 7 per cent to £20.1m.With £34.6m of gross cash on the balance sheet, Laura Ashley is hardly a charity case.It isn’t very exciting. But you know where you are. National Grid has promised to pay dividends that rise at least in line with RPI inflation. That guarantee is a reasonable concession to risk-averse investors for reduced payout expectations. The energy distributor has typically returned cash to shareholders at a rate above the devaluation benchmark in recent years. Now, as it gears up to spend £35bn on infrastructure, it is at least putting a floor under the divvi.Not that everyone is happy. In a research note, Deutsche Bank raises questions about the sustainability of the policy. Analyst Martin Brough argues that new price controls will push down National Grid’s real post-tax return on capital to around 3.5 per cent by the end of this decade. That would squeeze the profits from which dividends are paid, putting pressure on National Grid to increase gearing, which currently stands at 59 per cent.National Grid demurs. As with so many aspects of utilities investment, the issue will be decided by the regulator.However, shares with explicit inflation-proofing should appeal to retail investors at a time when interest rates are historically low and the purchasing power of money is under threat. This month’s budget promised incoming Bank of England governor Mark Carney latitude to stoke inflation in the cause of growth, while simultaneously scotching hopes of new issues of savings certificates from National Savings, RPI-linked or otherwise.Financial institutions could shoulder onerous environmental obligations under a plan characterised as “reparations for the credit crunch” by European lawmakers. The move is likely to trigger protests from the City, already dismayed by plans to impose maximum ratios of bonus to salary on bankers.Under the Finance Offset Obligation Law, the environment directorate of the European Commission would make banks and fund managers responsible for specific conservation projects. The draft legislation, proposed by Netherlands MEP Joost Van Wyndap, a representative of the fringe Rainbow Alliance Party, has been greeted enthusiastically by greens and leftwingers.Mr Van Wyndap told Lombard that businesses would have financial liability for the eco-initiatives with which they were twinned Thus, Spanish bank Santander would be subject to a special levy if a programme to breed the rare Iberian lynx fell short of target.

102;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-03-20T18:30:14Z;Walgreen: empire building;Pharmacy chain must expand in new areas;How hard can it be to move a bunch of pills around? Hard. Pharma distribution is a big business because the inventory is expensive, comes in zillions of varieties and retailers can’t afford to be caught short. The three major US drug distributors – McKesson, Cardinal and AmerisourceBergen – have a combined value of more than $50bn.A 10-year distribution agreement between the largest retail pharmacy chain, Walgreen, and AmerisourceBergen was announced on Tuesday, and has a surprising feature. Walgreen and its partner Alliance Boots will have the right to buy 7 per cent of AmersourceBergen in the open market, and will be granted warrants, exercisable in 2016 and 2017, for another 16 per cent of the shares.The companies talk about the equity stake aligning the interests of the two sides and sharing in the value created by the deal. There is truth in this, but there are other ways to achieve those ends. Walgreen, it seems, is moving towards vertically integrating the pharma value chain in the US (at the same time as it tries to integrate European and US pharmacy retailing by buying a major stake in, and potentially all of, Alliance Boots).Walgreen’s rival CVS tried to integrate another part of the chain when it merged with the pharmacy benefit manager Caremark in 2006. PBMs negotiate prices with pharmacies on behalf of health plans, and the CVS-Caremark deal has raised questions of channel conflict – are health plans that do not use Caremark getting a fair deal from CVS? Do retailers other than CVS get a fair deal from Caremark? Whether similar conflicts will bedevil a Walgreen-owned distributor is hard to say. But like other retailers who already enjoy dominant positions in their core markets (Walmart comes to mind) Walgreen has little choice but to expand in new areas if it intends to keep growing.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
103;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Boots and Walgreens add to pharma empire;Pharma partners in deal with AmerisourceBergen;Alliance Boots and Walgreens have added another element to their health and pharmaceutical empire in a deal to buy more drugs from – and potentially take a stake in – AmerisourceBergen, a US drug wholesaler.The deal gives Walgreens and Alliance Boots the option to build a stake of up to 23 per cent in AmerisourceBergen, worth $2.5bn, an example of vertical integration with a retail pharmacy becoming part-owner of a drug wholesaler.Walgreens will expand its existing drug-buying arrangement with AmerisourceBergen to a 10-year distribution deal worth $28bn, while ending its current relationship with Cardinal Health, a rival wholesaler.In June last year, the companies announced that Walgreens would take a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots, which is privately owned, in a £10bn deal. Walgreens has an option to acquire the rest of the company in about two years.Walgreens shares rose 5.4 per cent to $44.74 after the wholesale deal was announced on Tuesday.Cardinal made 21 per cent of its sales to Walgreens last year and its shares fell 8.2 per cent on Tuesday to $42.35.The deal gives Walgreens and Alliance Boots the right to purchase up to 7 per cent of AmerisourceBergen in the open market, with associated board representation. They can buy another 16 per cent at a later date.AmerisourceBergen shares rose 3.6 per cent to $50.06 on Tuesday.Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, took the group private in 2007 in a £12bn deal. Last year’s stake sale to Walgreens followed a long search for a transaction or partnership with a retailer or a pharmaceutical wholesaler in the US.“We are Alliance Boots, but we are also Alliance Healthcare, and we understand something about the wholesale [business]. AmerisourceBergen is a company very similar to Alliance Healthcare,” Mr Pessina said on Tuesday.“It remains an independent company but the collaboration will be very strong. We have done this for many years. We look at partnerships and collaboration with other companies.”Mr Pessina has continued to strike deals since the partial sale to Walgreens, spending £56m in September to acquire a 12 per cent holding in Nanjing Pharmaceutical, the fifth-largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in China by sales.
104;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-03-19T15:13:23Z;Cyprus levy concerns weigh on US stocks;;Wall Street reversed early gains and closed mainly lower on Tuesday as fears over the imposition of a levy on bank deposits in Cyprus overshadowed positive US housing data which showed that home construction rose in February.The benchmark S&P 500 index settled 0.2 per cent lower at 1,548.34, pulling away from the near-record levels of last week when it was only two points shy of an all-time high last seen in October 2007.Volatility in the markets has also picked up. The CBOE Vix index, which measures implied volatility on the S&P 500 and is dubbed Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, has risen more than 25 per cent in the past two days, however it is still below long-term average levels.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip stocks and is a price-weighted index, closed a fraction higher at 14,455.82, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3 per cent to 3,229.09.“The situation in Cyprus has brought a lot of uncertainty to the markets, as now there are different possible outcomes after their parliament votes on the bailout package, but none of them are good,” said Channing Smith, an equity strategist at Capital Advisors.“If they go ahead with levying deposits, then potentially depositors in other countries will lose confidence in the system and could cause bank runs. Such turmoil is potentially very damaging to the rest of Europe, especially in the south,” he said.Earlier, housing starts figures were in line with expectations, but the upward trend indicates continued strength in the housing market. US homebuilders attracted buyers with the S&P 500 subgroup at one stage up nearly 2 per cent, before easing to a rise of 0.1 per cent. The index has increased almost fivefold since bottoming in 2008.PulteGroup shares rose 0.3 per cent to $20.82, while DR Horton rose 0.3 per cent to $24.31. KB Home shares rose 3 per cent to $21.03.In deal news Walgreens, the largest drugstore chain in the US, rallied after the company and its partner, Alliance Boots, agreed to buy a minority stake in Amerisource Bergen. Under the deal, Walgreens and Alliance Boots will distribute pharmaceutical products made by Amerisource Bergen for the next 10 years.Walgreens shares rose 5.4 per cent to $44.74 and have gained 20 per cent since the start of the year.Shares in Amerisource Bergen also rallied 3.6 per cent to $50.06 on the news.Cardinal Health shares suffered, dropping 8.2 per cent to $42.35 after the pharmaceutical company said its contract with Walgreens to distribute its products would not be renewed after expiring on August 1.Lululemon, the maker of athletic and yoga clothes, was hit after recalling one of its most popular items – black yoga pants – after discovering that they were see-through. The stock fell 2.8 per cent to $64.08 as analysts thought the recall would dent revenues in the first quarter.Electronic Arts shares fell 8.3 per cent to $17.15 after the second largest video game publisher by market value replaced chief executive officer John Riccitiello and warned that fourth-quarter profits could fall below expectations.Iron ore miners suffered after Goldman Sachs analysts cut the price forecast, citing seaborne expansion projects, increases in China’s domestic ore production and an escalation of steel recycling. The downgrade follows similar warnings from Deutsche Bank a few weeks before saying iron ore prices face headwinds because of slowing demand for steel in China as well as an abundance of scrap metal.Shares in Cliffs Natural Resources, miner and producer of iron ore, fell 6.6 per cent to $20.33. The company has lost nearly half its market value since the start of the year.Downgrades from investment banks hit some shares on the S&P 500 index. Kohl’s fell 4.1 per cent to $46.56 after Morgan Stanley cut it to underweight and reduced its price target.Juniper Networks fell 5.3 per cent to $19.14 after its rating was cut to “sell” by analysts at Goldman Sachs who said increased competition, especially in its data centre equipment and security business segment, would undermine profits.
105;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-03-03T18:56:34Z;KKR rejigs European dealmaking team;;KKR, the New York-based private equity group, is rejuvenating its team of European dealmakers as it seeks a fresh start before raising a new fund in the region for the first time since the financial crisis.KKR told investors at a meeting in Berlin last week that Jacques Garaialde, a French partner who joined in 2003, and Reinhard Gorenflos, a German partner who joined in 2001, would not take part in the next fund.The decision follows the promotion in December of two younger partners, Philipp Freise and Silke Scheiber. Mr Garaialde, 56, will become a senior adviser to the firm and Mr Gorenflos, 51, will commit to philanthropic work in Africa, according to KKR.The moves are part of a changing of the guard in European private equity, accelerated by five years of sluggish growth and weak deal flow. Johannes Huth, KKR’s chief in Europe, is clearing the path for a younger generation after his funds went through ups and down in the wake of the financial crash.KKR marked down the value of some of its largest deals in Europe by more than 90 per cent during the downturn, including German broadcaster ProSiebenSat. 1, Dutch chipmaker NXP and French phonebook publisher PagesJaunes, all in its second $5.8bn European fund, raised in 2005.The fund, which includes UK pharmacy chain Alliance Boots, is now posting a 26 per cent cumulative gain since being raised. KKR’s third European fund closed in 2008 – of $6.1bn – is returning an 18.5 per cent cumulative gain.Successful investments led by Mr Garaialde and Mr Gorenflos have lately been overshadowed by over-leveraged deals.Mr Garaialde led KKR’s investment in French directories company PagesJaunes. KKR, along with Goldman Sachs, bought a 54 stake in the company from France Telecom for E3.3bn in 2006, at the peak of the credit boom.Mr Gorenflos supervised the firm’s investment in German auto repair company ATU, which KKR had to mark down in 2008, after the company – bought for €1.45bn in 2004 – came close to breaching its debt covenants.“Over more than a decade, Jacques and Reinhard have been highly valuable members of the KKR Europe team,” Mr Huth said in a statement. “They will continue to be involved with the European III fund until the fund is fully invested and will remain close members of the KKR family.”KKR’s recent appointments of Mr Freise and Ms Scheiber also highlight a strong interest in the German market. In 2009, Mr Freise led the firm’s investment in BMG music rights venture, which he sold to co-investor Bertelsmann last week, making an annual return of about 20 per cent.Ms Scheiber, an Austrian national, conducted the investment in German cutlery maker WMF last year. Their appointments followed the nominations of Mattia Caprioli and Henrik Kraft as partners in the previous two years.
106;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-02-25T08:12:52Z;MasterCard moves into mobile payments;;MasterCard unveiled its long-awaited foray into the mobile payments market at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday.MasterPass, which will incorporate both a digital wallet for consumers and a mobile-friendly checkout for merchants online and in-store, signals a break from the US-based credit card company’s traditional branding.Although MasterCard has offered online payment services for years, these have revolved around its credit cards, with users having to fill out card numbers, expiry dates and security codes – a process most consumers are reluctant to carry out on their phones.Jorn Lambert of MasterCard Worldwide said the service would be available to consumers through financial institutions in Australia and Canada by the end of March, and in the US and UK in spring and summer respectively.“We are working with our partners to make sure everything hits at the same time. We don’t want people to register for wallets before they can actually use it,” he said.Launch partners will include UK high-street retailers Argos and Boots, and American Airlines in the US. BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, Citi, Swedbank, UniCredit and Westpac have all signed up to support the service.Mobile payments are a hot topic at the Mobile World Congress this year. Although the number of retail apps has exploded, revenues have yet to match the hype. Most retailers build their own payment systems, forcing consumers to register and enter their payment details separately.MasterPass includes a digital wallet – in effect an app – that allows consumers to keep all their payment and loyalty card details as well as shipping addresses on their phone. MasterCard says this will accept cards and payment systems from competitors.The second, more crucial, element of MasterPass is digital checkout services for merchants. This will appear online as a MasterPass payment option – much like Visa, MasterCard and PayPal do now – or as a barcode-like QR code on items in stores, which customers can scan and pay for instantly.Mr Lambert said the strength of the new platform was that it could incorporate services such as loyalty discounts, based on location or purchase history.“The great thing about the phone is it’s an interactive device – let’s make sure we take full advantage of that and not just do what a plastic card can do. If a retailer wants to offer discounts or loyalty points as part of the transaction, that can happen.”The company says it expects all vendors who accept MasterCard to adopt the new system within two years.“There is no website today that doesn’t accept MasterCard and there will be no website that does not accept MasterPass in a while,” Mr Lambert said.MasterCard faces plenty of competition in mobile payments, with Visa expected to make further announcements about V.me, its upcoming digital wallet service, this week.In the UK last week, PayPal launched a cheap card-payment product for mobile merchants that will increase its presence, and other services such as Square in the US and iZettle in Europe are also targeting the sector. Google and Apple have both launched digital wallet products.Mobile payments have also been seen as a source of revenues for mobile operators, whose returns have so far failed to match the huge investments in infrastructure required to service the mobile internet.Mr Lambert said that although he welcomed moves by competitors – some of whom already accept MasterCard through their systems – merchants were unlikely to support many platforms.“In the physical world you can have three [payment systems] max,” he said. “Online you will have a few more, but I see a convergence towards a few brands that offer interoperability. You cannot have a website where you have MasterPass, V.me, Google Wallet, iTunes and several others.”
107;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-01-29T19:49:48Z;Virgin Care opens clinic in Boots outlet;;Virgin Care, part of Sir Richard Branson’s business empire, has opened a sexual health clinic in an outlet of Boots, the chemist – the first of several potential high street openings.The privately owned group already provides sexual health advice for more than 2m people under a deal with the National Health Service. But the launch of the clinic in Boots’ Milton Keynes store is the company’s first tie-up with a retailer – and chimes with the government’s bid to shift more NHS services into the community.Virgin, which runs sexual health clinics in Teesside, Surrey and Oldham, is also expected to take over the provision of sexual health services for the North and North East Lincolnshire NHS trusts in a three-year £1.5m contract starting in April.The moves come ahead of an expected increase in opportunities for the private sector in the NHS. With the Department of Health expected to trim billions of pounds from its budget over the next few years, the pace of outsourcing has accelerated, with everything from entire hospitals to piecemeal services such as pathology, sexual health or dentistry being put out to tender.Several primary care trusts have already outsourced their community care, as more services are shifted from hospitals and residential centres. Last year, NHS Surrey awarded a landmark £450m deal over five years to Virgin Care to provide community and specialist nursing services. Serco has also won a groundbreaking £140m, three-year contract to run community services, including home care, in Suffolk.Virgin now runs more than 100 NHS services nationwide, ranging from community health and children’s social care centres, to diagnostic services such as radiology departments, as well as GP clinics.It is also one of 39 organisations – including Serco and Circle – to have expressed an interest in running parts of the South London Healthcare Trust, which operates three hospitals but last year became the first trust to be put into administration. An announcement on the trust’s future is expected later this week.In April, Virgin is expected to take over children’s services for NHS Devon and Devon county council. Under the three-year, £132m contract it will take over frontline services for children including mental health, school nursing, health visits and care for the disabled.Virgin said: “Our aim with our sexual health services is to offer better access to free NHS sexual health services. By colocating with Boots in Milton Keynes we have taken these services on to the high street and into an environment where services are easy to access yet provided in the strictest confidence.”Boots said an increasing number of providers to the NHS had been taking space in its stores over the past five years including GP surgeries, blood testing and dental services.The deal comes amid a rise in the number of routine NHS-funded operations carried out by the private sector. According to the Health and Social Care Information Centre, private providers treated 345,200 non-emergency NHS patients in 2011-12, an increase of almost 33,000 on the previous 12 months.
108;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-01-20T18:31:55Z;European buyouts suffer winter freeze;;The emergence last week of a potential $20bn private equity “mega-buyout” in the US is a slap in the face for the European sector, which cannot even manage to get a €5bn deal away.Just as US buyout firm Silver Lake has made headway with a bid for computer maker Dell, a deal in Europe that could have been one of the most ambitious of the year has been put on ice. EQT has shelved a plan to sell German academic publisher Springer Science for up to €4bn, according to people familiar with the situation.The Swedish firm believes it can get a better price for the company it bought in 2009 when it delivers on its targets and offers visibility for 2014, the people said. EQT, which hired advisers last year to explore an IPO or a sale, has received interest from private equity investors including Providence and Carlyle, as well as German media group Bertelsmann. It may revive the deal in the second half of the year.The development highlights the challenges facing private equity firms in exiting multi-billion buyouts in Europe, where so-called “pass-the-parcel” deals – the sales of private equity-backed companies to other buyout firms – account for half of volumes. While the IPO route has remained a volatile option, straightforward disposals have been hampered by banks’ reluctance to lend large amounts, limiting the ability of other buyout houses to match the sellers’ prices.While bankers are still hopeful that European mega-deals could return this year, helped by recovering credit markets, many of the buyouts done during the credit bubble at expensive prices are likely to prove the trickiest to sell on. Held back a sluggish economy, firms are still holding nearly 80 percent of the European companies they bought in 2007 and two-thirds of those acquired in 2006, according to Preqin, the data company.This is forcing private equity firms to be creative. KKR sold part of its stake in Alliance Boots to US pharmacy group Walgreen in a cash-and-share deal, allowing a partial realisation of its £12bn LBO, Europe’s largest. Last year, it sold a minority stake in Kion – the German forklift maker it bought with Goldman Sachs for €4bn in 2006 – to Shandong Heavy, to reduce debt ahead of a possible listing.CVC, Permira and Charterhouse are weighing a break-up of Acromas, the cars-to-retirement group formed in 2007 in a £6.2bn merger of the AA and Saga. One option is a listing or a sale of the AA, the roadside recovery unit, for as much as £5bn, people familiar with the situation said.Charterhouse is also eyeing a break-up for Elior, the French catering company it took private in 2006, now valued at about €4bn. The €2bn sale of a catering unit could start in March.
109;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2013-01-07T00:03:43Z;‘Mega deals’ help UK to buck M&A trend;;There was a nearly 5 per cent rise in the value of UK mergers and acquisitions in 2012, driven by the largest number of £1bn-plus “mega deals” for three years, according to Experian.The information services company said Britain outperformed the averages for the rest of Europe, Asia and the US, which all had declines in the volume and overall value of transactions.Experian said the number of £1bn-plus UK deals announced last year rose 15 per cent to 39, worth a total of £128bn.Most were cross-border, including the $5bn acquisition of NDS, a pay television software company, by California-based Cisco Systems and the $6.5bn investment in Alliance Boots, the retail chemist, by Walgreens of the US.The volume of mergers, acquisitions, flotations, rights issues and placements fell 3 per cent to 4,543, led primarily by a final-quarter decline of 11 per cent compared with a year earlier. But thanks to the mega deals, the total value of transactions rose 4.8 per cent to £242bn.The most active sector for mega deals was food and drink manufacturing with 15 per cent of transactions, including Diageo’s £1.2bn purchase of India’s United Spirits and the £1.2bn acquisition of Weetabix by Bright Food, the Chinese conglomerate.After that came chemical manufacturing with 13 per cent, and professional and business services with 10 per cent.Northern Ireland had the largest increase in deal volumes, up 37 per cent from a low base, with Scotland up 10 per cent and southwest England up 7 per cent.“Despite the challenges faced by the eurozone crisis, the UK has proven to be one of the most attractive markets in what has been a subdued year for mergers and acquisitions globally,” said Wendy Driver, business development manager at Experian.She added: “The quality of UK businesses and assets, as well as favourable interest rates, has been consistently attractive to overseas investors which is helping to keep mergers and acquisitions activity buoyant and may serve to boost confidence further.”The rest of Europe saw a 10.5 per cent drop in the value of transactions, with Asia-Pacific down 13.5 per cent and the US down 6.4 per cent.In Britain, transactions funded by bank debt rose from 277 to 309 and mezzanine-funded deals from seven to 12. But deals funded through venture capital dropped from 651 to 595, probably because slow growth made the likely returns less attractive to investors.The mid-market range, or deals worth £10m-£100m, was the worst affected segment for M&A, with volumes down 6 per cent. The level of small deals (£0.5m-£10m) and large deals (£100m-£1bn) remained relatively static.Experian said there was a British element in 47.3 per cent of all European transactions, up from 43.7 per cent in 2011, and in terms of value the UK contributed almost 42 per cent of the European total for 2012.
110;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-11-12T00:07:13Z;Businesses encourage worker involvement;;The heads of some of Britain’s largest businesses are to launch an initiative to persuade others to take employee engagement more seriously, arguing that Britain is losing an estimated £26bn in annual output because of failure to motivate staff.The chief executives of BAE Systems, PwC, United Utilities, Standard Chartered, WPP, Marks and Spencer, Barclays, Lloyds, Alliance Boots, Whitbread, Prudential, O2 and others warn in an open letter that two-thirds of the UK workforce is failing to reach its full productive potential.The aim is to get employees more involved in the decision-making of their companies.“We invite UK plc to join this movement for better engagement at work, so we all raise our game to meet the challenges ahead,” they say.Leaders from private, public and third-sector organisations will meet at the business department in London on Monday to launch the latest evidence about the effectiveness of employee engagement, presented by the independent “Engage for Success” taskforce.The taskforce, formed of managers, trade unionists and experts, is co-chaired by David MacLeod and Nita Clarke, who wrote a report on the topic for the previous government in 2009.The UK comes ninth in a ranking of engagement levels among the world’s 12 largest economies, according to a taskforce research paper. Two-thirds of workers in a survey cited by the taskforce said they had more to offer in skills and talent.The move is backed by David Cameron, the prime minister, who said: “With only a third of UK workers saying they feel engaged, I encourage all companies to get involved in this important initiative.”
111;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-10-26T13:14:34Z;KKR falls short on N America fundraising;;KKR has raised only $6.2bn for its latest North American buyout fund, short of an expected $8bn, as investor enthusiasm for private equity recedes in the face of lacklustre performance.The modest total for the group founded and run by industry pioneers George Roberts and Henry Kravis comes after more than 18 months in which it has gone cap in hand to investors such as pension funds and marks a considerable decline from KKR’s previous buyout fund, which closed with $17.6bn in 2006.Reporting strong growth in third-quarter earnings on Friday, KKR said it had raised only $700m for the fund since February. Overall fundraising for the private equity industry is running at around half the rate of the boom years of 2007 and 2008, when more than $650bn was raised each year, according to Preqin, a data provider.It follows poor performance for KKR’s 2006 fund, in part due to losses sustained on Energy Future Holdings. KKR led the leveraged buyout of the Texas utility – the largest LBO ever – in 2007, but has written down the value of its investment by 95 per cent after a collapse in gas prices.With $16.3bn of the 2006 fund invested, KKR carries the value of the fund’s investments at just 1.4 times invested capital.However, earlier this year rival private equity group Blackstone proved that it is still possible to raise mega-funds, completing a $16bn global fundraising that began at the start of 2011.KKR said that this year it had focused on raising capital for its Asian fund, where it has had more success than peers and now has $4bn committed, and aimed to close the North America fund with $7bn to $8bn next year. Fee paying assets under management are up 6.6 per cent over the past 12 months to $50.3bn.Fee-related earnings dropped 8 per cent from a year ago to $90.7m, but were well ahead of analyst expectations as KKR earned $17.8m in incentive fees during the quarter, its highest level of “carry”, or investment profits, since going public.Distributable earnings, a measure of cash profits available to holders of KKR units, were $333m, up from $185m a year ago as the group received its first payment related to the sale of a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots to US pharmacy chain Walgreens for $6.7bn, allowing it to distribute some investment profits.The group announced a cash distribution of 24 cents per unit, up from 10 cents a year ago.The audited financial statements of listed alternative asset managers are distorted by the accounting treatment of corporate reorganisations before listing. On that basis KKR net income swung from a loss of $243m a year ago to a profit of $124m.KKR units were down 0.7 per cent at $14.73 late afternoon in New York.Additional reporting by Henny Sender

114;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-09-16T18:56:59Z;Boots in China pharmaceuticals deal;;Just months after striking a £10bn deal to sell eventually the whole of Alliance Boots, chairman Stefano Pessina has taken a minority stake in a Chinese pharmaceutical wholesaler.Alliance Boots said on Sunday that it had spent £56m to acquire a 12 per cent holding in Nanjing Pharmaceutical, the fifth largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in China by sales.It comes hard on the heels of Mr Pessina’s deal in June to initially sell a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots to Walgreens, with the option for the US pharmacy chain to buy the whole of Alliance Boots.Mr Pessina said the latest acquisition would give Alliance Boots “a further presence in China”.Nanjing Pharmaceutical, which is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, had sales of about £2bn in 2011. Alliance Boots said it had a strong market position in its home province of Jiangsu, operating distribution centres in 12 cities across eight provinces.Alliance Boots already has a position in China through its joint venture with Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals, the sixth largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in China, which operates in complementary geographies.“Together they represent more or less 5 per cent of the Chinese market, [which is] not negligible,” said Mr Pessina.He said Alliance Boots was keen to develop its position in China, because it was a big market, which was likely to consolidate over the coming years. “We must be part of this consolidation process,” said Mr Pessina.As well as seeking a presence in the US, Mr Pessina has long been keen to build Alliance Boots’s reach in China.He told the FT earlier this year that becoming a global retail and pharmaceutical wholesaling group was “not wishful thinking, it’s a project”.“To be global you must be in the US, you must be in South America, you must be in Asia more generally, but specifically China,” he said.When he struck the Walgreens deal, Mr Pessina said he could still use the group’s strong cash flow to make further acquisitions.Mr Pessina said the programme of cost savings from the Walgreens deal – $100m to $150m in the first year – was progressing well, with Alliance Boots sending teams to the US and vice versa.He said the two groups were “creating this relationship which will be fundamental for the collaboration in the future”.
115;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-07-27T13:19:02Z;KKR bucks trend in weak market;;Buyout group KKR bucked the trend of weak markets during the second quarter as the deal struck last month to merge Alliance Boots with the pharmacy chain Walgreens boosted its balance sheet.The jump in the value of KKR’s stake in the high street retailer and pharmaceuticals distributor, taken private in a roughly £12bn deal at the height of the private equity boom, pushed the value of KKR’s investment portfolio up 5.1 per cent in a period when the MSCI world index declined almost 6 per cent.The complex deal that will initially see Walgreens buy 45 per cent of Alliance Boots was largely responsible for a rise in the value of KKR’s investments, and came as the group also sold down its stake in another 2007 buyout, Dollar General.Economic net income, a measure of performance that captures such balance sheet moves and excludes certain non-cash accounting charges associated with a corporate reorganisation prior to listing, rose 73 per cent on the same period last year to $546m.Assets under management for the New York-based investment firm dropped 1 per cent to $61.5bn, as the return of capital to investors in its funds outweighed fundraising and the rise in value of its investments during the quarter.“We completed or announced transactions which are expected to return over $4bn of capital to our private equity investors, continued to grow our Asian private equity and energy and infrastructure platforms,” Henry Kravis and George Roberts, co-chairmen and chief executives, said in a statement.However, the total does not include $6bn committed so far to KKR’s 11th private equity fund, $3bn raised for its next Asian fund and the $7.8bn managed by Prisma Capital Advisors, a fund of hedge funds purchased during the quarter for an undisclosed sum.KKR also announced an expansion of its capital markets activities as part of a joint venture with fellow private equity group Stone Point. Each will commit $150m to the new entity, Merchant Advisors, which will aim to provide investment banking services to medium-sized companies.Distributable earnings of $406m were almost triple that of the second quarter last year, reflecting proceeds from secondary stock offerings at Dollar General.Income from fees was $69.8m in the quarter, down from $76.1m a year ago as incentive fees paid by KFN, a listed vehicle managed by KKR, declined.KKR will distribute 13 cents to holders of shareholder units, up from 11 cents in the same period last year. Over the past year the group has distributed 70 cents, in effect a yield of 4.9 per cent. KKR’s stock rose 6.3 per cent to $15.15 in pre-market trading on Friday.
116;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-07-19T17:31:28Z;Walgreens and Express Scripts end dispute;;Walgreens and Express Scripts settled a heated dispute over fees, ending a breach between the biggest US pharmacy chain and the country’s largest pharmacy benefits manager.Walgreens stopped filling prescriptions for millions of Express Scripts customers in January after the two companies failed to renew their agreement over how much Walgreens is paid for the prescriptions it fills.Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefits managers administer prescription drug plans for insurers and big companies, negotiating for lower prices from drug companies and pharmacies in a bid to bring down healthcare costs for consumers.Financial terms of the new contract were not disclosed on Tuesday, but the companies said it was a multiyear deal, and that Walgreens would begin filling Express Scripts orders again on September 15. Walgreens said the terms were consistent with the fees it paid other pharmacy benefits managers.The dispute eroded investor confidence in Walgreens, with analysts estimating the loss of Express Scripts customers could cost the pharmacy chain revenues of $10bn a year or more. Express Scripts customers accounted for 88m, or more than 10 per cent, of prescriptions filled at Walgreens last year.Sales at Walgreens began to slide, as customers took not only their drug buying but impulse purchases for groceries and home care products to other stores.In the seven months since the dispute began, Express Scripts customers have turned to rival pharmacy chains such as CVS Caremark and Rite Aid, which sought to take advantage of the dispute by advertising that they still worked with Express Scripts.“Whether [Express Scripts] prescription customers will all switch back to [Walgreens] now remains to be seen, but it seems likely that many have been lost permanently,” said Carol Levenson of Gimme Credit, the research group.Walgreens’ losses could have grown had the dispute not been resolved, as Express Scripts just completed its $29bn acquisition of Medco, another pharmacy benefits manager. Medco clients were never prevented from filling prescriptions at Walgreens, but analysts speculated that could have happened soon.Walgreens last month paid $6.5bn for a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots, the UK pharmacist. The two-stage deal will allow Walgreens to take full control of Alliance Boots, which was taken private five years ago in a £12bn deal led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the company’s chairman, Stefano Pessina.News of the deal sent Walgreens shares up 10.3 per cent to $34.16 by mid-afternoon in New York, while Express Scripts shares rose 1.9 per cent to $58.79. CVS shares were down 5.1 per cent to $45.97 and Rite Aid was down 5.5 per cent at $1.21.
117;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-07-06T16:34:10Z;KKR takes slice of cutlery company WMF;;Private equity firm KKR on Friday outlined plans to bring part of Germany’s famed Mittelstand to Asia and the US as it took a majority stake in WMF, a maker of cutlery, kitchenware and automated coffee machines, valuing the company’s equity at €670m.In a rare buyout transaction targeting a listed company, the US fund will pay the existing main shareholder, Swiss private equity firm Capvis, for its 52 per cent stake, and extend an offer to remaining shareholders of €47 a share, some 24 per cent above Thursday’s closing price.The southern German company is famed domestically for its cutlery, but it is the fast-growing coffee machines business catering to hotels and restaurants that is expected to deliver much of its future growth, particularly by boosting market share overseas.KKR stressed the potential for sales in Asia and the US, playing on Germany’s perceived expertise in manufacturing high-quality machines. It described WMF as “a true industry champion with significant further growth potential”.After some difficult investments in Europe, KKR scored a notable success last month when it partly exited its biggest buyout, Alliance Boots, in a $6.5bn deal for 45 per cent of the company.KKR already has five German investments, including Kion, a forklift truckmaker, and ATU, a car parts business, in which it first invested in 2006. KKR subsequently bought BMG, the music rights business, and with Permira owns ProSiebenSat.1, the TV group. Last year KKR bought Versatel, a German telecoms group, in a buyout from a group led by Apax Partners.Private equity groups and investors have had mixed success in Germany, where a mass of successful family-owned companies are seen as interesting targets but are often reluctant sellers. But the German market has come more into the spotlight as the economy has powered ahead despite the eurozone crisis.Blackstone, the investment group, this week said it would expand its advisory business in Germany, saying it saw significant potential for deals.Of WMF’s €980m of sales last year, more than half came from consumer lines and from its 220 retail outlets. A further 29 per cent of sales came from coffee machines for hotels and caterers – the most profitable part of the business.WMF was founded almost 160 years ago near Stuttgart, one of Germany’s most entrepreneurial regions known as a centre of carmaking.
118;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-06-24T19:41:47Z;Alliance Boots buyout success story;;The £12bn acquisition of Alliance Boots is one of the more successful private equity buyouts of the 2006-07 era.Although the public-to private deal was struck at the height of the financial boom, Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, look to have almost tripled their investment from the deal, under which Walgreens could swallow the whole of Alliance Boots for £10bn in three years' time.In the first phase of the deal, Walgreens will buy 45 per cent of Alliance Boots for about £4bn.Under the stewardship of Mr Pessina, Alliance Boots has achieved double digit increases in profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items in each of the past five years.This has been achieved by expanding sales, but also tightly controlling costs.Alliance Boots was saddled with £9bn of debt when it was acquired. It has cut its net debt by £2bn over the past five years, helped by the more than £1bn a year of cash that the business throws off. The retailer and pharmaceutical wholesaler is expected to cut net borrowings to between £5.5bn and £6bn by the time Walgreens exercises the option to acquire the remaining 55 per cent of Alliance Boots.The group has however courted controversy during the time it has been in private hands, by restructuring the business, with associated job losses, and closing Boots’s UK pension schemes to existing members. It has also moved its domicile to Switzerland, bringing scrutiny of its tax affairs.Not all of the work that Alliance Boots set out to do is done. It has more to do in adding services to its stores, such as doctors’ surgeries.The Walgreens deal will however help Mr Pessina achieve another one of his long-term goals – building a third leg of the business in terms of Boots’s own brands, with lines such as No 7 cosmetics to be sold through the 8,000 Walgreens stores in the US.
119;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-06-24T16:38:30Z;Debt party leaves buyouts with a hangover;;At the 2007 closing of the $45bn acquisition of TXU, the Texas utility, executives involved with the largest leveraged buyout of all time talked up the merits of the deal with gusto.“This transaction is not only good for TXU shareholders, but also for employees, customers and residents,” said Donald Evans, a former US commerce secretary who became chairman of the new company.Barely four years later, however, one of the most high profile investors of all time was lamenting the deal. Warren Buffett, a bondholder in TXU, which became Energy Future Holdings, wrote in this year’s annual letter that he had misjudged the company’s prospects, writing down more than $1.4bn on his position. “In tennis parlance, this was a major unforced error,” Mr Buffett said.TXU was hurt not just by the sharp decline in natural gas prices that followed the shale gas boom but also by the weight of its own debt.Like many of the so-called “megabuyouts” of 2006 and 2007, the TXU deal was fuelled by cheap financing and soaring ambitions that led to ever-larger deals. As the financial crisis hit, however, it quickly looked like many of the biggest deals had been struck with inflated valuations.Yet as demonstrated by last week’s Alliance Boots deal, some of those big acquisitions are turning out to be good investments. Alliance Boots, bought by KKR for $20.6bn in 2007, is set to be acquired by Walgreens in a two step process over the next three years. KKR expects to more than double its money.What distinguishes the winners from the losers in this vintage has as much to do with the particulars of each business as it does the nature of “megabuyouts” as a class. However, the record prices paid to take companies private in 2006 and 2007 made them that much more fragile when the financial crisis hit.“Very high prices were paid when compared to historic purchase price multiples,” said John Morris, managing director at HarbourVest, a private equity firm. “When the economy turned and growth went away, those multiples were clearly out of whack with reality.”Freescale, a computer chip maker, experienced a fall in demand for its products shortly after it was taken private by a Blackstone-led group for $17.6bn in 2006. Blackstone, TPG and Carlyle have realised billions in losses from the Freescale deal.A collection of media buyouts were particularly hard hit, as disruptions in the sector intensified problems with the deals. Terra Firma’s 2007 buyout of EMI, sealed just as credit markets began to freeze, has already unravelled. After a public battle to keep earnings one step ahead of its rising interest bills in an industry hit by technological change, Guy Hands’ private equity group Terra Firma lost the business to Citigroup in February.The bank, which had never managed to syndicate its loans to others, has agreed to sell EMI in two pieces, to Universal Music and a Sony-led consortium. If regulators clear both deals, the $4.1bn proceeds will repay most, but not all, of Terra Firma’s £3.4bn debts to Citigroup.Two educational publishers have also struggled with the debt legacies of their buyouts. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the US textbook company assembled in two leveraged deals by Barry O’Callaghan, an Irish entrepreneur, emerged from a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy process last week, eliminating $3.1bn of debt on top of the $4bn lenders agreed to cut in a 2010 restructuring.Cengage, a college textbook business that Apax Partners bought from Thomson Corp in 2007, has sought to amend and extend the terms of some of its debt. Moody’s lowered its outlook on Cengage’s $5.9bn debt load to “negative” in April, saying the company’s prospects for refinancing loans coming due in 2014 and 2015 were “reasonable but not assured”. Both publishers compete in education with Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.Several of the biggest buyouts, however, proved to be good investments. The second, third and fourth-largest deals from 2006 and 2007 are all wins for private equity firms behind them.Equity Office Properties, a real estate trust bought by Blackstone in 2006 for $39bn, was quickly split up for a profit. HCA, a healthcare provider acquired for $33bn by a consortium of Bain, KKR and Merrill Lynch in 2006, went public after the sponsors took out billions in dividends. And Alltel, a technology company bought by TPG and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners for $28bn in 2007, was quickly sold to Verizon Wireless, generating a profit of about $1.3bn.Industry observers say that the megabuyouts were inevitable given the proliferation of cheap credit before the financial crisis. “It’s not like people didn’t know the punch bowl was going away, but they wanted to get the last sip before it was gone,” said Donna Hitscherich, who teaches private equity at Columbia University’s business school.Yet given the mixed record of the class, some of the big flops will inevitably weigh on the returns of the funds behind the deals. “It’s going to be a struggle for these vintages to do more than the single digit returns, and that’s not what they were looking for,” said David de Weese, partner at Paul Capital. “If they get above 5 per cent it will be heroic.”Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson
120;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-06-22T16:44:22Z;Dealmaking flair of Alliance Boots head;;Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, has struck plenty of deals over his 40-year career.But they were eclipsed this week by the agreement he and private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts struck eventually to sell Alliance Boots for about £10bn.“I have done many deals in my life, and some transformational deals, at least transformational at the time. I have to say that all the deals I have done are really very small if compared to this deal,” he said.At 71 – an age when many executives might think about slowing down – Mr Pessina has been scouring the globe for his latest deal.He told the FT in April that he was looking for another game-changing transaction, and was particularly eyeing the US.Mr Pessina said this week that the tie-up with Walgreens, in which the US pharmacy chain will initially take a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots for more than $6bn, was a dream come true.The Italian entrepreneur, with his white hair, smart suits and jovial manner, trained as a nuclear physicist in Milan.Born to a well-to-do Milanese family, he started out by taking on part of his family’s eclectic business interests. While other family members supplied textiles to Milan’s fashion houses, Mr Pessina set about constructing a wholesale pharmaceutical distribution chain, initially in Italy, but spanning Europe by the turn of the millenniumIt was through this business – and his hunt for deals – that he met his long-time partner, Italian businesswoman Ornella Barra, who now runs the Alliance Boots wholesale pharmaceutical business. Mr Pessina originally combined his pharmaceutical wholesale business in the south of Italy with Ms Barra’s in the north.Together they acquired a series of companies in France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Morocco, to create Alliance Santé.More transformational deals followed. In 1997, Alliance Santé merged with UniChem to create Alliance UniChem. Nine years later, Alliance UniChem sealed a deal with Boots, one of Britain’s best-known high street chains. In 2007, Mr Pessina and KKR took Alliance Boots private in a £12.4bn deal. The acquisition, at the height of the financial boom, was at the time Europe’s biggest buyout.His dealmaking skills – and his successful stewardship of Alliance Boots over the past five years while battling £9bn of debt and sluggish markets – have made Mr Pessina rich.He made £500m from the buyout, but will not take any cash from the first phase of the latest deal. Instead, he will have an about 8 per cent holding in Walgreens, worth about £1.4bn. He could make another £2bn from the second phase, which he is also likely to take in shares. He initially invested £1.2bn in the deal.“I’m not looking for money,” he insisted this week.But some of Mr Pessina’s actions have raised eyebrows. He closed the Boots final salary pension schemes, which he has regarded as unfair, to existing members. The Monaco-based entrepreneur also moved Alliance Boots’s domicile to the low-tax region of Zug in Switzerland, courting scrutiny of the company’s tax affairs.But according to Samuel Johar, chairman of headhunter Buchanan Harvey: “Too many retail leaders are doers rather than thinkers. Stefano is a thinker. And he is also prepared to be bold. He has done a really fantastic job at Boots, when the previous management floundered. Despite the fact that he paid a huge premium, he has managed to elicit far more value than anyone imagined.”
121;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-06-22T14:09:33Z;Letter from Lex: broken models;Microsoft unveils its new tablet and others fix broken models;The phrase broken windows used to conjure up images of urban vandalism and zero tolerance. Now it is more likely to bring Microsoft to mind. In an effort to revive its most important product, Windows software, the US tech giant unveiled its Surface tablet computer, but there are still big questions about pricing and functionality.Microsoft was not the only company looking for a new model. Both Verizon and Comcast have introduced new rational pricing plans to prevent customer arbitrage, but that strategy might result in cut-throat discounting wars. In Asia, Hon Hai and Sharp’s LCD alliance may lead to a way to regenerate Japanese tech has-beens and allow lost-cost producers to move to higher-margin businesses. In telecoms, Dutch group KPN continued to defend its less-than-stellar past model – while trying unsuccessfully to wring value from its German operations – as it opposes advances from Carlos Slim’s América Móvil.Elsewhere it was about British engineers and flying machines. UK engineering turnround specialist Melrose revealed it was in talks to buy German meter-maker Elster while Invensys saw its share price rise and fall after disclosing a takeover approach by Emerson Electric. Meanwhile Ryanair made its third bid in six years for rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus and the founder of Brazilian airline Gol unexpectedly announced he would step down next month.Finally in consumer goods, US drugstore Walgreens agreed to pay $6.7bn for a 45 per cent stake in UK pharmacy-based retailer Alliance Boots while both Procter & Gamble and Danone warned of lower earnings ahead. But perhaps the most intriguing deal of the week involved several independent-minded billionaires with one selling media assets – Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp offering A$2bn for James Packer’s Consolidated Media – in order to place bets on a gambling company. Oh and then there was Greece and Spain, but you may have already read about their broken models somewhere before.John Casey, Lex Publisher
122;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Boots deal concerns weigh on Walgreens;;Shares in Walgreens closed down 2.9 per cent in New York on Wednesday as US investors continued to give a cool reception to the US pharmacy chain’s £10bn deal to eventually swallow the whole of Alliance Boots.Wednesday’s drop in Walgreens’ shares takes the fall since the deal with Alliance Boots was announced to more than 8 per cent.It has also emerged that the UK’s Ocado held talks with Boots about selling the health and beauty chain’s products through its online grocery business, according to people familiar with the situation.Although the two sides are thought unlikely to come to an agreement, the contact with Boots underlines Ocado’s ambition to build a second arm to its business selling non-food items to its largely affluent online grocery customers. All parties declined to comment.Boots also has ambitions to develop its online presence further. Under its deal with Walgreens, in which the US group will initially take a 45 per cent stake in Boots for more than $6bn, both companies will work together to share best practice on online retailing and increase the range of products sold via the internet, although online was not “at the heart” of the deal, according to one person familiar with the situation.Jeff Jonas, healthcare analyst at Gamco Investors, said the market was focusing on the deal’s short-term implications, such as Walgreens cancelling its share buyback programme to fund the acquisition. This had boosted Walgreens’ earnings by 5-6 per cent a year, he said.“There is a little bit of criticism over the deal, whether it’s the multiple that has been paid, or going into a somewhat risky international deal,” said Mr Jonas.Some investors are also thought to be uncomfortable with the level of debt that Walgreens would be taking on in the second phase of the deal.Analysts and bankers thought it was unlikely that a counter-bidder would emerge for Boots. It was well known that Stefano Pessina, the group’s executive chairman had been looking for a merger rather than a public auction, and the deal appeared to have been sealed by Mr Pessina and Gregory Wasson, Walgreens’ chief executive.Ocado is expected to highlight the opportunities in non-food when it announces its first-half results next week.
123;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-06-19T19:18:48Z;Walgreens pays $6.5bn for Boots stake;;Walgreens, the US’s biggest drugstore by sales, has set out its ambition to create a global pharmacy chain by buying a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots for about $6.5bn.In a two-stage deal, Walgreens, which had sales of $72bn last year, could eventually own all of the UK pharmacist – marking a sharp change of course for a US chain with hitherto domestic horizons.Walgreens will gain international exposure through Boots’s store network and its wholesale distribution business, while the enhanced buying power of a combined company could push down drug prices for consumers, analysts said.According to Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, the deal will pave the way for further acquisitions, including in China and Latin America. Alluding to Walgreens’ strong cash flow, he said: “We will have so much money that we’ll have to buy something and expand rapidly.”Mr Pessina took Alliance Boots private with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts five years ago in a £12bn deal – Europe’s biggest buyout at the time – and he has long sought a US tie-up.David Magee, managing director at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said the deal would help Walgreen tap global growth in prescription sales, but he acknowledged investor concerns: “Buying a company in Europe is not the headline a lot of shareholders wanted to see. They take on more debt and increase the operational risk going forward, and the company had a lot of balls in the air prior to this.”Walgreens’ shares fell 5.7 per cent to $30.15 in afternoon trading. Investor confidence in Walgreens has been eroded by a dispute that ended its partnership with Express Scripts, which manages prescription plans. “We were expecting them to do something to offset the $10-11bn in lost revenues from Express Scripts,” said David Larsen, healthcare analyst at Leerink Swann.Mr Pessina, an Italian who lives in Monte Carlo, denied the deal was effectively the end of Boots as one of the best-known chains in Britain: “How could I do a deal to kill Boots? I have been after Boots for years, and I would never do a deal to kill Boots. I have done a deal to make Boots more visible, more international, to create a lot of new markets for Boots and for [the manufacturing facility at] Nottingham.”He insisted: “Boots will thrive, not [just] survive.”Under the terms of the deal, Walgreens will initially acquire 45 per cent of Alliance Boots for $4bn in cash and $2.5bn in shares. Walgreens has an option to acquire the remaining 55 per cent of Boots for $4.9bn in cash and shares that were worth about $4.3bn on Tuesday. It would also assume Boots’ outstanding debt, which was £7bn net at the end of March.Goldman Sachs and Lazard advised Walgreens on the deal, with Centerview Partners acting for Alliance Boots.
124;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Walgreens / Boots: popcorn and prescriptions;Transatlantic retail adventures have not always been happy;Popcorn with your lavender water? Speculation over a tie-up between US drugstore chain Walgreens and UK pharmacy-based retailer Alliance Boots has circulated for years. Stefano Pessina, AB’s executive chairman, says it has been on his radar for a decade. Now Walgreens plans to pay $6.7bn for a 45 per cent stake in AB, which was taken private by KKR in conjunction with Mr Pessina five years ago. There is the option of full ownership for another $9.5bn in three years’ time.The AB deal was the first leveraged buyout of a FTSE 100 company. And while gearing helped KKR and Mr Pessina make money in spite of buying at the top of the market, they ran the company well. Revenues grew 60 per cent between 2007 and 2008 and 2011 and 2012, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation increased 45 per cent. KKR’s offer in 2007 put an enterprise value of £12.2bn on the UK retailer, of which about £1bn was debt: the first stage of this Walgreens deal suggests an EV of £17bn, but close to £7bn is debt.Still, this price implies a generous 11 times EV/ebidta ratio for AB. That partly explains why Walgreen’s shares fell 6 per cent on Tuesday. Some investors also doubt the $1bn in proposed annual synergy benefits. Yes, revenue synergies should generally be waved away, but the prescription drug procurement savings could be substantial. Taxing and capitalising even half the projected gains pays for the initial 45 per cent slug of AB in two years. It is perhaps telling that the sellers are keeping skin in the game.And the deal’s timing is helpful for Walgreens, mired in a scrap with widely used drugs benefit manager Express Scripts. But for all the talk of “iconic brands”, the retailers have different images, and transatlantic retail adventures have not always been happy. This will be one for the textbooks no matter what happens.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
125;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-06-19T18:01:34Z;Walgreens aims global with Boots tie-up;;Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, has finally pulled off another transformational deal.Mr Pessina, 71, who took Alliance Boots private five years ago with private equity group KKR in a roughly £12bn deal, has sold 45 per cent of the high street retailer and pharmaceuticals distributor to Walgreen Co, the US pharmacy chain, for $6.5bn in cash and shares.“I have always believed that our industry needed a global player and I have really worked for that for the last 10 years, and at the end to have the possibility to really make this dream true, it’s really fantastic for me,” Mr Pessina said on Tuesday.“I have done many deals in my life, and some transformational deals, at least transformational at the time. I have to say that all the deals I have done are really very small if compared to this deal.”The transatlantic tie-up will see Alliance Boots and Walgreens work together over the next two to three years. Walgreens has the option to acquire the remaining 55 per cent of Alliance Boots in three years for $9.3bn in cash and shares while assuming the group’s then outstanding debt.For Walgreens, which has almost 8,000 drug stores in the US, the deal brings access to Alliance Boots’ pharmaceutical wholesale business.The drug distribution arm has operations in markets including China, Russia and Turkey. Boots has also been expanding its international footprint, with pharmacies in Thailand, the Netherlands and Norway.Mr Pessina said he wanted to help Walgreens become “a really global player”, with the intention of expanding in China and gaining a foothold in Latin America. Walgreens also gains access to Alliance Boots’ own brands, particularly its successful No 7 cosmetics range. In addition, it will have access to Alliance Boots’ research and development and production facilities in Nottingham.For Alliance Boots, the deal adds the US arm that Mr Pessina has long craved. Walgreens will also be a new distribution outlet for Alliance Boots’ brands, which could increase business in Nottingham, where there will be no job cuts. “If anything, we will have to hire people to produce more products,” Mr Pessina said. However, the deal may have more financial advantages for Alliance Boots’s owners.Despite being at an age when other executives want to spend more time on the golf course, Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, insisted that he was not looking for an exit, writes Andrea Felsted. “How can I exit? I’m just 71,” he said.Instead, he wants to work with Walgreens’ chief executive Greg Wasson to help the group become “truly global”. Indeed, he has set his sights on further deals, in China and Latin America in particular.The move to sell 45 per cent of Alliance Boots to Walgreens gives Mr Pessina the equivalent of 8 per cent of the US pharmacy chain, worth about $2bn. His shareholding could rise considerably if the second phase of the deal is exercised.Mr Pessina’s long-time partner, Ornella Barra, also works in the business, running Alliance Boots’s pharmaceutical wholesale arm.Mr Pessina is a serial dealmaker. He built his pharmaceutical wholesaler Alliance Santé after deals in France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Morocco.In 1997, Alliance Santé merged with UniChem to create Alliance UniChem. Nine years later, Alliance UniChem sealed a deal with Boots.Mr Pessina denied he was in effect selling the company to Walgreens, bringing his tenure to an end, even though the second phase of the deal would see Walgreens acquire the whole of Alliance Boots.“This is an alliance. It’s not a takeover. I know what you are thinking. [But] …this is different …I can assure you that we will not be willing to accept anything else.”It is five years since it was acquired by Mr Pessina and KKR, in what was then Europe’s biggest buyout. KKR was approaching the point where it needed an exit, although this has been played down by Mr Pessina. Alliance Boots also has £7bn of net debt, which must be refinanced between 2014 and 2017. The deal with Walgreens, particularly the second stage, provides a potential exit for the investors.The debt situation, and Alliance Boots’ pensions – proposed changes to which have proved controversial – were unchanged by the deal, Mr Pessina and KKR said. “In three years’ time, one would anticipate the debt being considerably lower than it is today,” said Dominic Murphy, head of KKR’s healthcare industry team in Europe.It is anticipated that the deal would see Alliance Boots continue to reduce its borrowings by £500m a year, cutting net debt to between £5.5bn and £6bn by the time Walgreens completes the second phase.Mr Pessina denied the deal showed that the market had lost faith in initial public offerings. He said recently that he would prefer a merger to a float. “When you do an IPO you create financial values. When you do a merger you create substantial industrial values because you have a lot of synergies,” he said on Tuesday.Under the terms of the deal, in the first phase Mr Pessina will receive about a third of the proceeds, all in shares, equivalent to about 8 per cent of Walgreens, or about just over $2bn. This shareholding could rise significantly in phase two. Mr Pessina originally invested £1.2bn. If the second phase were to be exercised at the current Walgreens share price, KKR would make 2.7 times its original investment across phase one and two. In dollar terms, the total would be 2.2 times, because the dollar has strengthened since 2007. No dividends have been paid out since the start of the deal.Mr Pessina denied the sale would mean the end of Boots, although he acknowledged that the two companies had already contemplated a name for the acquired group that would “reflect the tradition and the story of the two companies”. “Boots will not change, Boots will remain Boots,” he insisted.Given Mr Pessina’s financial interest in the deal, he will be as keen as anyone to ensure this is the case.He admits he will benefit if the Walgreens share price rises. If that does not happen, he says, he will only have himself to blame. “I won’t be upset because the shares are not particularly repriced. I will be upset because I have not done my job well.”

And not just partners at KKR, the big US-based private equity firm that part owns the European pharmacies and drugs wholesaling group.The buyout in April 2007 was made as the credit cycle began to crest. Ever since, Alliance Boots has been the subject of gloomy predictions among financiers about the possible difficulty of rolling over net debt – about £7bn at the last count – or finding an exit.As it is, the deal with Walgreens lacks the brute bragging rights of a full cash sale at a steep price. The US drugstore chain is hedging its bets by buying a chunky stake now with the option to acquire the rest of the shares in three years.KKR is reputedly fired up at the synergies the merged entity might reap, not least as the world’s largest buyer of prescription medicines. But it may be making a virtue out of the necessity of taking part payment in shares.The earnings multiple for the initial stake sale to Walgreens is below that for the original buyout, made at a total price of £12.2bn including debt. But a full combination at an enterprise value for Alliance Boots of about £17bn would yield a return of about 2.7 times on KKR’s undisclosed slice of the £3.9bn equity investment that went into Alliance Boots in 2007.That would be a much better outcome than Cassandras have been prophesying. The realisation of bubble era buyouts, of which Alliance Boots was the most ambitious involving a UK group, may thus prove less hideous than feared.

Walgreens’ purchase of a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots for $6.5bn in cash and shares should be a cause for qualified relief among private equity executives. Most of all for partners at KKR, the big US-based private equity firm that owns a large chunk of the European pharmacies and drugs wholesaling group.The buyout in April 2007 was made as the credit cycle began to crest. Ever since, Alliance Boots has been the subject of gloomy predictions among financiers about the difficulty of rolling over net debt – about £7bn at the last count – or finding an exit in a tough market for M&A and private equity-backed flotations.As it is, the deal with Walgreens lacks the brute bragging rights of a full cash sale at a steep price.

Walgreens and Alliance Boots are a snug fit. But the private equity firm may be making a virtue out of the necessity of taking part of its payment in shares, albeit that the bulk would be in cash.The earnings multiple for the initial stake sale to Walgreens is below that for the original buyout, made at a total price of £12.2bn including debt.

The realisation of bubble era buyouts, of which Alliance Boots was the most ambitious involving a UK group, may thus prove less hideous than feared.Wishful thinking makes us selectively deaf. “Don’t extrapolate from a Q1 trading statement,” beseeched Whitbread chief executive Andy Harrison on Tuesday. Ears stuffed with cotton wool and humming lustily, bulls piled in anyhow, pushing the shares up 6.4 per cent.Their exuberance was understandable if not excusable, given the claggy trading conditions impeding other consumer businesses. In contrast, Whitbread, these days specialising in cheap hotels and strong coffee, glides along several feet above the mud. Sales to May 31 were up 14 per cent year-on-year, with caffeine pedlar Costa producing a storming like-for-like sales increase of 8.4 per cent.Whitbread is thriving because competition, like the coffee of rivals, is weak. Starbucks, a powerful brand in its home US market, finds the going tougher in Europe. And in UK hotels, Whitbread’s Premier Inn budget hotel brand has benefited from the travails of Travelodge, which has been struggling with a heavy debt burden.In its success, Whitbread is sowing the seeds of its own dissolution. To commit the lesser sin of extrapolating ahead from a long-term record, Costa, celebrating its 41st consecutive quarter of sales growth, could easily end up dwarfing Premier Inn.But background pressure for a demerger may only prove irresistible if performance flags. No sign of that yet, with shares trading on a forward earnings multiple of 13.5 times. That is pricier than the real risk of a pedestrian future should permit.It would be one small step for Mankind, but one great leap for the Isle of Man. Excalibur Almaz, a company based on the island, plans to take tourists on space trips lasting from six to eight months at an average price of £100m. And you thought season tickets on Southeastern trains were expensive. Not that there may be any more leg room on the space flights. The capsule is the size of a skip. And equally comfortable, one suspects. Like most of Excalibur Almaz’s hardware, it is ex-Soviet.The island, best-known for its tailless cats and tax exiles, is already big in the space industry, apparently. We must have failed to notice all those unmanned missions to Saturn, launched from a sheep field just outside Douglas.Anyway, Excalibur Almaz’s rockets, bought in from an established Russian space company, would blast off from Kazakhstan, where the skies are clearer and expertise greater.Thankfully Professor Colin Pillinger, the Open University’s tame wookie, is not supplying the technology. When his Beagle 2 probe added to Mars’ complement of craters in 2003 he likened space travel to playing interplanetary snooker. That is talk to rattle even the bravest billionaire space cadet.
128;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Moody’s warns on LBO debt defaults;;Europe’s struggling economy, stricken banks and turbulent financial markets will cause at least a quarter of Europe’s 254 unrated private equity deals with debts worth €133bn to default by 2015, according to Moody’s.If the continent’s high yield bond market– a vital source of funding for new and existing leveraged buyouts (LBOs) by private equity groups – shuts down for extended periods, this figure could double, the rating agency warned in a report.Moody’s declined to say which companies fell under its unrated universe, but fund managers said it probably included Alliance Boots, the biggest LBO in European history at £12.4bn. Overall, the UK represented the biggest part of the looming maturity wall, with €54bn of debts coming due over the next three years, the rating agency noted, followed by Germany and France.Ahead of the financial crisis, Europe’s dealmaking machine was driven mainly by banks and collateralised loan obligations– specialised vehicles set up to buy the debts used to finance LBOs. Bonds, which are more common in the US, were only occasionally used.Both components of the European leveraged finance market will struggle to refinance LBO debts that are coming up for repayment in the coming years. Banks are keener to prune their balance sheets than make new loans, while CLOs have a finite lifespan, and are starting to be constrained on backing new deals and refinancing old ones.“The markets have not yet devised a material loan product to replace existing CLOs and banks continue to shrink leveraged loan books,” Moody’s said.Many private equity-owned groups are large and healthy enough to be able to refinance old debts in the bond market, but the unrated market often suffers from weaker creditworthiness.More than half the €133bn of debt maturing by the end of 2015 had a Moody’s “credit estimate” score of 16 or weaker. These companies may face “particular challenges in terms of refinancing their debt”, the rating agency said. Almost a quarter had scores of 17 or weaker, which “implies a stressed capital structure”.The biggest refinancing challenges will be 2014 and 2015, Moody’s said. In both of these years there is about €30bn worth of debt maturing that has a score of 16 or weaker. “The 2014-15 refinancing peak remains large and worrisome given our expectations of protracted macroeconomic weakness, combined with the weak average credit quality of this universe,” it said.The credit rating agency’s prediction that a quarter of the 254 unrated European companies will default “sounds high”, said John Foy, head of leveraged finance at M&G. “Our portfolio is holding up relatively well. There are a few problems that may result in covenant resets, extensions or debt reductions, but nothing alarming.”It is clear many European companies are struggling with a combination of weak economic growth, deleveraging banks and bouts of market turmoil that in effect close down the junk bond market. This will increase the default rate on European groups rated below investment grade to 6 per cent by the end of the year, from about 2.3 per cent at the moment, Michael Hampden-Turner, a Citigroup analyst, said in a recent note.
129;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Alliance Boots defends tax bill;;Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, defended the amount of tax paid by the pharmaceutical wholesaler and retail chain as he revealed he was eyeing a merger rather than an initial public offering as an eventual exit for the company’s owners.Alliance Boots said on Wednesday that it paid £83m in cash tax, of which £26m was paid in the UK in the year to March 31, 2012. This compared with a £59m tax bill the previous year, with £10m paid in the UK.“It is not true that we are not paying taxes. We are just spending money in a way which has an effect on the taxes for good reasons,” said Mr Pessina.The group had benefited, he said, from a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 30 per cent five years ago to 26 percent, and had put more than £1bn into its pension schemes over the past five years.Adding these back would have more than doubled the UK cash tax bill from £26m to £72m, he said, more than the £42m of UK tax the group paid in its last year as a public company in 2006-07.Alliance Boots had also invested about £1bn in the UK over the past five years, generating tax relief.Mr Pessina, who took the group private five years ago with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in a £12.4bn deal, said a merger would be a better exit route for the group than a float.“An IPO could be an exit. I believe that a merger is the right exit. In a merger you have synergies and you can create real value,” he said.If the company could not strike a deal in the medium term, it could seek a listing, but it would “be some time before you see our company public again”.Mr Pessina recently told the Financial Times he was looking for another “transformational deal” with the US, Latin America or Asia in its sights.The comments came as Alliance Boots increased sales by 18.4 per cent to £23bn, while trading profit – excluding goodwill amortisation, exceptional items and joint ventures – rose 12.4 per cent to £1.2bn.However, pre-tax profit fell from £676m to £660m after higher finance costs. Net debt fell by £826m to £7bn. The shareholders did not take a dividend.Mr Pessina also played down the impact of Greece potentially leaving the Euro. “It would be a very emotional reaction and after the world will continue to rotate,” he said.Mr Pessina also said he had no intention of appointing a new chief executive after the departure of Andy Hornby in March 2011.He said the top team worked so well “my leadership is not indispensable”, although the 70-year-old said he did not intend to retire.
130;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-04-29T21:49:05Z;Alliance Boots out to cement its position;;Stefano Pessina is feeling a little under the weather.The fierce air conditioning that was a feature of his recent travels in US has left him with a nasty cold.But the executive chairman of Alliance Boots, who turned 70 last June, says he has no intention of slowing down.“The fact I have a cold today doesn’t mean that my health is very weak, and it doesn’t mean that I have decided not to work any more,” he says.At the point when many other executives are contemplating retirement, Mr Pessina has his sights set firmly on another “transformational deal”, of the type he has struck roughly every 10 years.This would cement the position of Alliance Boots as a truly global company, just five years after he acquired it with private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in a £12.4bn deal. Not only is it ready, but the global financial crisis has created opportunities for strong companies.“For us, being a global company is …not wishful thinking, it’s a project,” he says.To complete this project, he acknowledges that sooner or later, Alliance Boots must expand in the US.“If we want to become global, sooner or later we will have to do something there,” he says.Rumours have abounded in recent weeks that Alliance Boots is in talks with a US company. Some industry specialists believe a logical tie-up could be with McKesson, the US pharmaceutical wholesaler.Mr Pessina refuses to talk about specific companies.But he says he continues to talk to all parties in the market that might be prepared to sell or merge.While the US is an obvious hunting ground, Mr Pessina is also keen to expand in China, and Latin America.“We believe that the future will belong to the global players, and to be global you must be in the US, you must be in South America, you must be in Asia more generally, but specifically China,” he says.He points out that a “transformational deal” could be a merger, a partnership or an arrangement where the parties combine their buying power.Could a deal also be a route to an exit for Mr Pessina and KKR?“It could be for my partners if they wanted, but not for me,” he says. “Whatever we will do I will stay with the company, at least as a shareholder.”He believes KKR is in no hurry to exit.“Their average investment is seven years, but they have been 11 to 12 years with the same investment in the past,” he says.Some people who know the company believe it will be unlikely to pursue an initial public offering until Mr Pessina has struck another big deal.Mr Pessina believes KKR will remain relaxed “provided that we continue to grow and pay back some of the debt”.Alliance Boots is expected to continue its record of delivering double-digit growth in sales and trading profit, which excludes goodwill and exceptional items, in the year to the end of March. More than half of this will come from expansion.It is also continuing to reduce debt, helped by the £1bn-plus in cash it throws off each year. Last year it cut net debt by £546m to £7.8bn. The reduction is expected to be bigger in the year to March 2012.It could pay the £1bn or so that is due in 2014 from internally generated cash flow. It must refinance £5bn before June 2015, with another £1bn due in 2016, and £800m in 2017.“When we will decide to refinance it, we will not have any difficulties,” says Mr Pessina.He and KKR will again not pay themselves a dividend again this year.But progress at Alliance Boots has included controversy.Last year, the group incurred the wrath of pensions experts, after it wrote to 9,000 pensioners offering them an immediate increase in their pensions, in exchange for giving up future rises in line with inflation.Only about 10 per cent have accepted the offer. However, Mr Pessina defends the exercise.Alliance Boots had not sought to “cheat” anyone, and had provided information and independent financial advice.He also rails against critics of the group’s tax arrangements. It moved to Zug in Switzerland in 2008, and in the year to March 2011, enraged tax protesters by paying a tax bill of £59m on pre-tax profit of £637m.“The atmosphere in this country is becoming more and more negative for the companies, which is not good for the UK,” says Mr Pessina.The tax bill in the year to March 2011 reflected the additional £246m investment in the UK pension schemes, its borrowings and past losses, and the tax bill will be higher this year.Alliance Boots has also invested almost £1bn in the UK since being taken private.“We have tried to keep alive …our factory in Nottingham. It would have been much easier for us to shut down everything and go somewhere else. We have not done this,” says Mr Pessina. “We would hope to have fair treatment. I don’t ask for any privilege. Just a fair treatment in this country.”
131;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-04-29T20:04:04Z;Alliance Boots chief attacks UK tax regime;;Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, has launched a stinging attack on the climate for big business in the UK, warning that a relentless focus on tax could drive away global corporations.Mr Pessina also said that he was ready for another “transformational deal”, possibly in the US.While he welcomed moves by the UK government to cut the rate of corporation tax, he said: “The atmosphere of the country should be consistent with what the government is trying to do, and the general atmosphere of the country is really more and more against business.”Alliance Boots, the high street chemist chain and pharmaceuticals wholesaler, has been resident in Zug in Switzerland since shortly after Mr Pessina and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts took the group private in a £12.4bn deal in 2007.Last year the company came under fire from tax protesters including UK Uncut after it paid a tax bill of £59m on pre-tax profits of £637m.The UK government has pledged to crack down on tax avoidance, while at the same time attempting to construct a business-friendly tax regime.Mr Pessina warned that if the climate for business in the UK did not change, then “definitely” companies could consider moving elsewhere. He argued that if Alliance Boots was resident in the UK rather than Switzerland, it would pay “more or less the same amount of taxes”.The company’s tax bill was reduced last year by investment in its UK pension schemes, its £7.8bn of net debt and past losses, he said, adding that it would be higher this year. Alliance Boots has invested almost £1bn in the UK since being taken private.Mr Pessina said he was keen to do another big deal – as he had done about every 10 years – this time in the US, Asia or Latin America. The “transformational deal” could be an acquisition, a merger or an agreement with another company to combine purchasing operations.He refused to comment on any specific targets. Some industry specialists have suggested that a tie-up with McKesson, the US pharmaceuticals wholesaler, would be logical.In most parts of the world, potential targets would have both retail and pharmaceutical wholesale operations. However, in the US, Alliance Boots would have to choose between striking a deal with a pharmacy chain or wholesaler.Mr Pessina indicated that KKR was supportive. He declined to say whether the group had approached any rivals, or received any approaches itself.“When someone will be ready, it will come out quite naturally from the conversations that I have quite regularly,” he said.People familiar with the situation suggested that Mr Pessina and KKR were unlikely to list Alliance Boots without first agreeing another big deal. This was “the missing piece in the jigsaw”, they added.
132;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-04-12T23:01:52Z;Morrison in stores revamp;;Wm Morrison will on Friday announce a shake-up of its commercial division as the company prepares to revamp its supermarkets, expand its network of smaller stores and extend into areas such as clothing.Morrison will name Nick Collard, a rising star in the group, as marketing and operations director.Mr Collard was recruited just over a year ago from Boots, where he was brand director.He replaces Richard Lancaster, who is taking a role outside the supermarket sector, according to people familiar with the situation.Mr Lancaster was appointed marketing director in January 2011, succeeding Angus Maciver, the marketing director who had worked with Marc Bolland, Morrison’s former chief executive, to transform its image.Mr Collard, who is promoted from his position as grocery director at Morrison, will report to Richard Hodgson, Morrison’s commercial director, who oversees the group’s ­marketing.In his new role, Mr Collard will decide which products and offers Morrison highlights to customers through advertising and material in stores.People close to the situation said Mr Collard, one of a clutch of executives recruited by Dalton Philips, chief executive, in January 2011, was a high flyer in the group.The grocery division had performed well over the past year, they added.“It is definitely a bigger role within the company,” said one person with knowledge of the situation.Morrison said: “We are delighted Nick is moving into the marketing and operations director role, reporting to Richard Hodgson.“He has a great record in his first 15 months at Morrison and is a highly rated marketeer. He’s one of our rising stars.”As part of the shake-up, Mike Snell, who is director of Morrison’s non-food business, will take on all Morrison’s non-food operations, aside from clothing.He adds health and beauty to his roster of responsibilities, including home and leisure, petrol, dry cleaning, photographic and household categories.Tim Bettley was last month named Morrison’s first commercial director for clothing.The former Peacocks executive, who has worked with Morrison for some time, takes up his role imminently. Mr Snell and Mr Bettley will also report to Mr Hodgson.The changes come as Morrison prepares to revamp stores, taking into account the results of trials of its enhanced fresh-food range, and moves to free space in stores, some of which could be used to sell a wider range of non-food products.But Mr Philips has said he expects Morrison’s non-food expansion to be primarily through the internet, building on its acquisition of Kiddicare, the online baby goods retailer, a year ago.The changes in the commercial division are the latest at Morrison.It recently moved four senior executives into Kiddicare as it prepares to expand it into a full online non-food business in the final quarter of this year.
133;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Much at stake for Co-op as talks teeter;;Just before Christmas, Lloyds Banking Group was confident the sale of 630 branches would be stitched up by this weekend.While the business had not attracted the level of interest it was hoping for, Lloyds had selected the Co-operative Group as its preferred bidder – a popular choice in government and consumer circles – and said that it expected to secure terms for a deal in the first quarter.Three months later the talks are hanging in the balance, with both sides playing down expectations that a deal will be reached.At stake is not only a straightforward exit for Lloyds from the business it must sell to meet state aid rules but also a rare opportunity to create a serious competitor to the big five banks, say consumer groups.Should the Co-op fail to agree a deal with Lloyds, the mutual would return to slower organic growth, picking up branches where it can and extending banking services in its grocery stores.Reaching the kind of scale it would instantly achieve through the Lloyds purchase – 1,000 branches compared with its current 340 – without a big acquisition could take decades.Meanwhile the Lloyds business would either be floated or sold off to NBNK, an investment vehicle that would be keen to reopen talks after its bid for the branches was rejected last year.Either way, without an existing banking arm to merge the Lloyds branches into, hopes are fading that this business could create a viable competitor for consumers.A review by Sir John Vickers’ banking commission last year said that to compete effectively banks need at least 6 per cent of the current account market.As a standalone business the Lloyds branches would have about 4.6 per cent, less than Santander UK and Nationwide but more than other building societies.“It’s clear this is the deal everyone wants,” says someone familiar with the process. “But the government can’t force it.”While the Co-op’s bid has the support of ministers and consumer lobbyists, the regulator is taking a tougher stance.Anxious that it does not wave through any more banking deals that blow-up shortly after they are approved, the Financial Services Authority is considering whether it should regulate the Co-op’s entire business if it buys the Lloyds branches.This would pose stringent capital requirements on not just the mutual’s banking arm but also its grocery chain, funeral parlours, pharmacies and other smaller businesses.For a group that is already struggling to compete with large retailers such as Tesco and Boots, this would be a disaster.Having to hold a larger capital buffer would restrict the funds available to the Co-op for expanding its other businesses and could put further pressure on already squeezed profit margins, according to people close to the situation. Simply put, if the regulator does take this view, it is likely to kill the Co-op’s plans.The mutual’s chief executive said on Thursday that discussions were continuing and a final decision would be made in the coming weeks.He made clear that he would only push ahead if the deal was beneficial for members who have a stake in the whole organisation, not just the bank.Should the talks collapse, Lloyds would probably resort to its back-up plan of floating the branch network – an option analysts say carries more risk that a clean sale.This would make Lloyds solely responsible for carving out the branch network as an independent business, ensuring it had fully-functional systems and a robust management team and board.Lloyds would also face the uncertainty of pricing a float in a difficult market and convincing private investors to back a bank that had failed to attract a buyer.“It’s an issue of valuation,” says Robert Law, an analyst at Nomura. “The fewer options Lloyds has to choose from, the lower the price is likely to be.”Also, he says, without a firm bidder Lloyds may have to improve the asset package, by including better quality mortgages, for example, to attract private investors.Lloyds’ priority throughout the process has been to limit the execution risk of a deal rather than extract the highest price.Analysts warn that failing to agree terms with the Co-op would leave the bank in a weak negotiating position and having to shoulder all the risk.
134;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-02-27T22:47:49Z;Visa in partnership with Vodafone;;Visa, the world’s largest payment processor, has announced a “worldwide partnership” with UK telecoms group Vodafone that will allow mobile phone customers to pay for goods and services using their handset.The mobile wallet service will be available across all 30 countries that Vodafone operates in, starting with the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey.Initially customers will be required to set up a pre-paid account in order to make payments, but the platform will be opened up to other financial institutions that offer Visa in the future, according to Mary Carol Harris, head of mobile at Visa Europe.The gradual shift away from cash boosted Visa Europe’s revenue 15 per cent last year, to £1bn, and the group identified electronic banking services as the future of payments.Visa’s partnership with the Vodafone is the latest in a stream of deals between telecom groups and the financial services industry to launch services that will allow customers to use their smartphone as a way to access their money.Google, PayPal, Orange and Barclaycard have all staked a claim on the new market, but the number of handsets equipped with the necessary technology remains limited.Retailers have also been wary of installing the readers necessary for contactless payment by phone, although chains such as retailer Alliance Boots and McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues, have now introduced terminals.Card issuers have made the transaction charges less than those for credit or debit card payments, but retailers are unsure if this situation will last.Retailers which install readers pay a lower merchant service charge per transaction than that charged for debit or credit cards, but Sarah Cordey at the British Retail Consortium questioned how long this would last.“At the moment it’s an incentive for trials,” she said. “We will be keeping an eye on how the charges levied by the banks for retailers that allow customers to pay with mobile phones develop in the future.”Providers are now working to educate customers, who have expressed concern at the security of using their phone in place of their wallet. Orange recently launched a new incentive scheme to encourage its customers to use their phones to make payments, offering “Quick Tap Treats” such as coffee or baguettes in restaurant chain Eat.“There are not very many live users yet,” said Sandra Quinn at the UK Payments Council, which co-ordinates payment systems. “It has not been an industry-wide scheme, but perhaps now it’s time has come. Customers need time to get used to the idea of using the phone for payments.”Visa plans to use the London Olympics later this year to showcase mobile phone technology, linking up with Samsung to offer athletes and visitors the chance to purchase goods at the games with their phone.
135;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-01-22T16:51:09Z;Growth spurt for baby goods start-ups;Bigger operators are suffering but start-ups are finding their feet;Mothercare’s troubles have cast a pall over the UK nursery products market. But not all companies in the sector are struggling.JoJo Maman Bébé, an independent retailer based in South Wales, announced plans this month to open 12 UK stores in addition to the 42 it currently operates. The company, which opened the new stores in cities including Glasgow and Chester, employs 400 people and expects to take on 80 more this year.In the south-west, a group of small but fast-growing start-ups has created a self-styled “baby cluster”. The group comprises 10 companies with a collective turnover of £17m. With support from UK Trade and Investment they meet every two months to swap notes on trade fairs, patents lawyers and other trade intelligence.Rob Law, founder and chief executive of Magmatic, the Bristol-based owner of the award-winning Trunki ride-on children’s suitcase, says: “We don’t feel threatened by each other. It’s an opportunity to be open and friendly among peers.”Many of the companies are husband-and-wife management teams often spurred into action by the experience of having children themselves.Julia Minchin runs Hippychick in Bridgwater with her husband Jeremy, a former detective with the Metropolitan Police in London.After their first child, she was trying to track down the makers of a baby sling a friend had. “I rang the German manufacturers as a buyer. The next thing I knew I was their UK distributor,” she says.Mintel, the market research company, puts the size of the baby and nursery products market in the UK at £750m. It projects it to grow by a fifth to £900m by 2015. Mothercare is the largest specialist retailer, but it has been hit by online competition and recorded an £18.5m loss for the six months to June 31. Store groups such as Tesco, Boots, John Lewis and Wm Morrison have all entered the market.Industry experts say the UK baby boom has played a key role in underpinning the strong sales growth. “We watch the birth rate closely, but probably not as desperately as the local private schools,” jokes Mrs Minchin.But Mintel says the birth rate, after growing steadily in 2005-08, has levelled off. As consumers become more cautious, margins will come under pressure as retailers continue to discount prices to maintain or increase market share.“The already competitive market conditions are likely to become even more intensely price-competitive as Tesco expands its presence in nursery goods,” Mintel says.Laura Tenison founded JoJo Maman Bébé in 1993 and it now has sales of about £30m. She says the best thing she did was not saddle the company with debt during the good times. She says banks were very keen to lend. “We could have asset financed every shop,” she recalls.But instead, in 2011, she took an outsider investor – Magenta Partners, the private equity company founded by Tom Singh, who also founded of New Look.Mr Law, who designed Trunki for a nationwide competition while a student at Northumbia University, has also taken on an angel investor expressly to be able to spend money on innovation on new products.“The big companies are cutting back on their R&D spend. We spot an opportunity,” says Mr Law, 33, who was rebuffed when he took his invention on Dragon’s Den, the BBC programme which attempts to pick the start-ups of the future.Hippychick, a manufacturer and distributor, is also having to reassess how it can expand the business and still keep control. “If you go to the bank they’ll want you to trade finance and invoice discount.Mrs Minchin says: “Having been in that position in a previous business, I think invoice discounting isn’t necessarily the way forward. But if our key customers become any bigger, we may have little choice.”She and her husband own the company outright, but they have talked about taking on outside investors. The first step, she says, is to establish a proper board. And there has been interest from would-be advisers, she adds.When her husband had to take time off last year after a powergliding accident in the Himalayas, she was inundated with unsolicited calls. “There were about three ex-Goldman Sachs guys who live down here who got in touch,” she says.This article has been altered from the original version to correct the name of Magenta Partners and to note that it was founded by Tom Singh.
136;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-01-20T04:54:18Z;Positive effects of PE’s involvement;;From Mr Tim Hames.Sir, It was disappointing to read Louis Brennan’s comments regarding private equity (Letters, January 17), accusing it of destroying businesses and “grand larceny”. In particular the idea that private equity breaks contracts is laughable. The corporate governance structure of private equity means that the investors and the management team work closely together on all aspects of the running of a business, from financial arrangements right through to supply chains and HR. Private equity executives are never in a position, even if they wanted to be, where they can simply break a contract.And the remarks surrounding disclosure, or lack thereof as Prof Brennan protests, flies in the face of all the evidence. While it is fair to say there is still work to be done, the industry has made great strides in openness over the last five years to the point that the reporting standards of our biggest investments are equal to, and in some cases better than, their equivalents on the FTSE 350.To accuse private equity of contributing to social inequality is a claim that needs to be backed up by numbers, and I strongly suspect there are none. Instead private equity’s contribution to the economy, be it through consistently high returns to pension fund investors, growing existing businesses or rescuing companies from administration – as it did this week with Bonmarché – indicate that private equity has exactly the opposite effect to Prof Brennan’s claims. The positive effect private equity involvement can have on business is there for all to see – just look at Alliance Boots or Pets at Home. To throw around phrases such as “grand larceny” is ludicrous.Tim Hames, Strategy Director, British Private Equity & Venture Capital Association
137;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-01-15T20:38:10Z;Pharmacy to offer ‘intelligent medicines’;;"One of Britain’s leading high street pharmacy chains is to offer customers “intelligent medicines” that will allow them to better follow doctors’ orders and monitor their health.Lloydspharmacy has signed a deal with Proteus Biomedical, a Californian company, to sell pills containing edible microchips that communicate with a disposable monitoring patch attached to a patient’s shoulder, in a service costing about £50 a month.The patch, which will receive signals from the swallowed microchip and monitor other bodily functions including sleep patterns, heart rate and posture, will transmit the information to mobile phones and computers owned by the patient or their carers.The action marks the latest effort by healthcare providers to boost compliance with medical regimes and improve outcomes for chronic conditions such as heart problems and diabetes.However, it could also raise concerns over privacy and raises the prospect for greater two-tiered provision of healthcare, with the package – called Helius – being paid for by the consumer rather than the NHS.The initial package, set to be launched in September, will include a red placebo sugar pill containing a safe and soluble microchip developed by Proteus that patients swallow alongside their existing medicines; an adhesive patch to be changed once a week; and data support.Currently, many patients are poorly treated for their diseases, in part because they fail to take their medicines as prescribed.Some estimates suggest half of patients do not take their medicines correctly, causing unnecessary medical complications and waste of prescribed but unused drugs which costs the NHS alone nearly £400m a year.Drug companies and health providers are increasingly trying to raise patient compliance levels through programmes including telephone counselling, nursing advice and patient support groups, but they are also starting to experiment with technological approaches.Andrew Thompson, chief executive of Proteus, said: “Retail is no longer about putting a product on a shelf and hoping someone will buy it. It’s about customers shifting from purchasing products to services.”Neither he nor Lloydspharmacy would disclose the commercial terms of the deal, but they said it would involve a sharing of costs and profits and was exclusive for the coming three years.Steve Gray, Lloydspharmacy’s healthcare services director, said: “Our drive is to improve health and outcomes.”While patients will initially pay for the package, he said several NHS units had expressed interest in using the service, notably for monitoring complex and costly treatments such as organ transplant rejection therapies.Proteus has already signed a partnership with Novartis, the Swiss drug company, to place edible microchips onto its blood pressure drug Diovan, and has launched studies in the US and the UK for its application in diabetes, organ transplants, mental health and tuberculosis."
138;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2012-01-08T22:35:36Z;UK retail sector set to shrink further;;The anticipated pre-pack administration of Blacks Leisure on Monday will mark the 26th retailer to exit the London Stock Exchange in the past five years, but more are likely to follow as 2012 progresses.Blacks is set to be subsumed by listed peer JD Sports in a £20m ($30.8m) deal, but the 25 names that have left the quoted sector since 2007 include high street chains such as Woolworths that have collapsed into administration, companies such as Alliance Boots that were taken private, and indebted retailers forced into debt-for-equity swaps, such as Jessops, the camera equipment retailer.Their absence, combined with an average share price decline of 40 per cent for the remaining constituents, has caused the value of non-food retailers in the FTSE 350 retail index to halve during the same period.Excluding the major supermarkets, the combined market capitalisation of retailers in the index currently stands at £24bn, a 55 per cent fall on the £53bn recorded when the index peaked in May 2006.Blacks, which had a market capitalisation of just £1m when its shares were suspended last week, is one of a growing number of “micro cap” retailers including HMV, Game Group and Clinton Cards which remain listed, but have dropped out of the FTSE 350 following share price falls of up to 90 per cent in the past year.“These retailers have all experienced structural problems, often with no obvious ‘fix’ for the core business, at a time of extreme margin compression across the retail sector,” said Andy Wade, analyst at Numis Securities who has been charting the changes to the index.“Although it’s difficult to make a direct comparison, global peers in the online retail sector such as Amazon have performed very strongly over the same five-year period.”Additionally, the major food retailers have a combined market capitalisation of about £47bn – roughly the same level as 2006 – and are all busy increasing their share of non-food sales at the expense of general retailers.Although there have been some high-profile failures of retail initial public offerings such as New Look, Mr Wade points out that many retailers have successfully listed since 2007, including Sports Direct International, Dunelm, SuperGroup and Ocado.Nick Bubb, the independent retail analyst, says the shrinking index is “partly structural and partly cyclical”.“The weaker players now often used to be bigger companies, but disappearing profits and rising debts take an inevitable toll on equity value,” he says.“It is unfortunate that a lot of the small caps now are in the entertainment retail sector, where Amazon and the supermarkets have been formidable competitors.“Usually after retail death there is life, in that new companies will emerge to float and take up the running, but the IPO market is even more dead than the ‘living dead’ like HMV and JJB Sports.”JJB Sports, which is in effect owned by just four investors, shifted its listing to the Alternative Investment Market (Aim), after it narrowly escaped administration last year, in order to save tens of thousands of pounds in costs.Other shrunken or severely indebted retailers have been picked off by specialist private equity houses, notably Sun European Partners, which has acquired small listed retailers Alexon and Jacques Vert in recent months as it expands into the “grey fashion” market targeting older female shoppers.However, dire conditions on the high street mean that many of the remaining retail micro caps have little hope of attracting further investment from their existing shareholders, let alone coming on to the radar of institutional fund managers.“The institutions shun anything on the stock market that is too illiquid,” adds Mr Bubb.“This means that it is easy to short the shares of any retailer that is in trouble, with collapsing share prices compounding the pressures on management.”All that boards can do is attempt to manage the decline, as seen at HMV, which is slowly selling off assets such as its live music venues in an effort to shore up its balance sheet.And the smaller that companies get, the more the decline among retail analysts in following them: according to Mr Bubb. “The smaller that companies get, the more complicated they get.”
139;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-11-18T17:56:42Z;Lunch with the FT: Henry Kravis and George Roberts;The co-founders of private equity group KKR share an Indian takeaway with Henny Sender;"Henry Kravis and his cousin George Roberts won’t go out to lunch with me. The co-founders of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the world’s best-known corporate buy-out company, will, however, allow me to pay for the Indian takeaway they have had delivered to KKR’s Hong Kong office, one of 14 outposts of the New York-based private equity group. Worldwide, more than one million people work in companies in which KKR invests, among them the US hospital chain HCA and the British pharmacy and healthcare group Alliance Boots.A receptionist escorts me into a conference room high up in a tower that has some of the most expensive rents in Hong Kong. The meal is already on the table, and I am told that the cousins are on their way. I am expecting to see plastic containers, but the food has already been transferred on to fine Wedgwood porcelain. Our places have been set with linen napkins, embroidered with the KKR initials.Roberts arrives shortly afterwards, looking very banker-like in a pinstriped suit with a pink shirt and an aubergine silk tie. Aubergine has become KKR’s corporate colour, he says, offering me a new business card with the company logo in that same shade. A few minutes later Kravis appears, wearing a white shirt and checked tie, with a striking gold tiepin.Both Kravis, 67, and Roberts, 68, are diminutive and spry. They greet each other warmly, even though they have been apart for just a couple of hours. Theirs is a genuinely close relationship (for example, Kravis donated a Central Park bench in his cousin’s name). The familiarity allows them to describe the massive KKR, now a publicly listed company with almost 900 employees and $60bn under management, as a “family-run firm”.Kravis offers me a drink, getting it himself rather than ask the three catering staff who are standing by. I ask for sparkling water, which is poured with care. Roberts asks for a Diet Coke, which Kravis hands over with rather less ceremony.We are on the 56th floor, with breathtaking views of the harbour. Lunch has taken months to set up because the two men are rarely in the same place at the same time. Kravis lives in New York, and Roberts on the US west coast. When they are together they dine out, accompanied by their wives. They like to be incognito, exploring local, sometimes fairly downmarket, restaurants. (I had run into both couples two days before our lunch. All four were casually dressed and on their way to a low-key Sichuanese restaurant.) Kravis says he has chosen our food, telling me that he and his wife love India and its cuisine. “Marie-Josée and I like to go to India for Christmas but this time I will be there on January 6 for my birthday. We go to temples even Indians have never heard of.”Kravis and Roberts founded KKR in 1976. Their co-founder was an older man, Jerome Kohlberg, whose name has stuck but who left Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 1987, the year before the audacious $25bn RJR Nabisco buy-out deal that made the company famous. It’s a tale told in the bestselling – and still thrilling – 1990 book, Barbarians at the Gate (extract below). It captures the cut-throat world of 1980s Wall Street, a time when anything could, and did, happen as the traditional way of doing business was turned on its head by upstarts such as KKR.Both Kravis and Roberts had originally worked for Kohlberg at the scrappy, aggressive investment group Bear Stearns in New York, Kravis joining to replace his cousin who had gone back to live in California. At KKR, the three men set up leveraged buy-outs of the kind they had pioneered at Bear Stearns. The separation from Kohlberg in 1987 was – and remains – painful. It was caused, in part, by differences between the hard-driving business style of the young cousins and the quieter approach of their former mentor; and partly by disagreements over money.KKR’s business model relies on buying companies using masses of borrowed money, and, once the takeover is complete, paying down that debt using cash flow from the companies it now owns. When it works, the upside is huge, and when it doesn’t it is usually the creditors who lose out. Because of this one-sidedness, and because the private equity companies can buy businesses using billions of dollars of borrowed cash (risking very little of their own money), the industry has long had an image problem. In its early days KKR made repeated, audacious and often successful bids for so many big companies that its name became synonymous with aggressive “barbarian” tactics.It is, I believe, the contrast between public perceptions of the pair as tough go-getters and the reality of my charming, courteous hosts in Hong Kong, that is part of the secret of the cousins’ enduring success in the private equity world.They have certainly worked to change perceptions of their company and make it more up to date. When I visited the KKR head office in New York some years ago, its walls were decorated with English hunting scenes and other traditional – and very expensive – paintings in gold frames. They have since decided to throw out the old look, and today the walls of KKR offices around the world are hung with modern paintings, often by local artists. Kravis has donated extensively, both in cash and in pictures, to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where Marie-Josée, Kravis’s third wife and an economist, serves as president of its board of trustees.I ask Roberts, the older of the two men by four months, and the more softly spoken, about the change in style. “We wanted to change the art and we wanted to change the way of thinking around KKR,” he replies – adding that the old stuff was sold at a profit.We sit down to eat, and Kravis carefully serves me my first helping, a dish of spinach with cheese, and then some curried potatoes. He explains that the tiepin is a gift from his brother and is a Victorian coin dating from 1864.“It is amazing you haven’t lost it yet,” Roberts observes, companionably, helping himself to some meat, which he wraps expertly in flatbread.Kravis and I both heap several more spoonfuls of the curries on to our plates. I notice that Roberts, who is less adventurous in both his travels and his eating habits – preferring the golf courses of the US’s west coast to the temples of India – seems to prefer the less spicy tandoori dishes.The office makeovers are also emblematic of the way the two founders have rejuvenated their business after a period, about a decade ago, in which they seemed more detached, when the firm was slightly adrift and there was speculation within financial circles on the touchy issue of succession. In July 2010, KKR followed the example of its rival private equity group Blackstone, and listed as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange.Over the years, KKR’s portfolio of companies has included Safeway, the battery maker Duracell, and, of course, the food and tobacco conglomerate RJR Nabisco. Today, most of the companies KKR bought in the boom that ended with the 2008 financial crisis are surviving, although its single largest deal, the utility Texas Energy Future Holdings, the former TXU, is still very troubled.Kravis is confident that KKR and the private equity industry will weather the economic storms. “If investors can live with the illiquidity, and wait five to seven years to harvest their investment, private equity will still offer the highest returns,” he says. “All our funds are above cost and returning money, even those that aren’t fully invested.”The Asian operation is the fastest-growing part of KKR’s business and has just moved into these offices, having outgrown smaller premises in the five years since the firm raised $4bn to invest in Asian companies and, more recently, $1bn to fund young Chinese firms. Kravis is often in Asia on business, partly to nurture relationships with his investors there, who range from the most experienced in the region, such as Singapore’s Government Investment Corporation, to some of the newest, such as South Korea’s National Pension Scheme. (KKR recently teamed up with the latter to invest in Colonial Pipeline in the US.)The cousins are here this week to help local staff raise $6bn for a new Asian fund. KKR has a much shorter track record in Asian markets than competitors such as Carlyle (which has already returned $8bn in profits to investors in its Asian businesses) but seems likely to do well. It has already invested in many companies in the region, among them a dairy company in Maanshan (“We own 110,000 cows,” Kravis says proudly); a finance firm in Shanghai; a beer company in South Korea and a chain of coffee houses in India.Heading the Asian operation is Joe Bae, a Korean-American whom KKR installed in 2005, when Bae was only 33. “But, then, we were only 32 when we founded KKR,” Kravis recalls. “At that time [35 years ago] we weren’t partners of anything, except each other.” Roberts says that back then the pair were, like Bae is now, “young, entrepreneurial, but cautious”. Meanwhile David Liu, who runs KKR’s Chinese business, is the only China regional head among the major buy-out firms who actually lives in the country.Kravis and Roberts say their biggest challenge is to resist bureaucracy in KKR on one hand, and to fight the arrogance of some younger colleagues on the other. One senior KKR executive used to insist on having a baby grand piano in every hotel room he stayed in, regardless of cost. That sort of practice is no longer tolerated. “The point isn’t to show that you are the smartest guy in the room,” says Kravis. “Arrogance kills.”While KKR has spawned many imitators over the years, its own corporate culture has struck me as less hard core capitalist than its Barbarians at the Gate image. The founders have shared the profits of their firm from its very first days. After flotation, 70 per cent of the company is owned by staff, while 30 per cent has gone to public shareholders.Roberts puts down his fork, but Kravis helps himself to some more lamb curry and rice as he tells me how KKR explains to all its employees, including support staff and secretaries, why it is better to hold on long term for a share of profits – even though the returns can take years to materialise, “They’d say, ‘Can’t we have a $1,000 gift certificate to Bloomingdales instead?’” Individual staff got $80,000 in profits from the pair’s first deal completed without Kohlberg – a $2.4bn investment in Storer Communications.The buy-out industry has changed a lot since the two men engineered their takeover of RJR Nabisco. To finance that deal the two went around the world, trying, for example, to convince a group of Japanese investors and banks to cough up $6bn for the total $19bn in debt they needed.More than two decades later, KKR’s rivals Blackstone and Carlyle are much bigger companies, but this “family-run firm” is still thriving: Kravis came in at 86th on the 2011 Forbes list of the richest Americans, and Roberts 91st. Each has an estimated worth of more than $3bn.Kravis has ordered a lot of food, and after two hours we haven’t made much of a dent either in the mounds of tandoori meats or the bowls of curry. Kravis has some coffee, Roberts chooses tea, but I decline anything to drink, apart from sparking water, much to Kravis’s distress.When they have finished, Roberts tells me he is flying later in the afternoon, “on Roberts Airlines”, he says in passing, while Kravis says he is flying – also by private jet – to New York late that night.In the past month Kravis has spent only a day and a half in New York. On this trip they have had 61 meetings. “I have been going to Asia since 1978,” Kravis says. “The first time I went to China was in 1993 with the Council on Foreign Relations. But Marie-Josée has been going to China since 1971.” That was the year before Nixon’s famous visit, I note.Both men see me to the lift and say they are looking forward to seeing the interview in the FT. “Better to describe us as iconic than as legends,” Roberts counsels me, deadpan. “You have to die to be described as a legend.”Henny Sender is the FT’s chief correspondent, international finance……………………………………………………………..Rang Mahal83 Percival St, Causeway Bay, Hong KongTakeaway food, to share:Potato samosasOnion bhajisTandoori mixed grillNavratan (vegetable) kormaLamb rogan joshChicken masalaSag paneer (cheese and spinach)Assorted breadsRaita (yoghurt sauce)Rice (pilau and plain steamed)Total (including free delivery) HK$698 (£57)……………………………………………………………..EDITED EXTRACT FROM ‘BARBARIANS AT THE GATE’Turf wars on Wall StreetIn 1976, Jerome Kohlberg, Henry Kravis and George Roberts decided to resign from Bear Stearns and set up their own specialist firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.When Kohlberg announced their intention to resign, Roberts flew in from San Francisco to tell Cy Lewis personally. The chairman of Bear Stearns was a large, imposing man, and as Roberts delivered the bad news, Lewis leaned way over his huge desk. “You know, young man,” he said, “you’re making a terrible mistake. No one has ever left this firm and been successful.”Then things got nasty. A few mornings later, Kravis walked in and found his office emptied, its door locked. A tall man in paratrooper boots stormed up to him.“You will not be in that office,” the man said in a German accent.“What do you mean?” Kravis said. “I’m a partner here.”A similar “hit man” arrived in San Francisco. The contents of Roberts’s office were saved only by the timely intervention of his west coast colleagues. Dumbstruck, Kohlberg and Kravis confronted Lewis. “What the hell’s going on?” Lewis had declared war on the traitorous trio. On their departure, he demanded that Bear Stearns retain control of all Kohlberg’s deals, even though the three had millions of their own money sunk into them and, in most cases, controlled the companies’ boards. Lewis attempted to apply pressure through Kolhberg’s investors, including insurance giant Prudential and the midwestern bank First Chicago. “But the Pru told him to ‘shove it’, and so so did First Chicago,” Kravis recalled. Eventually lawyers were brought in and, in a long, difficult negotiation, the trio kept control of its investments.They set up shop in the old Mutual of New York building on Fifth Avenue. Kohlberg preferred a low profile, so for years there was no name on the door.Edited extract from ‘Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco’ (1990) by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar (Arrow £9.99)."
140;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-11-15T22:46:33Z;Experiments in enterprise;Rob Hardy believes Aesica’s success proves British manufacturing can thrive;Being a big company man seemed to suit Rob Hardy. He did not even balk when his first employer, Boots, issued strict dress code guidance – grey or blue pinstripes and white shirt – for employees visiting its Nottingham headquarters back in the 1980s.Joining Boots after completing his PhD and climbing the management ladder seemed the obvious career path. “I was a chemist, I loved chemistry,” he says. “I wasn’t a tiger in a cage trying to get out.”Today, Mr Hardy can make his own rules. He is founder and chief executive of Aesica Pharmaceuticals, one of the UK’s fastest growing companies. It is focused on manufacturing and development at a time when the UK is striving to rebalance its economy on such activities. And it is headquartered in north-east England where a shrinking public sector makes private sector growth all the more urgent.Aesica is not, however, a name the general public would recognise. Its business model, like those of big pharmaceutical companies, is to sell its products to customers who then sell under their own brand names. Its Newcastle headquarters is similarly self-effacing: the third floor of an anonymous office block on a business park on the edge of the city.Mr Hardy, bespectacled and soberly suited, seems remarkably affable and relaxed for a man spearheading global growth. “It’s the drugs,” he laughs.Back in 1996, when Boots Pharmaceuticals was sold to BASF, the German chemicals group, the big-company man had simply adapted and ended up running BASF’s UK pharmaceutical operations. He moved to Northumberland to restore a lossmaking fine chemicals plant to strong profitability. “That was one of the easiest things I’d done in my career,” he says. “I was expecting a pat on the back from BASF for doing such an excellent job.”As big pharmaceutical companies outsource manufacturing, it means plenty of potential acquisitions for Aesica. Rob Hardy requires at least two of “four pillars” to be met.●Strategic partnerships. Acquire not just plants, but also long-term relationships with big pharma customers and thereby contracts. “If you aren’t a strategic partner, you are unlikely to be awarded business.”●New product technology. Aesica wants to be a full-service provider, so is keen to fill gaps in its offerings.●Global operations. Aesica is focusing on international growth. It is seeking an Indian site for active pharmaceutical ingredients and a US site for formulated products.●Organic growth. “I would never buy anything I didn’t think we could run better than the former incumbent.”Instead, BASF decided to sell the plant. He found himself, at 44, applying for jobs while, at BASF’s request, showing the revitalised site to potential purchasers. One was an American entrepreneur. “He said: ‘I won’t do it unless you stay,’” says Mr Hardy. A thought struck him: “Why don’t I do it myself?”Today Aesica, the business that resulted, has plants in the UK, Germany and Italy, is hunting for acquisitions in the US and India, employs 1,300 people and exports globally. It aims to become the prime supplier to the global pharmaceutical industry of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) – the active chemicals in drugs – and formulated products. These range from pills and syringes to creams and liquids. Turnover has increased from £25m in 2004 to £90m in 2010. It is targeted to reach £300m in 2014. The business is also highly profitable.Aesica’s name – taken from a Roman fort on Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland – both honours local roots and works overseas. The company now supplies most of the world’s top 10 pharma companies with drugs that help treat depression, pain, Aids and arthritis.Recession does not appear to be an issue for Aesica. People take medication despite economic difficulties, and its customers place long-term contracts, giving Aesica clarity for up to seven years ahead.The group’s global growth ambitions have just been reinforced financially by a new relationship with Silverfleet Capital, a European private equity firm, replacing LDC, its original partner. Silverfleet estimates that global outsourcing of pharmaceutical manufacturing was worth $44bn in 2010 and is forecast to grow at 7 per cent a year. Like LDC before it, Silverfleet owns 60 per cent of Aesica and the management team 40 per cent, half of which is Mr Hardy’s stake.Astonishingly, all this has been masterminded by a man who, barely eight years ago, had to ring the local authority’s business development manager to ask how to do a management buy-out.In truth, Mr Hardy, son of a Cumbrian scaffolder, was not an archetypal company man. “I didn’t like bosses,” he recalls. “My ideal boss was always 1,000 miles away.”To reinvent himself as an entrepreneur, he drew on his industry knowledge, international experience and plant turnround expertise. But he had no MBO experience. For example, he says, he had no idea how a multimillion-pound deal would be structured. He recalls telling PwC, the professional services firm, at the outset that he had a big problem: “I actually haven’t got any money – I can’t even pay you.”BASF, however, said: “We don’t do MBOs,” Mr Hardy says. But by now he had discovered his inner tiger.BASF did eventually relent but, Mr Hardy observes wryly, it “did the best deal of anybody I’ve ever bought from”. The sale price of about £25m hinged on a product that took longer to approve than anticipated.While it took the MBO team a year to clinch the deal, they realised within six months their strategy of making just generic APIs, was flawed. “At £25m [annual sales] we were just too small,” says Mr Hardy.Aesica wanted to move into contract manufacturing for big pharma companies, but winning them over was tough. The solution was to buy sites from potential customers and continue to make their products for them while boosting output with other work. Aesica can sell to everybody, whereas big pharma competitors rarely sell to each other.The big pharma trend to outsource manufacturing and, increasingly, development of new products has brought ample opportunities. In 2006, Aesica bought Mercks’s API manufacturing site in London and moved into making formulated products by acquiring a site from Abbott, another big healthcare company. The goal of becoming a full-service provider meant it needed to offer early-stage development and clinical trials expertise, so it acquired R5 in Nottingham. And this year, Aesica made its first overseas acquisition, buying two manufacturing sites in Germany and one in Italy, from UCB, the Belgian group.Mr Hardy’s acquisition philosophy is clear. “Any idiot can downsize a site and take out cost. The most difficult thing is actually growing a business.” Expansion, he says, is key: “I can’t shrink Aesica to greatness.”Mr Hardy admits it has not all been easy. Aesica closed the former Merck plant in 2010 after volumes dropped. This brought back echoes of his latter years at BASF, which entailed a lot of rationalisation and plant closures. “Sometimes you have to make very difficult decisions for the long-term future of the business,” he says.But people wrongly assume, he says, that costs are too high to make manufacturing feasible in the UK. “Nobody in Germany says we can’t compete because we are too expensive. We need to start selling ourselves a bit more.”
141;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-11-06T05:03:37Z;Boots’ bonds architect on the merits of switching;John Ralfe explains his role in Boots’ move to switch pension assets into bonds;"Ten years ago, the news broke that the £2.3bn ($3.7bn) Boots pension scheme had switched all of its assets into bonds. From a position of 75 per cent equities and 25 per cent short-dated bonds, over 18 months it moved to being 100 per cent in long-dated, high-quality bonds, a quarter of which were index linked. The index-linked proportion was later raised to 50 per cent.Actually, the news was leaked by John Ralfe, then head of corporate finance at Boots and architect of the revolutionary move, who felt there was no point in having effected the change if no one knew about it. Once it had completed the switch Boots was dithering about making an official announcement, he says, “because it was aware the move to bonds would be dynamite. They were worried the City would say ‘those people at Boots are just bonkers’.”That was more or less the reaction, because it was such a challenge to convention. It directly opposed the hallowed assumptions that equities outperform bonds over the longer term and offer a better hedge against inflation; that diversification is the first rule of sensible portfolio allocation; and that active fund management is a skill worth paying for.But Mr Ralfe, now an independent consultant, was not steeped in these investment beliefs. To the contrary, he had been heavily influenced by a 1997 paper written by Jon Exley, Shyam Mehta and Andrew Smith: The financial theory of defined benefit pension schemes. This argued for applying a financial economics analysis to corporate pension provision, and in particular for using a mark to market valuation approach rather than the traditional actuarial one.Perhaps more pertinently, it also maintained that, leaving aside tax and other considerations, “there is no specific reason to suppose that one asset class is preferred for the pension fund over any other”.Born: 19561978 Balliol College, Oxford (philosophy, politics & economics, first class hons)1980 Kings College, Cambridge (graduate economics)1980 Credit trainee and marketing banking products, Chase Manhattan Bank1984 Executive, marketing and syndicated credits, SG Warburg1986 Manager, marketing syndicated credits, Swiss Bank Corporation1989 Director, advised companies on treasury management, Ernst & Young1991 Head of corporate finance, The Boots Company2003 Adviser to companies & trustees on pensions, John Ralfe ConsultingAround the same time, Mr Ralfe was co-opted onto a pensions working party set up following a tax change to the taxation of dividends in 1997 and began taking an interest in the Boots pension fund.It became clear, he says, “that nobody was really managing the Boots pension scheme”, from the point of view of the risk it represented to the company in terms of its contribution liability.There was also no consideration of tax efficiency, with a view to maximising shareholder value.“The crucial part of the whole process, often forgotten, is the idea that if you reduce risk in the pension scheme you can then increase risk on balance sheet through more debt, which is tax efficient. So the Boots £300m share buyback was always in my mind from the very first day.” The buy-back was announced in March 2002.This is different from the liability-driven investment approach advocated by investment consultants, says Mr Ralfe, where the aim is for assets to match or outperform liabilities. There is no consideration of whether that approach is good or bad for shareholders.Mr Ralfe’s logic has not found favour with other pension schemes. The only other pension scheme to have moved entirely to bonds (95 per cent in index-linked gilts) is that of the Bank of England, which does not have shareholders.But he may have paved the way for the acceptance of buy-outs as a means for companies to remove pension scheme risk from the balance sheet, where an insurer takes on a pension fund’s assets and liabilities.Mr Ralfe, who was sacked by Boots in 2002, says he has been surprised at the way buy-outs have taken off. “I didn’t think you would get enough finance directors to say, we’re getting the chequebook out, in order to shift this deficit we have to put in £200m or £500m, or whatever. I just thought that would be too difficult a decision to have to take.”This was based on his own experience of persuading decision-makers at Boots to allow the switch to bonds.“I knew how difficult it was to get the non-executive directors at Boots to say, we are prepared to do something out of line with what everybody else is doing and will see us being heavily criticised.”He got them there in stages. “The first stage was a move to 50 per cent long-dated matching bonds, and that made it more difficult for [those who objected] to say, this is outrageous, moving from 25 per cent to 50 per cent.”Implementation began in April 2000 and was complete by autumn. Phase two, going to 100 per cent bonds, involved more negotiation with the non-executives, but eventually started in early 2001 and was complete by summer.Mr Ralfe maintains this step-by-step approach remains a sensible approach to the issue of switching out of equities. He has not changed his mind about the efficacy of such a move, although he acknowledges it is easier to convince directors to start down this path if a pension fund is in surplus (as the Boots scheme was at the time of the switch).“None of the companies I have been working with have been in surplus. It’s about saying, do we feel comfortable with the current position of, say, 80 per cent equities – not really, so let’s start to move to 50/50. You don’t have to agree an endgame.”As for objections to switching to bonds due to the current low yields on index-linked gilts, Mr Ralfe points out people have been saying yields could not go lower for years, but they have. Quantitative easing is a factor, but the more important driver is demographics, as the baby boomers reach retirement age.“There is going to be major demand for bonds, especially index-linked bonds, for a long time.” Once the DB scheme legacy has gone through the system, which will take another 25 years, demand from individuals will take over. “We are still in the middle of a structural change where the world needs more bonds.”He does not see this structural change as a problem for the economy, opining that if DB schemes switch out of equities, scheme members will adjust their overall portfolio to take account of this.“The individual should therefore reverse the switch, ie sell bonds and buy equities to restore their preferred equity/bond split.”Does he have any regrets about his role in driving and publicising the Boots move, given that it eventually ended in his dismissal? Of course not, he says: “You have to do the right thing.”"
142;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-11-03T21:30:58Z;Absolutist King needs challenge from a City panel;MPs should embed an advisory panel in legislation;Eyebrows can be scary, as those of Denis Healey and Frida Kahlo proved. Beware also the circumflex forehead fur of macroprudential absolutist Sir Mervyn King. His vision of a Bank of England that intervenes unflinchingly to stem risks within banks harks back to days when the governor had only to raise an eyebrow to suppress racy lending.Sir Mervyn has told MPs that the Bank’s supervisory swat team, the Prudential Regulatory Authority, should have powers to order banks to cut gearing or raise transparency without reference to detailed rules. That contrasts with current policing by the Financial Services Authority, due for abolition in 2013, whose clipboard bearers enforce a 3,000 page rule book. The approach has merit, given that the FSA has been better at box-ticking than far-sighted risk control. Free-wheeling regulators might do better.But there are quibbles. The historic record of governors quizzically deflecting busts is patchy. Sir Mervyn’s competence as an eyebrow raiser is questionable, meanwhile. He failed to forestall the UK portion of the credit crunch as part of the discredited tripartite system of markets regulation. But a polarisation of blame after the event – quoted banks copped the bulk – has allowed the central banker to centralise regulatory power on Threadneedle Street.Accordingly, he has torpedoed proposals for an advisory panel of financial professionals to assist the PRA, preferring the soft option of ad hoc consultations with the City. MPs should embed the panel in legislation to increase the challenge to which the PRA is subjected. Otherwise the attitude of the regulator to the regulated may be “talk to the hand, because the eyebrow ain’t listening”.Tate modernIt’s certainly not chicken feed. Revenues from byproducts of ingredient processing that Tate & Lyle sells for animal foodstuffs rose more than one-third in the six months to end-September, writes Alison Smith, providing an extra £19m of income.That unexpectedly high figure for the former doyen of the sugar sector helped produce pre-tax profit ahead of analysts’ expectations. The shares rose about 5 per cent to close at 680½p.The byproducts bonus made lower-margin bulk ingredients the main force behind earnings growth, overshadowing the speciality food ingredients division that is the strategic focus of Javed Ahmed and his team.While this focus has yet to produce stellar profit increases at the smaller, higher-margin division, Mr Ahmed has a sound plan and some past successes to provide encouragement that it will come good. Tate is all the better for having sold last year the EU sugar business that was both a hallmark and a millstone. Similarly welcome is the rapid reduction in net debt, which stood at just £410m at the half-year.With analysts upgrading their full-year forecasts, Tate is on a p/e of 12-13 times for 2012. This is squarely in the middle of the shares’ long-term trading range. But given uncertainties surrounding the current sweetener pricing round and world economies it is hard to see what might lift the shares in the near term.Perishable pixie dustOne prominent investor of our acquaintance is worried by profits at a part-owned Chinese leisure business. They are too high, he says. Their acceleration does not suggest that Chinese growth is moderating as predicted. So he anticipates an economic crash. That prospect should also concern investors in the UK-listed companies who have sprinkled magic Chinese pixie dust on their shares as an antidote to European economic woes.The epicentre, catastrophists agree, would be residential property. An estimated 60m-70m of Chinese dwellings, about 10 per cent of the total, are speculatively built apartments. Many are not even fitted out. One can almost hear the chill wind whistling through these concrete shells.Big UK businesses with Chinese operations include Burberry, Michael Page, Kingfisher and Tesco. On Thursday Unilever trumpeted a rambunctious third-quarter performance in China while Alliance Boots – which is unlisted – reiterated plans to acquire a stake in a regional pharmaceuticals distributor. Expanding into China has long-term logic. But it is a weak reason for confidence in these businesses shorter term.Bulls claim that the omnipotent Communist party will steer China clear of trouble. But Lombard dimly seems to recall that control economies have not always lived up to their name. It is optimistic to imagine that China is any more likely to prop up UK share prices than it is to prop up the euro.jonathan.guthrie@ft.comTate & Lyle: alison.smith@ft.com
143;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Alliance Boots’ sales weakest in four years;;Alliance Boots reported the weakest sales growth from its health and beauty division since it was taken private four years ago, as cash-strapped consumers reined in spending.The retailer and pharmaceutical wholesaler said sales at its health and beauty division rose 0.4 per cent to £3.65bn in the six months to September 30 from the year earlier period, the weakest since it was taken private in a £12.4bn deal in 2007.George Fairweather, finance director, said the performance had been affected by cautious consumers, and governments cutting healthcare budgets.“We are pleased with our performance relative to the high street, but it’s clear that it’s a tough UK environment, particularly outside of London and the south,” he said. “People on lower incomes, which is what we tend to see outside [of these areas] are under more pressure.”Sales from Boots UK stores open at least a year rose 0.7 per cent including value added tax.Mr Fairweather said that excluding VAT, the like-for-like performance would have been negative.He added that customers were spending on over-the-counter medicines when they were unwell, and were also still prepared to treat themselves in beauty, but they were focused on value.“We are seeing people more sensitive to offers, £1 toiletries deals are proving very popular,” he said.The comments follow those of Lord Wolfson, chief executive of Next, who said he believed consumer confidence had weakened, and he was not expecting to see an improvement at Christmas.Mr Fairweather said: “Christmas will be Christmas. At this stage, really all I can say is . . . we are well-positioned and we have a great offer.”The pharmaceutical wholesale division – which distributes drugs to pharmacies in 21 countries – increased sales by almost 50 per cent to £8.8bn, driven by deals last year to take control of Hedef Alliance and Anzag, pharmaceutical wholesalers in Turkey and Germany.Excluding these acquisitions, like-for-like sales on a constant currency basis rose by 2.7 per cent in the half year. Total group sales from continuing operations, rose 31.3 per cent year-on-year to £11.74bn.Alliance Boots, which was taken private by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Alliance Boots executive chairman Stefano Pessina also said it was in talks to take a stake in Nanjing Pharmaceutical Company, one of the leading pharmaceutical wholesalers in China.Mr Fairweather said Alliance Boots was under no pressure to refinance its debt, which matures between 2014 and 2017. Net borrowings stood at £7.8bn at the end of March.Mr Fairweather said the group was benefiting from low interest rates which helped free cash flow reach about £500m a year before any significant acquisitions.He also said there were no plans to float at present. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Ornella Barra, chief executive of the pharmaceutical wholesale division, said now was not the right time to return to the market and there was no urgency for an initial public offering.
144;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-11-01T18:42:24Z;G4S’s U-turn puts spotlight on risk aversion;;G4S’s spectacular forced U-turn on ISS has shone a spotlight on how averse shareholders are to risk, despite the often large cash piles that companies are hoarding.One veteran dealmaker said the collapse of this deal, the ousting of the Hewlett-Packard chief executive after its bid for Autonomy, and last year’s failed bid for AIA by the UK’s Prudential, all demonstrated how institutional investors were becoming more vocal.Bankers warned other potential acquirers to ensure that they had the support of shareholders before launching any takeovers.There had been initial indications of support for the G4S-ISS deal, with £1.6bn ($2.6bn) having been raised in sub-underwriting the planned £2bn rights issue.Dominic Rossi, global chief investment officer at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said the failure of the deal more broadly said “a lot about how scarce capital is at the moment and that the capacity to pull off this type of deal is very limited”.A survey by Fidelity analysts found that most companies were focusing little on M&A activity as a means to growth in the next two years.Companies were “holding their breath” out of concern over the sustainability of sales volumes in a deteriorating macro environment. “This issue trumps other factors such as inflation and companies’ financing position.”Their unwillingness to do deals is exacerbating the private equity sector’s pressing problem of how to offload some of the huge companies they bought in the run-up to the financial crisis.On both sides of the Atlantic, there are still many unsold large companies in private equity groups’ portfolios – be it Alliance Boots and United Biscuits in the UK or Toys ‘R’ Us in the US.Private equity groups worldwide own a record inventory of more than 6,000 unsold investments, according to recent estimates by Triago, a fund advisory group.With credit markets frozen in Europe and stock markets closed for new listings, buy-out executives said a sale to a corporate buyer was often the only alternative for some of the larger deals.The approach by G4S this July thus marked a more than welcome opportunity for ISS’s owners, particularly after they had twice failed to sell the company in the past 12 months.EQT Partners, the Swedish private equity group part-owned by the Wallenberg family, and GS Capital Partners, the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs, are now prepared to hold on to the company for a few years before an eventual stock market listing.Insiders said this would exceed EQT’s average holding period of five years.

Yet, bumping into her before our meeting, she is off-guard, checking her make-up in the mirror in the tiny ladies’ cloakroom in Alliance Boots’s corporate office in London.Her appearance is immaculate. All long blonde hair – her fringe flicked to the side to frame her face – expertly made-up eyes and glossy coppery red lips widening into a smile. Tall, even in flat shoes, her slim frame is swathed in a tailored black-and-white pinstriped suit and finished off with an emerald green silk scarf.This relaxed stance continues in a more formal boardroom, where Ms Barra, in a one-to-one setting, smiles freely and laughs easily and often.The 57-year-old trained pharmacist is chief executive of Alliance Boots’s pharmaceutical wholesale division, which supplies drugs to pharmacists in 21 countries and had a turnover of almost £14bn in the year to March. She is also in charge of Alliance Boots’s retail operations outside the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and leads its corporate social responsibility activities. She is in effect one of two joint managing directors of the £20bn turnover group.She has also been the partner of Stefano Pessina, Alliance Boots’s 70-year-old executive chairman and part-owner of the private group, for the past 25 years, although the couple have never married.“It’s more than one marriage,” she says in her thick Italian accent, of their professional and private partnership.Ms Barra was born in Chiavari, near Genoa in Italy, where her father, an entrepreneur, was in construction. Her mother played an integral part in the business, looking after the paperwork, company finances and staff. “My mother 50 years ago was a very strong lady, and followed my father in all activities, and maybe the DNA [was passed on to me],” she says.Ms Barra was keen to pursue a medical career. But she opted instead to study pharmacy at the University of Genoa because she thought that, as a woman, 35 years ago, it would be easier to reach a top position in pharmacy than in medicine.After graduation, she started work in a local pharmacy, but soon opened her own outlet close to Chiavari. Then she spotted a gap in the market – the wholesale supply of drugs to pharmacies.Two years after setting up the wholesale business, she sought a corporate partner to help develop the company.“I asked my friend to suggest a strong entrepreneur to move in the same direction and to develop the wholesaling activity in Italy together, and my friend suggested Stefano,” she says. “The rest is history.”She dodges the question of whether it was love at first sight, or the romance took time to kindle, choosing instead to focus on the corporate courtship.“During the meeting, I presented my programme and my vision to develop the business. Stefano had a company in the south of Italy, and myself in the north of Italy. I presented to Stefano my strategy . . . and Stefano was enthusiastic,” she says.Although the first few years were tough, they persevered, forging into all regions of Italy before creating the international company Alliance Santé, after a series of deals in France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Morocco.“In reality, Stefano represented the architect, the strategy of the company, and myself, the engine,” she says.In 1997, Alliance Santé merged with UniChem to create Alliance UniChem. Nine years later, Alliance UniChem sealed a deal with Boots, one of Britain’s best known high-street chains. In 2007, Mr Pessina and private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts took Alliance Boots private in a £12.4bn deal. The acquisition, at the height of the financial boom, was at the time Europe’s biggest buy-out.●Born: December 20 1953, Chiavari, Italy

In the company, Stefano is executive chairman and I report to him,” she says. “For us now it is normal.”Despite being regularly named on lists of the world’s most successful businesswomen, Ms Barra has until now largely stayed out of the limelight, leaving Mr Pessina to take the glory. “My style is low profile,” she says.Part of her reluctance to take a more public profile may be explained by her English, which can sometimes be difficult to follow. She occasionally has to confer with a colleague in Italian or French on an English word or phrase. “It is true,” she acknowledges. “In reality, English is my fourth language” – after Italian, French and Spanish. She also understands Portuguese and German.People who know Ms Barra say she is extremely driven and focused.“She’s a tough cookie,” says one person who has worked with her. “She is ruthless, determined and extremely experienced.”Another says she is “a very determined lady”. But he adds: “She’s got maybe a cold exterior, but a warm heart underneath.”Ms Barra acknowledges that she drives herself and her staff hard. “I am very demanding, especially with myself, and sometimes I am demanding with my colleagues, but at the same time, I want to protect my people,” she says.Part of the drive comes from her fierce work ethic. “In reality, for me, work is part of my pleasure,” she says. “It’s my hobby.”Such dedication will be necessary. Alliance Boots is widely expected to seek a return to the stock market in the next few years – although Ms Barra insists there are currently no such plans. Meanwhile, the economic crisis in Europe is the worst that she has seen in her 30-year career. With governments keen to cut their borrowing burdens – potentially affecting how much they spend on healthcare – her management mantra of always being one step ahead will be more necessary than ever.However, the crisis could open doors, in the form of acquisitions if the target is right, in markets such as China and Latin America, but also in Europe. “The economic crisis also means good opportunities if a company is solid, if a company has a good financial performance,” she says.Ms Barra may be prepared to reveal her softer edges. But anyone who thinks she has abandoned her steely side would be sorely mistaken."
146;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-10-30T19:30:45Z;Alliance Boots extends skincare deal;;"Alliance Boots has extended a European skincare deal with Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest consumer goods company by sales, from Italy to four more countries.Just over a year ago, the two companies entered into an unusual tie-up to develop Alliance Boots’s nascent skincare business in Europe.Under the terms of the trial, P&G agreed to support the launch of Alliance Boots’s Laboratories Serum 7 skincare range in Italian pharmacy chains. Alliance Boots developed and manufactured the products, while P&G was responsible for marketing and distribution. The two companies extended the partnership to Spain in March, and have now expanded it to Germany, Austria and Switzerland.Ornella Barra, chief executive of Alliance Boots’s pharmaceutical wholesale division, said the pilot had been so successful after a year that the two companies had decided to extend the collaboration to several other countries.“After a year, the test was excellent,” said Ms Barra.Stefano Pessina, Alliance Boots’s executive chairman and co-owner alongside Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, has made no secret of his desire to develop a “third leg” to the business. With £7.6bn retail business and a £14bn pharmaceutical wholesale arm, Mr Pessina’s final piece of the triumvirate is to elevate Alliance Boots’s brands – its Laboratories skincare range, Soltan suncare and Botanics beauty products – into a substantial business of their own.The deal comes as Ms Barra told the Financial Times that the crisis in Europe was the worst she had seen in her 30-year career.However, she said there could be opportunities for Alliance Boots to make acquisitions with China, Latin America but also Europe.“Of course, it is important to select the correct opportunity, and select a good country, but why not [take] the opportunity to grow again?” she said.She said Alliance Boots, which was expected to update this week on its first half trading, was continuing to perform well despite the conditions.“Despite the very tough environment, despite the economic crisis, the company continues to perform well,” she said.Alliance Boots was taken private four years ago by Mr Pessina and KKR in a £12.4bn deal.However, Ms Barra said there were no plans to list.“It is not the priority,"" she said. “It is not urgent to come back on the stock exchange. It is important to wait for the right time and to wait for a good moment to come back.”"
147;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-10-21T12:20:38Z;Tech founder seeks Nottingham hub;Bid to make town cluster for digital start-ups;"A successful Nottingham-based technology business founder has launched a campaign to make his home town the latest UK cluster for ambitious digital start-ups in the mould of Cambridge or London’s Silicon Roundabout.Adam Bird, who moved to the city from Hampshire to study at the university and “forgot to leave”, is the founder of Esendex, an SMS texting service with over 6,000 business customers, including Ocado, Virgin Media and EasyJet.Two years ago, he started Nottingham’s first networking club for software engineers, called Nott Tuesday, after realising that the only people he knew like this in the city were his own employees.He has since helped create another group for founders of technology start-ups and a monthly meeting where software programmers can write code together.Together, these groups bring together more than 100 people every week, and Bird hopes to build on this by promoting Nottingham as a place to found businesses.“What I am trying to do is to convince people that you don’t have to go to the bright lights of London; you can have a fantastic life and rewarding career in Nottingham,” he said.Although he says that Nottingham will never be able to command the scale of start-up activity that goes on in London or Cambridge, he believes it has many advantages as a small vibrant city with its own creative culture, close to the rural beauty of the Peak District.Nottingham was once home to some of the UK’s most iconic brands, which were vibrant start-ups in their time, such as Boots and Raleigh Bikes. However, the city council’s focus in recent years has been on attracting call-centres, such as those operated by Capital One and Specsavers.Nottingham has created some start-ups in recent years, set up by people who have moved to the city for work. These include TDX Group, a supplier of debt collection systems, and HD Decisions, which develops technology for the financial services industry.Esendex, which last year turned over £8.5m, employs 34 people in Nottingham as well as six in Barcelona and three in Melbourne. A third of its revenue is generated overseas.“The beauty of the internet is that you can set up a business like this anywhere,” Bird said. “What I would like is for people to do it in Nottingham.”"
148;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-10-13T12:57:49Z;Investing without borders;Global volatility can work to your advantage;In a world dominated by multinationals, individuals are expanding their investment horizons and moving away from local equity markets. But the rewards of cross-border investing are not without risks, warn experts.When it launched in 1994, the FTSE 100 index was a roll-call of British “blue-chip” household names, from Boots and British Home Stores to P&O, Trusthouse Forte and United Biscuits. But of the original 100 companies, only 30 remain in the index today, with the likes of international mining companies BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Xstrata in the top 20 largest FTSE-listed stocks, ahead of Tesco and many of the high-street banks.● Where next in the new world order?● Frontier lands attract fund managers● Opportunities remain in emerging market funds● Seeking growth close to homeThe internationalisation of the UK stock market is not merely a British phenomenon. Many of the largest exchanges worldwide are now home to a host of foreign companies, from China Mobile in New York to Prada in Hong Kong.Ten years ago, the majority of people in the UK would not have held any emerging market equities in their portfolios, says Patrick Connolly of AWD Chase de Vere, the financial advisers. “Now, they might have up to about 20 per cent of their holdings in this sector.”He says the attraction of cross-border investing is that clients’ money is not at ransom to the economic or market vagaries of one particular geographical area. For example, UK blue-chip stocks this year have taken less of a hit than some emerging markets companies.Experts warn, however, that there are downsides to owning non-UK equities. With any overseas investment, currency risk is a concern. Gains made on a US stock could be eaten up by currency conversion, regardless of the performance of the underlying shares.However, Sheridan Admans, investment adviser at The Share Centre, says a good fund manager can play this volatility to their advantage. “Currency obviously plays a role when buying overseas stocks, but it can be a benefit as well as a risk. If currency movements go your way, it can give you a return even when the underlying judgment is wrong.”These kind of risks can be hedged relatively inexpensively using tools such as covered warrants, but this does add a further degree of complexity to the process that some investors may feel less comfortable with. Some providers, such as RBS and SocGen, offer products called Quantos, which are used by investors to try to remove currency risk on non-UK underlying assets.Another thing to be aware of with cross-border investing is the tax implication of unpaid dividends on foreign shares, as many countries impose a withholding tax before dividends are paid to overseas shareholders.It is up to investors themselves to ensure they pay the correct amount of tax but research from Taxback.com an international tax specialist, reveals that just 7 per cent of all withholding tax on company dividends is currently reclaimed globally. It is possible to get around this by investing in funds, where the manager reclaims the tax on behalf of the investors, rather than individual shares.Despite the risks, however, Justin Modray at candidmoney.com, the advice site, says overseas investments are well worth considering for long-term growth. “Just ensure you understand what you’re buying and try to avoid excessive risk by making sure you are not overexposed to particular currencies,” he advises.
149;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-09-30T21:42:51Z;Man United to ramp up fan base gains;;The money Manchester United can make from exploiting its fan base will “dwarf” the income it has been acquiring from sponsorship deals, Richard Arnold, the Premier League champions’ commercial director predicted.While the Glazer family, which bought the club in 2005, ponders when to advance their $1bn Singapore flotation plans, the club’s executives are working on the next phase of the owners’ long-term goal of maximising income from its fame.The economic climate is forcing the Glazers to delay a planned initial public offering of about a third of the club’s equity on the Singapore stock exchange. But, as and when it does go to market, United’s commercial potential is bound to be a key part of its sales pitch.Officials have in recent weeks closed the latest of several deals with credit card companies that will enable United to earn income directly from their fans around the world. The club makes money when the Manchester United branded cards are first activated, during their general use and whenever the user incurrs charges.Up until now, United has expanded its commercial income from high-profile deals such as the £80m shirt sponsorship with US insurance group Aon, and the £40m training kit deal with logistics company DHL. United last season earned £103.4m in commercial revenues, up 27 per cent on the previous season.But Mr Arnold said the club had not yet taken its fanbase “and put that into a money-making machine”.The club’s customer database stands at 11m, he revealed, giving it a quantity of data and knowledge “about the same as a Boots or Tesco’s loyalty card”.But United has “a very high level of confidence” that the database will continue to grow at an “exponential” rate, and the potential income from direct monetisation of the fan base, such as United-branded credit cards in the Far East, was huge.“Adding these pieces together, it makes what we do now look like small fry…Even on some of the sponsorship activities and merchandising activities and the licensing activity, our opportunity in the future dwarfs the work that we’re doing currently.”However, the Manchester United Supporters Trust, the Glazers’ most strident critics, questioned whether the owners really understood the club’s fans. “The problem with their ownership model is the fans don’t feel a sense of ownership,” says Duncan Drasdo of MUST. “They feel a sense of exploitation.”Trying to persuade the fan base to spend money has proved “an impossible nut to crack”, he added.Mr Arnold acknowledged that cracking the Chinese market – “a hugely important piece of the puzzle in our commercial success” – was complicated and time-consuming.The club’s commercial strategy was shifting away from doing global deals with single brands to the more exhaustive task of multiple deals in individual countries. “Have we got the strategies sorted? No, but we’re erecting some phenomenal building-blocks for each and every one of these markets,” he said.In contrast to United’s manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, who earlier this week complained about the dominance of TV over football clubs, Mr Arnold had nothing but admiration for the way the Premier League and television had turned clubs such as United into “global property”.United’s matches were ubiquitious pieces of TV content, he said, speaking before Sir Alex’s comments were made public. “There’s nothing else in the world that is shown at least two hours a week on 80 per cent of the world’s televisions. There isn’t.”
150;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-09-26T16:06:08Z;Costing the Dream: SnoozeShade;;Cara Sayer invented SnoozeShade, a blackout blind for prams and strollers, out of desperation.Early in her pregnancy, at the age of 39, Sayer was diagnosed with symphysis pubis dysfunction (SPD) – a painful condition which confined her to a wheelchair. Sayer recovered when her daughter Holly, now three, was three months old.“I was desperate to get out of the house and I would go out as much as I could with Holly,” Sayer says. “The problem was that she would not sleep, as she was too distracted by light and movement.”Sayer tried putting coats and blankets over Holly’s pram but they fell off and were too hot during the summer. Sunshades did not work because they did not make the pram dark enough and were too bulky.She found herself dealing with a grizzly baby who would not feed or sleep at night. However, Sayer felt she was not alone. “My friends had the same problem but there was nothing on the market we could buy,” she says. A business opportunity beckoned.Sayer, who previously worked in advertising and marketing, decided to invent her own product. She did research through online mothers’ forums and among friends, and received a lot of positive feedback.In February 2009, she completed the design and a former work colleague put her in touch with Giftpoint, a UK-based manufacturer with factories in China, whose output included baby products.The factory made some samples but Sayer was then hit by postnatal depression and dropped the idea for a few months. “It was my mum who encouraged me to have a go,” she says. “Without her, I probably would not have gone for it.”A SnoozeShade website was created and, in October, Sayer and her mother, Mary, took her original prototype shade to a baby and child trade show at the Excel Centre in London’s Docklands.“The prototype was hand-stitched and falling apart and our stand looked very amateurish compared to the others,” Sayer recalls. “But I got a lot of interest and we took an order for 100 shades for a February delivery. I said yes even though I did not have a product. Then I rang Giftpoint in a panic and said, ‘Oh my God, can we do this?’”Assured that she could, Sayer then devised her business model: pre-order stock and sell to retailers, then use the website to sell direct to consumers.“There are 750,000 babies born each year in the UK, so I decided to go for 1 per cent of that market and I ordered 10,000 shades to start with,” she said.Sayer had £40,000 of savings as seed funding. Almost two years later, she has yet to spend £10,000 of this – having saved money by working from home and securing favourable terms with her supplier that enabled her to pay for the products from her sales proceeds.She priced SnoozeShade at £19.99, based on her product costs and on retailers’ and distributors’ margins of 50 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively.Sayer then cold-called retailers and got lucky. By early 2010, SnoozeShades were in 40 outlets, including Mothercare, the leading children’s products retailer, and John Lewis, Middle England’s favourite department store. But as sales escalated, so did the pressures of juggling family and business life. Sayer had become what is now called a ‘mumtrepreneur’.“I had never seen myself as a stay-at-home mum, so I was keen to start my own business,” she says. “But, despite my being a well-organised person as a rule, time management has been my biggest problem.”Sayer admits that she should have used more childcare in the early days but says that she was put off by the cost and the “guilt factor”. She was lucky, however, that her mother lent a hand and her husband, a banker, sometimes worked from home.“It was still a nightmare trying to juggle it all,” Sayer recalls. “I’d work through the night then, exhausted, ring my mum up at 7am asking if she could look after Holly.”On top of this, the Sayers wanted another child and, between November 2009 and April 2010, had the added stress of IVF treatment – which was unsuccessful. The pressures came to a head when, in the summer of 2010, Sayer collapsed from exhaustion.“I was like a vegetable. Mum moved in for three months to look after me and Holly and to save the business.”She recovered and says she is now copes better. “Holly is now in full-time nursery and, when I attend trade shows abroad Mum comes with me, so childminders, Luc and friends help out with Holly.’Sayer also modified her business model, bringing in a UK distributor who got the SnoozeShade into more large UK retailers, including Tesco, Asda and Boots. She found overseas distributors and outsourced key tasks such as legal work, bookkeeping, printing and design, which also kept costs down.“It took some of the pressure off, so I could concentrate on expanding the business,” Sayer says. However, survival depends upon constantly evolving the product line, Sayer admits. “I cannot really protect the product [by patents]. I need to create a worldwide brand so people buy my products because of my name.” Social media – she has 3,000 Twitter followers and lots of feedback on her company website – have been “invaluable” in developing the product line, Sayer says.So far, the numbers do not prove conclusively whether SnoozeShade will enable Sayer to achieve her dream, and it has been a difficult journey – personally, as well as entrepreneurially.In its first year, SnoozeShade made a small profit but the business recorded a loss in the first six months of 2011. However, SnoozeShade has won a clutch of national awards and Sayer is one of three European finalists in the international Cartier Women’s Initiative awards.SnoozeShade is now sold in more than 20 countries. But, for Sayer, the main risk is a rival product stealing her market. She says her strength lies in developing a brand name that was first to market. Favourable payment terms agreed with her supplier have also helped cash flow.Sayer admits she is still “firefighting” a lot of the time. However, with a strong network of family, friends and childcarers, she is learning to cope with joining the growing band of ‘mumtrepreneurs’.
151;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-09-20T15:46:42Z;Poundland to open six stores in Ireland;Dublin tackles a large budget deficit;With Ireland’s economy on its knees, this might not appear to be the best moment to open a retail chain. But Poundland, which was born out of the 1990s recession in the UK, believes the conditions are ripe for its particular offering.Poundland is to brand itself as Dealz, avoiding the use of the word “euro,” which its research suggests has a negative connotation for many Irish consumers due to the ongoing eurozone debt crisis.Jim McCarthy, chief executive of the discount retailer, is diplomatic in his choice of words, describing the Irish market as “incredibly challenged.”But in an interview with the Financial Times, he says Poundland’s research suggests “there has been a flight to value as households seek to preserve their lifestyles”.Many Irish families are weighed down by mortgage and other debt, taxes are on the rise as the Dublin government tackles a large budget deficit, and savings have reached record levels as people fret about the future.Against this backdrop, Poundland, owned by private equity group Warburg Pincus, plans to open 6 stores this year in a £2m investment, forming 180 jobs.This will be its first venture outside the UK, and will – it is hoped – provide a platform to target continental European markets.The discounter, which is based in Willenhall in the West Midlands, sells more than 3,000 items in its 347 UK stores – anything from a pregnancy test to reading glasses and a bottle of bleach, each item for only a £1.By not using “euro” in its name in its Irish stores, analysts say the company will have more flexibility about pricing strategy.Sean Murphy, deputy chief executive of Chambers Ireland, an umbrella group for the country’s chambers of commerce, says Poundland’s arrival will help restart consumer activity. But on Dublin’s O’Connell Street, shoppers are more sceptical. “What it really says is we’re all broke,” says one woman.Ann Fitzgerald, chief executive of the National Consumer Agency, says: “During the boom, convenience was the number one priority. Now it’s price.”Since her agency started to publish price surveys, consumers have been encouraged to shop around. But according to figures last week from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) Irish consumers are still paying almost 20 per cent more than the European average for goods and services, despite a fall in inflation.Consumer prices fell in 2010 but remained high by EU standards. Ireland was the fifth most expensive EU state in 2010, after Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden, with prices 18 per cent above the EU average.However, this represents a considerable improvement on 2009 when Irish prices were 26 per cent above the EU average and second only to Denmark.Back in the 1980s Tesco briefly had a retail presence in Ireland, but pulled out in 1986. Industry analysts say Irish shoppers were very brand conscious at that time and found it hard to switch to Tesco’s own label products, even if cheaper.With the Northern Ireland peace process in the late 1990s and then the credit and property boom in the Irish economy, Ireland became spoilt for choice with an invasion of UK high street brands.Tesco returned to the Irish market, buying Quinnsworth in 1997, which although it was owned by Associated British Foods was seen as an Irish brand. Boots bought the Hayes Cunningham Robinson chain of pharmacies. Debenhams acquired the family owned Roches stores company in 2006.Grafton Street, Dublin’s most famous shopping street, still boasts more than 15 UK retailers, according to British trade officials, but it is tough going. Retail sales continue to fall, and many companies remain locked into expensive rental agreements by Ireland’s upwards-only rental regime.But the change in consumer sentiment is best reflected by the success of German hard discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have each established strong followings. Aldi increased sales in the three months to end of July by 26 per cent, and is now bigger than Superquinn, a local chain bought out of receivership this summer by the Musgrave group of Cork.Poundland believes it too can win over the value-conscious Irish consumer – what Mr McCarthy calls the savvy Irish shopper.Poundland’s experience in the UK is that it flourished not only in poorer working class districts but also in well-heeled neighbourhoods. Mr McCarthy says the AB demographic – or upper middle class – accounts for 13 per cent of Poundland’s customers in its UK stores, and he expects a similar pattern in Ireland.“Our experience in the UK is [that] people are being more careful with their money, less wasteful since the last recession,” says Mr McCarthy. “There is a new paradigm in behaviour.”
152;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-09-02T19:45:51Z;Retailers tap software for store refits;;"Deciding exactly which upgrades make commercial sense during a store refit is not easy, but now some retailers including Boots, the UK-based high street chemist, are turning to so-called evidence-based decision-making software to improve the process and reduce the risk of making a mistake.‘Test & Learn’, a suite of software tools developed by US-based Applied Predictive Technologies, is designed to help retailers and others reduce the risks of any new initiative by systematically testing the idea with a subset of stores, customers or employees. Based on the results of these tests, retailers can then decide whether, how and where to roll out the changes.The software, which is typically coupled with APT’s consulting services, enables retailers to test proposed new initiatives in a limited number of retail locations, learn from the results and accurately predict the impact of decisions before implementing them throughout the store network.APT claims that by using Test & Learn, external factors including competition, region, store layout, demographics and the economy can be discounted, revealing the true incremental value of a new initiative. To back its claims, the company points to the experiences of the 50 retailers and other companies that have licensed and use its software. Aside from Boots, they include Subway, Staples, Lowe’s, Victoria’s Secret and Chico’s, the US clothing retailer.Boots, which had learnt about the success of APT’s software in the US retail market, was seeking a more accurate understanding of how the decisions it makes on merchandising, layout and product range would benefit its customers.The company’s challenge to APT was whether the software could be used to draw increased insights into its store refurbishment plans and trials, which could then be used to inform investment decisions and improve its customer offering.“We were looking for a greater depth and clarity to our data and our testing in order to make the best possible decisions and meet the needs of existing customers while also attracting new ones,” says Stephen Haynes, head of trials management at Boots. “We needed accurate and detailed results from all of our store trials in order to optimise subsequent merchandising, space, marketing and capital investment decisions.”Boots wanted the software to help answer three key questions about a store refurbishment programme it was contemplating before moving forward with a broad-based rollout. The company wanted to know: What impact will the programme have on specific revenue streams?; will the programme have a bigger impact in some regions than others?; and finally, could elements of the idea be modified for greater impact?“From the outset, we were impressed with APT and excited by the possibilities the software was offering,” Haynes says. APT worked with Boots to design and set up the trials.“Even deciding how many stores to trial in requires scientific calculation. Too many stores could prove too costly – too few and the results would be inconclusive,” he says.Using the software during a nine-month trial, he says Boots was able to analyse the data to produce accurate demographic statistics, information about which elements of the store refits were most productive and how quickly Boots, which operates nearly 2,500 stores across the UK, could expect to recoup its initial investment.“We have been extremely satisfied with the results Test & Learn provided from our in-store trials, which determined our longer term investment decisions,” Mr Haynes said.Boots has now licensed the software for a further five years and is conducting or planning to conduct a number of trials using the software. “Test & Learn is the world’s only software to provide scientific evaluation of trials taking place in large consumer focused organisations,“ says Jim Manzi, APT’s executive chairman and managing director.“In retail today, it is essential that decisions are made based on the best information available to ensure success. APT is able to help its clients in the retail sector to focus on profitable delivery whilst also enabling them to provide a more tailored customer offering.”"
153;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Exit draws parallels with Fresh & Easy foray;;The latest in a long line of Western businesses to check out of the Japanese market, Tesco’s decision to sell up draws uncomfortable parallels with its other famously lossmaking foreign outpost – its Fresh & Easy chain in the US.There are clear comparisons – the Japanese and US businesses both revolve around smaller-format supermarkets which require large numbers of outlets to be profitable. However, analysts believe the loss of its Japanese business is “immaterial” to Tesco’s global business ambitions, with some expressing surprise that it has taken management eight years to work this out.“Frankly, Sir Terry Leahy should have bitten the bullet years ago,” says Kate Calvert, retail analyst at Seymour Pierce. “This is one of the first strategic decisions for Philip Clarke, but it’s not a sign of his strategic intent in the US.”Since Mr Clarke took over as chief executive from Sir Terry Leahy in March, the future of Fresh & Easy has never strayed far from the centre of attention. Tesco entered the US market in 2004, and analysts estimate chasing a slice of the US grocery market has put it on course to rack up accumulated losses of over £700m by the end of its current financial year. However, Mr Clarke has underlined his commitment to turn around the business, opening new stores, overhauling existing ones and trialling a version of its Clubcard loyalty scheme in a bid to break even in the US by the end of the 2012-13 financial year.Mr Clarke, who was Tesco’s international director before landing the top job, would have been well aware of Japan’s weakness compared to other world markets. “Japan is a market of 110m people, so to have a meaningful presence Tesco would have needed more than 129 minuscule stores,” says Clive Black, retail analyst at Shore Capital, concluding that growth prospects in Thailand and Korea – not to mention China – are the better Asian bet. Last year, Tesco’s Asian business grew by over 20 per cent reporting revenues of over £10bn.To put the small size of its Japanese business in context, Tesco’s market share in the greater Tokyo area is less than half a percentage point. An intensively competitive market, Western names who have tried and failed to gain a foothold in Japan include Carrefour and Boots. Having already written off £186m on a business it acquired for £139m back in 2003, the writing has been on the wall for some time. Analysts estimate the Japanese business made a loss of around £20m last year, which seems small in comparison to £186m of losses generated in the US, where investment is still pouring in.Fresh & Easy is on track to have 225 stores trading by next Spring, and following recent progress in its trading performance, the market is not expecting Mr Clarke to announce a withdrawal from the US market any time soon. “Deciding to quit Japan does show that Phil Clarke is prepared to make tough choices, and it’s notable that he’s given so much support and attention to the US business,” adds Mr Black. “That was the carrot – and the stick is if there isn’t a clear trajectory towards profitability going forwards then another tough decision will be made.”Turning back to Asia, a more distant prospect is the expansion possibilities in China over the coming decades. “Really, the long-term question is can Tesco afford to invest in the expansion of China and the US at the same time,” adds Ms Calvert. “Ultimately, it may need to sell one off to concentrate on the other.”
154;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-08-14T13:58:45Z;Debt market woes lead to buy-out chill;Slowdown in high-yield market hits liquidity;A few months ago, private equity managers looked set to be heading back towards the dealmaking frenzy of 2007, when highly leveraged mega buy-outs worth more than $10bn almost seemed to be daily business.While deal sizes and volumes in the first half of this year remained a far cry from 2007 levels, debt markets had become almost as aggressive as four years ago – culminating this summer in the €2.3bn buy-out of Securitas Direct, with sky-high debt levels at seven times the Swedish alarm maker’s earnings.But after recent market jitters, the music in the buy-out industry has yet again stopped – and the prospects for it to recommence after the August summer lull look bleak.“Things are quiet … and we would not be surprised if that would carry on,” says Lynn Fordham, chief executive at SVG Capital, the listed investor in UK buy-out fund Permira.“The number of deals we’ve been asked to underwrite has dropped off a cliff,” said a senior banker. “I’m seeing a lack of product coming through.”The first half mini-repetition of the buy-out binge of 2006 and 2007 was driven by a buoyant high-yield bond market, which helped finance a rash of debt maturity extensions of private equity-owned companies.This wave of refinancings and several large disposals to cash-rich strategic buyers – such as the $13.7bn sale of Swiss pharmaceutical group Nycomed to Japanese rival Takeda – funnelled back a lot of money to holders of the initial leveraged loans, mostly specialised investors called collateral loan obligations.They in turn reinvested the money, which became the main driver for the string of highly leveraged deals in the buy-out market.But the high-yield market has come unstuck in recent weeks, and the wave of re-financings that triggered a recycling of CLO money has been brought to a halt.What is more, the debt market jitters could leave many banks stuck with unsellable bridge loans – such as the one for the buy-out of Securitas Direct by Bain Capital and Hellman & Friedman – on their balance sheets, reducing their appetite to hand out further debt to private equity groups.“Whatever way you cut it, it is seven times leveraged, and the market will not take that now,” said a big CLO manager.These renewed debt market woes come at exactly the wrong time for buy-out managers, as they still have an estimated $400bn pile of unspent cash to deploy.“I am not optimistic,” another senior banker says. “September and October will be dominated by the hung deals and few if any new transactions will get done.”It also comes as the pressure is on private equity groups to sell or bring public some of the often highly-leveraged deals they have made during the industry’s heyday up to 2007.On both sides of the Atlantic, there are still many unsold large companies in private equity groups’ portfolios – be it Alliance Boots in the UK or Toys “R” Us in the US.The sector owns a record inventory of more than 6,000 unsold investments worldwide, the bulk of which is concentrated in the troubled 2005-08 credit bubble buy-out fund vintages, according to estimates by Triago, a private equity fund advisory group.And even before debt markets started to freeze, the bustling activity had been a fraction of the levels seen during the industry’s heyday. The global buy-out volume of $96bn in the first half of this year was a mere fifth of that seen in the same period of 2007, data from Dealogic shows.The dearth of activity in the debt market is set to hit private equity groups’ returns, as they will have to stump up more equity and pay higher interest rates.“Deals will still get done but getting the financing in place will take longer and the maximum deal size will go down as well,” says William Allen, managing partner at Marlborough Partners, a financial advisory boutique.Some private equity groups have already seen their deal financing become more expensive.After struggling to syndicate a €500m loan for the buy-out of German retailer Jack Wolfskin by Blackstone, banks have inserted a €70m second lien loan tranche into the debt package with an interest rate of 9.5 per cent above interbank rate, people close to the situation said. That compares with just 5 per cent paid for the senior loan.Fotis Hasiotis, co-head of the European financial sponsor group at Lazard, says that in the end, recent jitters could create opportunities for private equity to snap up cheaper assets using more equity.“If this leads to a decrease in some of the valuation levels we have seen recently this could be viewed as a healthy correction,” he says.
155;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-08-09T13:41:43Z;Retailers must resist exodus from riot hot spots;;"There has been a simple rule of thumb for rioters’ attacks on shops. If goods are desirable and portable (shoes, clothes, electrical goods), they nick them. They may even pause to check that the stolen trainers fit. If stock is too heavy to carry (carpets, furniture), they torch the place.Such calculated criminality weakens interpretations of the riots as a cri de coeur from the inner city. But while disadvantage is no excuse for the unrest, it is one root cause. Businesses should resist the temptation to withdraw from neighbourhoods where rioters have attacked outlets of companies such as Carpetright, Dixons, JD Sports and Boots. The problem will otherwise worsen. Staying on to rebuild, as Carpetright founder Lord Harris plans to do, is a better test of social responsibility than attending conferences on that slippery subject. Retailers are bulwarks of economic normality within poor urban areas, both as places to shop and as employers. Take them away, and you penalise everyone, both the looter and his churchgoing auntie.But there are two sides to the bargain. Retailers with outlets in rough parts of town need support. Tax breaks are useful, and some are already on offer. Red-lining of problem districts by nervous insurers must be discouraged. And the police need to take crime against businesses much more seriously. There are obvious difficulties to stemming quicksilver riots organised by BlackBerry Messenger. But the police have a poor long-term record of investigating and deterring crimes against businesses.Their response to the current riots has been patchy. Arson and looting must not become a safety valve for violence under the banner of “sensitive” policing. The constabulary must arrest perpetrators, not stand to one side as some did on Monday night. That would forestall panicky calls to send in the army. Soldiers, as a US military man once remarked, are good at breaking things and killing people, not policing.The feud between BP and AAR, its Russian partner in the TNK-BP joint venture, resembles a particularly messy marriage breakdown. The husband accused of visiting a wine bar with that tart from the office is wont to counter that his wife had flirted outrageously with a local Lothario at the golf club dinner dance. Hence, according to AAR member Renova, BP plans to file for damages against it for allegedly breaching an exclusivity agreement through involvement with rival businesses. This is a riposte to a move by AAR to claim up to $10bn from BP for supposedly committing the same infraction via an abortive tie-in with Rosneft.Both legal actions can be seen as bargaining counters that can be tossed into the likely endgame: the dissolution of the TNK-BP partnership. That does not inevitably involve AAR selling out, as previously mooted. Russian shareholders would, it is said, be happy to hang on to their stake while welcoming a new partner. One might argue that BP badly needs the Russian hydrocarbons production that accounted for 28 per cent of the total in the first half of 2011. But with the shares on a lowly forward earnings ratio of 5.6 times, the value of the joint venture is not even factored into the price, according to one oil analyst. With the current earnings yield at over 16 per cent, the shares would represent a buy in normal market conditions.The FTSE dipped below 4,900 on Tuesday morning. That means we were fleetingly in a bear market, defined as a 20 per cent drop below the putative cyclical high reached just before the Japanese earthquake. Here is Lombard’s cut-out-and-keep identification guide to the grizzly phenomenon, lest it recur:
● The official start will be marked by predictions of massive City job losses. The financial services analyst that comes up with the highest figure wins the prize of being quoted most widely (as per Stephen Lewis in 1987).
● Doomsters who have predicted catastrophe for as long as anyone can remember will be credited with uncanny prescience (see fund manager Tony Dye in the early noughties).
● The trough will be signalled by becalmed equity syndication executives sounding out journalist acquaintances about job opportunities in the media. Yes, they may really get that desperate.

156;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-07-22T22:09:03Z;Coral plays a canny hand appointing Hornby;;Gala Coral played its cards close to its chest ahead of announcing the appointment of Andy Hornby as chief executive, a job he had already started by the time the bookmaker got round to releasing the news on Monday.The sensitivity is understandable, given Mr Hornby was at the helm of HBOS when it nearly collapsed in the credit crunch in 2008, prompting a merger that in turn debilitated bigger rival Lloyds. Nor has he exactly won over critics since, becoming chief executive of Alliance Boots in 2009, only to leave four months ago, citing stress.Now the 44-year-old Harvard Business School graduate is responsible for turning round the bookmaking arm of privately held gaming business Coral, reporting to group chief executive Carl Leaver. He fills a gap left by Nick Rust, who joined Ladbrokes last year to run its UK betting shops.Mr Hornby worked in retail early in his career, shining under Archie Norman at Asda, so he should have some ideas of how to improve Gala Coral’s 1,670 shops. But his first days on the job seem to have been devoted to the online offering, with the announcement on Wednesday of a 10-year contract with technology provider Playtech.The company rejected rumours that Mr Hornby planned to lead a management buy-out of Gala Coral from its parent, taken over by former creditors last year. Many industry-watchers expect some corporate activity, however, including the possible sale of the casino business.
157;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;IPOs hold the key to forging reputations;;"To misquote Benjamin Franklin, it takes many good flotations to build a good reputation and only one bad one to lose it.Dealmakers in the private equity industry should take note. Figures published this week by the Financial Times showed that almost $10bn of flotations were shelved in the first half of the year, the worst six-month period for scrapped listings in six years, according to Dealogic.In the second quarter, only one of 45 global private equity-backed initial public offerings took place in London, in spite of the UK’s position as Europe’s biggest market for buy-outs by some distance.This matters because buy-out bosses are plotting IPOs for a string of potential FTSE 100 companies in the coming months, including Alliance Boots, the UK pharmacy chain, and Acromas, the group formed by merging the AA and Saga.In continental Europe there have been a string of successful buy-out exits on public markets, including Kabel Deutschland, Germany’s biggest cable operator; TDC, the Danish telecom group; and Amadeus, the Spanish travel reservation company.But in Britain, trust has been eroded between the private equity sellers of companies and the fund managers being asked to invest in them.Private equity bosses argue their companies should be valued at a premium to their peers. Suspicious City investors say the lack of transparency and high debt of many private equity-owned companies merit a discount and often ask: “If they are selling, why should I buy?”.Private equity’s reputation in the UK has taken a further blow recently amid controversy over the financial meltdown at Southern Cross, Britain’s biggest care homes operator with 752 homes and 31,000 residents.Blackstone, the US buy-out group that made big profits from floating Southern Cross five years ago, has been widely blamed for the group’s woes, even though it sold out in 2007 and the shares kept rising for more than a year after that.Ironically, Southern Cross’s fate was sealed this week when a third of its care homes were taken over by its biggest landlord NHP. Blackstone spun off NHP in a deal that separated the care homes group from its properties and many observers blamed this for causing Southern Cross’s subsequent woes.This week saw another example of how hard it can be to rebuild a reputation, when bank shares fell sharply after the publication of European banking stress test results. These were designed to reassure markets about the robustness of Europe’s lenders. But, like the first set of stress tests last year, they did not test for an all-out sovereign default and so failed to convince investors they had been tough enough.The lesson for companies such as Blackstone, which bought the German outdoor clothing maker Jack Wolfskin this week for €700m and may one day want to float it, is to start rebuilding private equity’s reputation by learning from past mistakes."
158;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-07-18T22:06:44Z;Ex-chief of Alliance Boots joins Gala Coral;;Andy Hornby, the former chief executive of HBOS and Alliance Boots, has joined Gala Coral, taking on the task of reviving the bookmaking arm of the gambling company.Mr Hornby took up his role as chief executive on Monday, bringing to a close a protracted search for a post left vacant since last year when Nick Rust left to join Ladbrokes. He will be responsible for Coral’s 1,670 shops and its online and telephone betting business.Simon Clare of the privately held Gala Coral denied a report in the gambling website Egaming Review that Mr Hornby’s condition for joining was an agreement that he would in time be able to lead a management buy-out of Coral. The company has also reportedly been subjected to a number of inquiries for its Gala casino business.“There is no break-up of the group planned or on the horizon,” said Mr Clare. “Coral is the group’s largest business and deserves a CEO of his calibre. There is absolutely no plan or agreement.”Mr Hornby lasted less than two years at Alliance Boots, his resignation being announced in March when he declared he was taking a few months’ break after “an intense last five years”.He was associated with HBOS’s aggressive growth strategy, resigning from the bank after it was brought to the brink of collapse by the financial crisis, and before its rescue by Lloyds TSB. He could not be reached for comment.A former Asda executive, Mr Hornby will be reporting to Carl Leaver, the chief executive of Coral and former director at Marks and Spencer. Mr Leaver, who could not be reached for comment, has previously denied that he was looking for an exit from Coral.Mr Leaver was holding the reins at Coral and had been “spread too thin”, said Mr Clare. “He can get on with being the group’s CEO.”Another retail veteran, Robert Templeman, Debenhams’ ex-chief executive, is the group’s chairman.Coral is run by a consortium of its former creditors, including Park Square, Apollo Management, Cerberus and York Capital, who took control of the company from a trio of private equity companies last year in a year-long restructuring of the business and put up £200m to repay debt. Each shareholder has four board appointments.A £1.6bn ($2.6bn) refinancing was completed last month, giving the company a new long-term capital structure.
159;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
160;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-07-12T08:29:25Z;Greencore agrees £113m Uniq takeover;;"Uniq, the convenience food group that was put up for sale by its pension fund this year, is to be bought by Irish rival Greencore for £113m.Geoff Eaton, Uniq’s chief executive, described the 93p-a-share cash deal as an excellent outcome for the company’s pension scheme members and shareholders after six years of struggle to rescue the business, which had faced collapse under the burden of its pension deficit.A groundbreaking deficit-for-equity swap deal, approved by the Pension Regulator, cleared the way for Uniq’s pension scheme to take 90 per cent of the company’s equity to escape a pension deficit of about £430m. The pension scheme then put the business up for sale.Patrick Coveney, chief executive of Greencore, said the deal would generate synergies of more than £10m a year through supply chain and back-office savings.Alan Williams, Greencore’s finance director, described Uniq as a business that “came clean” from pension problems. The Irish company will fund the deal with a £70m rights issue and £53m of new banking facilities. Together, these will keep Greencore’s net debt below three times ebitda, Mr Williams said. Greencore’s net debt stands at just under €240m.Greencore produces 200m sandwiches a year in a UK market of 1.6bn units valued at about £3bn. It supplies Marks and Spencer, Asda, Wm Morrison, Waitrose, J Sainsbury, the Co-operative and Boots.The takeover of Uniq, which is expected to be completed by September, will add about 50 per cent to Greencore’s sandwich volumes.Greencore expects to absorb £10m in transaction costs in addition to the £113m price tag for Uniq and £3m assumed in net debt.The deal will see Greencore pull further ahead of the UK’s other leading sandwich makers: Samworth Brothers, which is understood to have considered a bid for Uniq; fast-growing Adelie which is owned by private equity group Duke Street; and Northern Foods which itself spurned an agreed takeover approach by Greencore last autumn, instead agreeing a sale for £342m to Ranjit Singh Boparan, a poultry processor, this year.Uniq’s shares rose 17¾p to 94¼p, while Greencore shares closed down 8.6 cents at €0.875."

A clutch of retailers gathered around the shrubbery as Charlie Mayfield of John Lewis and Ian Cheshire of Kingfisher were joined by John Browett, Dixons chief, while Sir Philip Green and Alliance Boots chairman Stefano Pessina also put in an appearance.For a Chelsea Flower Show slideshow go to: ft.com/chelseaflower…New bloomsIn among Chelsea’s hardy annuals were fresh faces Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive, andSteven Kalmin, finance director, of new FTSE 100 entrant Glencore.

162;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-05-20T22:12:58Z;Mobile phone pay system launches in UK;;The first mobile phone payment system has been launched in the UK.Shops and restaurants including Eat, Pret A Manger, McDonald’s and some Boots stores will be fitted with Barclaycard readers allowing customers with a specially adapted Orange handset to purchase small items by swiping their phones.Users will first have to load their phones with money from their accounts, in increments up to £100, and will then be able to use it to buy items up to a total purchase amount of £15.The machines will be available in about 50,000 stores across the country.Contactless mobile phone payment has been promoted as the future of payments by financial services companies for several years.O2 worked with Visa and Barclaycard in 2007 on a piloted scheme to let people use phones instead of Oyster cards on London transport systems.Barclays had previously predicted that by 2012 it would be normal to pay for items with a phone, and that five years later phones would overtake credit cards.But the lack of handsets featuring near field communication, the short-range wireless technology used for the payment systems, has prevented mobile wallets from becoming a mass market phenomenon. So far just one handset will be available with the system.Analysts say take-up of the new payment system in the UK, where consumers already use debit cards to make small payments, may be slow.Mobile phone payment is more popular overseas than in Britain. Japan has more than 30m consumers using a phone payment system called Mobile FeliCa.
163;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-05-16T11:33:41Z;Maple rags LSE with patriotic case for bid clearance;;Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel and the first refuge of the insecure. National feeling in Canada, a bilingual ex-colony with a superpower neighbour, is necessarily assertive under perceived threat. The flag-waving Maple Group bid approach for TMX accordingly has an impetus lacked by the London Stock Exchange’s agreed merger with the Canadian exchanges company.In conference calls on Monday Luc Bertrand of Maple was even able to inject nationalism into the case for antitrust watchdogs to pass the transaction. Under the Maple proposal, TMX’s main shareholders would include four big Canadian banks, controlling the Toronto and Montreal exchanges alongside the Alpha share trading platform and CDS, the country’s main clearing house. However, high volumes of Canadian share trading on US exchanges guarantee competition, he claimed. A tie-in between the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq was vetoed in the US for reasons related to listings that did not apply north of the border, Mr Bertrand added.All very well to respond by railing against Canadian protectionism. The LSE, as the proponent of a “merger of equals” with TMX, needs to win the bid battle rather than figure as a defeated advocate of free trade. Stockbroker Numis says efficiency savings would allow the LSE to go beyond the nil-premium all-share offer currently on the table. However, an explicit takeover would further unsettle Canadian patriots. And the LSE is financially outgunned by Maple, already offering a steep premium to the British group’s offer.In retrospect, LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet should have offered tetchy Canadians a better patriotic premium via the fine print of the merger. The merged board should perhaps have featured more TMX representatives. A commitment could also have been given for the anthem “O Canada!” to be sung (in English, French and aboriginal Inuktitut) at the start of trading every day in Paternoster Square.Now the LSE has little choice but to sit back and hope that Canada’s Competition Bureau spikes Maple’s guns. If that fails, it could always market itself as a synergistic purchase for Maple, or, with slightly greater hopes of success, Nasdaq. After all, consolidation is all about shareholder value, not national or executive ambition. Isn’t that right, Mr Rolet?Transparent motivesIt is sometimes difficult to remember that Alliance Boots is no longer a quoted business. It announced results with all the pomp of an FTSE 100 company. Festivities included a press conference at a posh hotel and a financial statement that eschewed the stark minimalism of those published by other private businesses.Executive chairman Stefano Pessina says that transparency fosters trust with customers. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity group that took Alliance Boots private in 2007, must be equally interested in keeping the group on the radar of potential stock market investors. Former and future shareholders are supposed to eye hungrily 11 per cent growth in earnings.A cynic would note that companies interested in floating produce predictably strong results. But the group still deserves credit for disproving Jeremiahs that predicted its UK high street healthcare chain would be destroyed by low-cost competition. Prescriptions drive a lot of footfall and robust margins if properly exploited.No flotation is imminent, though. KKR and Mr Pessina (a committed holder) bought Alliance Boots on an estimated price ratio of 24 times forward earnings. Battered general retailers are generally now valued at half that. Private equity firms prefer to signpost market peaks, not troughs, with their floats.Political hackGeorge Osborne has highlighted the threat that hacking poses at a Google event, revealing that the government receives more than 20,000 malicious e-mails a month. Lombard’s IT systems are also buffeted by regular cyber attacks such as: – a screen-freezing link to a video of a laughing baby, sent by a spambot masquerading as a bored colleague. – a malware assault against a home laptop concealed as a botched install of the game “Tigger’s Hunny Hunt”. – unsolicited offers of anti-impotence pills consistent with black propaganda intended to damage the recipient’s self-image.Who could be responsible? The Russian mafia? Or the North Korean military? A complacent IT user might attribute his woes to idlers, mischievous kids and a spam filter with more holes in it than a slice of Emmental. But a sinister explanation is much more exciting. So, like Mr Osborne, we will stick with that.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
164;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-05-16T10:23:38Z;Alliance Boots revenues push past £20bn;;An acquisitions spree at Alliance Boots, the international pharmaceuticals retailing group, has pushed full-year sales past £20bn ($32bn) but the company has been forced to defend media accusations that it has been “disingenuous” about how much UK tax it pays.The Swiss-domiciled company, headed by Stefano Pessina, executive chairman, was taken private four years ago in a £12.4bn deal with private equity house Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.On Monday, Mr Pessina reiterated that there were no plans for a European listing, despite the group achieving 15 per cent sales growth for the year to March 31, and pre-tax profits increasing from £460m to £637m.The group cut its net debt to £7.8bn, a reduction of more than £500m.Net debt is six times last year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Mr Pessina said Alliance Boots was expecting consumer demand in the UK to be subdued in the current year.Including VAT, like-for-like sales rose 1.2 per cent, and the company said baby products were one of the key battlegrounds with the supermarkets. Boots has about 2,500 stores on the British high street.George Fairweather, group finance director, refused to break out how much UK corporation tax Alliance Boots had paid in the year, stating only that it had paid total UK taxes of £240m, which included business rates and national insurance contributions.Alliance Boots’ total tax bill for the year on group operations was £59m. It received a £50m rebate for making special contributions into its two pensions funds, having invested £246m into the schemes.During the year, Alliance Boots struck a deal with Pension Insurance Corporation to insure itself against future costs associated with the Alliance UniChem portion of its pension scheme. It paid £80m to transfer the obligations of this scheme, and £20m into the Boots portion of the scheme. Both schemes are closed.Alliance Boots also said that it had set up a funding partnership with the Boots element of the pension scheme. The group paid £146m into the partnership, and also transferred a number of properties to it.The results mark a year of change for the group, in which it parted company with Andy Hornby, chief executive, and bolstered its international wholesaling business, buying controlling interests in its Hedef Alliance and ANZAG businesses in Turkey and Germany.Mr Pessina said Mr Hornby, formerly chief executive of HBOS, left because he “was stressed and had difficulties”, denying rumours of a conflict of personalities.He said he was “not in a hurry” to replace Mr Hornby.
165;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-05-03T19:17:52Z;Pessina is at Alliance Boots ‘for long term’;;"At an age when many executives are preparing for the golf course, Stefano Pessina, the 69-year-old executive chairman of Alliance Boots, is in the midst of another turbo-charged day running Europe’s largest pharmacy chain by number of stores.“I started this morning at 8.15, 8.10 with the person who is responsible for our corporate development team,” says the billionaire owner of the private group, who lives in Monte Carlo but is working from London.“After, I have a meeting with our treasurer, and after [that] I have a dinner. At 11 o’clock I will go to [the airport] and I will go back to Nice.”The entrepreneur, who took the group private with Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts in a £12.4bn deal four years ago, relishes this frantic pace.“I like doing this. I find it very stimulating, doing deals, thinking about the future of the company, discussing with my colleagues new ideas, new things to do ” says Mr Pessina.But life is set to become even more hectic.Alongside challenging trading conditions, Mr Pessina must deal with questions about the future financing and status of the group; and his own position at its helm.The British high street, where Alliance Boots has about 2,500 stores, is under pressure. “We believe that this will last for the next month, maybe for the rest of the year, maybe for the first part of next year,” he says. The consumer had hit “a little wall” over the past couple of months, with unemployment, inflation and slow wage growth creating a “feeling of uncertainty, and also, let’s say, a real situation of if not difficulties, at least of uneasiness, discomfort”.Meanwhile, the group’s wholesale pharmaceutical business faces pressure from governments keen to control spending on health services as they attempt to bring down borrowing.Despite these headwinds, Alliance Boots is on track to deliver another year of double-digit growth in trading profit – profit before goodwill amortisation and one-off items. Even so, shareholders will again not pay themselves a dividend this year.The strong performance is expected to take trading profit from £1.07bn in the year to March 31 2010 to well over £1bn in the year to March 2011, helped by a combination of strong organic growth and deals to take control of Hedef Alliance and Anzag, pharmaceutical wholesalers in Turkey and Germany, respectively. It is keen to make further acquisitions.Net debt is expected to fall from £8.4bn in the year to March 31 2010, to below £8bn after a reduction of more than £500m, helped by the group’s £1bn-plus annual cash generation.The debt matures between 2014 and 2017 and the continuing fragility of debt markets has fuelled speculation that the group is already preparing for a refinancing.Mr Pessina sounds relaxed. “We have time,” he says. “And in the meantime, of course, the debt will come down. It’s quite evident that if we can repay, or buy back, or accumulate cash to repay the debt . . . the easier it will be to refinance”.But given that the buy-out was struck back in 2007 and private equity groups typically keep their investments for five years, attention is turning to whether this implies an exit, most likely through an initial public offering, as soon as next year when Mr Pessina would be 70.Mr Pessina insists he and KKR have no firm timetable in mind.“It’s up to them, but I don’t believe that they are in a hurry,” he says.“If they wanted to exit, I would be happy to accommodate them, [but] they tell me that they are very happy about the development of the company.”As for his own plans – after all, he invested £1.27bn of his personal fortune in the buy-out – he maintains: “I am not a seller, so I don’t care very much about the market. This is an opportunity for KKR, and they will judge it [when they are ready]. I am quite indifferent, because I am a long, long-term investor”.Meanwhile, Mr Pessina has regained some of the responsibilities that he offloaded two years ago to Andy Hornby, the former head of HBOS, who unexpectedly quit as chief executive of Alliance Boots in March.Mr Pessina blames Mr Hornby’s exit on his former colleague’s decision to take on a stressful role so soon after his experience at HBOS.Alliance Boots is a hard-driving culture, he says, where the management team are “happy to work 12 hours a day, and to find new ideas. Andy was coming from a difficult experience probably, and he found that there was a lot of pressure.”He adds: “We are used to it, so we don’t feel it. Andy is very clever, very thoughtful, very personable. He was liked by everybody here, particularly by me. But probably this tense experience was too early for him.”Mr Hornby could not be reached for comment.Mr Pessina denies rumours of a rift between the two men. He also rejects suggestions that Mr Hornby found it hard to carve out a role for himself among the powerful trio at the top of the group: Mr Pessina himself, long-term Boots executive Alex Gourlay, at the head of Alliance Boots’ health and beauty division, and Ornella Barra – also Mr Pessina’s long-term partner – leading the pharmaceutical wholesale business.But that fact that there are no plans to replace Mr Hornby “for the time being”, suggests he did not leave a gaping hole. Instead, Mr Pessina refers to the group’s two “fantastic” divisional chief executives, and explains that while he now has some extra duties, he still has time “to think of the future of the group”.When the group does begin a search, it will be open to internal as well as external candidates, so Mr Gourlay and Ms Barra could apply.Given that Mr Pessina is at the age when many executives are thinking about retirement, could the search, when it happens, form part of a wider succession planning exercise?Mr Pessina acknowledges that this is something he will have to think about “sooner or later”.But in the meantime: “Without this very intense life, which I don’t find stressful at all I find quite relaxing, I have to say without it probably I would feel quite depressed.”"
166;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-04-05T02:46:37Z;Park Square raises €850m for new fund;;Park Square Capital has raised an €850m (£749m, $1.2bn) fund to invest in loans for leveraged buy-outs, as it seeks to take advantage of the regulatory pressure on banks to relinquish their traditional roles in financing private equity deals.Specialising in mezzanine debt, Park Square has already allocated a third of the new fund’s capital to seven private equity-led deals and will invest the rest over five years.Mezzanine debt, which ranks as more junior than senior bank loans, had a mixed performance during the crisis as a number of lenders’ investments were written off, yet many investors in the asset class were able to offset losses with the high yields they charge.“Our niche is boring companies,” said Robin Doumar, managing partner at Park Square. “Nothing sexy.” The group, which manages $3.5bn of capital, was a lead investor in two of the largest European mezzanine deals, namely the buy-outs of pharmacy chain Alliance Boots and cable group Ziggo.More recently it was part of a consortium, including Apollo Management, Cerberus and York Capital, which took control of Gala Coral by restructuring the betting group’s £2.5bn debt in June.Before the credit crisis, banks were the primary providers of such mezzanine financing. In the wake of the crisis, banks – especially those that were nationalised – are being pressed to shrink their balance sheets and limit their lending. “Banks are much more conservative today. The regulators do not want to see them lending mezzanine debt. They’ve largely exited the market,” said Mr Doumar.One example is Royal Bank of Scotland, which during the credit boom was one of Europe’s largest providers of debt financing. It sold a portfolio of about €250m of European mezzanine loans in October.However, some banks are still active in mezzanine debt. In January, Morgan Stanley raised $956m to invest in mezzanine debt of midsized companies.Mr Doumar reported strong interest in Park Square’s new fund from investors around the world, although the initial fundraising target of €1bn was missed.It was a “particularly challenging environment to be out there”, he said.
167;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Mayor to hold ‘riot summit’ with retailers;;West End retailers have persuaded Boris Johnson, mayor of London, to hold a “riot summit” with police and the Home Office to avoid a repeat of the violence and criminal damage during Saturday’s demonstrations in central London.Retailers including Fortnum & Mason, Topshop and Boots are counting the cost of the damage caused by breakaway groups of protesters who occupied stores, smashed shop fronts and threw paint and ammonia bombs.It is estimated that £5m of trade was lost as shops were forced to close. Police have now charged 150 people in connection with the protests. The New West End Company, which represents 600 retailers and businesses in the area, wrote to the mayor on Monday demanding action to protect the west end from future protests.“It is not acceptable that one of the world’s most important retail destinations is so regularly disrupted by a relatively small minority of individuals bent on random destruction and unrest,” said the letter from chairman Dame Judith Mayhew.In response to Dame Judith’s letter, which was copied to Nick Herbert, the Minister for policing and criminal justice, and Kit Malthouse, the chair of the Metropolitan Police, the mayor says he was “disgusted by the violence and disruption in central London,” and has asked Mr Malthouse “to convene the meeting you suggest”.Retailers want future marches to be routed away from shopping areas, and think organisers should provide “a bond or other insurance to pay for damage and clean-up costs”.Dame Judith lashed out at the police for not preventing a giant Trojan horse from being set on fire during the protests, stating: “I do not accept that a bonfire burning at Oxford Circus is anything other than totally unacceptable.”Many of the affected retailers had been branded as “tax dodgers” on the website of protest group UK Uncut. It claims to advocate peaceful protest, but lists Topshop, Boots, Vodafone and various UK banks as “targets”. Fortnum & Mason was occupied by 150 protesters as the group claims its owner, Wittington Investments, the biggest shareholder in Associated British Foods, avoids paying £10m tax a year by using a holding company in Luxembourg.West End bank branches of HSBC and Santander were also attacked. “We do feel that damage to our branches is entirely unjustified,” said a spokesman from HSBC. “HSBC is a top 10 UK taxpayer. In 2010 we paid $1.8bn tax in the UK, equal to almost all profit made from our UK personal and business customers.”Many retailers worked through the night to repair stores, and shopper numbers on Sunday were 21 per cent higher than a year ago as embattled consumers returned to the West End.
168;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-03-25T20:35:13Z;Alliance Boots chief in surprise departure;;Andy Hornby has resigned as chief executive of Alliance Boots and will leave the privately held UK pharmacy group with immediate effect, after less than two years in the job.His move to the retailer in July 2009 was controversial as he was previously chief executive of HBOS, until its near collapse at the height of the financial crisis. Mr Hornby was forced out, and the bank was ultimately taken over by Lloyds TSB.Mr Hornby, 44, said he had “decided to take a few months’ break” after “an intense last five years” as chief executive of HBOS and then Boots.The job at Boots was seen as an opportunity for Mr Hornby to burnish his reputation after presiding over HBOS’s aggressive growth in risky commercial property lending, which left the bank nursing heavy losses when the market collapsed.Lloyds has since written off billions of pounds of losses on HBOS loans, and the Financial Services Authority is conducting a wide-ranging investigation into the lender and its former management team.Mr Hornby came to Alliance Boots as chief executive two years after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity group, took it private in an £11bn buy-out in 2007. Stefano Pessina, executive chairman and part-owner alongside KKR, had been managing the company until Mr Hornby’s appointment, with the assistance of Ornella Barra and Alex Gourlay, who run the group’s wholesale pharmaceuticals and its health and beauty divisions, respectively.Mr Pessina stayed on as chairman after the buy-out, leaving Mr Hornby to forge a role for himself. Both Mr Gourlay and Ms Barra, who is Mr Pessina’s long-term partner, are still with the group.Mr Hornby is expected to receive a bonus of £1m for the financial year but will not receive any compensation for his departure.Boots’s sales have grown, and it has embarked on a string of acquisitions and partnerships, expanding internationally and at home. There had been speculation it would launch a large initial public offering in the next couple of years, but uncertainty in equity markets and a difficult retail environment have made such expectations recede.Additional reporting by Sharlene Goff
169;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-03-24T23:29:45Z;Enterprise zones have good prospects;;"Areas with immediate prospects for strong economic growth, rather than struggling locations, have been chosen by the government as the flagships of its low-tax enterprise zones.The first sites identified under the reinvigorated strategy, which was confirmed in Wednesday’s Budget, include Manchester airport, the UK’s fourth biggest airport, the Nottingham campus of Boots, the retailer and pharmacist, dockland near the London Olympic site and the Liverpool waterfront.Manchester airport is one of the most dynamic business areas of the city. Its new business park attracted the head office of PZ Cussons, the consumer goods company from Stockport, and Klarius, the vehicle parts maker.On Thursday Etihad, the Abu Dhabi-based airline, announced it would establish its European call-centre there, creating 160 jobs. It is unclear if it would benefit from tax breaks since the zone appears to be confined to a 60-acre site earmarked for development from 2011 between the airport and Wythenshawe, one of Europe’s largest housing estates.The Liverpool and Wirral zone encompasses an area that already has planning permission. Peel Holdings, which owns the former dockland, has plans for a £10bn development including a trade centre for Chinese companies.Colin Walton, who chairs the Nottingham-based D2N2 Local Enterprise Partnership, says the city’s zone, visited by David Cameron, prime minister, and Nick Clegg, deputy prime minister, could create between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs.The choice of locations is a sharp contrast with the 1980s-era zones, established in rundown former industrial areas, and criticised for sucking jobs from elsewhere and creating work that was not sustained after the tax breaks ran out.Alex Jones, chief executive for the Centre for Cities think-tank, said the government had followed its advice and chosen areas “with potential”. However, Ed Cox, director of Ippr north, the think-tank, said on Thursday: “There’s a very strong likelihood that the places they have chosen would have attracted investment irrespective of being designated as EZs.”The government is creating 21 EZs in England; the Budget confirmed 11, including the four specified on Thursday, and a competition has been launched among local enterprise partnerships for another 10.The EZs are the first real test for the new LEPs, partnership bodies bringing together local authorities, businesses, universities and the voluntary and community sectors.EZs constitute a challenge to put aside local rivalries, as the department for business has said it expects there will be only one EZ per LEP area.By discouraging LEPs from dividing up EZs, each expected to be 50 to 150 hectares, the government is obliging councils to focus on what will best achieve growth for their wider area.However, in north-east England, where the north eastern LEP held its inaugural meeting in Newcastle on Thursday with Mark Prisk, business and enterprise minister, in attendance, there are already indications of how difficult this may be, with a raft of proposed sites being floated.Dave Smith, chief executive of Sunderland council, which is under the same LEP umbrella as rival Newcastle, said Sunderland wanted an EZ. “The opportunity has to be about growing jobs and the economy for Sunderland people. That would best be realised in Sunderland.”The zones will offer a business rate discount up to £275,000 per eligible business over five years, fast-track planning and superfast broadband. All business rates growth for at least 25 years will be shared and retained to support economic priorities and ensure EZ growth is reinvested.Eric Pickles, local government secretary, said; “Enterprise zones are unashamedly pro-growth, with lower taxes and reduced regulations to attract businesses, but they are also unashamedly localist, keeping power and profits within the local area so communities benefit.”…………………………………………..Business park’s see-saw rideThe story of Quorum Business Park shows that enterprise zones can galvanise development, but that financial incentives alone cannot transform companies’ fortunes, writes Chris Tighe.Quorum was part of the Tyneside Riverside enterprise zone, the very last of the zones created in the 1980s and 1990s. After its status was bestowed in 1996, it attracted Viasystems, a producer of semiconductors, which built a large plant on the Quorum site but later failed.The 50-acre enterprise zone then switched its strategy to development as a business park which, over the past 18 months, has let 240,000 sq ft of space and created 2,000 jobs by attracting six occupiers, mostly inward investors into the area, including Tesco Bank and Balfour Beatty.“Over that period we’ve been the largest speculative office development outside central London,” says Fergus Trim, Quorum’s development director.Quorum, located on the northern edge of Newcastle, has 400,000 sq ft of office space let, 280,000 sq ft available and 240,000 sq ft under construction. The development did not get going until the tail end of enterprise zone concessions in the mid-2000s, following Viasystems’ failure.However, some investment benefits, in particular tax relief on development costs, continued for five years under so-called “golden contracts”. This enabled Quorum Development Partners to offer incomers attractive terms. On-site amenities include a
free-to-use sports club and a learning centre.Mr Trim said that, to work, zones need be aligned to the surrounding area’s growth strategy."
170;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Alliance Boots strikes deal with Carrefour;;Alliance Boots, the privately owned pharmacy chain, has struck a deal with Carrefour to produce beauty products for the world’s second biggest supermarket group.Under the terms of the deal, Boots’s contract manufacturing business will take versions of the chemist’s cosmetics, haircare, bathing and skincare products, among others, and produce these for Carrefour. The goods made by Boots will be sold under the Carrefour brand.Boots’s successful No 7 cosmetic brand will be excluded from the deal.Carrefour and Boots said they could further strengthen their co-operation by exploring healthcare partnerships in emerging markets.The agreement underlines the increasing importance of partnerships for Alliance Boots, taken private four years ago by Stefano Pessina, executive chairman, and KKR in a £12.4bn ($20.2bn) deal.Last year, Alliance Boots struck a deal with Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest consumer goods company, to help expand its nascent skincare business in Europe.In an unusual tie-up, P&G agreed to market and distribute Alliance Boots’s Laboratories Serum 7 skincare range to Italian pharmacy chains.In the UK, Boots has a trial with upmarket grocer Waitrose for the sale of selected products in each other’s stores, with Waitrose food in Alliance Boots stores, and Boots’s healthcare ranges in Waitrose.Lars Olofsson, chief executive of Carrefour, said the partnership with Boots would allow them to “make a quantum leap” in the beauty category. “This partnership will significantly enhance Carrefour’s attractiveness in a key category and should be a major contributor to becoming the preferred retailer.”Alex Gourlay, chief executive of Alliance Boots’s health and beauty division, said: “As we investigate healthcare possibilities together in emerging markets, we look forward to creating more opportunities for both organisations.”
171;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;‘Mega buy-out’ returns outpace stocks;;Debt-fuelled private equity “mega buy-outs” made in the run-up to the financial crisis have performed significantly better than previously thought, outpacing returns generated by stock markets in the same period.A study of 111 buy-outs worth more than $2bn made between 2005 and 2007 – now viewed as symbols of the credit binge that predated the banking crisis – shows that fewer than a third are valued below their purchase price in spite of being bought at record price multiples.Proprietary research by Skandia, the Swedish life insurance group that allocates 10 per cent of its €30bn ($41bn) of assets to private equity investments, found that large buy-outs generated returns of between 6 and 14 per cent per year more than public markets.“The buy-out model does appear to work also for large companies,” said Adalbjorn Stefansson, head of buy-out investments at Skandia Life. “This is an important conclusion as the whole concept of large buy-out deals has been questioned of late.”The performance of the buy-outs in the study was improved by not including fees in the calculation of performance, while the value of the majority of deals included had not yet been realised, so instead was judged by the buy-out groups and third parties.Large private equity deals in the run-up to the financial crisis, a period referred to in the study as the “golden era” of private equity, included KKR’s £9bn purchase of Alliance Boots, the UK’s largest pharmacy chain, and the ill-fated £4.2bn takeover of music group EMI by Guy Hands’ Terra Firma.“Clearly mistakes were made when it comes to the timing of investments. These managers should, with the benefit of hindsight, not have invested so heavily into the 2006-2007 period,” said Mr Stefansson.Difficulties for certain investments, such as those faced by Mr Hands, who unsuccessfully sued former adviser Citigroup over the EMI deal, have added to an impression among investors that many leveraged deals had performed poorly, a notion reinforced by many private equity groups failing to provide public data on their deals.“We can clearly see the evidence of these conclusions in our own portfolio. In general, performance has been good throughout this period,” said Kurt Björklund, co-managing partner of buy-out group Permira.Mr Björklund said large-scale buy-outs tended to be international groups that benefited from exposure to global economic growth and were able to attract the best management teams. Financing was also more easily available for larger private equity-owned companies.“Private equity is patient capital. You need to judge performance over a five- to 10-year investment cycle,” he said.
172;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Majority hostile to business tax avoidance;;Anti-tax avoidance protests targeting Vodafone, Topshop and Boots have tapped into growing hostility towards big business over the issue, a Financial Times-Harris poll shows.Six out of 10 British people taking part in the poll said they thought it was wrong for UK businesses to “employ controversial but legal means of reducing their tax contribution at a time of economic uncertainty”. Only 15 per cent of respondents agreed it was acceptable to use legal tax avoidance techniques.The poll also showed a big jump in the number of people opposed to the coalition government’s austerity measures. Half of people now think George Osborne’s spending cuts are likely to harm the economic recovery, compared with just 31 per cent when the question was last posed back in June.Evidence of the depth of public disquiet about the unfairness of corporate tax strategies will be seized on by UK Uncut, a “decentralised protest group” that is targeting Vodafone, Boots and stores owned by Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia fashion empire.The group’s original plan was to see if it could “get the issue of tax avoidance by massive corporations” on to the political agenda by staging one protest action against Vodafone. However, subsequent protests have forced Topshop stores in Oxford Street, London, and Manchester’s Arndale shopping centre to close.Business has attacked the campaign, with Sir Richard Lambert, the former director-general of the CBI employers’ body, arguing that it was “disingenuous” to promote the idea that public spending cuts could be offset significantly if big business paid a bigger share of tax.The CBI pointed out that corporation tax receipts account for nearly 10 per cent of all tax receipts and the overall business tax burden amounts to about a quarter of the total. It believes the business tax regime already threatens the UK’s position as a global commercial centre and that tougher rules would push more multinational companies to quit the country.There is also disagreement about the level of avoidance. UK Uncut cites a TUC estimate that UK tax avoidance costs £25bn a year. By contrast, official statistics published by Revenue & Customs estimate that avoidance costs about £7.4bn a year, of which £2.9bn is due to avoidance by big companies.The poll’s other key finding – that British people were becoming increasingly doubtful about the chancellor’s painful economic measures – will lend weight to the growing chorus of people calling for Mr Osborne to consider a “plan B”, not least from his Labour shadow, Ed Balls.The chancellor was spooked by data which showed the economy shrank in the last quarter of 2010 but said it would be wrong to even discuss alternative plans because it would alarm the financial markets.The FT/Harris poll showed the wariness about spending cuts was increasing across Europe. About half the people in Spain, Germany and Italy believe austerity measures are likely to harm the economic recovery, up from about three out of 10.
173;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-02-06T20:28:34Z;Tax: Trouble to avoid;Multinationals are increasingly in the sights of irate citizens and cash-strapped governments;"On an icy Sunday afternoon in January, high streets across Britain reverberated to chants of “Pay your tax”. Protesters wielding loudspeakers and leaflets railed against alleged tax-dodging by big companies at a time when the nation was facing as much as £80bn ($129bn) in public spending cuts.“The government has to stop the cuts,” said a young activist demonstrating outside a central London branch of Boots, the pharmacy chain. “They have to do something about tax avoidance.”The emergence of UK Uncut, a grassroots movement that has grown rapidly since its launch in a London pub last September, is being watched with dismay by government and business. The idea that spending cuts would be unnecessary if only everyone paid their taxes is “incredibly naive”, according to David Gauke, a Treasury minister.“UK Uncut worries people like me,” says a multinational executive. “It shows how much raw anger there is out there. It would be understandable if the facts were right.” He complains about ignorance over how much tax business actually pays in Britain – at least £150bn from all levies, more than one-quarter of all tax revenues. He acknowledges, however, a failure by companies to explain their strategies: “It is very hard to explain a tax structure without looking guilty.”Such large-scale public protests against corporate tax avoidance – which many businesses prefer to call effective tax planning – are, for the moment, unique to Britain. Agonising over the future of corporate tax is not. For governments dealing with the aftermath of the recession – not least yawning deficits and rising unemployment – it has become evident that globalisation has wrested control of multinationals’ tax affairs from the state’s hands, allowing companies unprecedented scope.As a result, a topic once seen as the Cinderella of economic policy is fast emerging as a global battleground. “The whole issue of international taxation can only get more important,” says Jeffrey Owens of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the rich nations’ club.The issue is rising up the global political agenda. On Friday, Angela Merkel, German chancellor, gave new impetus to proposals to narrow Europe-wide differences in corporate tax, demonstrating the extent to which the debate is now entwined with questions over the future of the eurozone. President Barack Obama last month called for the first US corporate rate cut in 25 years, to be funded by reforms of a code under which those who can work the system “ can end up paying no taxes at all”. In December, Japanese officials talked of a “strong sense of crisis” as they unveiled rate cuts and special tax breaks to improve competitiveness.In Britain, the protesters’ latest target is Alliance Boots, parent of the 160-year-old pharmacy chain. Its tax bills fell drastically after a highly leveraged £11bn takeover in 2007, which marked the peak of the private equity boom. What caught the eye of UK Uncut was the subsequent registration of its holding company in Zug, capital of the low-tax Swiss canton of the same name. The move is likely to keep tax bills low even when the company has paid off the debt and no longer has a big tax-deductible interest bill.Alliance Boots – which operates in more than 20 countries, including Russia and China – brushes off criticism, saying the Swiss holding company “will better reflect the increasingly international nature of our wider group”. It adds: “If we had registered in Switzerland purely for tax reasons there are many other countries that we could have considered.”Perhaps so – but Zug is of particular interest to many other businesses. Once best known for kirsch – brandy distilled from fermented cherries – the town is now famous for its rock-bottom tax rates. Located between mountains and an alpine lake, this picturesque backwater (population 25,000) today boasts nearly as many companies as people.The complaints of Switzerland’s neighbours led to a European Commission accusation four years ago that low-tax cantons offered “unfair tax advantages” to foreign companies in breach of a 35-year-old free trade accord.Bern rejected the charge but some global companies think it will eventually make concessions, even if that means extending low tax rates to domestic businesses. Peter Baumgartner, director of SwissHoldings, a grouping that represents Swiss-based multinationals, says: “In the longer run it will be difficult to defend the fact that foreign companies are paying less tax than Swiss companies.”Tax-based tension between governments is mirrored in attitudes towards Ireland. Hostility to its policy of low corporate tax – seen as a cornerstone of “brand Ireland” – was laid bare during negotiations over a European Union bail-out last November. The dispute lingers. “I deeply respect the independence of our Irish friends and we have done everything to help them,” President Nicolas Sarkozy of France said in January. “But they cannot continue to ask us to come and help us while keeping a tax on company profits that is half [what other countries have].”New business models are ratcheting up such disputes. In the past decade, large multinationals have increasingly moved their “intangible” assets – such as patents, brands, treasury operations, all of which account for a big share of taxable profits – to low-tax countries. Switzerland, Ireland and Singapore are the favoured destinations, accounting together for at least 20 per cent of US intangibles, according to the OECD.This trend has presented a more serious threat to the tax bases of industrialised countries than conventional avoidance schemes, which revenue authorities can tackle with disclosure notices and legislation. In response, governments are ever more aggressive in their application of rules designed to stop revenues shifting to low-tax countries. But the search for more effective remedies continues.So far, the results are not encouraging. A UK proposal to impose taxes worldwide on passive income – royalties, interest and dividends – was dropped in 2008 after it precipitated the departure of a clutch of big multinationals such as WPP, the advertising group. London is now relaxing existing rules and is taking a lead from competitors such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, which offer special concessions for patents, a particularly mobile source of income.An OECD attempt to orchestrate a new approach to international rules on intangibles has so far failed. Multinationals successfully argued that the centralisation and relocation of operations such as brand management were business decisions that could not be attacked as tax-motivated.Another approach, which is being pushed by charities and campaign groups, is to require greater disclosure by multinationals on what they pay where, in an effort to shame them into paying more. Mike Devereux, a professor at Oxford university, says companies are well aware of the potential costs – in terms of reputational damage, more intrusive audits and uncertainty – to companies that produce a much lower tax bill than their rivals. “If you are a large business, you don’t want to get too far out of line.”But there are clear limits to the power of reputational threats. As multinationals increase their global reach, loyalty to their home country declines. Directors feel obliged to consider measures to drive down tax, which is often their second largest cost after labour. Moreover, the law is ultimately the only arbiter of what is owed. “Simply demonising tax avoiders and exhorting them to behave better is …a feeble stratagem,” according to a recent publication by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a London-based think-tank.Instead, governments are considering radical reforms. In March, the European Commission will unveil a blueprint for a bloc-wide tax base for companies. European tax revenues would be divided up according to sales, assets and employees in each member state. As well as cutting businesses’ compliance burden – its stated aim – the proposal would reduce the scope for tax planning. However, it is unlikely to be taken up by all members.An even more radical option is to abandon corporate tax altogether in its current form. “It is very hard to tax capital in the way we try to tax it now by identifying where it is located,” says Prof Devereux. “The more I think about it the more crazy it is.” A better approach to taxing profits would, he says, be a form of value added tax.Corporate tax would be mourned by few economists; most argue that it depresses wages and damages economic growth. But few politicians would countenance its abolition, particularly as the levy remains an important contributor to national treasuries – albeit dwarfed by the other charges that businesses pay.Corporate tax’s share of total tax revenues in OECD countries actually increased from 8 per cent in 1990 to 10 per cent in 2008. This apparent resilience may be misleading, however: economists believe the figures are flattered by individuals using corporate structures to avoid personal tax.The preservation of corporate tax revenues is likely to require a concerted effort to eliminate loopholes and broaden its base. “Over the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries,” Mr Obama told the US public in last month’s state of the union address. But resisting pressure from businesses is easier said than done. Few ministers feel able to ignore warnings from chief executives that, if pressed too hard, they will take their investment and jobs elsewhere.Apparently relentless competition for jobs and revenues will result in sustained downward pressure on tax rates, according to the OECD’s Mr Owens. Along with the trend towards increased consumption taxes paid by rich and poor alike, a structural change is under way that is “probably leading to a less progressive system”. Governments should look at other approaches – involving wealth and inheritance taxes, for example – to share the burdens and rewards of globalisation. He adds: “There has to be a role in the tax system to reduce inequality.”The message is a challenging one for governments. Their struggle to improve competitiveness is likely to exacerbate grievances among voters about the unfairness of the system. Tax protests are a symptom of a concern that is unlikely to go away.In Britain, UK Uncut, which styles itself as an “army of citizen volunteers determined to make wealthy tax avoiders pay”, is preparing again to hit the streets. “We have hit a nerve,” says one. “We are not going to stop.”"
174;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-01-17T22:07:08Z;Alliance Boots enjoys ‘robust’ trading;;Alliance Boots, the privately owned pharmacy chain, increased sales by 14.3 per cent in its third quarter but warned that conditions would remain challenging in 2011.Alliance Boots, taken private four years ago by Stefano Pessina, executive chairman, and KKR in a £12.4bn deal, said that, excluding exchange rate movements, the increase was 15.6 per cent in the three months to December 31, helped by acquisitions in its pharmaceuticals wholesale division.Andy Hornby, the former HBOS chief executive, who is at the helm of Alliance Boots, said: “This represents a robust performance and demonstrates the ability of our group to deliver growth even in tough economic conditions.”He added: “Overall, the group performed strongly in spite of the challenging trading conditions we continue to see across Europe. We are pleased with our progress and are well positioned to deliver a strong financial performance in 2010-11.”Sales from Boots’ UK stores open at least a year rose 2.8 per cent, including value added tax, with dispensing volumes up 3.1 per cent.Mr Hornby said that in December, Boots’ UK sales were “especially pleasing”, rising 3.8 per cent on a like-for-like basis, including VAT, in spite of disruption from wintry weather in the run-up to Christmas. The supply chain also held up in the Arctic conditions.Healthcare products, fragrances and electrical beauty had performed particularly well, with Boots lifting its market share in its core health and beauty categories, he added.Sales in the pharmaceuticals wholesale division rose 24.4 per cent in the third quarter, helped by acquisitions. In July, Alliance Boots became the majority shareholder in Hedef Alliance in Turkey, while last month it completed the acquisition of Anzag in Germany. Like-for-like sales excluding the acquisitions and currency movements rose 1.9 per cent.Mr Hornby warned that it was “likely that the financial climate will remain challenging throughout 2011”. Alliance Boots would have to “continue to work hard” to meet its targets for the final quarter of its year to March 31.“I am confident that we will achieve these and report another year of strong profit growth in May,” said Mr Hornby.
175;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2011-01-13T20:57:31Z;Employee ideas thrown to the dragons;;The boardroom is buzzing with a mix of excitement and nerves. A team of employees optimistically watches as the executive directors assess their prototype: a dainty black box crafted from recycled paper for a proposed postal gift scheme.The future of their idea sits in the hand of the director of talent. “What happens to this in the post?” she asks. Without waiting for an answer, she crushes both the box and the team’s hopes.If that sounds like a scene out of Dragons’ Den, well, it is. Just not the television version. Rather, this was at Addiction Worldwide, a London-based communications agency. The team are employees participating in a team-building and training event that has been styled on the programme.“The blueprint is already there,” says James Lizars, finance director at the company. “You only need to start to describe it, and employees say: ‘Ah, like Dragons’ Den?’”Similar scenes are happening in boardrooms and breakout areas across the UK. Typically, employees are asked to come up with product ideas or process innovations based on certain criteria. Once the ideas have been filtered, shortlisted teams pitch their ideas to a panel of dragons – typically, members of the executive team – who offer their views.Asda, the supermarket chain owned by Walmart, and Boots, the UK pharmacy chain, run similar schemes, and commit to integrating the winning idea into the business.At Asda, Sarah Cullen, head of reward and recognition, believes the buzz around the TV programme is key to getting staff engaged with the process. “If we had said ‘this is the Asda ideas scheme’, people would be less likely to get involved.”The company takes this one step further by enlisting the judging talents of Peter Jones, a real-life TV dragon. Boots also boasts Mr Jones among its dragons, as well as Karren Brady from The Apprentice and Adrian Moorhouse, the former Olympic swimmer turned management consultant.Both of their efforts, however, pale in comparison to Tata Global Beverages’ Think BIG! scheme. The process covers 26 locations in 10 countries, including brands such as Tetley Tea in the UK, 8 O’Clock Coffee in the US and Tata tea and coffee in India.The competition first ran in 2010 with regional finals in London, New Jersey and Bangalore. Participants were voted on at each event by an X Factor-style panel of judges and audience made up of employees, while others watched and voted on their laptops. The regional winners were whisked off to the finals at Radio City Music Hall in New York.Tata was coy about revealing the winning idea, citing commercial sensitivity – a sign of how seriously such competitions are taken – but the runners-up included a pitch for a protein tea, presented by a team dressed in sumo suits.A former Asda winner invented a flapjack that now shifts 6,000 units in stores every week.Louise Bull, the winner of last year’s inaugural competition at Boots, came up with an online communications system between stores and support staff that is now running UK-wide.“Seeing your idea actually land in-store is the best thing,” she says.And the best thing for the business is getting such ideas for free, while making employees feel rewarded.But is there a drawback to appointing managers as judges, amplifying a feeling of “us and them”? Not for Ms Bull. “Everybody got an opportunity to speak to our senior leaders – it was a great way to break down some barriers,” she says.Entrepreneur and TV dragon Duncan Bannatyne believes such competitions are good for business. “If the person who presents to you has got a great idea, it’s his first time presenting to people and he learns from that, and the company gains from that – why not?” he says.In fact, he may institute one at his own company.

It said 55 protests took place around the UK.The group, which organises using social networking tools such as Facebook and Twitter, is protesting against the government’s public sector cuts and what it says are widespread tax avoidance schemes by corporations and the wealthy that cost the exchequer up to £25bn per year.Police said 150 protesters targeted Top Shop, the Oxford Street flagship of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia fashion empire.UK Uncut has criticised Sir Philip because his family was able to take a £1.2bn tax-free dividend from the Arcadia group in 2005, as the company is owned by his wife, Lady Tina, who is a resident in Monaco rather than the UK.Demonstrators blew whistles, handed out leaflets, and sat in groups on the floor of the store, in a ‘sports day’ event intended to highlight what they say are £160m cuts to school sports programmes.One group held up a banner that read “Philip Green, Top Shop owner, cuts adviser, tax dodger.” The crowd chanted slogans such as: “Pay your tax” and: “No ifs, no buts, no public sector cuts.”Several protesters were removed by security. Customers carried on shopping until police blocked the entrance.Terry Williams, from London, was one of the protesters removed from the store. He said it was appropriate to target shops at the busy Christmas time. “It really strikes a chord with people. Its part of a growing wave of people willing to take direct action. Ending tax avoidance is the most just way of making up the deficit shortfall.”BHS on Oxford Street was also the scene of a sit-in by about 30 activists, who gathered inside the main entrance. The crowd shouted “Nick Clegg shame on you for turning blue.” Police and security staff eventually sealed the doors.A quieter protest took place outside Vodafone’s Oxford Street mobile phone store, where activists staged a “read-in,” a sit down protest to highlight government cuts to local government budgets and library services.UK Uncut says Vodafone avoided paying £6bn in tax through a dispute settlement with Revenue & Customs, enough to pay for the services being cut. Vodafone says reports suggesting it had an outstanding tax bill of £6bn are “incorrect”.Vodafone closed the store before the protest began. Chris Whitrow, from Croydon, was one of the protesters outside the Vodafone store. Holding a copy of Bettany Hughes’ Helen of Troy, Mr Whitrow said he didn't feel shoppers should feel too inconvenienced by the disruption. “Its not a life or death issue, but the NHS is,” he said.Today the group announced it was also targeting HSBC, with a ‘sleep in’ protest by a group of about 20 activists occupying the bank’s Covent Garden outlet in the morning.Chris Tobin from UK Uncut said targets around the UK also included Boots and Marks and Spencer stores. “I’m sure the weather put some people off but the response has been amazing,” he said.The Metropolitan Police said four arrests had been made in the Oxford Street area for aggravated trespass, assault and criminal damage.Arcadia could not be reached for comment. Vodafone said that protests had affected less than 5 per cent of its stores, and the impact on trading was minimal. It added: “Vodafone pays its taxes. Vodafone has no unpaid tax bill.”
177;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-11-03T09:31:17Z;Alliance Boots sales boosted by acquisitions;;Acquisitions in both its pharmaceutical wholesaling business and high-street stores have boosted sales at Alliance Boots, the pharmaceutical and beauty group, in the first six months of its financial year.“We are pleased with the way the group has performed given the challenging trading conditions across Europe,” said Andy Hornby, chief executive of AllianceBoots and former head of HBOS, the UK bank.“Boots has delivered a good performance in a difficult UK consumer environment and we have increased market share in our core health and beauty categories. Our pharmaceutical wholesale division has performed strongly right across our international markets.”For the six months to the end of September, revenues at the group rose 6 per cent, or 6.6 per cent, in constant currency to £8.95bn.AllianceBoots, which was bought by private equity group KKR and Stefano Pessina, executive chairman, for £11.1bn in 2007, owns Europe’s largest chain of pharmacies by number of stores.Sales at the pharmaceutical wholesale business, which comprises two-thirds of group revenues, grew by 7.7 per cent to £5.9bn, with most of the increase coming from acquisitions.In July, Alliance Boots increased its stake in Hedef Alliance, a Turkish pharmaceutical wholesaler, from 50 per cent to 60 per cent. Excluding this increased stake, like-for-like sales in the pharmaceutical wholesaling division rose by 0.6 per cent.Other recent acquisitions include an agreement last month to acquire a further 52 per cent stake in ANZAG, one of the three large pharmaceutical wholesalers in Germany, which also has operations in Lithuania, Romania and Croatia.The division is currently undergoing its second phase of restructuring in order to cut costs. The group will reduce headcount by 2 per cent, cutting costs by about £24m a year. These cuts are in addition to 900 jobs announced last month at its health and beauty division.In the health and beauty division, which includes the Boots chain of high-street beauty and pharmacy stores, sales rose 2 per cent to £3.6bn, also helped by acquisitions. In May 2009, Boots completed the acquisition of Dollond & Aitchison, the opticians chain, pushing up revenues at Boots opticians by 10 per cent in the half-year. Excluding this acquisition, like-for-like sales rose by 0.3 per cent.Boots said initial results from a co-marketing experiment with the grocery chain Waitrose had been encouraging. A combined Waitrose and Boots lunchtime food range is now available in 12 Boots stores, and a larger Waitrose convenience food range is now available in seven larger Boots stores. Boots health and beauty products are also being sold at 12 Waitrose stores.Boots stores were also helped by growth outside the UK, where revenues rose 6.7 per cent in constant currency. While riots in Thailand and the economic slump in Ireland depressed sales, Boots also trades in Norway and the Netherlands, where it is extending the roll-out of Boots-branded stores beyond its initial five stores.
178;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-10-25T20:15:31Z;Business chiefs demand clarity on growth;;"Leading politicians’ efforts to impress business with their vision to promote private sector growth fell short on Monday as industry leaders welcomed the government’s self-proclaimed “relentless focus on growth” – but criticised the lack of a coherent plan.“The government has not yet articulated a full growth strategy,” said David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, at the CBI annual conference. He argued that business wanted more detail on how government would prioritise resources, remove barriers and incentivise private sector growth.“[We] want to see more meat on the bones,” said Neil Rami, head of Business Birmingham, the city’s inward investment programme.David Cameron, prime minister, did unveil some initiatives at the conference, sketching out a “strategy for growth” centred on promoting trade and directing resources towards new industries, green technologies and Britain’s infrastructure.The government is to invest £200m in high-tech economic clusters – drawing on the German Fraunhofer model – to connect industry with the country’s research base. A further £60m will help develop Britain’s offshore wind power industry.He also hinted the government could, in coming weeks, offer concessions on its controversial plan to impose immigration caps on skilled workers from outside the EU. He promised his audience he would not impede them “from attracting the best talent from around the world”.His comments were welcomed by Vince Cable, the business secretary, who was embroiled in a bruising row with Number 10 over immigration caps last month. “That the prime minister spoke in these terms showed that the message has been heard loud and clear,” he told the Financial Times on Monday.A more coherent economic strategy would be set out in the government’s growth white paper, aides said. The paper was originally meant to be published soon after the comprehensive spending review on October 20 as part of government efforts to develop a narrative for the deficit reduction programme not solely focused on cuts. But it has now been delayed until the end of this year at the earliest.Meanwhile Ed Miliband used his first significant speech on the economy as Labour leader to focus on fears that the government’s £81bn of cuts could push Britain into a double-dip recession. He sought to reassure industry that his was a pro-business Labour party, but turned his fire on what he saw as the coalition’s risky focus on bringing down Britain’s debt burden without regard to the potential impact on the wider economy.“We can accept an analysis that nothing matters bar deficit reduction,” he said. “But I fear that is a gamble with growth and jobs.”His view was not shared among business people in the audience. Stefano Pessina, the billionaire businessman and executive chairman of Alliance Boots, said he supported the coalition’s deficit reduction plan. “To be honest, the problem is there and it is better to act on it as soon as possible. I have absolute confidence there will not be a double-dip recession. The economy is recovering slowly. People have accepted what we have gone through and we will survive.”Mr Cable could not resist a jibe at his coalition colleagues as he used the conference to unveil details of his consultation into pay, corporate governance and takeovers.“I don’t mean to be mischievous when I point out even my Conservative coalition colleagues were busy developing policies about ‘sharing the process of growth’,” said the business secretary reflecting on attitudes before the economic crisis. “Those of us who were worrying publicly about the unsustainable build-up of household debt, the housing bubble and the lending practices of banks were regarded as eccentrics or party poopers.”Mr Cable warned banks “not to engage in another self-indulgent bonus round” in the new year.He also signalled he would be looking for a bigger shake-up of takeover rules following the Takeover Panel’s decision to give companies better protection against so-called virtual bids, which allow bidders to make an approach without committing themselves to a firm offer.Steps towards a supportive environmentThree economists give their views:John Hawksworth,
chief economist, PwC
What is striking is how much the leaders agree on. Common ground encompasses the need to reduce the deficit significantly; reform welfare to boost employment; increase competition in banking particularly for the SME sector; and take a more active role in supporting relatively new industries such as green manufacturing and biosciences.The differences seem more about tactics than strategy, particularly on the speed of deficit reduction. The government was prudent to take some tough decisions on public spending. But if the economy shows signs of stalling next year, then there may need to be flexibility in moderating the pace of the fiscal squeeze while sticking to the objective of structural current budget balance by 2015-16, which current plans suggest will be achieved one year ahead of target.Since Alistair Darling was aiming to achieve the same fiscal objective by 2016-17, the eventual difference in the speed of deficit reduction between the parties may turn out to be fairly minor. Capital spending plans now are almost identical to those of the last Labour government and current departmental spending plans are also broadly similar. The big difference is a deeper cut in welfare spending by the coalition government, much of which Ed Miliband now says he would support. For businesses wanting stability of policy across governments of different political parties, this broad consistency of approach is good news.Sushil Wadhwani,
former monetary policy committee member
I think David Cameron and Ed Miliband underestimate the importance of greater macroeconomic stability for business investment. Moreover, they seem to believe reforming financial regulation will avert the next financial crisis. History suggests that bubbles, and the busts that inevitably follow, have occurred in a variety of different environments for business, including different regulatory regimes and microeconomic policies. As Keynes recognised, we need to cushion the economy from the volatility induced by “animal spirits” by making monetary and fiscal policy more oriented towards the achievement of macroeconomic stability. However, neither is willing to grasp that nettle as yet.Tim Besley,
professor at the London School of Economics and former MPC member
The medium-term growth agenda concerns how we develop the preconditions for the productive potential of the economy to expand. That depends much more on skills, innovation and infrastructure. And both David Cameron and Ed Miliband obviously appreciate that. The question is whose vision of a supportive policy environment is right.We still have some way to go before we have world-class infrastructure and we could certainly do more to foster links between the science base and business. The prime minister’s announcement on the latter is potentially exciting. But one could easily be sceptical about the ability of government to pick winners even though there are historical examples.I am sure there will be some rebalancing towards manufacturing in coming years, and support of the skills and infrastructure base could surely help. But this means making sure the coalition is focused on the need to maintain investment."
179;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-10-19T22:01:12Z;Foreign raiders dominate UK M&A;Overseas- top domestic-led deals for first time;The value of cross-border mergers and acquisitions of UK-based companies so far this year has exceeded domestic-led deals for the first time, driven by increased appetite from groups in the US, Hong Kong and Germany.In the wake of the £11.6bn takeover of Cadbury, the Birmingham-based chocolate maker, by Kraft of the US, there has been a flurry of cross-border M&A in the UK, according to new data from Dealogic.UK inbound cross-border M&A hit $84.4bn in the year to date, outstripping the domestic-led dealmaking volume of $61.6bn.Foreign-led acquisitions of UK companies, including the pending £11.2bn takeover of International Power by France’s GDF Suez, have this year already outstripped the $70.5bn seen in the whole of last year.But they are still well below the $191.2bn seen at the peak of the credit-fuelled M&A bubble in 2007, when several big UK groups were taken over by foreign acquirers, such as pharmacy chain Alliance Boots.The biggest source of cross-border buyers this year was the US, which accounted for $45.3bn of deals, followed by Hong Kong with $9.8bn and Germany with $4.1bn.Many of the big foreign-led deals in the UK this year have come from private equity, such as the £2.9bn buy-out of Tomkins, the automotive and industrial parts maker, by Onex and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.Cross-border deals seem set to continue, after Liverpool football club agreed to be bought for £300m by New England Sports Ventures of the US and United Biscuits, the snack maker, entered talks to be bought for £2.5bn by Bright Food of China.

181;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-10-14T18:52:42Z;Overseas focus by Mothercare pays off;;Mothercare’s focus on overseas expansion appears to be working, with first-half international retail sales overtaking domestic sales for the first time at the babycare group.“Overall the volume of sales is higher now [internationally] than in the UK, and that will get bigger over time,” said Ben Gordon, chief executive.Worldwide sales including the UK, rose 7 per cent for the 13 weeks to October 9. Second-quarter international retail sales rose 14.2 per cent, slowing from the 20.3 per cent growth registered in the first quarter.The company blamed the slowing in international growth on August’s wildfires in Russia and the timing of Eid, the Muslim festival.Sales at UK stores open at least a year fell by 3.2 per cent in the second quarter after a 4.1 per cent decline in the first quarter.Mr Gordon said the company was cautious about the second half, which will include the important Christmas-shopping period.However, Mr Gordon said he was optimistic about Mothercare’s partnership to sell clothing by means of the Boots chain of pharmacies.“What we’re doing in the UK is taking a cautious approach to consumer spending in the future,” Mr Gordon said.“We’re not planning for huge like-for-like growth,” he said.The company plans to open 150 stores outside the UK this year – 50 more than it had previously estimated.The new stores will be spread worldwide, Mr Gordon said. There would be a particular emphasis on India, China, Russia and the Middle East.Mothercare operates in 54 countries with 1,217 stores, including 840 outside the UK.Analysts’ consensus forecast for 2011 pre-tax profit is £42.8m ($68.5m), up from £32.5m last year.The interim dividend is expected to rise from 15.4p to 18.32p.One analyst cautioned that – although most other retailers have returned to positive UK like-for-like sales growth – Mothercare would continue to struggle as the supermarket groups Tesco and Asda were also branching out into toys and babycare products.Mothercare’s shares fell 12p to close at 504½p.
182;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-10-11T17:15:30Z;GlaxoSmithKline tie-up puts students to work;;"GlaxoSmithKline is to put British university students to work to discover the drugs of the future in a training programme that will tap into the skills of the next generation of chemists at minimal cost.The UK-based pharmaceuticals group will next week launch a medicinal chemistry module using students in their third year of Master of Science study at the University of Nottingham.The students will try to construct new chemical-based drugs designed to link to disease “targets” under investigation.The move comes as large pharma companies attempt to strengthen partnerships with academia as they struggle to boost innovation in research while reducing the overheads.It could help provide a model to better prepare them for future funding difficulties, as British universities brace for likely government budget cuts to higher education with greater focus on more applied training and research.It also offers the potential for students aged in their early 20s to become named inventors on patents, who would receive royalties if their work was translated into a successful drug.The model reflects the latest variant on long-standing links between employers and higher education, including the University of Nottingham, which was built on land donated by Jesse Boot, the founder of Boots, the retail chemist chain that itself was a developer of medicines.Dave Allen, head of chemistry at GSK, said the approach built on the company’s existing work with postgraduates, and could lead to a longer-term alliance with academia. “This is not a way of saving money, but we are not a charity and we get something back. Our people will mentor, and get a sense of innovation from students.”The new Nottingham project, to run over two terms with 12 students, will focus on research, synthesis and testing of PI 3 kinase inhibitors, which are important for inflammation and are under investigation by a number of drug companies. GSK is studying their potential in the treatment of asthma.GSK announced the restructuring two years ago of its research around a series of “drug performance units” focused on individual biological disease pathways; 47 of the 85 projects now under way are conducted by its external partners.Chris Moody, Sir Jesse Boot Professor and head of organic chemistry at the University of Nottingham, said: “This collaboration represents a unique opportunity to …develop the UK’s chemistry talent.”"
183;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-10-04T21:30:11Z;Alliance Boots to cut 900 jobs;;Alliance Boots, the private equity-owned pharmacy chain, is to cut 900 jobs over the next three years in the latest round of restructuring since its £12.4bn buy-out in 2007.The group, which was taken private by Stefano Pessina, executive chairman, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, said the cuts affected back-office roles in its health and beauty division and related manufacturing activities, with most at its Nottingham site. No store-based staff would be affected.The job losses may spark fresh controversy over the role of private equity, which three years ago was dragged into a heated spat with unions about job cuts, that ended with buy-out bosses being called before a parliamentary inquiry into their industry.However, Alex Gourlay, chief executive of Alliance Boots’ health and beauty division, insisted: “It’s nothing to do with private equity. It’s all to do with what we think is the ongoing good management of our business and the brands that Boots owns.”Insiders point out that there has been a net increase of more than 1,500 jobs across the group since it was taken private.Alliance Boots said the cuts, less than 10 per cent of the UK non-store workforce in the businesses, would reduce operating costs by £56m a year, by 2013-14. It would incur a one-off cost of about £67m.Mr Gourlay said the job losses, of which 750 would be in Nottingham, with the remainder spread throughout the UK, had been driven by a new information technology system, which would cut the number of people needed to track data. In addition, several projects undertaken in the wake of the acquisition were now coming to an end. Finally, Alliance Boots wanted to cut the number of management layers, which would mean very roughly 150 of the 900 reductions would be management positions.He said Alliance Boots hoped to minimise the number of redundancies, through redeploying people to other parts of the business, or to new projects that would be starting over the next three years, and a “few hundred” jobs out of the 900, could ultimately be lost.Retailers are concerned about conditions next year, as consumers grapple with higher taxes and possible job cuts in the public sector.Mr Gourlay said Alliance Boots’ move was not driven by the economy. “We have been trading well, and we continue to trade well,” he said.Paul Maloney, national officer of the GMB union, said: “This is really bad news. We will be seeking urgent talks with the company to find out what is behind this.”

185;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Goldman veteran to join Glaxo as finance chief;;Simon Dingemans, one of Goldman Sachs’ veteran dealmakers in London, is leaving the bank to join drugmaker GlaxoSmith-Kline as chief financial officer at a time when global mergers and acquisitions activity is starting to heat up.Mr Dingemans, the head of Goldman’s European M&A business, will join Glaxo in January after a 15-year career at the bank, where he advised companies such as Boots, the UK pharmaceutical retailer, on its merger with Alliance UniChem, its pan-European counterpart, in 2006.He was made partner at the bank in 2000 after advising Sir Christopher Gent, then chief executive of Vodafone, on its €111bn hostile bid for Mannesmann, which is still the world’s biggest hostile takeover. Sir Christopher is chairman of Glaxo.Under Mr Dingemans’ leadership, Goldman Sachs has consistently ranked as one of the top three M&A advisers in both the UK and continental Europe.This year, Goldman ranks top globally for announced M&A, with $384bn worth of deals, and fifth for deals targeting European companies, worth $51.7bn, according to Thomson Reuters.“Simon is a very bright, quick and experienced banker, but above it all has excellent judgment and we are sorry and sad to see him go,” said Yoel Zaoui, head of European investment banking at Goldman.“But we have a deep bench of outstanding young and senior bankers in the UK who will continue to expand our franchise,” Mr Zaoui added.Mr Dingemans has worked closely with Glaxo for many years, most recently helping to establish ViiV Healthcare, a specialist HIV company. He will replace Julian Heslop, who is retiring in March.His move is the reverse of that taken by Jon Symonds, the former chief financial officer at GSK’s rival AstraZeneca, who was hired by Goldman Sachs in 2007. Mr Symonds left two years later to rejoin the pharmaceutical sector as CFO at Novartis of Switzerland.Glaxo officials played down suggestions that his nomination marked any change in strategy towards corporate finance or deal-making, such as a shift away from its preference for smaller “bolt-on” acquisitions rather than large-scale mergers and acquisitions.“Making a move to be a CFO is something I have been keen to do for some time,” Mr Dingemans told the Financial Times. “I have worked with GSK for many years and this is a dynamic sector undergoing significant change.”Mr Dingemans is one of the few bankers left in the City of London who is a pure generalist with the access to the boardrooms of most FTSE 100 companies.Some of his biggest clients include defence company BAE Systems, Vodafone, AllianceBoots and Standard Chartered.
186;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-08-31T22:37:14Z;Alliance Boots insures pension benefits;;Alliance Boots said it has insured itself against any further possible costs associated with a portion of its final salary pension scheme, which it closed to further accruals at the end of June this year.The Alliance Unichem section of its scheme – acquired when Boots merged with the company in July 2006 – has had all of its benefits insured against further losses through a contract with Pension Insurance Corp.The scheme has around £300m in assets and Alliance Boots said it had made a small top-up to that in order to secure the insurance contract. It represents about 15 per cent of the total liabilities and has roughly 3,000 members, two-thirds of whom are already drawing pensions.The move is in line with a growing trend among employers to reduce, or even completely shed, the enormous risks of offering defined benefit pensions that are a percentage of the salary earned in the year before retirement.Pension schemes have been savaged in recent years by sharp falls in stock and property markets which reduced asset values, and by the sharp fall in yields on risk-free bonds which raise calculations of liabilities. They have also been hit by rising life expectancy.The Alliance Boots pension scheme made a high profile move to reduce its risks in 1999 when its former director of corporate finance implemented an investment strategy to buy assets that moved in line with liabilities. As a result, the scheme sold all of its equities holdings and invested in fixed-interest and index-linked gilts, and has long been one of the UK’s most financially secure schemes.However, at the time the company was in talks to be taken private by a consortium led by Stefano Pessina, its then deputy chairman, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, trustees to the scheme demanded that the buyers fill a £1bn hole in the scheme.Among other things the Trustees noted that the valuation used at the time significantly understated the likely life expectancy of scheme members.
187;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Alliance Boots moves for Turkey’s Hedef;Most significant deal since store’s buy-out;Alliance Boots will on Monday announce it is taking control of one of Turkey’s biggest drug wholesalers.Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of the drug distribution and retail chain, has described the deal as the most significant since it was taken private three years ago.Mr Pessina who, along with KKR spent £11.1bn taking Alliance Boots private in Europe’s biggest buy-out, told the Financial Times that the deal would enable Alliance Boots to move more aggressively into Africa as well as give it a base from which to expand into the Middle East.“This is the first big deal we have done since the acquisition. We have done Megapharm and others, but they were smaller deals.”He declined to comment on how much Alliance Boots was spending to take control of Hedef Alliance – Alliance Boots spent £38m in 2001 on a 25 per cent stake and a further £36m on another 25 per cent in 2002 – but said it was a “significant” sum.It is thought that Mr Pessina and KKR could be spending about £100m on the stake. The wholesaler has consolidated revenue of £2.4bn, against Alliance Boots’ £18.7bn of sales in the year to March 2010.Market sources say Hedef is probably worth a little more than its rival Selcuk Ecza, which has a market capitalisation of TL1.4bn (£596m).Mr Pessina and KKR have invested £1bn so far in Alliance Boots, mainly on its stores in the UK where it owns the Boots pharmacy chain. It has also made efforts to develop the UK business, signing deals with Mothercare and Waitrose to cross-sell goods as well as merging its optician branches with the D&A chain.The Italian-born billionaire, who merged his drugs distribution business Alliance Unichem with Boots the chemist before then orchestrating the buy-out, said he was now focusing his attention on the wholesale business.“This is the first of a number of acquisitions where we can start to crystallise work we have done on the distribution side of the business,” he said.“Turkey is a fantastic hub for all of the region of the Middle East. From Turkey we should be able to do deals with neighbouring countries.”Hedef has a controlling stake of 50 per cent of the leading wholesaler in Egypt, Africa’s second-largest pharmaceutical market after South Africa.It also has an associate interest in the largest wholesaler in Algeria, which is Africa’s third-biggest drug market. Alliance Boots operates in more than 20 markets across the world.
188;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;DFS prepares £240m bond issue;;DFS is hoping to raise £240m ($367m) from a bond issue to repay the £182m the sofa retailer was loaned by Lord Kirkham, its founder, in a buy-out in April by Advent International, the private equity group.Repayment of the vendor loan completes the balance of the more than £300m that Lord Kirkham earned from selling the company to Advent. Lord Kirkham also retained DFS Properties, which owns about a third of the DFS store estate.Advent plans to use some proceeds from the bond issue to pay itself back £60m of its initial £262.5m equity investment in DFS. The issue underlines how debt markets have rebounded, allowing a series of lowly rated companies to sell bonds. This week, DFS said it had appointed Ian Filby, former Alliance Boots executive, as chief executive. Richard Baker, the former chief executive of Boots, was brought in by Advent as chairman of DFS, replacing Lord Kirkham.The bond offer documents show that Lord Kirkham, a miner’s son from Yorkshire, who founded the company 40 years ago in a billiard hall in Doncaster, resigned from DFS in June.They also show that orders taken from May 1 to June 27 decreased slightly, compared with the previous year, due to uncertainty around the General Election and the emergency Budget.Consequently, DFS expects turnover and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the year to July 31 to be lower than in the year to May 1, when it had revenues of £655.7m and adjusted ebitda was £86.5m.This slowdown is attributed to “unusually high sales orders” in the latter half of fiscal 2009, as consumer confidence rebounded, which has not been repeated this year. The weakness of sterling against the dollar is also expected to take its toll.The documents also revealed that DFS spent £449.2m on marketing between July 31 2005 and May 1 2010, including television adverts, making it the second-largest advertiser in the UK retail sector in 2009. This equates to £90m-£96m each year.DFS will meet investors Europewide from Monday to Wednesday. It seeks to raise £240m in secured seven-year bonds. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are to arrange the sale.Junk bond issuance in Europe has been active in the recent weeks, and bankers are expecting a record year. There have been 39 euro-denominated offerings in 2010 with a total value of $23.3bn (£15.2bn), just shy of the record $24bn in year-to-date 2007, according to Thomson Reuters.Gala Coral, the betting and bingo group, also plans to raise up to £600m in its debut bond issue.

As a result, even online-only retailers are trying to find ways to establish some sort of presence on the high street.This week Asos, the online fashion retailer, announced it was in talks with high street retailers including Alliance Boots about a tie-up that would let its customers pick up parcels at their shops.“A lot of people forget that home delivery is not always that convenient if you’re not at home to receive a parcel or you have to miss work to wait at home,” said Tony Stockil, chief executive of Javelin, the e-commerce consultancy that works for most of the top-10 UK retailers.He predicts that by 2020 there will be almost as many web-to-store transactions as store-only purchases, but online sales delivered directly to customers, which are about 7 per cent of all sales, will only reach 14 per cent.When online retail first took off, people suggested a number of ways to avoid the problems of home delivery, from secure boxes outside every house to pick-up points at corner shops. But collecting shopping directly from the retailer has proved to be by far the most popular way of avoiding deliveries. This is one area where bricks and mortar retailers have an advantage over online retailers, who usually benefit from not having the heavy fixed costs of a retail estate.Argos, owned by Home Retail Group, led the way by transferring its telephone ordering business to the internet in 2002 and now almost a quarter of its total sales are made through its click and collect service, compared with 10 per cent ordered online and delivered to customers’ homes.Web-to-store cuts the cost of delivery as retailers can use their existing delivery networks and group parcels together.It also increases in-store sales as once customers are through the doors, they tend to buy more. “There are definitely incremental sales otherwise we wouldn’t be putting the money in,” said Dave Hughes, director of Marks and Spencer Direct, which is still rolling out the service but so far has 13 per cent of online orders picked up in stores.Mr Hughes said it was now expanding into Simply Food stores so shoppers could pick up their lunch at the same time as they collect their orders.John Lewis, which has 20 per cent of its online orders collected in store, is also interested in using its food retailer, Waitrose, as a pick-up point. “We can look to send through Waitrose and explore any other alternatives,” said Simon Russell, head of multi channel at John Lewis.
190;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-06-09T19:50:37Z;Asos in talks to open pick-up service;;Asos, the fast-growing online clothing retailer, has been talking to a number of retailers, including chemist chain Alliance Boots, about allowing customers to collect their orders at Boots stores to avoid the frustration of missed deliveries.The Aim-listed business is trying to find ways of improving its service without having to open stores. Alliance Boots, which is increasingly teaming up with fellow retailers – such as Mothercare and Waitrose – to bring more brands into its stores, is thought to have held informal talks with Asos. Retailers have also suggested that WH Smith and Argos might be in the frame, although Asos has refused to comment on its possible partners.The online retailer disclosed the talks as it reported a 44 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profit. Shares rose almost 15 per cent to close at 725p.“The driver behind this is more and more now the high street retailers are offering in-store pickup, ever since Argos introduced ‘click and collect’,” said Nick Robertson, chief executive.“It’s a proved successful model that attracts higher spending customers . . . the supply chains are geared to deliver single packages to stores so it’s much easier now to piggyback on them.” He said that Asos had been approached by a couple of chains.Mr Robertson said the reliance of online-only retailers on home deliveries had long been seen as a deterrent for some shoppers. He added: “The perceived barrier seems to be dropping away.”“Boots is the sort of retailer who would pursue this – the tie-up with Alliance Unichem was all about being good at distribution and it has entered into more partnerships with Mothercare and Waitrose,” said Kate Calvert, a retail analyst at Shore Capital.Analysts believe the tie-up is likely to be with a retailer that is not a direct competitor but would still benefit from extra footfall from Asos customers who are typically fashion-focused women between the ages of 16 and 34.Analysts also said that WH Smith had been trying to increase footfall in its stores by opening post office concessions.Asos reported that pre-tax profits rose 44 per cent to £20.3m in the year to March 31 and sales increased 35 per cent to £223m.Diluted earnings per share rose 46 per cent to 18.7p. No dividend has been declared as the company is continuing to reinvest cash, partly to fund an extra £20m capital expenditure on a new warehouse this year.The company, which was set up in 2000, said sales in the first nine weeks of the financial year were up 58 per cent, marginally ahead of the growth rate it reported in a trading statement in April.Additional reporting by Adam Jones

Fresh from his involvement in the Harrods sale, Lazard banker Ken Costa did the rounds of the rows of blooms, only glancing at the flowers. His old boss, the late Bruce Wasserstein, a Chelsea regular who hired Mr Costa soon after chatting at the 2007 flower show, was missed.Rose in the aislesSir Stuart Rose strolled the aisles at his last Chelsea show as chief grocer at Marks and Spencer, a day ahead of the final results he will deliver as executive chairman before becoming non-exec chairman.Banker Ian Hart – who was on the M&S team at Citi before he moved to Morgan Stanley last year – was Sir Stuart’s host.New chief executive Marc Bolland was dapper in his new M&S suit, having also prepared his line for his debut at today’s results announcement.Sir Philip Green had returned from Cannes for the evening, while Alliance Boots boss Stefano Pessina completed the high-street retailer top ranks, chatting to Richard Pennycook, Wm Morrison finance director - and former right-hand man to Mr Bolland.PwC green fingersGardening is not in the list of pastimes for J Sainsbury boss Justin King, who was a guest of PricewaterhouseCoopers partner Ian Powell.The accountancy firm is keen to show off its sustainability practice, bought from Leo Johnson, and sponsors a stand at the show with a rainforest and climate change theme.PwC’s sustainability-aware client list at the gala dinner was led by BT boss Ian Livingston and Diageo chief Paul Walsh – not to mention Sir Ian McAllister, the former carmaker who chairs the Carbon Trust.Voltaire meets City at ChelseaThe highlight of the opening day was Jeremy Tigue, F&C director and head of global equities, and colleague Simon Fraser, chairman of F&C Investment Trust, standing by politely as a copper-painted topless model posed in their garden.The hot contenders for “best in show” are main sponsor M&G’s consciously British garden, vying with F&C, whose designer Thomas Hoblyn turned to Candide for inspiration. It includes live performances to bring to life the garden and its many copper casts of parts of the anatomy. At 11.30am poet John Cooper Clarke read excerpts from Candide.Schroders director Bruno Schroder and his partner Suzanne von Maltzahn were on the guest list for the lunch hosted by RHS president and former Lehman banker Giles Coode-Adams.Blues prune backPruning and cutting were the order of the day at Westminster so the usual Tory attendance at the Chelsea opening was cut back due to the important business of government.The contingent of garden-loving Tories at the Monday night opening gala was led by Lord Strathclyde, who is also their leader of the House of Lords. New foreign secretary William Hague usually never misses the networking opportunity but found himself instead occupied by matters of state on his return from Afghanistan.Gardiner gardensThe Royal Horticultural Society’s aptly named new director of horticulture Jim Gardiner was promoted just in time for the show.The magnolia specialist – who is also RHS chief curator – took up the new job only last week. It gives him an ambassadorial role for the organisation, as well as overseeing the RHS plant committees and its plant trials programme.From Artois to arboretumsFormer InBev director and Belgian businessman Philippe de Spoelberch has impeccable credentials as a botanist.The wealthy 69-year-old sits on the RHS council alongside Lord Heseltine, after being invited in 2008.His charitable foundation has donated large sums to botanical causes and he created the 37-acre arboretum, Wespelaar, near Brusssels, featuring rare rhododendrons.He is a member of the family that formerly owned the Artois Brewery, which became part of Interbrew.Mr de Spoelberch studied brewing engineering at the University of Leuven in Belgium and holds an MBA from Columbia University. He became interested in marketing and joined the board in 1977. He was part of the team that successfully positioned Stella Artois in the UK as a luxury brand. Interbrew merged with AmBev in 2004 to create InBev.Mr de Spoelberch handed over his board seat to his nephew Gregoire in 2007.

192;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Hornby earns £2m for nine months work;;Andy Hornby, the former chief executive of HBOS now at the helm of Alliance Boots, was paid more than £2m for nine months work, the pharmacy chain’s annual report revealed on Thursday.Mr Hornby, whose reputation was damaged when HBOS came to the brink of collapse in 2008, received pay and benefits of £1.68m in the year March 31.This included £600,000 in salary, a short-term bonus of £805,000, pension entitlements of £240,000 and benefits of £34,000, making Mr Hornby Alliance Boots’ highest paid director.Mr Hornby also received a £400,000 “golden hello”, as part of his arrangements for joining the group, which was taken private three years ago by executive chairman Stefano Pessina and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in a £12.4bn deal.Mr Hornby, who joined Boots in July last year, will be entitled to a salary of £850,000 this year, the annual report says.Alliance Boots declined to comment. But people familiar with the situation defended the pay package, saying that it was benchmarked against companies in the FTSE 100, and that salaries were below median for these companies excluding oil and financial services. They also pointed to the transparency of the annual report, given that Alliance Boots was a private company.This week Alliance Boots reported underlying profit of more than £1bn in the year to March 31.
193;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Alliance Boots sees healthy leap in profits;;"Alliance Boots, Europe’s biggest pharmacy chain, on Monday said it was looking for partnerships and acquisitions to expand its global footprint, as its trading profit surpassed £1bn ($1.4bn).Stefano Pessina, executive chairman, who took the group private three years ago with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in a £12.4bn deal, said he was particularly keen to move into Latin America.Alliance Boots, which already has a presence in China and Russia, came close to striking a deal in Brazil, he said, but this had come to nothing after due diligence revealed problems with the target. However, the country, along with Mexico, are targets, he said.“We are thinking of many, many different opportunities, and we are exploring a lot of potential partnerships and I have to say some acquisitions,” said Mr Pessina, adding that purchases were more likely to be in the pharmaceutical wholesale market than in retailing.Alliance Boots has invested £1bn since being taken private, primarily revamping its stores. While this investment requirement is coming to an end, Mr Pessina still expects the group to have a “thriving” cash flow to fund his acquisition ambitions.Mr Pessina is also seeking to develop the Boots brands, and recently struck a deal with Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest consumer goods company, to market and distribute an Alliance Boots skincare range to Italian pharmacies.The comments came as Alliance Boots lifted trading profit – profit excluding amortisation and one-time gains or costs – to £1.07bn in the year to March 31 from £953m the previous year. Sales rose 9.6 per cent to £22.5bn.Net debt fell by £645m to £8.39bn, helped by the group taking advantage of market dislocation to buy back debt at a deep discount, from distressed sellers.However, Alliance Boots is cautious on the outlook, amid concerns over European governments’ actions to cut debt, and reduce the consumption of pharmacy products.Andy Hornby, the former chief executive of HBOS who was recruited as Alliance Boots’ chief executive last year, said: “We do think consumer demand will stay quite subdued. The hard truth is the
governments, not just in the UK, but in all of our core European countries, are going to have to take some extremely tough decisions over the next two years.”He refused to say whether Alliance Boots’ results had restored his reputation after HBOS came to the brink of collapse in 2008. “I expect to be judged over time,” he said."
194;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-05-14T00:29:31Z;KKR moves closer to IPO on back of results;;KKR took a step closer to a New York flotation as the private equity group reported a profit of $674.8m for the first quarter, in what is likely to be its last set of results before the planned share sale.After almost three years of attempts to go public, KKR filed plans in March to list in the US in a move that would give it a market capitalisation of $7bn and allow it to match Blackstone, its biggest rival.Rising equity and debt markets in the first quarter helped most private equity groups to benefit from a pick-up in dealmaking activity and the rising value of their investment portfolios.KKR said it had made economic net income – a measure of profitability that includes fees earned, profits and losses on investments and the costs of running the business – of $674.8m, up from $2.5m in the same period a year ago, and a rise of 31 per cent on the fourth quarter.Blackstone last month reported first-quarter economic net income of $360m.As a pioneer of leveraged buy-outs, KKR shot to fame 20 years ago with its $30bn takeover of RJR Nabisco, immortalised in the book Barbarians at the Gate. It has conducted some of the biggest LBOs, including the $48bn takeover of TXU, the Texas power group, and the £11bn ($16bn) buy-out of Alliance Boots, the UK pharmacy chain.Its New York flotation plan is part of a broader strategy to diversify into new areas, such as capital markets and debt investing, reducing its reliance on the cyclical buy-out business.KKR recently filed plans to raise an extra $500m through a primary issue of shares once its flotation in New York is complete. The extra funds would be invested in fresh areas and in supporting new funds and businesses.In the first quarter, there were early signs of this strategy bearing fruit, as KKR’s capital markets business completed some lucrative mandates, earning a record $24.6m of transaction fees, up from $19.6m in the previous quarter.The capital markets business advised KKR’s own buy-out team on acquiring Pets at Home, the UK pet accessories chain, and the sale of shares in chipmaker Avago. It also advised Manchester United football club on a bond issue.More lucrative mandates could be on the way, as KKR is lining up several of its biggest portfolio companies for initial public offerings, including HCA, the hospital group, NXP, the chipmaker, and Toys R Us, the retailer.KKR said its total fees were $187.3m in the first quarter, an increase of 46 per cent from a year ago, but down slightly from the fourth quarter.The group wrote up the value of its investment portfolio by about 10 per cent to $29.6bn during the first three months of the year. Its assets under management rose by 5 per cent to $54.7bn.
195;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-05-12T19:57:57Z;M&S moves to reduce pension shortfall;;Marks and Spencer is to put £800m ($1.2bn) into its pension scheme after a review found it had a yawning deficit, but the retailer insisted on Wednesday that it had no plans to close the final salary scheme to existing members.M&S’s triennial valuation found that the retailer’s deficit stood at £1.3bn in March 2009. To stem the shortfall M&S is putting cash into the fund over the coming eight years plus an immediate injection of property.It will put £35m of cash into the fund each year for the next three years, increasing that amount to £60m a year until 2018.M&S is also putting £300m value in property in a partnership with the fund while providing a further £124m by transferring assets from US debt hedge contracts.The retailer, which has 123,000 pension fund members, will have a £500m funding shortfall, according to the latest valuation. But the company said it was not a problem given that the markets have rebounded since that valuation was carried out.“The £500m difference between the valuation deficit and the funding plan is expected to be met by investment returns on the pension scheme’s existing assets,” M&S said.The clothing and food chain, which has 20,000 current members in its defined benefits scheme, said it would not be following the growing band of companies – such as Alliance Boots, Wm Morrison and Vodafone – which are closing the final salary schemes to existing members.It closed the scheme to new members in 2002.Analysts expressed relief that M&S did not have to launch a rights issue or put bigger sums of cash into the pot in the short term.However, Credit Suisse warned that the £1.3bn deficit was larger than it had expected, pointing out that the fund was only £600m in the red at the last valuation in 2006.“There may be some relief here that the huge deficit has not resulted in a more punitive funding requirement,” it said.“One is left with the impressions, however, that this is just the next phase in this saga (next valuation due as at March 2012) and that the attempt to cover off the liability is to a significant extent being deferred rather than addressed to protect short-term cash flows.”M&S shares rose 6.7p to 351.3p.
196;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-05-08T00:41:16Z;Alliance Boots and P&G seal skincare tie-up;;Alliance Boots has struck a deal with Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest consumer goods company, to help expand its nascent skincare business in Europe.In an unusual tie-up, P&G has agreed to market and distribute Alliance Boot’s Laboratories Serum 7 skincare range to Italian pharmacy chains.It puts the firepower of P&G’s distribution network and marketing expertise behind Alliance Boots’ products while giving the maker of Olay a more exclusive skincare brand to sell through its established Italian network.“On the continent, we needed a portfolio brand,” said Gianni Ciserani, president of P&G Western Europe. “It doesn’t work to sell mass market brands in pharmacies. We have capacity and know-how but what was missing was the brand.”Neither party would comment on the financial details of the deal, which will be announced on Saturday. The brand will remain wholly owned by Alliance Boots.Stefano Pessina, Alliance Boot’s chairman and co-owner alongside Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, has made no secret of his desire to develop a “third leg” to Alliance Boots’ business. With a £7.15bn ($10.6bn) retail business and a £11.3bn wholesale arm, Mr Pessina’s final piece of the triumvirate is to elevate Boots’ brands – Laboratories skincare range, Soltan suncare, Botanics – into a substantial business of its own.“We will do this joint venture to facilitate the expansion of our brand,” said Mr Pessina, declining to say whether he would roll-out the tie-up to other markets in Europe or beyond.“In other markets we could go with a retail chain or pharmacy chain in the US or a local distributer. It is very difficult to tell you what we do in the next three to four years, we want to go global with skincare and we will use all different opportunities that we can find.”Alliance Boots has been striking up similar deals in recent years. In the US, Target, the mass discounter, and CVS, one of the country’s biggest drugstore chains, also have deals in place to sell Boots’ cosmetics and skincare lines.P&G, meanwhile, is increasingly looking for these sorts of deals as part of its “connect and develop” strategy designed to find new ideas and business opportunities. It has already set up a joint venture with the Swiss owners of the Clearblue brand to distribute its pregnancy tests globally. It also entered a partnership with an Italian professor to access technology to enable it to print text and images on Pringles potato crisps.Alliance Boots, which will deliver annual results on May 17, is already selling the Boots Laboratories skincare range in France and Portugal with plans for a Spanish roll-out this year.The retailer and drug distributor, taken private in Europe’s biggest buy-out three years ago, is poised to report another year of double-digit profit growth driven by a strong performance in its wholesale business.Alliance Boots is expected to make a profit of more than £1bn (£953m) in the year to March.
197;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;KKR to buy 49.9% stake in Grupo Inaer;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US private equity group, announced the purchase of a large stake in Grupo Inaer, the Spanish helicopter operator, from Italy’s Investindustrial in a deal valuing the company at about €700m ($924m).The move is the latest sign of how KKR – which backed some of the biggest “mega buy-outs” of the credit bubble, including the £11bn ($17bn) buy-out of the UK pharmacy chain Alliance Boots– has started doing smaller deals, often buying a minority stake.KKR has agreed to buy a 49.9 per cent stake in Inaer. Its Italian private equity rival and the company’s managers will have 50.1 per cent of the group that provides helicopters for emergency services, fire-fighting, search and rescue, surveillance and off-shore oil and gas facilities.Inaer, which is based in Alicante on the east coast of Spain, operates 281 helicopters. It employs 1,700 staff at bases in Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, the UK and Chile.KKR and its Italian partner plan to expand the business into new countries, such as northern and eastern Europe, through acquisitions and organic growth.“This company has long-term contracts with municipalities that are five to 10 years long,” said Johannes Huth, head of KKR in Europe. “It has a utility-like nature through these long-term contracts.”Investindustrial, one of Italy’s biggest private equity groups with €2.1bn of assets under management, bought a 75 per cent stake in Grupo Inaer for €205m in 2005.Since then, the company’s revenues have been multiplied by 2.4 to more than €300m and its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation have more than trebled to reach an expected €85m this year.Andrea Bonomi, chairman of Investindustrial, said: “There comes a point where, as a southern European private equity group, we cannot take it any further, so we decided to look for a partner with a global footprint to take it forward.”The deal is the sixth by KKR’s new $6.3bn European buy-out fund, which it raised last year. In many of these deals, KKR has invested alongside a partner, often without taking a majority stake or having outright control.KKR joined forces with Triton last month in its German rival’s €850m acquisition of Ambea, the Nordic hospitals operator. Last year, KKR agreed to invest €250m into a new music publishing joint venture with Germany’s Bertelsmann.In February it sealed the £950m buy-out of Pets at Home, the UK pet accessories chain, and made a pre-IPO investment of several hundred million euros for a 35 per cent stake in the flavours business of Rudolf Wild, a German food company.
198;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Alliance Boots chief in push for third unit;Plan to elevate brands into substantial business;Billionaires with private jets do not normally get held up while globe-trotting, but even the usually unstoppable Stefano Pessina was marooned in Italy last week, his trip to Alliance Boots’ headquarters in London thwarted by the Icelandic volcanic ash.The executive chairman of Europe’s largest pharmacy chain by stores had been due to fly into London from China via Zurich before the ash cloud scuppered him.“I had to find another way,” he says, his face beamed into the Alliance Boots’ boardroom in central London from his base in Lavagna. “I went to Dubai and then to Turkey. I was lucky enough to go to Nice because it was one of the few airports that was open.“I was preparing myself for a good night of sleep from Hong Kong to Zurich for 13½ hours and in the end I had a more complicated way back.”Fortunately, he was able to charter his private jet for the Dubai leg of the journey, otherwise he would have probably not made it back at all.But the travel stress and sleep disruption has barely ruffled the workaholic who invested £1.27bn of his personal fortune taking Alliance Boots private in a £12.4bn deal three years ago. “We were lucky that it was during the weekend, and so we didn’t have a substantial disruption in our job,” he says, without a hint of irony.It is a particularly busy time for the Italian entrepreneur. Next month, Mr Pessina will present Alliance Boots’ third set of annual results under private ownership, flanked by KKR, his partner private equity house.It has been, says Mr Pessina, “a very good year”. Trading profit across the group, which consists of the health and beauty division of retail stores and chemists and a wholesale business that sells medicines to more than 140,000 doctors, pharmacies and hospitals across 20 countries, has edged past the 11.6 per cent growth of last year. That means trading profits will tip past the £1bn mark, having stood at £953m in the year to March 2009.It has been the wholesale division, which last year struggled as the regulatory environments moved against Alliance Boots, that has delivered the “fantastic” performance. “The growth [in trading profit] is higher than 10 per cent, higher even than 15 per cent.”His retail business, which includes 3,200 stores across the UK and another 450 pharmacies in 20 countries, had also fared well after substantial investment – Alliance Boots has to date invested £1bn of capital across the group – into refurbishing and rebranding the Alliance UniChem pharmacy chains to the Boots banner.Three years on from one of the biggest leverage buy-outs in history, and Mr Pessina reiterates that he and KKR are pursuing a long-term growth path rather than trying to turn a quick buck.Neither he nor KKR will be taking a dividend until it has paid down most of the debt: net borrowings were whittled down by £500m to about £8.5bn in the year just gone.Operationally, Mr Pessina hired Andy Hornby, former chief executive of HBOS and an Asda veteran, as his chief executive to free him for thinking time.“I like to think about the future of the company,” says the entrepreneur who trained as a nuclear engineer before joining his family’s drug wholesale business.“This is what I like to do and this is now my main job. And so I’m left to cover it a little more, in reality, to go around and see where we can expand our company in the future and in which way.”The entrepreneur, who orchestrated the creation of Alliance Boots back in 2006 through the merger of his Alliance UniChem business with Boots, has plenty more ambition.His next project is to develop a “third leg” to Alliance Boots’ business. With a £7.15bn retail business and a £11.3bn wholesale arm, Mr Pessina’s final piece of the triumvirate is to elevate Boots’ brands – Laboratories skincare range, Soltan suncare, Botanics – into a substantial business in their own right. He is now looking at partnership deals to distribute Boots Laboratories skincare range beyond France and Portugal to more countries in Europe.“We have to find a local distributor or we have to find an agreement with big retailers, or we have to find an agreement with people who have the ability to sell these products,” he explains. “It will be more complicated to do it because we have to rely more and more on other people.”Last year, Boots struck a deal with Waitrose to sell each other’s products.But in the coming year Mr Pessina will be racking up many more airmiles as he scours Europe and beyond in an effort to notch up those partnerships. “The brand will be something that is really important over a long period,” he insists. “It will lead to a new dimension.”
199;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-04-22T19:58:37Z;Founder of DFS set for £300m from sale;;Lord Kirkham, the founder and chairman of DFS, is set to make more than £300m ($462m) from the £500m sale of the sofa retailer to Advent International, the private equity group.The deal, confirmed on Thursday, will see Richard Baker, the former chief executive of Alliance Boots and an operating partner at Advent, succeed Lord Kirkham as DFS chairman.Under the terms of the deal, which have not been disclosed, it is believed that Lord Kirkham, who said last month he would not sell because he was “loaded”, is disposing of DFS Furniture, the operating company of the sofa retailer. He is retaining DFS Properties, which owns about a third of the DFS store estate.Although the holding company for DFS has about £330m of debt, the net debt in the operating company is thought to be less than £100m, leaving Lord Kirkham with a substantial profit.It is the second time that Lord Kirkham, a miner’s son from Yorkshire, has cashed in on the company he founded 40 years ago in a billiard hall in Doncaster.He and his family are estimated to have made more than £400m from floating the business in 1993 and progressively disposing of their stake when it was a listed company. Lord Kirkham used some of the proceeds of the float to buy Gainsborough’s “Peasants Going to Market”.Six years ago, he took the company private again for £507m, after an acrimonious battle with shareholders who accused him of trying to buy it back on the cheap.He received an £11.3m bonus from the company last year and in 2007 paid himself a £46m dividend.As well as continuing to own the property company, Lord Kirkham is expected to retain a significant financial interest in DFS through a vendor loan to Advent. It is funding the deal with equity, and will look to refinance the business at a later date to pay off the vendor loan.Lord Kirkham is expected to gradually exit the running of the business after handing over to Mr Baker, who he has known for a couple of years.Advent plans to add to the estate, opening six to eight shops a year, and could move into Ireland.However, some long-term observers of the business were sceptical about its prospects without Lord Kirkham at the helm.He was advised by Goldman Sachs, and Alan Jacobs, his long-time financial adviser.

200;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-04-20T22:24:17Z;Aviva to close final salary scheme;;Aviva plans to become the latest large UK company to close its final salary pension scheme to existing members, prompting the Unite union to accuse the insurer of “stabbing employees in the back”.Aviva said on Tuesday it would consult employees, scheme trustees and the union about its plans, which would see member benefits frozen at current levels and employees offered membership of a defined contribution scheme.Most FTSE 100 companies have closed their defined benefit pension schemes to new members to combat the volatility such liabilities bring to their balance sheets. However, a handful of the UK’s largest companies – including Barclays, Alliance Boots and Vodafone – have also closed schemes to existing members.Mark Hodges, chief executive of Aviva in the UK, said the plan would protect the final salary benefits employees had built up.“It would provide a competitive alternative for them and simultaneously reduce the volatile impact of the final salary pension deficit on our business in the long-term,” he said.Bernadette Fisher, Unite officer for Aviva, said: “As the UK’s biggest pension provider, it is quite shocking that Aviva should be looking to plunge thousands of their own staff into pensions’ insecurity at this difficult time.”The proposals cover Aviva’s final salary scheme, which has about 7,600 members, and the much smaller RAC final salary scheme.
201;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-04-07T21:29:44Z;AA patrols vote for first strike in its history;;AA patrolmen have voted to stage the first strike in the vehicle breakdown recovery service’s 105-year history, in protest at the company’s plans to restructure its final salary pension scheme.The Independent Democratic Union said 57 per cent of the ballots received from 87 per cent of its 2,400 AA members by the deadline were in favour of striking.It said a decision about whether to strike would depend on the company’s response.The AA said it was “disappointed” and pointed out that it was keeping its final salary pension scheme open, while many similar schemes had been closed. It said “contingency plans would be in place to ensure a good breakdown service for members”.Three years ago the private equity owners of the AA were dragged into a heated spat with unions about job cuts that ended with buy-out bosses being called before a parliamentary inquiry into their industry.In advance of the election, the IDU may intend to apply political pressure to the AA and its private equity owners, Permira, CVC and Charterhouse.The AA has proposed capping pensionable salary increases in its pension scheme at 2.5 per cent, up from its initial offer of a 1 per cent cap.It also offered to increase its contributions from £13m to £18m to clear a deficit that stood at £190m in November 2009.The decision to restructure the AA’s defined benefit pension scheme comes after similar schemes have been closed to existing members by some of the UK’s biggest companies, including Barclays, Alliance Boots and Vodafone.However, unions suspect the AA is trying to cut costs as Acromas, its parent, prepares for a possible initial public offering, which would make it an FTSE 100 company with a value of as much as £10bn.“There is a cynical view among our guys that this is just a move by private equity to polish the company up a bit before the ‘for sale’ sign goes up,” said Ian Allen, national president of the IDU.Andrew Strong, AA chief executive, said: “The union are out of touch with the real world on this issue. The AA is bucking the trend by proposing to keep our final salary section and career average sections open when most companies are closing theirs.”The AA said the IDU was “jumping the gun” by holding a strike ballot before the consultation period ends on April 23.Permira and CVC bought the AA in 2004 for £1.7bn and cut 3,500 jobs, sparking the union backlash.In 2007 they merged the AA with Saga, the travel and insurance provider to the over-50s, to form Acromas.The private equity groups declined to comment.However, people familiar with the situation denied Acromas was planning a flotation this year.Default lineAcademic research has dismissed the notion that companies are more likely to go bust if they are owned by private equity, writes Martin Arnold.An industry-sponsored study found failure rates for private equity deals since 2003 no higher than for other companies.That provides a boost for private equity’s push to persuade regulators that it is not a risky form of ownership, as it wrestles with proposals for a regulatory clampdown on the industry in Brussels and Washington.A study of 7.8m company accounts filed between 1995 and 2009, for which insolvency occurred at 140,000 companies, found that recovery rates for creditors were twice as high from insolvencies of private equity-owned companies than from others.The research was carried out by the Credit Management Research Centre at Leeds University Business School, the Centre for Management Buy-out Research at Nottingham University and the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Centre at the University of Birmingham Business School.The study said: “At this juncture, having encompassed a substantial part of the current recessionary period, we do not find support for the view that higher failure rates due to higher leverage are a specific feature of private equity-backed buy-outs”.Sponsored by the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, it also found that management buy-out deals were less likely to fail when backed by a private equity group.It said: “Our finding is suggestive of active involvement by PE firms helping portfolio companies deal better and more timely with trading difficulties, particularly in the more recent period leading up to the credit crunch”.
202;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-04-02T18:33:52Z;Labour on back foot over NI rise;;Labour cabinet ministers were forced on Friday to defend next year’s rise in national insurance in the face of growing criticism from business leaders, and said the Tories would struggle to fund their £5bn plan to reverse part of the rise.A letter supporting the Conservative policy publicly backed by 38 business leaders and six business groups was published this week in a move which threatened to derail relations between Labour and the business world.The growing coalition opposed to Labour’s policy now includes the CBI employers’ organisation, the Institute of Directors and the British Chambers of Commerce, as well as businessmen Sir Stuart Rose, executive chairman of Marks and Spencer, Ian Cheshire, chief executive of Kingfisher, and Simon Fox, chief executive of HMV. They were joined last night by Stefano Pessina, chairman of Alliance Boots.While eight are Tory party donors, the list also includes business figures who, until now, have been largely uncritical of the government, a fact prompting acute concerns within the highest echelons of Labour. Some of the signatories have even sat on government business panels.Ed Balls, education secretary and a key ally of the prime minister, on Friday attacked the Tories’ NI announcement as a “panicky lurch in tax policy”. In an article for Tribune, the left-leaning magazine, he said: “A tax freeze on this scale can only be paid for by drastic cuts to frontline services or by unfair rises in other taxes like VAT.”Labour figures are privately furious to have been ambushed on such an important tax issue by many of the biggest names in corporate Britain just days before the general election is called. They have also been rattled by criticism from their own ranks after Lord Desai, Labour peer and economist, said “at the margins” the tax rise would affect job creation or job retention.David Cameron, Tory leader, said on Friday his pledge to reverse half of next year’s 1 per cent rise in national insurance was right as it was a “tax on jobs” that hit people earning £20,000 or above. He said: “I don’t think people earning £20,000 are rich. Labour apparently does.”He added: “Who do you believe? Business leaders who run some of Britain’s biggest and best businesses, who every week, every month, every year have to get rid of unnecessary costs [and] provide a good service …Or Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown, who doubled the national debt?”Within Labour there are concerns the party has been made to seem an enemy of business and incredulity the Tories appeared to have back-pedalled on their previous argument that cutting the deficit was the main duty of the next government.Reversing part of the NI increase will cost about £5bn, to be funded through “efficiency savings” – despite Mr Cameron’s 2008 claim that efficiency drives were “one of the oldest tricks in the book”.Lord Sugar, Labour’s enterprise tsar, meanwhile, compared business leaders to greedy schoolchildren. “Ask every kid at school, would they like an iPod, they would say yes, with no regard who is paying for it,” he said.
203;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-03-26T18:05:13Z;KKR to partner with Triton in Ambea acquisition;;KKR, the US private equity group, will next week step forward as a surprise partner for Triton in the German buy-out firm’s €850m acquisition of Ambea, the Nordic hospitals and nursing homes operator.Triton last month announced its acquisition of Ambea from 3i, the UK private equity group, without referring to a potential partnership with KKR on the deal.KKR, which already owns the HCA hospital group in the US and the Alliance Boots pharmacies in the UK, has been tracking Ambea since late last year.While the US private equity group did not bid in the recent auction of Ambea, judging that others were better placed, it held talks with Triton for several weeks about a potential partnership. KKR declined to comment.The deal is expected to be financed with about €400m-€450m of bank debt. It is the latest sign of how KKR – which backed some of the biggest “mega buy-outs” of the credit bubble – has started doing smaller deals.Last month it sealed the £950m buy-out of Pets at Home, the UK pet accessories chain, and made a pre-IPO investment of several hundred million euros for a 35 per cent stake in the flavours business of Rudolf Wild, a German food company.It also agreed to invest €250m into a new music publishing joint venture with Germany’s Bertelsmann last year.3i created Ambea in 2005 by buying Carema, the Swedish care homes operator, and expanding through the purchase of Finland’s Mehiläinen in 2006 and 20 add-on deals.The Swedish-based company generated annual sales of SKr7.3bn ($1bn) and earnings before interest, tax and amortisation of SKr624m.Frankfurt-based Triton raised €2.25bn ($3bn) for its third buy-out fund last year, outstripping both its previous €750m fund and its €1.9bn target for the new fund. However, the Ambea deal proved too big for it to do by itself.
204;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;A history lesson for Kraft’s leaders;The story of Boots has warnings for foreign acquirers;Marc Firestone, executive vice-president for corporate and legal affairs at the US food company Kraft, has a date today with the House of Commons business, innovation and skills select committee. It is unlikely to be a comfortable experience. Mr Firestone will be representing the giant company that has gobbled up Cadbury, the venerable British confectioner. The possibilities for grandstanding by the committee’s MPs are virtually unlimited.If he can get hold of a radio before 9am, Mr Firestone might want to tune in to BBC Radio 4, to catch the last in the current series of a programme called The Long View. (He should not be put off by the fact that this columnist appears briefly in it.) The programme, which is also available on the BBC’s website, contains a thought-provoking commentary on the Kraft/Cadbury takeover, informed by a comparative study of a previous American takeover of another cherished British asset, Boots the Chemist, in 1920.You didn’t know that Boots was once in American hands? Well, it was. Ninety years ago Jesse Boot, the son of the founder, sought a buyer for the business, troubled as he was by severe ill health and profound nervousness about his son’s ability to take over the running of the company. He sold out to Louis Liggett’s United Drug Co. for about £2.25m – £80m in today’s money.Staff and shareholders were angry about the sale. Press coverage – including that of the Financial Times – was unfavourable. There was scepticism about what the “alien manufacture” of drugs and remedies might mean for British consumers. And Boots’s main UK rival, Taylors of Leeds, began proclaiming loudly that it was, by way of contrast, “the largest British chemists” in its advertising material.Worried about the increasing Americanisation of the company (in terms of management style and products), Jesse Boot’s son John, who had remained on the board, persuaded Liggett to sell 25 per cent of Boots shares back to UK investors in 1923.Ten years later the cash-strapped Americans were forced to sell out, and Boots was returned to British ownership. From the early 1930s on, the company built on its reputation as a progressive employer and successful business.Kraft’s management will reject any alleged parallels between the crude intervention of the United Drug Co. into British corporate life, and its successful acquisition of Cadbury 90 years later. It is highly unlikely, for example, that a new cohort of British institutions could be dragooned into buying the company back. Indeed, by September 2009, only 28 per cent of Cadbury shares were even owned by UK institutions. US institutions already owned nearly half the shares. Clearly, its destiny would be decided beyond these shores.Not only that, but the overwhelming majority of Cadbury employees are based outside the UK. Other markets, for example the fast-growing economies of Asia, are more important revenue-generators for the company than the home market. How British, Kraft could ask, was Cadbury, really?But the Boots story does contain several important warnings to any foreign acquirer of a much-loved business. Brands, and company identities, are valuable but also delicate things. They can be damaged very easily, by accident or by design. It was unwise, to put it mildly, for Kraft to suggest that a threatened Cadbury plant near Bristol was possibly going to be saved if the Kraft takeover went through, only to confirm the plant’s closure once the deal was done.Even if it had been diluted over time, some of the original Cadbury ethos – “caring capitalism”, as it has been labelled – survived. The company was committed to buying only Fairtrade cocoa. That has not, until now, been the Kraft way.But if the new American owners are careless about the Cadbury legacy, the commercial damage could be severe. Shoppers, plugged in to social networking media on a global scale, can switch loyalty fast if they feel that once trustworthy products have been in some way diminished.Maybe it is true that “the market has no memory”. But customers and employees do. The wise victor of a takeover battle shows humility, tact and appropriate respect for the acquired business. History teaches us that the companies that fail to do this come unstuck pretty fast. So business leaders should study some history. As the philosopher George Santayana put it: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”stefan.stern@ft.comFor more go to www.ft.com/managementblog
205;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-03-12T20:40:30Z;Why there could be more deals ahead;;One word you don’t hear any more is de-equitisation. This ungainly tag was used five years ago to describe a shrinking in the number of shares in issue because of the boom in debt-funded acquisitions and share buybacks.But might that be about to change? It is certainly a question worth posing after a flurry of merger and acquisitions activity – both real and imagined – during the past couple of weeks. An approach for UK Coal, a bid for Tullett Prebon, the interdealer broker, Prudential’s $35.5bn move for the Asian assets of AIG, rumours of a News Corp bid for BSkyB and Friday an offer for Liberty, owner of the iconic London department store. This is just some of the newsflow that has been keeping traders on their toes.There are reasons for thinking there could be more deals on the horizon in the UK, and not just because equity markets continue to grind higher. One is that debt funding is as cheap as equity funding again. For example, the yield on seven- to 10-year triple B rated corporate bonds is about 6 per cent – the same as the free cashflow yield of European companies.When debt funding was cheaper than equity funding back in 2003, it provided the “foundation for a behavioural change across financial markets”, according to Citigroup’s Jonathan Stubbs. Private equity became a real force as leveraged buy-outs got bigger and bigger, culminating with the £11bn acquisition of Alliance Boots by KKR and Stefano Pessina in 2007. Corporates also joined in the fun and the debt-equity arbitrage was the underpinning for three to four years of shrinking equity markets, says Mr Stubbs.It would, of course, be wrong to expect a return to those boom times. There is no longer a level playing field in as much as banks are unwilling to back highly leveraged buy-outs. This was illustrated last week when Carlyle was unable to come up with an offer for Shanks Group that the board of the waste management group felt it was able to recommend because of financing constraints.But for the chief executive of a big company with a strong balance sheet, funding is available – probably at closer to 5 per cent than 6 per cent. They should at least be considering the advantages of using relatively cheap debt to snap up competitors. As tourists to these shores will testify, there are few better places for them to go shopping than the UK.First of all, overseas buyers get the benefit of the weak pound, which has devalued against most currencies this year. This makes it cheaper to buy British. Analysts believe one of the reasons behind the £285m bid by a US rival for Delta, a maker of steel road safety barriers and power transmission poles, is the dollar/sterling exchange rate. And there are many other UK engineering companies, such as Weir, Bodycote and Chloride, with strong positions in niche markets that could be vulnerable to a bid if sterling remains weak.Second, it is easier to buy in the UK than many other countries around the world, although it is worth noting that Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, would like to make it more difficult. Finally, many UK companies have strong international footprints, which are attractive to rivals looking to expand into faster growing markets. One of the reasons Kraft paid £11.6bn for Cadbury was its emerging markets footprint. Citi reckons there are two dozen companies in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 that do more than a quarter of their business in emerging markets and also boast strong balance sheets.All that said, M&A (and de-equitisation) is unlikely to make a real comeback until executives and shareholders have greater confidence in the economic outlook and the scars from 2009 have healed. Until they do, and fears of a double-dip recession fade, company bosses will be reluctant to undertake big deals and investors will be reluctant to back them – as Prudential’s Tidjane Thiam may yet find out given the size of the deal he is proposing. All that is perfectly understandable. But for the bold and brave who can get shareholders on side there are opportunities, and the betting must be that some of them are taken in the months ahead.

207;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-03-12T19:27:50Z;KKR files plans for $2.2bn float;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is heading for a $2.2bn flotation in New York, taking advantage of the recovery in financial markets to launch a share sale that is likely to make multibillion-dollar fortunes on paper for founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts.After almost three years of frustrated attempts to go public, the private equity group filed plans on Friday to list in the US.The listing would give KKR a market capitalisation of $7.5bn. It would allow the group, which was founded in 1976, to match its biggest rival Blackstone, which completed its initial public offering in 2007.As a pioneer of leveraged buy-outs, KKR shot to fame 20 years ago with its $30bn takeover of RJR Nabisco, immortalised in the book Barbarians at the Gate.It has done some of the biggest LBOs, including the record $48bn takeover of Texas power company TXU and the £11bn ($17bn) buy-out of UK pharmacy chain Alliance Boots.KKR said that it would offer stock worth about $2.2bn, equivalent to 30 per cent of its overall share capital. The group’s principals, led by Mr Kravis and Mr Roberts, would own the rest of the shares and keep tight control of the business.The New York-listed shares in KKR would be exchanged on a one-for-one basis with those of its KKR Guernsey vehicle, which was created last year by the private equity group’s merger with its Amsterdam-listed permanent capital fund.In common with many of its rivals, KKR’s fortunes have rebounded with financial markets. Shares in its Amsterdam-listed unit have risen more than fivefold in the last year.KKR has $2bn of debt, giving it an enterprise value – equity plus net debt – of about $9.5bn.In the filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, KKR said Mr Kravis and Mr Roberts would maintain control over the group’s managing partner via a combined majority of the A shares, allowing them to choose board members.Shares in KKR Guernsey rose 4.8 per cent to $11.65 on Friday, up from a 52-week low of $1.93 in the depths of the financial crisis.The group said its assets under management had grown from $15.1bn in 2004 to $52.2bn last year, underlining the explosive growth in private equity before the credit crisis started.Reporting last month its first results as a public company, KKR said it had made net economic income of $515.3m for the fourth quarter and $1.95bn for the year.
208;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-02-19T19:06:16Z;Kevin Goldstein-Jackson: Picking up the private-equity pieces;Forced sales mean takeover opportunities;"Ilamented the many years of poor leadership and performance at EMI in this column three years ago. I commented: “Will a private-equity firm acquire EMI and split it in two and make lots of money? Or will it overpay, borrow too much – and cut the artist roster even further until sales are so low that any takeover by a major record company would be unlikely to attract regulatory opposition?”Then, in the summer of 2007, EMI was acquired by Terra Firma, the private equity group led by Guy Hands. In the FT on February 15 this year, Hands admitted that EMI is worth £2bn less than the £4.2bn purchase price and Terra Firma is now in dispute with Citigroup regarding the purchase and financing.So how many more private-equity deals are facing problems? I ask this as forced sales could be good news for companies that can pick up the pieces at knock-down prices.One company that could be looking for takeover opportunities is Reckitt Benckiser. I remember writing in September 2003 that Reckitt’s results had made me rummage through my kitchen, bathroom and utility room cupboards. The health and personal care group had reported such strong cash flow that it was proposing to increase dividends and share buy-backs – but its “first preference” was to “reinvest its financial resources” in “value-adding acquisitions”.My cupboard searching led me to packets of Nurofen and Strepsils that I knew were made by Crookes Healthcare, a subsidiary of Boots.Although Boots sold its healthcare products in more than 130 countries, the company had stated it intended to focus its marketing on “the 10 largest markets”.I wrote: “Imagine the possibilities if Reckitt could be persuaded to do a deal with Boots, as Reckitt’s marketing expertise …is considerable.”Some time later, with no deal in the offing, I concluded that Boots should have spun off its healthcare business as a separate company, giving existing Boots shareholders stakes in both.Then, in 2006, Boots finally did sell its healthcare business to Reckitt for £1.93bn, and merged with Alliance UniChem to form Alliance Boots, which was later taken private.On February 10 this year, Reckitt Benckiser reported 2009 pre-tax profits of £1.89bn – up 28 per cent on the previous year. Reckitt now has net cash of £220m and the financial firepower to pay perhaps £1bn or more for suitable acquisitions. What will it buy? Will it enter new areas of activity? Or will it expand its drugs business to offset the likely drop in sales of its Suboxone prescription drug for opiate dependency?I am hoping for more takeovers, led by people who can extract the best value for shareholders.Meanwhile, I am not unduly concerned by reports earlier this month of Argentina preventing a ship from loading oil-rig pipes destined for an area “illegally occupied” by
the UK: the Falkland Islands.Although my self-invested personal pension (Sipp) has shares in Falkland Islands Holdings and Westmount Energy – both of which own stakes in companies about to drill for oil in that region – I think the Argentine government would be better off persuading an Argentine company to buy stakes in those companies.This would be much cheaper (and much less painful) than “gunboat diplomacy” – especially as British governments appear to allow foreign investors to “occupy” almost any British company.Kevin Goldstein-Jackson is an active investor writing about his own investments. He may have a financial interest in any of the companies and trading strategies mentioned."
209;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-02-11T16:55:20Z;Aim gains first 2010 member, but don’t expect a rush;;Oxford Nutrascience Group will on Friday enjoy the distinction of becoming the first new company to join Aim this year.It is good news that the duck has finally been broken. But the London Stock Exchange statistics for January show no sign of a decline in the number of companies leaving the junior market.A further 19 companies quit Aim last month, compared with 21 in January 2009. The departees include seven that have been taken over, including Cybit, the telematics group bought by a US technology fund. Others, such as Vision Media Group, have gone into administration or been wound up.The trend has continued this month, with cash shells such as White Star Energy quitting because they have failed to make a deal in the requisite time. Payzone, the ATM group formed when Alphyra reversed into Cardpoint in 2007, will leave the market on completion of a restructuring deal that is in effect a pre-pack administration, leaving shareholders with nothing.This column has argued that the continued shrinkage of the long tail of micro-caps is good for Aim, which should be left with a core of stronger, bigger companies. Which brings us back to Oxford Nutrascience.The company may be the first Aim IPO this year, but it can only be termed a micro-cap. It has raised just £890,000 net at 1.75p a share, giving it a market capitalisation of £8.1m.Founded a couple of years ago, it specialises in making medicines more palatable. It raised £1m through private investors and Ora Capital Partners, the Aim-quoted venture led by Richard Griffiths, founder of Evolution Securities.It acquired a patented chocolate flavoured calcium chew, on sale through Alliance Boots, where Nigel Theobald, chief executive, spent 13 years. Mr Theobald argues that the flotation will raise Oxford Nutrascience’s profile.In the eight months to August 31 the company, which is advised by ZAI Corporate Finance, made an operating loss of £174,000 on revenues of £36,000. However, it is developing further products, including multi-vitamin chews.Mr Theobald believes that prospects are exciting, the management team is strong and that raising funds will not pose problems. “It’s a good story we’re are bringing to investors.”Aim should be just the ticket for a growing UK company with a technical twist. But this one looks too small to spark the hoped-for surge in IPOs.Overseas newbiesThere are others lining up, including two from overseas. Teliti International, a Malaysian IT services company, is planning to raise £12m to build a data centre. Red Lambda, a Florida-based maker of software to prevent unauthorised online file-sharing, is hoping to raise £5m to increase its sales team and fund international expansion.Some will take such news as positive for the market. But it dismays Ian Spence, the veteran technology analyst who publishes Megabuyte. “Oh no, not again!” is his cry.Mr Spence argues that Asian and US companies joining Aim “is almost always a bad idea. In the case of US companies, investors will [rightly] question why a company would need to look outside the most active private equity market in the world to seek capital. More often than not there is a simple reason – the companies aren’t any good”.In the case of Asian companies, the reason is different, but no less compelling, he believes. As they have little or no business in Europe, let alone the UK, it is difficult to get a real perspective on the quality of the companies. Therefore, “UK investors are usually far behind local investors in the information flow from the company so, when things go wrong, the share price has already moved before London investors have time to react”.For investors who lament the lack of independent research into small companies, such a blast comes like a shot in the arm. But the nomads (nominated advisers) looking for companies to bring to market will all be wincing.Time to quitPlus Markets should have been the natural home for a company the size of Oxford Nutrascience. Instead on Monday, when the Plus board was shaken up, another of the third-tier market’s companies announced plans to quit.TYI Holdings, which prints digital photos on canvas, joined Plus in May 2008 to raise its profile, and it easier to make acquisitions and raise funds. It took less than two years to realise that its quote was an expensive waste of time. Its rapid departure underlines how tough Plus’s road to profitability will be.david.blackwell@ft.com
210;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-02-09T17:46:07Z;Mothercare to supply clothing to Boots;Exclusive children’s wear deal;Mothercare has secured a deal to supply children’s clothing and accessories to Boots, underlining the baby product retailer’s determination to expand its wholesale business.The new children’s wear range will be available exclusively in Boots, the health and beauty retailer, from the autumn and will allow Mothercare to boost high-street sales even as it increasingly focuses its own store portfolio on out-of-town locations.Boots currently stocks a children’s wear brand called Mini Mode, supplied by Adams, the children’s wear chain. Adams fell into administration for the third time in January.Alex Gourlay, chief executive of the health and beauty division at Alliance Boots, said: “We believe this move will further strengthen our baby and child range and build on our reputation for offering great value children’s wear.”Ben Gordon, chief executive of Mothercare, said the deal was a “natural progression” in its relationship with Boots. Mothercare already supplies its Early Learning Centre toys to more than 400 Boots stores.“We’ve had a relationship with Boots for a long time, through the Early Learning Centre,” he said. “That partnership has grown over a few years, so it was a natural progression, with our expertise in children’s clothing, that we’d do a deal with Boots. It’s not sudden, it’s something we’ve been working towards.”Mothercare highlighted its interest in expanding its wholesale division at its interim results in November, when Mr Gordon said wholesale could be a “significant growth stream”.“It’s all part of the Mothercare story evolving,” Mr Gordon said yesterday. “We’re acting more as a brand than a retailer”.Andrew Wade, analyst at Numis, said the partnership with Boots could contribute about £5m to Mothercare’s pre-tax profit in 2012.“Clearly it’s accretive to profits but it’s also an example of Mothercare leveraging its brand and infrastructure to develop the new wholesale channel,” said Mr Wade. ”The deal enables the business to reduce its high street rent exposure, while continuing to build sales.”Shares in Mothercare fell 1½p to 640½p.
211;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-02-07T16:57:10Z;Obama push poses threat to Goldman;;The Obama administration’s push for a separation of banking and speculative financial activities, such as private equity investing, is raising questions about Goldman Sachs’ strategy for fending off competition from commercial banks, industry executives say.For all its recent success, Goldman has been plagued by worries about its lending abilities since the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial banking activities, such as lending, from investment banking services, such as underwriting.The repeal helped former commercial banks such as Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase to market themselves aggressively as “one-stop shops” capable of offering loans and investment banking services to corporate clients.This threatened Goldman’s investment banking franchise, but the company resisted the temptation to dive into commercial banking – becoming a bank holding company under pressure from regulators only in 2008.Goldman addressed its lack of lending firepower by setting up funds in its private equity group that invested in loans and less senior “mezzanine” bank debt that are used to finance buy-out deals, people familiar with the matter say. These funds sit on $23bn raised from the company, its employees and its well-heeled clients.The Goldman loan funds mimic the lending functions of commercial banks but are structured as hedge funds, meaning they charge a management fee and keep a percentage of profits above a target level known as a “hurdle rate”.The question facing Goldman is whether it could continue to operate its loan funds in the same way if Mr Obama persuades Congress to pass legislation that would force lenders to give up private equity and hedge fund investing operations.Although key details of the Obama plan remain in doubt – as does passage of any financial reform legislation– the push is significant for Goldman, given its record in running its loan funds in parallel with its investing and advisory operations.Executives at companies that have hired Goldman as an adviser on buy-out deals say it has won mandates because it could commit money from its bank-debt funds to transactions.The head of financing for a private equity group that hired Goldman to advise on a deal said: “Goldman’s ‘mezz’ and loan funds have definitely been a competitive advantage for them”.Any investment by the Goldman bank-debt funds must be approved by an advisory committee of outside investors, and Goldman says 90 per cent of the deals brought to the bank-debt funds by its investment bankers are rejected.Deals in which Goldman bank-debt funds and Goldman advisors have participated included the buy-out of Alliance Boots by KKR, Blackstone’s buy-out of the theme park holdings of Anheuser-Busch InBev, CVC’s acquisition of Pilot Travel Centers and the acquisition of IMS Health by TPG and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board.Goldman’s mezzanine funds played an important role while capital markets were in disarray. Goldman’s $13bn mezzanine fund was able to promise clients it would take up as much as $400m in junior debt in a single deal.“Their debt funds have been integral to their getting mandates from clients to raise capital,” said one buy-out group’s head of capital raising.
212;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-02-03T23:01:40Z;AA union to ballot on pension offer;;The AA roadside assistance group has made a last-ditch attempt to avoid another potentially damaging spat with unions by sweetening its offer to reform its final salary pension scheme.The stakes are high. Three years ago the private equity owners of the AA were dragged into a heated dispute with unions about job cuts that ended up with buy-out bosses being called before a parliamentary inquiry into their industry.The move to change the terms of the AA’s defined benefit pension scheme comes after similar schemes have been closed to existing members by some of the UK’s biggest companies, including Barclays, Wm Morrison, Alliance Boots and Vodafone.However, unions suspect the AA is trying to cut costs as Acromas, its parent company, prepares for a possible initial public offering, which would make it a FTSE 100 company with a value of as much as £10bn.The Independent Democratic Union, which represents many of the AA’s 7,000 staff, said it would put the company’s improved offer to a ballot of its members and would consider calling for a strike if it was rejected.Andrew Strong, chief executive of the AA, said the company had improved its offer on reforming the pension system. Instead of capping pensionable salary increases at 1 per cent a year, they would be capped at 2.5 per cent.“We haven’t come across many recent examples of companies that have reviewed their pension schemes and come up with such minor changes,” Mr Strong told the Financial Times.The AA pension had a deficit of £190m in November.But Alistair Maclean, national secretary of the IDU, said the offer was still unlikely to be acceptable to his members. He said the union might yet ballot its members on industrial action, which could be the AA’s first national strike in its 105-year history.Permira and CVC bought the AA in 2004 for £1.7bn and cut 3,500 jobs, sparking the union backlash. In 2007 they merged the AA with Saga, the travel and insurance provider to over-50s.
213;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-01-29T22:21:28Z;Catcher in the Alps: Caulfield does Davos;;We’re privileged to welcome to the World Economic Forum, the distinguished writer and thinker, Professor Holden Caulfield, 76-year-old president and founder of Rye Introspective LLP. Mr Caulfield has taken as his theme today “Goddam Money: It Always Ends Up Making You Blue as Hell”. Holden – the floor is yours.Good afternoon. If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you probably want to know is what I think about banking reform, what I’d do about the broker-dealers, whether I’d ban proprietary trading and all that Paul Volcker kind of crap. But I don’t feel like going into it if you want to know the truth.Where I want to start is the day I came to Davos. You probably heard of it. Probably seen the publicity anyway. Can hardly avoid it. It always starts something like: “Since 1971, the Forum has been moulding men into splendid, clear-thinking world leaders.” Strictly for the birds. Clear-thinking? You have to be kidding. Place is miles from anywhere, cold as a witch’s teat and full of phonies.They’re the ones grumbling about intrusive regulation, making believe how they’re all sorry or something, but then saying how “the devil’s in the detail” or how the plans won’t work. Or the ones parroting what the authorities always say: “Banking is a game, boys. Banking is a game that one plays according to the rules.” Rules, my ass. The financial phonies say they love the goddam rules. But you can bet they’re already getting their hotshots to find a way round them.Anyway, my point is: aren’t these the sonuvabitches who got us into the mess in the first place? If I’d just screwed the world economy, I’d get the hell out and keep my head well down. But not these guys. Oh, no. They’re here and they’re angry. All off the record, of course. Jesus Christ. Bankers. They can drive you crazy. They really can.(With apologies to the late, great JD Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye)Britain’s tiny nest-eggsAre we a nation of borrowers or savers?The post-crisis era is supposedly all about de-leveraging: by companies, banks and households. But not everyone is playing ball. Yes, we are paying down debts, but savings actually declined for much of 2009. In fact, ING Direct calculates, the man on the Clapham omnibus has just £2,205, or less than two months’ of average take-home pay, in ready cash at the bank.This is not the picture painted by the Office of National Statistics, which is proud of British thrift: the household savings ratio recently rose to a 10-year high of 8.6 per cent of disposable income. But ING’s measure is more exacting, stripping out the very wealthy and treating mortgage payments as outgoings.Getting the measure of savings is vital, particularly as Britain is weaned off government-funded intensive care. Savings ratios fell from about 10 per cent in the mid-1990s to about 2 per cent by mid-2007, before the financial world began to unravel. The recent blip upwards came on the back of lower mortgage and tax payments, neither sustainable. There are other drags. Unemployment, or falling income, causes savers to eat into their deposits. An ageing society consumes its savings more rapidly – which is partly why Japan, notorious for squirrelling away money, has seen its savings rate fall below that of those spendthrifts in the US.For Britain, a land of homeowners, there is another wild card. Residential property accounts for 45 per cent of household assets and four-fifths of borrowing, according to ING. Inflated values create bigger pools of collateral to borrow against – for second homes, cars or even a golden anniversary cruise. Falling house prices would change those dynamics. ING Direct, as a deposit-taking institution, has a vested interest in portraying Brits as slackers when it comes to saving. Alas, it also has a point.Pension rights and wrongsMembers of defined benefit pension schemes (including this columnist) must prepare to hear a lot more about the unfairness of their retirement perks. Proposing the closure of Alliance Boots’ DB scheme to active members, Stefano Pessina, executive chairman, called it a “source of tension” between haves and have-nots. That doesn’t mean he can treat members’ rights in a cavalier way. Boots’ long-serving senior pharmacists must be DB scheme members and will need to be gently handled. The terms of a planned new defined contribution scheme will also have to be set carefully. Still, what seemed scandalous four years ago, when Rentokilbrusquely froze its final salary scheme, is now as inevitable as death and taxes.Savings: louise.lucas@ft.comandrew.hill@ft.com
214;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-01-29T20:10:34Z;Alliance Boots axes final-salary pension plan;;Alliance Boots, the retailer that was taken private in Europe’s biggest buy-out two and a half years ago, is to become the latest company to close its final-salary pension scheme to existing members.The health and beauty retailer and pharmaceutical wholesaler, taken private in 2007 by Stefano Pessina, executive chairman, and private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, said that it was consulting staff on closing its UK defined benefit scheme to future accruals for its 15,000 active members. It plans to introduce a new defined-contribution scheme.Mr Pessina denied that the move was a cost-cutting measure in the wake of the private-equity backed buy-out.“Believe me, we are not doing this to save money,” he said. “We hope many more people now will adhere to our new defined-contribution scheme.”Instead, Alliance Boots was making the change to bring “fairness for the employees. Ninety per cent of what we spend for the pension is for the benefit of 20 per cent of the UK employees, and 15 per cent of the overall employees of the group,” he said.The presence of the defined-benefit schemes, which closed to new members at least eight years ago, also in effect introduced wage inequality, when Alliance Boots sought to pay people the same wage for the same job.“In reality, the package we are giving different people can be dramatically different, and this is a source of tensions and also complicated for management,” said Mr Pessina, who last year attacked the unfairness of such schemes.Nevertheless, the comments will unnerve members of defined-benefit schemes, as Alliance Boots joins a growing list of companies closing their schemes to existing members. Just two weeks ago, DSG International, the electricals retailer, said that it was consulting on closing its final-salary scheme to its 2,400 existing members.Last year Barclays, Wm Morrison and Vodafone were among the companies that closed such schemes to existing members, and analysts warn that more could follow suit amid concerns about rising liabilities from factors such as low interest rates and people living longer.In spite of Alliance Boots schemes having a net retirement surplus – most of which refers to the UK – of £188m at March 2009, Mr Pessina said that he wanted to remove volatility from the company’s balance sheet.Alliance Boots said the change would not affect the benefits that employees had already earned, nor would it affect the pension entitlements of those who had left the group.Mr Pessina said Alliance Boots would also continue to meet the funding commitments made at the time of the buy-out. As part of the deal, he reached agreement with the pension trustees to continue funding the Boots pension scheme, paying in £418m over the next 10 years.
215;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2010-01-19T13:32:17Z;Buy-outs at 25-year low due to lack of credit;;The number of private equity deals in the UK hit a 25-year low last year, as the credit crisis cut off the supply of cheap debt and dissuaded business owners from selling out.There were 117 private equity deals in 2009, fewer than half the 243 deals the previous year, according to research from the Centre for Management Buy-out Research at Nottingham University, to be published today.This is the lowest number of deals since 1984, when the industry was still in its infancy and 59 deals, worth £188.6m, were completed.The total value of buy-out deals in 2009 was £4.7bn, compared with £18.2bn the previous year, and the lowest since 1995, when a £100m buy-out was considered very large.Christiian Marriott, director of Barclays Private Equity, which sponsors the research, said: ”In terms of deal activity, 2009 has been a very, very poor one for the industry and the figures show that clearly.”At its peak the UK buy-out market reached £43.4bn in 2007, when the Alliance Boots pharmacy chain was bought for £11bn.Some observers questioned how long the industry could sit on the sidelines before its future was questioned.Alex White, a partner at BDO, the accountants, said: ”The private equity model is based on buying things and selling them a few years later for a profit, but if you don’t buy anything for a few years, you run out of things to sell and the model breaks.”Private equity advisers said the hiatus of the past two years was creating pent-up demand among buy-out houses, which could trigger a rebound in activity in 2010.Nine out of 10 private equity houses expect to do more deals this year, according to a survey by BDO.Mr White said activity would increase as more companies were sold ahead of an expected rise in capital gains tax after the likely May general election.There was a slight rebound in private equity activity in the fourth quarter of 2009, as the value of buy-out deals increased 48 per cent from the previous quarter to £943m.However, this was still the lowest fourth-quarter figure for more than a decade.The 2009 figures would have been much lower if they had not included Permira’s £1.25bn purchase of NDS, the set-top box maker, which was announced in August 2008 but closed early last year.Barclays’ Mr Marriott said many private equity groups had been distracted by problems at companies they had bought with too much debt during the credit bubble and others were working to sell some of their better-performing investments.”I don’t think the model is broken, it is just recalibrating how it works,” he said.Private equity groups were forced to put more equity into their deals last year as banks cut back on lending.Equity rose from 48 per cent of the average buy-out to 64 per cent.The proportion of senior debt fell from 40 per cent to 31 per cent.
216;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-12-09T23:00:04Z;Alliance Boots eyes overseas expansion;;Alliance Boots is setting its sites on overseas expansion as it looks to build on progress since its £12.4bn ($20.2bn) buy-out with private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2007.Stefano Pessina, executive chairman, said the majority of the efforts since Alliance Boots was taken private in Europe’s biggest private equity buy-out had been focused on the UK.“We have done the bulk of the job in the UK,” he said. “We have dedicated most of our efforts in the UK. We still have a lot of things to do. We have not finished. We have another couple of years of hard work. But at least the foundation is there. The basis is there. We have done the main job.”Consequently Alliance Boots, which is celebrating 160 years of the Boots name, was now turning its efforts to overseas expansion, both in the wholesale business, where the market was consolidating, and in health and beauty retail.Mr Pessina said Alliance Boots could look to acquisitions, partnerships or selling Boots beauty products in other pharmacies, as well as organic growth.
217;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ACS pushes for patient testing in pharmacies;;Advanced Computer Software is in talks with J Sainsbury, Alliance Boots and other pharmacy chains about using its software to provide healthcare records to allow patient testing in high street pharmacies.“The government is trying to push more people into primary care for things like diabetes tests and cardiovascular tests. They prefer pharmacists to nurses as they’re more qualified,” said Vin Murria, chief executive.“It’s early stage, but we’re in talks with Boots and Sainsbury. We already have National Health Service approval for it,” she said.The push into pharmacies is likely to form part of the future organic growth of ACS, which has plans to help consolidate the primary care market of the NHS, which deals with non-emergency work such as walk-in polyclinics.“We’re seeing about two companies a week but we’re having to coach some of them into understanding the right valuations,” said Ms Murria.The group pulled off one of the largest secondary fundraisings this year on Aim when it raised £43m ($72m) in May, ahead of its intended target of £30m.Earnings for the group were boosted by the acquisitions of Business Systems Group and StaffPlan during the period as it developed from a cash shell into a healthcare software group. It has since bought OakLabs India, a privately-owned business based in Bangalore, to develop further IT products.Revenue for the six months to August 31 were £11m, compared with nil a year ago, while it moved from from a pre-tax loss of £240,000 to a profit of £1.9m. It had earnings per share of 0.5p compared with a loss per share of 0.5p a year ago.Shares rose 1p to 37p.
218;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-11-09T21:22:50Z;Buy-out groups see off Apoteket’s peers;;Private equity groups have triumphed over some of the most hotly tipped industry bidders in Sweden’s SKr5.9bn ($862m) auction of part of its state-owned Apoteket pharmacy chain.Alliance Boots, Europe’s largest pharmacy group, was among those that lost out as financial investors clinched almost two-thirds of the available stores, it was announced on Monday.The success of bidders including Altor and Segulah, both Nordic-focused buy-out funds, added to recent signs of revival in the region’s private equity market after a long period of subdued activity since the financial crisis.Fredrik Strömholm, partner at Altor, which won the biggest nationwide cluster of 208 Apoteket stores, said private equity groups may have found funding easier than rival bidders after husbanding resources during the downturn.“Some of the industrial parties have headaches in other markets that could have limited their ability to raise financing,” he said.The auction marked Altor’s second big acquisition from the Swedish government this year after a SKr2.2bn deal in February to buy Carnegie Investment Bank and an affiliated insurer taken over by the state during the crisis.Apoteket, which has held a monopoly on pharmaceutical sales since 1970, was one of several assets earmarked for sale by the centre-right government after its 2006 election a platform of cutting state involvement in the economy.The process has stalled since last year’s sale of Vin & Spirit, owner of the Absolut vodka brand, and Vasakronan, a property company, as the downturn depressed asset prices. But the government pressed on with the break-up of Apoteket under pressure from a European Court of Justice ruling that the monopoly broke European Union competition laws.About half of Apoteket’s 916 outlets were auctioned in clusters of varying sizes, offering a rare chance for investors to enter an under-developed pharmacy market in a wealthy European country. A further 150 stores will be sold to small businesses and the remaining outlets kept under state control.Oriola-KD, a Finnish pharmaceutical wholesaler, was the only successful industrial bidder, paying SKr1.56bn for 171 stores in a joint bid with Kooperativ Forbundet, a Swedish retailer. Financial details of the other winning bids were not provided but the government said that the total raised was SKr5.9bn.A smaller cluster of 24 outlets was won by Investor, the Swedish investment company controlled by the Wallenberg business family, and Privaq Investment, a private equity company.Peter Elving, partner at Segulah, which secured 62 stores in the Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo areas, said the complexity of dismantling a former state monopoly was best suited to private equity bidders.Apoteket is one of Sweden’s largest retailers, with 10,000 employees. It had revenues of SKr41.7bn and operating profits of SKr950m last year.People familiar with the situation told the Financial Times that Alliance Boots, best known for its UK Boots chain, was among the unsuccessful bidders. Tamro, another Finnish drug wholesaler, had also been widely expected to bid.Celesio, the German pharmaceutical trading group, and ICA, Sweden’s largest grocery chain, both opted out of the auction and plan to start their own pharmacy chains from scratch.
219;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Boots awaits news on Swedish auction;;Alliance Boots, Europe’s largest pharmacy group, is among the bidders poised to learn this week whether it has been successful in an auction for part of Sweden’s monopoly pharmaceutical retailer.The group, best known for its UK Boots brand, is bidding for one of two large clusters of pharmacy stores being sold by the Swedish government as part of its privatisation of the Apoteket chain, according to people familiar with the situation. The winning bidders could be announced on Monday.Apoteket is one of Sweden’s largest retailers, with 10,000 employees. It had revenues of SKr41.7bn (€4bn) and operating profits of SKr950m last year.The sell-off marks a step forward in efforts by Sweden’s centre-right government to reduce state involvement in the economy after years of pressure from the European Union to break up Apoteket and other national monopolies.“Sweden is one of only a few countries in the world, together with Cuba and North Korea, that have this kind of monopoly and it is time to do something about it,” said Göran Hägglund, Sweden’s health minister.The auction gives a rare chance for international investors to enter an under-developed pharmacy market in a wealthy European economy. Sealed bids were due late last month.Two-thirds of Apoteket’s 900 stores are being sold, with two nationwide clusters of 200 and 170 outlets and several smaller clusters. The remaining third will stay under state control.Alliance Boots, with pharmacies in the UK, Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, Italy, Russia and Thailand, was taken private by US private equity company Kohlberg Kravis Roberts two years ago in an £11.1bn deal.Other potential bidders for the two large Apoteket clusters include two Finnish pharmaceutical wholesalers, Oriola-KD and Tamro, and private equity groups. Winning bidders will take control in January.Celesio, the big German pharmaceutical trading group, said in July that it planned to seek its own premises in Sweden rather than bid for existing Apoteket outlets. ICA, Sweden’s largest supermarket chain, is also planning to open its own pharmacies.Sweden has been under pressure to open its pharmacy market since a 2005 ruling by the European Court of Justice that Apoteket was violating EU competition laws.The centre-left government at the time said it would not be forced to introduce the “Wild West in the sale of medicines”. But the election of a centre-right government in 2006 cleared the way for liberalisation.
220;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-11-07T00:31:30Z;An increasing fixation with false lashes;;"This month Max Factor launches yet another new mascara, one that promises to make lashes look up to 80 per cent longer. It will join the 187 new mascaras introduced to the UK market between October 2008 and 2009, and the 312 launched in the US (this from a Mintel “Mascara Launch” report – really; there are so many that they get their own paper).It seems impossible, and yet consider, according to high street chain Boots, that there are “approximately 600 different mascaras in our largest stores”. Meanwhile, Superdrug has seen sales of false lashes increase 97 per cent – almost double the number sold this time last year – and the UK false eyelashes business is now worth a reported £10m a year.The depth of the trend became clear in April, when Michelle Obama arrived at Buckingham Palace wearing …false eyelashes. Now, it seems, they know no age or cultural limit.“My two teenage daughters always ask if they can wear false lashes if they are going to a party – and they already have long lashes,” says make-up artist Jackie Tyson. “Then, recently I did Yoko Ono’s make-up for an appearance on the BBC’s Later With Jools Holland: false lashes and red lipstick. She is 76 and she looked great.”“It goes back to the Hollywood glamour of the 1930s and 1940s, when all the stars had lash inserts,” Tyson adds. “That lasted until the 1960s, when Twiggy took the false lash look to the extreme, wearing several sets together.” Although there was a slight lull during the minimal, no-make-up 1990s, Tyson says, “in the past two or three years I don’t think I have made up a celebrity without lashes – at their request. I think they feel better once they have the lashes on, it gives them confidence.” Note that on talent show The X-Factor, both Cheryl Cole and Dannii Minogue wear them.Make-up artist Kay Montano cites the rise of individual eyelashes. This involves the exacting and subtle application of single lashes in order to open up the eye. “About 10 years ago the average consumer might not have known about false lashes, but now it goes straight from the make-up artist’s mouth into the magazine – and then Eyelure makes them,” she says.As Tyson points out, “People want to emulate their favourite stars”. But apart from a celebrity copycat culture, this fixation with lashes and lash-enhancing make-up may also underscore a more primordial yearning.Dr Bernhard Fink, a research scientist at the Department of Sociobiology/Anthropology at the University of Goettingen in Germany, says: “Cosmetics and make-up exaggerate the features that men are usually sensitive to, thus making those women highly attractive to them. Eyes and eye gaze are of particular relevance in terms of showing interest and attention. It has been reported that people looking directly at an observer receive higher facial attractiveness judgments. I believe that showing exaggerated (and groomed) eyelashes highlights the eyes; it draws attention to them, not because the lashes per se are important, but because the eyes are the key features.”Besides, Dr Fink points out, “hair tends to grow slower when we age. Thus, long eye lashes signal youth.”And yet, says Aaron de Mey, artistic director for Lancôme, “We’re at the limit of how far it can go. The over-exaggerated lash looks too harsh. It’ll go back to the eye lash curler and a bit of brown mascara. There will always be mascara.”"
221;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-11-03T23:01:05Z;Alliance Boots buys back debt at discount;;Alliance Boots has bought back more than £500m ($821m) of debt since the beginning of this year at a deep discount from distressed sellers.But the chain, taken private by Stefano Pessina and KKR in Europe’s biggest ever buy-out two years ago, warned that the best opportunities for purchasing debt could be behind it.“It was an opportunity not to be missed,” said George Fairweather, finance director.Since the start of 2009, Alliance Boots has bought debt with a face value of £558m for a cash cost of £324m. Of this, debt with a face value of £367m was bought for £239m of cash in the six months to September 30.“If we see debt at attractive prices, we will very much consider it,” said Mr Fairweather.Hoe added, however: “The debt is still trading at a discount because of the banking [crisis] but not at the sort of levels we were able to purchase earlier in the year.”Such debt buy-backs have become more common in the credit crunch and have raised some eyebrows. But Mr Fairweather, who said Alliance Boots’ underlying debt was about £9bn, defended the move.“We were disappointed to see our debt trading at such low levels given the strong performance of the group,” he said.The comments came as Alliance Boots, of which Andy Hornby, former chief executive of HBOS, has been group chief executive since July, increased sales 11.6 per cent to £9bn in the six months to September 30.It did not provide any profit figures but Mr Fairweather said the group was on track to deliver an increase in profits this year.Sales at Boots UK rose 4 per cent, with sales from stores open at least a year ahead 3.4 per cent.Mr Fairweather said sales had been boosted by consumers’ concerns about swine flu.He said people were making sure they had cough and cold medicines, adding: “Customers are very much focused on washing their hands and having the right products to do that.”Wholesale revenue rose 13.8 per cent to £6.1bn, with like-for-like revenue at constant currencies up 3.1 per cent.Mr Fairweather played down the prospects of a swift initial public offering.“There is no doubt that the stock market has come back from where it was. But there is a lot we can still do to improve and grow our business under private ownership,” he said.
222;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-10-27T20:45:06Z;Private equity groups circle Matalan;;Some of the world’s biggest private equity groups are queuing to examine £1.5bn ($2.4bn) bids for Matalan, the discount retailer, which has received interest in recent days from KKR, Blackstone, Cinven and TPG.CVC Capital Partners, the UK-based private equity group, has a head start over its rivals after it made the initial approach to Matalan and held a preliminary meeting with the retailer’s management about a deal.But since then, several big private equity groups have been scrambling for position in the early stages of an auction, which is being run by PwC. All parties declined to comment on Tuesday.“All big private equity groups are asking themselves if they should look at Matalan,” said a banker who is working with one potential bidder. “CVC has a head start, but that doesn’t mean they will win in the end.”CVC has experience of the UK retail sector having been part of the consortium that bought Debenhams. KKR owns Alliance Boots, the pharmacy chain, while TPG was also part of the Debenhams deal.Cinven has backed several UK retailers that it has since sold, including Hamleys and Peacocks, and it still owns Camaïeu in France and Maxeda in the Netherlands.Bankers said that private equity groups were likely to be able to raise debt financing quite easily for a buy-out of Matalan.“This is a defensive business that does well in a downturn,” said one banker. “It is the right business model in its pricing and products for banks to lend to.”Matalan has ridden the tide of cash-strapped consumers trading down to discount retailers. It has also improved its product ranges, revamped stores and introduced new brands.A sale would net hundreds of millions of pounds for John Hargreaves, the founder and controlling shareholder, who took the business private three years ago in an £817m deal.It is unlikely that Matalan would ever return to public ownership, given Mr Hargreaves’ clash with investors and non-executive directors when he took the business private.

Staff at one of them, Gardners, said the company has been asked to take on more business as a result of delays to orders going through the hub.Mr Johnston said Waterstone’s had a long trading relationship with Gardners but was using the company more than previously.Waterstone’s stores began receiving complaints from customers frustrated with delays to their orders soon after the hub was openedThe company outsourced the centre’s operations to Unipart, a logistics group that works with many leading UK retailers, including Homebase and Boots. The group was not initially equipped to handle the high number of requests for academic books, which require more man hours to process than other orders.Unipart declined to comment but Mr Johnston said: “It is fair to say that in September there were some issues with handling academic orders, which required a lot of manual handling. But in the past two months we have moved on quite considerably.”Analysts said the problems are unlikely seriously to undermine profits at Waterstone’s, which is owned by HMV Group, even though it will have to pay more to use third-party distributors rather than buying directly from publishers.Andrew Wade, a retail analyst at Numis Securities, said: “If they have not got these issues under control by Christmas, we could see an impact on profitability.”
224;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Tax change throws buy-backs into doubt;;UK companies looking to restructure debts have had their plans thrown into doubt after the Treasury tightened up tax rules around debt buy-backs.The changes – which follow fears that the government was thought to be losing hundreds of millions of pounds of lost revenue – will force companies that buy back debt at a discount to recognise immediately any profit on the buy-back.Marcus Rea, director at Deloitte, said the number of debt buy-backs could fall significantly as a result.Many companies, such as Alliance Boots, the retailer, and Endemol, the maker of Big Brother, have taken advantage of depressed markets to buy back debt cheaply. European companies have bought back more than €1bn (£912m) of their debt this year, according to S&P LCD.Banks too have been buying back debt. In March, Royal Bank of Scotland launched a £14.8bn debt exchange and buy-back programme that the bank said resulted in an aggregate pre-tax gain of £4.6bn.Advisers said the new tax measure might have been aimed at banks, pointing to a reference to “many banks and other businesses” in the explanation of the rule change by Stephen Timms, financial secretary to the Treasury. One lawyer said: “The banks are in their sights.”Though companies in severe financial distress will be exempt, some lawyers believe the move could create uncertainty for time-sensitive restructurings involving buy-backs to help companies struggling against the downturn.“For companies going through financial restructuring where a debt buy-back is part of the plan, it creates a problem because it is unclear what the implications are, particularly for companies that already have signed up to deals,” said Lydia Challen, partner at Allen & Overy.“While the Treasury says it doesn’t want to stop companies in distress using this tool, from many of these companies’ perspective the proposed changes might be the equivalent of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and it might now be too tricky for these companies to restructure using this technique,” said Mr Rea.The Treasury said: “Legislation is being amended to ensure that it only applies in cases where company rescues are taking place. The measure is intended to address companies who undertake transactions that have no commercial justification in order to avoid a tax charge.”
225;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-10-01T22:00:53Z;KKR listing;;A public private equity company may be an oxymoron, but the Dutch listing of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts marks the start of its European reconnaissance mission. Desperate for a New York listing in 2007, plans were shelved as the credit crisis erupted. Sneaking through the back door, via a merger with Amsterdam listed co-investors KKR Private Equity Investors, is an interim step.The 30 per cent slice of the overall group that KPE investors now own provides a lower profile testing ground for the inevitable New York listing. Since the announcement in July, KPE shares have charged ahead 75 per cent to $9.43. Over the same period, listed rival Blackstone’s stock has increased by half that amount. If KKR achieves some good exits, as it expects to with its Dollar General discount stores, investors will feel more confident come the full listing of the firm itself.Like Blackstone, KKR is no longer just a private equity firm. For investors in a public listing the diversification into debt investing and backwards integration into investment banking offers alternative revenue sources while private equity remains in the doldrums.KKR’s bread and butter though remains private equity, and global markets continue to offer no favours. Faltering investor demand pushed third-quarter fundraising to $38bn, the lowest level since 2003 and about a fifth of 2007’s high, according to Preqin. And it now takes about 18 months to raise a fund, half as much time again as in 2007. KKR’s biggest deal this year was the $1.8bn acquisition of Oriental Brewery which pales compared with the 2007 purchases of Alliance Boots for £11.1bn and Texas utility TXU for $44bn. Mr Kravis and Mr Roberts have much to prove to investors expectant of a return to the swashbuckling deal closing days.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
226;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-10-01T19:58:11Z;Applegarth to advise US private equity group;;"Adam Applegarth, the former chief executive of Northern Rock, has joined Apollo Global Management as a senior adviser to its European distressed debt fund, becoming the latest fallen corporate boss to seek refuge in private equity.Two years after he left Northern Rock with an £840,000 pay-off and having come under fire from politicians for the bank’s nationalisation, Mr Applegarth has joined Apollo’s European Principal Fund, a €1bn (£912m) distressed debt vehicle.Apollo, one of the world’s most secretive private equity groups, hopes to benefit from Mr Applegarth’s knowledge of UK mortgage lenders’ books. The former Northern Rock boss has been working at Apollo for a month.His arrival at the private equity group – where he will work as a part-time consultant – highlights how private equity has become a sanctuary for well-known corporate bosses who have left their companies under a cloud in recent years.Andy Hornby, former chief executive of HBOS, joined Alliance Boots as chief executive in July, teaming up with the pharmacy chain’s private equity owners KKR and Stefano Pessina, its executive chairman.Other ousted corporate bosses to join private equity include Lord Browne, former BP chief executive, who quit the oil group in 2007 to work at Apax Partners and later joined Riverstone Holdings, the US energy buy-out group.For besmirched corporate chiefs, private equity offers the double benefit of being out of the public limelight, while offering them an opportunity to make serious money from profit sharing schemes.Luc Vandevelde and Roger Holmes both joined Change Capital Partners, a retail buy-out group, after quitting as chairman and chief executive of Marks and Spencer in 2004.In the US, Cerberus Capital Management hired Bob Nardelli in 2007 to take charge of its buy-out of carmaker Chrysler after he left Home Depot amid a storm of criticism for his $210m severance package. At about the same time, Kevin Rollins joined TPG as an adviser after being ousted as Dell’s chief executive.Mr Applegarth joined Northern Rock as a graduate trainee in 1983, rising to general manager 10 years later and chief executive in 2000.The lender, which made losses of £1.4bn last year, made a £108,675 payment to the pension pot of Mr Applegarth, who is widely blamed for the bank’s plight. This was on top of his £731,629 compensation payment for loss of office.Vince Cable, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said at the time that Mr Applegarth’s package was “outrageous”. He added: “This is a straightforward reward for failure.”Apollo launched its European Principal Fund in May 2007 to take advantage of the opportunities thrown up by the credit crunch to buy portfolios of non-performing loans. The fund has raised €1bn towards a target of €1.5bn and focuses on buying distressed portfolios of corporate loans, residential and commercial mortgages from banks in the UK, Germany, Spain and Portugal. The fund has about 20 staff.Apollo first encountered Mr Applegarth through its ill-judged buy-out of
Countrywide, the UK’s biggest real estate chain, which it acquired for £1.05bn at the peak of the property bubble in 2007.The New York-based group has since lost control of Countrywide after a debt-for-equity swap handed majority ownership to its rival Oaktree Capital.Apollo has also suffered a string of problem deals in the US, including the bankruptcy of Linens ’n Things, the US home goods retailer."
227;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-09-24T19:12:00Z;Waitrose reaches into the high street;;"Shoppers in branches of Boots will soon be able to pick up Waitrose food as part of a push by the upmarket retailer into convenience shopping.The two companies said they would trial the sale of “very selective product ranges” in each others’ stores, with Waitrose food in Alliance Boots stores, and healthcare ranges in Waitrose.The trial is part of a wider move into the convenience sector that could eventually see the number of Waitrose’s standalone stores double, pitching the grocer famed for its quality against Marks and Spencer.Mark Price, managing director of Waitrose, said there was potential for about 300 Waitrose convenience stores of between 2,000 and 7,000 sq ft over the next five to 10 years. It will also continue to add between eight and 10 largeformat stores a year. By the end of this year, Waitrose will have 225 stores.Mr Price defended the move into convenience, which will see Waitrose enter a market dominated by the big supermarket chains. Tesco already operates convenience stores, J Sainsbury is expanding further into this market and Wm Morrison is poised to add more smaller stores.“The big growth areas in food retail are convenience . . . and online,” he said. “Our plans are to make sure that Waitrose is in a place to dominate on both of those.”Shares in M&S fell 11.1p to 372.9p. One analyst said news of Waitrose’s plans was “not what you want to hear at M&S”. M&S declined to comment.Thirteen Alliance Boots-owned pharmacies in Waitrose stores will be rebranded as Boots pharmacies. The supermarket also said it was extending its deal with Welcome Break, adding a further nine outlets at its service stations after trialing two.Mr Price said the potential for 300 convenience stores excluded the “hundreds and hundreds” of Alliance Boots stores where Waitrose could sell food.People familiar with the talks said there would be
no change to Alliance Boots’ existing food supply arrangements for the foreseeable future.Mr Price said Waitrose would invest a “significant amount of money” in the push into convenience, but this would be supported by its strong balance sheet and growth rate."
228;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-09-22T15:01:58Z;Flu vaccine price war hits high street;;Asda, the supermarket chain, has launched a price war for the seasonal flu vaccine with plans to offer injections at £8 each, undercutting high street rivals and the price it offered in its own stores last year.The company portrayed the move as a way to ease pressure on “struggling medical centres” in the National Health Service, which are gearing up for mass vaccinations to protect against the pandemic H1N1 swine flu strain.Asda’s strategy signals a drive to boost volumes amid higher competition between retailers moving into pharmacy activities. High street stores – including Tesco, Wm Morrison, and J. Sainsbury – are offering the vaccine, alongside specialist chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Lloyds Pharmacy.Asda said its move came amid heightened awareness of flu because of the H1N1 pandemic and that vaccination requirements for Muslims undertaking the pilgrimage to Mecca would likely boost demand.Seasonal flu vaccine gives no protection from the pandemic H1N1 strain, and there are signs that seasonal strains are being “crowded out” by swine flu. World Health Organisation experts are meeting in Melbourne this week to recommend which of the most widespread strains should be used in next year’s vaccine.However, a Health Protection Agency spokeswoman said: “What we have seen in the southern hemisphere is that the H1N1 pandemic strain is the predominant strain but there are still other flu viruses circulating.”The NHS provides free seasonal flu vaccines for high-risk groups. It will offer the pandemic vaccine for free in the coming weeks – initially to high-risk groups – once it gets regulatory approval.Asda said its £8 charge compared with £10 from Tesco, Wm Morrison and Superdrug and £15 from Boots. Asda charged £10 last year, undercutting its rivals, although Tesco then cut its own price to match.GlaxoSmithKline, the UK-based pharmaceutical company, said it sold its seasonal and pandemic vaccines for an average of about £5.
229;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-09-17T21:38:10Z;Merckle empire unravels with Ratiopharm sale;;The break-up of the late Adolf Merckle’s industrial empire gained pace on Thursday when the German entrepreneur’s family holding company launched a sales process for Ratiopharm, the world’s fourth-largest generic drugs maker.VEM Vermögensverwaltung, Merckle’s main investment company, said detailed offer documents would be sent to potential bidders at the beginning of October.The move marks the second big step in a week towards a restructuring of the highly indebted and crumbling empire of Merckle, the billionaire German industrialist who committed suicide in January after financial bets went badly wrong.Earlier this week, it emerged that the Merckle family was looking to sell a stake of up to 50 per cent in HeidelbergCement, the German cement maker.Merckle’s banks have recently extended a debt moratorium on the family holding by 18 months, buying time for a sale of some of its assets to reduce debt.The sale of the HeidelbergCement stake could bring in more than €2bn ($3bn) and – in a best-case scenario – the sale of Ratiopharm could yield more than €3bn.The family has also flagged Phoenix, a large pharmaceuticals wholesaler, for a potential sale. But, if the other planned sales are successful, the family would likely be able to hold on to Phoenix, people familiar with the matter said.Phoenix has in the past attracted the interest of KKR, the private equity group that also owns Alliance Boots, the pan-European pharmacy chain. But Phoenix has a convoluted ownership structure that would complicate any sale.Ratiopharm’s sales process, led by Commerzbank and Royal Bank of Scotland, could attract at least a dozen trade buyers and private equity groups.Hans-Joachim Ziems, VEM’s managing director, said: “The large number of interested parties at such an early stage emphasises the attractiveness of the Ratiopharm group.”Israeli generic group Teva, French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis, US company Mylan and a series of financial investors are believed to be among the possible suitors.German rivals Hexal and Stada are being hampered by antitrust issues but could bid for Ratiopharm’s Canadian business.The Merckle family has not ruled out selling parts of the business, but it said it preferred not to break up the group.VEM aims to complete the sale in the first quarter of 2010.People close to the situation said some banks were looking at putting together a debt package that could be offered to financial bidders to help fund a bid – a rare move in the wake of the financial crisis.“This is a litmus test for the financing market,” one banker involved in the discussions said.
230;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
231;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-09-02T21:51:58Z;Views you can use;;The schoolteacher was not happy with the inflatable solar system set that was meant to be engaging and educating children in the classroom, and went on the supplier’s website to say so. “I opened the package, blew up the planets, hung them in my classroom, and came in the next day to find three blobs of rubber hanging from the ceiling,” complained the teacher last September. “Totally disappointed!!!!”The blow-up solar system had been bought from Oriental Trading Company, a US catalogue and internet retailer, for about $18. The teacher was not alone: at the end of last year, other customers buying the set from Oriental were just as unhappy – and were going online to say so.They complained in reviews on the company’s website that the sun, the eight planets and Pluto would often just not stay inflated.With customers regularly giving the product low scores on its site, Oriental contacted the manufacturer. By January, its customer service team was able to an­nounce that it had worked with the makers to make sure the planets stayed inflated. A series of five-star reviews suggests the deflation problem is over.The experience illustrates the evolution of a feature that is increasingly familiar in online transactions: originally seen as an aid to other potential buyers, on­line reviews are becoming a valued source of direct customer feedback for retailers and manufacturers.Samsung Electronics started hosting reviews on its US website last year, using technology and processing provided by Bazaarvoice, which has become the dominant provider of third-party review services in the US since it started in 2005 in a single office in Austin, Texas.Bazaarvoice now works with more than 500 brands belonging to companies including Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Boots, Argos, Lego and Procter & Gamble. It has 400 employees providing services in 25 languages, and offices in London, Paris and Singapore, says Brett Hurt, co-founder and chief executive.At Samsung, using reviews as a source of feedback “has changed some aspects of the way we work, primarily because of the speed with which information comes in”, says Kris Narayanan, Samsung’s director of marketing. “It helps us look at issues as they arise. If there is a malfunction or a problem then we identify it very early.”The company has used reviews in this way for less than a year, but Mr Narayanan says Samsung has already changed products in response to the new kind of feedback. For instance, large flat-panel televisions were initially produced with speakers on the side. When customers pointed out in their reviews that the units were too wide to fit into conventional cabinets, Samsung put the speakers below the screen.“It was certainly the product reviews that clinched the issue,” Mr Narayanan says.The Container Store, a US home storage retailer, plans to introduce customer reviews on its website this year to help shape product development. Using customer feedback is not new, says Casey Priest, marketing communications vice-president. “But that was based on people writing on customer comments sheets. This will take it to a whole new level.”Sears Holdings, which owns retailers Kmart and Sears, says it is increasingly passing on information from its online reviews to suppliers, says Rob Harles, head of Sears’s online community activities.For Samsung, reviews are just one of several sources of consumer input it monitors, including specialised discussion boards on consumer electronics websites such as CNet, as well as the less structured discussions on social media sites such as Facebook, MySpace and Twitter.With so much opinion to keep an eye on, the company tries to focus on analysing “qualified” input – opinions from customers who know what they are talking about. “We spend a tremendous amount of resources trying to parse through the qualified brand opinion,” says Mr Narayanan, rather than a spurious mention that does not truly represent meaningful input or opinion about the brand.Sam Decker, chief marketing officer at Bazaarvoice, says brands’ interest in such “social commerce”, as he calls it, has ballooned because it is more measurable, in contrast to the efforts of brands to analyse the less focused input from open social sites. “For all the hype and impact social networks make, it is a really thin bridge to what a company cares about, which is bottom line impact. We are trying to make this a very broad bridge. Not only is it measurable with the same measures that you use today, but the contacts with the customers are going to endure.”Internet shoppers are increasingly turning to reviews on websites. Nielsen, the marketing re­search group, says its twice-yearly global survey of more than 25,000 online consumers found in April that 70 per cent trusted product reviews posted online, an increase of 9 percentage points on April 2007.Bazaarvoice says it is seeing interest from manufacturers in putting its review service on their websites and then “syndicating” the reviews to retail sites such as Walmart.com.Brands have also begun using their most positive reviews in other marketing channels such as catalogues, or in-store marketing materials. Sephora, the cosmetics retailer, is testing in-store advertising that gives customers a code to access reviews on their mobile phones.Just two years ago, Mr Decker says, opening up a site to potentially critical third-party reviews was a big decision for retailers, and usually had to be approved by the CEO. Now, some retailers actively solicit reviews: Sears Holdings recently offered customers the chance to participate in a sweepstake by submitting reviews to its new MySears and MyKmart community websites.Argos, the UK catalogue retail­er, which started running customer reviews last year, found customers were 10 per cent more likely to buy products that had been reviewed on its site than those without them. When it e-mailed recent customers to ask them to submit reviews, the company received more than 200,000 in the first four months of 2009, with 70,000 in one day alone.
232;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-08-17T20:44:05Z;Each company deserves its own high pay commission;;Add my name to the list. A high pay commission is a good idea. In fact, it’s such a good idea, let’s impose one on every company in the land.Like the Low Pay Commission, each committee would be drawn from a deep pool of knowledge and experience. Before making recommendations on pay, members of these committees would carry out extensive research and consultation, drawing on outside expertise where necessary, sharing best practice. They would talk to owners and staff. They would look at compensation around the company, the country and, where relevant, the world. Above all, members of these committees would look at performance. How do top executives compare with rivals, not just financially, but in terms of respect for the environment, safety and other relevant benchmarks?These high pay commissions would have the edge over the LPC. They would be democratically appointed. They would be subject to regular votes on their policy, and individuals on their performance. So, incidentally, would the officers whose salaries and bonuses the commissions had approved. If excessive pay undermined the company or caused a customer backlash, they would face sanctions from pension schemes, local authorities and individuals.Idealism? No. Institutional investors and remuneration committees got it wrong. They need to be far more attentive and rigorous. But the current system can work and should continue to work, even after the economy recovers and pressure on share prices eases. If the threat of messy, counter-productive legislation to cap pay has any impact, it should be to give our ready made company-specific “high pay commissions” a huge incentive to get it right next time.White smoke at BATHaving “bank” on your CV is no longer a barrier to future gainful employment. That is one conclusion that will be drawn if Richard Burrows, former governor (i.e. chairman) of Bank of Ireland, is appointed chairman of British American Tobacco. The fact the news comes after Andy Hornby, former HBOS chief executive, won a chance at rehabilitation from Alliance Boots, and coincides with pictures of Sir Fred Goodwin, back in Edinburgh from self-imposed exile in France, just proves it.Not so fast. Mr Burrows endured a tongue-lashing from Bank of Ireland investors earlier this year and volunteered his resignation. His fate was shared by many directors of Irish banks. They made a collective strategic error to expose their institutions to the property boom and deservedly took the rap.But Bank of Ireland was at the “less bad” end of the spectrum – more Lloyds TSB (pre-HBOS) than Royal Bank of Scotland, according to one analyst. Mr Burrows can also boast previous experience as a top executive in the drinks industry, which would recommend him to the cigarette manufacturer.If BAT chooses Mr Burrows, it may reflect the fact that employers are starting to distinguish, rightly, between bank bosses who did the right thing by stepping down, and bosses who indubitably did the wrong thing by driving their banks into the mire. It doesn’t change the fact that blue-chip chairmen are in short supply. But not so short that a second chance for Mr Burrows means a similar second chance for every Fred, Vic and Andy.Checkpoint CharliesA work visa is a prerequisite for even a short business trip to the US as a journalist. One consolation as I waited to renew mine last week in the US embassy – hoping that my declared membership of Lancashire County Cricket Club and the National Trust was no bar to entry – was the feeling that somewhere in a British embassy hapless prospective workers were being made to jump through similar hoops. Alas, it turns out they were.The points-based immigration scheme for working visas, introduced in a rush last year, is failing British businesses by accidentally blocking the entry of talented graduates or the relocation of overseas executives, just when the need to buy in international talent and keep pace with global competitors is most pressing.Good, you may say, UK companies will have to hire here, as they should – particularly in a downturn. But the new rules were drawn up specifically to let in only those foreign high-flyers whose presence here was deemed essential. The irony is that the government answered advance criticism the system would be too complicated (and open to abuse by well-connected HR departments) only to fall into the trap of over-simplicity.

233;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-08-16T22:09:53Z;BAT’s chairman choice risks controversy;;British American Tobacco is to risk controversy by appointing as chairman a former governor of the Bank of Ireland.Richard Burrows will take on one of the most powerful roles in British business when his position at the world’s second biggest cigarette maker is confirmed later this week.He will replace Jan du Plessis, who announced in April that he was stepping down after taking up the chairmanship of Rio Tinto, the miner.Mr Burrows resigned from Bank of Ireland at its annual meeting in May after being forced to apologise for falling profits and share prices.The bank has been badly hit by the financial crisis and received support from the state.“I apologise to our stockholders for the loss in value of their stock and for the cancellation of dividends,” he told investors at the bank’s annual meeting. “Accountability for these losses must be taken at the top and, accordingly, I have informed my fellow directors of my personal decision to stand down from the court.”Some investors have been reluctant to see board members of banks that have been rescued by tax payers taking key positions at other companies. The decision by Alliance Boots, the retail chain, to hire Andy Hornby, who led HBOS into its forced merger with Lloyds TSB, was widely criticised.However, BAT’s biggest investors are said to have accepted that Mr Burrows is an experienced boardroom operator.Mr Burrows was a former chief executive of Pernod Ricard, the drinks company, and now holds board positions at Carlsberg and Rentokil Initial, the pest control group.In Ireland, Mr Burrows was best known for his role as the former chief executive of Irish Distillers, a position that he held for 22 years, and during which time he pioneered the global expansion of Jameson whisky.BAT, whose brands include Lucky Strike, Dunhill and Kent, is among the top 10 quoted companies in the FTSE 100.It employs 56,000 workers and has 49 factories in 41 countries.It operates in 180 markets and is the most international of all the tobacco companies.BAT reported a 16 per cent rise in first-half profits at the end of July driven by an increase in cigarette prices and recent acquisitions.Pre-tax profits at BAT in the first half of the year rose from £1.8bn ($2.9bn) to £2.1bn and revenue was up by 24 per cent, from £5.5bn to £6.8bn.BAT declined to comment on Sunday.
234;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-08-10T21:20:42Z;Historians look to the future;;Helping designers to develop skincare products was not what Sophie Clapp (above) had in mind when she trained as an archivist. But after working with Churchill’s wartime papers — via a spell in Unilever’s archive — that is what she ended up doing, at Boots. The result was Boots Original Beauty Formula, an apothecary-style range marking the company’s 160th anniversary.“Our formulators had a field day,” says Annabel Franks, head of beauty brands at Boots UK. Her team spent days with Ms Clapp rooting through handwritten recipes, illustrated price lists from the 1920s, and painted tins and jars. “It was one of those magical moments when everything came together.”The launch of the Boots heritage-inspired range comes when archivists worldwide are facing job cuts and battling to save historic collections threatened with dispersal. In the US, the upheavals in the automotive market have prompted car enthusiasts to speculate online about the long-term future of archives at Chrysler and other carmakers. Across industry, businesses are reducing archive teams, says Linda Edgerly, managing director of the Winthrop Group, a US archive consultancy.The news is not all bad. In defiance of the downturn, businesses as diverse as Bulgari, Marks and Spencer and Audi are using milestone anniversaries to celebrate their heritage. Other companies are delving into their archives to learn from past recessions, inspire new products and arm lawyers with evidence to win trademark disputes.In the UK, the National Archives, a government agency, is leading a campaign to encourage businesses to set up archives. The initiative has a website (www. managingbusinessarchives.co.uk) full of tips and sources of advice. But with companies under pressure to trim every budget, does the payback from conserving heritage justify the expense?HSBC appears to think so. A few years ago, the bank, which has a corporate archive in London, gave Helen Swinnerton in Hong Kong the job of developing an archive for the Asia-Pacific region. Now the bank plans to appoint other regional archivists, starting in North America. Ms Swinnerton says having an archive has allowed HSBC to emphasise its survival over the years through economic crises and even world war.Smart and outgoing, Ms Swinnerton and Ms Clapp epitomise a younger generation that challenges the stereotype of the bookish archivist in cardigan and spectacles.The new breed came on the scene in the 1990s, armed with IT skills and postgraduate degrees in archive administration and record management. Before that, most archives were run by staff enthusiasts nearing retirement, says Katey Logan, business archives consultant at Logan McCabe, who compiled the best practice website for the National Archives.The focus of the new, more professional business archivist has shifted from conserving memorabilia to advancing business goals. Ms Clapp says she has “wonderful” material on Boots’ cafés and its once famous booklovers’ libraries but, when presenting to commercial directors, she skips the historical culs-de-sac and focuses on brands that still matter, such as Soltan and No 7. “We target category managers with materials that are relevant to them,” she says.Business archivists do more than conserve ancient artefacts. Maintaining a contemporary knowledge bank is also part of the job. Wolfgang Wimmer, archivist at Carl Zeiss in Germany, has skills in modern records management as well as archive research. Two years ago, the optics company resumed production of materials microscopes after a gap of several decades. Based on the archive, the marketing team was able to say Carl Zeiss had pioneered materials microscopy.When he is not researching, Mr Wimmer is out in the business recording how its strategy and processes are changing. “In former days, archivists were only interested in the actions of the top management. But today we try to have an example of every process in which the business engages — even ones that are very banal such as how the company buys pencils.”How do archivists handle the discovery of skeletons in the cupboard? Businesses are not obliged to disclose their archives. But researchers who stumble upon gaps in the historical record draw their own conclusions.When researching explosions at oil refineries, Christopher McKen­na, a reader in business history and strategy at the Said Business School at Oxford University, encountered an oil company that appeared to have gone 50 years without a single accident. “It told me that somebody had literally gone through and removed any reference [to accidents],” he says. Rather than suppress controversial material, Mr McKenna ad­vises businesses to do as German groups did after 1945, and open their archives to historical scrutiny: “If you don’t have records, you cannot defend yourself.”Mr Wimmer laments that in their enthusiasm for “everything new” businesses may scorn history. But as they grapple with re­cession, some are consulting the past. When the downturn started, Coca-Cola’s archivist Phil Mooney revealed that during the Great Depression the company had increased spending on marketing and profited. “The discovery helped persuade senior managers to cut budgets in administration to buy more advertising. The marketing guys liked that message.”Procter & Gamble archivist Ed Rider says he often helps P&G “remember what it already knows”. The group’s marketers recently reused a graphic device, invented in the 1990s, to illustrate how a liquid laundry detergent was made more compact.But it is not just successes that merit study – flops and failures are often instructive too (see panel below).For the future, digitisation is “the big issue that keeps [archivists] awake”, says Mr Mooney. When he started at Coke, the oldest documents in the archive were as easy to read as the newest. Now, documents stored electronically must be converted to a new format, printed or binned each time the technology changes.Come the recovery, archivists will try to persuade bosses to restore budgets and headcounts for their work. Some will look at ways of making money from their collections. John Lewis, the UK retailer, already licenses designs from its textiles archive. Coca-Cola licenses historical advertising images. These commercial arrangements generate revenue and promote the brand.The case for business archives goes far beyond licensing opportunities, however. An archive is the memory of a company, the embodiment of its culture and a source of marketing and product ideas. The payback from an archive may not be instantly measurable. But, as Ms Clapp points out: “The impact on [business performance] can be huge.”
235;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-08-03T08:26:16Z;Debt’s all she wrote;Still time to stop debt bomb from exploding;"Four hundred billion dollars will buy you the entire annual economic output of Taiwan, or two Irelands. It is also the amount of debt that needs to be repaid over the next five years by private equity-owned companies. Having leveraged up fast during the boom, they now need to deleverage almost as quickly.There is still time to stop this debt bomb from exploding in the industry’s face. Only $21bn of the total amount matures over the next two years. Meanwhile, for those borrowers who can not convince their lenders to extend maturities, there are other options.Follow-on equity injections, although they dilute returns, can reduce the debt quantum; Terra Firma plans to pump £300m into music company EMI. Buying back debt is another possibility, and a good one for those that can afford it; Alliance Boots has bought back £400m of its debt at 70 per cent of face value. Then there is the high-yield bond market, which has exploded into life for public companies. Refinancing, however, requires consent from current lenders, and can be expensive. Privately-held Virgin Media’s recent refinancing included a €180m issue on which it will pay a hefty 9.5 per cent coupon.The alternative is to raise funds through partial or complete exits. There is some sign the IPO market may be creaking open, but probably only for companies that have been able to grow earnings through the downturn. Another is to pass the parcel to another private equity firm. Preqin, a research outfit, estimates the industry still has some $1,000bn of mostly uncalled commitments they could spend on distressed sales. A final option is to sell to a trade buyer. Having been priced out of deals during the boom, it would be sweet revenge for these non-financial buyers if they picked up those same assets at a fraction of the original sale price.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

236;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-07-26T23:46:50Z;Bidding buddies need a pre-nup;;Get a room!Everywhere you look, a love-in between private equity and trade bidders seems to be taking place.During the debt boom, buyout funds took enormous pleasure in using leverage to outbid strategic players for the best assets.But now, under pressure to do deals without cheap credit, private equity has little choice but to play nice with their arch-rivals.Earlier this month, the media group Bertelsmann created a joint venture with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts designed to speed growth of its music rights management business.Now, CVC has joined forces with the Cosmen family of Spain to try to acquire National Express, the UK bus and train operator.Although National Express has rejected the CVC-Cosmen initial offer, the concept behind such consortiums makes perfect sense, combining the dealmaking expertise of a buyout group with the strategic knowlege of an industry player.These joint bids become even more interesting when one partner is also the largest shareholder as the Cosmens are with an 18.7 per cent stake in National Express.Having an insider on board should help if they choose to make a new bid.That’s what KKR was banking on when it joined forces with Stefano Pessina in 2007 to take Alliance Boots private in Europe’s biggest-ever leveraged buyout.As deputy chairman of the drugs wholesaler and retail pharmacy chain as well as the company’s largest shareholder, Mr Pessina played a key role in swinging the deal for KKR.The trouble with such couplings comes not at the start but at the end of their relationship when it’s time to exit the investment, and this is what trade and buyout groups must be clear on when forming bidding consortums.Industry buyers tend to want to keep growing a company, reorganising its business lines and capital structure rather than selling out.Private equity groups, on the other hand, try to sell their investments within three to five years of acquiring them, and return the profits to their limited partners.To this end, investors in such consortiums must ensure that buyout groups have negotiated watertight “drag-along” clauses with their strategic partners.This equivalent of a pre-nuptial agreement will make clear which partner has control over when to sell out and at what price.Without it, these trendy new unions can quickly become shams.lina.saigol@ft.com
237;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-06-24T18:29:39Z;KKR drops plans for NYSE flotation;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts abandoned plans for a New York Stock Exchange flotation on Wednesday, as the private equity group opted instead to give itself an Amsterdam public listing.KKR had planned to merge its operations with those of KKR Private Equity Investors (KPE), its Euronext Amsterdam-listed fund, and then list the entire operation on the NYSE.However, in a statement on Wednesday, KKR announced a revised plan for combining KKR and KPE, under which the Amsterdam listing would be retained.Under the new plan, KKR would give existing KPE shareholders 30 per cent of the combined entity, up from the 21 per cent they would have received under its initial plan. KPE would retain its Amsterdam listing.KKR partners would end up with 70 per cent of the shares. As part of the proposal, the US private equity group run by Henry Kravis and George Roberts is expected to withdraw its application to list on the NYSE.KKR has received assurances of support from a group of the eight largest shareholders, representing 44 per cent of its shares, including Black River Asset Management, Lexington Partners, Putnam Investments and Templeton Global Advisors.The independent directors of KPE, which have three of its five board seats, are now considering the matter.For most of KPE’s existence, the listed entity has been a source of frustration for KKR because the market price of its shares fell below the values the private equity group assigned to the companies in the KPE portfolio.Once the deal is approved, KKR will effectively be taking back a share of these deals – including Energy Future Holdings, aTexas utility, and the Alliance Boots UK pharmacy chain – at what it considers a bargain price.Meanwhile, investors in KPE will receive shares in KKR itself, gaining a stake in all of KKR’s businesses and fees, rather than just holdings in some of the companies KKR owns.By remaining on Euronext, KKR will avoid the lengthy registration process and governance requirements of the NYSE. The existing Euronext investors have the right to require the company to seek a New York listing a year after the new deal closes.New York has the advantage of greater liquidity, making it more attractive for shareholders. KKR itself has said it doesn’t intend to cash out as part of any listing.KPE first listed three years ago for $25 a share, raising $5bn in the process. Since then, it like other private equity firms has been hard hit by the meltdown in the credit market and the recession.At the end of 2008, KKR marked down by half the value of its investments, reflecting the downturn in the public markets, although many of KKR’s portfolio biggest companies in the US are relatively less vulnerable to economic hard times than many of its competitors.After the FT reported the outlines of the plan, the shares have moved up. On Wednesday, they closed at $5.70, almost treble their March low.
238;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-06-24T17:50:21Z;Investors fear banks will return to old ways;;UK investors and professional services groups say they are concerned that buoyant equity markets will allow the City of London to wriggle away from the consequences of the global financial crisis without making fundamental changes.Critics of the City argue that the good times are already starting to roll again on the back of the bumper fees big banks are making from rights issues. They point to bidding wars erupting in the race to secure the services of top bankers, analysts and corporate brokers. Plans by Citigroup, UBS and Merrill Lynch to raise base salaries are also cited.On Tuesday, Lord Turner, the head of the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator, said he had noticed a resumption of “aggressive hiring” of traders by investment banks, suggesting a return to irresponsible pay deals and “business as usual”.Bankers and brokers reject that view. Denizens of the Square Mile argue they have made crucial root-and-branch adjustments to their risk management, pay and business practices in the wake of last autumn’s collapse of Lehman Brothers.However, to Richard Saunders, chairman of the Investment Management Association, the anti-bank critique is compelling. Mr Saunders says: “I’ve become increasingly concerned that the banking sector is too keen to move on. It’s important that we [do] not lose sight of the enormity of what has gone on and that changes have to be made.”Feelings are also running high about the £9.6m potential pay-out for Stephen Hester, the newly appointed head of Royal Bank of Scotland, and the decision by Alliance Boots, the retail chain, to hire Andy Hornby, who led HBOS into its forced merger with Lloyds TSB and is accused in some quarters of being one of the key architects of the UK banking crisis.Steve Priddy, technical director of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, says the hiring of Mr Hornby “tells me a lot about City ethics. There is a sense of the tide going out. There are some really big issues that should not be allowed to go away”.Investors find it particularly galling that banks are doing so well from rights issues, in effect helping wounded companies recuperate after a bank-led crisis. Peter Montagnon, director of investment affairs at the Association of British Insurers, says: “It could look as though the recession is over for them.“There is a risk that if the investment banking market turns, it will be much harder to put in place and enforce sensible reforms.”Bankers and brokers disagree sharply, however. They point out that many of their groups are still cutting headcount and reducing their use of leverage. While making money remains a key goal in the City, banks are keeping a far closer eye on long-term risks and rewards, and many are openly preparing for a regulatory crackdown.Andy Stewart, chief executive of Cenkos Securities, says: “With the markets being better, there is a sense of enthusiasm again. But it is all relative. The nonsense of 18 months ago, when people who couldn’t add numbers [were commanding] huge bonuses – hopefully we’ll never see that again.”While Barclays and Nomura, among others, are out hiring and some big banks are raising salaries to compete, the focus is almost entirely on equities and corporate finance, areas that are subject to less onerous capital requirements.By contrast, there is almost no demand for experts in structured products, the area that got most of the banks into trouble.Lorna Tilbian, executive director of Numis Securities, says: “Lord Turner is right that human nature hasn’t changed. It hasn’t changed since Adam and Eve. What has changed are the fundamentals and the balance sheet.”Even pay packages are quite different than they were at the height of the boom. Angela Knight, the chief executive of the British Bankers’ Association, says: “Current remuneration packages all have a lock-in mechanism that rewards only on the basis of long-term performance for shareholders, taxpayers and customers of a bank.“They are very different from the cash-based bonus schemes based on one-year performance that were commonplace before the failure of Lehman Brothers.”Some City observers also say they think it is probably better in the long run to wait until tempers cool before bringing about any regulatory changes.Tim Ambler, senior marketing fellow at the London Business School, says: “These crises only happen every 60 years or so, so the rush to do something is rather foolish. We’ve got another 59 years to get it right.”Additional reporting by Patrick Jenkins
239;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-06-18T17:27:59Z;Americans show a sense of humour with Deutsche;;So much for the punditry that Uncle Sam would not look beyond US investment banks in choosing advisers for the initial public offering of the Asian life assurance unit of American International Group.The $5bn-plus Hong Kong listing of American International Assurance will throw off hundreds of millions of dollars in advisory fees, large chunks of which will go to Morgan Stanley and, er, Deutsche Bank.Morgan Stanley was considered a shoo-in, given it is advising the US Federal Reserve on the rescue of the stricken US insurer. The Americans showed they do have a sense of humour by adding the German bank as a joint global co-ordinator – ahead of Goldman Sachs and Citigroup.Deutsche Bank has made several high-profile hirings this year and AIG has been impressed by the bank’s advice on some of its myriad regional divestments. Spurned candidates are left to lick deep wounds before lobbying for less lucrative advisory roles, including book runner.UBS and Merrill Lynch, tellingly, failed to make the shortlist for last week’s final interviews. Credit Suisse bankers will scratch their heads and wonder how a European rival edged them aside.AIA lacks a comparator group: no company comes close to its size and scale in Asia. The American taxpayer will hope it has chosen advisers wisely, given that investor education could be the key to a blockbuster listing.TPG eyes windfallTPG, the US private equity group, stands to make a lot more money on its planned sale of a Chinese bank to Ping An Insurance than originally expected, but only if the deal is approved by regulators.Based on initial information provided by Shenzhen Development Bank, the medium-sized national lender that TPG controls through a 17 per cent stake, the Financial Times initially reported that TPG would make a profit on its five-year investment of at least 150 per cent by selling that stake to Chinese insurance giant Ping An.But, based on subsequent information provided by SDB, it appears TPG actually stands to earn at least $1.38bn, a 460 per cent return on its initial investment of about $300m. The much higher estimate comes from the fact that TPG and other shareholders were handed dividend shares in SDB as part of China’s state-owned share reform programme between 2005 and 2007, with TPG in essence receiving 120m SDB shares for free.If TPG chooses to take Hong Kong-listed Ping An shares instead of cash for its SDB stake, its mark-to-market profit would be more like 580 per cent, based on Ping An’s latest share price.A return of at least 460 per cent over five years is impressive, especially in a market and region where private equity investors have a troubled history.But the deal may prove too good to be true as regulatory opposition in Beijing is already building.Sir Fred’s redemptionIn a few cultures, showing remorse is sufficient to win redemption. When it comes to discredited chief executives, an additional step is required: reimbursement.Sir Fred Goodwin’s decision to reduce his pension – months after he stepped down in disgrace as chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland – will be analysed as much for the quantity of the gesture as for its quality.As Sir Philip Hampton, RBS’s chairman, said on Thursday, the cut in Sir Fred’s annual pension from £703,000 ($1.15m) to £342,500 “on any measure …represents a very substantial reduction”.On behalf of its taxpayer-investors, RBS is right to have haggled and accepted Sir Fred’s offer, rather than pursuing the former boss expensively through the courts for the rest.But “on any measure” £342,500 (plus the lump sum that Sir Fred had already accepted) still looks a substantial amount for a man who helped drive RBS into the hands of government.RBS staff, whose average salary is less than £21,000, might complain that the pain of exile from Edinburgh’s salon society is more than compensated by a six-figure annual payment to do nothing.Contractually, Sir Fred is entitled to his full pension. But Sir Fred should have offered to take a cut earlier. Andy Hornby, Sir Fred’s counterpart at HBOS, has been given a second chance as chief of privately owned pharmacy group Alliance Boots. Mr Hornby, like Sir Fred, apologised for his role in his bank’s near-collapse.

240;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-06-18T17:20:29Z;Sir Fred’s RBS pension compromise comes too late;;In a few cultures, showing remorse is sufficient to win redemption.

RBS staff, whose average salary is less than £21,000, might easily complain that the pain of exile from Edinburgh’s salon society and the loss of reputation are more than compensated by a six-figure annual payment to do nothing.Of course, contractually, Sir Fred is entitled to his full pension. The internal RBS inquiry into his conduct revealed no legal reason for curtailing his retirement benefits. But that did not seem to be a factor in February, when, declining to hand back any of his pension entitlement, Sir Fred himself told the government that further acts of atonement were “not warranted”.That was a mistake. Contract or no contract, inquiry or no inquiry, Sir Fred should have offered to take a cut in his pension earlier, if only to lessen the pressure on him and his beleaguered family.

Its rights issue has some similarities with the last one it launched – in 1983 – which was timed to take advantage of a rising share price and the first signs of recovery. The latest £423m issue is largely defensive. It should stave off a need to refinance loan facilities expensively and on onerous terms, and prevent a logjam of maturing debt in 2012.But Sir Kevin Smith, GKN’s chief executive, like his counterparts at Sainsbury, Resolution or Marston’s, is also in search of opportunities. GKN is looking to pluck contracts from the hands of hard-pressed rivals, just as Sainsbury and Marston’s are after property or development sites at knock-down prices and Resolution is hunting for insurance assets that it can restructure.Their attitude seems to give the lie to an RSA/Future Foundation survey this week, which warned of risk aversion sweeping Britain because of “a lack of available finance, a lack of confidence in future economic prospects, a concern that investors are also averse to risk-taking, a desire to follow the example of others and even our inherent British conservatism”.In reality, once GKN and Marston’s have raised the funds, they will have the luxury of choosing how risk-averse they should be. Either they can become unlikely blue-chip vultures in the recessionary desert, or, if the economy stays in the doldrums, they can use the provisions they have stockpiled to outlast those rivals that didn’t take advantage of the narrow window for equity issuance.andrew.hill@ft.comTo comment, visit www.ft.com/lombard
241;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-06-15T19:20:38Z;‘Double whammy’ effect hits BT;;BT, sponsor of Britain’s largest pension scheme, shocked investors last month by revealing that it would have to increase annual contributions to its pension scheme to £525m for each of the next three years, up from its current rate of £280m.The sum, equal to almost a quarter of the telecom­munications company’s projected free cash flow, stems from an agreement struck with scheme trustees in late 2006 that is legally binding.The deal, known as a “true up/true down” agreement, requires BT to increase contributions if the investment returns on the scheme’s portfolio are less than 3.2 per cent annually, adjusted for inflation.John Ralfe, an independent pensions consultant who famously moved investments in the Alliance Boots pension scheme entirely into bonds when he was corporate treasurer there, says that such agreements can be a “double whammy”.That is because a scheme that invests heavily in risky assets will find that the economic conditions likely to give rise to poor performance are also likely to create tough trading conditions for the employer.As a result, the employer is unlikely to be able to increase its contributions.BT, which not only has heavy weightings in equities but also in hedge funds and commodities, has not said whether it will revise its investment strategy.Although it referred questions about investments to the manager of the scheme, current rules require both the employer and the scheme trustee to agree a strategy.
242;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-06-10T22:12:52Z;PZ Cussons looks to clean up in Nigeria;;When Imperial Leather soap was introduced into the UK in the late 1930s by Paterson Zochonis, scented with a fragrance commissioned by a Russian Count from London perfumers Bayleys, the company was already well-established in West Africa.Almost 80 years later, Nigeria is the single most important contributor of revenues and the fastest-growing part of the group, whose origins date back to the 1870s when Scot George Henry Paterson and Greek George Basil Zochonis set up a trading post in Sierra Leone.Chief executive Alexander Kanellis has big plans for the Nigerian operations. PZ Cussons, as the group is now known, is trying to develop the retailing sector in Nigeria so that it can more easily sell its refrigerators, microwaves, televisions and air conditioners – sold under the brand “Haier Thermocool” (a joint venture with China’s Haier Group) – to the country’s expanding middle class.“There is no modern retail trade at all,” claims Mr Kanellis, who became chief executive in 2006 after more than a decade in brand and regional management jobs with the company in Nigeria, Indonesia and Thailand.PZ Cussons opened its first “HT Cool World” retail store in Lagos two years ago, after introducing electrical goods to the country in the mid-1970s. There are now five stores in three cities, including Abuja and Kano. Before it started opening the stores, through which it sells less than 3 per cent of its white goods, traders would go into its depots and buy goods on credit before selling them in the open market or small shops.In a trading statement on Wednesday, PZ Cussons eased analysts concerns about weakness in the Nigerian economy following declines in the value of the Naira against the US dollar and sterling.It stressed that trading in its Nigerian division continued to be strong thanks to a resurgence in oil prices, which are a key driver of the Nigerian economy.Analysts are becoming increasingly confident of the company’s ability to increase its profits following investment in Nigeria and the UK.Goldman Sachs this month raised its rating on PZ Cussons from “sell” to “neutral”, noting the group’s “strong earnings growth outlook, especially in Africa”. Its shares, which on Wednesday gained 1¼p to 180¾p, have risen 23 per cent over the past six months, outperforming the FTSE 100, which is up 3 per cent.Mr Kanellis foresees more than a decade of growth for PZ Cussons in Nigeria, where it is the leading supplier of refrigerators and freezers, claiming that of the country’s 22m households, only 40 per cent own refrigerators. He argues that the remaining households will buy refrigerators as electricity becomes more widely available, although the company has moved to widen the target market for electrical goods by selling generators.PZ Cussons also supplies cleaning products, and Mr Kanellis says that rising incomes bode well for sales of its laundry detergent brands, such as Zip and Jet. “As people get richer they wash their clothes every day,” he says.The company is also building a UHT milk factory in Nigeria to strengthen its nutrition business. It already has one factory making powdered and evaporated milk following a joint venture, Nutricima, with Glanbia in 2003. Analysts say the venture, which has been losing money in part due to record high global milk prices, is expected to make a small profit this year.Africa (mostly Nigeria but also Ghana and Kenya) accounts for 46 per cent of group revenues, and 34 per cent of its operating profits. Its European business – mostly the UK – contributes more than half of its profits.In the UK, PZ Cussons’ £75m purchase of the Sanctuary Spa brand – which sells body care products through retailer Boots – from HG Capital last year helped boost sales over Christmas. Analysts say that Sanctuary is attracting consumers who are trading down from more expensive products.The family-controlled company (the Zochonis family retains a 51 per cent stake) is hoping a new £26m “personal wash centre of excellence”, opened in February at its headquarters on the outskirts of Manchester, will improve the quality and range of its products, which include Carex handwash and Original Source shower gels. It wants to develop more “natural” products, as well as ranges targeted at young people.
243;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-06-09T22:54:32Z;Tories attack ‘revolving door’ jobs;;The Conservative party has attacked the “revolving door” that enables former ministers from Westminster to take on lucrative private-sector careers linked to their old departments.“It’s not right that former government ministers are cashing in on their positions so soon after leaving office,” Greg Hands, shadow Treasury minister, told the Financial Times last night.“They may have all lost confidence in [Gordon] Brown, but that isn’t a reasonable excuse for making money from their former positions.”However, Labour MPs accused the Tories of hypocrisy, given the plethora of second jobs enjoyed by the Conservative front bench, and pointed out that David Cameron was forced to abandon a proposed ban on shadow ministers taking such jobs in the face of a threatened revolt.“It’s a bit rich the Tories are saying [we suffer from] conflicts of interest, given the pies they’ve got their fingers in,” said Adam Ingram, a former armed forces minister now earning more than £145,000 a year from board positions and consultancies.Mr Ingram flatly rejected any suggestion that his employment by companies such as EDS, which have contracts with the Ministry of Defence, conflicted with his previous government position. “These jobs have nothing to do with what I was doing as armed forces minister. There’s no point of conflict and if there had been, I would not have taken on the arrangements,” he said.Patricia Hewitt, who will step down as an MP at the next general election, pointed out that there was a system to prevent conflicts of interest from arising.Ms Hewitt, a former health secretary, has a six-figure portfolio of outside work that includes acting as a consultant for Alliance Boots, the retail pharmacy chain, and a senior adviser to Cinven, the private equity firm that bought Bupa hospitals in 2007.“My appointments were all approved by the independent advisory committee on ministerial appointments,” she said. “I do not believe that there are any conflicts of interest, and neither would I allow them to occur.”Mr Ingram admitted that “people can be cynical about the vetting process” that prevents former ministers and civil servants from cashing in on their tax­payer-funded role. The advisory committee has in the past complained of certain former ministers seeking its advice on proposed jobs too late – or even not at all.The minimum period required between leaving government and starting a new job has also been criticised. One tabloid news-paper scoffed that cabinet ministers “must wait a whole three months after stepping down before burying their snouts in the private sector trough”.Despite many Labour MPs now fearing for their future at the next general election, Mr Ingram said they had not sought his advice. He said: “People may say things to me about, ‘You seem to be doing well.’ But no one’s come to me and said, ‘Can you get me a job?’ . . . I’m not an employment centre for ex-ministers.”
244;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-06-08T19:35:34Z;Lombard: HBOS’s Hornby gets a last shot at rehabilitation;;"When Sir Tom McKillop retired as a director of BP, some fans said that a fine non-executive was sacrificing himself unnecessarily to appease investors offended by his lamentable record as chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland.The bold decision by privately held Alliance Boots, the drugs wholesaler and retail pharmacy chain, to hire Andy Hornby raises the same issues, from the other direction. If Sir Tom was tainted by RBS, why aren’t Mr Hornby’s prospects crippled by his role in leading HBOS to the brink of disaster? Alternatively, if Mr Hornby can resurrect his career, should Sir Fred Goodwin brush off his CV?Alliance Boots wants Mr Hornby not for what he knows about banking, but for what he knows about retailing. He used to be a senior manager at Asda and he was better at retail banking than corporate lending, HBOS’s Achilles heel. There is certainly more to the charge that Sir Tom, former boss of AstraZeneca, was a pharmacist trying to lead a bank, than there will be to the charge that Mr Hornby is a banker trying to run a pharmacy.But it’s still hard to set aside the latter’s record at HBOS. The fateful transformation of the bank from safe mutual to racy lender happened before he took over. But Mr Hornby was chief executive for the critical two-and-a-half years until January (and chief operating officer before that). Thousands of HBOS staff left jobless following the emergency takeover by Lloyds won’t want him to get a second chance. Former HBOS investors will also take some convincing Mr Hornby is an asset, if Alliance Boots is sold back to the public markets.But for now, those groups don’t get to decide on Mr Hornby’s future; Stefano Pessina and KKR, who took Alliance Boots private in 2007, do. Unlike institutional investors in BP, who judged Sir Tom to be a potential liability, they can take a calculated risk on Mr Hornby. He is certainly a far more likely candidate for rehabilitation than some of his peers. He has apologised and shown integrity by giving up additional pension payments. At 42, and having ploughed his bonuses into HBOS shares, he is hungry for redemption.But Mr Hornby should not count on rebuilding his reputation on the quiet. Boots is a linchpin of the High Street. The whole group employs 115,000 people. It was bought out at the peak of the credit cycle, under intense political scrutiny. Messing up this job won’t threaten the financial system, but it would definitively end Mr Hornby’s management career. So, Andy: one last crack at the big time. Sir Fred – no need to dry-clean the pinstripes.Jeroen van der Veer is an honourable man, so it wouldn’t do to call into question his motive in calling for changes to the way executives are rewarded. But the Royal Dutch Shell boss – whose own pay was criticised at his last shareholder meeting – is still guilty of pulling up the ladder behind him. Sad though it may be, his long experience makes him an unlikely – and probably doomed – reformer.He starts with the disadvantage that he has enjoyed the fruits of the system. Remuneration committees are mainly populated by directors who have benefited from the decisions of such committees at their own companies. The suggestion Mr van der Veer can use them as the launchpad for his campaign is as credible as MPs starting a movement for expenses reform from a floating duck-house.Assume, however, Mr van der Veer does manage to mount a campaign. Having declared his hand, he will surely find his efforts cut short. As Warren Buffett, the US investor and arch-critic of pay without performance, pointed out a few years ago: “I’ve been on 19 boards and only been on compensation committees once – at Salomon [the investment bank]. They outvoted me two to one.”Mike Ashley’s first attempt to sell Newcastle United was launched with a magnificently emotional letter to fans and a price tag of £300m ($481m) last September. That sale was abandoned in December, but relegation has now forced the Sports Direct founder to knock the asking price down to a mere £100m.This time, all potential buyers get is a terse five-line statement and a contact e-mail (it’s believed extra server space has not been booked to cope with the increased e-mail traffic). The new price is roughly a 60 per cent discount to what the king of pile-’em-high, sell-’em-cheap retailing paid for the club and has since invested in it. That must be painful, but Mr Ashley is famous for knowing his price-points. Is it coincidence, or clever corporate finance, that Sportsdirect.com is currently applying the same discount to Newcastle’s old Premiership strip?"
245;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-06-08T19:22:09Z;Boots job will leave Hornby well-heeled;;Andy Hornby, former chief executive of HBOS, could be paid about £800,000 ($1.2m) a year in his new role as chief executive of Alliance Boots.People familiar with the situation said Mr Hornby, who was confirmed as group chief executive of the private-equity owned retail and drugs distribution group on Monday, would be paid a basic salary of about £400,000, rising to about £800,000 including annual bonus.This would be in line with the remuneration of Ornella Barra, who leads the wholesale pharmaceuticals division, and Alex Gourlay, chief executive of the health and beauty division.Stefano Pessina, executive chairman, teamed up with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts to take Alliance Boots private in Europe’s biggest buy-out two years ago.Mr Hornby, whose reputation was badly damaged when HBOS came to near collapse last year, will also join the so-called management equity plan.Like more than 100 other senior managers across the group, he will invest his own money in “sweet equity” – ordinary shares that can pay out big profits if the company is sold for a profit, but suffer the first loss if it fails.A person familiar with Alliance Boots said of Mr Hornby’s appointment: “We have taken on the potential PR impact of this. But we think he is a world class chief executive. He perhaps didn’t play a perfect hand at HBOS, but he deserves a second chance.”He added: “We would rather go for the best, even with baggage, than settle for a safe pair of hands without any baggage.”Mr Hornby’s experience of running a FTSE 100 company could prove handy for Alliance Boots, which KKR and Mr Pessina plan to float when markets recover.Alliance Boots said that Mr Hornby would become group chief executive on July 1.www.ft.com/lombard
246;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-06-08T03:08:42Z;Fidelity teams up with KKR in listings deal;;Mutual fund group Fidelity is teaming up with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm, in an unusual deal that will give Fidelity’s huge retail client base access to future public listings of KKR-owned and underwritten companies.The exclusive arrangement will give KKR guaranteed retail distribution for its initial public offerings, and will allow Fidelity to offer its brokerage customers an equity investment they might not find elsewhere.It is the first such deal between a fund group and a buy-out firm, although Fidelity has had similar arrangements in the past with investment banks, most recently with JPMorgan.KKR owns almost 50 companies, including Hospital Corp of America, Dollar General, First Data, SunGard, the former TXU, a Texas utility, and Alliance Boots.There have been virtually no IPOs in the past two years, but as conditions and sentiment improve in the stock market, KKR and its peers are expected to list many of the companies they bought in the boom years.Mark Haggerty, the head of Fidelity’s capital markets group, told the Financial Times: “The KKR guys initiated it and we thought it was a great idea . . . we have massive distributive powers.”Under the deal, when KKR underwrites an IPO, it will give Fidelity’s 12m brokerage customers exclusive access to buy the retail shares KKR is allocated from the IPO. Broker/dealer customers of Fidelity, which collectively employ 85,000 brokers, will be able to receive the shares for their customers alongside Fidelity’s 3,500 investment advisers. Fidelity would receive a fee as part of the selling group for the IPO.The deal with Fidelity represents a step forward in KKR’s plan to build a capital markets business that will partly free it from dependence on Wall Street.KKR has gone a long way to sourcing its own deals rather than relying on ideas from investment banks and buying through auction processes, when prices tend to be steep.
247;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-06-07T18:13:20Z;Hornby to take helm at Alliance Boots;;Andy Hornby (pictured below), the former chief executive of HBOS, is set to become the chief executive of Alliance Boots, in a move that could enable him to restore his standing.Mr Hornby’s reputation was badly damaged when HBOS came to the brink of collapse last year when the financial crisis was at its height.An announcement on his appointment as chief executive of the drugs and cosmetics retailer could come early this week. Alliance Boots confirmed Mr Hornby was “a leading candidate” in its search.Mr Hornby’s management experience from Asda, the supermarket chain, has been a significant factor in discussions with Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, during the past four weeks.The company, which has a large wholesale pharmaceuticals business as well as its chain of chemists, is trading through the worst recession in a generation.Mr Pessina will retain his role but he is looking to spend more time on strategy and less on day-to-day running of the company.In an interview with the Financial Times in April, he said he still had an appetite for “transformational deals”.The position of chief executive at Alliance Boots has been vacant since the departure of Richard Baker in 2007, shortly after the company was placed in private hands.Mr Pessina teamed up with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity group, to pull off the £11bn takeover. It was Europe’s largest buy-out.This month KKR said it was writing down the value of its stake from $2.1bn to $1.4bn (£877m).Alliance Boots reported sales of £20.5bn in the year to March 31, up 16 per cent, and pre-tax profit of £13m, compared with a loss of £64m in 2007-08.Since Mr Baker’s departure, Mr Pessina has relied on the heads of the company’s two main divisions. Ornella Barra and Alex Gourlay lead the company’s wholesale pharmaceuticals, and health and beauty businesses respectively.Mr Pessina is also testing whether the Boots brand, already prominent in the Irish Republic and Thailand, can be used in the Netherlands and Norway.If Mr Hornby takes the chief executive role at Alliance Boots, it will be at the second time of asking.In 2003, HBOS increased his pay after Boots approached him for the top job. Three years later, Mr Hornby became one of the youngest FTSE 100 chief executives by succeeding Sir James Crosby at HBOS.After the lender’s near-collapse in September last year, HBOS was saved through a £12bn takeover by Lloyds TSB, following intense efforts by the government to find a buyer.
248;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-06-01T12:23:51Z;Loss of $1.2bn for KKR after falls in value;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts reported a $1.2bn (£730m) loss for 2008, as some of the private equity group’s biggest investments fell in value, including First Data, the credit card processing group, and Alliance Boots, the pharmacy chain.In a surprise investor update on Sunday night, KKR announced sharp drops in the value of portfolios in the four funds it has raised since 2002.The private equity group said its total assets under management shrank from $53.2bn to $48.5bn last year, as a string of big writedowns took their toll.The group, run by Henry Kravis and his cousin George Roberts, said it still had $15.4bn of “dry powder”, or uninvested capital, to spend on new deals.It had $6.2bn of “dry powder” in Europe, $6.1bn in the US and $3.1bn in Asia. It added that it had an “increased focus on international and emerging markets, such as Asia and Middle East”.Last month, the group completed Asia’s largest leveraged buy-out for two years, spending $1.8bn to buy Oriental Brewery, the South Korean beer company, from Anheuser-Busch InBev.It recently opened a subsidiary in Dubai and hired Ford Fraker, the former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, as an adviser to help it expand in the Middle East.In Asia, KKR is rumoured to be vying with other private equity groups to acquire as much as 20 per cent of China’s fast-growing Gome electronics retail chain.However, the financial crisis and deepening global recession took their toll on several of the big US and European investments in KKR’s portfolio.It wrote its $2.3bn equity investment in First Data down to $1.4bn at the end of March. Its $2.1bn stake in Alliance Boots was cut to $1.4bn, though this was partly due to the weaker pound, as the pharmacy chain’s earnings are still growing.Elsewhere, KKR reported some positive moves, such as its stake in Dollar General, the US discount retailer, which it wrote up 30 per cent to $1.3bn, and Legrand, the French electrical equipment maker, which rose threefold to $1.3bn.However, other big fallers included stakes in Energy Future Holdings, the Texas electricity utility formerly called TXU, which dropped by half to $908m, and US Foodservice, the food distribution company, which fell by a fifth to $798m.The worst performer of the four funds KKR has raised in the past five years is its $5.7bn 2005 European fund, which has been written down by half and returned less than a 10th of the fund to investors.The New York-based group’s total fee income fell from $872m in 2007 to $640m last year, even though its management fees increased from $300m to $488m.
249;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-05-31T16:52:57Z;Signs of life in distressed debt trade;;Distressed debt trading has risen sharply in recent weeks as bankers and investors take the opportunity of rising loan and bond prices to quit difficult situations.While the opaque and secretive nature of trading in the loans and bonds of troubled companies makes trading data hard to come by, some bankers say they have seen volumes double or triple, and European loan prices have risen by a third from autumn lows.However, the increase may not last. If prices become too rich, they could scare off the so-called vulture funds, which specialise in investing in and restructuring, as well as revitalising, troubled companies.Typically, when a company begins to become financially distressed, bondholders and bank debt holders start looking for opportunities to sell their debt claims before the situation deteriorates further.But the collapse in companies’ debt values that followed the credit crisis has left many bonds and loans with market values well below their nominal worth.Even Alliance Boots or Debenhams loans, which have been performing relatively well, are quoted at about 70 per cent of face value.The fire sale prices made many banks reluctant to offload toxic assets, including the debt of failing and failed companies. They fear that crystalising their losses would frighten investors and regulators and fuel demands that they raise fresh capital.Now there are signs the market could be thawing. The average bid of the most-traded risky European loans have enjoyed a 10-week rally. They are quoted at levels not seen since before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September, according to Standard & Poor’s.“Over the past month or two, we have seen a two to threefold increase in the volume of distressed bonds and loans being traded,” says Peter Tolhurst, global co-head of distressed debt at Deutsche Bank in London.“This is coming from secondary market investors who want to take advantage of improving prices as well as banks, who have developed a more sophisticated approach to the secondary debt markets and are taking advantage of the strength of current conditions in the credit markets to manage their exposures,” he says.Activity in this relatively niche market is hard to track because trades are done privately and investors are reticent to talk about the trades they have done.One dealer estimates that there has been €4bn-€5bn (£3.5bn-£4.4bn) in distressed debt traded per month recently, up from a low of about €1.5bn.Dennis Buckley at Guy Butler, a UK broker of distressed debt, says there has been a lot more activity in recent weeks, primarily in financial sector bonds.Corporate loans have been much less liquid. Mr Buckley said that was partly because banks involved in corporate restructurings were holding on to their loan positions. “[Banks are] looking to see restructurings through and potentially sell out once the restructuring is done,” he says.Some leading European distressed debt investors say the market remains illiquid and complain of being starved of distressed paper.One investor says that, when there are loans offered in the market for sale, only a few million euros are traded at a time – not enough to build a strategic debt position in a company that would allow funds to influence or control a debt restructuring.That shortfall serves as a barrier for the many vulture funds that engage in “loan- to-own” strategies, under which, the funds buy up debt at a discount but then offer to write it off and provide vital new funds to a company in exchange for a controlling equity stake in the restructured company.But the plan works only if banks or other loan investors, such as collateralised loan obligations (structured credit funds that pool risky loans) are willing to sell in sufficient numbers. In the run-up to the crisis, CLOs were big providers of leveraged loans but now prefer to hold on to these assets rather than sell.If distressed debt trading slows down again, it could limit the ability of companies to drag themselves out of the downturn.“In any of the distressed markets I have covered, none of them have recovered until banks have been actively selling their assets,” says Deutsche’s Mr Tolhurst.Andrew Merrett, co-head of debt restructuring at Rothschild, says the lack of liquidity makes it harder for companies to get lenders to write off debt. “Many restructurings have, as a result, left companies overlevered with little additional investment, facing the risk of second-round restructuring and just being run for cash,” Mr Merrett says.While distressed debt specialists broadly expect an increase in trading later in the year once banks have repaired their balance sheets, Mr Merrett warns: “The unknown is the impact that schemes, such as the asset protection scheme in the UK, could have on those sell decisions in future.”
250;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-05-18T23:04:32Z;Quiet coup at Lloyds is a trick that’s hard to repeat;;Anthony Bolton, Fidelity’s veteran fund manager, has a new rival for the epithet “the silent assassin”: it is John Kingman, UK Financial Investments’ chief executive.Sir Victor Blank’s decision to stand down as chairman of Lloyds Banking Group, carrying the can for the merger with HBOS, followed days when the government holding company simply said nothing publicly.In no-commenting Sir Victor towards the exit, Mr Kingman and the UKFI board have managed quite a tricky balancing act. The Lloyds chairman is a friend of Gordon Brown, so UKFI appears to have asserted its independence from its government paymasters. Better still for UKFI’s credibility, the required outcome was achieved without having to vote against the chairman. On the contrary, shortly after Lloyds’ notice of Sir Victor’s decision on Sunday, UKFI issued a statement that “confirmed its support” for his re-election at the annual meeting next month. That bought Lloyds time to search for a successor and allowed UKFI to pay some diplomatic compliments to Sir Victor.But there’s a limit to how often UKFI can pull off this trick. It’s hardly surprising it is planning the sale of its bank stakes. Not only is the company’s overarching objective an “orderly and active” disposal of the shares, that is also the best way to avoid any more situations that stretch its “arm’s length” mandate until the joints crack.The whole affair has again underlined the impossibility of UKFI behaving “ like any other active, engaged shareholder”, as Mr Kingman declared it would when it was set up. The problem is that UKFI’s sheer scale – it owns 43 per cent of Lloyds and 70 per cent of Royal Bank of Scotland – and its Treasury roots limit its room for manoeuvre. In April, it did vote against the remuneration report at RBS, but generally, as a sort of Fidelity with nuclear weapons, it has to operate via innuendo and moral suasion. In the longer term, that is hard to sustain. It requires fine judgment not only of the politics of Whitehall and Westminster, but also of other shareholders’ intentions and sensibilities.The outcome in this case was the right one, but the sooner UKFI can back away from the banks, at a modest profit for the taxpayer, the better.Boots worth wearingFor a graphic illustration of how disjointed the credit markets have been, it’s hard to beat Alliance Boots’ bargain basement debt buy-back. The high-profile buy-out paid £85m for small parcels of debt with a face value of £191m, and it has continued to pick up more debt since its March 31 year-end. Such large discounts redefine what it means to be a distressed seller.A few years ago, this unconventional move might have drawn mutters from traditional lenders. First, the debt is not being extinguished but will be held in a separate company. Second, while some of the debt purchases are funded by new equity, a bit of company liquidity is also being used. This is new territory for lenders used to the world of scheduled repayments at par and pro-rata, and whose main concern is to improve their credit exposure.The facts, though, have changed and Alliance Boots has some good arguments to make. These are tiny purchases in the context of the group’s £1bn-plus of liquidity, which includes £473m of cash and cash equivalents. The lenders are also still getting their bread-and-butter repayments (including a £300m one this month).Finally, if there’s money to be made exploiting market dislocations, why shouldn’t Alliance Boots make it? Generally, where loan documents allow such debt buy-backs, it seems fair game. Lenders may not be used to companies making such investments. Then again, it would not normally be particularly attractive to buy back debt in the hope of generating private equity-style returns, even if the coupons were thrown in and there was a bit of gearing on top.With discounts as wide as they are, this is yet another bit of conventional wisdom worth testing.Blank verseVictor Blank, Victor BlankLumbered Lloyds with a deal that stank,Sold his soul for a mortgage bank.Poor old Victor Blank.Victor Blank, Victor BlankSaw other banks he could outflank,Did the deal but the shares still sank.Poor old Victor Blank.Victor Blank, Victor BlankTook the poisoned chalice and deeply drank.“Cheers,” said Gordon, “we’ve you to thank”.Poor old Victor Blank.Victor Blank, Victor Blank:Proof that pedigree, power and rankCount for nothing when markets tank.Poor old Victor Blank.andrew.hill@ft.comAlliance Boots: charis.gresser@ft.com
251;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-05-18T23:00:12Z;Alliance Boots buys back £400m debt;;Alliance Boots, the retailer that was taken private in Europe’s biggest buy-out almost two years ago, has bought back more than £400m of debt at a steep discount from distressed sellers.Stefano Pessina, the executive chairman who teamed up with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts to take Alliance Boots private, said the group had been “opportunistic” in buying back debt at less than 70p in the pound.“What happens generally is you can buy when there is a distressed fund, someone who needs the cash [or is] selling in a fire sale,” he said. “The prices look very attractive but at the end of the day, we don’t find many opportunities to buy.”George Fairweather, finance director, said Alliance Boots had bought £191m of debt in the year to March 31, giving rise to a exceptional finance gain of £106m.Since the year end, when Alliance Boots had net debt of £9bn, it had bought another £227m of debt for £142m of cash.The buybacks have been funded by Alliance Boots’ holding company, owned by Mr Pessina and KKR, including £60m from the issue of new shares.Such debt buybacks have become more common during the credit crunch. Lenders typically prefer to be repaid through formal channels at full value rather than seeing the debt repurchased in the market at a discount.The debt buyback comes as at least 100 senior managers at Alliance Boots are to do without salary increases worth millions of pounds this year to boost the pay of shop workers.However, the retailer is still examining whether to close its final salary pension scheme to existing employees. The surplus in its schemes, primarily the Boots pension scheme, fell from £297m to £188m.Alliance Boots is also cutting about 1,500 jobs in a shake-up of its pharmaceutical wholesale division, including a couple of hundred in the UK. It is adding jobs elsewhere.The health and beauty division was boosted by the performance of the Protect & Perfect range of anti-ageing creams, with Boots selling more than 1m units of a new intense beauty serum over the past 2½ weeks.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 11.3 per cent in the year to March 31 to £1.25bn. The pre-tax profit was £13m, compared with a £64m loss last time. Sales rose 15.5 per cent to £20.5bn.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture).

253;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-05-13T22:35:51Z;Ministers step up pressure on late payment;;Ministers on Wednesday pledged to ramp up the pressure on dozens of FTSE 100 companies yet to commit to paying suppliers on time, after Wednesday persuading 11 more large businesses to back a government initiative designed to help small companies survive the recession.Shriti Vadera, the business minister, told the FT that late payment was now becoming as big a problem for small businesses as the scarcity of bank lending.“There’s historical evidence to suggest late payment is one of the drivers that leads to small companies failing, so in the current climate it’s absolutely crucial,” Baroness Vadera told the FT. “Some of the companies are telling us it’s now more important for them than access to finance, which also remains an issue.”Ministerial concern over the pressure on small firms’ cashflow has been fuelled by statistics showing the average delay in companies paying bills has increased to 23 days from 20 days a year ago.The government last year pledged that Whitehall departments would pay creditors within 10 days. But attempts to spread good practice to the private sector were attacked by the Tories as a “damp squib,” after it emerged that only a handful FTSE 100 companies had signed up to a government-backed code of practice.Baroness Vadera sought to break this logjam by hosting a breakfast seminar on Wednesday, attended by 26 FTSE 100 companies. The ministerial arm twisting led to 11 more businesses signing up to the code, including Barclays, British Airways and B&Q. A further nine committed in principle to adhering to the code, including Alliance Boots, the retail chain which last year came under fire for increasing its terms from 30 to 75 days.Peter Mandelson, the business secretary, said on Wednesday he would maintain the pressure on the private sector by writing to all those companies that failed to attend his department’s summit. Government insiders argued it was too early to name and shame recalcitrant businesses, saying much of the apparently slow adherence to the code was due to logistical factors such as problems in changing IT systems.Small business representatives welcomed the government moves but called for more radical action, saying stronger legal powers were needed to prevent big companies squeezing small suppliers in the recession.“It’s very serious issue – even if large companies improve payment terms in good years, they always revert back to type during tough times,” Stephen Alambritis of the Federation of Small Businesses stated. He called for the government to instigate a French-style system of criminalising late payment, as well as giving courts greater powers to enforce payment terms.Business also wants more action to speed payments by local authorities. Only about one in three local authorities pay within the government-recommended maximum 10 days. This compares with only one in 20 paying within 10 days a year ago. But Ian Pearson, business minister, last week admitted: “There is clearly room for improvement.”
254;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-05-06T01:14:17Z;High street ‘to play ID card role’;;Boots, the pharmacy chain, and other high-street retailers could take on the processing of biometric details for new identity cards, in spite of intensifying doubts within the Labour party about the multi-billion pound scheme.Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, will use a speech on Wednesday at the CBI employers’ organisation to reaffirm the government’s commitment to the cards.She will also meet the Post Office and trade bodies such as the National Pharmacy Association, which she says have expressed an interest in their members providing the fingerprinting and photography services required for the cards and the next generation of passports.The comments will infuriate the Conservative party, which has said it would scrap the scheme if it were to win the general election next year.Chris Grayling, shadow home secretary, said on Tuesday: “The government is split down the middle [about] ID cards but it looks as if Jacqui Smith is carrying on regardless. They should abandon this farce.”Last week David Blunkett, former home secretary and architect of the ID scheme, said opponents of the cards might prefer a more limited introduction of next-generation passports, which would also hold biometric data.Objections have been raised within the cabinet about cost, particularly in light of the need to slash public spending made clear by last month’s Budget.The Home Office calculates that to introduce the scheme over the next 10 years would cost about £5bn ($8bn) for UK citizens and £379m for foreign nationals. But it argues 70 per cent of these costs would be needed anyway to introduce the next generation of biometric passports. By the plan, people would be given a choice of having an ID card and a passport or only a passport carrying biometric data.Commenting on talks with chemists and photo booth operators, Ms Smith said: “While private companies will clearly benefit from the increased footfall from offering this service, their customers will benefit from being able to quickly provide their biometrics while they are out doing the shopping.”The Home Office said on Wednesday Manchester would be the first city where people could volunteer for an ID card from the autumn. But the scheme has run into fierce opposition from pilots at Manchester airport. The Balpa pilot union says members are forced to use the card against their will and it “will resist the card with all legal means possible”.Three companies – Thales, CSC and IBM – have won contracts to provide the ID scheme and passports, with a possible £40m break-fee if the plan were to be abandoned.The ID cards will cost £30 with shops charging an additional £30 to collect data. The government claims the scheme will help to fight illegal immigration, terrorist plots and identity fraud. The cards are scheduled to be introduced nationally from 2012.
255;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-04-26T22:55:40Z;Boots considers closure of final salary pension;;Alliance Boots is considering closing its final salary scheme to existing employees, limiting the size of pension benefits that are salary linked.In an interview with the Financial Times, Stefano Pessina, executive chairman, described the existing arrangements as unfair because they give very generous benefits to a relatively small number of existing workers and much less generous retirement benefits to a larger number of others.“Most of these pension schemes have been closed many years ago. At the end of the day it is also unfair because you have a big cost to benefit a small part of your people and you could use that money to distribute the benefits to everybody in a fair way,” he said.“Is it really fair to have a big cost for a minority of employees and not to use the same money to distribute benefits to everybody?”However, Mr Pessina made it clear he was reviewing all options for the pension fund, and no decision had yet been made on whether to close the scheme to existing members.Alliance Boots has 16,000 members in its defined benefit – or final salary – scheme, compared with 4,500 in its defined contribution – or money purchase – plan. It employs 93,000 people across the world and 73,000 in the UK.Final salary pension schemes are under the spotlight as the credit crunch bites, with pension experts warning that a number of schemes will close not only to new members but also to existing members in the coming year as companies struggle to manage big pension deficits.The Pension Protection Fund estimated that pension scheme deficits in the UK were running at £155bn last November.As part of the deal to acquire Alliance Boots for £12.4bn in 2007, Mr Pessina reached an agreement with the pension trustees to continue funding the Boots pension scheme, paying £418m into the scheme over the next 10 years. The payments included an up-front payment of about £52m.In the year to March 2008, the fund had an accounting surplus of £297m.
256;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Boots looks to follow Tesco’s bank lead;;"Boots is taking a leaf out of Tesco’s book by considering a move into personal banking among a range of different services as it looks to transform itself from being a shopkeeper of shampoos and medicines to a broader business.Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of the privately owned Alliance Boots, said that while financial services was not on his immediate “to do” list, he had discussed launching these sorts of products throughout his 2,600-strong chain of pharmacies and retail stores.“We are in a market that is not growing by 20 per cent a year …the retail part, of course, and we have to add services; we have to be very active in order to offer more and more to customers and we have a lot of ideas. We are working on certain ideas.”His desire to offer new services underlines the opportunities retailers are seeing to capitalise on the public’s disillusionment with British banks, while also cashing in on the government’s desire to change the way local health services are delivered to consumers.Sir Terry Leahy, chief executive of Tesco, last week declared his ambition to create “the people’s bank”.Mr Pessina, who teamed up with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm, to take Alliance Boots private in Europe’s biggest ever buy-out deal nearly two years ago, ruled out moving into cosmetic surgery – “too difficult and too risky” – but said he had other ideas.Alliance Boots is experimenting with cervical cancer vaccinations at three stores, trialling “drive-through” pharmacies and also rolling out doctors’ surgeries in a handful of stores.The ambitions of Mr Pessina, who plans to relinquish some responsibility for running the group, resemble what Boots attempted earlier this decade when it expanded into services such as laser eye correction and beauty treatments.“My feeling is that many of the things that Boots did in the past were strategically right but the execution was not fortunate,” said Mr Pessina. “If the execution had been more accurate, probably now Boots would have a good business there. It is probably too late to go back. We have to think of different options.”"
257;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-04-26T22:37:51Z;Pessina bets his Boots on a bright future;;"For a man who less than two years ago invested £1.27bn of his personal fortune in a consumer-facing company that is now having to trade through the worst recession in a generation, Stefano Pessina seems surprisingly relaxed.In fact, as he takes his seat in the boardroom of Alliance Boots’ headquarters, perched above his flagship Boots health and beauty store on central London’s Oxford Street, the 67-year-old entrepreneur seems to be actually looking forward to talking about how his £15bn retail and drugs distribution business has fared through the financial crisis before of the publication of his annual review next month.Run through a mental checklist of potential pitfalls around Alliance Boots and you might think Mr Pessina’s easy demeanour is a bit of bravado.After all, as he surveys his 20-country empire, he does so nursing a conviction that these are the worst economic conditions he has endured during his near four-decade career.Then there is the balance sheet, still saddled with £8.7bn of debt following his £12.4bn buy-out (together with private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts) of the FTSE 100 company in 2007.It has been left with staggering finance costs – this sum ran to £853m last year – to service at a time when cash flow from the retail tills of his 2,600-strong chain of Boots chemists and beauty stores could be threatened by the downturn.Add to that a “very difficult year” for his £9.5bn wholesale business, a requirement to pay a €300m bond back next month and another tough trading year on the British high streets in 2009, and Mr Pessina could be forgiven for privately feeling a little blue.Instead he is upbeat, having delivered a “satisfactory” year in group profit and sales in spite of the economic headwinds. His wholesale business is “more or less” in positive territory – it delivered trading profit up 16 per cent to £200m in 2008. This is in spite of enduring “one of the worst years” Mr Pessina has ever seen, as the regulatory environments across the 15 markets in which he distributes drugs moved against him.His retail business, which includes 2,600 stores across the UK and another 700 pharmacies dotted across the world, had “a very good year on the whole”.“I would say retail is not as bad as we thought,” he says.“At least we have been pleasantly surprised by our sales,” he adds, before conceding that “this recession will go on for some time. I am not even sure that we have seen the bottom.”The main reason he is able to feel so relaxed is the timeframe attached to the buy-out. When KKR and Mr Pessina signed the Alliance Boots deal, they did so on the understanding that this was not going to be a quick private equity turnround and exit.Mr Pessina again stressed that he and his backers are in for the long-haul and as such will withstand a couple of rough years.He points out that while the debt burden is heavy, the bulk of the loans do not mature until 2014 and 2017 and the €300m (£271m) Eurobond that matures next month will be paid down from cash flow.The deal was also done on the understanding that KKR will not receive any dividend payments for “many years”.“If we paid out dividends we would have to reduce our growth or limit our growth and this would damage the business in the future,” he explains.“We will continue to work as a private company for many years.”He has also got some respite from punishing interest payments on the back of falling interest rates.“Maybe the return – if the conditions are tougher – will be one year later, but if we are able to grow the business to create more value, of course the return will be there.”Mr Pessina says that he will not be dramatically cutting capital expenditure across the group in the face of the downturn. Having promised to invest £1bn in Alliance Boots in the three years from acquisition, Mr Pessina invested £285m capital expenditure in the year to March 2008, much of this going on refurbishing and the rebranding of the Alliance Unichem pharmacy chains to the Boots brand.He also spent £184m on acquisitions. “We have invested quite a lot of money this year and will continue to invest next year because we have done deals to grow and to create new opportunities.”Mr Pessina acquired Depolabo, a leading provider of pharmaceutical pre-wholesale and contract logistics services in France; a 90 per cent stake in Megapharm, a specialised German distributor of oncology products; and Central Homecare, a provider of home healthcare services in the UK.Organically, he is testing whether the Boots brand – already big in Thailand and the Republic of Ireland – can gain a foothold in the Netherlands and Norway, while also rebranding the wholesale business from Alliance Unichem to Alliance Healthcare.And in the face of the credit crunch, he still has appetite for “transformational deals” should they come along.Far from treading water awaiting calmer times, Mr Pessina says he will definitely try to snap up Phoenix, the German drug wholesaler that is part of the faltering empire of Adolf Merckle, should the family decide to sell the business. The future of the company is in doubt following the suicide in January of the German billionaire.Buying Phoenix, valued according to reports at €4bn, would be another enormous deal for the multi-billionaire. But the challenge does not seem to daunt him. “I would be ready to invest with KKR,” he says.“We, the shareholders of Alliance Boots, could buy it without consolidating it into Alliance Boots. If the family decide to dispose of Phoenix we will be, for sure, interested. But we have never made an offer for the very simple reason that for the time being, Phoenix is not for sale.”"
258;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-04-14T22:31:02Z;The good, the bad and the indifferent funds;;"The valuations of buy-out funds are the best indication investors have of performance in the private equity industry, even though the final result may be very different.Figures collected by the Financial Times from institutional investors show that European buy-out funds raised during the credit boom of 2005-07 fall into three broad categories: the good, the bad and the indifferent.The bad funds include those raised in 2005 and 2006 by Terra Firma, Permira, Cognetas, Candover and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which investors marked down by 79, 54, 53, 45 and 44 per cent respectively.In some cases these figures were more bearish than the valuations that private equity groups issued to their own investors, such as Terra Firma’s markdown of 70 per cent.The difficulties of KKR, Permira and Candover are widely known because all three groups have large listed investors, that issue regular updates on the performance of their biggest investments to public shareholders.They have written down several investments to zero, as Candover has done for Ferretti, the yachtmaker, and Technogym, the fitness equipment maker, and Permira has for BorsodChem, the chemicals producer, and Valentino, the fashion group.KKR’s biggest European deal is Alliance Boots, the pharmacy chain, which was Europe’s largest leveraged buy-out when it was bought for £11.1bn ($16.5bn) in May 2007.Boots has been written down by 41 per cent, partly because of the weaker pound, but it is holding up better than many of the other European deals in KKR’s dollar-based European Fund. Several have been written down by more than 90 per cent, such as Pages Jaunes, French directories group, and NXP, the Dutch chipmaker.Investors say that there are early warning signs when a fund is running into trouble.One is “strategy drift” when a group starts investing in new areas such as cyclical or more risky industries that it has avoided in the past.KKR’s investment in NXP, a big presence in the cyclical semiconductor industry, and Permira’s purchase of Valentino, a top name in the fickle world of luxury fashion, are both examples of buy-out groups moving out of their comfort zone.In addition, investors worry when a buy-out group faces succession issues, or takes on “concentration risk” by putting too much of its fund into a single deal.Terra Firma ticks both boxes for some investors, as it is tightly owned and controlled by Guy Hands and has invested a third of its last two funds into EMI, the music group with artists such as Coldplay and Katy Perry on its roster. “What happens if Guy falls under a bus tomorrow?” asks one investor.Investors say a power struggle between Candover’s two top executives, Mark Gumienny and Colin Buffin, drove it to do ill-judged deals, such as the £1.8bn buy-out of oil services group Expro International when oil prices were at record levels.Cognetas, the successor to Electra, specialises in mid-market buy-outs that use less debt, so it should have been more immune to the credit crisis.However, it invested in some troubled areas, such as pubs, plastic surgery and printing, which hurt its latest fund.The good funds, such as CVC Capital Partners, Advent International and Axa Private Equity, invested in more defensive sectors, such as postal services, food and healthcare. They also took advantage of good times to sell some assets for high prices.The indifferent funds, which are broadly flat, included three of the biggest Nordic funds: EQT, Nordic Capital and Industri
Kapital.These have some difficult deals, such as Nordic Capital’s investment in Thule, the car roof box maker, but not enough drag them deeply into negative territory.Another indifferent fund is BC Partners’s 2005 fund, which was marked down 22 per cent, as difficult deals such as Foxtons, the London estate agent, and Dometic, the caravan accessories maker, offset better deals, such as Brenntag, the chemicals group.Ultimately, it is hard for any private equity group that raised a fund during the credit boom and marks its investments to market to be immune to falling stock markets, such as the FTSE Eurofirst 300, which is down more than half from its peak."
259;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-04-07T21:55:58Z;Havelock Europa bolstered by schools work;;Havelock Europa, the retail and educational interiors outfitter, reported its seventh successive year of profits growth but warned of uncertainty over some of its key customers’ budgets.Revenue from continuing operations rose 15 per cent to £137.6m, while pre-tax profits were also 15 per cent higher at £7.7m.Havelock said its educational interiors division increased its revenue by 20 per cent, benefiting from the first Building Schools for the Future programmes coming on stream in England, while maintaining a leading position in the Scottish schools market.The group’s retail interiors division increased its revenue by 12 per cent to £60.4m and completed four new stores for House of Fraser.Hew Balfour, chief executive, said that in spite of the tough retail environment, the group was benefiting from its long-term relationship with companies such as Boots, Primark and Marks and Spencer.Havelock’s point-of-sale division, Showcard Print, increased revenue by 10 per cent to £25.1m and gained its largest order yet in December by winning the contract to supply the closing-down sale notices for Woolworths.Malcolm Gourlay, chairman, said: “At this stage, in the absence of fully confirmed programmes from a number of substantial retail customers, it is possible that activity levels in 2009 will be weaker than seemed likely at the start of the year.”
260;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-03-12T20:38:20Z;KKR targets Phoenix for Alliance Boots group;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has made an approach to acquire Phoenix, the German drug wholesaler that is part of the faltering empire of Adolf Merckle, the German billionaire who committed suicide in January.KKR, the US private equity group that owns the British drug store chain Alliance Boots, “actively” expressed interest in the business, people familiar with the matter said.“Phoenix would be a perfect fit as Alliance Boots aims to expand and fill gaps in Germany and Europe,” a person close to the discussions said.Both Alliance Boots and KKR declined to comment.A trustee is currently overlooking the sale of several companies to repay the more than €5bn in debt of the Merckle family’s ailing holding company VEM.Among the companies flagged for a potential sale are HeidelbergCement, the owner of UK cement-maker Hanson, and Ratiopharm, the generic drugmaker.A sales process for Phoenix, which posted €21.6bn in revenues in the fiscal year 2007, has not started yet but is expected to commence soon.However, people close to the Merckle family said that HeidelbergCement was likely to be sold first.Phoenix could be valued at about €4bn, according to reports on Bloomberg.Alliance Boots is highly leveraged after its £11.1bn (€12bn) buy-out two years ago. However, KKR pointed out this month it still had $15bn (€11.6bn) in equity to invest in fresh deals.Some of VEM’s debt could be saddled onto Phoenix by the trustee. This could reduce the equity KKR would have to pay and free it from searching for acquisition finance, which is hard to obtain in the wake of the financial crisis. Alliance Boots, which has aimed to expand around Europe ever since KKR bought it, could profit from the stable cash flow of Phoenix. The Mannheim-based drug wholesaler delivers to more than 43,000 pharmacies in 23 countries.Other bidders for Phoenix are not in sight at the moment. Celesio, its Stuttgart-based rival, would likely be blocked because of antitrust reasons.
261;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-03-02T19:37:20Z;LBO blowback;;"They say nobody rings a bell at the top of the market, but the initial public offering of private equity firm Blackstone in June 2007 served that role almost perfectly. The era of bountiful credit began to unravel a matter of weeks after the kings of private equity partially cashed out. Today’s valuation, down 85 per cent, is water under the bridge, but its listing, along with a partial one by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, has at least given the rest of the world a window into how leveraged buy-outs are faring. The picture is not pretty.Blackstone posted a loss of $1.16bn for 2008 and marked down private equity and real estate holdings by 20-30 per cent, on top of earlier writedowns. Heavily indebted holdings such as Hilton Hotels and Freescale Semiconductor will struggle to service debts. Likewise, KKR’s European listed vehicle also saw nothing but red ink. It slashed valuations by 48 per cent as companies such as First Data, Alliance Boots and ProSiebenSat struggled. The picture will be the same for many deals done by still private competitors, particularly the most aggressive 2006 and 2007 vintage.It is too early to write private equity’s epitaph. True, the copious debt that made many leveraged buy-outs so lucrative is gone for now and many equity holdings will go to zero.But distressed markets also present opportunities for long-term capital. Blackstone’s $25bn cash pile, for example, is an attractive alternative for cash-hungry companies that can no longer turn to competitors or public markets when selling subsidiaries. And private equity firms possess a useful set of skills in today’s economy, which Blackstone’s CEO dubbed a “depression”. Restructuring expertise and the ability to wring cash out of challenging balance sheets will come in handy indeed.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

262;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Roche censured for gift vouchers to children;;"Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, was on Friday sharply rebuked by British regulators for offering £10 ($14) gift vouchers to children to persuade them to take one of its medicines. The Prescriptions Medicines Code of Practice Authority, the self-regulatory body, ruled Roche had “brought discredit” on the industry for a serious breach of its ethical rules of conduct.Between 2004 and 2007, the company gave gift vouchers for use in Toys R Us, Tesco and Boots to children and teenagers prescribed Pulmozyme, its inhaled medicine to prevent lung infections for patients with cystic fibrosis. For a year after Roche decided to stop the voucher scheme in September 2007, it failed to recognise that the agency contracted to run the voucher scheme was still operating it, and to end it.The case highlights the difficulties for the National Health Service and pharmaceutical companies in finding ethical ways to persuade patients to take their medicines. Poor compliance is widespread, and sharply reduces benefits of treatment. However, the judgment raises broader questions about Roche’s operations in the UK, after other reprimands including one that led to its suspension from its trade body for six months, one of the most severe sanctions. That ban was lifted only in February.Roche tried to boost compliance with Pulmozyme by giving a voucher to children for every 30 caps of medicine received. Its agency told the company the names of participating doctors, who received no incentive.A Roche employee raised concerns with regulators, arguing the company was “effectively …paying children to continue with a prescription-only medicine”; and that the incentive could threaten the child’s safety by persuading it to keep taking the medicine despite side-effects. The whistleblower voiced worries that the children could simply remove the caps to exchange for vouchers without taking the medicine, in the process wasting NHS money.Roche accepted the ruling, but argued the benefits in promoting compliance outweighed any adverse consequences for public health."
263;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-02-20T23:33:31Z;Workers at Boots win bonus claim case;;Rank-and-file workers who are denied an annual bonus may have a stronger claim against their employers in court following a little-noticed ruling involving Boots, the drugs retailer.While recent attention has focused mostly on the multi-million-pound payments raked in by allegedly undeserving bank bosses, tens of thousands of UK employees are actually eligible for performance-related bonuses each year.Legal experts gave warning on Friday night that attempts to freeze or scrap those payments amid the deepening economic gloom might be successfully challenged in court following a tribunal ruling reinforcing the view that even schemes that purported to be wholly “discretionary” could be contractually enforceable.The case was brought by a group of Boots warehousemen whose bonuses were halted when their jobs were transferred to Unipart, a logistics company, between 2004 and 2007, after which they returned to Boots.They claimed the company’s failure to make the payments was an unlawful deduction of their wages, on the grounds that Boots had a long-standing practice of paying bonuses to its warehousemen.In fact, the retailer acknowledged that an annual benefit had been paid every year since 1967, save for two years when performance targets were not met.The Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) backed the warehousemen’s claim that even though the Boots scheme was referred to as “discretionary”, the workers might still be contractually entitled to their bonuses. “The extent of an employer’s discretion in relation to a bonus scheme is relevant to the determination of the question of whether, and, if so, to what extent the scheme has contractual content,’’ Mrs Justice Slade ruled.The case will now be sent back to an employment tribunal for further review.It is thought to be the first time that the EAT, which hears hundreds of workplace disputes each year, has examined the meaning of the word discretionary in the context of a bonus claim.Businesses rely on the non-binding nature of their schemes to ensure that they are not forced into making hefty outlays to poorly performing employees, or when they simply have no profits to distribute.But in light of the Boots decision companies keen to impose an across-the-board moratorium or freeze on bonuses as the recession bites might be increasingly vulnerable to a lawsuit, lawyers said.“Employers should not assume that the label ‘discretionary’ gives them absolute freedom over whether to make payment under a bonus scheme,” said Louise Randall, a solicitor at Shoo-smiths. “Documents need to be drafted clearly and carefully to stress every aspect of the scheme that is discretionary, in order to avoid claims that it is a contractual entitlement.’’Lawyers are gearing up for a surge in compensation disputes amid the mounting public furore over bonuses.Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, was this week attacked for a government-approved agreement to pay staff bonuses of up to £950m for 2008 in spite of its £20bn taxpayer bail-out.Experts said companies that cut the payments in response to investor or political pressure faced a potential morass of legal woes.This month Alexandre Mouradian, a trader who claimed Tradition Securities & Futures short-changed him out of £92,000 from his £1.32m bonus in 2006, won the right to bring a wage deduction case to an employment tribunal.
264;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-02-10T06:43:50Z;Barclays’ top team out to win over critics;;Ever since the credit crunch started, Barclays has taken a doggedly contrary approach to that of many of its rivals.While other banks received government capital injections, John Varley, Barclays’ chief executive, turned to Middle East investors to strengthen its balance sheet. When others retreated from the investment banking business, the bank made an opportunistic bid for the US assets of Lehman Brothers.Rivals have taken big writedowns on their portfolios of leveraged loans, but Barclays has kept them on its balance sheet at their original value. And even as many banks shrink their overseas operations to concentrate on home markets, Mr Varley continues to trumpet the virtues of being a global universal bank.For much of the past 18 months, Barclays’ approach has met with a mixture of scepticism and outright disbelief from investors. On Monday, Mr Varley and his team set out to win over his critics. Its 2008 results statement included a 40-page section setting out its balance sheet exposures in meticulous detail. Robert Le Blanc, Barclays’ risk director, made a rare appearance at a results presentation to explain the figures.This belated attempt at transparency offered up some helpful insights: the bank has £3.1bn in super-senior tranches of asset-backed collateralised debt obligations on its balance sheet, but has taken such extensive provisions against them that substantial further losses are unlikely. Its leveraged loan portfolio, valued at £9.4bn, is largely made up of loans to the private equity buy-outs of Alliance Boots and AA-Saga, both of which continue to perform well.What is more, Barclays last year managed to sell or redeem loans worth more than £9bn with few additional writedowns, suggesting its valuations are accurate.Yet if Mr Varley managed to lay to rest some of the rumours about its balance sheet exposures, he still faces several substantial challenges. The largest among them is the worldwide economic slowdown, which is expected to translate into a sharp increase in bad debts.In 2008, provisions for bad debts almost doubled to £5.4bn, or about 0.95 per cent of Barclays’ total loan book. This year, the bank expects to write off 1.3-1.5 per cent of its loan book, which suggests a bad debt charge of as much as £7.7bn. If sustained for several years, this would raise questions about the bank’s future profitability.And Barclays’ profits were not quite as robust as the £6.1bn pre-tax figure the bank reported yesterday. This amount was boosted by a larger-than-expected £2.3bn gain from the purchase of the US assets of Lehman Brothers, which Barclays acquired last autumn for less than book value.Barclays booked a £326m one-off profit from the sale of a life assurance portfolio which is closed to new business, and smaller gains from the stock market flotation of Visa, the credit card company, and the sale of shares in Mastercard. It also recognised a £1.6bn profit from the reduced value of its own debt – a convention required by accounting standards – which helped ease the impact of £8bn in gross writedowns taken by Barclays last year.Over the next few weeks, Mr Varley’s resolve is likely to face another stiff test in the form of the government’s proposed scheme to insure banks against unexpected future losses.When the scheme was announced last month Barclays – like other banks – welcomed the initiative, which is designed to stimulate lending to consumers and companies.But over the weekend Alistair Darling, the chancellor, signalled that banks participating in the scheme would be asked to sign up to restrictions on future compensation. This would put Barclays in an awkward position: the bank has made a virtue of its determination to resist government meddling. But if it decided not to participate Barclays could find itself at a competitive disadvantage to rivals such as Royal Bank of Scotland.Barclays shares closed at 116.2p, up 11.4p on the day and more than double the level they fell to last month, when stock market panic prompted Mr Varley and Marcus Agius, the chairman, to write an open letter to shareholders and bring forward the bank’s results by a week.Even so, the shares trade at about a third of Barclays’ net asset value, suggesting that investors are still unsure about whether the bank will need more capital. “The underlying trends continue to indicate lower profitability with risk that the free capital generation is still not enough to absorb the cost of the [insurance] scheme and potential further losses,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote.Few of Barclays’ critics believed the bank would be able to maintain its contrarian stance for as long as it has. But it will still be some time before Mr Varley can claim he was right all along.
265;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Alliance Boots merger move with D&A;;Alliance Boots is planning to create the second biggest optician in the UK after agreeing to merge its 300-strong chain of eye shops with competitor Dollond & Aitchison.Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, said in an interview with the FT that he had been working on the all-share deal for about a year.“To be a smaller number three or four, to be second tier is not comfortable”, said Mr Pessina, who orchestrated Europe’s biggest ever buy-out in 2007 when he took Alliance Boots private for £11.1bn. “So you have to do something, you have to sell or expand. It was one or the other and we have found our solution.”The merger between D&A, which is owned by Italian eyewear designer and retailer De Rigo, and Boots Opticians will give the duo a market share of 17 to 18 per cent, against 23 per cent for Specsavers.The enlarged chain, which is debt free, will have 690 stores and 5,000 employees. Alliance Boots will own just less than 60 per cent.Mr Pessina said he expected to be forced to dispose of some stores because of competition concerns – although he did not know how many will be sold.He also said he did not expect to make many job cuts, as he plans to expand the chain. Alliance Boots, which was taken private by Mr Pessina and private equity group KKR, traded reasonably well over Christmas but is highly leveraged. Net debt stood at £8.75bn in the year to March 31, against earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £1bn.Mr Pessina said he has no concerns about Alliance Boots’ debt levels, pointing out that lending agreements were in place until 2014. “Our cash flow is very healthy, our results will not be bad at all, we don’t have any worries at all in five years’ time the market will be completely different.”He also said that Alliance Boots was reviewing whether to close its defined benefit pension scheme to existing members. “We are analysing it. The volatility [of defined benefit schemes] and the markets makes it particularly difficult [to run these schemes] and it is not just true for us, it is true for everyone.”
266;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-01-24T00:45:38Z;The Diary: AN Wilson;;Yet again, I lose my reading glasses. My sight was once perfect. Then, eight years ago or so, I found my arms were not long enough to read the paper. I am too mean to fall for the con trick of “opticians”, so always go for the sort of specs you can buy over the counter at the chemist. Being anti-Boots, I always use the other pharmacy in Camden High Street. For some reason they keep reading glasses at floor level, so you have to crawl on hands and knees to try them on. As I am doing so, and mulling over the rival merits of being a horn-rimmed professor or a rimless Gestapo officer, I listen in to the conversation at the counter. It has begun in English, between an old African man and the Asian behind the counter. They switch to a language I do not understand, and I stand up to listen. There is no doubt what they are talking about: there is transparent and infectious rapture in their faces. Both are Kenyans – one is a Hindu refugee from Kenyatta’s racism, the other is black, but both happy that a grandson of Kenya is on his way to the White House. Their conversation, whose words I cannot grasp, but whose purport is obvious, fills me with a little of their joy. I do not think I have ever felt like this about a political event in my lifetime.The next day, I sit in my horn-rimmeds in the Goodfare Café, Parkway, Camden Town, reading the paper, awaiting the arrival of my true friend Beryl Bainbridge. We tend to meet for breakfasts because in the evenings there is the danger of one or other – or worse, both – of us drinking too much. Lunch breaks up the day and is the true enemy of a writer’s promise.Cooked breakfast is a good start to the writing day, giving you enough energy to work through until four at least without a break. We used to call this greasy spoon El Sordido, but it is now such a nice restaurant that the joke dies on our lips. We both still go for the full fry-up.Beryl is the only person in whose company I still eat such food. Partly because it seems wet not to do so. Partly because if you weigh up ways to go, heart disease – which stands the chance of being quick if not interfered with by some wiseacre at the Royal Brompton Hospital – seems infinitely preferable to cancer.Before Beryl arrives, Dr Jonathan Miller comes in with his son. He has heard some broadcast I made over Christmas with the new Oldie Tsarina, Joan Bakewell, in a series of hers called Belief. He seems genuinely pained that I had any belief in life after death, and tries to start a conversation on the fatuity of a view of life that seemed natural to (let us say) Ghandi, Dante, Plato …Jonathan is a kind neighbour and friend, and much cleverer than I am, so I am glad when I am saved by the bell, or the Beryl, and do not have to counter his formidable lines of materialist argument.Over our fry, Beryl and I contemplate a “review” by Frederick Raphael of Ian McEwan’s novel Chesil Beach. in the official magazine of Pen, the charity that defends the freedom of writers around the world. Raphael has been given pages in which to rant against McEwan’s stuff. One wonders which the old boy finds more enraging – the fact that McEwan is rather a poor writer, or the other undoubted fact that he is much more successful than F Raphael, or B Bainbridge or, come to that, AN Wilson.When I started learning German a few years ago, my teacher said the English could never really understand the word Schadenfreude. Give me an example, I said. Suppose, she said, you watched a friend come into the room and trip over a bucket of paint. This would be very funny, no? We would all laugh? Schadenfreude is not malicious, she explained. In that case, we need to invent a word for the feelings all writers have when they read bad reviews of someone else’s work – even when they can see the review is unfair or (in the case of Raphael’s demolition of McEwan) a little bit deranged.Lunch with my friend Marcelle Quinton, whose first language was German and who is rather merciless about my mistakes in that – surely quite difficult? – language. She tells me that my grammatical failures are so pathetic that I must be doing them deliberately. Marcelle was born in Berlin, and got out for the usual reasons in the late 1930s and, eventually, reached the United States. Meanwhile, in England the future philosopher Tony Quinton was being born the child of a naval doctor and going to Stowe under the headmastership of the great Roxburgh. What a school! His contemporaries included the philosopher John Simopoulos, the great journalist Peregrine Worsthorne, the jazz musician George Melly.Marcelle and Tony have written a book called Before We Met and had it published by Half Moon Press in New York. I urge Marcelle to get it published (or at least distributed to bookshops) here. It makes me think every married couple who have been together for 60 years should write a “Before We Met”. But in the Quintons’ case, the story is so extraordinary and well-told that it deserves a much wider audience. Both of them narrowly missed death – Marcelle by being Jewish, and Tony by being torpedoed when he and his mother tried to cross the Atlantic to escape hostilities.And the day has dawned – the day that the two old men were discussing in the chemist’s shop. My wife, determined to be unimpressed by anything that excites me, sits upstairs, and my 10-year-old daughter sits looking embarrassed as I sob my way through the new president’s oration.But it surely is very moving? And wonderful to be seeing it live? My only regret is that Obama did not produce a pack of Chesterfields and light up, saying, “My fellow Americans, this is the land of the free and I am a smoker.”I have a number of American in-laws and an American grandchild, so the wave of anti-Americanism that has swept Europe in the Bush years pains me. Surely – however cynical you might be – there was something incredibly impressive about this event? Surely all Americans, whatever age, creed or race, will have been as weepily enthusiastic as I was? But later that evening the telephone goes. The throaty cynical laugh of an old friend of mine from New York. “What d’you think of Ali Baba?” (Is that already a nickname for Obama?) My wife is pleased when I tell her. “I suppose some people think he can work miracles,” she says. I am too shy to admit that I am one of those people. There are millions of us…AN Wilson’s latest book is ‘Our Times: The Age of Elizabeth II’ (Hutchinson, £25)
267;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-01-21T19:54:55Z;Sainsbury to axe 200 staff at head office;;J Sainsbury is to join the growing ranks of businesses making people redundant because of the deepening downturn, after unveiling plans to cut its head office staff by more than 5 per cent.Justin King, the supermarket group’s chief executive, told staff on Wednesday that he would be cutting more than 200 jobs from the Holborn office as part of a restructuring programme.Sainsbury employs about 3,000 people in the head office, while the wider business has 150,000 staff.Sainsbury said on Wednesday that it would be streamlining its five main business units in its trading division to three – non-food, grocery and fresh food – which would make dozens of roles redundant.Mr King’s announcement comes just 10 days after he told investors that he was not planning any significant job cuts, as he delivered his Christmas trading update.That update came a day after Marks and Spencer revealed it was culling 1,200 staff in an effort to rein in costs.Sainsbury reiterated, on Wednesday, that it still planned to add up to 5,000 staff to the group in the coming year through store openings.It also said it was hiring Claire Harrison-Church from Alliance Boots as director of brand communications and Andrew Mann from Tesco as director of customer insight and loyalty.Tens of thousands of retailing jobs have been lost in recent weeks as a clutch of retailers – from Woolworths to MFI – have collapsed in the face of rising debt burdens and a downturn in trading.Sainsbury has fared better than some of its peers, delivering year-on-year underlying sales growth of 4.5 per cent in the 13 weeks to January 13.However, Mr King did acknowledge this month that trading could become more difficult as more people lose their jobs during the coming year.Sainsbury shares dipped 6¾p on Wednesday to close at 311¼p.Wm Morrison is expected to update the City on its trading performance over Christmas on Thursday.The UK’s fastest-growing listed supermarket, which reported an 8.1 per cent rise in like-for-like third-quarter sales, has been adding market share during the Christmas period, according to Nielsen, the research group.Meanwhile, Somerfield, which is about to be acquired by the Co-operative Group, said on Wednesday that underlying sales in the three weeks to January 3 rose 3.7 per cent, taking fourth-quarter underlying growth to 2.6 per cent.The Co-op, which in July agreed to pay £1.57bn for Somerfield to a consortium of Apax Partners, Barclays Capital, Robert Tchenguiz and Kaupthing, should compete the acquisition by the end of February.The UK’s largest mutually-owned retailer delivered underlying sales up 6 per cent on a like-for-like basis in the three weeks to January 3, with fourth-quarter sales up 5.2 per cent.
268;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2009-01-20T19:28:11Z;Alchemy chief warns on default levels;;Almost a third of companies owned by UK mid-market private equity groups could default on their debts as the downturn deepens, according to Jon Moulton, head of buy-out house Alchemy Partners.Mr Moulton, a well-known Cassandra of the private equity industry who predicted many of the problems caused by the credit crunch, said on Tuesday that some private equity houses that have made too many bad investments could disappear.“There will be firms quitting the market,” the Alchemy boss told a private equity conference organised by the London School of Economics. “The recession will kill a lot of the firms that have made poor investments and are punished by investors.”In the previous big UK recession, between 1990 and 1992, Mr Moulton said default – including any event that means lenders are not repaid as planned, such as a debt-for-equity swap – was the biggest exit route for private equity deals.Asked if private equity should shoulder some blame for the crisis in the UK banking system, he said yes, but argued it was a passive actor and likened its role to that of London in the Blitz. “We were there,” he said.Illustrating his point with a chart showing that senior debt in 10 of Europe’s biggest private equity portfolio companies was trading at below 60 per cent of par value, he said the equity in these deals had “little more than option value”.Alliance Boots, the pharmacy chain bought by KKR and Stefano Pessina for £3.5bn of equity and £9bn of debt, was the biggest private equity deal in Europe when completed in 2007. But Mr Moulton said with Alliance Boots senior debt trading at less than 60 per cent of par value, “it is impossible to attribute any real value to that equity”.He added that the holding company of ProSiebenSat.1, the German broadcaster bought for €8.5bn (£7.7bn) by KKR and Permira, had debt trading at 5 cents in the euro. “The market is betting they are not even going to make a single interest payment,” he said.However, many buy-out bosses argue that the price of debt in their companies reflects the turmoil in credit markets and is not a true reflection of their value. They also say their long-term financing means they have no need to sell before markets recover.
269;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-12-30T23:41:11Z;Lloyds to fend off HBOS trustees’ demands;;Lloyds TSB has signalled its determination to see off demands from the trustees of the HBOS pension scheme for greater security for retirement benefits once its acquisition of the ailing mortgage lender is complete.It emerged on Tuesday that the HBOS trustees intend to use their status as one of the largest creditors of the company to challenge the Scheme of Arrangement under which the bank is to be acquired by Lloyds.The trustees are not seeking additional cash but want the combined parent company to stand behind the pension promises, rather than the proposed structure that leaves subsidiary companies as guarantors of retirement benefits.Trustees to the Alliance Boots pension scheme had made a similar threat while negotiating for greater security prior to completion of a leveraged buy-out. But the challenge was never tested in court because Alliance Boots made concessions.On Tuesday, Lloyds said the fact that it is acquiring HBOS means scheme members are better off. “We have engaged with the HBOS pension trustees since shortly after the announcement of the proposed acquisition and will continue to do so.“HBOS pension trustees and members of the HBOS scheme can expect to see a strengthening of the supporting covenant when the proposed acquisition of HBOS completes.“We will seek to give equivalent treatment to all pension schemes under the enlarged group and have made this clear to the HBOS trustees.”Lloyds does not currently back the pension promises of subsidiary companies itself and to do so for the HBOS retirees would give them greater comfort than its own scheme members.An adviser to the HBOS trustees said that at the hearing to approve the scheme the judge will commission a report into the merits of the trustees’ complaint.But even if Lloyds persuades the judge that no further security on pensions is needed, the trustees could prove a thorn in its side. Among other things, they plan to press ahead with a new valuation report based on the assumption that HBOS debts do not have the backing of Lloyds.That would require it to be more risk averse in its investment strategy, placing more assets in low-risk securities at the expense of riskier assets that can make higher returns.
270;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-12-28T18:47:32Z;Adams heads for administration;;Adams, the childrenswear chain, plans to appoint PwC as administrator on Monday after it became the latest retailer to fall victim to the consumer downturn.The Nuneaton-based chain operates 260 stores and concessions in the UK and supplies Boots, the health and beauty group, with children’s clothes under the Mini Mode brand.The company’s collapse leaves Burdale, the Irish asset-backed lending specialist, looking to recover money lent to a large retailer for the third time this year. Burdale financed Woolworths, which failed last month, and Roseby’s, the textile chain, which went into administration earlier this year. The bank lent Adams £10m earlier this year.It is the second time that Adams has fallen into administration in less than two years. In February last year the business was bought in a pre-pack administration by John Shannon, an entrepreneur who previously owned stakes in Country Casuals and Stead and Simpson.In spite of a like-for-like sales uplift in the first 12 months under new ownership, the retailer has been affected by the slump in consumer spending. Like many in the troubled sector, it is currently discounting clothes by up to 70 per cent in an attempt to attract customers.Two months ago, chief executive David Carter-Johnson was speaking confidently about the company’s prospects. “The majority of the stores are profitable,” he told Drapers, the fashion industry magazine. “We discarded the serious loss makers – that is a great place to start from but we are talking about a company whose turnover has shrunk for four consecutive years.””We know this is a huge task,” he said. “But the business has unlocked potential and kidswear is pretty much recession-proof – children grow and need clothes.”The pending administration of Adams follows that of Zavvi, Whittard of Chelsea, The Officers Club and Woolworths which all failed just before Christmas.In a recent research note, retail analysts at Credit Suisse predicted more gloom for some retailers: “The over-borrowed nature of both the consumer and the retailers (especially those in private ownership) suggests a lengthy period of profit correction, notwithstanding government attempts to support demand through influencing monetary policy and its own fiscal policy.”The analysts wrote that the survivors may try to combine to fend off administration with “the desire for defensive mergers and acquisitions among the [larger] operators set against the fall-out from wider corporate failure among small- to mid-sized operators”.Adams’ administration puts more than 3,000 jobs at risk, adding to the heavy toll borne by the sector in recent months. Woolworths and MFI entered administration on the same day last month.MFI’s administrators have already accepted that there will not be a buyer for the business as a going concern while Deloitte, administrator to Woolworths, has begun to close the retailer’s stores and has also acknowledged that no potential buyer has yet been able to finance a potential rescue deal.
271;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-12-23T19:13:43Z;Retail row spreads to Santa’s grotto;;Santa’s grotto is the unlikely setting for the latest bout in the bitter financial struggle between shops and their landlords.In a ruling that will affect retailers throughout the country, the High Court has said that shops in Manchester’s Trafford shopping centre should have to pay the full cost of the centre’s grotto and Christmas decorations.The dispute hinged on whether Santa’s grotto was a sales promotion or an environmental improvement. Boots, the health and beauty chain, had argued that the grotto was a promotion and that the Trafford centre was therefore legally obliged to pick up 50 per cent of the costs.But the High Court ruled that Santa’s residence was an “environmental improvement” and that the cost should be paid by the retailers via their annual service charge.Mike Butterworth, managing director of the mall, said: “It’s a very serious issue – it affects a lot of shopping centres up and down the country.”Boots said it “genuinely believes there is an ambiguity in the terms of the lease between the service charge and promotions clauses in our contract.” It added: “We are currently reviewing the judgment.”Retailers and landlords have been hit hard by the economic downturn, setting the scene for wrangling over the level and timing of rental payments. While legal action and Santa’s appearance are unusual elements of the case, retailers have told landlords that they expect further concessions on the service charge, which covers costs ranging from insurance to tinsel.“What we say is that landlords should be making it much clearer to tenants how they are actually arriving at the service charge figures,” said Richard Dodd of the British Retail Consortium.The British Property Federation, which represents landlords, has written to all its members to encourage reasonable reductions where possible.“There is a growing sense of dissatisfaction amongst the customer community, particularly in the retail sector, regarding the level of service charges and the way in which they are managed,” Francis Salway, chief executive of Land Securities and president of the BPF, acknowledges in the letter.Westfield, a new London shopping mall, enraged retailers in November by raising service charges just days after the £1.6bn centre opened for business. That confrontation followed skirmishes between the two troubled sectors throughout 2008.Retailers led by Sir Philip Green, the owner of Topshop, and Lord Harris of Peckham, chairman of Carpetright, have led a group of disgruntled retailers agitating to pay rent monthly rather than quarterly and for reduced service charges.
272;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-12-16T19:13:19Z;Pharmacy ruling frustrates EU retailers;;Efforts by some of Europe’s biggest retail chains to overturn ownership restrictions on pharmacies in European Union countries including Germany, France, Italy and Spain were frustrated in Europe’s top court on Tuesday.A surprise preliminary legal opinion in two test cases found European law does allow EU member states to put curbs on who may own and operate pharmacies. The conclusion could seriously hamper expansion plans for a number of companies.A senior legal adviser at the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice said restrictions – for example, requiring owners to be qualified pharmacists – were justified because of the need to “protect public health”.The same quality of service, advocate-general Yves Bot concluded, could not be guaranteed by imposing rules and penalties on non-pharmacist operators and salaried pharmacists. He said the normal “freedom of establishment” rules were trumped by public health concerns.Advocate-generals’ opinions are not binding on the full court at the ECJ, which must still rule on the matter. But they are upheld in about 80 per cent of cases.If the court does take the same view, it will be a serious setback for retailers including Germany’s Celesio and Britain’s Alliance Boots and supermarket chains such as France’s Carrefour, known to be keen to expand into pharmacy.Shares in Celesio, which had brought one of the test cases, closed down 15 per cent to €19 after the opinion on Tuesday. The German healthcare and drug distributor had said publicly it would like to establish a pharmacy chain, and suggested it could establish up to 50 units in the first year if restrictions were lifted.On Tuesday, Celesio said only that it would await the full court ruling. In the meantime, it would “keep up the pace” through its mail order operation and franchise arrangements with pharmacy owners.
273;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-12-12T22:20:36Z;Late payments likely to persist despite new code;;The head of one of the UK’s main credit checking agencies has warned that the government’s new voluntary code to encourage prompt payment by large companies is unlikely to succeed.Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, this week launched the code to commit companies to stick to their payment terms.The code, developed with the Institute of Credit Management and supported by John Lewis Partnership and Asda among others, aims to establish a clear and consistent policy in the payment of business to business bills.However, Martin Williams, managing director of Graydon UK, a commercial credit agency, said he was not convinced the proposals would turn the tide of late payments.“Long before the economic crisis really began to bare its teeth, many large corporates were habitually using their purchasing power to squeeze their suppliers through late payment,” he said.“The difference now is that, as the economic situation has worsened, even large companies no longer have the readily-available cash required to pay bills and are failing to pay trade invoices simply because they can’t do so.”Research among members of the Forum of Private Business this month found that 61 per cent had suffered an increase in late payments from customers, compared with the beginning of November.Barclays has estimated that the amount of debt being chased by small businesses has risen to £3,000 per company, due to customers stretching the amount of time they take to settle bills.Small business concerns about late payment have been exacerbated by high-profile examples of large companies forcing suppliers to wait longer for payment.Alliance Boots, the chemist chain, increased the time in which it promises to pay invoices from 30 to 75 days. Tesco, the UK’s largest supermarket group, doubled the time it would take to pay some suppliers from 30 to 60 days in the autumn.Such moves are in sharp contrast to central government’s own target of 10 days to settle its bills.Legislation exists to enable suppliers to sue for late payment, but business organisations say many small companies are reluctant to use the law for fears of antagonising key customers.The Institute of Credit Management will include a facility on its website for suppliers to raise concerns about bigger companies.
274;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-12-09T22:19:25Z;Moves to ease squeeze on suppliers;;Moves to try to stop big companies squeezing their small suppliers will be launched by the government on Wednesday.Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, will host a meeting of the main employers’ groups and some large corporates to launch a voluntary code on payment terms. John Lewis, British Gas and Fujifilm will all sign up to the agreement.Shriti Vadera, the business minister who will attend the meeting, told the Financial Times that the new code would commit companies to stick to their existing payment terms “both in contract and in practice”.Baroness Vadera said the move was designed to address one of the central business issues arising from the credit crunch.“Cashflow, next to lending, is the most significant issue” small businesses are facing, she stated.The code is designed to prevent bigger companies using their purchasing power to ease pressures on their cashflow by squeezing their supply chain. Small business concerns over the issue have been exacerbated by recent high-profile examples of big corporates forcing suppliers to wait longer for payment. Tesco, the largest supermarket chain, this autumn doubled the time it would take to pay some suppliers from 30 to 60 days. Alliance Boots, the pharmaceuticals retailer, increased its payment terms earlier this year from 30 to 75 days.Lord Mandelson has set a target of 10 days for the government to pay its own suppliers, with the aim of extending this to other public bodies, such as local authorities and primary care trusts. Today’s code is an attempt to extend this faster payment culture to the private sector.The initiative will be welcomed by small business organisations. But sceptics may point to the code’s voluntary status and its lack of an upper ceiling on the permitted number of days for payment, which contrasts with the government’s own 10-day target.Baroness Vadera said the variety and complexity of contractual agreements made any upper ceiling very difficult to set. “It’s not the easiest thing to legislate for,” she stated.There is existing legislation, allowing suppliers to sue for late payment. But business organisations say many small companies are reluctant to use this statutory right for fear of antagonising an important customer. The Federation of Small Businesses has also complained that statutory rules, requiring companies to disclose how long they are taking to pay suppliers, are not being enforced effectively by Companies House.The Institute of Credit Management, which has helped to draw up the new code, will include a facility on its website for suppliers to raise concerns about bigger companies.
275;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-11-21T17:01:13Z;Late payers pile on debt for business;;The worsening problem of late payments means that the average amount of debt being chased by small businesses has increased to £3,000 per company, according to figures compiled by Barclays.The bank estimated earlier this year that £8.3bn is owed to small businesses at any time. However, John Davis, marketing director for Barclays Local Business, said the latest figures, taken from the bank’s internal data, show that the situation is becoming more dire.About 40 per cent of small businesses now have late payment problems, according to Mr Davis. “Small businesses generally suffer more than others,” he said. “They tend to pay relatively promptly, but are paid relatively slowly.”Keeping cash flowing is vital to business survival, particularly as the financial crisis tightens its grip and many businesses struggle with falling sales.The Forum of Private Business (FPB), which is compiling a hall of shame of large companies with bad records on payment, says the worst offenders are lengthening the period they settle bills and tightening the terms.Among its most recent additions is Alliance Boots, the pharmaceuticals group, which told suppliers it was extending its payment terms to 75 days from the end of the month an invoice is received, meaning that businesses could wait up to 105 days for payment. The company also imposed a settlement charge of 2.5 per cent.“It is bullying tactics,” said Phil McCabe, FPB spokesman. “We are receiving more reports of imposed changes.”He added that the damage done by late payments has been magnified because the crisis in the financial markets has made it almost impossible to borrow money to cover shortfalls.Debt is a particular problem for small but growing businesses, according to Creditsafe, a debt recovery and credit reporting company. It calculated that businesses with a turnover between £1m and £5m devote 6.5 per cent of total expenditure to servicing debt, compared with only 1.8 per cent for businesses with a turn-over of £251,000 to £500,000.David Knowles, marketing director for Creditsafe UK, said: “As SMEs are predominantly owned and managed by the same individual, the avenues for securing credit are far more restrictive than for larger enterprises. A typical SME does not have shareholder capital to draw through rights issues or the opportunity to engage with institutional investors.”Barclays has started offering a free credit checking service to its small business customers, allowing company owners to see the credit ratings of up to five businesses.The service includes automatic e-mail notification if the credit ratings of the businesses change and a free solicitor’s letter to put pressure on companies for prompter payment.IRS, a Barclays customer that provides industrial refrigeration to businesses, hospitals and universities, claims it was able to resolve a bill for £2,100, which had remained unpaid for more than a year, through the credit checking service.
276;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Suppliers call for action over cash squeeze;;The government should use its £160bn ($235bn) a year purchasing power to ensure big contractors stop squeezing their small suppliers, Peter Mandelson, the business secretary, will be told on Monday.A meeting between owners of small businesses and Lord Mandelson, organised by Claire Curtis-Thomas, a Labour MP, will underline concerns that the 10-day payment period promised by the government to its contractors is not being passed on to small subcontractors. She highlighted a company in her Crosby constituency that has gone “belly up” despite being owed £1.8m by a big contractor that had already been paid for the work by the government.“There are thousands of small subcontractors [affected by this] and that’s where the main business failures are going to be,” she said. “It’s a huge problem.”Concerns about the cash flow pressures on smaller companies have been exacerbated by high-profile examples of big corporates forcing suppliers to wait longer for payment. Tesco, the largest supermarket chain, last month doubled the time it would take to pay some suppliers from 30 to 60 days. Alliance Boots, the pharmaceutical retailer, increased its payment terms earlier this year from 30 to 75 days.The Federation of Small Businesses is calling on Lord Mandelson to ensure that statutory rules requiring companies to disclose how long they are paying suppliers are enforced. Only 40 per cent of quoted companies were complying with the disclosure law, it said.“The big companies are hiding behind small contractors,” Stephen Alambritis, head of parliamentary affairs at the Federation, said. “We’d like the government to give Companies House teeth to enforce the law on payment times.”Pressure from the government for local authorities to apply the 10-day rule appeared to be having results, Mr Alambritis said, with typical payment times down from about 30 to 20 days.The Forum of Private Business said the government’s commitment to pay within 10 days was “setting the standard” for resolving a problem that “can be the difference between trading profitably and not trading”. A survey by the Forum found 88 per cent reported bigger companies not paying on time – a factor that 72 per cent said had a serious impact on their business.The government said its model contract required lead suppliers to pay other firms within the supply chain within 30 days.“Small firms need cash flow. That’s why we aim to pay businesses within 10 days and we’re looking to the private sector to follow suit,” the department for business stated.Analysis: Sum of the parts
277;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

279;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-10-19T21:38:26Z;Nervous times for investors in loan markets;;Investors in European and US loan markets will enter their offices with great trepidation on Monday morning after a flood of forced selling by hedge funds and other leveraged investors sent prices crashing last week.In Europe, the average price of the most commonly traded large leveraged loans to companies such as Alliance Boots, Ineos, NTL and United Biscuits saw its biggest weekly drop, according to S&P LCD, the market information service, and Markit Group.The US market for such debt, which is mainly used for private equity buy-out deals, has also suffered big falls in recent weeks as hedge funds and other market value sensitive investors have become forced sellers.Analysts do not expect the picture to improve in the near term because falling prices for loans and other risky assets lead banks to force hedge funds and other investors who use borrowed money to put up more cash in so-called margin calls or sell holdings. Investors in such funds are increasingly asking for their money back as concern spreads about the state of credit markets. US hedge funds had to hand back $43bn in September according to TrimTabs Investment Research.“A vicious circle of redemptions, margin calls and further redemptions can only make us nervous on [loan and credit] spreads in the short run,” said Peter Goves, Citigroup strategist. “While funds in equities probably have plenty of cash on hand at this point to cope with redemptions, in credit we are not so sure.” He added that a normalisation in loan and credit markets was only possible once so-called real money – or non-leveraged – investors saw value in such stressed prices no matter how bad the economic outlook.The US loan market saw its worst losses nearer the start of October, when the price of loans to companies such as Celanese and Charter Communications dropped from more than 90 cents in the dollar to the low 80s and the high 70s respectively in a matter of days. Loans to Ford Motor have dropped from 65 cents to 42 cents this month, according to data from Markit.Investors put out requests for bids on portfolios of loans worth $2.28bn this month alone, according to S&P LCD, which compares with a total of $471m for all of the third quarter.In Europe, the average price dropped 7.2 cents in the euro to 73.32 cents according to S&P LCD, more than double the previous week’s decline and the biggest weekly drop yet seen.
280;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-10-17T18:50:29Z;Wind of change blows through retail parks;;On a windswept park in Wakefield in Yorkshire stands a large and vacant unit under the banner of Powerhouse, an electrical goods retailer that collapsed more than two years ago.The unit is now being joined by growing vacancies in retail parks as big-ticket retail occupants struggle in the midst of the slowdown.Joining casualties such as Klaussner, the furniture retailer, Powerhouse and, more recently, Rosebys, is MFI, once the UK’s largest furniture retailer, which was bought from administration by managers last month. Although more than half the company’s stores are still expected to trade, 81 remain under threat.Other furniture, DIY and white goods retailers are also reducing store numbers as consumers reduce expenditure on costly items such as sofas and washing machines.Colliers CRE, the property agent, says many retail park tenants, such as B&Q, MFI, Currys, Harveys, Focus, Comet and Halfords, have looked to reduce their stores and rationalise estates.This month, Marks and Spencer told analysts it would reduce capital expenditure this year amid a worsening economic backdrop, which will mean a slowdown in the roll-out of new out-of-town sites.“We are reviewing everything at the moment,” said the retailer.However, while rental growth is coming under pressure as vacancies rise, there are also signs that certain resilient parts of the retail sector are expanding aggressively on more preferential property terms.David Atkins, managing director UK retail at Hammerson, said retailers were in a position to demand better rents.“If someone like MFI is releasing so much space on the market, then you want that space filled. The market has moved in favour of the retailer.”Large-format outlets in the DIY and furniture sectors have been contracting after years of expansion, he said but pointed to growth in certain sectors, particularly homeware and soft furnishings. TK Maxx, Asda and Tesco are all expanding their homewares businesses, he said, alongside specialists such as Au Naturale.Dominic Rodbourne, associate director at Savills, said: “If people can’t buy a new sofa set, they’ll get some curtains or cushions to improve their homes.”Some smaller and mid-sized occupiers, including Argos, Boots, Brantano, Peacocks, Mothercare, Pets at Home and Clarks, are also seen as cautiously expanding, according to Colliers.Retailers such as Dreams say they can take their pick of locations and are finding negotiations with landlords much easier. Dreams is expected to open 19 stores by this year and 32 next year.Charles Dunstone of Carphone Warehouse said this week that conditions had never been better to pick up good, cheap retail sites.In Chicago to launch his retail venture with Best Buy, the US electricals chain, Mr Dunstone said it was a “brilliant” time to introduce the group to the UK. “It is the best time to find property …to hire people.”Agents say that while retail park tenants may be scaling back, some are simply improving portfolios. DSG International this week opened a 60,000 sq ft store near Birmingham, testing a new concept under the Currys Megastore brand.…………………………………………..JL falls againJohn Lewis saw sales fall significantly again this week, writes Kiran Stacey.The retailer, which is seen as a barometer for the rest of the high street, reported a 4.8 per cent fall in overall sales to £48.9m from the same week last year, while like-for-like sales fell an estimated 10 per cent.Sales at the group’s supermarket operation, Waitrose, fell 0.3 per cent to £73.5m.John Lewis was keen to blame the autumn sunshine, but Nick Bubb, analyst at Pali International, said falling stock markets were as much to blame.“Customers will have seen the markets slide in the middle of the week and been affected by the general sentiment.”
281;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-09-15T00:07:06Z;Opinion: It’s time to pay attention to cash;;Ask any accountant how to ensure a small business survives a downturn and he, or she, will say you need to run it for cash. But what does that mean? Running a small business is hard enough at the best of times – and it is getting harder.In the US, large public companies are already taking longer to pay each other. According to a study in the US, the number of days companies take on average to pay each other rose from 39.7 in 2006 to 41 in 2007.Cross the Atlantic, and things seem to be improving, but the starting point is often far worse. Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark are Europe’s fast-pay champions, according to Intrum Justicia, a credit management company.Nordic companies take on average just 31 days to settle invoices. In the UK and Ireland the average in this year’s IJ survey was 51.6, rising to 58.5 in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, and an appalling 91.1 days in Portugal, Spain and Italy.When big companies see sales growth slowing, or find the cost of credit rising, the first thing many do is to issue invoices faster, and pay suppliers later. Alliance Boots, a UK pharmaceuticals retailer, recently extended its standard payment delay for suppliers from 30 days to 90.For small companies at the end of the feeding chain, delays like these cause real problems. The main creditors of small companies, particularly those in the service sector, are often money-now-please utilities, national insurance – known across Europe as social contributions – or professional service providers. Try asking your accountant to wait three months for his fees – and watch his smile fade.The answer is to make collecting money as important as winning new work. Issue the invoice immediately after the job is done, and ensure it is received and processed.The individual who places the order with you is rarely the one who pays you. Find out who is processing your invoice, then phone or email them and build a personal relationship, fast. Otherwise, especially with new customers, your invoice can get lost in the pipeline.If customers take too long to pay, ditch them. This spring, I did some work for a Paris company in February, and was paid in June. Never again. Chasing a couple of thousand euros ate hours of time and energy.Pay very close attention to costs. Ditch phone lines made redundant by broadband. Buy only the technology you need, taking care not to duplicate software licences you have already bought for multiple computers.Spend money on marketing, to keep your face in front of clients who pay promptly, rather than chasing new ones. Axe low-return projects.Managing for cash has important benefits. A positive bank balance produces a better night’s sleep than bank borrowings, thereby improving the quality of management.It gives a cushion against the unforeseen. But it also gives flexibility.In many countries dividends attract a lower tax than income.So a healthy year-end cash balance is mighty tax efficient. What better way to start 2009 than by reaping the rewards of 2008?
282;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-09-11T02:15:18Z;Reform of shop rents takes step forward;;The clash between the retail and property sectors over the reform of shop rents moved closer to resolution on Wednesday after landlords agreed to more flexibility on payments amid difficult trading conditions.With both the retail and property sectors under pressure to cut costs and maintain income in the economic downturn, a dispute has arisen over the historic system of quarterly payment of rents in advance.Retailers, who complain that quarterly rents are unfair and archaic, have called for monthly rents, but property landlords have so far resisted the move, particularly for existing leases.After a meeting on Wednesday between representatives of retail and property companies chaired by Sir Bryan Carsberg, the former head of the Office of Fair Trading, landlords will be asked to provide monthly terms for occupiers facing difficulties.A number of large retailers were present, including Boots, John Lewis, Next, Signet and Travis Perkins, while some of the largest landlords in the country such as Hammerson, Land Securities and PruPIM were also at the meeting.However, while there was the agreement that there needed to be flexibility on monthly rental terms for companies in distress, there was no suggestion of action to alter terms across all existing leases.Attendees said that landlords would now consider monthly rents as part of negotiations on future leases, but were unlikely to change the terms of existing leases without sufficient compensation, such as higher rents.One attendee said on Wednesday that most progress had been made on retailers in trouble, who should now get the right to monthly rents if requested, but that the ultimate goal was a recognition of the principle of monthly over quarterly rents.A statement from delegations of both sides – led by trade bodies British Retail Consortium and the British Property Federation – is expected Thursday morning. No one would comment ahead of the announcement.The quarterly payment system dates back to when debts were collected on horseback. Landlords see the system as more efficient, as four payments a year involve less administration, while it also has greater certainty over income levels.Sir Philip Green, the Arcadia owner, has also called for meetings with landlords to discuss rental terms, as well as concessions on service charges and insurance. He has the support of a long list of fellow retailers. These meetings are expected to take place next week.
283;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-08-20T21:46:29Z;BAA chairman aims to make a difference;;Sir Nigel Rudd, the chairman of BAA, is a man used to being on the firing line.Founder of the Williams Group conglomerate, chairman of Pendragon and deputy chairman of Barclays, Sir Nigel has hired and fired corporate chief executives by the handful. He led Boots, the pharmacy chain, into a £7.8 merger with Alliance Unichem, then sold the combined group to private equity.Blunt and pugnacious, he publicly denounced retail analysts as “stupid” for failing to appreciate AllianceBoots’ value, then held out for a better price from the private equity bidders.Born in Derbyshire, he passed up university to become a trainee accountant. He spent most of the 1980s and 1990s building up Williams, only to break it up into Chubb and Kidde in 2000. Known as a turnround specialist, he has become a top board choice for UK companies seeking to add gravitas and force change. He could not say no to BAA when Ferrovial, the Spanish owners, came calling two years ago. “I’ve done most things in business. This was a new area where I could make a difference,” he told the Financial Times on Wednesday. “I passionately believe we have got to have better infrastructure.”It has not been an easy time. Sir Nigel was vilified, along with British Airways chief Willie Walsh, for the bungled opening of Heathrow’s Terminal 5, and BAA’s desire to build a third runway for the airport has been mired in controversy.Now Sir Nigel must cope with the Competition Commission’s demands. “There’s a public mood, we want to punish BAA,” Sir Nigel said. “But is it going to be better? Are we going to get the investment and the joined-up-ness if there are different owners? Is it sensible to throw everything up in the air?”Sir Nigel has a tough road ahead but he has no nagging doubts.“Starting your own business is the most difficult thing in the world,” he says. “That’s stressful. This is a walk in the car park compared to that.”
284;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-08-10T14:49:05Z;Battening down hatches on the high street;;"A couple of years ago, Richard Ratner, the high-profile retail analyst who died last year, warned that 2006 could be the worst Christmas the high street had seen in 25 years.In the event, shoppers kept shopping. In 2007, there were more signs of stress but the tills kept ringing.But Mr Ratner’s dire forecast may prove to have been premature, rather than wildly wrong. This year, retailers are preparing for some of the toughest conditions in three decades; Christmas 2008 may be the moment that the economic gloom overwhelms the seasonal goodwill.Since the start of the year, the non-food retail sector has fallen more than 30 per cent on the stock market, as the effects of falling house prices, rising inflation, food bills and petrol prices gnaw at already fragile consumer confidence, prompting profit warnings and share sell-offs.Richard Boys-Stones, partner on PwC’s business recovery team, notes: “There are a lot of management teams that haven’t been through an extended downturn.”Early evidence suggests that the experience – new or not – is more fraught for mid-market retailers than those at the discount end.As middle-class shoppers fret about the rising costs of their Sainsbury’s shopping, or think twice about spending £35 on a pair of sandals from Marks and Spencer, they are discovering cheaper alternatives. The likes of Primark in clothing, Argos in homewares and Aldi in food are looking for opportunities to take market share.Argos will be working out how to snatch business from retailers of beds and sofas who are struggling or going under while Primark and Matalan are looking to steal share from M&S and Next.One former finance director of an FTSE 100 chain says that while retailers will try to cut prices in an effort to entice people into stores, the focus inevitably falls back to cutting costs.Gentle trimming around the edges becomes deeper slashes. First, can cuts be made to the marketing and R&D budget? Second, can working capital be improved by changing payment terms with suppliers or lowering stock levels? Finally, are sackings needed?Gerry Loftus, head of restructuring at Deloitte, says that retailers’ cost base typically are 30 to 40 per cent fixed but there is some room for manoeuvre.In particular, he argues “retailers can be slow to grasp the nettle” on store portfolios that have grown too big or head office staff that have become too numerous. “The other is refurbishment costs, but if you start cutting back too heavily you damage your medium-term prospects.”All these tactics have been deployed by various retailers as they prepare for a downturn that they expect to last until the end of 2009 at the earliest. Even Tesco – the biggest retailer in the county – took the axe to its cost base earlier this year, cutting hundreds of jobs.Alliance Boots, the drugs wholesale and pharmacy chain, angered its suppliers by changing payment terms in an effort to improve its working capital. Suppliers now have to wait up to 75 days from the end of month in which the invoice is submitted for payment, a move that has damaged their cash flows but boosted Alliance Boots’s by £50m-£100m annually.The relationship between suppliers and retailers can be instrumental to businesses going into administration. Fopp, the music retailer, had to admit defeat when CDs stopped arriving; it was subsequently bought by HMV.Credit insurers are becoming nervous about risk and withdrawing cover from suppliers serving some weaker companies. “A lot of directors don’t really understand credit insurance and so it only becomes an issue when it start to get difficult,” says Mr Boys-Stones.When businesses are on the edge, mindsets need to change, he argues. For example, “cash now is much more important than profit”; he advises giving up on protecting margins and abandoning profitable sales in favour of getting some cash through the door to stave off the prospect of insolvency.As retailers begin to breach bank loan covenants, they may still have some bargaining power – even with unsentimental lenders, advises Mr Boys-Stones: “Nobody wants to bring the whole thing down.”………………………………………………………………………………………………….Hard discounters bask in sunlightA calculator on the homepage of Aldi's website claims that I could save £83,317 ($159,747) over the course of my lifetime if I stopped doing my £130-a-week shop in a mainstream supermarket and instead went to my local Aldi, writes Elizabeth Rigby.Of course, it would mean that I would only be able to pick from 1,100 different lines rather than the 20,000 products available in a typical supermarket, and there would be no branded goods, such as Kellogg's cornflakes and Pepsi-Cola, in my trolley.But, in return, Aldi promises to be at least 20 per cent cheaper than its bigger rivals.The pull of cheaper prices is having quite an effect on British shoppers, according to Paul Foley, UK managing director at Aldi.Since the beginning of 2008, this hard discount retailer has managed to expand UK market share from 2.2 to 2.9 per cent. After nearly 20 years of fighting to make a mark in the UK, hard discounters are finally having their moment in the sun.It is not that Aldi has been doing things differently. Mr Foley hasn't changed his marketing strategy, staff levels or added new lines. But what is changing is the environment in which he operates, and that is bringing different customers through the doors."
285;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-08-01T19:35:35Z;Kravis looks to the listed life: the buy-out veteran enters Wall St;;Henry Kravis, dealmaker extraordinaire, was this week strolling the corridors of Wall Street. But when the co-founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Scott Nuttall, one of his young partners, visited staff at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs on Monday, it was not because he was about to acquire and restructure yet another troubled industrial company, taking it off the stock market. Instead, the two investment banks are advising KKR on what is to be its own New York listing.KKR, arguably the most venerable name in the 30-year history of leveraged buy-outs – where private equity uses a sliver of its own investors’ cash and lots of borrowed money to take over a company – has picked a seemingly odd time and awkward way to make its public debut. It is to merge with its ailing Amsterdam listed offshoot called KKR Private Equity Investors (KPE) and list the combined entity on the New York Stock Exchange.The move marks the latest and most public stage in a long and intense rivalry between Mr Kravis and Stephen Schwarzman, co-founder of Blackstone, a main competitor for investor funds and for pre-eminence in the private equity business.Though from differing backgrounds, the two men are alike in many ways – they share expensive interests in trophy apartments, French antiques and philanthropy. Mr Kravis, son of a wealthy oil wildcatter, donated $10m (£5m, €6m) to secure a Henry R. Kravis Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Blackstone chief, whose father owned a drapery near Philadelphia, donated $100m to refurbish the New York Public Library, which is to be renamed in Mr Schwarzman’s honour.Unlike Blackstone, which listed on Wall Street last year, KKR will raise no money from the exercise: it is not selling any stock. But Mr Kravis has been telling Wall Street that this did not matter. KKR executives will be able to sell 15-20 per cent of their holdings a year after the listing, with the rest “vesting” to them over six to eight years.By merging with KPE when its shares on Euronext Amsterdam have fallen by half since listing in 2006, KKR is buying stakes in its own deals at bargain prices. That could be taken as a show of confidence that things are close to the bottom. To Mr Kravis and George Roberts, his cousin and co-founder, listing is a critical step in the evolution of the firm they founded in 1976, which shot to fame 20 years ago with the $30bn takeover of RJR Nabisco that was immortalised in the book Barbarians at the Gate.One investment banker working on the listing says it opens another chapter in the arms race among private equity firms. This is a race that KKR did not merely lead but in which it had the field mostly to itself for many years, before rivals such as Blackstone, Carlyle and TPG were created and while its competitors at the time, such as Forst­mann Little, were fading.For a time in the 1990s, however, KKR itself seemed to be on the wane. Several of the companies it bought filed for bankruptcy protection. When, for example, Regal Cinemas went bust, KKR and its investors lost $500m. Even a visit to the firm’s hallowed halls at West 57th Street with their sweeping views of New York’s Central Park had the feel of a stately home, frozen in time. The walls were dark, the oil paintings oppressive, the furniture fussy. The contrast was stark with the simple quarters of Blackstone on Park Avenue or the sunny offices of TPG with their views of San Francisco Bay.In recent years, though, the old artwork has gone, replaced with more avant-garde images. Mr Kravis and Mr Roberts, both 64, seem re-energised. In April 2006, KKR scored one of its greatest coups when it listed KPE in Amsterdam. Demand was so strong that the offer was expanded from $1.5bn to $5bn. In many ways, the move was a declaration of independence. KKR would not every few years need to tap traditional investors such as pension funds. Nor would it have to share deals with other private equity firms, because it could use the $5bn it raised to write bigger cheques by itself.The flotation was also a pre-emptive strike. When groups such as Apollo Management and Doughty Hanson tried to follow, they had to scale back or abandon their offers in the face of inadequate demand. KKR had soaked up all the money.Mr Schwarzman (right) chafed at KKR’s Amsterdam coup. Then, just over a year after the KPE flotation, Blackstone caused a splash by announcing it was listing on the New York Stock Exchange. An ebullient Mr Schwarzman met investors in June last year at the Pierre Hotel in New York, under an ornate ceiling hung with balloons. He compared Blackstone pointedly to its competitors, noting it had never had a disaster like KKR with Regal Cinemas. Blackstone raised more than $7bn from its flotation at the top of the market, including $3bn from a new Chinese sovereign wealth fund, valuing the group at above $30bn.Mr Schwarzman and Peter Peterson, the other Blackstone founder, together cashed in $2.6bn of their stakes and left their rivals scrambling to catch up. KKR filed for its US initial public offering 11 days afterwards but it was too late: the credit bubble was about to burst.Blackstone shares have lost 40 per cent since their IPO, leaving many investors displeased. Nonetheless, by going public at the peak of the boom, Blackstone enjoyed a higher valuation than KKR is likely to receive when it lists in the fourth quarter. “Blackstone listed with great fanfare at the top of the market last year, but KKR is coming through a side door at the bottom of the market,” says Bill Barnard, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort.That sequence is mirrored in the approach the two houses took before the credit crisis set in. In 2005 and 2006, Blackstone accounted for 20 per cent of the largest private equity deals. But last year, concerned that prices were too high, it stepped back. Tony James, Blackstone’s president, told his staff to count on an economic slowdown in 2008 and 2009. The only deal among the top 20 that went to Blackstone last year was its $26bn purchase of Hilton Hotels.KKR had meanwhile exploited what Mr Kravis described as the “golden age” of private equity more aggressively than any other firm. It completed $200bn of deals in 2006 and 2007, more than any rival, snapping up blue chip companies at a rate of more than one a month, including Alliance Boots, the UK pharmacy chain, and First Data, the credit card processor. When KKR teamed up with TPG to buy TXU, the Texas energy utility, for $45bn, Mr Kravis gleefully told associates how enraged Blackstone was at being left out of the deal.KKR’s young partners were competing with each other, anticipating that one day the firm would go public. Rising stars such as Marc Lipschultz and Mr Nuttall in New York or Johannes Huth and Todd Fisher in London jostled to secure a larger share of the spoils based on the deals they did in the ultimate hope of being anointed successor to Mr Kravis and Mr Roberts.As a result of its listing, KKR hopes to be worth $15bn-$19bn – although KPE’s share price implies a more modest $11bn-$13bn. Mr Kravis proudly states that after the IPO, KKR will have $6.8bn of its own balance sheet invested in its funds, clearly putting his money where his mouth is. “It will make us the biggest investor in our own products by some margin,” he says.Still, KKR will be valued at a lower multiple of earnings than Blackstone, which is more diversified and has almost twice the assets under management. Blackstone’s real estate business is almost as profitable as its buy-out operations. It also earns fees from investing in hedge funds and advising on mergers and acquisitions. Mr Schwarzman once branded KKR a “one-trick pony” for its reliance on buy-outs.KKR is just starting to diversify and plans to use its shares for acquisitions to expand into infrastructure, property, public equities and mezzanine debt. Its first foray into the debt world was a flop. KKR was last year forced into a $270m bail-out of KKR Financial, a leveraged mortgage investment vehicle listed in New York. Meanwhile, Blackstone made a fortune short-selling subprime mortgages.Today, the credit crisis is accompanied by an economic slowdown in the US and Europe, raising severe doubts about the fate of many of the big recent buy-outs. These include some deals that KKR has already written down, such as NXP, the Dutch chipmaker, and ProSiebenSat.1, the German broadcaster. Moreover, KKR has done only three deals together worth $826m so far this year, less than 1 per cent of its 2007 activity, according to Dealogic, the data compiler. The group has dropped from first to 51st in Dealogic’s rankings by buy-out value.Once KKR and Blackstone are listed side by side in New York, comparisons between the two will inevitably increase, further fuelling the rivalry between their hard-driving bosses. All the signs are that in spite of Mr Schwarzman’s early lead and the difficult climate, Mr Kravis is far from conceding defeat.George Anson, managing director of HarbourVest, an investor in both Blackstone and KKR, says: “If people are keeping score, and I think they are, then this [listing in New York] was one thing that Blackstone had and KKR did not.”
286;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-07-29T12:30:19Z;Transparency rules hold no fears;;"Sir Michael Rake, the man charged with policing private equity’s new transparency rules, has secured the commitment of 32 buy-out groups and 55 of their portfolio companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary guidelines.Yet, while the British Telecom chairman is encouraged by the response to the new code, he warns that last year’s political firestorm over private equity could reignite quickly if a big buy-out collapsed.Private equity faced a barrage of accusations last year – from job-cutting and asset-stripping, to tax avoidance and excessive use of debt – after bidding for several FTSE 100 companies, such as Alliance Boots and J. Sainsbury, the high-street retailers.Sir Michael told the Financial Times that, even though the credit crunch had triggered a drop in the size and number of buy-outs, the pressure was still on buy-out firms to prove their value to the economy.“It has gone quiet for the moment,” says Sir Michael, in his first interview since being named chairman of the guidelines monitoring group for the new private equity rules in November. “But those who know understand it could easily come back.“If there were to be a major failure in a private equity-financed vehicle, then for sure there would be political attention,” he says. “This industry isn’t stupid and is fully aware this is something we need to do.”With the European parliament debating measures to clamp down on private equity, he warns that some European countries are making “ill-informed assumptions” about the industry. “That is a very dangerous place from which to make policy.”He is encouraged by the enthusiastic response eight months after Sir David Walker, the City grandee, unveiled the voluntary guidelines he drew up for the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (BVCA).Since then, about a dozen private equity firms – including Apax Partners, Terra Firma, Permira and Cinven – have published annual reviews, giving details of their senior managers, investors, strategies and portfolio companies.“The reports are worth looking at,” says Sir Michael. “They see the business benefits of doing it. There is nothing to fear from transparency and the story they have to tell is generally a good one; therefore why not tell it?”In addition, large portfolio companies, such as Alliance Boots, the pharmacy chain, and Gala Coral, the betting and casinos group, have published public company-style annual reports. By the end of the year, Sir Michael plans to report back on how the rules have been adopted by relevant portfolio companies – any listed companies acquired for more than £300m or unlisted companies for £500m-plus with more than 1,000 staff and generating at least half their revenues in the UK.By then he also expects to have held talks with a number of Middle Eastern and Asian sovereign wealth funds about complying with the guidelines. So far only Arcapita, the Bahrain-based Islamic bank, and Dubai International Capital, the Gulf investment fund, have signed up to the guidelines after acquiring large UK companies and becoming members of the BVCA. Both DIC and Arcapita raise money from private investors, so consider themselves more private equity than sovereign wealth funds. Yet other groups with closer government links, such as the Qatar Investment Authority, have not signed up, even though the QIA owns Four Seasons, the troubled UK nursing home operator.“I was in the Gulf a few weeks ago and the couple of people I spoke to informally indicated they were absolutely willing to go along with what everyone else does,” says Sir Michael. His group has appointed PwC to advise it on monitoring the compliance of portfolio companies and Ernst & Young to collate and publish “attribution analysis” data on how private equity groups make their profits.“To remove this from being a political and fiscal issue to more of a factual issue around where private equity sits in relation to the economy, the creation of jobs and long-term investment, the most important thing to is to get some clarity rather than noise around the facts,” says Sir Michael.His group has the power to expel any funds that do not comply with the guidelines from the BVCA. Yet, he says: “I think that is a real long backstop, but it is perhaps important to have it.”With the UK economy slowing and the financial system in difficulties, private equity’s new policeman sees as many opportunities as challenges for the industry. “We do need to understand that companies do go bust from time to time,” he says.“But the ability of private equity to manage through and create more value out of these assets when companies get into difficult situations is a big part of what they do.”"
287;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-07-29T00:36:43Z;Persuasion worked with many but not all;;Sir Michael Rake insists that when it came to persuading the 55 private equity-owned companies he thought should comply with new transparency guidelines, only very gentle nudging was needed before they all acquiesced.The companies include many of the best-known UK buy-outs: Alliance Boots, EMI Group, Birds Eye Iglo, Odeon & UCI Cinemas, United Biscuits, New Look, and Acromas (the recently merged AA/Saga).However, there were some notable omissions, such as Apollo Management of the US, which owns Countrywide, the UK’s biggest chain of estate agents, but is ignoring the guidelines.Other US private equity groups absent from the list include Hellman & Friedman – which bought Iris, the UK software group with more than 1,000 staff, for £500m last year – and JC Flowers, which has been toying with a £2bn bid for Friends Provident, the UK insurer. There are some surprising inclusions, such as Macquarie, the Australian infrastructure investor, which is not strictly a private equity investor, as it has no plans to sell its investments, which include Thames Water, National Car Parks, Wales & West Utilities and National Grid Wireless.Other foreign companies on the list include Annington Homes, the property group, and Autobahn Tank & Rast, the motorway service station operator, which are both German. Another – AWAS, the aircraft leasing company – is US-based.These are all owned by Terra Firma, the firm run by Guy Hands, the City dealmaker, who volunteered that they comply with the rules.Another surprise inclusion are three companies part-owned by HBOS.It agreed to comply on De Vere Group, the hotel operator, Keepmoat, the social housing builder, and Wyevale Garden Centres.
288;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Banks drop Ineos loan sale;;Banks have abandoned the €620m (£490m) sale of risky loans used by Ineos, one of the world’s biggest chemical companies, to fund an acquisition this year, in a sign the credit crunch is still making it difficult to sell debt.The failed debt syndication comes as the leveraged loan markets enter a new period of difficulty having enjoyed a brief respite during the months following the rescue of Bear Stearns, the US investment bank.In that time, banks were able to shift some of the loans they had provided for leveraged buy-outs before the credit crunch hit, which they were then unable to sell on.For example, in May, some of the underwriters of the Alliance Boots buy-out financing were able to sell a big chunk of the debt that had been on their books since last year.But the average bid of the most traded European leveraged loans has fallen 308 basis points from 91.7 per cent of face value during the past four weeks, according to data from S&P Leveraged Commentary and Data and Markit, the lowest level since April 3.Ineos, the UK’s biggest private company with sales approaching $45bn (£23bn), bought Norsk Hydro’s polymers business in February.Ineos declined to comment on the debt sale but said the financing was a standalone financing by Ineos Capital, a unit of Ineos, and there was no refinancing need by Ineos Group, which has about €8bn of debt according to Standard & Poor’s.Barclays Capital and Merrill Lynch, the underwriters of the financing, are in talks to change the terms of the debt facility, according to people involved.Banks first started the syndication more than a month ago but deteriorating market conditions and weak demand for companies in cyclical sectors, made the process difficult to complete.Ineos, like others in its industry, has been facing difficult market conditions in the face of rising oil prices and anticipated downturn in the petrochemicals sector, although it says it has a diversified business offering counter-cyclical protection.Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency, last month downgraded the outlook on its rating of Ineos’s debt on expected tight covenant leeway and liquidity, particularly in 2009.
289;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-07-27T16:55:40Z;UniCredit deputy looks to Italy;;Sergio Ermotti should be among the small band of bankers who are feeling upbeat.The deputy chief executive of UniCredit, who has responsibility for the Italian banking giant’s investment, corporate and private banking divisions, has weathered the credit crunch better than many of his peers.But in an interview with the Financial Times, the former Merrill Lynch executive is, nevertheless, cautious in tone as he lays out plans to build on the group’s advantages in the wake of the credit crunch.UniCredit has had its share of pain in the crisis.In the first quarter of this year, mark-to-market losses on asset-backed securities and structured debt products led to a €700m ($1.1bn) loss in its markets and investment banking unit, prompting the bank to abandon its €2bn profit target for the division for 2008.The group reports second quarter results this Friday, just weeks after another wave of writedowns at Wall Street counterparts.Rivals are quick to highlight that UniCredit is one of the few banks not to have taken charges against what is in its case €9.5bn of leveraged finance.Half the portfolio is residual positions on loans that the bank has made in the past, Mr Ermotti says.Most of the rest is debt in the private equity buy-outs of Alliance Boots, the pharmacist and healthcare chain, and Valentino, the fashion house.Several rival banks have sold their Alliance Boots debt at 92 per cent of its face value but Mr Ermotti insists that the debt is valuable.He says: “We understand more the people that have bought that paper than those that sold it, particularly those that provided financing to the buyers”.Mr Ermotti insists that there is nothing odd about UniCredit’s decision to treat leveraged loans as long-term commitments rather than trading assets – since it has always accounted for them in this way.He adds that UniCredit is among only a handful of European banks that fully charge losses on complex debt securities against profit rather than adjusting reserves.UniCredit entered the credit squeeze having completed large deals that gave it a geographic and business diversity that has cushioned the group during the crisis.Mr Ermotti, a Swiss-Italian and a close ally of Alessandro Profumo, UniCredit’s chief executive, has spent the past few years knitting into a coherent whole the corporate and investment banking businesses in Germany, Italy, Austria and central and eastern Europe.There is more housework to do – UniCredit bought Capitalia, the rival Italian lender, only last year – but Mr Ermotti is now also focusing on other opportunities created by the squeeze.The immediate challenge is on UniCredit’s home turf.About 1,000 corporate customers in Italy, roughly a quarter of the total, generate negative economic value added – a measure of profitability that factors in the cost of capital – for the bank.One of Mr Ermotti’s priorities is to reduce that number drastically.Ideally, these clients will respond to encouragement to buy a broader range of products.But Mr Ermotti is ready to cut them off if not – and, in an environment in which banks are reining in lending and the cost of credit is rising, that is a realistic threat.“We are more disciplined,” he says. “We have a different bargaining position.”UniCredit is also rethinking its broader strategy in markets and investment banking.Structured credit and proprietary trading are being scaled down in favour of areas in which it already has a competitive edge, such as using its geographic spread to provide cash management services.As a result, risk-weighted assets devoted to the business will be scaled back from €90bn in 2007 to €76bn by 2010.But UniCredit has also been on the offensive.Mr Ermotti has poached a team from New Smith Capital, the investment boutique in London that is led by TJ Lim, a veteran debt restructuring expert.Mr Lim will now co-head UniCredit’s markets operations with a remit to help clients clean up their exposures to the debris of the credit crunch.“Two to three years ago, [hiring this team] would have been impossible,”Mr Ermotti says. “We can go now with a degree of credibility and help institutions restructure their business.”Mr Ermotti concedes that the present strained environment ought – in theory – to be creating rare chances to expand the investment banking business by pouncing on weakened rivals.But he will not be drawn on targets, and points to Mr Profumo’s repeated statements that the bank is not contemplating any large deals at the current time.Besides, he adds, uncertainty over balance sheet valuations remains an obstacle to deals.“In this environment, to do a combination between investment banks would take a lot of [representations] and warranties,” he says.There are, it seems, times when even the UniCredit deal machine has to take a breather.
290;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-07-20T17:33:56Z;A diverse workforce makes business sense;;The gathering economic gloom should not obscure a fundamental truth of our time: the market remains the most successful engine of wealth creation known to humankind. This will come as no surprise to Financial Times readers. But when times get hard, business can quickly find itself under siege. Edward Heath’s “unacceptable face of capitalism”, the lampooning of 1980s “greed is good” and last year’s media assault on the private equity barons all show it is not difficult to find symbols with which to attack the market.For those of us who worry about equality, it would be all too easy to join in. Business still has plenty to do to instill fairness in the way it works. There is still a pay gap between women and men, there are still too few people from ethnic minorities in the higher echelons, disabled people are still too likely to be outside the world of work and we have yet to work out how best to use the skills of older workers. But the Equality and Human Rights Commission will not be joining the hunting party to seek capitalism’s demise.In a statement on our ambitions, published on Monday as “Fairness, A New Contract with the Public”, we recognise that the days of regarding business as a tolerated enemy are over. The call last week by Nicola Brewer, our chief executive, for a realistic assessment of the effect of employment laws that grant greater flexibility to mothers, is only the start of our programme to recalibrate thinking on equality.Equality and enterprise go hand-in-hand. Without enterprise there would be no opportunity for the disadvantaged to improve their standing. But without fairness, business would never benefit from the talents of many who do not fit the standard template. By 2010, just one-quarter of the UK’s full-time workforce will be white able-bodied men aged under 45. Some 80 per cent of jobs created in the past decade were filled by women. Between 2005 and 2009, half of the growth in the working-age population will have come from ethnic minority groups.This is why smart businesses are recognising that managing diversity is central to future success. Alex Gourlay, managing director of Boots The Chemists, part of Alliance Boots, last week called for tax breaks for companies that increase their diversity. BAA – not exactly the world’s favourite airport operator after the Terminal 5 debacle – is training workless people locally in order to improve its service delivery.Success in handling diversity will not depend on business alone – it is also the job of the education and training sector. But a modern equality regulator in tune with the needs of wealth creation can make a difference. The Equality and Human Rights Commission intends to be just that. We believe we can help business in several ways.First, we know that unless business can find people to do the work, it is forced to fall back on expensive imported labour. Our powers over the public sector enable us to bring pressure to drive up standards of education and skills. Working with Ofsted, the schools inspectorate, we intend to ensure nobody is excluded from the labour market for reasons of gender, race, disability or age.Second, we want to ensure that businesses understand how to hold on to their best people. I have seen chief executives of the old school swallow hard and march into receptions for minority graduates in the hope of snaring the brilliant young Asian trainees ahead of their rivals. The commission intends to expand its own networks to allow businesses to share ideas on how best to reach the top talent.Third, we will look for ways of rewarding success. We will publish data showing which companies are doing well and will aim, through awards and perhaps the Kitemark-type scheme proposed by the government, to identify organisations that are ahead of the pack. We will help to introduce rules that will ensure companies that take equality seriously gain a bigger slice of Britain’s £160bn annual public procurement budget.Fourth, we will make sure the law is simpler and clearer, by promoting a modern Equality Act that tells people what they can and cannot do on for, example, positive action. We will not rely on quotas and vast bundles of guidance and we resent paying lawyers to clog up the courts. But we will enable companies to move faster where it is in the public or consumer interest. We want to work with the tools of the market – accountability, transparency and competition – and we want change to come about through normal business methods: pressure from consumers and shareholders.The writer chairs the Equality and Human Rights Commission
291;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-07-17T02:42:21Z;Public ratings to lift market for risky loans;;The European market for risky loans used in private equity buy-outs will see public credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s from December, in a move expected to boost investor confidence and get money back into the markets.All new buy-outs worth more than €1bn ($1.58bn) will have to have public ratings on their loans from December, paid for by the borrower, the agency said on Wednesday.The move is a radical change from the current system of private so-called credit estimates, which are done on an ad-hoc basis for individual paying investors. If successful, it will push the European market much closer to the US model, although such changes could prove equally unpopular with private equity groups and investors.S&P said respondents to its long consultation process on loan market ratings had said that getting liquidity back to the market was crucial.“We are doing this because we believe formal ratings will serve the market better by providing our ratings and opinions, based on a direct relationship with the borrower, to all lenders across the whole market,” said Paul Drake, head of European leveraged finance and recovery. “We think that will support the long-term growth and stability of the market.”Andrew Roberts, a partner at law firm Travers Smith, which advised management of Alliance Boots on the £11bn ($22bn) deal that made it the largest ever European buy-out, said that private equity would ideally like to keep everything private, but that greater transparency was needed. “This should all be seen in the context of the push for greater transparency in private equity deals,” he said. “However, the private equity market had to do something to give confidence back to the debt syndication market.”S&P said that feedback during its consultation had differed across industry sectors. All the large banks that underwrite and sell such loans were neutral or positive, the agency said, while investors were more split, with about half supportive and one-quarter set against the changes.Private equity groups were generally more keen to not have any public measure of their companies’ performance and strength, the agency said.The European loan market was dominated by banks until only a few years ago. The first institutional investors prepared to lend to private equity companies began entering the market with the birth of the euro, but the explosive growth in the complex structured funds that helped drive the recent private equity boom only began three or four years ago.The existing system of credit estimates relies on investors in leveraged loans giving information to the agencies to get a point in time rating.Moody’s declined to comment. As for Fitch, Edward Eyerman, a managing director, said it “would encourage sponsors and arrangers to embrace more public transparency in the form of regular reporting and disclosure in line with a public listing, rather than have the broader market rely principally on rating actions based on private information”.
292;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-07-16T22:19:56Z;S&P to bring transparency to buy-outs;;Private equity groups will soon have more financial information disclosed publicly about the performance of the European companies they invest in under changes to Standard & Poor’s debt ratings.From December, S&P will give so-called public ratings for buy-outs with debt of more than €1bn in a move some investors and bankers hope will improve confidence and liquidity in the leveraged loan market.The step is a radical change from the current system of private so-called credit estimates done on an ad-hoc basis for individual paying investors. Fitch and Moody’s, the other main ratings agencies, have not announced any changes.Under the new S&P scheme, it will publicly disclose its rating and the rationale, including the prospects for recovery in the event of default.If successful, the change will push the European market much closer to the US model, although such moves could prove equally unpopular with private equity groups and investors. It would also make the loan market more like bond markets in which more public information is available.S&P said respondents to its consultation on loan market ratings had said that improving liquidity was crucial.“We are doing this because we believe formal ratings will serve the market better by providing our ratings and opinions, based on a direct relationship with the borrower, to all lenders across the whole market,” said Paul Drake, head of European Leveraged Finance & Recovery for S&P. “We think that will support the long-term growth and stability of the market.”Andrew Roberts, a partner at law firm Travers Smith, which advised management of Alliance Boots on the £11bn (€14bn) deal that made it the largest European buy-out, said that private equity would ideally like to keep everything private but that greater transparency was needed.“This should all be seen in the context of the push for greater transparency in private equity deals. However, the private equity market had to do something to give confidence back to the debt syndication market.”S&P said feedback during its consultation had differed across industry sectors.

293;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-07-08T18:32:48Z;Stability possible for leverage loans pricing as backlog declines;;The European leveraged loan market is showing new grounds for optimism in spite of the painful reality check dealt to prices in recent days, which has tainted the improvement in sentiment since the darkest days of February.The secondary market, where the risky loans that fund private equity buy-out deals are traded, saw a strong rally during the second quarter following the waves of forced selling in the first three months of this year.That recovery has helped banks to make long-awaited, though still heavily discounted sales of some of the debt from very large buy-out deals that were signed before the credit crisis struck, such as Alliance Boots and Endemol.Endemol was bought for an equity value of €3.1bn last June by Silvio Berlusconi’s Mediaset broadcasting group, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Cyrte Investments, a vehicle connected to John de Mol, the creator of the Big Brother franchise. Boots was the largest ever European buyout, an £11bn deal led by KKR and Stefano Pessina, the former company chairman.Standard & Poor’s LCD, the market data provider, estimates that the overhang from pre-July 2007 financings has been reduced to about €18bn from a peak of €28bn. The overall overhang from 2007 has been reduced from more than €50bn to €29bn.Importantly this stronger mood has been accompanied by a more calculated differentiation between the worth of different borrowers, according to a recent study by Standard & Poor’s.The ratings agency says buyers and sellers are now pricing leveraged loans more in line with the riskiness of individual deals with lower prices for riskier, lower rated loans.This is a dramatic shift from the pre-crunch days of last summer when loans were hot property and from the post-crunch days when the same loans became hot potatoes.Bankers and investors are hopeful that this recent stabilisation of trading and more rational pricing means improved visibility for the pricing of any potential new loan deals. This would help confidence to return among both lenders and private equity sponsors.“The pricing of leveraged loans in the secondary market has settled down and does more accurately reflect the credit risk of those borrowers,” says David Slade, European head of leveraged finance at Credit Suisse, adding that this would help bankers price new deals.The prices of loans in secondary markets swung wildly since last summer when they regularly traded above their face value, or par, due to the huge competition among investors to buy such debt. However, the loans in Europe hit a low of less than 86 per cent of par for average prices bid in March this year due to a wave of forced sales by investors who had borrowed money to fund their bets.The economic outlook fears that hit equities and other credit markets last week also dragged European loans down from recent highs of almost 92 per cent of par to nearer 91 per cent, according to data from S&P LCD and Markit.Potentially more important than the overall mood in the markets is the differentiation in pricing between the relative riskiness of different deals. Recent research from S&P says loan prices in the secondary market are more in line with their probability of default than even before last summer.Before the credit crunch, when hedge funds and other institutional investors were climbing over each other to buy every new deal, there was very little differentiation between borrowers. Absurdly, in some cases, investors were paying more for riskier debt.The rating agency has tracked the differential in price investors are willing to pay for leveraged loans between a single B and a stronger double B rating. Since the credit crunch hit, that spread has increased dramatically.The so-called credit curve of rising prices from riskier to stronger loans that this has created in the secondary market will help to give bankers and investors a much stronger idea of the kind of risk premiums they should consider when assessing new deals.S&P’s report does not indicate whether the prices that investors are paying are correct, but it implies that the pricing is more rational. The analysts believe that “in a market struggling to recover from a liquidity crisis, a differentiation in secondary pricing based on credit risk is an encouraging sign”.There have been a few new buy-outs over the past year but much of the debt successfully sold in recent months comes from the overhang of deals agreed before the credit crunch hit. Many European banks had until recently been slower than their US counterparts to try to shift their backlog of unsold deals, but have acted more aggressively as writedowns on those exposures have begun to bite.The volume of new leveraged loans in the first six months has tumbled to a five-year low in Europe according to S&P LCD, after the credit crunch brought the booming market for heavily indebted private equity buy-out deals to a grinding halt last summer.However, the latest S&P LCD data show that the second quarter saw the largest volume of new loans coming to market since last summer with banks selling more than €20bn worth of leveraged buy-out debt in the three months to the end of June.This compares with less than €10bn in the first quarter and between €15bn and €18bn in each of the previous two quarters. However, the second quarter total is less than one-third the new deal volume in the same period last year, which represented the peak of the buy-out boom.
294;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-06-29T17:36:54Z;Barclays’ debt treatment questioned;;Ever since the credit crisis started, Barclays has been the subject of intense speculation from investors trying to gauge the British bank’s exposure to the turmoil. In recent months, its method of accounting for some debt instruments on its balance sheet has become the main topic of debate between the bank and its critics.The debate flared up again last week when, in the wake of Barclays’ £4.5bn share issue, analysts at Citigroup pointed to what they describe as the bank’s “unusual” accounting practices.This year, Barclays has written off just £1.7bn on the value of complex debt securities stuck on its balance sheet, less than many of its rivals. Executives believe this demonstrates the bank’s superior risk management.But the Citigroup analysts contrasted the approach with that of Royal Bank of Scotland, its main UK rival, which wrote off almost £6bn earlier this year. If Barclays adopted what the analysts described as “RBS-style writedowns”, it would have lost a further £7bn, and would need more capital than it has raised so far.The debate has frustrated Barclays executives, who point out that the bank’s books have been carefully checked by its new investors, its auditors, and by the investment banks sponsoring the share offering.People close to the bank argue it is wrong to apply RBS’s valuations to Barclays’ assets, because there are big differences between the two. They also point out that, if the bank was at all concerned about its balance sheet, last week would have been the ideal moment to recognise more losses.The debate centres on the way Barclays treats its £7.5bn portfolio of loans to private equity groups. These so-called leveraged loans, agreed at the peak of the credit bubble, have been on the bank’s balance sheet since the credit crisis struck. For accounting purposes, Barclays treats these loans as if it was holding them for their duration. This means it must only revalue them if the borrower runs into difficulty. So far, Barclays has barely written off anything.This approach is in stark contrast with other investment banks, most of which are required to value their leveraged loans according to their market value. Rivals including Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have marked down the value of their loans and sold some of them to investors.As a result, loans in which Barclays has participated are now trading at a large discount to their face value. The biggest sale of a European hung leveraged loan to date was the €2.5bn (£1.9bn) sale of senior debt backing the buy-out of Alliance Boots, the European pharmacy group, which was sold at 91 per cent of its face value. Only Barclays and UniCredit, the Italian bank, decided not to sell their share.Recently, Barclays opted out of the sale of €1.1bn of senior debt backing the buy-out of Endemol, the media group. Other banks sold the debt at a 30 per cent discount to face value.People close to the bank point out that, of the remaining £5bn of leveraged debt on Barclays’ books, 65 per cent is in the debt of Alliance Boots and AA/Saga, the merger of the motoring group and the senior citizens’ organisation, both of which are performing well.These people estimate that, if Barclays’ leveraged debt were marked to market prices, the bank would have to write off no more than £300-£400m.However, the approach is not without its costs. Keeping loans on its book ties up capital, limiting the scope for Barclays to take advantage of wider spreads by underwriting new loans.Moreover, in valuing its leveraged loans, Barclays has raised suspicions it may be taking a different approach in valuing other parts of its balance sheet, such as complex structures backed by US mortgages, and debt insured by US monoline bond insurers.Barclays executives insist the bank’s accounting is conservative and prudent. However, until the true value of leveraged loans made at the top of the market becomes clear, the questions are likely to persist.

Geographic diversification into eastern Europe and beyond helped offset sluggish market conditions in much of western Europe.At the reported level, the group fell to a pre-tax loss of £64m after finance costs of £853m. “Fundamentally we are very confident about servicing our debt,” said George Fairweather, finance director.Mr Pessina was also sanguine about the problems Alliance Boots’ banks have had syndicating the £8.5bn of debt. “This was not our problem; it was the problem of the banks,” he said. “We were very sorry for them. Our sorrow was not at the level to keep us awake at night, so we were able to concentrate our effort on the business.”Dominic Murphy, a partner at KKR, who led the deal for the private equity group, said its sister company KKR Financial was still considering buying some of the outstanding discounted debt. “My view is that’s a great buy and they should consider it,” he said.Mr Murphy acknowledged that the interest bill was “material” but said that £1.1bn of cash flow, which he believed would increase in coming years, was more than adequate to invest in stores, consider new acquisitions and pay the interest bill. He said: “The business does not have a requirement to repay any of the debt in the first eight years …It’s an interest-only mortgage.”"
296;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-06-10T19:16:30Z;Kazakhs edge closer to inevitable end-game;;"Let’s play power politics. I am Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan and ultimate arbiter of who gets the mining licences; you are a director of Kazakhmys, the former state-controlled mining company. Who holds the cards in a negotiation about how to exploit my country’s resources?Some day, the story of how a Kazakh national mining champion evolved will be written. It will tell how in the 1990s, state assets were privatised and divvied up between enterprises that eventually became Kazakhmys and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation. How the two companies floated on the London Stock Exchange. And how, in the end, the Kazakh government used the tools of the City to broker a merger.In this yet-to-be-completed saga, the chapter about Tuesday’s reshuffle of the Kazakh government’s investment will be pivotal. The deal appears to favour Kazakhmys to lead any future consolidation. By paying for its purchase of part of the Kazakh government’s stake in ENRC in its own shares, Kazakhmys brings the state on to its shareholder register, too. If the government now presses to get a delegate on the Kazakhmys board, to mirror its representation at ENRC, that will expose a potential conflict of interest.None of this need yet worry minority shareholders unduly. The share prices of both companies indicate that everybody has benefited. It is to the credit of Kazakhmys and ENRC that they have submitted themselves to City rules. It is not in Kazakhstan’s interest, as a country that wishes to attract investment and show it is a modern economy, to squander that credit.But be under no illusion. Backing these companies is like investing alongside any founder shareholder. For all the governance gold-plating, Kazakhmys and ENRC’s destiny is out of minority investors’ hands. Their boards may spar, but non-executives’ ability to resist an eventual combination will be limited if the Kazakh government desires it. At that point if these directors want to earn a footnote in history, they will simply have to ensure the terms of the inevitable deal are just.Boots is open all hoursWhen Stefano Pessina and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts took over Alliance Boots last year, they made some promises that seemed rash, given the fierce criticism being levelled at private equity buy-outs. Among them were pledges to make the group’s annual reviews a benchmark for openness and to use the new structure to accelerate integration, expand operations and even create jobs. How have the new owners measured up?Pretty well. To have fluffed the review would have been unforgivable, but Alliance Boots has gone beyond what the Walker report on transparency by private equity companies suggests. It helps that the underlying performance is strong. Deep in the statement, the group records a pre-tax loss for the year, after paying the £853m interest bill, but earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation rose 18 per cent to £1.12bn. In the current climate, that is a result any company, public or private, would consider worth publicising.With Mr Pessina in full control, the initial goal for cost savings from the 2006 Alliance UniChem-Boots merger has also been achieved with well over a month to spare. Furthermore, the company has added a net 5,000 new jobs, half in Britain, and is pursuing international growth plans.At the time, this looked like the first of many such high-profile deals in the UK. In fact, it was the high-water mark. The bare figures – an £11bn transaction that left the group with £8.6bn of debt – now make one gasp at the buyers’ daring. Fickle politicians and unions, having laid into the private equity industry last summer, have moved on to other prey. But knowing what we now know about credit conditions and the economic outlook, KKR and Mr Pessina’s continuing commitment to transparency looks even more important than it did a year ago.Floundering at low tideRescuers are struggling to save a pod of housebuilders after the largest mass stranding in nearly two decades. Distressed witnesses described “carnage” as the creatures thrashed about in dwindling liquidity yesterday.Scientists speculated that the animals, frightened by the detonation of the credit crisis and unsettled by short-sellers exercising off the London Stock Exchange, had fled, only to beach on their own land banks. It may be hard to resuscitate some of the stricken builders, which travel in groups, feed on homebuyers, and communicate using high-pitched whingeing about the mortgage market.Experts cautioned the public against approaching the wounded creatures. “It’s natural to be sympathetic, but remember they brought it on themselves by mating at the peak of the cycle,” explained one. “They’re pretty dumb – unlike dolphins.”andrew.hill@ft.com"

298;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-06-08T21:48:36Z;Alliance Boots to report hefty profit increase;;Alliance Boots, the health and beauty group that last year became the subject of Europe’s largest leveraged buy-out, is expected to report a large increase in profit tomorrow.Bankers believe the company will announce a pre-tax profit of £770m at the end of a successful year for the company, which was bought by Stefano Pessina and KKR for an enterprise value of £12.1bn, and a bumpier year for banks backing the deal that were left with unsyndicated debt.The group has also switched its headquarters from Nottingham to Switzerland, a move that the company said symbolises its transformation into a global health group, but that will inevitably invite comparisons with Shire Pharmaceuticals and other companies that have exiled themselves for tax reasons.There are not, however, any large tax gains expected from Alliance Boots’ switch and nor is the traditional Nottingham base being axed. Instead, Mr Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, believes that Switzerland is a more fitting and convenient location.If Alliance Boots meets the £770m level of profits that is now widely expected, compared with £510m a year earlier, it will have exceeded the expectations of analysts for the year to March, even against the current backdrop of tighter consumer spending.In his first interview since conducting the deal, Mr Pessina told the Financial Times last month that cash would be invested back in the group rather than used for paying down debt or paying dividends.“Our intention is to invest all the cash we are able to generate, which is quite substantial after we have paid the interest back, of course, back into the business,” he said. “It is not just me personally, which is obvious, but even KKR are not interested [in a dividend] for the time being.“We have bought a business which is underinvested and the first thing we have to do as responsible shareholders and managers is to make sure that the business is competitive.”Mr Pessina said that Alliance Boots would spend up to £1bn in the coming three years on capital expenditure.
299;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Discounted deals remain available for private equity;;For all the talk of a credit crunch, private equity groups still have money burning a hole in their pockets. They raised $500bn last year, and although some of that cash was put to work, there is still a large chunk waiting to be invested. But the question is where?Clearly, buyouts on the scale of last year’s £11bn takeover of Alliance Boots are firmly off the agenda. The world’s biggest banks still have billions of buyout debt on their books and until that is shifted, and their balance sheets repaired, they won’t be backing any mega-deals.However, there are a number of options open to the fee-hungry buyout executives, according to Citigroup. Some have interesting implications for the London market.One option is to take strategic stakes. This happened on Monday when TPG announced plans to invest £179m for a 23 per cent stake in Bradford & Bingley, the troubled specialist mortgage lender.Another is to target small cap companies where finance for deals is still available. This is generally reckoned to be for companies with a market capitalisation of less than £500m. Only last week, Carlyle revealed it was considering a bid for Filtronic, a maker of microwave and radio frequency components.A third option, yet to been seen in the UK, is to acquire leverage – or buy companies that already have large amounts of debt compared to their equity’s market value.Two candidates immediately spring to mind: Yell, publisher of the Yellow Pages, and Premier Foods, which makes Branston pickle and Hovis bread. Both are heavily indebted, and both have private equity backgrounds.There are options away from the quoted company arena, such as buying leveraged loans at big discounts. Oaktree Capital Management has just raised $10.9bn for the world’s biggest distressed debt fund, for example.But perhaps the most interesting option is to provide equity to distressed companies.Although TPG’s investment in B&B has generated a lot of anger – the stake will be acquired at a deeply discounted price – there is good reason to think this deal will be repeated.One consequence of the problems in the banking sector is tighter lending standards, according to Citigroup. Fewer companies are likely to get cash on the terms they want, so will turn to the equity market for money.However, the volume of rights issues has been such that the institutions who underwrite these cash calls could soon suffer fatigue.So far this year, a total of £22.8bn has been raised through rights issues in the UK, more than any previous annual total since 1980, according to UBS, which thinks the desire to fund these issues is likely to wane.So which companies might need private equity help to underwrite a fund raising?UBS has compiled a list based on a methodology from Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency. This includes a number of debt and coverage ratios, such as interest cover and free operating cash flow to debt. Companies which score poorly on a combination of these measures include Kingfisher, Debenhams, Pennon, Rexam, National Grid, United Utilities, Mitchells & Butlers, Punch Taverns, BBA, Tate & Lyle and Rentokil Initial.Alongside those companies, traders believe there will be cash calls in the housebuilding sector. Indeed, Apollo, the US buyout group, is reported to have approached Barratt Developments, which is heavily indebted, with an offer for a large minority stake.It will also be extremely difficult to get away another rights issue in the banking sector after the B&B fiasco. So if Alliance & Leicester decides to tap the market for cash if may need a fund such as TPG to underwrite the issue.For private equity, such investments obviously lack the glamour of a leveraged buyout, but they do have a number of advantages. Buying whole companies requires a premium to be paid. This is not the case in rescue situations as B&B shareholders can testify. If the stake is large enough, there is the prospect of board representation. TPG will get two seats on the B&B board.If the rights issues keep coming, then the likes of TPG will appear on the share registers of many more quoted companies.
300;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-06-06T18:42:58Z;Barclays Capital makes staff cuts;;Barclays Capital has become the latest bank to trim staff as the investment banking industry reels from the global credit crunch.The bank has been reallocating staff around its different arms, but slightly fewer than 100 in London were informed yesterday that they would be involved in a round of redundancies.The cuts will be in the investment banking division and information technology support. The investment banking division is focused on financing mergers and acquisitions activity, the level of which has dropped since the collapse of the US subprime mortgage market.The cut is small relative to the bank’s global workforce of 16,500. Its leveraged finance team, which has been involved in financing some of the UK’s biggest buy-outs, such as Alliance Boots, will shrink.The move highlights that even banks not forced to make large write-offs on their leverage loan books are looking to downscale their financing businesses, as M&A activity is likely to remain lower than previously.
301;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-05-30T22:27:41Z;Jeremiahs crowd the UK high street;;"The archetypal Jeremiah wandering high streets with “the end is nigh” painted on a sign is more cheerful than most shopkeepers at the moment.After years of consumer-led growth, non-food retail chief executives are in the doldrums. Sales are falling, consumer confidence is non-existent and share price performance is best not mentioned.Remarkably, though, some of the gloomiest equity strategists say we may soon see some bargains in the sector. With the 12-month share price performance at its lowest level in 30 years, the theory goes that things cannot get much worse for retail, at least from a share price perspective.Graham Secker, of Morgan Stanley, is one formerly bearish analyst – “it feels like we’ve been negative on this space forever,” he says – going through a “big change” of heart.A moderately upbeat research report from Mr Secker yesterday helped lift the sector.“We believe we are getting close to the trough for retailers’ share price performance and recommend that investors consider closing shorts,” the report said.“In the last recession, the sector troughed at the same time as consumer confidence bottomed; the latter could easily happen in the next quarter given the cacophony of bad news flow seen in the last few weeks.”The argument is that while things are bad, they may not be quite as bad as share prices indicate.Retail has underperformed the wider market by 30 per cent in the past year and the era of cheap money – as used on the £12.4bn acquisition of Alliance Boots – has come to an end.“The fundamentals for the consumer do not look good,” says Mr Secker. But he believes a sector price/earnings ratio of about 9 based on the most recent financial results, also the lowest level in 30 years, means a high risk, high return bet on a share price recovery could be tempting, especially as dividend yields also look attractive.It is a suggestion strongly disputed by one of Britain’s leading retail executives, who declines to be named.“How could you possibly be calling the retail sector? Absolutely impossible. Nobody at the moment can tell you where the revenue line is going.”The executive, whose views are shared widely by his peers, predicts that “most of the high street will be on sale at the end of June”.He says that a poisonous mix of rising costs for both the consumer and retailer – from the minimum wage, stronger euro and inflation in China – is contributing to a malaise that shows no sign of lifting.It is not surprising that corporate restructuring specialists are hovering.“We’re going to see a ‘right-sizing’ of the retail market,” says Robin Knight, a director at Kroll, sounding a slightly chilling note for the industry.MK One, the discount fashion chain, lapsed into administration this year after it was sold by Baugur, the Icelandic investment group, to Hilco, a retail restructuring specialist. After the sale, it was quickly placed into administration and the bulk of the business sold to the company’s founder, Mark Brafman.The MK One model, with beleaguered store chains quickly being transferred to different ownership rather than disappearing permanently, is a pattern many in the restructuring business believe will continue.“We will see insolvencies but lots of retail phoenixes that just reappear,” says Mr Knight.At the other end of the spectrum is John Lewis, a department store chain that likes to think of itself as different.It is a much-loved fixture in the lives of many middle-class families, offers better service than the competition, is owned by its workers and regularly outperforms the competition.Except that it is no longer quite so different.Trading at the chain last week was poor. The consumer gloom has hit the retailer that previously could do little wrong.Sales fell for the third consecutive week, by 2.8 per cent in the week to May 24. This was better than much of the high street but, at £44.3m, the worst performance in two years at John Lewis during this period.“We are in a customer downturn,” says Dan Knowles, director of selling operations at John Lewis. He highlights a GfK/NOP poll published yesterday that shows British consumer confidence in May at its lowest level since 1990.“Pretty sober reading,” he says.Different areas of retail have reacted differently to the incipient downturn. Drinkers are not yet forgoing their favourite tipple and drivers who can afford to fill their tanks will continue to buy new wiper blades too. Therefore, Halfords and Majestic should weather the downturn relatively well.And for Mr Secker and other softening bears, the gloomy consumer data do not rule out retail shares being too cheap. His evidence includes the fact that retail stocks reached their nadir in the early 1990s, when house prices started to fall, rather than later on in the downturn.Regardless, for those on the retail front line, such as Sir Stuart Rose at Marks and Spencer and Sir Philip Green at Arcadia, there is far less optimism.They may be wearing suits rather than sandwich boards, but the message is clear: the end is not nigh, it has arrived."
302;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
303;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-05-27T20:21:13Z;KKR and Pessina constrained on refinancing;;"Back in 2007 when deals were still being done, private equity houses had an appetite for retail businesses.All those daily shopping trips translated into reliable cash flow, which in turn funded deals and provided fuel for big pay-outs.In the case of Alliance Boots, the potential bonanza looked particularly promising; £471m of cash generated from its almost 3,000 retail outlets in six months alone, according to the last published accounts from 2006.This year will probably have been even better with legions of shoppers queuing round the block to get their hands on a pot of Alliance Boots’ award-winning anti-aging serum. And yet, the owners KKR and Stefano Pessina, who each invested about £1.3bn of equity to fund the £12.4bn deal, have made it clear that they are not thinking about taking even a penny out of Alliance Boots for the foreseeable future, strong cash flow or not.Mr Pessina and KKR say that the decision to reinvest all the cash – they will also have a rather sizeable interest charge on £9bn of debt – rather than beginning to pay down debt, is all about the long-term health of Alliance Boots.But it is also surely about reputational risk. Alliance Boots’ new owners must have been caught off guard late last year when a statutory announcement over a £1.55bn dividend payment from one component of the new group structure raised eyebrows.The cash remained in the group, but the scrutiny will have reminded Mr Pessina and Dominic Murphy, KKR partner, of the added responsibilities that come with being the architects of Europe’s biggest buy-out.And what of those other “stakeholders”, the banks who lent Alliance Boots the money to fund the deal? How would they react if the shareholders tried to pay themselves chunky dividends when they have had to cut their losses and offload the debt at a discount?In markets like these, KKR would find it very hard to strike a refinancing deal. But whether Mr Pessina and KKR can fund a pay-out from Alliance Boots’ cash flow is a moot point. In this particular deal, they cannot afford the controversy of even trying it out.Wisdom of SolomonThe shareholders of Moss Bros would do well to dig out the tale of King Solomon.In the old testament story, the ruler is presented with two women claiming to be the mother of the same baby. Faced with competing claims, Solomon decides to split the child in two.The real mother, horrified, gives up her claim so the child can live.Moss Bros’s main shareholders – Baugur, Laura Ashley and the Moss and Gee families – have been locked in battle for months over the future of the men’s wear retail chain. There was another marker in this acrimonious battle on Tuesday when Icelandic investor Baugur pulled the plug on a 42p a share indicative offer.That approach – already aggressively opposed by the Moss and Gee families – was dead in the water once rival Laura Ashley began hoovering up stock at 46p a share.But these developments do little to clear muddied waters.Now, the management and other shareholders will be waiting to see whether Baugur, which has a 29 per cent stake, will come back with another approach in six months’ time.Meanwhile, Laura Ashley could be waiting in the wings, having bought up just under 10 per cent of the retailer in an effort to scotch Baugur.As the stalemate continues, the business goes sideways, recording an annual loss earlier this year on the back of sluggish sales.The impending departure of chairman Keith Hamill in the coming weeks is yet another challenge for an already weary management team.In the story of King Solomon, the real mother gets her child back in the end, its value intact. Moss Bros’s shareholders, hell bent on the battle for control, are in danger of missing that chance.Per Ardua ad AstraSetting aside £18m of company money to buy a corporate jet in such turbulent times suggests Richard Desmond really does live by Northern & Shell’s motto “forti nihil difficile” (nothing is difficult for the brave).Buying a transatlantic runaround is certainly a bold move when the US edition of OK! has yet to turn a profit after spending heavily on celebrity exclusives such as Jamie Lynn Spears’ pregnancy.With that in mind, perhaps the Royal Air Force’s motto, “Per Ardua ad Astra” (through adversity to the stars) would be a better tag for his subsonic ambitions.elizabeth.rigby@ft.com"
304;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-05-26T21:45:38Z;Boots chief to reinvest profits;;"The businessmen behind Europe’s biggest ever private equity deal are refraining from taking cash out of Alliance Boots this year, choosing instead to plough any profits back into the pharmacy chain.Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of the retail and wholesale company, which he took private with the help of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in an £11.1bn buy-out last June, told the Financial Times he was not planning to take any cash out for two years or more.“There is no intention to pay a dividend,” the billionaire businessman said. “Our intention is to invest all the cash we are able to generate – which is quite substantial after we have paid the interest back, of course – back into the business.“It is not just me personally, which is obvious, but even KKR are not interested for the time being. We have bought a business which is under-invested and the first thing we have to do as responsible shareholders and managers is to make sure the business is
competitive.”Mr Pessina said that Alliance Boots would use up to £1bn in the coming three years on capital expenditure. The company has already spent more than £100m in the past year opening 140 new pharmacies – 50 of them outside the UK – and is also planning to roll out Boots-branded products, such as Soltan suncream, across Europe.But the company, which will unveil its results for the year to March in the coming weeks, will have to pay a hefty interest bill on its £9bn debt, which it raised just before the credit crunch to fund the deal.In his first interview since the deal, Mr Pessina acknowledged that he had been very lucky to have got it away. Soon after it was completed in June, ­turmoil in the credit markets made it almost impossible for private equity to raise money for any deals – especially in the retail sector – as confidence among investors and consumers waned.“This [correction] happened quite suddenly,” said Mr Pessina. “If we had been able to close the deal just two or three weeks earlier than we did, the banks would have been able to sell on the debt. Our banks were very unlucky, I have to say.”The banks that funded the deal have been sitting on the vast majority of the debt over the past year, unable to syndicate it to other investors because of the credit squeeze.Although some of the banks are now on the brink of offloading about £3bn of the loans as they attempt to clear up their balance sheets, they are being forced to sell the debt at a substantial discount to its original value."
305;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-05-26T21:15:15Z;Pessina steers new course for pharmacy chain’s future;;"Had the merger of Stefano Pessina’s drugs wholesale business and Boots, Britain’s best-known pharmacy chain, gone to plan back in 2006, the Italian billionaire would probably now be spending his days relaxing in his home in Monaco or sailing along the Sardinian coastline on his yacht.Instead, the 66-year-old is travelling all over the world – he closed a deal in China earlier this year and is now eyeing Latin America and India – as the executive chairman and driving force behind the privately owned Alliance Boots.“If I had been happy after the [Alliance Unichem] merger with Boots, I would have finished my career, my goal,” says Mr Pessina, who acquired the business with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for £12.4bn ($24.6bn) in 2007. The deal – Europe’s largest leveraged buy-out – came less than a year after orchestrating the merger of the two businesses.Back in the driving seat as executive chairman and part-owner, the Italian-born businessman is much happier with how things are going now.“I always said that I thought the [merger] deal we did would accelerate our strategy,” he says, speaking from Alliance Boots’ Oxford Street head offices.“I took the view that we could accelerate this [further] and I seized the opportunity when I realised I could find a way. Now I am realising what I thought is correct.”Next month, Mr Pessina will tell stakeholders how the business, which has 2,900 retail shops and distributes drugs across Europe, is faring under private ownership as he delivers his first annual review.It is an important moment for Alliance Boots’ owners. They are the architects of the first leveraged buy-out of a FTSE 100 company. Their management of one of Britain’s oldest brands under private ownership will be watched carefully.In his first interview since he took the business private last summer, Mr Pessina is keen to show he is mindful of that responsibility.He is clear that both he and KKR, who jointly own the business, will not be earning vast financial rewards from the deal yet. There will be no dividend payment this year or the next.“KKR are not in a hurry, they know this business will grow for many, many years,” he says.Mr Pessina put £1.27bn of his fortune into the company when the deal closed, after making £1.67bn from his 16 per cent stake in Alliance Boots at the time of the takeover.“Over the next three years we have a very intense plan and it is not to extract cash,” says Mr Pessina.“We have lots of projects in our plan and I can tell you that the size of investment will be close to £1bn.”But how much the plans really have been accelerated is hard to read. Mr Pessina gives few concrete examples. The only significant development he can point to is the meshing of the Alliance Unichem and Boots pharmacy management teams.“If I had been in charge [at the time of the merger], I would have tried to do this at the first point,” says Mr Pessina.“The integration process of the two retail arms started two weeks after privatisation because we put in place a new executive team [following the departure of Richard Baker and Scott Wheway from Boots] and they had a clear brief.”By Christmas 2009, nearly all the 2,500 outlets in the UK and Ireland will be under the Boots brand.Mr Pessina also plans to “disentangle” the Boots manufacturing business, which makes many of the retail chain’s beauty products and over-the-counter medicines, from the Boots chain to see if it can thrive on an independent basis.The division has struggled ever since Boots sold a collection of its healthcare brands, including Nurofen and Clearasil.Mr Pessina concedes that he might have to sell its
Nottingham-based factories eventually.“It is not our preferred option,” he says.“We need to make it a proper division and run it like that in order to develop it.“Our preferred option would be to expand …Now we are relatively competitive but if we become uncompetitive we would have to take a decision.”During the rest of 2008, Mr Pessina will be looking at more deals in the wholesale business following Alliance Boots’ £41m joint venture investment in China.He says that he is looking at “all the big countries” in Asia and Latin America. India is also among his target territories.With that in mind, Mr Pessina may well be the other side of 70 when he can retire to his yacht for good.“I hope it won’t take five years to do all this,” he says. “Let’s see how things develop.”"
306;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-05-26T21:15:15Z;Alliance Boots’ buyers spurn dividend;;The businessmen behind Europe’s biggest private equity deal are refraining from taking cash out of Alliance Boots this year, choosing instead to plough any profits back into the pharmacy chain.Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of the retail and wholesale company, which he took private with the help of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in an £11.1bn ($22bn) buyout last June, told the Financial Times he was not planning on taking any cash out for at least two years.“There is no intention to pay a dividend,” the billionaire businessman said.“Our intention is to invest all the cash we are able to generate, which is quite substantial after we have paid the interest back of course, back into the business.“It is not just me personally, which is obvious, but even KKR are not interested for the time being.“We have bought a business which is underinvested and the first thing we have to do as responsible shareholders and managers is to make sure that the business is competitive.”Mr Pessina said that Alliance Boots would spend up to £1bn in the coming three years on capital expenditure.The company has already spent more than £100m in the past year opening 140 pharmacies – 50 of which were opened outside the UK – and is also planning to roll out Boots-branded products, such as Soltan suncream, across Europe.But the company, which will unveil its results for the year to March in the coming weeks, will have to pay a hefty interest bill on its £9bn debt, which it raised just before the credit crunch to fund the deal.In his first interview since the deal, Mr Pessina acknowledged that he was very lucky to have got it away.Soon after the deal was completed in June, turmoil in the credit markets made it almost impossible for private equity to raise money for any deals – especially in the retail sector – as confidence among investors and consumers waned.“This [correction] happened quite suddenly,” said Mr Pessina.“If we had been able to close the deal just two or three weeks earlier than we did, the banks would have been able to sell on the debt. Our banks were very unlucky I have to say.”The banks that funded the deal have been sitting on the vast majority of the debt over the past year, unable to syndicate it to other investors because of the credit squeeze.Though some of the banks are now on the brink of offloading about £3bn of the loans as they attempt to clear up their balance sheets, they are being forced to sell the debt at a substantial discount to its original value.
307;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-05-20T22:07:32Z;Record for Alliance Boots’ sale of debt;;Banks holding £9bn of debt from the private equity acquisition of Alliance Boots are on the brink of selling about a third of the loans in what would be the biggest sale of a hung leveraged loan in Europe.Banks have received orders for slightly less than half of the £5bn senior tranche of debt, at a price of 91 per cent of face value, according to several people familiar with the situation.Some of the banks have helped partially finance some investor’s orders. Yet, one person close to the banking syndicate said: “The deal is by no means finalised. It is still a work in progress and is yet to be signed, sealed and delivered.”Barclays and UniCredit have decided not to sell any of their share of the debt at these discounted prices, and JPMorgan is selling only part of its share the debt.Just under £2.5bn of the senior debt has been put up for sale and £650m of the £1bn of second lien debt tranche. Goldman Sachs’ Mezzanine fund has stepped in to buy that chunk of the second-lien loan at a price of 85 per cent of face value.Standard & Poor’s Leveraged Commentary and Data service says some €55bn ($86bn) of debt backing European leveraged loans still needs to be sold by banks.
308;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-05-19T08:15:22Z;A short ruse;;When buyers vanish from a market, sellers need to get creative. The banks have struggled to offload loans made to support leveraged buy-outs during the credit boom. One of the latest ruses is to target alternative asset managers, lending them the cash to buy a portfolio of loans at steep discounts to face value. A slice of the £9bn debt backing the buy-out of Alliance Boots should get away soon via this technique. The banks say they are mucking out the balance sheets, freeing scarce capital. But it looks like little more than window dressing as it represents an imperfect transfer of risk.The LBO debt is moved off-balance sheet, yes, but only into a special purpose vehicle. Typically a quarter of the funding for this will be equity supplied by the buyer and the rest is non-recourse debt from the bank. As with a mortgage, if the borrower cannot service that loan, the bank would have to foreclose while hoping that the underlying asset – the LBO debt – is still worth more than the loan made against it. The banks have marked down the value of credits already, typically to between 88 and 92 cents in the dollar, so they do not expect to be taking these assets back. But the possibility remains.Second, as that new loan still has to be funded, the impact on capital ratios is not quite as great as billed. Take a big portfolio of LBO debt, worth say £5bn. Under Basel II standards, a bank might have to hold £600m of capital against that. Assuming a loan to the buyer of 75 per cent of the value, the capital saving would be a mere £150m. And those capital charges will still go up, of course, if the underlying company servicing the debt becomes substantially less creditworthy.It is no coincidence that it is the most capital-constrained banks – Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland – that are doing most of this vendor financing. In this environment, every little helps.Post and read comment on this Lex
309;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-05-15T04:14:12Z;Nottingham to levy employers for car parking;;Nottingham is set to introduce a car parking levy on employers, the most significant anti-traffic measure since London brought in its congestion scheme.Councillors in the east Midlands city have agreed to the levy, which will raise up to £11m ($21m) a year from companies, as a way to fund public transport improvements.Business leaders have criticised the project, which falls on the largest 500 employers in Nottingham. From 2010 all will have to pay £185 a year for each car parking space they provide, rising to £350 in 2014.Shoppers, tourists and other visitors will not have to pay any extra charge to leave their cars in Nottingham. The council hopes the money can go towards an extension of the city’s tram network, improvements to its railway station and putting more buses on the street.Jon Collins, the council’s leader, said the toll on commuters was the price needed to pay for essential public transport in the city. “We need to do something if we want this city to thrive and grow,” he said. “Leadership is about saying, ‘There are difficult decisions to be made in the interests of this city’.”Nottingham, like many other British conurbations, has suffered partial gridlock during busy times of day and had considered a congestion charge to tackle the issue, which the council says costs businesses £160m a year.However, it decided this would take longer to implement, be more expensive for motorists and come with huge administration costs.Conservative council members have described the toll as “born out of desperation” and “about money and money only”. It would make people pay for the “audacity” of going to work, said Brendan Clarke-Smith, a Tory councillor.The Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Chamber of Commerce and Industry suggests that more than 90 per cent of employers in the city oppose the proposals.Many companies could leave the area as a result of the charge, the chamber has warned. Alliance Boots, the biggest private-sector emp­loyer in the city, is likely to pay more than £500,000 a year – although that could be passed on to staff.
310;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-05-06T19:38:50Z;Tabet takes sabbatical from Citi;;"Kamal Tabet, the London-based global head of financial entrepreneurs at Citigroup, and one of the best-connected bankers among private equity firms, is taking a sabbatical following a wider restructuring at the US bank.Mr Tabet, 47, will take his leave while Citi merges its financial entrepreneurs business with its infrastructure division to create an alternative asset group. His move comes at a time when banks are finding it hard to fund private equity deals.Mr Tabet, who joined Citigroup in 1994 from Lazard, has worked with some of the world’s biggest private equity firms, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone, Carlyle, Apax and CVC Capital Partners.Under his leadership, Citigroup managed to increase revenues from private equity between four and five times.Some of his highest-profile deals included advising Blackstone on its flotation last year; advising KKR on its £11bn ($22bn) buy-out of Alliance Boots – a record for Europe; advising R20, the investment vehicle owned by Robert Tchenguiz on the acquisition of his 10 per cent stake in J Sainsbury; helping Terra Firma raise its €5.4bn ($8.4bn) third fund; and advising on the €7.6bn buy-out of VNU, the Dutch business information group.Mr Tabet sits on Citigroup’s global investment banking operating committee. He is also on the advisory board of Bridges Ventures, the venture capital firm founded by Sir Ronald Cohen, which invests in deprived areas in the UK.Born in Lebanon, Mr Tabet moved to France when he was 15. After graduating from Wharton Business School in 1984, he joined Republic National Bank of New York as an options trader before joining Lazard two years later.In 1994, he moved to Citigroup, where, along with four other senior bankers, he launched the bank’s European sponsors group.Mr Tabet, who speaks fluent French and Arabic, may want to capitalise on his Middle-Eastern cultural heritage at a time when sovereign wealth funds are looking to spend the billions they have built up from oil reserves.However, he was also responsible for building Citigroup’s financial sponsor group, so Mr Tabet could also help these funds channel their liquidity in the region.Citigroup’s new alternative asset group will be led by Chad Leat as chairman and Brad Coleman as global head. It will encompass the financial entrepreneurs and infrastructure groups.The bank also announced in an internal memo that Mikael Dahl, co-head of the European financial entre­preneurs group, would be leaving Citigroup after 24 years.Several senior bankers covering private equity have switched sides in recent months, electing to work for their clients in-house. Others have moved to Asia and the Middle East in a bid to tap into new revenue streams.Citigroup took $3.1bn in writedowns, before taxes, on funded and unfunded highly leveraged finance commitments in the first quarter."
311;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-05-05T16:40:15Z;Banks plan crackdown on debt trend;;European banks plan to clamp down on the emerging trend for private equity firms to buy debt in the companies they own, mirroring similar restrictions in the US, according to lawyers.The credit squeeze has made it harder for private equity firms to raise the bank debt needed to fund their leveraged buy-outs of companies.So they are seeking to buy debt issued to fund earlier buy-out deals, which is trading at a discount, making it a more attractive investment.Banks worry this may create a situation where a private equity firm owns both equity and debt in a company. For example, KKR could buy debt in the Alliance Boots pharmacy chain, in which it already controls the equity.Lawyers for banks say this could allow private equity firms to frustrate lenders from imposing their rights over a company in a default or debt restructuring.“It depends on the documents in each transaction, but theoretically it is possible for a private equity sponsor to buy enough debt to gain a blocking minority in the debt,” said Andrew Barker, partner at Jones Day, a leading M&A law firm.Under most UK loan agreements, lenders need a two-thirds majority to enforce an accelerated default procedure. They often need unanimous approval for other decisions, such as changes in the pricing, seniority or security of loans.He said the US Loan Syndication and Trading Association recently published standardised wording on the transferability of loans that restricted private equity firms and the companies they own from buying back their own debt. Where the practice was allowed, he said US banks were imposing tight restrictions, such as a limit on the amount of debt that can be bought or a block on voting rights.“This is very much on people’s radar and law firms will inevitably look at documents they have to try to give banks the ability to control the process,” he saidTDC, the Danish telecommunications operator that was Europe’s biggest LBO when bought for €13bn by a private equity consortium in 2005, has unsettled its lenders by buying back €200m (£157m) of loans at a discount price of 90-95 cents in the euro.PAI, the French private equity group, recently purchased second-lien debt in the Lafarge roofing business it bought for €1.96bn in 2006.Top banks, such as Deutsche Bank and Citigroup, have launched auctions of large swathes of their leveraged loan portfolios at discounted prices to free their balance sheets. Private equity firms are prominent among the interested buyers.Scott Samuel, lawyer at King & Spalding, said restrictions on debt buy- backs would be hard to enforce. “You will always find ways to buy debt if that is what you want to do. But it will be an avenue open only to the top private equity sponsors with their armies of lawyers.”A senior private equity executive said the changes to loan agreements smacked of “paranoia by the banks”.
312;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-05-02T19:40:15Z;Banks fail to sell Alliance Boots debt;;Investment bank efforts to offload about £780m of debt in Alliance Boots, the private equity owned pharmacies chain, collapsed this week amid disagreement over the terms of the sale.A syndicate of banks that financed last year’s £11bn buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity group, was ready to sell part of the debt at about 91 per cent of its original value, insiders said.But the deal fell apart after some participating banks, including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, balked at the terms.The stalled sale highlights growing tensions between investment banks as they grapple with an overhang of private equity loans left on their balance sheets as a result of the credit crisis.It also underscores the diverging valuation techniques that the investment banks have used when pricing the debt.Bankers involved in the Alliance Boots talks said they were disappointed by the failure to agree a sale, although they were encouraged by the strong demand from hedge funds and other specialised credit investors.A revised proposal is expected to be put to banks in the syndicate as early as next week. One member of the syndicate said: “We have had a lot of interest from investors in buying our Alliance Boots debt. They are queuing up for it.”The debt in Alliance Boots, Europe’s biggest private equity buy-out, is being watched closely as a guide to the market for European leveraged loans.Although banks in the US have marked down or sold a large chunk of their private equity debt at a heavy discount, lenders in Europe have been slower to follow suit.Disagreement between the banks focused on a clause that would have required all eight lenders in the syndicate jointly to compensate buyers if any Alliance Boots debt was sold at a lower price in the future.The requirement, known as a “most favoured nation” clause, would have made it harder for the banks to sell their debt aggressively if the market deteriorated.RBS wrote down the value of its leveraged loan portfolio last month to an average of 88 per cent of its face value as the bank cleaned up its balance sheet as part of its £12bn rights issue.However, Barclays has so far taken much smaller writedowns, writing off fees of £130m and recognising a loss of just £58m on its £7.4bn portfolio. The bank is due to update investors on its balance sheet position in a trading statement scheduled for May 15.Syndication of the £9bn of Boots debt was abandoned last summer after the crisis in US subprime mortgage lending triggered a liquidity crisis in debt markets.The senior debt, which was split into five tranches, is held by Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Unicredit, Barclays, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, RBS and Morgan Stanley.
313;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-04-27T18:46:08Z;Baker in advanced talks to chair Virgin Active;;Richard Baker, former chief executive of Alliance Boots who quit the company after it fell into private equity hands last year, is preparing his own move into the private sector – for a short time at least – as chairman of Virgin Active, Sir Richard Branson’s gym chain.Mr Baker confirmed on Sunday he was in “advanced discussions” to take up the post as chairman of the gym group, raising speculation that Sir Richard is gearing up to float the business.Mr Baker said that a flotation was something the company had looked at against other options. However, he insisted his appointment was “not a precursor [to a float]. It is one of many op-tions. There is no timetable”.Last year, Sir Richard invited investment banks to submit proposals to float the business at the end of 2008. Banks were pushing for a £1bn-plus valuation of Virgin Active, which is 75 per cent owned by Sir Richard’s Virgin Group. Bridgepoint Capital and Permira, the private equity groups, left in from their sale of Holmes Place, own 15 per cent, with the management holding a 10 per cent cut.However, the credit markets have deteriorated significantly in the first quarter of 2008, and could force Virgin to put plans on hold in the short term.The chairmanship will be Mr Baker’s first big job since quitting Alliance Boots last July after its £11bn takeover by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US private equity firm.Virgin Active, the second-biggest gym chain in the UK, has more than 160 clubs across six countries, including South Africa, Italy and Spain.A flotation would suit Bridgepoint and Permira, which have little interest in remaining minority shareholders in an illiquid, privately-held company.However, a trade sale would allow them to exit. Virgin is thought to prefer a flotation as it sees opportunities for consolidation in the gym club business, much of which is in the hands of private equity in the UK.
314;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-04-23T22:51:06Z;D Bank loan sale lifts hopes of rally;;Deutsche Bank is preparing another multibillion-dollar sale of leveraged loans on its books, adding to the evidence of a rally in corporate credit markets.The growing demand for such credits is an encouraging sign because banks are trying to sell a backlog of about $100bn in leveraged loans they are still holding. Banks want to sell the loans – used to finance private equity buy-outs – to free up capital after suffering heavy losses in the subprime mortgage meltdown.The latest Deutsche deal, which would involve European loans, is expected to be announced with the bank’s earnings release next week and would mark the third big sale of leveraged loans by a bank this month.Citigroup led the way with a $12bn sale, and Deutsche followed by selling about $5bn of US leveraged loans. Other sales of leveraged loans by banks, insurers and finance companies are expected, market insiders say.“There is a technical floor in the market as demand and supply come into synch,” says Michael Zupon, head of US leveraged finance at Carlyle, the private equity group.“People are scrambling to get long.”The second Deutsche sale could be comparable in size to its $5bn sale of leveraged loans to Apollo Management and Blackstone. However, given the current demand for such credits, the sale could be expanded. The Deutsche loans being sold could include a piece of the $16bn financing for the buy-out of Alliance Boots, the UK pharmacy chain.Possible buyers include Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which has shown up at several loan auctions but has been more cautious than its competitors on price. KKR has also considered buying stakes in banks such as Washington Mutual and National City, but pulled out because of concerns about future credit losses, say people familiar with the matter. KKR declined to comment.In its first leveraged loan sale, Deutsche lent the buyers $3 to $4 – at below market rates – for every $1 of credits they bought. The buyers paid full prices for the loan themselves, one buyer says.By selling the loans at full prices, Deutsche was able to avoid marking down its positions. The deal offers Deutsche additional protection because if the price of the loans drops, the buyers would have to put up more collateral, the loan buyer says.For the private equity firms, the key to the deal is the low-cost leverage, which gives them a chance to boost potential profits even though they paid a full price for the loans themselves.Deutsche also has sold smaller loan exposures through dozens of trades. Many of the buyers have been hedge funds who expect the loan market will rally and are already complaining that private equity firms are using their clout with the banks to get loans in the bigger deals on more favourable terms.
315;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;How do share prices react to cash calls?;;"Even before Royal Bank of Scotland, Britain’s second-biggest bank, admitted it was considering a cash call to shore up its creaking balance sheet, strategists had been predicting the return of the rights issue.Graham Secker of Morgan Stanley said earlier this month that if de-equitisation had been the buzz word of the 2003-2007 bull market, then re-equitisation would be the catch phrase of the credit crisis.“With the cost of equity falling to its lowest level, relative to debt, since 2001, we expect a large increase in rights issuance,” he saidIn the pre-credit crunch era, when debt was cheap and plentiful, things were very different. The obvious thing for finance directors to do was borrow money to buy back their own stock. And they certainly did. At the height of the de-equitisation in 2006, the UK market shrank by 3.6 per cent.Private equity groups also took advantage of the seemingly limitless supply of debt to go on an acquisition spree that culminated in Europe’s largest ever buy-out, the £12bn purchase of Alliance Boots by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts last summer.Debt funding costs were 2.5 percentage points cheaper than equity between 2003 and 2006. That gap has shrunk to 1 percentage point because of the credit squeeze.As a result, Mr Secker believes companies will conserve cash by scaling down buybacks. They will also look to raise funds they need through the equity market, via rights issues or placings. This will be especially true for companies with weak balance sheets where the cost of borrowing cash is now prohibitively expensive.This point was graphically illustrated by Imperial Energy, a FTSE 250 oil exploration company focused on Russia. Its shares tanked earlier this month after the company said it had been frozen out of the debt markets and would fund its development programme through a £300m rights issue.Imperial’s experience raises a key question for investors – how do share prices react to cash calls?The good news for shareholders in RBS is that not every cash call is greeted with a 25 per cent share price fall, as seen for Imperial.Indeed, RBS shares closed up yesterday and UBS, the Swiss bank, has risen 25 per cent since announcing its $15bn rights issue at the turn of the month.Mr Secker says there is no rule of thumb that says investors should sell or buy shares in a company that announces a rights issue. However, a good strategy has been to buy into rights issues from distressed companies.According to his analysis, the best long-term performance comes from buying companies which announce rights issues that are:
1. raising a large amount of cash relative to their market capitalisation;
2. have performed poorly in the previous year;
3. are using the cash raised to repair/strengthen balance sheets.The wider point about re-equitisation, of course, is that it should have a negative effect on the market. If more equity is being issued than retired then, logically, share prices should fall.The chatter among traders in the City yesterday was that there could be £25bn of equity issuance from the banking sector this year, of which £10bn may come from RBS.By contrast, in the past six years, the three biggest completed rights issues in the UK raised £10.8bn.All of which raises the question of who will buy these new shares, given that pension funds and life companies have been reducing their equity weightings for years.Surprisingly, there is no sign of re-equitisation affecting the market yet. The FTSE 100 closed at 6,056.5 last night, just 10 per cent off the seven-year high reached last June. That seems incredible given that credit markets have suffered a calamitous correction.However, it reflects the fact that the blue-chip index, with its heavy weighting of oil and mining stocks, is increasingly a large punt on rising commodity prices."
316;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-04-12T04:21:59Z;Private equity takes dim view of disclosure;;Private equity’s initial response to Sir David Walker’s voluntary guidelines on transparency can be split into three: the dull, the slack and the angry.The glossy annual reviews emerging from several bigger buy-out firms, with Bridgepoint the first to publish, have met a mixture of applause and jeers.This stab at transparency has been sensitive and awkward for an industry with a traditional attitude of “private equity means private”.The first attempts at disclosure fall into three camps.The dull, such as Permira, which clashed with unions over its buy-out of the AA motor repair service, have embraced the guidelines and produced bland but informative reviews, in line with Sir David’s recommendations.The slack, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which last year completed a UK record £11bn ($22bn) buy-out of the Alliance Boots pharmacy chain, are yet to produce a response, but say they will do so soon in compliance with Walker guidelines.The angry – or more specifically Guy Hands’ Terra Firma, the owner of EMI – seized on the disclosure process as a chance to vent spleen about British tax changes, distracting attention from the rest of its annual review.In fairness to Mr Hands, Terra Firma’s report was more informative than most. But with other countries – led by Sweden and Denmark – preparing a version of the Walker guidelines for their own markets, the response of buy-out firms has left critics demanding more.Union leaders, at the forefront of the recent campaign against private equity, complain the Walker guidelines are too lax and the response little more than “blind man’s bluff” designed to “hoodwink” the public.Paul Maloney, senior AA organiser for the GMB union, which spearheaded the campaign against Permira at the AA, says: “I have looked at the Permira [annual review] that came out and all it is doing is blowing their own trumpet.”He complains there is no detail of the debt raised by the AA, which recently merged with Saga to create Acromas, a travel and insurance group, or of “contingency plans” to handle an economic slowdown that could hit jobs and profits. However, Acromas plans to publish details of the debt separately in a few months.The union criticism may confirm the worst fears of buy-out executives, who suspect they have stepped on to a “slippery slope”, leading inevitably to calls for disclosure on more sensitive subjects, such as deal profits and executive rewards.John McFall, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, which plans to resume an inquiry into private equity next month, says the industry still needs to win over doubters. “The question of whether this is financial engineering or real operating improvements that add value to the economy is yet to be answered,” he says.The buy-out industry’s supporters say it has addressed the main complaint of its critics: that an increasing part of the UK economy is in the hands of companies that are a mystery to stakeholders, staff, customers and suppliers.The reviews, such as one from Doughty Hanson, owner of the troubled 20:20 mobile phone distributor, include details about the private equity firm’s top executives, their type of investors, the companies they own, and their strategy. They also discuss the firm’s market outlook and social and environmental approach.Simon Walker, head of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, which commissioned the new guidelines, says: “I am pretty happy with what I have seen so far. Provided people meet the basics, I expect to see the same diversity that you see in public company reports.”“I think I knew far more about Terra Firma after reading their report than I did before,” says Mr Walker. “My attitude is let a hundred flowers bloom.”Terra Firma says it spent £250,000 on producing its 120-page review, including details of executive remuneration – the top 15 managers received £665,053 each on average and all staff invested €200m in its latest €5.4bn fund.It also included a balance sheet, showing Terra Firma had €5.5bn of investment assets, and a profit and loss statement, explaining that partnership expenses were €30.2m last year. None of these were required under the Walker guidelines.Other firms aim to go beyond the guidelines. Cinven, which last year bought Bupa’s UK hospitals business, intends to publish information on all portfolio companies, whether UK-based or not.Some big London-based buy-out houses own few companies in the UK, such as CVC Capital Partners and TPG Capital, which has a minority stake in Debenhams, the department store.These say they will update their websites – TPG’s is still a bit bare – which Sir David left as an alternative to an annual review.The Walker guidelines will probably make a bigger splash when annual reports are published soon by big private equity-owned companies, such as Alliance Boots, EMI and Acromas.
317;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-04-11T14:54:55Z;Payment terms: anger grows;;"Small business owners have attacked major British companies for using the credit crunch as an excuse to arbitrarily raise payment terms.Janet Kelly, managing director of media company Free Features, warned that entrepreneurs were suffering. “This is disastrous as yet again the big boys use the smaller businesses to fund their growth and profit – while the entrepreneurs go under,” she said.“Payment terms for us is always an issue, particularly when working with agents who then also have to get their payments from their clients. We have recently had to wait 90 days for a payment that we would
normally expect within 14 days.”Ms Kelly’s remarks were echoed by Rob Roscoe, managing director of London tradesmen The Handy Squad. He said: “We were called in by a large estate agent and taken to task about chasing debts too aggressively. Apparently taking a gentler attitude to money owed is now part of ‘developing a happy business relationship’. We are seeing signs of being squeezed.”Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are suffering as companies, including private equity-owned pharmacy and retail chain Alliance Boots, have moved recently to increase payment from invoice terms to as much as 75 days. But, while many firms have claimed this is a direct result of the credit crunch, according to the Forum for Private Business (FPB) – which lists a Hall of Shame of companies that have recently extended payment terms – Alliance Boots is just the latest in a long line to have implemented the changes.The FPB’s website lists many high street names, including House of Fraser, Debenhams and Robert Dyas that decided to increase their payment terms long before the credit crunch started.David Frost, director general of the British Chamber of Commerce, said major corporates should show more leniency in these economically difficult times.“At a time of economic turbulence, bigger businesses have a wider responsibility. There is no need for firms to delay payments and
make life uncomfortable for SMEs,” he said.Miles Templeman, the director-general of the Institute of Directors, agreed and called for the culprits to be named and shamed.“Many of these companies are not even using the smokescreen of the credit crunch,” he said. “They are harming the smaller end of our economy and, while it is not something that can be regulated against, we should try and instigate a certain amount of peer group pressure.Alliance Boots cited improved purchasing power following its merger with Alliance UniChem as the main reason for the increase.“Our procurement strategies are in line with other groups of similar size and scale,” the firm said in a statement."
318;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-04-02T19:16:40Z;Shed the boiler plate and let audit kitemarks take off;;Like a skull on the desk of a medieval scholar, a copy of Enron’s 2000 annual report – its last – sits on Lombard’s desk.From the opening letter from Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling – “Enron [is] the right company with the right model at the right time” – to the page of company values (Communication, Respect, Integrity, Excellence), there are plenty of moments to make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. The audit report by the late Arthur Andersen LLP is not one of them.The opinion is short and unremarkable. Would Andersen have survived had the report been a lengthy piece of boilerplate, stuffed with caveats and get-out clauses? Almost certainly not. Enron was a fraud. Andersen, while guilty of forming too close a relationship with its client in non-audit business, was brought down by a charge of obstruction of justice, not of lax auditing.But adopting a “kitemark” approach – as proposed now by KPMG’s John Griffith-Jones – might have made Andersen think twice before cosying up to Enron as it did. Instead of lengthy legalese, the co-chairman of KPMG Europe suggests a one-line endorsement that the accounts are, in the opinion of the firm, “about right”. The possibility of undetected fraud is the only escape clause.This is brave. It reminds the user that a “clean” audit report is an opinion, not a scientific fact. Too many shareholders misunderstand that fundamental point. Assuming the technology for eliminating material error in audits advances in the coming years, a kitemark approach might allow firms to concentrate on identifying fraud, which Mr Griffith-Jones calls “the weak link in the chain” of auditing.Like all principles-based approaches, whether in regulation or accounting, the kitemark risks falling to earth at the first gust of legal challenge if lawyers reach for the rulebook. But rather than making auditors think they can somehow dodge the blame by loading additional clauses on to their report, it should force them to shoulder more responsibility.Why mother knows bestIt is hard to imagine being taken to task by Indra Nooyi. Speaking yesterday in London, the chief executive of PepsiCo came across as a boss who is firm, fair, and full of wit and wisdom about modern office life.For example, when Ms Nooyi’s teenage daughter calls pleading for more time on her Nintendo, the PepsiCo boss’s assistants run through a Nooyi-approved checklist (“Have you done your homework?” and so on) before authorising the request and sending Ms Nooyi a note of what was agreed. She calls it “group mothering”.So far, so fluffy. But it would be dangerous to underestimate the steel at the heart of her approach. She e-mails colleagues through the night, expects “24/7” commitment from people working on deals for her (men or women) and acknowledges that when you choose to enter the “C-suite” of chief executives and chief financial officers, notions of flexibility and work-life balance tend to evaporate.That’s no reason to accept the macho status quo, however. In addressing a question at the Women of the Future conference about why she chose the US, not the UK, in which to pursue her career 30 years ago, she went straight to the heart of a problem with corporate Britain.If she had chosen the UK, she said, she would not now be running a multinational company: “I look around at [British] society – I don’t see too many people like me in CEO positions. I don’t see people like me having broken through in major C-suite jobs.”The message is clear: Britain is lagging behind America on diversity. As Ms Nooyi suggests, it will take much more “tireless lobbying” before a tipping point is reached and the number of women running Britain’s biggest 100 companies reaches even a small handful. However softly put, that is a hard message, but one that UK companies must heed.The wonder of WooliefieldIt sounds like the high street’s ultimate two-for-one offer: drop into Somerfield for six pork pies, emerge with a value pack of Woolworths T-shirts, or vice versa. The unworthy first reaction to the retailers’ reciprocal store-within-a-store pilot project was that two drowning men were clinging to each other for support. There is a warped logic to the idea. Each group is lumbered with hundreds of branches, in varying sizes, so why not see if product exchange leads to an overall increase in footfall?It’s been done before, of course. Last year, WH Smith agreed to open Post Offices in some stores and Boots to sell Prudential’s health insurance. Older shoppers may remember a similar idea: small outlets in close proximity peddling their wares to people as they pass by. That pilot project lasted millennia before it was blown away by the arrival of Woolworths, WH Smith, Boots, and their ilk. It was called a market.
319;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-03-28T17:00:34Z;Business credit squeeze anger;;"Small business groups have criticised Alliance Boots for imposing new terms under which it will pay suppliers up to 105 days after billing and charge them a 2.5 per cent “settlement fee”. The move is seen as symptomatic of a credit environment in which payment periods are lengthening as the economy slows – although the pharmacist said the changes had been in train since 2006.The Forum of Private Business, which represents 25,000 small businesses with 600,000 staff, said it was “naming and shaming” Alliance Boots “for squeezing its smaller suppliers”. FPB chief executive Phil Orford, said: “The practice of large retailers abusing their buying power continues to have a very negative impact on smaller businesses.”The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), whose 210,000 members include many self-employed people, said: “We disapprove of this [policy of Alliance Boots]. Small businesses should be paid in a reasonable timescale because they operate on such tight margins.”However, Alliance Boots said it was only standardising payment terms within its businesses and bringing them into line with industry norms. It said: “We are certain our procurement standards are in line with those of other groups of similar size and scale. We have always worked collaboratively with suppliers and will continue to do so.”The change in credit terms was signalled to business organisations when members received letters from finance staff at Alliance. These told suppliers that the new terms would “provide for payment 75 days from the end of the month of invoice”. This means an invoice submitted at the start of a month would not be paid for more than 100 days. Alliance Boots described a 2.5 per cent reduction in the prices paid by Alliance Boots as “a settlement discount”.Big businesses have featured in a series of surveys as the slowest payers. The result is that small businesses, in effect, provide large customers with valuable interest-free loans. The government has attempted to tackle the problem by
creating legal powers for companies to charge interest to late payers. However small suppliers are unwilling to do this because it would jeopardise repeat orders.According to the FSB, some large businesses have responded to a requirement to report the average time it took them to pay bills to Companies House by setting up separate “payments subsidiaries”. This can allow a big business to keep a poor payment record out of sight, making it less likely that suppliers will reject it as a customer.A report from the Bankers Automated Clearing Services in January found the value of payments made later than the agreed period rose to £2.6bn in 2007. This took the total late payment burden shouldered by smaller businesses to £18.6bn last year."
320;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-03-18T23:58:35Z;Perspectives: It’s much too early to write off the role of the CIO;;"Last year, Boots, the UK high street chemist, and the retailer House of Fraser did away with the position of chief information officer, a move which heightened speculation that this animal, only recently evolved from less exalted creatures, was on the way to becoming an endangered species.The apparent logic behind their decision was that the company’s computer systems could be managed perfectly satisfactorily by a data processing specialist. The job of aligning IT strategy with the objectives of the business would fall to the chief financial officer.This, of course, mirrors the pattern seen in the early days of corporate computing, when processing was often limited to financial records and transactions – very much the preserve of the CFO – and technologists in white coats were simply required to keep the machines running.Abandoning the CIO requires, of course, that the CFO is IT literate and has a clear vision of how IT fits into the company’s overall strategy – a vision he or she can communicate to the board in comprehensible terms.The business academic Michael Earl locates the emergence of the CIO at a point in the late 1980s when data processing was transformed into information technology.More than a decade ago he wrote: “As the size of the IT budget increased, it became difficult to resist the notion that a corporate officer should be appointed to ensure that the information resources were efficiently and effectively deployed.”Even then there were doubts about the status of the position of CIO, with humourists suggesting the acronym stood for “Career is Over”. To some extent, the problem has been that information resources are proving mightily resistant to being deployed “efficiently and effectively”.Indeed, to look at many of the public issues that now constrain the growth and reputation of the IT department, you could be forgiven for thinking that much of senior IT management – the CIO, the IT director, the data processing manager – is incompetent.Now that, of course, is a nonsense. While there are duffers in every profession, most CIOs are highly capable, conscientious and skilled.Yet the criticisms persist, among them the fact that many IT departments take inadequate measures to protect their data. There is insufficient back-up and disaster recovery. Staff are allowed access to systems when carrying devices such as USB drives that would permit them to make off with vast swathes of data in their pocket.Proper security procedures for staff who leave the organisation are also not followed, opening up the threat of blackmail or worse. Regulatory measures are flouted. Data storage is inadequate and retrieval of information for legal or other purposes slow or impossible.Most damning, data centres are not managed in the conventional sense of the word.A recent survey suggested many CIOs have no inventory of the equipment on their premises. They may have too many or too few software licences. Some parts of the business may be running pirated software without their knowledge.And they will almost certainly have too many servers, most of them under-utilised, a consequence of the practice of adding a server each time an application is installed.Technologies are available to solve most of these problems, but no wonder many experts regard data centres as poorly managed and out of control. There are a complex set of reasons for this situation: the fact that the data processing department is often a “firm within a firm”; pressures to take on increasing workloads; new and complex systems; and budgets that can see-saw wildly (we are in a descending period at present).Surely, then, CIOs should be working towards creating an ideal IT set-up? Anita Chandraker of PA Consulting counsels against such a strategy. “Faced with complex IT landscapes and business needs, one of the most common pitfalls is to assume there is such a thing as an ideal IT set-up,” she says.“Today’s ‘ideal’ set-up will probably be redundant in a few years. The pace of technology and business change means the days of designing and delivering a suite of ideal applications, infrastructure and services are long gone,” she explains.Data processing, in fact, had only just established itself as a “proper” industry with ways of working and codes of practice when it was flung into upheaval by the microprocessor-led IT revolution and it has yet to come to terms with this new situation.It seems to me there is a gap between the leading edge of technology and ordinary data processing practice every bit as real as the digital divide between developed and developing nations. For the foreseeable future, it will not narrow.So Ms Chandraker is right: forget attempts to forge an “ideal” set-up and concentrate on finding ways to use technology to expedite business change appropriate to today’s trading environment.It’s a formula that should keep CIOs in business for years to come."

322;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Tesco looks for Japan expansion;;Tesco is sending Michael Fleming, its business development director, to Japan as the country’s chief executive, suggesting it is looking to expand more aggressively in the world’s second-biggest economy.The move comes a year after Tesco began rolling out Express-type stores in Japan, suggesting that the retailer has finally got the format right after four years of trying.Tesco, which announced plans to open Tesco Express-style stores in Japan a year ago, has rolled out at least 30 outlets over the past year, taking it to an estimated 150 stores.The British chain entered the Japanese market in 2004 through the acquisition of C Two-Network, which operates the Tsurukame chain of discount supermarkets.However, the venture was dogged by early setbacks: Scott Wheway quit as chief executive of the Japanese venture in 2004 to join Alliance Boots, while his successor, Ken MacMeikan, never even made it to Japan, quitting Tesco in favour of J. Sainsbury before taking up his Tokyo-based post.Japan delivered the poorest returns on investment of Tesco’s overseas markets in the financial year to February 2007. Cash return on investment was about 7 per cent, against returns of 15 per cent or higher in Thailand and South Korea. Japan was delivering returns of about 10 per cent in 2005-06.“Tesco really struggled to get the right people in place,” said one analyst. “They were forced to extend their feasibility study there, but now it seems that they are really committing to the business.”Tesco opened its first own-branded store in Tokyo just less than a year ago and now has an estimated 50 Tesco Express stores in the country.Japan has proved a difficult market for some of the biggest chains. Carrefour, which decided to enter Japan in 2000 – putting Russian plans on hold – withdrew from the market five years later. Wal-Mart is also struggling in Japan. Seiyu, its Japanese business, has been unprofitable since Wal-Mart first invested in 2002.Mr Fleming’s move is part of wider management changes.These also see Jeff Adams, the American-born chief executive of Tesco’s business in Thailand, move to Fresh & Easy in the US to become second-in-command to Tim Mason, chief executive of that venture.
323;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-03-11T20:15:01Z;Why Montague urgently needs to cultivate Friends;;"Sir Adrian Montague faces the unpleasant task of cutting 600 jobs at Friends Provident. Jim Smart’s was probably not supposed to be one of them.The news that the group’s finance director is planning to leave in August is not helpful for Sir Adrian. He became emergency executive chairman last year after the failure of a planned merger with Resolution led to the departure of Philip Moore, chief executive.Mr Smart, formerly finance director at Alliance Boots, was the name beside Sir Adrian’s on Friends’ strategic review. He will stay on until after Trevor Matthews arrives from Standard Life at the end of July to become chief executive. To avoid potential bidders such as JC Flowers, the private equity firm, treating the insurer like a company in surgery, with a caretaker chief executive and a lame-duck finance director, Sir Adrian needs friends urgently. Three in particular.First, he needs shareholders. The chairman must ensure they will not cave in too soon. Flowers’ indicative approach was said to be at 175p. The shares have now drifted to below 125p – a discount to the embedded value of 160p a share. Friends’ strategic review received short shrift on the day it was announced but the company claims yesterday’s full-year results show that businesses that will remain in the group are performing well. As long as investors back that vision, Sir Adrian will win time and (a little) negotiating clout.Second, he needs Gerry Grimstone, chairman of Standard Life. Mr Matthews is working out a six-month notice period at the rival insurer. If Sir Adrian could prevail on his counterpart to release the Australian executive early, that would boost confidence and reduce uncertainty.Third, he may need the Takeover Panel. Sir Adrian yesterday called on Flowers to clarify its intentions but he is reluctant to ask the Panel to call the firm’s bluff.Friends’ chairman is already courting investors assiduously. He must now draft two polite letters: one for immediate dispatch, to Mr Grimstone, asking him to let up; another held in reserve, to the Panel, asking for Flowers to put up.Cadbury stays airborneCadbury Schweppes has proved adept at navigating between the rock that is Nelson Peltz and the hard place of tight credit markets. A year ago this week, the US activist revealed a 3 per cent stake in the group. Since then, Cadbury’s shares have outperformed the FTSE 100 as the company has inched closer to splitting its confectionery and drinks arms.It is a close-run thing, though. Tuesday’s announcement that five lenders have agreed, conditionally, to be present at the birth of Dr Pepper Snapple (DPSG) came in the wake of suggestions that the demerger plan might be jeopardised by worsening conditions in the credit markets. In theory, a meltdown could still force the company to shelve the transaction. But the 1.6 per cent fall in the shares last Friday, when the rumour did the rounds, is an indication of what might happen if it did.The credit squeeze has already obliged Cadbury Schweppes to jettison plans to sell the drinks business and to pay out a special dividend to shareholders. Yesterday it made clear that DPSG would not be rewarding its shareholders with a dividend initially, as it starts its independent existence loaded with $3.8bn of net debt – 3.1 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Todd Stitzer, Cadbury Schweppes’ chief executive, may at times have looked like a balloonist ditching his prized possessions in an attempt to keep his basket above the waves. But while other corporate transactions have sunk without trace, he and his team have managed to keep the fundamental elements of the deal first outlined last year aloft.Given the turbulence in financial markets over the past 12 months, that is no mean feat."
324;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-03-11T19:27:17Z;Legal services: Law firms have solid local roots and global ambitions;;One thing no business in Leeds or West Yorkshire need go without is legal advice. Leeds is the second largest legal centre in the UK, with five of the UK’s 20 largest firms and 150 in total employing more than 8,000 legal professionals.Equally important, many of the big national firms have roots in Leeds and Yorkshire, having emerged from regional partnerships whose mergers have taken them on to the national stage and beyond.But the city’s law firms have greater ambitions, and have created Leeds Legal, a promotional body to market their services around the world.“London is known globally for its legal community and that attracts high-quality work,” says Neil McLean, managing partner in the Leeds office of DLA Piper. “We felt that if we could badge the Leeds legal community, we could attract similar work to the city.”DLA Piper is one of the big UK firms that can trace its origins to Leeds, where it has been since 1780 under one name or another. Other large firms with local roots include Addleshaw Goddard (1775), Pinsent Masons (there since the 1850s) and Eversheds (1907). Hammonds, which went international from its Leeds base 18 years ago, originated with a firm created in 1887 in neighbouring Bradford.The strength of the local economy is one reason for the success of the Leeds legal community, which has developed specialisms that reflect the needs of organisations based in Yorkshire.Addleshaw Goddard, for example, serves many financial services organisations, having advised Yorkshire Bank since the mid-19th century. DLA’s relationship with the Leeds-based Burton fashion chain (now part of Arcadia) led to it developing a roster of retail clients that includes Boots, Mothercare and Stylo.But all the larger firms have wider ambitions, and serve clients from further afield. Eversheds, for example, advises Bupa – based in London – from Leeds, as well US clients such as Dupont, the chemical group, and manufacturing conglomerate Tyco. Addleshaws acted for the Football League in its media rights deal for the three years from 2009-10 with Sky and the BBC. The Hammonds construction team has been involved in work around the 2012 London Olympic Games, while the firm’s Latin American desk advises Viña Undurraga, one of Chile’s largest and oldest wine producers, on its European expansion plans.“Lawyers operating out of Leeds may be working anywhere in the UK or globally,” says Nigel McClea, head of Pinsent’s Leeds office and a leading light in Leeds Legal.The buoyancy of the Yorkshire corporate scene has also provided Leeds firms with lucrative advisory work for acquisitions and buy-outs. Last year’s £783m ($1.6bn) management buy-out of Keepmoat, a Doncaster-based construction group and community regeneration company, was financed by Bank of Scotland but used advisers entirely from the Yorkshire region – including Eversheds, Hammonds and DLA’s Sheffield office.Keith Froud, corporate partner at Eversheds, says his firm’s role in the £250m purchase of APV, an Invensys subsidiary, by SPX of the US showed the strength of the Leeds office. “It involved 52 jurisdictions, but we were able to do it all from Leeds.”Despite all this activity, there is no difficulty in recruiting qualified staff in the city, says Paul Lee, senior partner of Addleshaw Goddard. “Yorkshire is a very attractive place to live. A lot of people might go south to university and then join a London firm. But after a period of time, they want to come back.”“Lawyers still want to do high-quality work when they leave London, and they can find it here,” says Pinsent’s Mr McClea.There is also home-grown talent from the two local universities, which have more than 1,800 students at undergraduate and post-graduate levels in their law schools.“The local universities are very important to us,” says Mr Froud of Eversheds. “Leeds is a fantastic place to live – and a lot of graduates want to stay in the area after they finish their studies.”Lower salaries in the region allow legal firms to charge lower rates than London offices, of course. But the large firms say that their Leeds offices are not just back offices for their London operations.According to Addleshaw’s Mr Lee, the firm handles business for its top 20 clients at all of its three offices – London and Manchester, in addition to Leeds. “We do the work where we have the best people,” he says.Further international recognition of Leeds as a legal centre is a priority for Leeds Legal. In November, it led a 10-strong delegation of lawyers and business leaders to Hong Kong and China to strengthen connections with their counterparts in the region.After meetings with some of Asia’s top law firms in Hong Kong, the delegation travelled to Hangzhou in China, Leeds’s twin city, where they met economic development ministers to discuss regeneration and public private finance initiatives.“At present, we take legal services to countries such as India and China and feed the work back to the city,” says Pinsent’s Mr McClea. “We want work to flow into Leeds because people in other countries recognise it as a global legal centre.”
325;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-02-22T01:39:11Z;Whitehall revolving door under scrutiny;;"Former ministers and civil servants who breach the rules when they take jobs in the private sector should face criminal action, a senior Whitehall figure said on Thursday.Appearing in front of the Commons public administration committee as part of its inquiry into the role of lobbyists – the first such investigation for 15 years – Lord MacLennan said there was a convincing argument for following the US system, where there were clearly defined legal requirements covering such moves.If breaches were reported by whistleblowers “then the normal forces of the criminal justice system come into play”, said Lord MacLennan, who belongs to the independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. “That is an option and I hope it is one which will be considered.”Such a change would mark a revolution in the current system, under which the advisory committee’s advice is based on fluid definitions of lobbying and has no enforcement powers.About 800 moves from the public sector to the private sector are passed to the committee every year and of these 50 or so are examined by its members. But it emerged that only one minister and two civil servants had ever been urged not to take a particular job in the private sector.The trend for former “crown servants” moving on to often lucrative posts in business is perhaps best exemplified by Tony Blair, the former prime minister, who has won lucrative contracts with JPMorgan and Zurich Financial Services since leaving office.The many former ministers now in the private sector include Patricia Hewitt, former health secretary, who is paid by Alliance Boots and Cinven; Denis MacShane, former Europe minister, now working for United Utilities; and Alan Milburn, who is on the board of PepsiCo.Many former civil servants and special advisers have also been vetted by the advisory committee.They include Air Chief Marshal Sir Anthony Bagnall, now an adviser at EDS; Sir Richard Dearlove, former chief of the intelligence service, who is on AIG’s board; and Sir David Omand, former security co-ordinator at the Cabinet Office, who is now adviser to the Society of British Aerospace Companies.Among the most controversial of recent years was Sir Robert Walmsley, former chief of defence procurement, who, a year after retiring in 2003, took a job with General Dynamics, a US defence company that had won £2bn in orders from the Ministry of Defence.Paul Flynn, the Labour MP, said it was wrong that so many people were using public posts “as a springboard, as an apprenticeship, for earning great riches”.MPs on Thursday questioned the process by which the advisory committee – described by Mr Flynn as “an all-male collection of the great and the good” – offered its advice and whether it was too lenient.Former crown servants are almost always given approval for their new posts but are sometimes advised to wait for a period of months before starting. They may be advised not to lobby the government for a certain period, usually 12 months.In the case of Air Chief Marshal Sir John Day, who had been asked to wait a year before becoming an adviser to BAE Systems, the period was cut to three months after an intervention by Mr Blair."
326;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-02-14T02:12:57Z;Private equity creating jobs, says BVCA;;Businesses backed by private equity have been creating jobs at a much faster rate than other private sector companies, according to a report published on Wednesday by the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (BVCA).In the five years to April 2007, UK private equity-backed companies increased their worldwide staff by an average of 8 per cent a year, compared with 0.4 per cent for FTSE 100 companies and 3 per cent for the FTSE 250.They have increased investment and research and development spending faster than the national average. Their sales and exports have also grown faster over the five years.The report is the latest response by the association to last year’s public backlash against the industry, which led to calls for higher taxation and heavier regulation. Private equity firms were accused of asset-stripping, job-cutting and tax-dodging following take-over bids for some of the best known companies such as Alliance Boots and J Sainsbury.“Private equity contributes more R&D, more investment, more jobs, more sales and more exports,” said Simon Walker, BVCA chief executive. “This report is an antidote to some of the myths about private equity.”The average private-equity backed company employed just over 500 staff in the UK, the report said, and has sales revenue of £47m ($92m). The majority are medium-sized and fast-growing.They have increased their sales 8 per cent a year on average in the five years to 2007, compared with 6 per cent for FTSE 100 companies and 5 per cent for the FTSE 250. Their exports rose 10 per cent annually over the five years, at a time when exports nationally increased 4 per cent a year.British private equity firms have invested more than £70bn in about 25,000 UK businesses since 1984. The UK industry accounted for 57 per cent of total European private equity investment in 2006.The firms employ more than 9,000 people, and generated fees of more than £5bn for professional advisers in 2006. The companies they invest in employ 1.1m people, while the number employed by all the companies they have ever invested in total about 3m people.Investment in UK private-equity backed companies was up 11 per cent a year and R&D spending rose 14 per cent. The increases for the UK as a whole were 3 per cent and 1 per cent respectively.Private equity is also a big contributor to the exchequer. The report said companies backed by private equity contributed £35bn in taxes during the last tax year. Mr Walker said UK pension funds had been slow to invest in private equity.
327;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-02-12T23:17:40Z;Big European buy-outs tumble;;The headline-grabbing €1bn-plus deals that typified the golden era of European private equity suffered a surprise fall last year as contracting credit markets took their toll in the second half, according to research published on Wednesday.Early last year mega buy-outs seemed to be propelling big private equity firms to new heights, culminating with the record £11bn ($21.6bn) takeover of the Alliance Boots pharmacy chain and triggering a fierce political backlash, notably in the UK.But a dramatic tightening of debt markets slammed the breaks on €1bn-plus deals after the summer and, over the whole year, they fell 14 per cent by value, according to Incisive Media and Bridgepoint, the UK buy-out firm.In contrast, the smaller, mid-market end of private equity seemed less affected by the credit squeeze as deals worth €250m-€1bn grew more than 38 per cent.Smaller deals have proved more immune to the credit squeeze as they are less dependent on banks’ ability to syndicate large amounts of debt to third-party investors, which evaporated after the US subprime mortgage crisis. Mid-market deals also typically use less leverage and can still be financed by a club of banks holding the debt on their balance sheets rather than trying to sell it to collateralised debt obligations and other investors.Several mid-market deals were signed after the credit squeeze, such as the €745m purchase of GET, a Norwegian cable operator, the €540m buy-out of Coor Service Management, a Swedish outsourcing group, and the €730m acquisition of Global Garden Products, an Italian lawnmower maker.The overall value of European buy-outs was steady at €175.3bn last year, almost unchanged from €174bn in 2006. Deals worth €1bn or more accounted for 50 per cent of all buy-outs by value, down from 59 per cent the previous year.Kevin Reynolds, a Bridgepoint partner, predicted 2007 would be “a high water mark for at least a couple of years”. He said: “I think it will be fundamentally different this year. Any suggestion that things are getting better since the credit crunch is just not true. If anything, they are getting worse.”The UK reinforced its position as Europe’s biggest private equity market, accounting for 40 per cent of all the continent’s buy-outs against only 23 per cent in 2006.Germany overtook France for the first time as Europe’s second biggest private equity market. German buy-outs – such as the €850m takeover of Deutsche Telekom’s media broadcast unit and the €1bn buy-out of Bavaria Yachtbau, a yacht maker – rose 14 per cent to €29.1bn while France fell 38 per cent to €21.4bn.European private equity buyers shifted their aim from cyclical areas such as media and technology to the services, industrial and financial sectors. The value of financial services buy-outs more than doubled to €10.9bn. But media buy-outs fell 57 per cent to €11.5bn and technology buy-outs dropped 70 per cent to €8bn.
328;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Depth of equity pools becomes more clear;;"One of the biggest drivers behind the recent bull market for equities is quickly losing its influence.Between 2003 and the first half of last year, share prices were boosted by the fact that the amount of equity in circulation was shrinking in all parts of the world, apart from Asia. This was due to the record number of cash takeovers and leveraged buy-outs and billions of dollars worth of share buy-backs. But, since the credit crisis erupted last August, the process – known as “de-equitisation” – has slowed dramatically.Robert Buckland, chief global strategist at Citigroup and the man who coined the term de-equitisation, says the onset of the credit squeeze and a decline in M&A had altered the trend.“Credit markets conditions have changed substantially and we are not likely to see the aggressive levels of de-equitisation we saw in 2006 and the first half of last year,” he says. “De-equitisation has been severely challenged by the credit crunch. The practice will become less aggressive and will change in nature, although it will not disappear completely.”Until recently, the pool of global equity had tended to deepen over time as stock from new issues exceeded the amount being taken out of circulation through M&A and buy-backs.However, the trend began to reverse in the early part of the decade and gained momentum in the following years as a surge in private equity-backed LBOs, debt-funded and cash takeovers removed a host of quoted companies from the stock market. Some of the biggest deals included the $39bn buy-out of Equity Office Properties, the $45bn acquisition of TXU and the £11bn ($21.9bn) deal for Alliance Boots.At the same time, companies rewarded shareholders through these good times by buying back billions of dollars of their own shares.The upshot was that, in 2006 for example, the European stock market shrank by €65bn ($96bn), or 1.3 per cent of its total market capitalisation, while the US market shrank 2.1 per cent and the UK market by 3.6 per cent.However, the European equity market shrank by only 0.2 per cent last year and although the figure for the US was higher year-on-year, this was largely due to a series of huge M&A deals completed in the early part of the year.Since the onset of the credit crunch, the M&A bandwagon has well and truly come off the rails; 2008 has been the slowest start to a year for deals since 2002, according to data from Dealogic. Not only that, but M&A activity going forward is less likely to be funded by debt.Stuart McKee, a partner in the corporate finance practice at PwC in London, says companies will rely on a much greater proportion of equity financing.With the market “all but closed to very large LBO deals . . . the levels of debt used prior to the credit crunch would be much more difficult to achieve,” Mr McKee adds.In addition, share buy-back programmes are likely to be heavily curtailed in the capital-constrained banking sector, even if turmoil in the financial markets will not prevent other companies from announcing hefty share buy-backs.For example, Siemens, Europe’s largest engineering group, recently announced plans to buy back 11.5 per cent of its own shares in the biggest share buy-back programme in the history of corporate Germany.Barnaby Martin, credit strategist at Merrill Lynch, says that in an environment where companies are more likely to miss earnings, management is likely to respond with greater amounts of share buy-backs and higher dividends in an effort to keep shareholders happy.He said the “easiest thing a company can do is to issue some debt and buy back some shares”.With few signs that M&A will return to the levels seen over the last few years, there seems little chance that the more aggressive levels of de-equitisation will return again any time soon. Mr Buckland insisted M&A would not disappear but said “the way it is financed will change”.Mr Martin said the buy-out pipeline was “not dead, just sleeping” and predicted it would regain momentum in 2009.“It may take a while, but ultimately the private equity threat will return next year, albeit in a less aggressive and less leveraged form,” he said."
329;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-01-29T10:01:35Z;The Sanctuary sold to PZ Cussons;;The Sanctuary, one of the country’s best known spas, has been sold by its private equity owner HG Capital for £75m to PZ Cussons, the consumer products group.The Sanctuary, which is headed by former Marks and Spencer marketing director Alice Avis, also sells a range of branded beauty products, which account for 70 per cent of group revenues.The sale, which will realise £22.4m for the private equity group, comes on the back of a successful Christmas during which Sanctuary bucked the weaker sales trend at many retail and consumer focused groups. For the three months to December 31 retail sales grew by 11 per cent. The performance was even more dramatic in the US where sales over Christmas soared by 80 per cent.The disposal marks a quick turnround of the business, which has expanded rapidly since 2005 when HG paid £23m and bought the personal care products line under license from its private owners. The deal will add 48p per share to HG’s net asset value of 920p as of the end of November.Since buying the business the private equity group has signed an exclusive agreement with Boots and expanded aggressively in the UK. It has also sought to expand the brand overseas, primarily in the US through an agreement with retailer Target.This is the latest deal by HG, which has €2.5bn of funds under management, and invests in the consumer, healthcare, industrial and technology sectors. Last month it acquired Casa Reha, a leading nursing home provider in Germany, for an undisclosed sum and in November raised €115m for Addison Software, the German tax accounting group.The acquisition of Sanctuary by PZ Cussons will allow the emerging markets-focus group to expand into the UK market where it already has a presence through the Imperial Leather and Carex range of products.The company also plans to expand the Sanctuary range of personal care products outside the UK.“The Sanctuary business represents an excellent strategic opportunity for PZ Cussons, giving us a greater presence in the premium segment of the UK’s personal care market through an established and well respected brand,” said Alex Kanellis, chief executive.In results published alongside the Sanctuary acquisition, PZ Cussons said it had seen good trading in three key markets of Africa, Asia and Europe in the six months to the end of November.Pre-tax profits before exceptional items rose 8 per cent to £32.5m on revenues of £299.5m, up from 279.8m the previous year. Basic earnings per share rose to 5.33p and will be used to pay an interim dividend of 1.075p.PZ Cussons shares rose 4¼p or 2.2 per cent in morning trading to 197p.
330;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-01-22T01:28:46Z;Income from private equity put at £5.4bn;;Private equity generated £5.4bn ($10.5bn) of income for the UK financial and professional services sector last year, accounting for 12 per cent of Britain’s financial services revenues, according to a report published on Monday.“This report shows just how important the private equity industry is to the UK economy and the financial services industry,” said Simon Walker, chief executive of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (BVCA). Private equity’s contribution has increased from £3bn the previous year.The report from the BVCA is part of an effort to fight back by the UK buy-out industry, which faces a growing burden of taxation and regulation after a public backlash against it last year.The report, unveiled on Monday night at the London Stock Exchange, showed that private equity employed more than 18,000 people either directly or indirectly. That is a big jump from the BVCA’s previous figure of 10,000 direct and indirect jobs.Buy-out firms came under fire last year after bidding for some of the UK’s best-known companies, such as Alliance Boots and J Sainsbury, leading to cries of asset-stripping, tax-dodging and job-cutting. The government reacted by increasing the base rate of capital gains tax from 10 per cent to 18 per cent, saying it would make private equity pay a fairer share of tax.In response the industry commissioned Sir David Walker, the City grandee, to draw up voluntary guidelines on transparency and disclosure, to head off the threat of regulation.The BVCA boss argues that the 18,000 jobs generated by private equity in the UK are the types of skilled roles that the government is trying to encourage in response to the transfer of many unskilled jobs to emerging markets, such as India and China.London was ranked as the second-biggest city in terms of the number of people directly employed by private equity, with 7,100, behind New York, with 13,200, and ahead of San Francisco, with 4,500, according to a report published last week by Private Equity Intelligence.The report said the other cities in the top 10 of private equity were Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Paris, Stockholm and Tokyo.In 2006, the UK made up 66.8 per cent of European private equity by new funds raised and about a third of activity by funds invested.However, other European markets, such as France and Germany, are closing the gap and the BVCA is warning the government it risks driving some buy-out firms overseas if it presses ahead with plans to raise taxes on the sector.A survey from the BVCA last week showed that negative feeling in the industry about the UK was at an all-time high, with almost 30 per cent of private equity firms saying the country was an unattractive place to do business, up from 7 per cent in September.
331;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-01-18T00:24:10Z;Boots encouraged by UK retail;;Alliance Boots, the health and beauty group bought last year by KKR for £11.1bn, has emerged as one of the Christmas winners as the UK retail division led strong sales growth.Like-for-like sales in the three months to December 31 are understood to have risen by 4.8 per cent in the retail division and 6.9 per cent, excluding dispensary, in the UK stores.The core cosmetics and perfume lines – including Boots’ own No7 range – are believed to have performed particularly well.Volumes in the dispensary business rose 5.2 per cent but at a lower value as the government increased the “clawback” of profits from pharmacies dispensing NHS drugs. The wholesale division saw like-for-like sales growth of 3.4 per cent. The group’s gross margin also increased, driving increased operating profit.The trading performance may give some comfort to banks that provided debt for the KKR buy-out. This turned out to be the high watermark for buy-out activity before the credit squeeze and the subsequent plunge in the valuations of retail stocks.Most of the debt for the transaction is still on the banks’ books as the credit squeeze has stymied syndication.In January last year the company unveiled an unexpected slowdown in revenue at its UK stores in the Christmas trading quarter, with retail growth of 1.5 per cent on a like-for-like basis. It agreed in April to be taken over by KKR and Stefano Pessina, its then deputy chairman, in Europe’s biggest-ever leveraged buy-out.Mr Pessina argued at the time that he would be able to drive Alliance Boots faster as a privately held group than as a listed company. The group is believed to be looking at strengthening its international division.
332;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2008-01-10T22:03:51Z;Branson launches healthcare business;;Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group launched a groundbreaking foray into the NHS primary healthcare market on Thursday with a call to family doctors to join them in establishing a network of branded clinics.Ministers welcomed Virgin Healthcare’s decision to open the first of six “one-stop-shop” health centres later this year, which could offer services from homeopathy to therapy alongside typical GP services.After two years of planning, the group embarked on its first advertising campaign on Thursday to stir interest among family doctors in joining its health centres.Under the business model, GPs would retain their existing contracts but Virgin would manage funds the doctors receive for staff costs and rental. Virgin would then offer a range of additional NHS and private services to visiting patients, including dentistry, screening, a pharmacy “and a range of conventional and complementary therapies”.Mark Adams, Virgin Healthcare chief executive, said that while GPs would retain their existing contracts, “it would change the delivery model from something designed in 1946 to something that better serves today’s world”.He said the group was “there to help GPs rather than to threaten them”. Virgin has no plans to bid for alternative provider contracts from primary care trusts.Virgin’s move comes as the government is looking to open 250 new GP practices and health centres over the next few years, 100 surgeries in under-doctored areas, and 150 other new health centres with extended opening hours elsewhere in the country.Mark Britnell, director of commissioning at the department of health, said £250m a year had been earmarked for the new services, “and we are very pleased that Virgin and others are prepared to offer them”.Over the next five or so years, “there is a potential business here worth more than £1bn for Virgin, Assura, Boots and other private-sector providers to bid into, alongside existing GPs and foundation trusts”.By offering its brand and managing the operation of centres, Virgin’s business model differs from that of providers such as Assura, which focus on providing capital and project management. Alliance Boots also provides local services and has opened a healthcare centre in its Poole store, but it leases space to the NHS rather than providing services directly.Virgin is planning a “road-show” through 26 towns and cities – including Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol – to explain its plans in more detail to doctors. The group is recruiting dentists, therapists and hygienists, dental nurses and health centre managers.Ben Bradshaw, health minister, welcomed the launch. “I am pleased that Virgin Healthcare is proposing to work with GPs to help develop more integrated services for patients,” he said. “We want to see the fullest possible range of service providers, including independent sector partners, developing innovative proposals to promote better health, improve patient access and develop more personalised care for patients”.
333;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-12-28T17:11:43Z;What 2008 may hold for the Rock, Rio and the rest;;It’s that time of year. Here are Lombard’s unscientific forecasts of the themes of 2008 and the people to watch.Rock or millstone? It’s not hard to predict which story will dominate the political and financial headlines in the first part of 2008.Some form of nationalisation of Northern Rock remains the most likely escape route for the government. But it will only get messier from here. Shareholders such as Philip Richards of RAB Capital and Jon Wood of SRM will continue to seek satisfaction. The longer this goes on, the more likely it is to end in the courts.Hostile is the new friendly. Two large bids must be formalised in the New Year: BHP Billiton for Rio Tinto and Carlsberg-Heineken for Scottish & Newcastle.One Lombard prediction that came true in 2007 was that bidders would continue to hunt down venerable British names found in our own FT30 index: Alliance Boots, EMI and ICI (though not yet delisted) all succumbed, eventually, to agreed deals.Both the Rio and S&N bids have the potential to go hostile, as the target boards have so far shown little inclination to open up. If they continue to be intransigent, Carlsberg and Heineken are more likely to launch an “unrecommended” offer than BHP. The dual-listed structure of both Rio and BHP makes the mining bid more complex and difficult to consummate without some co-operation between the parties – and S&N shares have been trading below Carlsberg and Heineken’s indicative approach.Whatever the outcome of these deals, keep an eye on the people involved: four of the chief executives – Marius Kloppers at BHP, Tom Albanese at Rio, Jorgen Buhl Rasmussen at Carlsberg and John Dunsmore at S&N – are relatively new to their roles. They may deny it, but they have a lot at stake personally.Does Turquoise feel blue? With the markets in financial instruments directive (Mifid) already in place, 2008 ought to be the year for Project Turquoise to mount a concerted assault on the London Stock Exchange, among others. The threat is still not making Clara Furse, LSE chief executive, quake. She has just spent her first Christmas since 2004 without the distraction of a bid and, in spite of speculation that now may be her moment to seek a post elsewhere, she seems reinforced by having kept the exchange independent. Investment banks must decide whether to maintain the pressure, or concentrate on resolving problems closer to home.On the same topic, 2008 will see those banks competing with a far simpler offering of wholesale products. The message will be: you can have any flavour you want, as long as it’s vanilla. How will they differentiate themselves from each other?Next year in banking will also be when the Fred-versus-John contest gets serious. Sir Fred Goodwin of Royal Bank of Scotland and John Varley of Barclays did battle last year for ABN Amro. Both claimed a sort of victory. RBS and its allies bought the Dutch bank, but Barclays came away with useful emerging market investors on its share register and, critically, claims it didn’t overpay. Sir Fred will be vindicated if he can prove the complex – and expensive – deal was worth it.The failure of the Qataris to land J Sainsbury was one of the biggest unconsummated deals of this year. One of the questions left open is: whither Justin King? The retail group’s chief executive would have been a big winner if the takeover had succeeded. His task in 2008 is to sustain morale among staff, try to restore the share price and maintain the pursuit of Tesco. It looks a tall order – and a humdrum one, especially placed against the rich rewards of a buy-out.Lombard was on the mark a year ago in predicting that the buy-out firms would come under pressure to adopt higher standards of transparency and governance. 2008 will be the year in which sovereign wealth funds are asked to open up. The International Monetary Fund is drawing up “best practice” guidelines for the wealth funds. But persuading them to do so could be far more difficult than encouraging hedge funds and private equity funds to subscribe to the UK codes that were drawn up during 2007. Even so, an enlightened wealth fund or two will volunteer more transparency next year. The others will have to be dragged into the limelight.Lombard’s other predictions were a mixed bag. Ed Balls did leave the Treasury, but his departure hasn’t resulted in a marked deterioration in City-Westminster relations. As for an official backlash against foreign takeovers: no sign yet. It only remains to point out the column’s prescience in suggesting that 2007 would be dominated by a liquidity crisis leading to an emergency government bail-out and Britain’s first run on a bank in more than a century. If only.Happy New Year.Lombard returns on January 3.
334;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-12-23T20:49:11Z;Baugur vows to stick with UK;;Baugur has said it will not turn its back on the UK high street – even after the Icelandic investment group saw the value of its investments in quoted retailers fall by more than £100m this year.Stakes in Woolworths, French Connection, Moss Bros, Booker and Debenhams – once worth £370m ($734m) – are valued at about £250m. Baugur holds the stakes via its Unity Investments vehicle with financial affiliate FL Group and entrepreneur Kevin Stanford.Speaking in the Baugur London offices, Gunnar Sigurdsson – this year made chief executive – ruled out a fire sale of assets in the new year. “I think 2008 will be quite interesting,” he said.“Given the valuations, we would be more likely to be on the buying side rather than the selling side.”Baugur is expected to wait to see how Moss Bros trades over Christmas before deciding whether to bid for the menswear chain, one of the first clothing retailers to issue a pre-Christmas profit warning and cut prices.It could also be interested in French Connection should Stephen Marks wish to reduce his 42 per cent shareholding or sell the business.Next month the Icelanders can bid for Debenhams, after ruling themselves out for six months in July. Woolworths is another possible bid from within the portfolio, although Baugur has criticised the management at the variety retailer. The Booker stake is likely to go down rather than up.Baugur was not at the forefront of acquisitions in 2007 – a year that saw the £10.6bn acquisition of Alliance Boots and two attempts to buy J Sainsbury for more than £10bn. The last big deal was the £351m acquisition of the House of Fraser department store chain in 2006.“We stayed out of some of the big market buy-outs . . . because we thought they were over-leveraged,” said Mr Sigurdsson. “I would be worried if we were sitting there with five, six, seven times leverage.”Mr Sigurdsson maintains that Baugur’s investments are comfortably financed and need not be sold, although it has owned some for several years and analysts could argue that it is time for an exit. “We’ve been involved with some of them a while [but] at the moment it’s not the most exciting market [for an exit].”
335;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-12-21T20:23:27Z;On London: Depression prevails in the retail sector;;"Depression prevails in the retail sector: not a fitting mood for one of the busiest days of the shopping calendar.In spite of slightly stronger-than- expected sales numbers for November released yesterday, there remain concerns about consumer spending over the medium term.But first there are a few weeks of artificial buoyancy to get through.Unless there is a serious recession, most people do not cut down on presents for their family at Christmas. Then come the January sales, which will lure the bargain hunters. Then it is February, traditionally a dead month after the festive splurge.What the stock market has begun to price in for the retail sector is a tougher 2008, starting in March. The FTSE-All Share general retail sector has fallen 28 per cent this year, while the wider market is broadly flat.Bullish investors might take solace in the fact that forward price/earnings ratios have fallen back to their long-term average of about 12 after the end of the debt binge. But most analysts are more circumspect: first, that is not cheap, just more sensible; second, earnings forecasts will come down, so it is artificial.The credit squeeze has proved severely damaging. Gone is much of the takeover premium, from Home Retail in the FTSE 100 to Woolworths among the small caps.This was a significant factor earlier in the year when Alliance Boots was taken private and J Sainsbury almost fell twice to private bidders. Both deals were valued at more than £10bn. Deals that size are in the deep freeze at the moment; never mind that the retail sell-off means that within the sector only Tesco commands a market value that big anyway.For a slightly more positive view, talk to some of the dealmakers. Guy Weldon, partner at Bridgepoint, is still actively pursuing consumer industries deals – acquisitions and disposals, such as the Pets At Home chain – even amid turbulent debt markets. “It’s not going to be an obstacle to getting a transaction,” he says. “We are more cautious about it because we would be mad not to be.” But he adds that deals below about £1.5bn are eminently doable. That encompasses most of UK retail.Indebted companies have also been punished by the credit squeeze. Take Kingfisher, operator of B&Q, which was placed on negative outlook by Standard & Poor’s this week amid concern about its low fixed charge cover, the cooling housing market and lacklustre like-for-like sales.Another apparent positive is the number of attractive dividend yields – such as DSG International at close to 9 per cent – but sadly this is more a reflection of bombed out share prices than well covered largesse. Bank on a cut to DSG’s payout when its new chief executive gets to grips.There are sensible havens amid the retail gloom – and that doesn’t mean deserting the sector for defensive staples such as utilities. Retail has its own. Halfords, for example, has not been hit as hard as some but still trades 24 per cent below its year high and on a forward p/e of 11. That seems too low for a business with a decent dividend yield; a possible medium- term acquirer in Autobacs Seven, which owns 5 per cent of the shares; and, most important, makes a third of revenue from non-discretionary car maintenance products such as wiper blades.Then there are the supermarkets – particularly that great machine of a business that frightens its critics and delights price-conscious shoppers. Unfortunately, Tesco trades at a not too price-conscious 17 times forward earnings – not a steal for would-be investors. But given the defensive qualities of food, coupled with its international prospects, it is the best quoted retailer on the market.But the real winner in 2007, the class act in servicing customers and developing online, and with new stores, is John Lewis Partnership. Unfortunately, like much of the high street, it is not quoted: you will have to work there to benefit."

JP Morgan Cazenove, the Anglo-US joint venture which advised Kohlberg Kravis Roberts on the deal, won Private Equity Financial Adviser of the Year.3i, the UK-listed venture capital group, was named Private Equity Firm of the Year after impressing judges with the sheer intensity of its activity. 3i notched up 26 buy-outs and 42 exits.
337;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-12-14T02:07:32Z;Pfizer’s example proves contagious;;When Pfizer took direct control of distribution of its medicines across the UK last spring, it soon noticed curious patterns in orders for Genotropin, a growth hormone for children.One pharmacy requested 300 packets at a time, although the drug is so rarely used it was unlikely it would have had more than a single prescription to fulfil each month in the community it served. The pharmacist was ordering large quantities of the drug to resell to other pharmacists at a higher price.This chemist was part of a relatively widespread pattern among retailers and wholesalers alike of reselling medicines within the UK, and even elsewhere in Northern Europe and North America where they can realise still greater profits.While legal, the trade was one of several practices that reduced Pfizer’s margins, as well as leading to supply shortages for which it would be criticised. But until this year – in line with standard industry practice – it sold its drugs to wholesalers and had no influence over their subsequent distribution.“We got the blame but we had very little control,” says Dave Watson, European commercial director for Pfizer. “The wholesaler decided prices and stock availability.”Pfizer decided to change its distribution practices, retaining ownership of its medicines until they reached pharmacists, and paying a fixed fee for their distribution via a single wholesaler, UniChem. That enables it to reduce and to adapt the discounts it offers, to control supplies more tightly and to build closer links with pharmacists.But its decision to sell directly to pharmacies has had wide ramifications. It has meant imitation by other pharmaceutical companies, concern by medicine distributors and pharmacies, and a probe from the Office of Fair Trading concluded this week.UniChem’s rivals complain Pfizer’s exclusive arrangement is particularly invidious, since its medicines represent about 10 per cent of all prescription medicines in the UK. Pharmacists express concern they too have been squeezed and are dependent on a single distributor.The OFT is now calling for the distribution arrangements to be reconsidered as part of negotiations currently taking place on the complex British Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS).In the current system pharmaceutical companies negotiate a price with the Department of Health. The pharmaceutical companies are allowed to add 12.5 per cent to cover distribution costs. Most companies then sell their products at this discount to a network of wholesalers that supplies the medicines to pharmacies.Panos Kanavos, an academic at the London School of Economics specialising in medicine pricing, says the discount is about twice as high as in the rest of Europe, and still greater than US levels. “It’s a source of inefficiency for the NHS,” he says.But pharmaceutical wholesalers say they typically retain only 1.5 per cent, passing on most of the discount to pharmacists.Sue Sharp, chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, which represents pharmacies in their reimbursement arrangements with government, says 10.5 per cent of the discount is in turn deducted from the payment made by the NHS to her members on each medicine prescribed. She says that leaves most with little or no profit beyond the 94p fee they receive on each prescription fulfilled. She says Pfizer has undercut the arrangement still further, with discounts as low as 8.5 per cent, which can leave pharmacists out of pocket. “There is no profit or a small net loss.”But pharmacies and wholesalers gain from discounts on off-patent generic drugs with less draconian reimbursement rules.They are also increasingly vertically integrated – through joint ownership of UniChem and Boots or AAH and Lloyds, for instance – which adds greater scope to maximise returns from the system.If Pfizer now gains from using the different discounts to its own advantage, many see the company’s strategy as driven by a desire to squeeze out “parallel traders,” the arbitragers who buy medicines in EU countries where they are sold cheaply, in order to repackage and resell them in higher priced markets.

Altogether the OFT received 482 complaints from pharmacies and doctors about the Pfizer-Unichem deal.AstraZeneca and several other manufacturers are implementing similar changes, the OFT said, though only Pfizer has limited distribution to a single wholesaler.In response, Pfizer said the arrangement with UniChem did not increase the cost of its medicines to the NHS. The US-based company also welcomed the OFT’s acknowledgement that “such schemes may also give rise to efficiencies in distribution.”John Young, managing director of Pfizer in the UK: “Patient safety is our paramount concern. Our scheme has resulted in increased confidence in the secure supply of Pfizer medicines.”UniChem added that the Pfizer scheme showed “excellent service levels”. “We are looking forward to engaging in a constructive dialogue with the Department of Health,” it said.John Fingleton, OFT chief executive, said: “The changes to the distribution of medicines in the UK are among the most significant for many years and have given rise to real concerns…Action is needed to prevent increases in NHS medicines costs and to ensure service standards pharmacies to patients are of a satisfactory standard.”DTP schemes allow manufacturers to increase the prices paid by retail pharmacies (chemists shops) and control the distribution of their products, the OFT said. The manufacturer sets the prices paid by pharmacies and pays its selected wholesaler a fee for delivering their medicines.This contrasts with the traditional model of drug distribution, in which manufacturers supply medicines to competing wholesalers, typically at a 12.5 per cent discount to list prices. The wholesalers then compete to supply pharmacies by offering their own discounts, which average about 10.5 per cent according to the OFT study.The OFT has decided not to open a formal investigation of the drug distribution market under the Competition Act or to refer it to the Competition Commission.Instead, it said the best way forward was for the government to take DTP arrangements into account as it renegotiates the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme with manufacturers. For example, list prices of drugs could be cut by an amount equivalent to the average discounts received by pharmacies.The OFT also recommended that the government should agree minimum service standards with manufacturers for drug distribution. “Any deterioration in service levels should be reflected in the prices paid for medicines by the NHS,” it said.

340;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-12-10T15:23:44Z;Reckitt buys US pharmaceutical group;;Reckitt Benckiser, the UK household goods maker, on Monday agreed to buy Adams Respiratory Therapeutics, a small US pharmaceutical group, for $2.3bn as it outlined plans to build a global empire in over-the-counter drugs.Adams, which owns cough and congestion drugs Mucinex and Delsym, gives Reckitt a foothold in the US. It now plans to expand sales of the two drugs in overseas markets.Bart Becht, Reckitt’s chief executive, described the acquisition as “a substantial step forward” for his company.He said it would allow Reckitt to use the skills it had gained in branding and marketing household products in the consumer healthcare business.“Consumer healthcare is principally a fast-moving consumer goods business and an attractive one,” Mr Becht said, adding he believed Reckitt could double Adams’ annual sales over the next three years to almost $700m.Reckitt ranks ninth among the world’s top 10 consumer healthcare companies, the biggest of which is Johnson & Johnson. Reckitt shares rose 59 pence, or 2 per cent, to £29.83 (£59.81). The deal would bolster Reckitt’s fast-growing health and personal care division, which was transformed at the start of last year when it acquired Boots Healthcare International for £1.9bn.The Boots acquisition gave Reckitt leading European OTC drug brands, including Strepsils and Nurofen. Mr Becht said: “We have already shown with the acquisition of BHI that we can generate shareholder value in consumer healthcare.” Until the Boots deal, healthcare had been a small part of Reckitt’s businesses.The group is best known for household cleaning products such as Cillit Bang and Lysol, as well as personal care products such as Veet hair remover.Reckitt has no plans to start selling its European drug brands in the US but said it would keep this option under review.Adams does not have approval to expand into the prescription drug market but has expanded rapidly, with sales growing from $13m in the year to June 2003 to $332m in the year to June 2007.Reckitt will offer Adams’ shareholders $60 a share in cash, a premium of nearly 73 per cent to the group’s closing share price on Friday of $43.68.
341;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-12-09T19:17:55Z;High St names consider MBOs;;"The plunging share prices of some of the high street’s biggest names could usher in a series of buy-outs, according to bankers, consultants and retailers. Clinton Cards has told the Financial Times that it might consider a management buy-out and is likely to be joined by others, following the likes of Carpetright, where a positive update on an offer from founder Lord Harris is expected on Tuesday.Baugur, the Icelandic investment group, is moving closer to a long-anticipated bid for Moss Bros, the men’s clothing chain that issued a profits warning last week.The fund already has a 29 per cent stake – along with fashion entrepreneur Kevin Stanford – and two seats on the board.Marchpole, the fashion brands company, has said it could consider an MBO, while one retail consultant said he was advising private equity firms on three possible takeovers of sub-£1bn retailers.In the past 12 months, shares in Clinton Cards have fallen 14 per cent, Moss Bros by 44 per cent and Marchpole by 59 per cent.Much of the retail sell-off interest has occurred since the credit squeeze of mid-August – the general retail sector has underperformed the broader market by more than 15 per cent in this time.This year is still likely to be the high watermark of retail acquisition activity in the current economic cycle, with Alliance Boots being taken private for £11bn and J Sainsbury coming close to being acquired in two
separate private equity approaches.The subsequent credit squeeze has put a dampener on most deals of that size but the retail sector boasts a large number of small and mid-cap companies where directors have large stakes and are tempted to try a buy-out after seeing the shares slide.Clinton Lewin, managing director of Clinton Cards and son of the chain’s founder, said of an MBO: “Yes, we’ve looked at it and it’s there in the background.”Some think that private equity approaches and management buy-ins from companies with a consumer specialism, such as Bridgepoint and Lion Capital, are more likely.“One trend might be external management teams assessing the opportunity to turn around underperforming assets which are unloved in the current market,” said Mervyn Metcalfe, a managing director of investment banking at Merrill Lynch.However, he added: “Buyers will wait to see how Christmas turns out.“I don’t think people will be rushing into deals in the early new year, but the sector remains attractive to many private investors.”Baugur has seen the value of its portfolio of retail investments – which includes Woolworths, French Connection and Moss Bros – fall sharply this year.But the group has stressed that it is “more likely” to increase its stakes in such companies rather than sell out.A bid before Christmas for Moss Bros – which has been anticipated for more than a year – would not necessarily be welcomed by the retailer’s board as it looks to deal with the busiest trading season and difficult sales.No approach has been made."
342;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-11-30T19:53:11Z;How Burren’s brinkmanship nearly took it over the edge;;"How close did Burren Energy come to blowing it? An extra 30p was all it took for Eni of Italy to win a recommendation for its bid from the UK oil exploration and production company, having had its £12 bid rejected less than two weeks ago. With weird precision, Burren preferred to say that the difference was an additional £42,332,082. Either way, just 2.5 per cent separated an offer that did not “reflect the fundamental and strategic value of [Burren’s] assets” from one that apparently does.The switch from seemingly staunch opposition to craven acceptance is a common feature of merger negotiations. Keith Henry, Burren’s chairman, went so far as to describe the Eni bid yesterday as “the culmination of a period of outstanding value creation”. But it is hard to avoid the feeling that this almost ended in embarrassment for the target company.It would be harsh to blame Burren alone for the near-miss. Eni’s tactics on the weekend that ended with its surprise withdrawal were heavy-handed and the UK group has finally emerged with an offer at a creditable 51 per cent premium to the average price before any bidders appeared. Also, as Lex pointed out at the time, it would have been no disaster if Burren had had to stride on as an independent.Burren clearly thought it could afford to take a stern tone with a much larger bidder, partly because Eni knew other buyers had expressed an interest, partly because the oil price had firmed since the Italians made their initial approach. The fact that the shares fell “only” 15 per cent on the day Eni announced it was calling off its courtship reflected that. But with analysts starting to cut their target prices, the board’s brinkmanship almost took the shares over the edge.Those investors that assumed Eni had ruled itself out missed a 23 per cent rally over the past two weeks to Friday’s close of £12.49. Their misfortune is a reminder that, rare though it may be, a recommendation always trumps the Takeover Code’s insistence that bidders that withdraw have to stay away for at least six months. The 19p premium to the sweetened bid now looks like a bet on the slim chance of a counter-bidder paying over £13.20 – the rich price at which irrevocable commitments to the Eni bid would disintegrate. But it may also reflect investors’ determination not to be caught out by the unexpected again.Boots on the other footThe first communiqué from the new owners of Alliance Boots in June was a pledge of transparency – a forerunner, if you will, of the guidelines for private equity disclosure published last week by Sir David Walker – and a promise to produce an annual performance review that would be a model of its kind.When a terse “Alliance Boots” announcement appeared on the regulatory news service on Friday, it therefore prompted intense media interest. It appeared to be the company’s half-yearly financial report, including the payment of a £1.55bn dividend, a business review and a statement of its future prospects (which are “good”). In fact, this announcement merely fulfilled the statutory obligation of a subsidiary of the new holding company to holders of a bond issued before the LBO. The dividend was a normal payment by one component of the new group structure to another. Like most such statements – normally filed to Companies House – it wasn’t meaningless, but it wasn’t that significant, either.The reaction, though, gave Alliance Boots’ owners – Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Stefano Pessina, the group’s executive chairman – an unexpected signal of what they and others running large private equity portfolio companies can expect when they produce their performance reviews. The message of this signal goes something like this: Yes, you are being held to a higher standard than other private companies. Yes, you will have to explain yourselves in more detail and at greater length to “stakeholders” who can’t tell the difference between consolidated and unconsolidated accounts. And no, I’m afraid you have no margin for error.Unsafe savings ratesWhen banks and building societies are falling over each other to hand you money, you should usually beware. But the savings rate bonanza currently under way holds more dangers for the financial institutions themselves than for their lucky customers.It is possible that credit turmoil and economic uncertainty have increased the pool of savings, as individuals flee to cash from equities or property. But the suspicion is that the banks are mainly chasing the same fickle savers.While big building societies and banks such as Nationwide or Barclays could benefit as savvy savers switch to better rates, the smaller fry are certain to come under pressure. An increase in savings rates will cut into their margins, particularly if they also have to spend more on marketing. At a time when some lenders are struggling to finance mortgages in wholesale markets, a failure to find enough depositors would jeopardise the whole business.If there are no more new savers, there will have to be fewer savings accounts. Customers should take advantage; banks and building societies should look out."
343;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-11-30T13:50:33Z;Charles Pretzlik: Burren bid is not the end;;The big corporate event of the day in the UK so far is Burren Energy agreeing to an improved bid from Eni. The shares, however, are trading through the £12.30 offer price, suggesting this process may not be over yet. Eni has irrevocables from about 21 per cent of the shares but these lapse if a rival offer comes in at £13.20 or above.We’ll have more to do on the bidding for Northern Rock. There is some buzz around on Sky News and the wires about JC Flowers considering withdrawing its interest. We picked something up about this last night but are wary of these sorts of stories. If they do pull out, that would leave Luqman Arnold as the only real alternative to Virgin. His proposal has a lot going for it but Arnold is the negative image of Branson (light on pizzazz, long on substance), which ought to be a good thing, except that he has to win over politicians with their backs against the wall.Also, Alliance Boots, now owned by KKR and Stefano Pessina, seems to have paid an interim dividend of £1.5bn. There is some dispute about whether this is meaningful or a technicality. We’ll get to the bottom of it and let you know.Colt saw its shares leap 35 per cent on talk of a bid from AT&T. Movements in this stock are exaggerated by the small free float caused by the Fidelity holding. The company has since said it knows of no reason for the movement in its shares.Finally, have a chuckle at the expense of Providence Resources, which today proudly announced it had agreed a new $250m revolving credit facility with Macquarie. However, the RNS statement went out at first with some amusing editing marks left in: “Providence Resources P.l.c.

344;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-11-27T19:34:31Z;Sir David Walker: Interview transcript;;"Andrew Hill, FT associate editor talks to Sir David Walker, senior adviser to Morgan Stanley and author of the recently published Guidelines for Disclosure in the Private Equity IndustryAndrew Hill: Welcome to View from the Top. I’m here with Sir David Walker, Senior Adviser to Morgan Stanley and author of the recently published Guidelines for Disclosure in the Private Equity Industry. Sir David, what do you think caused the backlash against private equity in the UK earlier this year which helped prompt the guidelines?DW: I think there had been very rapid growth in private equity at the big buyout end over the previous two or three years, which really came to a head with the propositions that were then in the market. This is late winter, early spring this year that iconic names like Alliance Boots and possibly Sainsbury’s might become portfolio companies of private equity; a lot of them did. Alliance Boots was acquired by KKR Funds. And I think the fact that private equity, which had previously, at any rate in the UK, not reached out to so large and iconic situations, that was one major element. It had grown very rapidly to a position in which now private equity in the UK has a bigger penetration of the private sector than, as far as we can tell, any other developed country. It employs between 8% and 9% of the private sector workforce, which is very significant. On top of that there was, I think, a growing sense that alongside these rights of ownership that private equity is acquiring, there was an inadequate recognition of the accountability to society widely. And I think there was also frankly some clumsiness, an insensitivity with the activities of some of these big transactions in the way they dealt with employees and their workforce. I think it was more a problem of perception and of communication than the substance but, nonetheless, by the time I was asked to take on this review, there was quite a ferment of worry, nervousness, anxiety that had to be addressed.FT: So how much cooperation did you get from the firm by the time you’d started the review? How keen were they? How much resistance did you encounter?DW: It was they who took the initiative to ask me to take on this review process, so I think by the end of February, early March this year they realised that the position they were in was unsustainable and there would be continuing criticism, flack and a tension of a kind they really didn’t seek, being private by disposition and as a matter of choice not to be in the quoted business was something they wanted to mitigate.FT: You produced proposals and then you produced last week the final guidelines. Would you say the final guidelines were stronger than the proposals? Were there things that you had to abandon because of resistance?DW: Well, both. And I think it was evenly balanced. There were some things that I decided went too far. To give one example, I proposed that the private equity firms themselves should produce an attribution analysis. This is analysis of how private equity makes its real economic gains and the three elements which are very important to have clearly laid out are financial leverage, which a lot of people think is the source of a lot of private equities’ gains. The second is the improvement in the market environment for the particular company or area that the portfolio company is in, and then third, let’s call it superior management, sharper operating performance, a more speedily and effectively implemented strategy. I proposed in July that the private equity firms themselves should do an analysis and publish it in their annual review. I came away from that proposition in the final guidelines. The reason, which have some have thought was in response to pressure from the private equity firms, was not that at all. I came to realise that this is quite a complicated piece of analysis which requires fairly serious subjective judgement and I became unconfident about requiring firms to produce something which would, in every case, be done in a different way and would not be comparable. So the proposition I’ve made – and this is consistent with the whole shift of my guidelines towards emphasis on what needs to be done at the centre – is that the centre of the industry association, the British Venture Capital Association, should develop over time a template to which all firms would be asked to conform and then there would be a set of attribution analyses that would be broadly comparable. The problem is that if we didn’t have a template which was broadly agreed at the outset, I have to say I have some scepticism, no, cynicism, that the firms would be tempted to put the most favourable gloss on the performance they’ve achieved in relation to portfolio investments they’ve made. I think we need standardisation and I certainly didn’t want my name to be on a proposition that would be capable of, let’s say, manipulation and spin. So my hope is that in relation to the attribution analysis, after a year or so there will be a template; I’ve laid out the principles very clearly, but there still needs to be more work done - and it requires experience and time – and that in a year or so’s time the guidelines can be modified to require attribution analysis to be done by each private equity firm. An area where I tightened my requirements substantially, there are two examples. One was to require the institution, the establishment of a formal and independent monitoring process to ensure that there is conformity with the guidelines and, if appropriate, to take action if either a portfolio company or a private equity firm is not in conformity. Another area of significant tightening up from the July consultative proposals is to apply the business review obligations of our companies’ legislation, which is legislation as recent as 2006, which was designed in the statute to apply only to quoted companies, I’m proposing in my guidelines that all the provisions of the business review section of the 2006 Act would apply to private equity portfolio companies. That’s quite tough; it requires information to be made available about employees, about circumstances, conditions of employment, about the approach to corporate social responsibility in the environment, and is therefore designed to give clear guidance to portfolio companies about these areas of concern that prompted this initiative in the first place.FT: A lot of people wanted this review and guidelines to insist on more transparency on pay and remuneration. In fact a lot of people think the backlash against private equity was due to concerns about pay. Was that ever on the table and, if not, why not?DW: Well, I thought about it a great deal but I think a lot of the criticism and concern is misconceived. The parallel is drawn with companies that are quoted, where there are significant obligations under both the legislation and the combined code that evolved subsequently. I am myself chairman of the Remuneration Committee of a quoted company so I’m very familiar with the obligations that are on the board of a quoted company to be transparent about the terms and conditions of engagement, the pay, the options and so-on of executive directors. Well, in relation to portfolio companies in private equity, there are not as demanding but clear obligations under the 2006 Companies Act. The remuneration package for the highest paid director is required to be included in the Annual Report, together with the total cost of the compensation of the whole board. That’s less than is required for quoted companies but, in my opinion, is appropriate and I saw no need to change that provision in relation to private companies that are owned by private equity.FT: Do you personally think that pay is excessive in the private equity industry?DW: No, I don’t, no.FT: Do you think it’s a problem?DW: No, I don’t think it’s a problem. But let me go on to talk about the area that I think that of principle focus, which is the pay of the advisors or managers or executives of the private equity firms themselves. And an inappropriate analogy is drawn with the transparency of the pay of corporate executives in the quoted companies. That analogy is quite inappropriate. If you think of the managers or the institutional investors in quoted companies, we know very little about their pay terms and conditions and all the rest, and many of them work in boutiques or partnerships in respect of them. There is no obligation to reveal terms and conditions of their engagement. There are three points I’d like to emphasise here. One is that the provision for transparency in relation to quoted companies relates to the concern of owners, which there are 150,000 in most quoted companies, to have full disclosure. And this is the only way publicly that one can communicate with the owners of listed companies. In the case of privately owned companies communication is possible privately because there are so few owners, typically perhaps 150 in a large buyout fund. Beyond that though, remember that the comparison of the private equity executive ought to be with the institutional investor or a money manager in respect of whom there is very little obligation for reporting on terms and conditions. The third and last, it’s a fact that has not been adequately taken into account in all the criticism of the lack of openness about compensation is first that a big element in the compensation of private equity executives is carry. It’s capital, not income. There’s a very good reason why that is a significant element in the compensation of a private equity executive: he is exposed to risk and may get no carry and frequently that is the case. But of course the focus is on the situation where there is a very big payout after a period of time. The other factor that’s very relevant here is that these guidelines are being applied in a way that is unique in private equity around the world. No other country has any arrangement of this kind in relation to regulation in any way of private equity, which is one of the most mobile international businesses. I think were we to require private equity executives in the UK to disclose their compensation arrangements which, as I’ve said, I think is not necessary and inappropriate, but were we to do so, their ability to move offshore or to ensure that the relevant contract was not within the UK jurisdiction, would be remarkably easy, but they won’t do that.FT: Do you feel as though you emerge from this process as a friend of private equity? Does private equity think of you as a friend of the industry, as a result of what you came up with?DW: I think you should ask private equity about their attitude to me. My own position, as I said to the select committee when my independence was challenged in July, was independence is a state of mind and I approach this with a wholly independent state of mind. I’m very sympathetic to the concerns that have been expressed by the unions, and to some extent by left wing politicians about the lack of openness which breeds suspicion. I think I’m also very realistic about what it is that private equity is able to contribute to the UK economy, with which I think we are better off. So my position would be that I would like to be seen as independent. Friend? I think I would like them to say to you that I listened. I think everyone who wanted to communicate with me got a hearing, that’s limited partners, unions, many independent politicians, the select committee, the government and private equity. I would like to say, at this point, that one feature of the present situation which I think is the most unsatisfactory, and it’s still unsatisfactory, is not the lack of openness by the private equity firms themselves, firm by firm, but the really very unsatisfactory degree of ignorance we have about what private equity generates for the whole economy. And we don’t have good data. There are some quite interesting sample surveys that are indicative of some very positive effects from private equity for the whole economy, in terms of employment gain, productivity, the rapid growth in ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), that’s earnings, and in enterprise value of companies in which private equity at the big buy out end has invested. But if the question is, are those sample surveys adequate and dependable, with all respect to the professionals who have done them, Ernst and Young, McKinsey, the Harvard Business School, my answer is no, they’re not good enough, and we need much broader samples. I say all this because, in contrast with where my thinking was in July, when we published a consultative document, I would now place much greater weight on the recommendations to the industry association to be a real centre of excellence in the collection, processing, verification of data. And in then producing really high quality, evidence based analysis. And we just don’t have enough of that. No other country does, so we could create a model here, and I think that’s a really exciting challenge.FT: You’ve talked about extending, potentially, some of these guidelines, or your hope that some of these guidelines will be taken up by other privately owned companies, be it family owned or sovereign wealth funds, how realistic is that, and have you had any evidence in the last week or more from those quarters that there are companies, big private companies, outside private equity that are ready to take up the guidelines?DW: Not specifically, but the answer to your question, Andrew, is it realistic to expect some, perhaps not all, of these private equity like businesses to be brought in, my answer is affirmative. I’d make two observations. The first is, the only way of being certain to bring them in is by legislation. I think that would be an unfortunate way to go. I think this is such a dynamic environment that it would be a great pity to impose legislation which can have the effect of stultifying creativity and imagination. We need a set of guidelines that are capable of evolving over time, and there are many ways in which these guidelines could evolve over quite a short time period. As to those who are not currently in, I set out, in my final report, a principle, which I think is a good principle for people to work to, to cleave to, which is that if business if private equity like in the way it’s conducted, there’s a quite strong presumption that it ought to come within a framework of guidelines like mine. The most specific example I can think of are the sovereign wealth funds, whose significance has become, in a quite recent period, much greater than they appeared to be in February, March, when I started this exercise. And there is a specific instance, that’s the Qatari owned fund, Delta Three, which, if you recall, was making an offer for Sainsbury’s. In the event the offer was not proceeded with. In the context of that offer I had a conversation with them and suggested that it was in their interest to be participative in these guidelines and to conform voluntarily. And they agreed to do so, and included that commitment in their offer document. There are two reasons why it’s hard to expect that sort of response immediately. One, I think that the discipline, the catalyst, the concentration, of having an offer that you want to have accepted made them much readier to contemplate commitment than would be the case if they had no specific proposition on the table. The second is it was quite difficult for me to go and talk, as I’ve done in a limited way with one or two of these sovereign wealth funds, including Dubai, without being able to lay before them a set of guidelines. I think it would have been unrealistic to say to a sovereign wealth fund, would you please commit, when I wasn’t in a position to show them the guidelines. So I came to the conclusion that the practical course was to deliver this, so to speak, to the industry association with a clear statement of the principle, private equity like business ought to be brought into these guidelines, and urge the industry association to take the initiative and take it forward. And this they’ve indicated they’re determined to do. Now, which others, beyond the sovereign wealth funds? I think a characteristic that is particularly private equity like is where there’s a business that is using leverage in a significant way, which I think creates a sort of division when one’s looking at private companies, long run family businesses that haven’t used, or don’t use, leverage as part of the way they operate, I would not have high on the priority list for inviting conformity. On the other hand, the individuals, wealthy individuals or families, who choose to go into private equity like business using leverage, Mr Tchenguiz is an example, seems to me to be the type of business situation where one would think that it would be appropriate to bring them into these guidelines. And I’m confident that the industry association will certainly have the conversations in short order, and I would expect a fairly positive response. Why would there not be a positive response? These private equity like businesses are seeking to do things in this, the most open economy in the world, for this kind of activity. It seems to me to be in their own interest to make the environment more receptive by demonstrating that they’re ready to be good citizens in conforming to the standards that have been established.FT: Let me move on to talk about the wider financial sector. We’re obviously still in a period of credit market turmoil. What is your prediction, if I can hold you to one, about how and when we might emerge from this period of turmoil? How do you see things working over the next few months?DW: Less positively than I did as recently as a month ago. I think the credit market environment has become materially worse, and the liquidity situation is much more difficult than I have to say I foresaw in these markets, both here in the UK but, of course, internationally, prominently including the United States. So I think a process that as recently as a month ago I thought would draw to a close in the very early part of next year, I think could run on well into the spring. And I think, specifically an most immediately, there will be a difficult time through the end year phase in the markets, when a lot of people had planned to be able to be reliant, for example, on the CP market, which may effectively cease to exist around the year end.FT: What do you think this tells us about the model of universal banking and the growth of mega banks? Not a day goes by without a Citigroup or an HSBC or one of the big banks having to disclose more about their exposure and it does cast some doubt in my mind on the worth of that model, if it can’t ride through this type of crisis easily.DW: Two observations. I think there’s a problem of a different kind, vis-à-vis the mega banks, which doesn’t have particularly to do with these credit problems, though it may be an element in them. I have a profound concern about whether banks that have more than 100, a 150,000 people doing business in a whole variety of functions are capable of being managed with the sort of ethos and culture that I believe is hugely significant in these international organisations. So there is some size point beyond which even the most inspired and best leadership, I think, faces a very uphill task. But specifically in relation to credit, I think the big lesson that has emerged from this, the largest lesson for the big banks that’s emerged from this recent process, which is very relevant also for the supervisors, the FSA, the Federal Reserve and their opposite numbers in all the major developed countries, is that it proved to be something of a myth that the banks could create special purpose vehicles, get them off balance sheet, not have responsibility for them after they had been established. The myth, or the reality of the myth, so to speak, starts to emerge now, and has been emerging in recent weeks, when those banks realised that they couldn’t cut these SPVs off, that their name was effectively on them, and they had to bring them back, as HSBC announced yesterday as one of the more recent cases, back onto balance sheet with capital needed to match the obligations that they were taking on. So I think there was a degree, for all of us, of unreality, perhaps self deception, that it was possible to create these vehicles. We would have called them in the past no recourse lending, or something of the kind, and almost forget them with no responsibility. That was unrealistic, and now the cost of that is having to be borne, and there is more, probably, to come.FT: You used to be a regulator, would you be a comfortable financial services regulator regulating the system as it is currently set up, because if it’s difficult for big bank chief executives to know what is happening in every corner, it must be even more difficult for regulators?DW: It’s hugely more difficult for regulators now than when I was doing that sort of job 20 years ago. But I’m a policy optimist in the sense that I believe, out of all these experiences, there are hugely important lessons to be learned and the really important thing, peculiarly important in the credit space, is that lessons are learned. Most of the bad experience of banks, over the ages not just recently, has come from bad credit experience, and I think if there is a criticism of banks and regulators that I make generically over a long period of time it’s been the failure to see, in the eye of a crisis, that there are really important lessons which must get embedded in the experience on which you draw going forward. To give a very specific, almost anecdotal, example it’s a normal practice in banks to let go, to put it more brutally, fire those who were responsible for credit judgements that went badly wrong. I think that may, in some cases, be completely justified if there was a lack of integrity and so on, but actually the experience of those who’ve had bad experience is extremely important to factor in to the knowledge base, the experience base, of a bank going forward. To some extent, it does concern me that people taking credit decisions in this recent phase have been, on average, in their late 30s and early 40s, with little accumulation of experience from previous credit crunch phases. So, I think we all have to do, regulators and banks alike, a better job of accumulating the lessons from this sort of experience, and embedding it in our new platforms for decision taking going forwards.FT: It sounds as though you think it should be, in a sense, an asset on somebody’s curriculum that they have lived through a credit crisis and taken the pain as well as the upside.DW: I think it’s very important. There’s a lustrum that I’ve always had in the business I’ve tried to do in Morgan Stanley and in trying to motivate young people, including those in the credit space, I’d say in particular, but elsewhere, that it’s pardonable to make mistakes. What is not pardonably is to make mistakes that have been made before, and that’s very often what happens in the credit space.FT: Obviously we’ve spaced in the UK a particular issue with the Northern Rock crisis. As a regulator how would you have handled that differently, if you would’ve handled it differently?DW: My principal reaction has been one of relief that I was not the regulator in this situation, but I think the serious response, Andrew, is that it’s not only the regulator. There is the regulator in the FSA, there is the responsibility, whatever that is, for the financial stability responsibility of the Central Bank, it’s concern about morally hazardous initiative. And that’s, as we see, an exquisitely difficult balance. I have to say my own position would now be, which is not where I started, that I’d like to see the bank doing more to put liquidity into the home market, and perhaps had that been done and a method of doing it had been found right up front, the beginning of this unhappy sequence, that would not have attracted the sort of publicity that now surrounds Northern Rock, many of the difficulties we now have could’ve been avoided.FT: Has the way it has been handled created a poor precedent for future crises? We hope, obviously, there won’t be another Northern Rock, but have things been done that will come back to haunt the Bank of England, the Treasury, or the FSA?DW: I think all three major institutions in the tripartite arrangement will be thinking, not merely looking at their navels and not merely being introspective, it’s too important for that, very seriously about the roles they respectively played. My own view, which goes back to 1997 when this structure was designed and put in place, is that it is a very good structure. I believe that the institutional arrangements we have, the architecture, is very good. I think the way it was used had perhaps not been adequately tested in advance. Maybe there wasn’t enough scenario planning in advance, and there was perhaps too great passivity about it. I believe that this tripartite structure could be made to work with much greater proactivity and engagement on a continuous basis among the parties, and would, I have to say, vote against the proposition which some are advancing of a quick return of all banking supervision to the Bank of England. I think that would be an unfortunate step. This model is a great model and can be made to work, plainly much better than it has this time round.FT: Has the crisis damaged the reputation of London as a financial centre and the city as a financial city?DW: Yes I think it has. I think there was, abroad in the United States and in Europe in particular, a sense that the UK could manage these things quietly and smoothly, as we have always done in the past. So, I think there is some damage to our reputations. It’s hugely important for those who, like me, think that the tripartite model can be made to work, to move very swiftly to demonstrate that we have confidence in it and to show how we believe it can be made to work. But, of course, the priority, Andrew, is getting through this very difficult market phase. And, my own aspiration is that the bank will see the financial stability responsibility that they have for markets as something which has acquired greater priority than the preoccupation they very properly have about not promoting a greater sense of moral hazard, which is a real problem, and I think those two are in the balance. But I would now give greater weight, significantly greater weight, to the financial stability concern, and moral hazard just has to be left aside for a time.FT: I detect among people I talk to in the city and elsewhere a sense of shock about the way in which things have unrolled at Northern Rock and in the regulation of Northern Rock. Were you surprised or shocked by some of the ways in which the authorities reacted, or indeed the public or customers of Northern Rock reacted?DW: Not surprised at the way the customers reacted because I think they had, not unreasonably, a sense that Northern Rock, like other British banks which are well capitalised, was as solid as a rock. So, the sense that they may not be able to get their money out, their deposits, when they wanted them, was, I think, very concerning for a lot of people. Of course, the visibility of the queues on television outside branches was partly because of television and had a high impact in very short order. Also, the fact that Northern Rock didn’t have many branches so the queues outside the branches they did have were rather large queues. Yes, but the larger question, a sense of, certainly I feel I’m part, and proud to be part, of the British financial establishment. I’ve worked on the public sector side in the Treasury, in the Bank of England as regulator, and more recently in the last 20 years or so, on the private sector side, and I feel I’m very much part of this establishment which I think has worked generally extraordinarily well in the interests of the UK. I think we’ve had a pretty serious blip. If the question, which I think, being a solution oriented individual, is the relevant question, how do we rebuild? Can we escape from this situation with lessons clearly learned? My answer is a robust positive. This is all reparable.FT: We’ve in the early stages of the next phase of liberalisation of European markets in financial instruments with Mifid (the Markets In Financial Instruments Directive), the Directive that’s opened this up. For the banks here in London, is this a threat or an opportunity, do you think?DW: I see it basically as an opportunity. I think that, despite the, let’s call them accidents, mishaps of the recent past, some of which have to be laid at the door of parties in the tripartite arrangement, but I want to move on from that and look forward. My view is market optimistic in the sense that the very openness of the London environment, the fact that significant players who are well capitalised are committed to behaving to high standards can operate here in an environment that has critical mass in terms of the workforce skill sets they can draw on, continues to be a major advantage for the UK in London as perhaps the most significant international financial centre. I think the fact that we now have Mifid means that there are more opportunities from this base to expand into Europe in the single market in the way in which in particular Charlie McCreevy has been concerned to promote it. And I don’t see the obviously matching capability of others on the continent to branch into, to open up and do business in other ways themselves, as something which is a threat to London. London has always been able to cope with competition, and I think provided we continue to be open and have the sort of regulation we have enjoyed, in general, absent some of the mishaps that we have seen recently, London can continue to be a major source of wealth generation and of employment generation for the UK.FT: So let’s play long short.

345;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
346;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-11-21T19:04:12Z;Private equity goes under the spotlight;;The cycle has turned for the titans of private equity. The squeeze in global credit markets has eroded advantages over listed rivals and made debate about new rules less pressing. A proposed code of conduct for big UK buy-out groups now lacks the impact it might have had six months ago. But, if the code earns the industry greater public acceptance, it will have served a useful purpose.This week’s report by Sir David Walker was commissioned when controversy over highly leveraged takeovers of household names, such as Alliance Boots, was at its height. It aims to lift the cloak of secrecy surrounding companies that spent £26bn on buy-out activity in 2006 and which employ 1.2m people, over 8 per cent of private sector workers.Sir David’s recipe for greater disclosure says large businesses acquired by private equity should adopt similar reporting standards to those of listed companies. Private equity groups themselves should publish annual reviews detailing investment strategy and companies they own. Despite the industry’s efforts to talk up the sacrifices, it is hard to see what is being given away. Those hoping to find out how much executives earn – mainly gains on the disposal of investments net of capital gains tax – will be no wiser. The code will be voluntary. For critics, this makes it toothless.However, the review’s limited results are no bad thing. The furore over private equity went too far. Before the deals dried up, industry bosses were cast as pariahs. The case against them – they asset-stripped companies and sacked workers – was ill-informed. Many have transformed struggling firms. Greater disclosure should address the key problem: ignorance.What Sir David’s report does not deal with is tax. On this, executives escaped lightly in the pre-Budget report. A higher capital gains rate of 18 per cent, up from 10 per cent, will have little effect on the advantages of doing business in Britain relative to overseas. Tax deductibility on interest payments, another benefit for buy-out groups, remains.The credit squeeze means that neither regulation nor taxation should be issues again for some time. If it leads to cost-cutting and job losses, however, then private equity will find itself back under a less forgiving spotlight. It is in companies’ own interests to do more than merely pay lip service to Sir David’s findings. The industry has become a powerful force in reshaping corporate Britain. Because private equity will continue to play an important economic role, it should adopt in full measures that address society’s anxieties.
347;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-11-20T14:19:46Z;Private equity deals start to fray in sharp market;;"Investors are bracing themselves for the ripples of the credit squeeze to hit some highly indebted companies.Research published today by accountancy Grant Thornton and law firm Latham & Watkins shows most financiers expect a significant number of private equity-owned companies to fall to distressed debt investors within two years.The first signs, however, are already visible in the market.The findings of the research underline why a growing number of investors has launched new distressed debt funds to capitalise on an expected surge in opportunities in this area.The survey – published at today’s FT Mergermarket private equity insight forum in London – interviewed 110 senior lending bankers, collateralised loan obligation managers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives in the UK and Europe.Fears about the impact of the credit squeeze on consumer spending and the housing market have eroded the value of debt issued to fund private equity acquisitions of companies in sectors stretching from from retail to property.Estate agents, such as Countrywide and Foxtons, and retailers, such as Fat Face and 20:20, are among the private equity-owned companies that have seen the value of their debt slide.The mood has darkened further as signs of recovery in investor demand for European leveraged loans in issue have evaporated, following a further fall in average prices bid for such debt since October.The second wave of fear over losses related to US mortgages and complex securities that has engulfed the banking sector in recent weeks has coincided with another downturn in the leveraged loan markets.The leveraged debt is held by a range of investors, including banks and collateralised debt obligations. But in the secondary market it is bought and traded by a vast number of hedge funds and specialist debt investors.Losses for lenders only months after they funded leveraged buy-outs of retail and property companies suggest debt investors fear these deals were priced too high with excessive debt and may now be facing trouble.Frits Prakke, managing director of Alchemy special opportunities fund, says: “We are in a market that is still very overpriced. I think private equity buying companies at the top of the market with record amounts of debt, as it has been, is a recipe for disaster.”However, private equity groups argue they are long-term investors who can hold these companies until their prospects improve, while their debt may be suffering from wider credit market jitters rather than any company-specific problems.One thing is clear. A mixture of growing risk-aversion and concerns about property prices and consumer spending in the UK has made debt investors much less inclined to own loans to private equity-backed retailers and estate agents.Fat Face, the ski- and surf-wear fashion chain bought by Bridgepoint in March for £360m, has seen the bank debt issued to fund the deal slide to about 82 per cent of its initial value. This has happened amid concerns that its high street outlets will be hit by a consumer slowdown.It is a similar story at Countrywide, the UK’s biggest chain of estate agents, bought by Apollo Management in May for £1.05bn, after a bidding war with 3i. The £640m of bonds issued to fund this deal were trading at the start of this month at just 55 per cent of their initial value on worries about a housing market crash.Some relief came with third-quarter results, sent to bondholders this month, that showed a better-than
-expected 6 per cent drop in revenues to £166m and an 18 per cent fall in underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to £16.1m. By Friday, the bonds were trading at 78 per cent of their initial value.“There was concern that the company might not be in a position to service the debt, the results have proved that there is a significant amount of cash on the balance sheet,” says a source close to the business.But investors in Countrywide debt are unlikely to be reassured by deteriorating sales in the first half of November.Equally, Bridgepoint says revenues are continuing to grow at Fat Face compared with the year-ago period in spite of a difficult month in June when poor weather hit sales. Its profits are expected to rise by at least 10 per cent in the year to March 2008, the company said, denying rumours to the contrary.Other leveraged loans trading at a discount include Crest Nicholson, the UK house-builder owned by HBOS and Sir Tom Hunter; and Nybron Flooring, the Swiss maker of parquet floors bought by Vestar, which is now in talks to renegotiate its debt.Some LBO debt in the market, such as Countrywide’s bonds, give companies breathing room, by including “toggles” that allow borrowers to take interest payment holidays, or “mulligans” forgiving missed debt repayments.While these borrower-friendly innovations make a default less likely in the short term, many debt investors fear they may just be storing up trouble for later.Some investors are selling debt that features these innovations to avoid being trapped in a “walking dead” situation when a lender would normally be forced to renegotiate its debt but creditors have no means of bringing it to the table.Another leading distressed debt investor predicts there will be a rise in default rates of private equity-owned companies, which have been at record lows for several years. But this investor says many of the companies with debt trading at big discounts are suffering from “investors just selling out of everything irrationally”.According to data from S&P LCD, the market information service, the average price bid for European loans in the secondary market hit a floor at less than 96 per cent of face value at the end of August and then recovered to about 98.25 per cent.But in October, the European market followed the US into another sharp decline with average prices now back closer to 97.25.There are several reasons for the fall-off, according to people in the market.Part of it might simply be the impending end of the year and the general slowdown in dealing that can often accompany the last weeks as investors and bank traders shy away from risking the profits and bonuses they might have made by making new bets.Plenty of institutional investors also have made most of the allocations for the year that they can and will only come to life again once next year’s funds are released.But the most significant reason is the weight of underwritten leveraged loans in the pipeline that banks still have to sell and the fear that some might be tempted or even forced to begin dumping holdings on the market.Europe still has about $100bn (£48.9bn) worth of deals waiting to be sold off – including the jumbo £9bn Alliance Boots debt.The banks in that deal have maintained in public that they are comfortable with the company’s creditworthiness and none will break ranks on selling the debt until at least the first quarter of next year.But others say this stance is misguided.“There are banks in Europe sitting on positions and saying ‘we are comfortable with the credit’, but that is not the point,” says one leveraged loan banker. “The point is do you want all that capital tied up in billions and billions [of euros worth] of long positions.”One of the biggest problems for European and UK loans is that so much business in recent years has been so-called “retreads”.“It is the same companies coming back to market again and again with higher leverage and higher earnings projections to pay as a new owner comes in or the current one takes out a dividend,” says Ed Eyerman, head of leveraged loans at Fitch Ratings.This has pumped leverage levels ever higher aided by the strong supply of cheap money mainly from complex investment vehicles over the past couple of years.Mr Eyerman estimates that new deals in 2008 will be lucky to see net debt to ebitda leverage of more than five times. The average for single-B-rated deals in the market is getting on for 6.5 times and on current repayment rates it will take until 2012 before those companies cut leverage down to the new market level.“This means private equity will be holding companies for longer and getting back to the business of actually trying to run businesses rather than just looking for the exit,” Mr Eyerman adds."
348;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Rake to monitor private equity compliance;;Sir Michael Rake, chairman of BT Group, has taken responsibility for monitoring how well private equity complies with the UK’s new code of conduct for transparency at buy-out firms, which is to be unveiled on Tuesday.The British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association announced on Monday that Sir Michael would chair a five-person monitoring group, overseeing compliance with the code, much as the Takeover Panel does for acquisitions.The group will have two members from the private equity industry and two from outside the industry. Its chairman will always be independent. The code will be unveiled on Tuesday by Sir David Walker, the City banker and former regulator.Sir Michael was named BT chairman at the beginning of this month. But his background is as an accountant, after working for 35 years at KPMG, most recently as international chairman of the Big Four network.Ensuring that buy-out groups comply with the code could be a challenge, especially as it has provoked opposition from some, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts of the US, which bought the Alliance Boots pharmacy chain for £11bn this year.Opponents complain the code will create an unwelcome burden for them while leaving others unaffected, such as Asian and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds.While KKR is expected to comply with the code, other US firms based in London could see the new transparency obligations as the final straw, after the government recently announced an increase in the base rate of capital gains tax they pay.The code is to be implemented on a “comply or explain” basis, allowing firms to opt out if they can give satisfactory explanation, such as fears it would put them at a competitive disadvantage against privately-owned rivals.
349;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-11-18T18:47:31Z;Private equity chief in warning on code;;The new head of Britain’s private equity trade body, the BVCA, warns on Monday that the industry is making a big sacrifice withTuesday’s publication of a voluntary code of conduct on transparency that risks driving some buy-out firms overseas.Trade unions argue that the code of conduct does not go far enough, but private equity firms complain it will create an unwelcome burden for them while leaving others unaffected, such as Asian and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds.Simon Walker, who became BVCA chief executive this month following a period of unprecedented public criticism of the industry, writes in Monday’s Financial Times: “Although I believe this is the right step, it is not going to be pain-free for private equity firms.”He argues that the code – drawn up by Sir David Walker, the City grandee – will see UK private equity-owned companies voluntarily renounce their long-held right to disclose information only to their shareholders and not to the wider public.“That is a major step both in principle and in practice,” said the BVCA chief. “In effect, what it means is that these private companies will be voluntarily renouncing a freedom – debated and reaffirmed only a year ago by parliament in the Companies Act 2006 – to limit their obligation to disclose to informing their own shareholders.“Understandably, many buy-out houses believe singling them out is discriminatory and will put them at a competitive disadvantage to individual investors such as Sir Philip Green and Sir Richard Branson or to sovereign wealth funds, to whom the new provisions will not apply.”The code has faced opposition from several large private equity firms, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts of the US, which bought the Alliance Boots pharmacy chain for £11bn this year. While KKR is expected to comply with the code, other US firms based in London could see the new transparency obligations as the final straw, after the government recently announced an increase in the base rate of capital gains tax they pay.Mr Walker told the FT that “there are many powerful reasons for being based in London, not least the infrastructure of legal and advisory support services”. He said: “I don’t think it will tip people over the edge, although these things are cumulative.”Regulatory and tax changes targeting private equity are under review in other countries, such as the US and Germany, so the UK might yet benefit, he said.“Nowhere in the world has the industry attempted anything comparable,” he writes. “Sir David’s plan is being greeted with some trepidation within the industry” even though most “recognise this is a necessary directional shift”. “We are going to have to keep the new regime under review.“It would be madness to devise a system that serves merely to drive private equity offshore into jurisdictions with lower standards of transparency and regulation than our own.”Chief with experience of a crisisSimon Walker, the head of the British private equity trade body, has a fight on his hands to ensure the industry embraces the voluntary code of conduct on transparency that is due out Tuesday.A newcomer to the world of buy-outs, Mr Walker was recruited from Reuters, where he was head of communications.The controversy over private equity in the UK reached fever pitch this year after buy-out groups launched bids for top household name companies, such as Alliance Boots and J Sainsbury.But if anyone is used to dealing with PR storms, it is Mr Walker. He was at Reuters during a painful restructuring, was spin-doctor for the Queen during the “Sophie tapes” media storm and worked at British Airway during the furore over its new tailfin designs.
350;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-11-14T23:13:57Z;Moore quits Friends Provident helm;;Philip Moore is leaving Friends Provident after less than a year as chief executive. His departure comes after the insurer failed to clinch a merger with Resolution Life, a rival.Sir Adrian Montague, the Friends chairman, will act as executive chairman until a replacement for Mr Moore is found. Sir Adrian and Jim Smart, finance director, have started a review of the insurer’s options, which they expect to put before investors by the end of January.Sir Adrian said on Wednesday: “It is right that we should take a hard look at the group’s strategy to ensure we are delivering the highest value available to our shareholders. The board has concluded this requires a change in the management team.”Mr Moore’s immediate departure came as little surprise to analysts and shareholders after what one investor described as “a year of flip-flopping”. The shares rose 8p to 167½p. Friends floated in 2001 at 225p.Mr Moore outlined ambitious profit growth targets for the life assurer at the start of the year that were abandoned three months later. Then in July he put forward a nil-premium merger with Resolution, having earlier said the businesses were incompatible. The rationale was that the merger would give Friends access to capital from Resolution’s so-called “zombie” insurance funds to balance the cash needed to build Friends’ new business in group pensions. The merger was scuppered by Hugh Osmond’s Pearl Group last month. Shareholders have stepped up pressure on the Friends board to address concerns about strategy, management and financial structure.Sir Adrian and Mr Smart will look at several options ranging from keeping the company as it is, selling the business or splitting it up. It could decide to sell assets such as Lombard, its European wealth manager, Friends Provident International or a 52 per cent stake in F&C Asset Management.Zurich Financial Services, JC Flowers, the US private equity group, and Axa, the French insurer, are all understood to have cast an eye over Friends this year.Mr Moore, aged 47, joined Friends in 2003 as finance director. He became chief executive after Keith Satchell, who spearheaded the group’s flotation in 2001, retired.Mr Smart, who joined Friends a year ago from Boots, is a possible candidate as chief executive, as is Clive Cowdery, chairman of Resolution, and Mike Biggs, Resolution’s chief executive. Friends has yet to say what Mr Moore’s pay-off will be. He is on 12 month’s notice and received a total package of £636,000 last year.
351;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Leveraged loans backlog;;Remember the leveraged loan backlog? Amid all the brow-beating over structured credit, the vast stockpile of plain old loans stuck in development hell has been almost forgotten. But that paper mountain is slowly shrinking – in the US, at least.The value of US deals awaiting syndication has almost halved since the summer to about $170bn, according to estimates from Standard & Poor’s LCD. Banks have employed various ruses to get loans away, including setting up new funds, run at arm’s length, to mop up the paper, and increasing coupon yields as much as they can under agreements with sponsors – normally by between 25 and 50 basis points. Chuck in a discount to par value and these loans can have a yield-to-maturity of as much as Libor plus 350-400 bps for the top slice of debt capital. That is about 150 bps more than before the credit crunch, even though risk, as measured by trailing default levels, is largely unchanged.Credit quality is still sound in Europe, too, but shifting the stuff is proving more difficult. The backlog, reckoned to be about $73bn, has barely moved since the summer. One difference is that Europe depended on structured credit funds such as collateralised loan obligations, which would take up to two-thirds of deals. They are now in retreat, unable to borrow cheaply. The remaining buyers, mostly banks, are balking at gross debt levels of more than six times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation – regardless of pricing. That leaves the really big sales – such as the £11.1bn Alliance Boots buy-out, with gross debt of more than nine times forecast ebitda – at the back of the queue.The fact that European lenders seem happier to sit on loans, rather than go through hoops to offload them, reflects the relatively small size of their exposure. But there are signs that US-style concessions are taking hold: BNP Paribas recently injected a thick tranche of junior mezzanine to reduce the leverage on the secondary buy-out of French firm Elis. If credit conditions fail to improve, banks’ efforts to get loans off their books may intensify.
352;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-11-12T07:36:51Z;St Pancras: Behold the cross-Channel cathedral;;There will be something uplifting, even on the most prosaic cross-Channel business trip, about travelling via Eurostar’s new, £800m (€1,136.20m, $1,663m) terminal at London’s St Pancras.The arching iron ribs of the station roof, designed by the Victorian engineer William Barlow who had helped design the Crystal Palace, lead the eyes inevitably upwards. Through the glass panels high above the platforms, on a clear day, passengers may glimpse a passing airliner and feel smug that today, at least, they will not be stuck in a holding pattern.Eighteen layers of paint were removed from those girders whose 240ft span, when the station opened in 1868, formed the largest enclosed space in the world. They have been repainted in a blue close to the colour said to have been demanded by the first stationmaster to remind passengers of the sky when cloud or darkness denied them the real thing.The cathedral simile is hackneyed but impossible to ignore. It is hard to imagine, in an age when the replacement bricks in the terminal walls had to be made of Leicestershire clay and fired in a specially built kiln in Derbyshire, to match the surviving originals, that the building might have been torn down in the 1960s.Travellers may now arrange to meet contacts who may be standing next to a bronze statue of the poet Sir John Betjeman, who led the movement to save it.Passengers travelling on domestic services will board and disembark in an extension of the station. But, perhaps as befits such an architectural celebration of railway expansion, platforms beneath Barlow’s refurbished roof will be used only by Eurostar, whose new line, despite not reaching as far north as campaigners for more high speed track would like, is nevertheless a significant milestone.If the purpose of the link and its new terminal is to lure even more customers from the airlines the company behind them – Eurostar’s parent London & Continental Railways – is not above copying airport technology. It says: “Instead of having the old-style departure board we will be providing airport-style plasma information screens and touch screens all around the terminal.” This does not extend to a moving walkway in the underground passage to nearby Euston Station, however, which is “too expensive to install and maintain”.Besides having its own station on the Thameslink route, the terminal will have direct access from the Piccadilly, Northern, Victoria, Metropolitan, Circle and Hammersmith and City underground lines. The ticket hall will be at street level, in an undercroft originally used to store beer transported from the Midlands. The platforms above rest on a forest of pillars, whose cast iron was hardened with horse urine.Travellers arriving at St Pancras International by taxi will be deposited a few metres from the fast-track business and security channel. LCR says checkpoints could cope with iris recognition, should it be demanded by the government.If they have time to spare they will be able to wait or work in a two-level business lounge, much bigger than that at Eurostar’s current Waterloo terminal. For those whose tickets do not allow access to the lounge, wi-fi internet access will be available anywhere in the terminal – and there will be internet stations in a business lounge at an internet cafe.Before boarding the train they will be able to indulge in a glass at what is claimed to be Europe’s longest champagne bar, measuring more than 90 metres. The bar will run by caterers Searcy’s, whose stable includes the restaurant – exclusively for tenants of the building and signed-up members – at the top of the Swiss Re Gherkin in the City.It is only a few feet from the platform edge, which has been lowered to afford drinkers a view of the train in its full glory, wheels and all.LCR says roughly half the planned retail and catering outlets will be ready to open on Thursday.Among those opening later will be the provisionally-named St Pancras Brasserie and bar, also to be operated by Searcy’s, which promises high-level cooking including breakfast – and private dining. Other eateries will include a gastro-pub, Carluccio’s and Yo Sushi.Among the shops will be a branch of Foyles the booksellers, Isle of Flowers, Marks & Spencer – food and clothing – Boots the chemist, Hamley’s for toys, and Thomas Pink and La Senza, respectively best known for men’s shirts and women’s lingerie. On some days there will be a farmers’ market.Although there is a four-star Novotel with 312 rooms and suites three minutes’ walk from the station, the surrounding area, in the process of a significant revitalisation, is not well-provided with mid- to top-of-the-range business hotels.That will change with the opening of a five-star Renaissance Marriott that will occupy part of the restored St Pancras Chambers.St Pancras Chambers will have come full circle. The building was designed as a hotel in the exuberant Gothic revival style of Sir George Gilbert Scott, whose other creations included the Albert Memorial. It opened in 1876 as the Midland Grand but closed in 1935 to become railway offices and was later abandoned.The Marriott will have an entrance on the Eurostar concourse, and will have about 244 rooms and suites, two restaurants, 20 meeting and function rooms and a health and leisure centre. It is scheduled to be ready in late 2009 but is more likely to open the following year.By then Eurostar’s most frequent business travellers will have passed through St Pancras International more times than they can remember. But some, at least, will surely still look up at that roof and marvel.
353;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-11-11T19:25:05Z;Walker tackles the public reticence of private equity;;The world of private equity has gone pretty quiet of late, but expect a renewed flurry shortly on the delicate topic of disclosure. The UK industry’s code of practice commissioned from the veteran banker Sir David Walker comes out on Tuesday week, and it could be interesting.This is not as parochial as it sounds. Europe’s biggest and most attention-grabbing buy-out has been KKR’s purchase of the retailer Alliance Boots. KKR is of course American – and has apparently signed up to Sir David’s proposals in advance.Nor is the thrust of the matter confined to private equity. As Sir David found with his earlier consultation document, there are two fundamental questions involved: the difference between public and private companies, and the relationship between shareholders and stakeholders.Begin with the fact that under law, a company owned by private equity is no different from any other private company – a family firm, say, or one owned by a sovereign wealth fund or an entrepreneur. So why is it singled out for special treatment?The answer surely lies in the taking private, during the peak of the boom, of large and prominent public companies. For the industry as a whole, this was a strategic blunder. Various interested parties, the press among them, resented going without information they had got used to, from the chief executive’s salary on down.Recall, though, why we know such things about public companies in the first place. Their shareholders are widely distributed, and so must be kept informed in an elaborate and public manner. Private company shareholders, who can sit round a table, have the same details – often more, since in the absence of traded shares there is no issue of inside information. But they keep it to themselves.That said, a resort to mere legality – as Sir David has pointed out – risks missing the point. The heads of large companies are, in the western world at any rate, the most powerful individuals not subject to popular vote. This raises the issue of legitimacy.Over the past few decades, privatisation has created many more such individuals. In the case of public companies, one response has been to demand more information – on executive pay, health and safety, the environment and so forth. Private equity, by withdrawing that information, threatens to put the process into reverse.The people who are cross about this are not of course the shareholders – who, as I said, are if anything better informed under private equity – but the other stakeholders. The mere mention of the word tends to make private equity executives cross-eyed with exasperation. But the more reflective ones take the point.After all, UK company law has always required private companies to lodge accounts with Companies House, on the obvious grounds that those doing business with the company – one set of stakeholders – should be clear on its financial standing.Indeed, last year’s updated Companies Act goes further, at least in setting out directors’ duties. They must, for instance, have regard to environmental impact, and maintain a reputation for high standards of business conduct.Disclosure is a different matter. The annual filing must now include a narrative business statement, setting out the company’s performance and the main risks and uncertainties. But the explicit purpose of that is to inform members of the company – that is, the shareholders – how well the directors have done their job. There is no obligation to disclose anything further to stakeholders.In the special case of private equity, advocates of disclosure have one or two more arguments. It is claimed, for instance, that because pension funds invest in private equity, the general public – who have their savings in pension funds – are entitled to details. But since pension funds are not in the habit of identifying the private equity firms they invest with, it is hard to see what use the public would make of this.Perhaps the private equity firms themselves should be obliged to identify their investors. So far at least, Sir David has ruled that out, other than by broad anonymous category. He has also ruled out disclosure of chief executive pay, or the profit share going to the fund’s managers, on the grounds that these are not matters of legitimate interest to stakeholders.In that sense, the code of conduct may turn out something of a damp squib. But in a small way, it opens the door to large issues. For instance, Sir David reportedly favours applying the code to big individual proprietors and even sovereign wealth funds.Getting the more reticent entrepreneurs to comply could be tricky. The Chinese government could be trickier again. But there are legitimate questions involved here. The present eclipse of private equity has robbed them of some of their urgency, but that does not mean they will go away.tony.jackson@ft.com
354;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-11-06T04:00:20Z;French offer way for buy-outs to beat censure;;City of London financiers are loath to admit they could learn anything from France, bar a few tips on fine wines and gourmet restaurants.Yet private equity bosses in France say their UK counterparts could have avoided the controversy suffered recently by London’s buy-out industry if they had copied a canny communications strategy from across the Channel.Eddie Misrahi, managing partner of the French office of Apax Partners and head of the AFIC private equity trade body, said the buy-out industry in France had been spared the worst of the controversy experienced in the UK because it had pre-empted the debate.“AFIC has realised for several years the necessity of statistics to educate and convince,” said Mr Misrahi. “We saw before the UK the need to release objective information.”His remarks come as Sir David Walker, a City grandee, is pushing the UK private equity trade body, the BVCA, to collect and publish more data on the industry’s economic and social impact as part of the code of conduct due out this month.AFIC produced a report on private equity’s impact on the economy in March, at the height of the French presidential election campaign, as politicians in Paris were turning on the capitalists and buy-outs were coming under fire in the UK.The report, produced by Constantin auditors, said jobs grew 4.1 per cent at French private equity-owned companies, against a national average of 0.7 per cent. Sales growth and salaries were higher under private equity ownership, and accidents at work were lower.“This report was irrefutable proof and it killed the debate,” said Mr Misrahi. “There were attempts to make it an electoral issue, but they failed.”Patrick Sayer, chief executive of the listed French buy-out house Eurazeo and Mr Misrahi’s predecessor as head of AFIC, said the findings could not be attacked by unions for being biased as “we did not pay for the survey, only sponsored it”. The report received some positive coverage in most French media, even in the communist daily L’Humanité, he added.Buy-out firms also used the country’s natural protectionist instincts to their advantage, arguing that foreign takeovers, such as the acquisition of Arcelor steel group by India’s Lakshmi Mittal, might have been averted if private equity had owned Arcelor, Mr Sayer said.“We have explained that if private equity and activist investors had been invested in it, Arcelor-Mittal would not have happened, or at least it would have been more expensive for Mittal,” he explained.To avoid a protectionist backlash, most big foreign buy-out firms use a local partner, as in the takeover of Legrand, the electrical equipment maker bought by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts of the US and Wendel of France.However, Mr Misrahi conceded that the conditions in France, Europe’s second biggest private equity market behind the UK, meant public backlashes were less likely to be provoked.“We have a tax system that is more reasonable, so there has been less controversy on that issue,” he said. France taxes capital gains at 16 per cent, but on top of that are social charges pushing the total rate up to 27 per cent – one of the highest in Europe.He said that private equity was less developed in France, representing just 0.3 per cent of GDP, against close to 1.2 per cent in the UK. “The first priority is to channel more funds into French private equity to help investment here,” he said.
355;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-11-05T13:20:41Z;Sainsbury bid falls through;;Playing hard to get has its perils. Delta Two, the state-owned Qatari investment fund, walked away from its drawn-out pursuit of J. Sainsbury, the UK supermarket chain. Its indicative 603p-a-share offer, including a 3p dividend, always seemed very stretched and now looks even more so, given credit market conditions. The debt refinancing difficulties faced by the leveraged buyers of BAA and Alliance Boots, for example, also offered discouraging precedents.Delta Two says it will retain its 25 per cent stake in Sainsbury. Other bidders are unlikely to emerge – domestic food retailers face insuperable competition hurdles, while overseas rivals, such as Carrefour, prefer to concentrate on less hostile environments than the UK.This lack of interest highlights Sainsbury’s unenviable position. A year ago, when its share price was 400p, it had one big strategic shareholder bloc in the form of the Sainsbury family. It now has three – Delta Two, the Sainsburys with 18.5 per cent and Robert Tchenguiz with another 10 per cent – all with differing views on its strategic direction. Valuations of Sainsbury have long factored in a bid premium and a more aggressive use of its £8.6bn property portfolio, but on a standalone basis, fair value estimates range from 440p to 528p a share. The share price fall from 555p to 440p leaves Sainsbury on a 17 per cent price to forward earnings premium to Tesco, its more efficient rival. This looks unsustainable.Everyone has lost out from this game of chicken. The Sainsbury board, which would have welcomed a 603p offer, appears at the mercy of its strategic shareholders. In turn, given the share price fall, the Sainsbury family may well come to regret the spoiling role it played. Meanwhile, the Qataris look at best indecisive and at worst irresponsible. The main losers, though, are Sainsbury’s long-suffering institutional and retail shareholders.
356;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-10-18T23:03:58Z;Reynolds joins list of Tesco leavers;;"Tesco has suffered another defection with the loss of Julia Reynolds, one of the founders of the Florence and Fred clothing range, to Figleaves.com, the lingerie retailer.Ms Reynolds is to become chief executive of the fast-growing online retailer after turning her back on the country’s biggest retailer. She was director of Tesco’s central European clothing business and worked at the company for nine years.“It gets me a bit out of the shadow of the senior management at Tesco and lets me paddle my own canoe a bit,” she said. Her defection comes on the heels of Dido Harding’s defection this month to J Sainsbury as director of convenience stores.Tesco said any suggestion it was part of a brain drain was “absolute nonsense”. “We have lots of homegrown talent throughout the business,” the company said, adding that recent defections showed “how much people throughout retail respect Tesco”.Ms Reynolds is not as senior as Ms Harding, who was one of a Tesco’s 60 most senior executives and was part of an elite earmarked for the board. However, she is the second Tesco executive to quit to become chief executive of another retail outfit in recent months, following John Browett’s defection to DSG International.Many retailer observers argue that Tesco’s success makes it the ideal training ground for a next generation of retail leaders, as Asda was in the 1990s under Allan Leighton and Archie Norman.The Asda generation went on to run some of Britain’s biggest companies, with Justin King at J Sainsbury, Andy Hornby at HBOS and Richard Baker at Alliance Boots, prior to this year’s private equity takeover.Other high profile defections include Scott Wheway to Alliance Boots as head of retail operations (he also left following the takeover); Ken McMeikan to Sainsbury as retail director; Darren Blackhurst to Asda as food trading director and Colin Smith to Somerfield as trading director.Tesco has played down fears of a braindrain, but ambitious executives could be frustrated. Five of the seven board directors have been in place for nearly a decade. And Sir Terry Leahy shows no signs of retiring until he has seen through a high-profile US move."
357;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-10-12T08:34:49Z;Private equity: Coming out of the shadows;;An increasingly prominent part of the business news agenda has been the lack of reporting by private equity companies. Having quietly gone about their business of acquiring sluggish industrial companies, they were surprised by the hostile reaction of the public when they started moving in on household name companies.”When they were buying and restructuring reasonably large businesses in relatively unattractive parts of industry, although it was important locally, there was no national media profile,” says John Cole, a partner at Ernst & Young. ”If you buy Boots or Sainsburys, the national press sees it as a story.”Mr Cole says that the moment private equity firms started moving into high profile businesses with high impact on the consumer they were inevitably going to receive more attention. ”They should have seen that coming,” he says. ”If you go around buying large chunks of the economy you cannot expect not to get attention, therefore you have to do something whether you like it or not.”The response from the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association was to commission Sir David Walker to review reporting requirements. His consultation document, ”Disclosure and Transparency in Private Equity”, was issued in July 2007. It proposed voluntarily reporting to an enhanced standard by those companies in which private equity companies invest, known as ”portfolio companies”, that were formerly FTSE-listed or whose size is over an agreed threshold.There is general acceptance that the limited partners in the private equity funds are well-informed about the performance of the companies in which their fund has invested. However, for the benefit of other stakeholders, Sir David proposed that general partners should publish an annual review, ”which should become an important channel of communication on the values that inform their approach to business and the governance of their portfolio companies”.Whereas the reporting requirements themselves are relatively uncontroversial, Sir David questions the prospective imbalance in reporting obligations as between portfolio companies and other large privately owned companies. There is an argument that all large companies should report to their stakeholders on the same basis, irrespective of their ownership. ”I don’t see the logic for picking one class of shareholder from another,” says Mr Cole. ”A small portfolio retail chain will have to publish more information than [retailer] Sir Philip Green, who owns half the high street. Where is the greater public interest?”If size determines the public interest, Mr Cole believes that reporting requirements should apply whoever owns the business. Foreign-owned companies, for example, have more influence on the UK economy than portfolio companies. Sir David hopes that his approach may be seen as a benchmark for other large private companies.However, David Pitt-Watson, a director of Hermes, the fund manager, points out that whereas private companies are owned by one person or a tight group, it is the public who finance private equity transactions through their pension funds. As co-author of The New Capitalists: How citizen investors are reshaping the corporate agenda, he points out that there are 10m-15m people in the UK whose money is ultimately invested in portfolio companies. This creates a degree of legitimacy in the demands for reporting on the same basis as quoted companies, which have a similar ultimate ownership structure.”We believe that there is a question mark over the isolation of private equity, as opposed to other types of privately-owned businesses,” says Emma Thorpe, director of European communications at Carlyle Group, the private equity firm. ”We feel that similar investors should comply with the same requirements, for example sovereign wealth funds and owners of privately-owned businesses that employ leverage and do buy-outs. Otherwise, the code is unnecessarily discriminatory towards private equity.” Carlyle Group believes that part of the solution to the ”unlevel playing field” is for competitive disadvantage to be viewed as a valid reason to ”explain” rather than ”comply” with the disclosure requirements.”If private equity portfolio companies are put at a disadvantage because they are competing directly with other businesses not subject to the code,” adds Ms Thorpe, ”they should be able to explain why they cannot comply.”The Trades Union Congress represents one stakeholder group for whom enhanced disclosure appeals. Janet Williamson, the organisation’s senior policy officer, explains that employees in listed companies can have an acceptable relationship with management that recognises their trade unions and which provide enough information so that employees feel they know what is going on in the company.”Too often when a company is bought out by a private equity fund, the relationship is suddenly broken off, leaving the union and employees in the dark,” she says. ”If a company has been listed, suddenly the amount of disclosure required by a private company is very significantly less and it is too big a jump. We want more reporting by portfolio companies, so that employees and their representatives can have a greater idea of what is going on in their company and its future plans.”The Walker Review does not recommend any change in existing regulatory or legislative provisions on disclosure. David Phillips, senior corporate reporting partner at PwC, does not think there is any appetite within government either. ”I don’t think there is any purpose,” he says, ”because when reporting becomes too prescriptive and too ’box ticking’ it loses its value.”Clearly, the most important objective in enhanced reporting is to meet the needs of stakeholders without putting portfolio companies at a commercial disadvantage. Mr Cole points out that balance is needed because the private equity model is very powerful.”If you talk to non-executive directors who have served on the board of both quoted and portfolio companies, they like the private equity way of running a business,” he says. ”They regard as a great strength the board’s ability to focus single-mindedly on clear objectives, unencumbered by the confusion of interests that you get in public companies. The more you open yourself up for scrutiny, the more external parties start to take an interest in how the business is run and the less powerful the private equity model becomes.”The purpose of enhanced reporting is to build trust in the private equity model and reassure stakeholders and the wider public that there is no public interest issue when iconic listed companies become portfolio companies.”There are perceptions around asset stripping, excessive leverage and staff not being treated as equitably,” says Mr Phillips, ”whether they are realities or perceptions. We live in a world where perceptions often run ahead of reality and you have to deal with them.””We support the move to more transparency,” says Ms Thorpe. ”Both because we have started doing larger transactions that touch the lives of a wider group of people and because we feel the industry has a good story to tell.”
358;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-10-12T08:34:49Z;Pensions: Reporting longevity;;In navigation, there is the one-in-60 rule, which states that if you fly one degree off your plotted course, after 60 miles, you will be one mile adrift of your intended position. Philip Broadley, a keen pilot and chief financial officer of Prudential, uses the rule to illustrate the problem of valuing pensions. ”To be able to navigate to within one degree using just a map and a compass is skilful,” he says. ”With pensions, trying to predict some sort of precise course for how your liabilities are going to extend out works in the same way – you can’t navigate precisely the further out you go so there will be some drift.”Pensions have rarely been out of the headlines in recent years. Issues have ranged from the dramatic shift away from defined benefit to defined contribution plans and the abolition of tax credit for funds, to the upheaval caused when accounting changes resulted in wild swings in stated surpluses and deficits. On top of this are the perennial problems associated with choosing the right assumptions when attempting to value liabilities that stretch into decades, which become increasingly hard to measure with any accuracy the further away they are. ”You almost want to say whatever this number turns out to really be in 30 years time, I can almost guarantee you it won’t be the one in front of you now,” says one finance executive.In November 2000, the UK Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17, which would bring pensions, surplus or deficit, fully on to company balance sheets. Given the timing – as the stock market began its long post-dotcom tumble – the notion of huge deficits really began to hit investors’ radar screens.By August 2003, one firm of actuaries calculated that the deficits among the FTSE 100 schemes were so large that stock markets would need a 50 per cent jump over the next year to wipe out the gap. Companies started increasing their contributions to fill the holes, but with the FTSE 100 deficit at over £85bn that year, progress was limited. By this summer, FTSE 100 schemes were registering a slight surplus for the first time, according to the annual survey by Lane, Clark and Peacock, the actuaries.Essentially, by bringing the liabilities on to the balance sheet, accounting standard setters made it clear that they were to be considered as debt. Investors needed to know the scale of the liabilities to gauge a company’s value and the risks it faced. The issues since then have been mostly of what information – and how much of it – is needed in corporate reporting to help investors understand the implications of pensions on the business.One of the most discussed factors has been longevity risk, or the danger that we are all living longer. ”When I started in this sector, life expectancy was maybe to your early 80s,” says Brian Peters, partner in PwC’s pensions business. ”Now it is my late 80s – in the space of 15 years, my life expectancy is up by between 5 and 10 per cent. The costs of that are immense.”Peter Elwin, head of accounting and valuation research at Cazenove, believes longevity assumptions will have to rise further. ”Companies have under-reserved in the past for longevity increases, though it is hard to spot exactly which ones have done this,” he says. ”As rules change, which encourages pension trustees and actuaries to use more conservative assumptions, we’re only going to see liabilities increase.”For investors trying to figure out how companies come to value their pension liabilities, longevity assumptions are a key part of the puzzle but are usually incomplete. Even if companies state a life expectancy, they can legitimately use different numbers depending on their workforce. Moreover, the number is a crude reckoning because it is based on a complicated cumulative probability calculation. ”Taking that and boiling it down to one number is really a shortcut,” says Mr Elwin. ”I’d rather have it than not, since it is a starting point for asking questions, but that is all it is.”In addition to how long we will live, there has been increasing attention on a different form of valuation – the buy-out, or discontinuance, liability. This is the price at which the company could offload the entire scheme and all its liabilities to someone else, usually an insurance company. The trustees calculate the liabilities of the fund and then figure out how these are to be hedged or covered. The cover consists of the existing assets, their expected returns, the agreed future contributions and the expected returns on them, plus the unfunded corporate covenant assumed by most trustees. This last issue is the issue that trustees think might need to be covered, but they plan to leave asking the company until the additional amount becomes clearer. In effect, the agreed future contributions and the expected returns are also part of the covenant since trustees assume the company will make good on its obligations.The result of all this is a value far higher – perhaps as much as 30 per cent more – than decreed by the 2005 international financial reporting standards through IAS 19. The buy-out liability is not a number any company has to disclose, but it is the one on which trustees are basing their calculations.The implications of this became apparent in June, when KKR, the private equity group, was forced to reach a deal with the Boots pension scheme when the plan’s trustees threatened to use their position as the retailer’s largest creditor to derail KKR’s planned takeover. The private equity agreed to increase its cash payment to the fund to meet the £305m shortfall the trustees claimed and also provided additional security to the value of £600m.The market for pure buy-outs is hotting up. Long dominated by Legal & General and Prudential, who traditionally wound up the schemes and replaced them with annuities, there are now players looking to maintain the funds and run them more efficiently. Last month, Pension Corporation bid for Telent, the rump of former telecoms giant Marconi, with the aim of selling the business and keeping the pension fund. This summer, Citigroup entered the market, buying the £200m closed scheme of Thomson Regional Newspapers.However, a buy-out value might be of limited use for the biggest schemes. ”The market is relatively small and I think for many of us the more accurate answer would be to say we don’t know,” says Mr Broadley. ”No scheme of our size has gone through this – it is not a solution really available to us. ”The buy-out liability is saying if you want to transfer liabilities to a willing buyer, what would the price be. For a lot of schemes in the FTSE 100, it is beyond the ability of any single insurance company to take these on.”Mr Elwin contends the number can still have value. ”It is true there isn’t an insurance company on the planet that would find it easy to swallow the biggest funds, but if the trustees are basing their calculations on this, it is a very important number to know,” he says.It seems even though stock market gains and higher bond yields have brought Britain’s pension schemes back into surplus – at least on a current accounting basis – it doesn’t mean there is any end in sight for the ever-growing size of the liabilities.
359;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-10-09T20:29:30Z;Call to buy-out firms on code scrutiny;;"Sir David Walker has called for the private equity trade body to establish an “independent process” for reviewing and monitoring conformity with the industry code of conduct he is preparing to publish on November 20.The announcement is the first indication of how Sir David will address questions about whether the scrutiny of the media and trade unions will be enough to ensure his code of conduct is widely adopted or largely ignored by buy-out firms.The former City of London banker and regulator has said he would like to see established an “independent board of trustees” along the lines of the Takeover Panel, the City’s self-regulating authority for mergers and acquisitions.Sir David said on Teusday he would recommend to the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association that it established “an independent process for review of the guidelines and for appropriate monitoring of conformity with them”.The guidelines will be enforced by the BVCA on a comply or explain basis. Sir David said he would recommend the trade body started “a significantly increased data collection, analysis and reporting role on behalf of the industry”.Buy-out titans are expected broadly to welcome Sir David’s code and some of the bigger groups, such as Permira, are preparing an annual review to comply with its disclosure recommendations.However, top executives are expected to push back in some areas. One worry is that the code will not cover other private investors, such as foreign sovereign wealth funds, wealthy entrepreneurs or private companies.Industry executives argue this is unfair, forcing them to comply with more stringent disclosure standards, while others that they compete with for deals are unaffected, such as the Tchenguiz brothers, the property tycoons, or Delta Two, the Qatari fund bidding for J Sainsbury.Another concern is that by forcing private equity firms to disclose more about the performance of their investment company, they will become more sensitive to short-term performance, affecting their ability to invest for the long term.Furthermore, buy-out bosses say there is not a fixed standard for reporting the performance of unrealised investments, leaving scope for each private equity fund to report its performance in different ways.His preliminary report recommended the code of conduct apply only to private equity firms that acquired portfolio companies above a certain size – equivalent to the FTSE 250 index, with an equity stake of £300m or more, employing at least 1,000 staff or having an enterprise value above £500m.The main disclosure requirements for portfolio companies would be: to file annual reports four months after the year-end; to report in detail on the composition of the board; and to outline the fund’s values and approach to its reputation.The companies would have to give information on the level, structure and conditionality of debt and produce a shorter interim report two months after the mid-year.Industry under pressurePrivate equity has been on the defensive since trade unions – notably the GMB – launched a campaign against them last year over the sacking of workers at Birds Eye, the frozen foods company, and the AA motor breakdown services group, writes Martin Arnold.Private equity bids for J Sainsbury and Alliance Boots, the high street retailers, added fuel to the fire. The issue of taxation surged to the top of the political agenda this summer after a veteran private equity dealmaker admitted it was indefensible that buy-out bosses could pay less tax than their cleaners.Coming just as leading buy-out titans were being dragged before the Commons’ Treasury select committee inquiry into the industry in June, the furore over tax prompted calls from unions, the media and opposition politicians for change to the tax system.When Gordon Brown, prime minister, was asked about the issue at the Labour conference in Bournemouth last month, he promised to close any “loopholes” that allowed private equity executives to get away with paying less tax."
360;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-10-05T03:02:04Z;Trouble ahead for overheated equity market;;The UK private equity market showed clear signs of overheating this year as debt levels surged to new highs in bigger leveraged buy-outs, suggesting trouble ahead for banks and buy-out firms after this summer’s credit squeeze.Debt levels on LBOs worth at least £100m rose to 10.7 times earnings before interest and tax this year, against 9.1 times last year, according to research by the Centre for Management Buy-out Research (CMBOR). It is the first time such leverage ratios have risen above 10 for at least two decades.On smaller deals valued at £10m-£100m, leverage levels were 5.2 times ebit, compared with the 6.8 ratio reached in 2005. On deals worth less than £10m, the average debt-ebit proportion was 2.2.The credit squeeze has made lenders more cautious. But the evidence of ballooning leverage levels in the run-up to the credit crunch suggests there could be difficulties ahead for buy-out firms when they look to sell or refinance those companies and for the banks that agreed the loans.Marc Pacitti, a partner at Deloitte, said: “Definitely the bigger deals have overheated, while the small-to-mid-market remains fairly stable.”CMBOR found that 160 LBOs were completed during the third quarter in the UK, worth a total of £14.9bn. That represents a slight slowdown from the record 178 deals, worth £19.7bn, completed in the second quarter.But Mr Pacitti said the high level of third-quarter LBO deals – the second highest on record – reflected activity before the credit crunch took hold at the start of August, such as the buy-out of EMI and the merger of Saga and the AA. He predicted the fourth quarter would be much lower. “We genuinely think it will fall off a cliff in the fourth quarter. I think we will see very few plus-£500m deals being done,” he said.Tom Lamb, co-head of Barclays private equity, said: “For the larger buy-out market the situation looks difficult …I do not expect there to be many £1 billion deals announced until we are well into 2008.”Standard & Poor’s on Thursday cut its credit rating for Alliance Boots, the pharmacy chain acquired this year by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for £11bn, by three notches from BB-minus to B-minus.The rating agency said Boots had a ratio of debt to earnings, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of about 10 and ebitda interest cover of about 1.3. It also withdrew its rating, saying Boots had refused to provide sufficient information.
361;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-10-02T22:46:55Z;A wait before new CLO deals emerge;;Investors in the leveraged loan markets are beginning to see some promising signs of improvement in demand and trading but there is no over-excitement yet.Many forecast it will be only at the end of the first quarter next year or into the second that issuance of loans themselves and the complex vehicles that account for a good proportion of loan demand will return to anything like normal levels.The market for new large leveraged loan deals has been all but shut down since the failure of banks to sell debt linked to the private equity-backed buy-outs of Alliance Boots in Europe and Chrysler in the US in late July.This market has received a boost from the surprising level of demand seen for $8bn of loans sold last week by First Data, which was bought for $26bn by KKR.However, banks in the US and Europe still hold in the region of $350bn of unsold buy-out debt, cramping their desire to fund new deals.A big part of the problem for the loan market has been that demand for collateralised loan obligations – which pool together loan investments and raise funding in the capital markets – atrophied as investors backed away from all kinds of structured products.New issuance of CLOs has tumbled in recent months with only a handful of deals done in July and August and almost none in September.Spreads or risk premiums on the debt sold to finance CLOs have soared.According to Deutsche Bank research, a typical top-ranked AAA slice has seen spreads leap from about 22 basis points in early July to about 75bp now.“The bid for CLO paper has begun to improve but there is still very little liquidity and, at current spread levels, the arbitrage for new deals doesn’t really make sense,” one CLO manager says.A few deals from the bigger, more established managers or those with strong bank backing can be expected before the year’s end, investors and managers say, but it will take some time for the investment banks that provide funding for the preparation, or warehousing, stage of new CLOs to open for business again.
362;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-09-17T17:18:55Z;CBI seeks rewrite of doctors’ contracts;;The CBI employers’ organisation on Monday called for a rewrite of the UK family doctors’ contract to give patients more convenient access to GPs and to make it easier for the private sector to provide alternatives to existing primary care services.Its call came as Alan Johnson, the health secretary, and Lord Darzi, the junior health minister, were to launch on Tuesday the second part of consultation with patients and staff on how NHS services need to improve – including how access to primary care can be improved.Lord Darzi, who is professor of surgery at Imperial College, London, is also to hold a conference next month on the issue, bringing in the royal colleges and GPs, but also potential and actual private providers of primary care from the pharmacy chains Boots and Lloyds, to the Virgin Group, Care UK, Netcare and others.Mr Johnson has signalled his desire to see family doctors have longer opening hours, without yet specifying the mechanism by which he hopes to achieve that.The CBI on Monday said patients should be able to register with more than one GP – for example one near work, one at home. The minimum income guarantee that GP practices received, which made it harder for private providers to enter the NHS market, should be “reviewed”, the CBI said, and geographic lists of patients, which the CBI said in effect made the local GP a monopoly provider, should go.The British Medical Association responded by accusing the CBI of “denigrating” general practice.The employers’ organisation said a “fundamental rethink” of the GP service was needed, with 10m adults complaining they could not book an appointment more than 48 hours in advance.The CBI said 3.5m working days were lost from time spent going to the doctor’s at a cost to the economy of about £1bn a year.John Cridland, the CBI’s deputy-director general, said: “In the 21st century it should be possible to have a doctor close and close to home so that we can all get on with our lives with minimum disruption.“Where provision of family doctor services is not meeting people’s needs, or in those areas where there are too few doctors, new providers should be brought in.”Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the BMA’s family doctors’ committee, said the CBI “should put their own house in order” before blaming general practice.Many employers demanded unnecessary sick notes from employees for temporary illnesses, he said, an “abuse of the system that is a waste of the time of both working people and clinicians”.Better occupational health services would also help, Dr Buckman said, suggesting that the CBI’s real agenda was “privatisation” of the health service.
363;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-09-13T17:45:19Z;Vallourec leads Europe higher;;"There was pain for Alcatel-Lucent shareholders as the Franco-American company issued its third outlook warning this year on Thursday.The company said it now expected 2007 revenue growth to be flat, at constant exchange rates. It had previously expected growth of about 5 per cent.Alcatel said it had seen a “change in capital spending” by North American customers this year, meaning volumes had failed to make up for “ongoing price pressure”.Standard & Poor’s downgraded Alcatel-Lucent from “buy” to “hold” and cut its estimates for 2007 and 2008.“The decision to fight on all fronts for market position has, we believe, not resulted in market share conservation,” said S&P analyst Clara Van der Elst.“As such, we worry about the company’s product line-up and strategy. We do not expect near-term positive news flow.”Alcatel’s warning came in stark contrast to Swedish rival Ericsson, up 0.5 per cent to SKr26.42. It predicted this week demand would be strong in the third-quarter.Alcatel-Lucent’s shares – which were trading at more than €8 just ten days ago – ended the day at €6.62, down 8.7 per cent. They have plunged nearly 40 per cent since the start of 2007.WestLB said it still did not regard the weakness as a buying opportunity. “We would not upgrade our recommendation unless the stock were to reach €6,” said analyst Thomas Langer.But the broader equity market enjoyed another positive session as takeover optimism was boosted by reports that some financing for the buy-out of Alliance Boots of the UK had gone through.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 14.08 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 1,524.35.Merger and acquisition hopes also helped lift some individual stocks.Vallourec, the specialist steel tubing maker, jumped 4.8 per cent to €191.26 as rumours of a possible bid from Russia refused to die down.Gazprom has frequently been cited as a possible buyer, with some traders suggesting a bid of up to €280 a share might be on the cards. Gazprom said yesterday it had no interest in acquiring the company. Lukoil is also believed to be on the lookout for
acquisitions.Vocento, the Spanish media group, climbed 5.9 per cent to €16.08 after reports that businessman Jaime Castellanos was preparing a bid.Meanwhile, ArcelorMittal climbed 4.6 per cent to €48.20 after the steelmaker unveiled plans to buy back a further 27m of its own shares, on top of a $590m stock repurchase it has just completed.Like M&A activity, share buybacks provided strong support to equities up until the recent bout of market turbulence.Semiconductor stocks remained under pressure following disappointing guidance from US peer Texas Instruments.However, Lehman Brothers yesterday upgraded its stance on the European sector from “neutral” to “positive”, based on expectations of a strengthening recovery.Lehman upgraded Germany’s Infineon from “equal-weight” to “overweight”, and raised its price target from €12.20 to €16.“We expect Infineon shares to outperform on additional gains in wireless and the gradual move away from dynamic random access memory,” said Lanalyst Andrew Gardiner.But the broker reduced STMicroelectronics from “overweight” to “underweight” and lowered its target from €15 to €14. STMicro shares fell 3 per cent to €12.06 while Infineon eased 0.4 per cent to €11.98.ASML, the Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer, fell 2.3 per cent to €21.82."
364;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-09-07T18:55:24Z;Two UK banks left with loan pools of $20bn;;Two UK high-street banks are saddled with some of the largest pools of leveraged loans for pending European private equity deals, according to industry estimates.Barclays Capital and Royal Bank of Scotland have between them more than $20bn (£9.9bn) of loans still to syndicate, coming second only to Citigroup, which has almost $12bn.Royal Bank of Scotland is understood to have about $9.2bn of leveraged loans used to finance deals, including Tank & Rast, Travelex, USP Hospitales and Debitel. Barclays still has about $11.5bn on its books for deals which include Brakes Brothers, Applus and DSI.The market for leveraged loans ground to a halt over the summer as hedge fund investors abandoned the market and others balked at the pricing terms and leverage levels of deals that banks were trying to sell.The failure to sell jumbo finance packages for Alliance Boots and for Chrysler in the US in late July led to stock market falls as the premium priced in for potential private equity bids disappeared almost overnight.But according to sponsors more than 95 per cent of private equity portfolio assets are performing well, are ahead of budget and are de-levering.With groups such as Blackstone recently closing a new $21.7bn fund, financial sponsors believe the leveraged finance markets will reopen in the near term.Estimates put the total amount of leveraged loans from European deals outstanding at between €70bn (£47bn) and €75bn, or up to $97bn – significantly less than the more than $250bn pipeline of loans waiting to be sold from US deals.Dan Gardner, head of M&G’s European leverage loan fund, said the problem was fear of the unknown. “No one knows when the hanging bridges will clear,” he said.The banks declined to comment on their exposures.
365;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Rudd chooses the least comfortable chair in Britain;;The risk-taking part of a businessman’s career normally comes at the start. It is brave, therefore, for Sir Nigel Rudd, who could have exercised any number of options to chair another large publicly listed company, to take on the role of chief whipping boy at BAA, unarguably Britain’s most public private company.It is a smart hire by Ferrovial, owner of the beleaguered airports group, but how will it turn out for Sir Nigel? This is quite a different task from the chairmanship of Pilkington or Alliance Boots. The BAA chairman’s main dialogue will be with “stakeholders” – passengers, staff, airlines, and politicians – not with myriad investors. (No need for him to worry any more about the views of “stupid” analysts, at least.)But in one important regard, the job is identical to that of a PLC chairman: he will serve at the pleasure of the shareholder(s). For all the ceremony about Sir Nigel “succeeding” Rafael del Pino, Ferrovial’s president, as chairman, it is the Spaniard who will judge whether the pioneering board structure really works. Sacking Sir Nigel would be unthinkable – but BAA could always do with more hands on the X-ray machines at Heathrow.Slow cooking at SainsburyIn a world dominated until very recently by wham-bam takeover approaches, there is something almost admirable about the stately courtship of J. Sainsbury by Delta Two, the Qatari bid vehicle. Although there is an inevitable clamour for speed, following “positive” meetings this week between the two sides, there are plenty of reasons why it is slow going, of which market unpleasantness is only the most obvious.The Sainsbury directors know that once they open the books to the Qataris they will have taken an almost irreversible step. As a result, far more detail – not least on the financing of the bid – has to be settled in advance.It is almost two and a half years since Apax sent a shiver through British boardrooms by dropping its proposed offer for Woolworths after being allowed in for due diligence. The Sainsbury case is different. The Qataris hold 25 per cent of their target, so both sides would suffer if talks advanced to the next phase and were then cut short. One more reason for everyone to take care – and for Sainsbury not to rush the Qataris unless progress, however slow, finally stalls.Rightmove’s shark-baitHowever wide the assumption that you should hire a shark to sell your home on the basis that he will get the highest price, the truth is that estate agents are more excited about “churn” (selling more homes) than about landing the best offer.Obviously, they benefit from the fact that prices are so much higher than they were in the 1990s. But agents’ biggest fear for the next few years is – or should be – a drop-off in transactions rather than a fall in prices. When the housing market sagged between the winter of 2004 and the summer of 2005 and deal volumes slumped, prices kept rising, albeit modestly. Yet Countrywide, the UK’s largest chain of agents, laid off more than 500 agents in a thrift drive.Shareholders in Rightmove, the property website, must wonder whether its business model would also be hit by a similar downturn. Estate agents and developers pay a set monthly fee to Rightmove to advertise as many properties as they like. Would they dump this service if times got tougher?Five years ago, that was a valid fear. But now, with internet use firmly entrenched – and growing questions over the sustainability of local newspaper adverts – Rightmove looks more like a utility than a luxury. Agents may refuse to pay higher monthly fees. But they would be loath to abandon this powerful marketing tool, which is why a price-to-earnings ratio of 24 times forecast earnings for 2008, while steep, is not insane.The mug’s beautiful gameDoes stake-shuffling at Arsenal signal the start of the end-game? For minority shareholders, it is more like a mug’s game – no dividends, no perks, a board that largely disregards them – except that, according to Bloomberg, the shares have risen by nearly three quarters in the past year. Alisher Usmanov and his allies have now made clear that there isn’t much short-term value in the stock: according to advisers, they are not expecting a financial return from their 14.6 per cent holding. But neither the Usmanov route of heavy investment, fuelled by rights or bond issues, nor the board’s “business as usual” approach, offers much to disinterested investors. If there are any non-fans left, they must be sorely tempted to sell their illiquid holdings near the £8,250 high at which Mr Usmanov and Co bought their stake in the club and watch the rest of this game from the touchline.
366;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-08-31T16:36:59Z;Rudd takes over as BAA chairman;;Sir Nigel Rudd, one of the leading figures in British business, has agreed to become chairman of BAA, in a bold move by Ferrovial, the Spanish majority owner, to restore the UK airports group’s ailing fortunes.BAA has faced harsh criticism for the failing service standards of its three London airports – Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.Sir Nigel is to be joined on the BAA board by Lord Stevens, the former commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, as part of a radical shake-up by BAA’s owners, an international consortium led by Ferrovial, the Spanish conglomerate and including CDP, the Canadian pensions institution, and the private equity arm of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation.BAA’s relations with the UK regulators have become strained. The Civil Aviation Authority, the economic regulator, has proposed a lowering of the financial returns allowed to BAA, while the Competition Commission has launched an investigation into the structure of the group which could lead to a break-up of its London monopoly and the possible sell-off of one or more of the airports.Rafael del Pino, chairman of the majority family-owned Ferrovial, is stepping down from the chairmanship of BAA and is leaving the board, as is Joaquìn Ayuso, Ferrovial chief executive.Sir Nigel has been at the centre of some of the biggest UK business deals as chairman of Pilkington, Boots and Pendragon.He has gained a reputation as a leading turnround specialist and was the driving force in building up and later dismantling Williams Holdings.Sir Nigel is deputy chairman of Barclays Bank, where the chairman is Marcus Agius – who until last year was chairman of BAA and led the unsuccessful fight against the hostile takeover by the Ferrovial consortium.Lord Stevens was recently appointed prime minister Gordon Brown’s international security adviser. Security issues have been at the heart of the some of the most difficult problems facing UK airports and in particular Heathrow in the last 12 months.Sir Nigel said he turned down approaches to take over the chairmanship of three FTSE-100 companies before the BAA offer. “I have done everything else. I have built a business, I have done the buying and selling. But the airports are so important for the UK. It is a reputation thing. If I don’t turn it round, my reputation is tarnished. I don’t intend for that to happen.”
367;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-08-16T19:09:07Z;Buy-out firms still on the hunt for funds;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, PAI Partners and Carlyle Group are among more than 50 private-equity firms seeking to raise at least $52bn of European leveraged buy-out funds, as they shrug off recent difficulties in credit markets.Several auctions of large companies that were expected to attract bids from private equity have been postponed, such as Cadbury’s sale of its Schweppes business in the US and Virgin Media’s auction of itself.Yet while their activity has slowed, big buy-out firms seem more eager to raise fresh funds in anticipation of a considerable buying opportunity, as the credit market turmoil cuts the price of companies they buy.People close to several large private equity investors said that in spite of the credit market difficulties, appetite to invest in buy-out funds from longer-term investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, was increasing.KKR is seeking to raise at least €7.7bn ($10.3bn) for its new European buy-out fund. Its previous €4.5bn fund closed in 2005 and it has already spent much of that, even before the £11bn ($21.7bn) takeover of the Alliance Boots pharmacies chain.Carlyle aims to raise €5bn for its third European fund, while Lion Capital and Barclays Private Equity are looking to raise €2bn each. CVC Capital Partners is yet to finalise its fundraising documents but is expected to seek €10bn-€15bn this year.Nick Arnott, managing director of Private Equity Intelligence, which tracks buy-out fund performance, said: “They seem pretty confident, as some of the mega funds have been raising funds above their targets. Investors are still keen to increase their exposure to private equity.”Last week in the US, Blackstone closed the world’s largest private equity fund at $21.7bn and said it was already committed to spending two-thirds of the fund on deals, including the $26bn purchase of Hilton Hotels and the $18bn acquisition of Freescale Semiconductors.One adviser to pension funds said many were still below their allocation target for investing in private equity.If the slowdown in “mega buy-outs” continues for months, the adviser said investors could find they are investing less in private equity, as the funds they have already committed are drawn down more slowly.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
369;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-08-16T18:17:28Z;Belief persists in real economy;;"When Sentinel, a large American investment house, stopped investors from withdrawing their money this week, it cited market “panic”. No wonder: markets around the world gyrated dramatically in recent days, contributing to a growing sense of crisis in parts of the financial world.But what has been almost as remarkable as this month’s market turmoil is the reaction of economists: unlike their ­panic-stricken counterparts on bank trading floors, the pundits paid to analyse the “real” economy have been saying: “Crisis, what crisis?”Certainly, the current market turmoil originated with a “real” economic woe – the all-too-tangible problem of some financially stretched American households failing to make mortgage payments. But this summer it spawned a drama in esoteric and acronym-rich spheres such as the collateralised debt obligation (CDO) market, the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) world, or the sector of special investment vehicles (SIVs).The million – or trillion – dollar question now is whether the financial crisis will return to haunt the wider economy or whether it can be contained. Are these market troubles, in other words, unfolding in a parallel universe inhabited by over-excited bankers and hedge fund managers; or are we witnessing a “time-lag” problem, meaning that the damage from the financial crisis is very real but has yet to feed through to the “real” economy?Many of the financiers at the heart of the current storm argue – perhaps unsurprisingly – that the events are highly significant. For what is essentially occurring now is widespread ­“deleveraging” – the market term for when investors and financial institutions are forced to cut their debt in a hurry by selling assets.Financial history suggests that such deleveraging rarely occurs smoothly, or without having a knock-on effect on the wider economy. What makes this episode particularly unnerving are signs that the pain is spreading from hedge funds to banks. As George Magnus of UBS says: “Deleveraging may prove longer-lasting [than expected] and not confined to the US sub-prime mortgage market…Gloomier scenarios, including hard-landing risk, must be considered in the event that the ongoing financial malaise worsens and endures.”But most economists remain sanguine. After all, fundamental world growth prospects are strong, they say, and lower prices for risky assets could even make the economy more robust. Moreover, much of the market turmoil has erupted in financial spheres such as derivatives – which often appear to have a limited connection to the world of goods and services.David Miles, chief UK economist of Morgan Stanley, for example, likens the complex financial products that are central to the current malaise to bets on a horse race. These bets can add up to an impressive figure – but they do not affect the outcome or the strength of the horse.Similarly, he argues, in the real world it is the revenue-generating process of the economy in households and companies that matters, not the complex bets on this made between investors in sophisticated markets. Or, as Julian Jessop of Capital Economics puts it rather more directly: “People in financial markets always think they are more important than the real world.”Nevertheless, making a definitive judgment on the wider impact of the current turmoil is difficult, partly because the events unfolding in the financial sphere are highly complex – and still moving so quickly that policymakers often struggle to piece together what is going on.Two important facts exist. First, markets have been so calm in the past few years that the level of returns investors could earn on their assets was low. Consequently, many scrambled to find new ways of boosting these returns – and one easy strategy has been to assume more debt to buy assets, pushing up their values and increasing risk at the same time.Second, there has been a frenetic burst of financial innovation. This decade, bankers have created a plethora of new ways to slice and dice the types of risk that used to be held on banks’ balance sheets – and sell them on to new investors. The subprime mortgage market is a case in point: banks used to hold these loans on their balance sheets but in recent years have turned them into bonds and sold them to new investors – who typically then use them to create derivatives, which are then repackaged and resold, over and over again.Judging just how much indebtedness has been created as a result is hard, since many of these new-fangled instruments are relatively opaque. Worse still, the investors that have raised their leverage – such as hedge funds and SIVs – typically operate partly outside the realm of the regulated banking system.Nevertheless, what is clear amid this fog is that the unravelling of leverage now under way is brutal. For while the process started with a tangible and seemingly limited problem – namely defaults on US subprime loans – as funds have rushed to offload these assets, this has triggered waves of selling in other markets such as equities.Nobody expects to see this process end soon. “We see markets on a knife-edge for the near term,” admits Jan Loeys of JPMorgan. One reason is that there is now rising uncertainty about where the subprime losses actually lie. For the same process that created this decade’s financial exuberance – namely the ability to slice and dice risk – means that exposure to subprime losses is spread widely around.As a result, investors are now being confronted by a series of nasty shocks – or “small grenades”, as one policymaker calls them – as institutions keep unveiling more bad news. This process could last for some time, given that the institutions holding subprime debt employ a vast array of practices for measuring the value of their portfolios – which means many will only acknowledge their hits after a long delay.A second factor fuelling the unease is that there are now signs that problems are spreading from hedge funds and other small players to banks themselves. One link between the markets and the banks is via another key institution that has been purchasing complex securities linked to US mortgages: the so-called SIV or conduit, a vehicle that funds itself in the short-term money markets and thus does not appear on the banks’ balance sheets. However, many of these vehicles have arranged emergency credit lines with banks in case their normal funding sources dry up.The fear haunting the markets now is that the banks will soon be forced to bail out these vehicles, which could place bank balance sheets under huge strain. In fact, this has already occurred at one German bank, IKB, which triggered a near-implosion. “Credit market conditions are now analogous to a secondary banking crisis,” notes Tim Bond, an analyst at Barclays Capital. Stress on the banks might potentially force them to call in lines of credit to the real economy, cutting into growth, as has occurred in previous banking crises.Nevertheless, there are some reasons to be sceptical. A key point about the frenetic pace of financial innovation is that it is financial players – not mainstream companies – that have generally become highly levered. Thus, while interest rates have been low, the remarkable record of world economic growth over the past four years – the best run in over 30 years – has not been on the back of a corporate borrowing binge, fuelling investment in worthless assets.On the contrary, corporate debt in aggregate has been falling and balance sheets growing ever more healthy. As a result, the cost of borrowing for companies with stronger finances, and even for those with junk bond ratings, has generally been flat or even falling over the past month, irrespective of the turmoil (see chart). Similarly, creditworthy households have been enjoying a period of falling long-term interest rates, which is far from recessionary.The one area where growth has been fuelled by excess borrowing has been in US subprime mortgages. But the net economic losses are too small to put a big dent in US growth, let alone the global economy. The Federal Reserve, for example, currently estimates that net losses from subprime will be between $50bn (£25bn, €37bn) and $100bn. But Lehman Brothers points out that even losses of $200bn would be “far less in nominal terms than the half-trillion US savings and loans debacle of the mid-to-late 1980s”. It adds: “As a per cent of the world bond market, this is about five-tenths of one per cent; a large absolute number but small on a relative basis.”Indeed, policymakers may even ­welcome what is occurring. After all, central bankers around the world have repeatedly warned over the past year that markets were pricing risky credits too cheaply. Thus, as Jean Claude ­Trichet, the European Central bank president, pointed out this week, one upside of current events is “a normalisation of the pricing of risk”. Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, went further last week, calling the events “a more realistic pricing of risk, and that’s to be welcomed”.If credit does become more “normally” priced, this will benefit anybody who has not become over-levered in recent years. In the corporate world, for example, mainstream companies are now better able to compete against buy-out rivals. “Deleveraging an overleveraged system is always dangerous,” notes Credit Suisse. “[But] better to deleverage when in a strong economy than a weak one . . . when there are plenty of strong cash buyers waiting in the wings [and] when past over-investment is not threatening a profits bust.”However, the longer the turmoil lasts, the greater the potential risks to business and consumer sentiment – and the wider economy. If a serious crisis erupts at a bank, for example, that could dent confidence. Similarly, if creditworthy investors – companies with healthy balance sheets or consumers with unblemished credit histories – cannot borrow at reasonable rates, this may slow growth. But these remain for the moment just “ifs” – and there are no signs of it yet.A more tangible threat is that US households will now respond to the turmoil by raising their levels of saving in response to slower growth or even future falls in house prices. That could reduce US growth prospects and has been an economic risk, unrelated to the current credit market woes, for some time. Meanwhile, in the very near future, a prolonged period of deleveraging could hurt the financial services sector. Jobs and house prices in London and New York, for example, may yet be hit.But much depends on whether households and companies ignore the fear in capital markets as an obscure event with little bearing on their prosperity and prospects or whether they see this as a portent of harder times to come and hunker down. And it is these risks – not a desire to bail out the financial markets – that are giving central banks pause for thought. In Europe, the ECB is still likely to raise interest rates again, while the Bank of England looks as though it will now wait and see. In the US, the Fed is still more concerned about inflation than falling growth, implying that the markets are too certain about a cut in rates in September, but it would respond to evidence that prolonged troubles for borrowers was damaging the economy.But at the moment, the focus among policymakers remains on trying to smooth the necessary adjustment to a more deleveraged world in the markets – so that the badly needed repricing of risk can continue without wider disruption. The aim, in other words, is to ensure continued growth without bailing out those who have lent or borrowed unwisely. And if central banks deliver this – and it remains a big “if” – it will be a true measure of maturity and ­success in the global economic system.COUNTDOWN TO A CRUNCHFebruary – lenders sing the subprime bluesGlobal stock markets saw their first big wobble of the year as evidence of problems in the US subprime mortgage market began to mount. Data on fourth-quarter defaults by borrowers were released and specialist lenders that served the market began to report losses for the period, starting with the largest, NovaStar. Within a fortnight, shares in the second-largest lender, New Century Financial, had been suspended over concerns about its ability to stay in business. Both now face class-action lawsuits claiming executives misled investors. New Century filed for bankruptcy protection on April 2.May – game over for UBS’s hedge fundUBS announced on May 4 that its adventure with an in-house hedge fund was over. It was forced to fold Dillon Read Capital Management back into its investment banking arm less than two years after it was set up. The decision was triggered by a SFr150m (£62m, $123m, €91m) first-quarter loss on US subprime mortgage investments at its roughly €4.5bn (£3bn, $6bn) fund. The move led to a $300m (£151m, €224m) restructuring charge. By early July, Peter Wuffli, UBS’s chief executive, had been ousted in part over concerns about his handling of the DRCM debacle. This week the bank warned that market turbulence could lead to “very weak” second-half profits.June – Bear Stearns drops a clangerOn June 19, it emerged that investment banks that had lent money to two hedge funds run by Bear Stearns Asset Management were on the verge of seizing assets to try to recover the cash. The highly leveraged funds had invested in supposedly very safe, highly rated complex debt products that in turn had exposure to bonds backed by subprime mortgage debt. The news was followed by a number of other funds reporting significant losses on similar debts. Those included Basis Capitalin Australia, vehicles run by Cheyne Capital and Cambridge Placein London, and Braddock Financialand United Capital in the US. A month after Bear’s problems emerged, investors were told they had lost all their money in one fund and would get back just nine cents for each dollar invested in the second fund.July – private equity comes unstuckFinancing for the Alliance Bootsand Chrysler buy-outs, two of the biggest private equity-backed deals in the markets, ran into serious difficulties on July 25, intensifying fears about the possibility of a credit crunch. Stock markets were hard hit over the following days on concerns that tighter credit conditions could derail the buy-out boom that had boosted equities on the assumption that a bid for nearly any company could be imminent. The news also sparked a growing realisation that the world’s biggest banks were exposed to potential credit problems in a number of fields and that they were beginning to rein in these exposures wherever they could.July-August – the pain spreads to equitiesFears of a widespread credit crunch created high volatility in stock markets and credit markets. The Vix index, Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, hit a number of multi-year highs. Other markets were whipsawed by radical changes of direction almost daily – although this week showed that the general direction was down as the FTSE 100 fell below 6,000 points and the Dow below 13,000 points. Such moves have brought massive problems to quantitative, or “black-box”, hedge funds that thrive on volatility but come unstuck when there are sudden changes in patterns of trading. These problems were most clearly illustrated this week when Goldman Sachswas forced to pay $2bn of its own money to prop up its Global Equities Opportunitiesfund.August – central banks forced to step inThe growing fears about US subprime exposure have spread far beyond US banks and small specialised lenders. Money market funds with exposure to complex securities run by BNP Paribasand others shut their doors to investors wanting their cash back. All kinds of off-balance-sheet lending and arbitrage platforms (known as conduits and structured investment vehicles, or SIVs) have been infected to the point that they are struggling to raise the short-term debt that keeps them afloat. Supporting banks are meant to step in with so-called liquidity facilities to prop them up, but those same banks are desperate to reduce credit exposure and are doing what they can to sit on their hands.The problems at German bank IKBresulted in a bail-out by local peers on August 2, but this only heightened the tension and led to fast-rising interest rates in the overnight lending markets between the banks. The European Central Bank and later the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Russian Central Bank and the Bank of Canada have been forced to take action, supplying markets with the short-term funding they need to keep functioning."
370;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-08-12T19:19:15Z;Shoppers count the carbon;;Pick up a packet of Walkers potato crisps in the UK and you might notice something unusual on the back. Alongside the normal information on how much fat, salt and calories they contain, there is another label. It informs the consumer that the bag contains only 34.5g of crisps, but 75g of carbon dioxide.That carbon dioxide is not to be found within the packet. It is “virtual” CO2 – a calculation of the amount of the gas expelled into the atmosphere as a result of the processes that went into the packet’s production, from growing the potato to packaging and distributing the finished crisps.This is a carbon label, one of the first of its kind in the world. The idea behind it is that today’s consumers, who are growing ever more environmentally conscious, should be able to see how their buying decisions increase or decrease their environmental impact. It can help people to calculate and reduce their own “carbon footprint”, a measure of how many greenhouse gas emissions they are responsible for. Companies can also use such labels to differentiate their products from those of rivals, and in the future even governments could use them to regulate emissions or crack down on companies that are not obeying environmental strictures.“Carbon labels are a way of displaying very clearly what has gone into a product, of measuring what has been the impact on the climate of making that product,” explains Euan Murray of the Carbon Trust, a government-funded body charged with helping businesses to cut their greenhouse gas output.Only a handful of companies are putting carbon labels on their goods at present, most of them in the UK and working in partnership with the Carbon Trust. As well as Walkers, which is owned by PepsiCo, the chemist chain Boots is putting information on the “carbon footprint” of some of its cosmetics ranges at the point of sale. Innocent, a maker of smoothies and fruit juices, puts carbon label information on its products on its website, and may do so on the products in future.But the idea of the labels was given a considerable boost when Terry Leahy, chief executive of Tesco, the supermarket chain with interests in 12 countries, pledged that his company would eventually have carbon labels put on every one of the 70,000 products on its shelves.Tesco’s announcement was quickly followed by the caveat that it might be several years before the retailer was ready to roll out the labels. Some sceptical observers, particularly at rival chains, took the view that the decision was less an environmental advance than an eye-catching attempt to steal a march on other supermarkets, which have been vying to be seen as the greenest. But the commitment, if followed through, would require a large number of companies to measure the carbon in their products and bring carbon labels to the attention of millions of consumers.The Carbon Trust says more than 150 companies have approached it with a view to using the labels. As well as drawing the support of Tesco, the scheme has won backing from J Sainsbury, Marks & Spencer, Cadbury Schweppes, Duchy Originals and the Co-operative Group.Once a manufacturer, whether it be a food processor or a cosmetics company, has put a carbon label on one product, labelling the rest of its lines becomes easier. Walkers found it could roll out carbon labels to all of its crisp packets within months of doing so for cheese and onion, its most popular flavour.Similarly, once one company has introduced carbon labelling, it becomes easier for others to do so. The Carbon Trust is working with BSI British Standards to create a standard that can be used by other companies to create carbon labels.Doing the necessary research involves time and money. Steve John, director of corporate affairs at PepsiCo, says the process of making the labels for Walkers took about 12 to 18 months.But the measurement and monitoring can yield useful information. All of the companies that the Carbon Trust has worked with on the labels have found they could make savings as a result of what they discovered during the process, cutting their costs at the same time as cutting their carbon output.Jessica Sansom, head of sustainability at Innocent Drinks, found it took several months to carry out the monitoring necessary, at a cost of less than £10,000. But she says it was “an incredibly useful process, it threw up lots of very useful information and we’ve been able to identify lots of win-wins in improving our efficiency”.Energy efficiencies are the most obvious saving: Mr Murray of the Carbon Trust estimates that most companies can cut their energy bills by at least 20 per cent. But companies can also save on water bills, raw material usage and even transport. Mr John says PepsiCo found it could cut its transport fuel costs by a fifth by training staff to drive more efficiently. He says the company is conducting research on how consumers react to the labels, to be published this autumn.For shoppers, it may be ­puzzling to see that there are 75g of carbon in a packet of crisps or 294g in a mango and passion fruit smoothie. Until more products have such labels and buyers can compare like with like, their usefulness is limited.Separate research by LEK Consulting, to be published this week, has found that just over half of people in the UK say they “would value details concerning a product’s carbon footprint when making a buying decision”. Rather under half would use this information to switch to a product or service with a lower carbon footprint, however, and only one in five would go to a less convenient retailer in order to obtain such products.But the research, carried out by YouGov among a sample of 2,039 adults, also found that most people were not convinced by the environmental claims of retailers and manufacturers, despite the enormous marketing effort that many companies have put into painting themselves green. Nearly 60 per cent said their claims were “not very” or “not at all” credible.If customers can see a product’s carbon footprint in front of them when they make their purchase, it may do more to convince them of the green credentials of its maker.
371;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-08-08T21:13:16Z;Banks likely to sweeten Tata deal;;Tata Steel’s bankers are likely to sweeten the terms on a £3.6bn ($7.3bn) refinancing package for the Indian group’s takeover of Anglo-Dutch steel maker Corus as a result of the turmoil in the credit markets.About two-thirds of the debt, which is being sold to other banks, is expected to be offloaded without great difficulty, but a £1.5bn higher-yielding loan meant for institutional investors is struggling at the present interest margin, according to people familiar with the deal.“We don’t see any issues with tranches going to the bank market,” said one person. “But the tranche going into the institutional market, we are in the process of figuring that out.”European and US debt markets have seen a sharp change in fortunes in recent weeks, forcing investment banks to cancel or postpone up to $60bn-worth of high-yield debt sales, including loan deals for Alliance Boots and Chrysler, both of which are being bought by private equity.Problems that began in the US subprime mortgage markets have led to a rapid draining of liquidity and a reduction in investor demand from various markets, such as leveraged loans.ABN Amro, Citigroup and Standard Chartered, the banks leading the debt sale for Tata Steel UK, the former Corus business, are being forced to consider increasing the interest margin by ½-¾ of 1 percentage point. When the institutional loan was launched in late July, the guidance for the interest margin was 2.25 per cent over the London interbank rate, which some investors who looked at the deal characterised as aggressive.The banks could also offer investors discounts on the face value of the debt, or try to shift some of it into the portions being sold to other banks. None of the banks leading the sale in London would comment on the deal. Tata Steel officials were unavailable for comment.The Tata-Corus deal and others used a leveraged buy-out type structure more familiar in private equity-backed deals than in corporate takeovers. This involves loading the target company up with the debt used to finance the acquisition.
372;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-08-07T11:17:09Z;Virgin Media delays auction;;Virgin Media, has confirmed it is delaying an auction that had been expected to value the debt-laden UK cable operator at $23bn because of volatile credit markets.A day before the original deadline for indicative offers, Virgin Media said ”potential strategic and financial counterparties had continued to confirm a strong ongoing interest in a transaction” since an initial approach last month, thought to be from Carlyle Group, at $32-$33 per share.At least 10 private equity groups are understood to have requested information on the company, which has already begun management presentations, as well as some cable operators such as John Malone’s Liberty Global.Virgin Media said its advisors had recommended an unspecified delay ”until these parties could complete proposals in a more stable debt market environment”.The proposed buy-out could be the UK’s largest, and analysts had expressed concern about bidders capacity to raise the necessary finance in uncertain credit markets.This is the latest deal to be effected by the downturn in global credit markets. Last week bankers arranging financing for the buy-out of Alliance Boots shelved plans to sell £1bn of second lien debt. The sale of Mitchells & Butlers stake in 1,300 pubs to Robert Tchenguiz was also ditched because of rising debt costs.Meanwhile, Cadbury Schweppes delayed a £7bn sale of its US drinks division and Guy Hands’ attempt to buy EMI almost failed.Virgin Media has faced tough market conditions in the UK that has pitted the media group against BSkyB, the satellite group majority owned by Rupert Murdoch’s New Corporation, and landed it in court.Virgin Media, was created earlier this year after Richard Branson became its largest shareholder.It has signed agreements with Setanta, the Irish sports broadcaster, for Premier football rights to boost its digital television, fixed-line telephony, mobile telephony and broadband package but failed to make significant inroads into Sky’s dominant position in the digital TV market.A falling share price and renewed interest from private equity, thought to be Carlyle Group of the US, has forced a rethink from the company’s owners which include Bill Huff, the distressed debt investor who oversaw the restructuring of NTL, the predecessor to Virgin Media, as well as Mr Branson.Shares in Nasdaq-listed Virgin Media, which reports first half earnings on Wednesday, fell 53 cents to $23.17 at the open.
373;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-08-04T00:02:08Z;Bear gloom drags markets down;;US stocks plunged in late trading on Friday as credit concerns mounted and the chief financial officer of Bear Stearns said fixed-income markets were “as bad as I’ve seen in 22 years”.Markets were hit early on when Standard & Poor’s said there was an increased chance of it downgrading Bear’s credit rating. Bear responded with a conference call for investors, during which Jimmy Cayne, chief executive, said all financial institutions were facing “an extremely challenging environment”.The call did nothing to calm nerves and the S&P 500 index closed 2.7 per cent off. The yield on the two-year US Treasury fell 15 basis points to 4.43 per cent, the lowest since January last year, as futures markets priced in a strong chance of two cuts in the Fed Funds rate this year.The cost of insuring against default on the debt of Wall Street banks rose sharply, with Bear Stearns trading at a level higher than the average for junk bonds.S&P said Bear had a relatively high reliance on both the troubled mortgage and leveraged finance sectors and “profitability would be especially affected if there were an extended downturn in these markets”. It was also concerned on the impact on Bear’s reputation of the collapse of two mortgage hedge funds it managed.This week saw increased signs of pain in the US mortgage market while it emerged on Friday that banks had for the moment abandoned attempts to sell to investors $1bn (£490m) of debt for the leveraged buy-out of Alliance Boots, the pharmacy chain.Sam Molinaro, Bear’s chief financial officer, said it had been profitable in June and July and that it had a strong and highly liquid balance sheet. He also pointed out that Moody’s had recently reaffirmed its credit rating.Credit ratings are particularly important for broker dealers such as Bear Stearns, which depend on the capital markets to fund their balance sheets.The threat of downgrades are likely to increase speculation that Mr Cayne, who did not stay on the conference call to answer questions, might consider selling the company.Bear shares fell more than 6 per cent while Lehman Brothers were off nearly 8 per cent.
374;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-08-03T21:30:11Z;Guy Hands and EMI;;What is Guy Hands playing at? This week the financier’s Terra Firma vehicle finally won enough acceptances to take control of EMI the troubled music group, in a deal with an enterprise value of £3.2bn.As usual, he is tight-lipped and his lieutenant, Stephen Alexander, a drinks industry veteran, will not set out plans until installed on the board in a couple of months. But the rump of the business – recorded music, accounting for almost 80 per cent of revenues but only 30 per cent of operating profits – will probably be sold. The disentanglement could start in October, once the EU’s Competition Commission rules on the combination of the music units of Japan’s Sony and Germany’s Bertelsmann.A verdict in favour might allow EMI to offload the division, most likely to its long-term sparring partner in merger discussions, Warner Music. The combination could realise synergies valued at, say, £1bn. Mr Hands would then be free to gear up the remaining music publishing arm and develop its digital sales.Until its sale, the recorded music business might benefit from private ownership. Freed from the tyranny of public earnings, A&R heads could nurture new talent while tolerating album delays from big-selling acts such as Gorillaz and Coldplay.That is a best case scenario. The worst case is a “no” from Brussels, further pain from CD sales – recorded music sales tumbled 15 per cent last financial year – with insufficient compensation from digital.Despite the vote of confidence from Citigroup, which stood by its pledge of £2bn of debt funding even after last-minute jitters, Hands will be nervous. His personal brand is still tainted by the near-collapse of the Le Meridien hotel chain in 2003 and his recent, aborted run at Alliance Boots. Private equity’s enfant terrible is in as much need of a hit as Robbie Williams, one of EMI’s more erratic performers.
375;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-08-03T19:17:53Z;Banks shelve £1bn Boots debt sale;;Banks arranging the financing for the £11bn private equity buy-out of Alliance Boots have shelved for at least a month attempts to sell £1bn of so-called second lien debt, a further sign of the problems besetting the credit markets.The development follows last month’s decision to cancel the sale of £5bn in senior loans, which rank just ahead of the second lien loans, and takes place in spite of a discount that would have given investors £1bn of debt for £960m.The credit market downturn, triggered by the US subprime mortgage crisis, has made it difficult to sell the debt used to fund private equity deals. Concerns about an end to the leveraged buy-out boom have affected stock markets worldwide.The FTSE 100 closed 1.2 per cent lower on Friday at 6,224.3, after US stocks opened weaker in the wake of subprime concerns and news that Bear Stearns, one of the banks at the centre of recent market turmoil, could see its credit ratings downgraded by Standard & Poor’s, the credit agency.People close to Boots – which is being bought by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Stephano Pessina, Boots’s billionaire former chairman – were keen to point out that the postponed debt sale posed no problems for the company because the banks had already provided the debt to Boots.One person close to the second lien debt sale said while there had been a lot of orders for the debt at the discounted price, there was still nervousness among investors about the potential for the loans to lose value in post-sale trading.The banks’ experience with Boots contrasts sharply with that of Chrysler, which this week managed to sell $8bn (£3.9bn) of buy-out debt for its finance arm at a discount price of 95 cents in the dollar and saw it trade at up to 98 cents in the secondary market. Nevertheless, the US market faces by far the larger glut of junk-rated debt supply.The banks are expected to test investor appetite for the Boots debt again at the end of summer.Mitchells & Butlers’ sale of a stake in 1,300 pubs to Robert Tchenguiz, the billionaire property magnate, was ditched this week because of rising debt costs.Last week, Cadbury Schweppes delayed a £7bn sale of its US drinks division, blaming “extreme volatility” in debt markets after two private equity consortia lining up bids found financing much harder to come by.Virgin Media, the cable company, has deferred the original deadline of next week for bidders to make indicative offers. Numerous private equity firms have expressed interest in Sir Richard Branson’s group since Carlyle made an inactive approach worth $23bn in debt and equity. But recent market conditions have raised questions about whether offers for such a large target can be financed.A planned sale by Ford of its Jaguar and Land Rover luxury brands could also suffer from turmoil in the debt markets.
376;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-08-03T16:45:36Z;There may be more to come, say experts;;Standard & Poor’s, the credit ratings service, has warned that equity investors are likely to see further periods of market instability after the largest one-day decline in four years last week.Falls on four of the five trading days last week – including the largest in four years on Thursday – saw the FTSE-100 end the week 5.6 per cent lower, wiping out all stock market gains this year.The FTSE-250 was similarly struck, finishing 7.1 per cent down for the week.This past week, instability again reigned with a rebound on Tuesday, all but cancelled out by an opening fall on Wednesday.Worries about the US mortgage market continued to haunt global equities. News that the credit arrangements for the £11bn buy-out of Alliance Boots and $7.4bn purchase of Chrysler appeared uncertain caused a shock wave for a market that has been buoyed by private equity buy-out mania.Robert Quinn, European strategist at Standard & Poor’s, says European equity markets are likely to fall further in the next two weeks owing to further knock-on effects from instabilities in the credit market, high oil prices and negative currency movements.Quinn explains: “European equity markets have experienced a re-rating of risk premiums. Returns since mid-March have now been reversed as markets globally pare back. In our view, signals from credit markets have left equity investors in a state of confusion as to their interpretations in the past few months.”There is uncertainty among investors and fund managers. Roddy Kohn, managing director at KohnCougar, the Bristol-based financial adviser, has moved the UK weightings to equities in his client’s portfolios from an average of 35 per cent three weeks ago to only 10 per cent.Instead, Kohn says, he has invested the money in high yielding cash savings and fixed return funds. “We’ve taken the profit out of stocks that have risen strongly for the past three years,” he adds.New Star fund manager Craig Heron forecasts the market could see a correction of about 10 per cent by the end of the year – including the recent downturn – and has moved more into cash holdings as a short-term provision.Heron also considers taking a put option to mitigate further falls in the market although he says this would be a short-term plan as he sees equities rising in the medium to long term.There are already signs that sophisticated investors are using such options to take advantage of the volatility in the market.Last week, there was record volumes of trades at derivatives exchanges, with, for example, put options on the UK’s FTSE-100 – which give the buyer the right to sell at an agreed price in the future – rising to more than 66,000 on the Thursday.And there are other investors who are finding the silver lining in the week’s performance.If the market has fallen, according to some, it must be cheap, particularly as many economists are saying the underlying valuations of the market remain sound.Dan Kemp, head of fund research at investment manager, Williams De Broe, says more of its investors’ money has been moved into equities this week.The average weighting in the Williams De Broe “aggressive” portfolios has now changed, with cash holdings reduced to nothing from 4 per cent and the money moved into equities.Cash holdings in its moderate portfolios have also been reduced. “The fundamentals are very good and we see this as a buying chance,” Kemp says.Similarly, some fund managers are seeing an opportunity. Also at New Star, chief investment officer, Stephen Whittaker, takes a different view from his colleague Heron. He says the market is poised for sustained growth for “at least several more years”. He forecasts the market will end the year at about 10 per cent higher than it started.John Gumpel, director at wealth manager, Brooks Macdonald, warns the correction is unlikely to be over but this should not be seen negatively by equity investors, who should be holding stocks for the longer term.“There is a floor but I doubt we have reached it yet. We always saw 2007 as a year of adjustment and we’ve been saying to our clients that it has been over- extended.”Gumpel can see the bull market continuing beyond 2007 and welcomes the fact some value is coming back into parts of the market. He points to real estate stocks – where many of his investors realised profits some time ago – as looking particularly cheap at the moment.
377;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-08-02T21:08:44Z;Bankers try to digest effects of subprime disorder;;City bankers are beginning to sound like doctors treating gastric disorders. “It is a serious case of indigestion. There will be a lot of pain. But it will pass. Come back and see me in September, when things should have cleared up,” a senior investment banker said this week.The indigestion he was referring to is the nervousness spreading through debt markets, triggered by the US subprime mortgage crisis, pulling the rug out from some planned buy-outs and leaving banks facing losses upon financing for others.The latest victim is Mitchells & Butlers’ sale of a stake in 1,300 pubs to Robert Tchenguiz, the billionaire property magnate, ditched on Thursday because of rising debt costs.Elsewhere, banks have taken the pain on buy-out deals that have already been underwritten. At Alliance Boots, lenders have been stuck with much of the £9bn of debt issued to fund a takeover by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm.Last week, Cadbury Schweppes delayed a £7bn sale of its US drinks division, blaming “extreme volatility” in debt markets after two private equity consortia lining up bids found financing much harder to come by.Virgin Media, the cable company, has deferred an original deadline of next week for bidders to make indicative offers. Numerous private equity firms have expressed interest in Sir Richard Branson’s group since Carlyle made an inactive approach worth $23bn in debt and equity. But recent market conditions have raised questions about whether offers for such a large target can be financed.Terra Firma’s £2.4bn offer for EMI became a test case of banks’ willingness to stand by borrowers.News that the deal had completed on Thursday – and that Citigroup had not attempted to walk away from the financing – reassured some arbitrageurs. One said: “It gives people some comfort that the bank stood by them.”Analysts are concerned two other pending media deals – possible sales of Virgin Radio and Emap – could be derailed by a sustained credit crunch, or that sellers may have to settle for lower prices than they had hoped.A planned sale by Ford of its Jaguar and Land Rover luxury brands in the UK – expected to involve heavy private equity interest – could also suffer from turmoil in the debt markets. That could favour trade bidders, such as India’s Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra.Credit market volatility seemed poised to claim another victim on Thursday as Alchemy Partners’ plan to buy Civica, the public sector software provider, for £190m was teetering on the brink of collapse.An announcement about the ending of bid talks could be made as early as Friday.Private equity groups seeking to sell assets – such as 3i’s aborted attempt to sell NCP Services after bids came in at less than its target valuation – will be hoping the diagnosis is correct about the indigestion clearing up by September.
378;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-29T18:29:36Z;Debt market heartburn;;What if high-yield debt markets face more than just a nasty bout of indigestion? If investors’ rejection of senior debt tranches from recent mega buy-outs of Alliance Boots and Chrysler signals a longer-term change, it raises serious questions about the business models of the new kings of Wall Street – especially for those that now have the scrutiny of a public market listing.Take Blackstone. The private equity group has raised ever-bigger funds in anticipation of pulling off ever-bigger deals to put the money to work. That has been a great strategy for a while. There is less competition for huge deals, meaning prices sometimes do not get quite so stretched, and huge companies can be less risky than smaller businesses. The private equity firm can book big deal fees upfront from a single transaction. And, with a limited number of investment professionals, Blackstone can put large amounts of money to work quickly.But what happens if there is no longer an endless supply of cheap debt to match with the massive piles of equity in order to buy companies? That means either scrabbling around in smaller transactions and offering financing terms attractive enough to draw in debt investors or simply waiting for the sentiment to change regarding mega-deals. The former strategy would require more investment professionals to get the money invested and, in aggregate, would require just as much debt as a few big deals. It could be tough. The other option is to sit and hope that the debt markets recover enough for more very large buy-outs.That might happen. If not, the private equity kings could be left sitting on huge cash piles for a while. For publicly quoted companies, that means lower deal fees and potentially more difficulty raising new mega funds – a key part of their growth stories. According to Private Equity Intelligence, private equity groups are already in the process of raising new mega-funds totalling $144bn. That might cause a little indigestion of its own.
379;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;‘Wake-up call’ for investors;;Wall Street closed lower on Friday after a tumultuous week in which the S&P 500 index experienced its worst performance since September 2002 as heightened credit market concerns battered stocks.London saw all this year’s gains wiped out. There were also heavy falls in Asian stock markets, European stocks were lower and corporate debt markets saw further sell-offs.The selling rounded off a week that finally saw equity traders waken to the growing problems in debt markets.The heaviest stock selling on Thursday was sparked by news that banks had been forced to pull debt sales for two of the biggest private equity backed buy-outs in the market.Chrysler, the US carmaker, failed to attract demand for loans valued at $12bn and Alliance Boots debt worth £5bn was left on banks’ balance sheets.Fears about an end to the ­leveraged buy-out boom added to the expanding crisis in US mortgage markets, where one of the biggest US lenders said this week that problems in the risky subprime market were spreading to more conventional loans.Mr Paulson said in an interview on CNBC television that both the mortgage lending and leveraged buy-out markets had been marked by excesses.“I think we could use some more discipline. We are seeing a reassessment of risk and that is leading to a market adjustment,” he said, adding that it was “healthy” that risk was being ­repriced.Mr Paulson said problems in the US mortgage sector should remain “largely contained”, but stressed “this is something that will take a while to make its way through the economy”.Stocks briefly rallied after Mr Paulson’s remarks but then resumed their descent.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 index was down 4.9 per cent for the week at 1,458.95 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 4.7 per cent lower at 2,562.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 4.2 per cent lower at 13,265.47 for the week.News that the US economy had expanded at a 3.4 per cent annual rate and that core inflation moderated during the second quarter failed to improve sentiment.The FTSE 100 finished at 6,215.2, erasing all its gains for the year. It hit a peak of 6,732.4 on June 15, when it was 8.2 per cent higher on the year. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 5 per cent, its worst weekly performance since March.A flight to safety saw US government bonds rally, the yen strengthen and emerging market debt and equities stumble. An index of the main indicators of risk across asset classes compiled by UBS showed that risk-aversion had hit its highest level since the terrorist attacks in September 2001.The strengthening of the Japanese currency indicates an unwinding of the carry trade, in which investors borrow in cheaper currencies to buy higher-yielding assets elsewhere, which has been a significant source of liquidity in global markets.Corporate debt markets slid, with investors doubting that a $300bn backlog of US bond and loan deals would clear quickly. Issuance of new US high-yield debt this month has sunk to the lowest level since October 2002 at the trough of the last credit crunch, said Thomson Financial.
380;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-27T17:30:13Z;On London: FTSE shaken but fundamental support remains intact;;For those City traders and investors who have not jetted off for their summer holidays, the past week has been seriously alarming.After sharp falls on Tuesday and Wednesday, the FTSE 100 suffered its biggest one day percentage decline in four years on Thursday and sustained further losses on Friday to end the week down 370 points, or 5.6 per cent.This left the blue chip index in negative territory for the year and at a four-month low.The damage was no less severe lower down the market. The FTSE 250 lost 835 points, or 7.1 per cent, over the week and ended at its lowest level since March.The sell-off was initially triggered in the US where investors were unnerved by signs that the problems in the subprime mortgage market were spreading to conventional home loans.The next jolt came from the credit market where financing for two of the biggest private equity deals of the year – the £11bn buy-out of Alliance Boots and $7.4bn purchase of Chrysler – ran into serious difficulties.That news raised concerns that tighter credit conditions could derail the buy-out boom that has done much to support stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic.De-equitisation – retiring equity through cash takeovers and big share buy-backs – has helped drive the London market higher over the past few years. But bankers say the market for selling leveraged debt is in effect closed for the moment.Unsurprisingly, traders reacted to these fears by selling any stock recently touted as a private equity bid target.Shares in Home Retail Group ended the week down 12.4 per cent, while InterContinental Hotels Group fell 12 per cent. Whitbread, which is rumoured to be a takeover target for Starwood Capital, dropped 11.4 per cent and Punch Taverns shed 10.8 per cent.There were also big falls for companies currently in takeover talks or set to complete large debt-related transactions.FKI, the engineering group, which has been in discussions with a buyer since the end of May, lost 18.8 per cent. Pub operator Mitchells & Butlers, which is putting the finishing touches to a £4.75bn property deal with financier Robert Tchenguiz, closed the week with a loss of 7.1 per cent.The sell-off raised fears the initial public offering pipeline could dry up. Moneysupermarket.com did manage to float this week, but it was forced to price its offer at the bottom end of the range. At the close of trading on Friday, it shares were 7.5 per cent below the 170p placing price. In spite of the turmoil, equity strategists think there are still reasons for optimism.“This is a liquidity and sentiment sell-off. There has been little change so far to the fundamental economic outlook. Economic and corporate profit data is still supportive,” says Jonathan Stubbs, head of European Equity Strategy at Citigroup. He points out that corporate balance sheets remain strong and equity investors continue to benefit from large capital returns. This week GlaxoSmithKline doubled the size of its share buy-back to £12bn.While the buy-out boom might have ended, corporate deals are still happening. Friends Provident and Resolution announced an £8bn merger this week only for the deal to be gate-crashed by rival Pearl, which raided the market for a 15.85 per cent interest in Resolution.Valuations also remain attractive.“The recent correction has lifted the 2008 dividend yield on the FTSE 100 to slightly above 4 per cent, with the yield in the banks sector currently hovering around 6 per cent. The value support for the FTSE 100 is therefore considerable at current levels,” says Darren Winder, Head of Macro and Strategy at Cazenove.Unfortunately, these factors are likely to count for little if global markets are in the grip of a liquidity-driven sell-off, where investors are forced to sell shares to meet margin calls.
381;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-27T11:09:55Z;Cadbury delays sale of US soft drinks arm;;The turmoil in the credit markets claimed two new victims on Friday when Cadbury-Schweppes said it was delaying the sale of its US soft drinks arm and bankers shelved the €8bn sale of ISS, Europe’s largest cleaning services company.Cadbury-Schweppes announced it was indefinitely extending the timetable for the £7bn-plus sale of its US beverages business as highly volatile debt markets stopped some banks lending money to finance deals.It is understood that all of the banks that the Lion-Blackstone-KKR consortium had lined up to back its acquisition of Cadbury’s beverage unit have pulled out.Banks say the volatility re­flects the re-pricing of risk. “The power has switched from the borrower to the lender,” one said.The company has received initial bids from two private equity consortiums, which had planned to finance their offers mostly with debt. “The deal is stuck at the moment,” said one. “You can’t borrow dollars.”If Cadbury cannot complete a sale at an acceptable price, it is likely to pursue a demerger, which would involve listing its beverages business in the US.Cadbury shares have fallen 16 per cent in the past two months to close at 603.50p yesterday.The decision to shelve the sale of ISS was taken by Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs after three private equity bidders withdrew from the process because of turmoil in the credit markets.In June, the private equity owners of ISS started a review of the business, including a potential listing. However, the company moved to sell it after receiving potential offers.
382;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-26T20:53:23Z;Asian stock markets join global slide;;Asian stockmarkets on Friday joined a global tumble amid a flight away from risky credits and fears about banks’ growing exposure to leveraged buy-out debts.In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei average dropped more than 2 per cent to hit its lowest level in nearly three months while the yen hit a three-month high against the dollar.After hitting a record Thursday the Shanghai Composite index fell as much as 1.8 per cent in early trade but had recovered to be down only 0.1 per cent at the end of morning trade.But markets in Australia, Hong Kong, and India were all down by around 2 per cent with MSCI’s index of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan down by more than 2 per cent.There was also fallout in emerging Asian currencies with the Indian rupee having its biggest fall in six weeks and the Philippine peso heading for its biggest weekly fall in six and a half years, according to Bloomberg.At the close of trade in New York, the S&P 500 index was down 2.3 per cent at 1,483.17, having rebounded from its low of the day of 1,465.30, as investors sought the safety of government debt, pushing the yield on the 10-year US Treasury down 11 basis points to 4.79 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite was 1.8 per cent down at 2,599.34. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.3 per cent lower at 13,473.82.Investment bank stocks led the market lower on worries that they will have to use their balance sheets to fund private equity deals. The S&P investment bank index was down 5.3 per cent.Concerns about the possibility of a credit contraction were exacerbated this week when banks gave up attempts to sell to investors $20bn of debt for the leveraged buy-outs of Chrysler and Alliance Boots, the UK retailer.A Financial Times analysis shows that in recent weeks, bank balance sheets have absorbed more than $40bn of high-yield debt for buy-out deals that was meant to be sold to investors.The biggest lenders to private equity buyers are large commercial banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup. But investment banks, led by Goldman Sachs, have dramatically scaled up their commitments to leveraged buy-outs this year.According to regulatory filings, Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns had combined non-investment grade commitments of about $180bn at the end of May, $80bn more than at the end of February. The bulk of these commitments are for leveraged buy-outs.Goldman had non-investment grade commitments of $71.6bn and Morgan Stanley $34.8bn. Lehman said its “non-investment-grade contingent acquisition facilities” were $43.9bn, while Bear Stearns disclosed “contingent commitments” of $20.8bn. None of the banks would say what had happened to their level of commitments since the end of May.Bankers say the combined figure of $180bn appeared high in relation to the estimated $300bn that all lenders have committed for leveraged buy-out deals in the US for the rest of the year.The size of the commitments raises questions about potential losses if the banks are unable to sell the debt to investors at the terms agreed when the deals were done.The worries about leverage lending commitments reinforced anxieties about bank stocks triggered by diminishing investor appetite for complex debt securities and problems in the US mortgage market.Housing starts in the US fell 6.6 per cent in June, the government said on Thursday, and several homebuilders reported second-quarter losses.
383;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-26T20:06:11Z;Banks burnt by credit meltdown;;Credit derivatives markets saw a strong bout of further heavy selling on Thursday in both Europe and the US, with the widely watched indices of riskier credits bearing the brunt of the pain.Behind the headline numbers, banks and other financials have been among the worst affected as investors worry about their exposure to a range of problem areas from mortgage markets to the leveraged loans that fund private equity buy-out deals.The iTraxx Crossover index, the key barometer of appetite for credit risk in Europe, saw the cost of protecting €10m ($13.7m) of mostly junk rated corporate debt jump above €400,000 per year on the five-year contract for the first time in almost two years.The index at 400 basis points is more than twice the level at the start of June. Its US cousin also traded at record levels, hitting 326bp.The perceived credit risk of owning the debt of US banks, which has soared in recent weeks, jumped to new highs yesterday as investors reacted to revelations that Wall Street had been left saddled with billions of dollars of unsold corporate debt.Analysis by the Financial Times shows that investment banks in the US and Europe could have already been forced to retain more than $40bn worth of high-yield debt that they intended to sell in recent weeks.Investor appetite for high-risk, high-yield debt has significantly diminished – illustrated this week by the failure to place about $20bn worth of loans for just two companies, Chrysler and Alliance Boots.US banks especially had already seen both their stock prices and credit default swaps – which provide a kind of insurance against non-payment of debt – under heavy pressure owing to their exposure to US subprime mortgage crisis and to the hedge funds that were invested in related products.“A lot of people are spooked that the [credit] lines extended to hedge funds have created massive counterparty risk,” said Christian Stracke, a senior analyst at CreditSights. “We can’t really have a great sense for what counterparty exposure is – and these players are beginning to drop off like flies under the weight of subprime.”However, he added that the market was nervous more because of uncertainty than because banks were obviously in dire straits.JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs postponed on Wednesday the sale of $12bn of debt financing for Cerberus’s purchase of Chrysler. The US carmaker has agreed to hold $2bn, leaving the banks with a hefty $10bn on their books.The two banks’ CDS hit their highest levels since 2003 yesterday. JPMorgan’s CDS was at 75bp, an increase of 25bp on the day, according to data from broker Phoenix Partners Group.The bank is Wall Street’s biggest underwriter of leveraged loans, according to Bloomberg data, and its cost of protection in CDS markets has tripled in the past five weeks.Meanwhile, Goldman’s CDS jumped as much as 18bp to 85bp.However, one of the worst hit is Bear Stearns, the largest US underwriter of mortgage-backed bonds, which saw its CDS rise to 105bp from 83.50bp on Wednesday. This is five times the level seen at the beginning of this year, and the highest of any bank on the Street.Most of these banks have also seen their stock prices stumble. Bear is down 23 per cent this year after falling another 3.7 per cent to $124.49 on Thursday. JPMorgan is down 8.5 per cent and Lehman 16 per cent.The S&P investment bank index tumbled 3.7 per cent on Thursday and is down 9.1 per cent in 2007.Another barometer of bank stress and a leading indicator for credit market weakness is the interest rate swaps market, which is now at the widest levels over US Treasury yields since February 2002.Additional reporting by Sudeep Doshi
384;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;FTSE plummets amid credit crunch fears;;The London market suffered its biggest one day percentage fall since March 2003 on Thursday as fears about a possible credit crunch intensified.The FTSE 100 dropped 203.1 points, or 3.15 per cent, to a four-month low of 6,251.2 as investors fled the market on fears the buy-out boom, which has underpinned stock prices, could be at an end.The selling intensified in the final 30 minutes of trading – the index fell 86 points – as hedge fund and investment banks sold FTSE futures contracts in order to hedge their portfolios.Thursday’s fall was the biggest since March 12, 2003. On that day, with the Iraq war looming, the FTSE 100 tumbled 4.8 per cent.Thursday’s losses were not confined to blue chips. The FTSE 250 slumped 382.5 points, or 3.35 per cent, to close at a four month low of 11,033.4. Elsewhere, the FTSE All Share index sank 104.08 points, or 3.1 per cent, to 3,228.93.Market turnover was above average with 4.4bn shares changing hands.Traders said the trigger for the sell-off was Wednesday’s news that financing for the buy-outs of Alliance Boots and Chrysler had run into problems. Adding to the gloom was news of further weakness in the US housing market and a spike in the oil price, which rekindled inflation fears.Legal & General led the market lower. Its shares dropped 8.2 per cent to 138.1p after half-year results disappointed and the insurance company did not hand back as much of its excess capital as shareholders would have liked.Rumoured buy-out targets was also under pressure as investors took the view that bidders would now struggle to fund their bids.InterContinental Hotels dropped 7.5 per cent to £11.09, while Whitbread lost 4.3 per cent to £16.75 and Debenhams ended 5.9 per cent weaker at 123½p.Cadbury Schweppes was marked 4.3 per cent lower at 589½p on concerns the credit crunch could affect plans to sell its beverage business. “While a demerger remains the fall-back option, we think Cadbury will be keen to get the disposal away. We cut our assumption of the gross proceeds from £7.5bn to £7bn,” Panmure Gordon said.ICI slipped 2.2 per cent to close at 589p – 11p below the price of Akzo Nobel’s recently rebuffed bid.Traders said hedge funds were facing margin calls and being forced to sell their ICI positions in spite of the fact that most believe Akzo, which is set to receive €11bn from the sale of its drug business, will return with a higher offer.It was a poor day for retail stocks after Citigroup cut its earnings forecasts for the sector. The broker said it expected growth in earnings before interest and tax of just 2 per cent in 2007 and just 1 per cent in 2008. Its previous forecasts were 6 and 8 per cent respectively. The broker said Home Retail Group, which it downgraded to sell, would be hardest hit by the slowdown. HRG eased 2.9 per cent to 69p.Only one blue-chip stock managed to close the session with a gain of more than 1 per cent – Resolution, the insurance group that on Wednesday announced a deal to merge with Friends Provident, 6.5 per cent weaker at 181½p.Resolution shares rose 2.5 per cent to 631½p after Pearl Assurance, a rival insurance company run by financier Hugh Osmond, announced an 11.3 per cent stake.After the market closed Pearl said it was not in favour of the FP deal and was keen to explore alternative ways to “maximise value” for Resolution shareholders.Away from the blue chips, Admiral was marked 5 per cent lower at 748p after Moneysupermarket.com, the price comparison website, made a disappointing stock market debut. Placed at 170p, the shares closed at 158p. Admiral owns Confused.com, a rival price comparison website, which it recently tried to sell.Aga Foodservice Group eased 1.9 per cent to 418p. However, traders noted a block of 1m shares had been purchased at 435p. The talk in the market was that the buyer could be a fund liked to financier Edmund Truell.Last week, one of his vehicles declared a 3 per cent holding in Aga, a move which triggered speculation that Mr Truell might bid for the company in order to get at its pension fund.
385;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-26T18:27:08Z;Subprime coming home to roost?;;"At least some people are benefiting from the pain being felt by American homeowners. Word on Wall Street is that the head of one trading desk, after making a lucrative bet against securities backed by mortgages to people with bad credit histories, has had T-shirts made up that cheerfully proclaim: “I’m short your house”.Few share this glee. Difficulties for the US housing market have been evident for at least a year and data this week showed the overhang of unsold existing homes at its highest level since 1992, at the end of the nation’s last housing recession.Nowhere are the difficulties more evident than in so-called subprime mortgages, extended to people with poor credit histories, for which the losses could be as high as $100bn (£49bn, €73bn), according to the Federal Reserve. The ABX index, a popular measure of bonds backed by subprime mortgages, is down 60 per cent this year.A rash of bankruptcies at subprime lenders prompted a market wobble in February and March but traders swiftly decided the problem was contained. Equity markets across the world continued to rally, while the credit market remained phenomenally high in historical terms, thanks in large part to the growth of credit derivatives. These prompted optimism that it had become easier to spread risk and so it was justifiable that even the riskiest companies could obtain credit cheaply.That mood of optimism is over. Fear now rules the credit markets, where the effective cost of ensuring against a default, in both Europe and the US, has increased by more than half in barely a month. A steady drip of bad news has prompted fears that the subprime debacle could trigger a credit crunch, raising the cost of financing worldwide as investors are forced to sell healthy investments to make good their losses.Problems at two hedge funds run by Bear Stearns, the New York investment bank, perhaps did most to change the mood. Both had heavy subprime exposures. Markets were unnerved both by initial difficulties placing a value on those securities – showing that the market was illiquid – and by the result, which saw one fund wiped out and the other written down by 90 per cent.Subprime-related woes have afflicted hedge funds as far away as Australia. Meanwhile, banks have failed to raise the bond and loan refinancing they sought after backing several big acquisitions. The latest examples are the postponement of a $12bn DaimlerChrysler loan deal, a consequence of the huge transaction that will see control of its US Chrysler division pass to Cerberus, the US hedge fund, and the failure by banks to sell £5bn of senior loans to fund the UK’s biggest leveraged buy-out – of Alliance Boots, the pharmacies chain.Added to this is evidence that “prime” US mortgages are also becoming affected. Countrywide, one of the largest US mortgage banks, said that was the case when announcing poor results this week. This would move the problems into a vastly bigger market and affect mainstream investors who had shunned subprime exposure.In turn, such concerns have prompted fears for stocks, which have received great support in recent years from “de-equitisation” – using cash to retire shares, either through corporate buy-backs, debt-funded mergers or private equity buy-outs. All push up share prices by reducing the amount of stock in circulation and all have relied on historically cheap debt.It was only on Thursday that stocks finally grasped the grim consequences for the mathematics of de-equitisation. The FTSE-100 suffered its worst day since the invasion of Iraq, almost wiping out its gains for the year amid great volatility. But the S&P 500, despite a similar sell-off, remained only 4.5 per cent below its all-time record set last week.There are two starkly opposing explanations for stocks’ belated reaction. Bears say that cheap credit has provided the stock market with crucial support and that valuations can no longer be sustained. Jeremy Grantham, the respected founder of GMO, a large fund manager, goes so far as to liken the stock market to a dinosaur. “As yet the equity market seems totally unaffected, with volatile and risky stocks still making the running. Although the brontosaurus has been bitten on the tail, the message has not yet reached its tiny brain, but is proceeding up the long backbone, one vertebra at a time.”A more positive view is that the credit market is undergoing a healthy correction and that it is natural for the credit and equity markets to diverge. Private equity investors, and companies themselves, are raising credit cheaply and using it to buy back shares. This directly favours equity investors at the expense of credit investors, who are left lending to companies with more debt on their balance sheet and hence a higher risk of default.Larry Hatheway and Jeffrey Palma of UBS make this point forcefully in a recent note. “Shareholder-friendly behaviour in the form of mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buy-outs and buybacks should benefit equity investors relative to bondholders,” they say. They describe recent moves as fundamentally consistent and “rational”.On this reading, there is no reason for equities to fall until returns for shareholders and lenders have been brought into balance.Jonathan Morton of Credit Suisse said in a note that 28 per cent of S&P 1500 non-financial companies have free cash flow yields higher than their cost of capital – classic conditions for a private equity buyout. He added that it would take a five percentage point rise in corporate bond yields, which still looks highly unlikely, before this fell to less than 10 per cent of companies. Thus he expected private equity to remain a feature of the market, but not the principal driver.Marc Chandler, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, says: “While tighter credit is a concern, we posit that conditions are simply returning to a more ‘normal’ level after ‘abnormally’ loose conditions over the past few years.”Practitioners on the ground in the credit market find it hard to be so sanguine. Rather than an orderly correction, they confront a situation where the market for riskier forms of credit seems to have come to a complete halt. US issuance of high-yield, or low-quality, debt stayed below $1bn for the third successive week, according to Thomson Financial. The last week of June brought $9.7bn of high-yield issuance; by last week that had fallen to $322m. This financing is crucial for private equity deals.“The cancellation of high-yield deals and the inability of the large banks to syndicate their leveraged loans is causing the credit markets to shut down,” says T. J. Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “Something has to give here: either equities have to give it up or credit is going to implode.“We knew this was coming,” he adds, “and the question is whether we reach a critical mass that causes a financial seizure or an economic event.” He says the next six to eight weeks, usually a quiet time for markets as many traders take their vacations, will be critical.Problems for the credit market have also translated into further weakness for the dollar, which was already at its lowest level for more than a decade against various currencies before the credit market’s woes began in earnest.One big support for the dollar is the inflow of foreign money used to buy US debt securities. If demand for these securities continues to collapse, the dollar will lose another support. Another perverse effect is that government bonds, subject to a dramatic sell-off last month as traders reacted to stronger economic data, are recovering. This is because investors are seeking a low-risk “safe haven”.David Ader, rates strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, says: “If it were only a story of the economic data, yields would be higher for sure. But it’s not a case of the data but this grinding unwind of risk and decrease in risk tolerance. It’s a process, it’s a theme, and it won’t end tomorrow.” Admitting he does not know the answer, he says traders are betting either that this return of risk aversion hits stocks and hurts the economy or that it merely hurts Wall Street, leaving Main Street unscathed.Regulators, however, still appear to believe that the problem will not cause a systemic crisis for the market and will require no external intervention. Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, in publicly estimating subprime losses at $50bn-$100bn, declined to reassure investors that the problem would not spread to other markets. But the central bank still seems confident that the process at work is a healthy one that will remove excesses.“The punishment has been meted out to those who have done misdeeds and made bad judgments,” said William Poole, governor of the St Louis Fed, last week. “We are getting good evidence that the companies and hedge funds that are being hit are the ones who deserve it.”This may justify the confidence of investors. Yet equity markets were sending some warning signals before Thursday’s plunge. Financial stocks have sharply underperformed, while the largest stocks are outperforming smaller companies. This “narrowing” of the market to the biggest names typically happens at the end of a long bull market.But equities can also point to separate means of support. US corporate earnings appear to be on course to grow at an annual rate of more than 5 per cent in the second quarter – impressive after four years of uninterrupted strong growth. Companies are not heavily geared, so costlier credit will not much dent their profits.Until Thursday, emerging market equities were still within 1.5 per cent of their record highs, while the price of emerging market debt has fallen much less than that of US corporate debt over the past few weeks. This suggests that confidence in the secular growth of the big emerging markets remains intact, despite the current wave of risk aversion.Nor is the credit market the only source of liquidity. The large sovereign wealth funds of oil-rich states and successful Asian economies have a surfeit of cash and a need to place it somewhere. China’s purchase of a stake in Blackstone, the giant private equity house, and its role in Barclays’ bid for ABN Amro suggest that this cash will continue to support the market.Hence even some of the most aggressive bears suggest stocks could avoid a decisive turn downward for another year. As Mr Grantham puts it: “A few more bolts in the bridge may fail, but in the end you have to bet that the bridge will hold, supported by amazing animal spirits. The odds of failure rise but they probably don’t become high until October 2008.”For the time being, there is less optimism in the credit market. Jim Reid, credit strategist at Deutsche Bank in London, Thursday recommended buying back into credit, having for months advocated betting on spreads to increase. But he said he expected the credit cycle to end “very messily” thanks to the “indiscriminate leverage” seen during the bullish period.He added: “As a minimum the thing we are in little doubt about now is that having a huge derivative credit market does not give us a new paradigm of permanently tighter spreads, but instead a potentially violent and volatile credit market.”"
386;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-25T23:16:33Z;Debt problems raise fears of credit crunch;;Financing for the Chrysler and Alliance Boots buy-outs – two of the biggest private equity deals in the global markets – ran into serious difficulties on Wednesday, intensifying fears about the possibility of a credit crunch.Banks failed in their attempts to sell loans financing the deals to investors – even after offering higher interest rates. That means the banks will have to hold the loans on their balance sheets, limiting their ability to underwrite new leveraged buy-outs.The banks had been trying to arrange $20bn in financing for Cerberus’s purchase of Chrysler, the US carmaker, from Daimler. But they postponed the sale of $12bn of debt attached to the company’s carmaking operations. The banks will instead hold $10bn of the loans – hoping to sell the debt to investors later – with Cerberus and Daimler taking on $1bn each.The deal’s underwriters also improved terms on $6bn of debt for the carmaker’s financing arm, after cancelling an additional $2bn of loans last week.In Europe, the eight banks selling £9bn worth of loans for UK retailer Boots, the biggest buy-out in UK history, threw in the towel after trying to place £5bn in senior loans. They also sold £1.75bn of junior debt at far bigger discounts than expected, wiping out their 2–2.5 per cent fees and leaving them with losses.Cadbury-Schweppes is also understood to be concerned that it may not be able to complete a sale of its US beverages business, a deal which has been talked down to £7bn from £8bn two months ago.Problems placing the debt for such big deals could signal that the peak has passed in the recent LBO boom. Marek Gumienny, a managing director at Candover, the UK buy-out firm, said: “The main issue is the amount of debt stuck with underwriters, which could have an effect on deals going forward. We’ve heard rumours that some banks have shut up shop for the summer: no more credit.”Roger Altman, the former deputy US Treasury secretary who runs Evercore, a boutique investment bank, disagreed, saying in a video interview with the FT that in an absolute sense, financing conditions remain “very favourable”. Several mid-sized leveraged buy-outs deals were also struck this week.The receptivity of the credit markets is a crucial issue. Before year’s end, bankers in the US are hoping to sell more than $300bn in high-yield bonds and loans, much of it to fund leveraged buyouts. Europe has several smaller LBO financing and refinancing deals in the pipeline.European stock markets went on the defensive after the deals were postponed. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 closed 0.9 per cent down and the FTSE 100 fell 0.7 per cent. US stocks, which plunged on Tuesday, were briefly affected, but recovered.Additional reporting by Martin Arnold
387;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-25T22:06:45Z;Leveraged finance;;Who is Chuck Prince dancing with now? Just two weeks ago the Citigroup boss reckoned the music was still playing for the credit-fuelled buy-out boom. But it gets a bit lonely on that dance floor when investors go on a massive buyers’ strike.The big banks threw in the towel on trying to place a combined $20bn or so of debt on Tuesday – part of the buy-out funding for the Chrysler and Alliance Boots deals. The banks will keep the loans on their books in the hope that, after a decent pause, investors’ nerves will rally.They could be waiting a while. Some of the leveraged loan paper trades at big discounts in the secondary market. From an investor’s perspective, catching a falling knife looks easier, right now, given the potential supply of leveraged loans and high-yield bonds coming down the pipe and the knock-on effects of the subprime mortgage mess.For the underwriters, this is a headache on several fronts. First, there are the potential mark downs on debt they have to keep. Second is the capital such funding ties up. Third is the credit exposure, which can be difficult to hedge out.The big banks, of course, will point to their large balance sheet and seasoned underwriting skills. And they may be right that it makes more sense to weather the storm than panic by shifting the paper into the market at firesale prices.But even indigestion, if it amounts to no more than that, can be painful. If the well-oiled machines that churn out the paper seize up, even for a short time, a backlog can build quickly given that commitments to fund buy-outs have still been coming in the front door. It may not quite be the day the music died but the tune is sounding a lot more doleful.
388;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-25T22:04:31Z;Private equity in Europe has ‘passed its peak’;;Europe’s booming private equity market has already peaked and deal volumes are expected to fall from a record €62bn in the second quarter, according to Candover, the UK-based fund.Marek Gumienny, managing director of Candover, said the tightening of credit markets meant private equity firms would put less debt on companies they buy, cutting the price of assets and reducing buy-out volumes.“People will need to negotiate more headroom in covenants, which is likely to mean lower leverage on deals and that would mean lower prices for assets,” said Mr Gumienny. “Everyone’s expectations will have to adjust to lower prices.”Credit market jitters meant European private equity deal volumes had “reached a peak of credit exuberance” in the second quarter, said Mr Gumienny. “In the US, where the problems are greatest, banks are shutting up shop. That is what we are hearing.”Citigroup, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse are among the big investment banks rumoured to be “closed to business” according to rival bankers.Big private equity deals in Europe have been hit by the choppy debt markets. Banks are struggling to sell the £9bn debt for the buy-out of Alliance Boots and there are financing concerns about the £2.4bn buy-out of EMI, the music group.Mr Gumienny said “a healthy correction” was inevitable after a period when “banks are lending you 10-year money with no repayments, no covenants and on very good terms”. But he said new conditions were “still very attractive”.“Until people have offloaded everything they have digested then the market will stall for a while,” he said. “Once they have offloaded everything – which will mean everyone taking some pain – then the market will return to where it was 9 to 12 months ago. It won’t stop deals being done.”Buy-out volumes in the three months to June reached €62bn in Europe, up 13 per cent from the previous quarter, mostly thanks to two big UK deals, which compensated for a drop in the number of deals, according to a study by Candover and Unquote.The biggest deals of the quarter were the £11bn Alliance Boots buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Stephano Pessina, Boots deputy chairman, and the £6bn merger of Saga and the AA by their three private equity owners. With 178 buy-outs in the second quarter, deal activity slowed by 17 per cent from the previous three-month period.The UK was by far the biggest private equity market by deal value, with buy-outs rising 250 per cent to €36bn in the second quarter.The UK accounted for four of the top five deals in the three-month period, including the buy-out of Bupa hospitals.
389;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-25T20:44:15Z;Global Overview: Chrysler news rattles equity markets;;"Global stock markets were rattled by fears that leveraged buy-out deals could dry up in the face of increasing investor aversion to risk.Equities were unsettled after banks dealing with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’ buy-out of Alliance Boots failed to sell £5bn of senior loans to fund the deal. Chrysler said it was suspending its $12bn auto loan deal and sweetening pricing terms on a further $6bn of loans.US stocks started out in fine form, jumping more than 100 points in the opening minutes after some upbeat earnings from Boeing and ConocoPhillips.Those early gains evaporated after news of the troubled takeover refinancings broke but stocks managed to rally back before the market closed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent, the S&P 500 was also up 0.5 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.3 per cent.European equities were hit by poor results from Siemens, the German conglomerate, and Volvo, the Swedish truckmaker. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended 0.9 per cent lower.On currency markets, risk aversion drove the dollar higher as weak US home sales data added to concerns about the housing market.Existing home sales for June fell unexpectedly sharply to 5.75m, the lowest for almost five years, adding to fears of a severe and prolonged housing slowdown. Earnings disappointments and profit warnings from corporate America have provided anecdotal evidence of the burgeoning downturn during the past few weeks. Warnings this month from DR Horton, the housebuilder, and Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, were joined on Tuesday by weak earnings from Countrywide, the mortgage lender, and USG, the building materials group. “The slowdown in the US housing market is turning uglier by the month,” said Dimitry Fleming at ING Financial Markets. “From the peak in February 2007, sales have now dropped 14 per cent.” The dollar rallied against the euro and the pound as investors cut their exposure to risk and yen-based carry trades, where the low-yielding Japanese currency is sold to fund higher-yielding purchases.Analysts said currency speculators, in unwinding some of their carry-trade positions, had sold the euro and sterling against the yen, which forced the dollar higher against both
currencies.The euro fell 0.6 per cent against the yen and 0.8 per cent against the dollar, while sterling fell 0.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively.“A move that started with a weak dollar had the effect of helping the US currency against the euro in a classic tail wagging the dog move,” said Alan Ruskin at RBS Greenwhich Capital.The dollar climbed 0.2 per cent against the yen.Gold, which hit an 11-week high on Tuesday, fell 1.7 per cent as the dollar’s recovery prompted profit taking.Ashraf Laidi at CMC Markets suggested European central banks had stepped up their gold sales to meet annual quotas set up under the Central Bank Gold Agreement.“The four-year agreement states that central banks can sell up to 500 tonnes of gold per year,” Mr Laidi said.He added: “Only two-thirds of the quota is estimated to have been sold this year, allowing central banks seven weeks to meet their quota.”Other metals were weaker as caution on commodities markets heightened after the US data.Copper fell on fears that a slowdown in the US housing market would damp demand for the metal, used in plumbing and wiring.U.S. crude prices jumped 3.2 per cent to close at $75.88 a barrel after a big fall in weekly inventories.Credit markets were further shaken as the latest monthly performance data on subprime mortgage securities, which show delinquency rates, where borrowers fail to make payments as required, were rapidly increasing.Benchmark ABX indices, which are created every six months to track the credit risk of loans made in the previous six-month period, hit record lows on Wednesday following the data.Government bonds prices were a touch firmer. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was a little lower at 4.90 per cent, after earlier falling below 4.9 per cent, a seven-week low, while the yield on the 10-year Bund had fallen to 4.40 per cent."
390;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-25T19:54:13Z;Credit gloom intensifies after failed loan deals;;The gloom in the credit markets intensified on Wednesday as Chrysler postponed a $12bn loan deal and banks failed to sell £5bn ($10.2bn) of senior loans to fund the leveraged buy-out of Alliance Boots.Bankers raising $20bn for the private equity buy-out of Chrysler Group from DaimleyChrysler were forced to postpone the sale of $12bn in loans for the car group.Bankers still intend to raise a further $6bn in loans for Chrysler’s finance arm, albeit with higher interest rates but an additional $2bn loan for the financial company was cancelled last week.The bankers are planning to fund $10bn of the auto company’s loans themselves and market the deal to investors later, said a person familiar with the situation.The remaining $2bn of funding for the auto company will be provided by Cerberus Capital Management and Daimler.People close to the Boots financing said at least £1.75bn of more junior debt would be sold to investors at significant discounts.The eight banks involved in underwriting the deal would keep equal shares of the £5bn of senior loans on their books. These are led by Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Unicredit and include Barclays Capital, Citigroup, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and Royal Bank of Scotland.The £1bn in second lien debt will see its interest margin increased by 25 basis points to 425bp and will be sold at a discount of 4 per cent, meaning that investors get £1 of debt for 96 pence.The more junior £750m in mezzanine loans will also see its margin lifted by 50bp to 650bp, although the extra is payable in more debt rather than cash, which has less of an impact on the company. The mezzanine will be sold at 95p in the pound.Banks receive fees of 2-2.5 per cent for such debt deals, so the discounts on the pieces they are selling will leave them with losses on this deal.One banker involved was keen to point out that they make fees from other areas of the leveraged buy-out process. Private equity sources point out that the banks have had many months of high fees in booming credit markets before the recent turmoil hit.One person close to Boots said the banks could have sold the senior debt but that the discounts they would have had to offer would have caused them much greater pain, given the larger size of those loans.“The fact they are happy to take this debt on to their books supports what investors say about it being a good company and a good credit,” the person said. “If they didn’t like the company or were worried about its prospects they would have taken their losses now.”The problems surrounding the two deals underscore how risk-averse investors have become in recent weeks in the face of a $300bn US pipeline of high-yield bond and loan issuance and problems in the US subprime mortgage market. Much of the pending debt is to fund leveraged buy-outs,Edward Marrinan, credit strategist at JPMorgan, said terms agreed for some buy-out deals in the pipeline may not be flexible, meaning that banks could be forced to hold more debt on their balance sheets unless credit market conditions improve and investors return to the market.“This will put pressure on underwriters, which could affect appetite later in the cycle to continue to provide financing for transactions.”Almost 30 bond or loan deals have been pulled since late June, according to Barings Asset Management, and until the market for corporate bonds shows signs of stabilising, the pipeline of deals threatens to give credit markets a serious case of heartburn.The rapid withdrawal of liquidity has had a significant effect on market sentiment but it remains unclear whether it marks the start of a downturn in the corporate credit cycle. At this juncture, corporate defaults are at record lows and economic fundamentals remain sound.Given that backdrop, some credit investors are starting to ask: when do we pile back in? “The market is starting to look attractive,”says Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos, but he adds that “there is no rush to get involved at the moment”.As the pipeline continues to bulge, Mr Kastner said: “It’s tough to step in and catch that falling knife.”Some analysts and investors say in spite of the fact that credit risk has not been priced so cheaply since the blow-out in spreads that followed the downgrades of Ford and General Motors in May 2005, investors are likely to remain reticent about piling back in until they see signs of stability.Most investors choose to express views on the debt markets through the credit derivative indices. These provide a type of insurance against the non-payment of corporate debt. They also enable investors to take on credit exposures quickly.As a result, these indices have become the best barometers of risk appetite in the corporate credit market. The crossover indices, which track companies that are on the cusp of junk status, have experienced the largest swings in recent weeks.The cost of buying protection on the CDX Crossover index in the US remained above an annual rate of $300,000 to insure $10m of debt, and has more than doubled since early June.Its European cousin, the iTraxx Crossover, has had similar moves, jumping from about €190,000 at the start of June to almost €370,000 – or a spread of 370bp – at its highest this week. Gerald Lucas, senior investment adviser at Deutsche Bank, said investors looking to exploit potential hedge fund losses were part of the reason for the move.“Many people are frontrunning the expected deleveraging of hedge fund positions as they face margin calls and the risk of redemptions.”Even the indices of investment-grade corporate debt have come under sustained pressure.The spread on the CDX US investment-grade index is above 50bp, a level not seen since November 2005.Stability, let alone a reversal in sentiment, could be some time in coming.In Europe, Geraud Charpin, analyst at UBS, outlined in a note this week three scenarios for the iTraxx Crossover ranging from a worst case scenario of 578bp to a best case of 377bp for where spreads will peak.But analysts at JPMorgan are bullish in spite of, by their own admission, stepping in too early when suggesting the 250bp-270bp range for the iTraxx Crossover was the point to buy.“We are still committed to adding risk to our portfolios. We held off from doing this last month but feel compelled to step in and buy selectively here, particularly in high yield credits that we like fundamentally.”
391;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
392;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-25T19:05:15Z;Marston’s hit by short selling in weak London;;Marston’s was targeted by short sellers Wednesday amid talk that the pub company had been hit hard by the flooding in central and western England.After heavy trading, its shares closed 4 per cent lower at 392½p amid suggestions that the number of outlets affected ran into three figures. Sources close to the company were unable to say exactly how many pubs had been hit but said it was not as many as suggested.Broker KBC Peel Hunt said Wednesday’s fall was an overreaction. It pointed out that Marston’s – the former Wolverhampton & Dudley – would be insured against loss of business and that flooding had affected a tiny part of its estate.“The effect is clearly temporary and does not affect the validity of the Marston’s proposition, nor its underlying asset-backed value, which we continue to rate at 500p,” it said.In the wider market, there was no respite for leading shares. Down 1.9 per cent on Tuesday, the FTSE 100 lost 44.4 points, or 0.7 per cent, to finish at 6,454.3.The FTSE 250 dropped 168.1 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 11,415.9.Traders pinned Wednesday’s weakness on further worries about the credit and US housing markets. DaimlerChrysler postponed a $12bn (£5.8bn) bond, while the banks financing the buy-out of Alliance Boots were unable to sell £5bn of bonds.British Energy, the nuclear power company, was the biggest faller, losing 5.2 per cent to 482½p amid talk that one of its largest shareholders was liquidating its position. An alternative theory was that hedge funds that bought stock when the UK government placed 400m shares at 520p were facing margin calls and were selling out.Barclays was also under pressure, falling 3.2 per cent to 715p. Traders said the fall reflected fears that its unpopular bid for ABN Amro might succeed.Those concerns were prompted by rumours that a mystery investor was trying to acquire a large chunk of Fortis through the options market with the intention of using the shares to block the Belgian bank’s involvement in a rival bid for RBS.On the upside, GlaxoSmithKline rose 2.3 per cent to £12.75 after results impressed and the drug company doubled its share buyback to £12bn.J Sainsbury dipped 1.2 per cent to 583½p after a report claimed 10 per cent shareholder Robert Tchenguiz would not back a 600p-a-share offer for the group.Deutsche Bank remained positive, increasing its target price to 650p from 525p. The broker said it was time for Sainsbury’s management to “think the unthinkable” and crystalise the value of its freehold property portfolio.ICI, the speciality chemicals company, fell 0.7 per cent to 602p. Traders were surprised by the fall as it suggested that Akzo Nobel, which has bid 600p, would not return with an improved offer. Akzo has until August 9 to make another bid.Among the mid caps, Carphone Warehouse climbed 4.1 per cent to 353p on rumours of a bid from Vodafone, up 0.2 per cent to 156.3p. Less excitable traders thought the rise owed more to short sellers buying back positions ahead of this morning’s trading update, which is tipped to impress and feature news of an Apple iPhone contract.Sports Direct International rallied 4.8 per cent to 154p, recouping some of Tuesday’s 23 per cent drop. After the market closed, the sports-equipment retailer said it had repurchased 2.4m shares.London Stock Exchange eased 1.2 per cent to £13.79 after a block of 11.2m shares, or 5.6 per cent of the company, changed hands at £13.79. The trade was thought to be a hedge fund swapping a derivative position for shares so that it could vote on the LSE’s €1.6bn offer for Borsa Italiana. The vote is due to be held on August 8.G4S firmed up 0.8 per cent amid talk the manned guarding and electronic security company could be a takeover target for a private equity group such as Permira.G4S has been in focus since Centaurus Capital, an activist investor, emerged with a 5 per cent holding in April.Invensys, the controls and automation group, eased 4.7 per cent to 394¾p after Siemens, a rumoured bidder, announced a $6.3bn acquisition of Dade Behring.
393;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-24T20:07:28Z;Boots loan deal under question amid credit fears;;Players in Europe’s loan markets are awaiting with bated breath the outcome of discussions between banks, investors and the new private equity owners of the pharmacy chain, Alliance Boots, about the sale of its £9bn of debt.The question in many minds is: must this deal be done at any price?One of the biggest obstacles for the banks – led by Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and UniCredit’s HVB arm – is that investors who think the answer is “yes” are focusing on how to profit, or at least not lose money from that fact. According to those close to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Stephano Pessina, the new owners of Boots, this is the banks’ problem.The banks have some leeway to sweeten the deal to draw investors in. This is strictly limited to increases of 0.25 per cent on the cash interest payable on two more senior loans and extra “payment in kind” interest on the more junior mezzanine loan. In cash terms, the extra cost to the company from this is limited to £15m per year or £122.5m over the life of the debt.If the debt is discounted for sale, this will come directly out of the banks’ fees, say people close to Boots, which for such a deal are typically worth 2-2.5 per cent of the value of the debt. Current talk of discounts between 1 per cent and 2 per cent across the different slices of debt means the banks will see a good part of their fees disappear, but will not yet be looking at losses.The banks are thought to be in talks about the amount of fees they are willing to give up to offload debt they are committed to providing. They are thought to be trying to get KKR and Mr Pessina to share some of the pain.The new owners will not be moved. “There is a legal contract with the underwriters that defines what does and does not take place. There is no scope to change the terms,” one person close to them says.“Equally, when the banks were selling all deals at par, taking full fees and making millions, we didn’t get to change the terms either.”It is the size of the Boots loans in a market with restricted liquidity and the fact that it is entirely in sterling, making it more expensive for many euro-based investors, that is making it difficult to shift.The size also suggests the banks will have to sell – even if they think the debt is an attractive investment, their credit committees are unlikely to be happy with the concentration of risk on a single company. The problem is, the less liquid the market and the more the banks need to offload the debt the worse it is likely to perform in the secondary market.If this means the banks end up stuck with the debt, it will affect their appetite for underwriting other leveraged buy-outs. For a firm such as KKR, which has huge debt deals pending for other companies and ambitions for other buy-outs, having banks able to underwrite new debt is crucial.This does not mean they are ready to give anything away. “We have a fiduciary duty to each individual deal,” the person close to Boots says. “Obviously there is a broader picture, but what can we do?”“Yes, we want the Boots debt deal to go well. It is a barometer for the market and the market is now volatile, which is going to affect banks’ ability to syndicate the debt. But there is a legal contract in place and nothing in that can change.”
394;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-24T18:10:44Z;ICI defence;;Time rarely passes so slowly as when waiting for the phone to ring. For ICI, there was no reprieve yesterday. Akzo Nobel has until August 9, under a Takeover Panel-imposed deadline, to make a formal bid and discussion of the issue was off the agenda as it released a decent set of second quarter numbers. Growth by acquisition is still the plan but the message was clear that this will be “in a financially disciplined manner”.That should not weaken the ICI board’s resolve to hold out for a fair price after rejecting the initial 600p a share approach. Recent experience points to the value of resistance. J Sainsbury, Marks & Spencer and the London Stock Exchange have all been vindicated by strong share price performance since rebuffing early suitors. For Alliance Boots, holding out eventually produced a bid 14 per cent above the initial £10 offer. Even if there is not another buyer, it can pay to be tough. Intransigence from BPB forced Saint–Gobain to lift its price by 8 per cent in 2005. Kidde was rewarded for negotiating hard with United Technologies.The job of a target’s board is not just to elicit the best available price above standalone value but also to assess if this level captures the value a deal creates. Analyst valuations of ICI were in the 450p to 500p a share range before news of the deal broke. But based on the group’s business plan, a discounted cash flow valuation points to 550p a share. For what is arguably the best deal available to Akzo in the coatings market, it should be prepared to pay a premium equivalent to the full value of cost synergies – that is, the maximum price without destroying value. Given the good fit of the two businesses in Europe, these could be worth as much as 120p. If the Dutch group is not prepared to pay up, ICI’s board should have the confidence to run the business in its own time.
395;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-24T15:10:49Z;View of the day: Financing buy-outs;;The current difficulties in financing leveraged buy-outs, such as that for Alliance Boots, could have far-reaching implications for equities, Daniel Stillit, analyst at UBS says.“European credit markets cannot at the moment comfortably support an £11bn LBO,” he says.“Stocks which have been traded as attractive on an LBO basis are less likely to benefit from the private equity ‘put’ or LBO valuation ‘floor’.“Our analysis suggests this group would include Adidas, Deutsche Post, Experian, Reed Elsevier, Smith & Nephew and TNT.”But Mr Stillit believes corporate merger and acquisition deals may flourish. “Corporates currently have debt capacity and are investment-grade credits.” he says. “Such corporate buyers may no longer be outbid by private equity.”An indication of this might come from whether the auction of Siemens’ VDO car parts business is won by Continental or Blackstone.Mr Stillit is optimistic that large LBOs will re-emerge. “We still see the economic/governance case for LBOs as compelling and therefore expect a resumption of activity when the credit markets stabilise.“Record amounts of private equity capital are being raised alongside new listed private equity vehicles,” he says. “This still needs to be deployed.”
396;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-23T21:20:44Z;There is still some life left in CLOs;;"The deepening turmoil in credit markets has not ended all life in the European market for the complex vehicles that account for a large proportion of demand for leveraged loans.Four new collateralised loan obligations have come to market in the past week even as banks have been unwinding pools of the loans that finance private equity buy-outs which were being built up for other potential deals.CLOs buy up portfolios of leveraged loans then issue bonds with varying credit ratings and risk profiles to fund these pools.Since about February, the spreads or interest rates on CLO bonds have been widening as fears about the US subprime mortgage crisis have spilled over into different types of structured vehicles.Uncertainty about where spreads were heading has hurt demand for CLOs, while some hedge funds, such as Australian group Basis, are thought to have been dumping CLO paper on the markets.The underlying loan markets are suffering with a number of planned refinancings being pulled and in Europe, at least, most activity on hold until the fate of the £9bn ($18.5bn) of Alliance Boots funding is known.The market for new CLOs has almost entirely seized up in recent weeks.Last week there were deals from both established and newer managers successfully get away.Morgan Stanley Investment Management sold its second CLO through Citigroup; hedge fund CQS sold its third through Lehman Brothers; Elgin Capital sold its fourth deal through BNP Paribas; and Avoca sold its eighth deal.These deals bring to about €7.4bn ($10.2bn) the volume of CLOs in the past 45 days, according to S&P LCD, the market information service.There are still 23 deals valued at about €8.8bn in the pipeline waiting to be sold, it added.The pricing of CLO debt on new deals can still vary dramatically, although all spreads are drifting outwards.Recent research from JPMorgan estimates that the average cost of all CLO bonds has risen by 6 basis points to 50.5bp over risk-free rates in the past 45 days.But bankers say that some of the CLO debt among lower spread deals is being sold at a hefty discount to face value, which helps to maintain the impression that spreads are lower than they really are."
397;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-20T19:18:52Z;Boots debt package cost leaps;;The private equity owners of Alliance Boots and their banks have been forced to extend discussions on the debt package to fund the acquisition into next week after failing to reach agreement with investors.The debt now looks set to cost about £250m more than expected for the record £11bn leveraged buy-out, according to people familiar with the terms.According to one person close to the deal, the debt will now cost about £161m more in total interest payments for the company.There will also be an additional £85m in upfront fees to investors, much of which is likely to be borne by the investment banks arranging the deal.The Boots deal is seen as an important barometer of sentiment in the European leveraged loan markets.Many investors are thought to be considering lower bids for Boots debt than they would have done just six weeks ago, or not bidding at all because they believe they will be able to pick up the debt more cheaply in the secondary market.The FT reported this week that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Stefano Pessina, the billionaire chairman of the company, would have to improve the terms on the £9bn of loans it was seeking to fund the deal.The deepening crisis in the US subprime mortgage market, which provides home loans to riskier borrowers, has severely rattled debt markets in recent weeks.On Friday, Springer Science+ Business, which is owned by Cinven and Candover, formally withdrew a planned refinancing that would have paid a €610m (£411m) dividend to the owners. Meanwhile, Tata Steel, the owners of Corus, launched a large loan deal this week, which some investors described as aggressively priced for present conditions.The margin on the largest part of the Boots deal, the £5.05bn senior loan, is expected to rise to 3 per cent, from 2.75 per cent, according to one person close to the deal.There would also be discounts of 1 per cent for investors on the face value of the debt. For KKR this means an additional cost of £12.625m annually in interest payments and £50m in upfront discounts.The margin on the £1bn second-lien loan is expected to rise by 25bp to 4.25 per cent, costing £2.5m annually, with fees of 2 per cent, or £20m.Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Unicredit are leading the debt sale and a number of other banks are involved as bookrunners.
398;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-19T19:20:32Z;Private equity to pay higher price for done deals;;Private equity firms can now be in no doubt that they are going to have to pay more to fund the debt for buy-out deals they have already sealed.This week alone has seen two of the biggest deals on either side of the Atlantic – buy-outs of Alliance Boots and Chrysler – forced to increase the premium, or interest rates, on loans they are trying to sell. Bankers in a flurry other deals have had to act likewise.Late on Tuesday it emerged that Chrysler was increasing the interest rate on a $2bn second-lien loan – part of its $22bn in debt financing – by 1 percentage point as investors used their re-acquired power to demand better terms.This means it is going to cost the US carmaker, which is being bought from DaimlerChrysler by Cerberus, the private equity group, an extra $20m annually to service this debt, plus whatever it has to give away in discounts, which could be another $20m up front.On the same day it also emerged something similar was going on at Alliance Boots, the record UK leveraged buy-out, which is seeking some £9bn worth of loans from investors.The changes are likely to cost anywhere between an extra £15m and £31m annually, according to investors’ expectations, plus some more in terms of fees.However, it is not yet certain that even this will be enough to get the buyers in. One London-based investor said he thought the Boots loan had little chance of getting the commitments it wants from investors by a tentative deadline on Friday.“They have got to do something – either withdraw the deal for now or come up with something that will be a material change to what they are currently offering,” said the investor, who declined to be named.One person close to the company said that it had seriously considered the option of delaying the financing until October and some in the market think that is still a possibility. Others say that would send out the wrong signals to a market that is watching the Boots deals closely to gauge investor appetite.However, the pain for private equity is pleasure to many long-term investors who have seen their potential returns squeezed by the competition for debt that had helped drive ever-more aggressive structures with ever-tighter margins in recent months.“This is good for the market and hopefully it will last,” says one European structured finance manager.Higher premiums are just one aspect of the extra restrictions that sponsors of leveraged buy-outs are facing again.Borrowers are also being forced to add back covenants to what had been proposed as “cov-lite” deals and to offer discounts to face value on new loans – commonly 0.5 to 1 per cent – which act like a kind of acceptance fee for investors.Such fees also help to allay concerns among investors that loans are no longer guaranteed to trade strongly in the secondary market after deals have settled. In the US, the average price of a loan in the secondary market dropped below par value a few weeks ago and in Europe it is heading that way.This is in sharp contrast to the past year or so which has commonly seen the vast majority of loans trading between 1 and 2 per cent higher than par value.European markets have been more on edge since a loan for ProSieben, the German media group, was released for trading in June. The deal had been oversubscribed and the margin on it had been cut during the marketing phase.But once trading began, the value of the loans dropped in the face of heavy selling by people who had been happy to hold it a week before. That was the first sign that liquidity was beginning to dry up and introduced concerns about broad secondary market strength and the value of loan portfolios.Since then, a deal for Maxeda, the Dutch DIY chain, has been pulled, while one for Springer Science + Business was sent back to the drawing board after investors found that the structure, pricing and level of dividend the company’s private equity owners wanted to take out was too aggressive.Other deals in Europe that are being repriced or restructured include those from Selecta, Terreal and Biomet.In the US, investors have been avoiding buying riskier structures such as covenant-lite loans and so-called Pik-toggle loans and bonds – which allow companies to make interest payments in the form of new debt.Among deals to face difficulties were Thomson Learning, which was forced to restructure the terms of bonds and loans for its leveraged buy-out, and US Foodservice’s $5.3bn bond and loan offering, which was initially downsized and later pulled.Eric Tutterow, analyst at Fitch Ratings, said investors were now growing concerned that large bridge loans to companies whose deals are being restructured or cancelled could result in tightening credit conditions. For the six deals that have been cancelled since the beginning of June, analysts estimate that a total of nearly $13bn of debt could be held by the underwriters for the foreseeable future.Too many of these so-called hung deals will quickly cut banks’ appetites for underwriting debt for new buy-outs. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley are on the hook for $22bn between them in Chrysler debt alone if they cannot shift it.Large leveraged buy-outs expected in the coming months include $25bn of loans to finance the buy-out of TXU, $16bn of loans and $8bn of bonds for First Data and $19bn of loans and $2.6bn of bonds for Clear Channel Communications.But it is not all gloom and doom. Orangina, the French soft drinks group owned by Blackstone and Lion Capital, this week raised €192m in loans with only one of the normal three maintenance covenants that protect lenders against a deterioration in the business.
399;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-18T21:46:08Z;Trustees await approach for talks;;Trustees to the J Sainsbury pension scheme have yet to receive an approach about talks from Delta Two, the Qatari-backed consortium that has made a tentative £12bn offer for the parent company.However, in the months since an consortium led by private equity investors CVC made its own approach to the company, it has become clear that no highly leveraged bidder can complete an acquisition, hostile or otherwise, without offering substantial security to the pension scheme.The Pension Regulator this year issued guidance to trustees about how they should react to corporate transactions that result in a significant reduction in security to the plan sponsor’s covenant.This came after the CVC-led consortium then seeking to buy Sainsbury and another led by KKR, which bid, successfully, for Alliance Boots, appeared prepared to proceed with their transactions without making substantial upfront contributions to the pension plan.The Sainsbury trustees were seeking up to £3bn to provide additional security for the scheme under the buy-out plans, which involved using the company’s entire property portfolio as collateral.The last reported deficit for the company showed a deficit in that scheme of £447m.Because Delta Two is domiciled outside Europe, trustees may become concerned that the regulator’s powers to compel contributions to the scheme in future years may be impaired.Any uncertainty about a new owner would force trustees to review the investment profile of the fund, pushing the fund into more conservative assets. This would have a direct impact on the calculation of the deficit and therefore sponsor contributions.
400;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-16T21:55:12Z;Maxeda loans pulled over credit concerns;;Citigroup and ABN Amro have pulled the sale of €1.1bn ($1.51bn) of loans for Maxeda, a private equity-owned Dutch do-it-yourself retailer, after attracting insufficient demand in spite of improving the terms of the deal, illustrating the change in sentiment for leveraged finance.Loan markets in Europe and the US are beginning to suffer pain from the credit turmoil sparked by the US subprime mortgage crisis. Secondary market loan values have fallen and several deals are being delayed or restructured with less aggressive terms.Europe will face a big test of investor appetite this week with commitments expected from investors for the £9bn ($18.3bn) of debt for Alliance Boots, also owned by KKR. Many investors expect this deadline to slip and some of the terms to be changed.In the US, the market is suffering from oversupply with a record $215bn of leveraged loans to be sold before the end of the year.Citigroup and ABN guaranteed Maxeda an equal share of the funding, so the private equity consortium led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts that owns the business gets its financing, but the two banks hold all the debt.People close to the deal were on Monday keen to stipulate it was not in the interests of the banks to pursue it in current market conditions, although it is far from certain when the banks will be able to offload the debt.“There is no impact for Maxeda of this decision to postpone syndication,” the company said. “Maxeda financing is in place and the company is focused on running its business as usual.”The deal was designed to refinance debt from when the company was taken private in 2004, which included more costly high-yield bonds.The new financing, which had originally been cov-lite, meaning it carried fewer restrictions that help to protect lenders from a downturn in the business, failed to attract sufficient demand in spite of having covenants added and being offered at a discount.
401;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-16T21:00:47Z;Private equity takes on its critics;;The private equity industry will on Tuesday unveil its first attempt to stem the rising tide of political criticism with the publication of a review proposing greater financial transparency and improvements to corporate governance which could include appointing independent directors.Sir David Walker, the former chairman of both Morgan Stanley International and the Securities and Investments Board appointed by the buy-out industry to propose a code of conduct, will trigger a fierce debate with Tuesday’s consultation paper.Most controversially, he is expected to float the idea of buyout firms appointing external, non-executive directors to the boards of some companies bought by private equity.His review is the industry’s first response to criticism, particularly in the UK, where it has been accused of being too secretive after taking over household name companies, such as Alliance Boots and the AA breakdown service.Sir David’s 50-page report – presented at the London Stock Exchange – will start a three-month feedback process. Final conclusions later this year will create a code of conduct to be imposed on a “comply or explain” basis.The Walker report is being closely watched by buy-out firms and other industry bodies around the world, such as the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, which are waiting for its conclusions before pursuing their own reviews.One senior UK buy-out executive said Sir David needed to be ambitious to maintain his credibility and see off calls for stricter regulation. “If the industry doesn’t move first, then it could be pushed much faster than it wants to go,” the executive said.Sir David – appointed by the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association – is expected to recommend more disclosure about the performance of buy-out funds. While avoiding specific proposals, he will urge regular communication with staff at portfolio companies.He will suggest the code of conduct should only apply to buy-out firms that have acquired companies above a certain size, equivalent to the FTSE 250 index, to be measured by the value of the acquired company and the size of its workforce.Making the case for more transparency, Sir David is understood to recommend much greater disclosure on the debt structures of portfolio companies, including repayment schedules and covenants for loans.But the idea of non-executive directors with experience of the relevant sector being added to portfolio company boards could provoke the biggest backlash.“The industry will absolutely hate this,” said Darren Redmayne, managing director of Close Brothers, the UK investment banking boutique.The code of conduct is likely to follow the model set by the Takeover Panel, with a board of trustees constantly reviewing the rules.
402;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-12T22:18:01Z;Hands drops bid for stake in Boots;;Guy Hands has been forced to ditch an unusual offer to invest £250m in Alliance Boots that the private equity investor made after his firm Terra Firma lost out to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in a bid battle for the pharmacies chain.The record £11bn buy-out of Boots – the first of a FTSE 100 company – is being closely watched as a barometer of investor appetite for leveraged buy-out deals after credit markets turned jittery in recent weeks.The withdrawal of Mr Hands’s surprise offer means JPMorgan, the bank charged with syndicating about £1.3bn of equity in Boots, has to sell more shares than it expected.The Boots deal does not hinge on selling all the shares, as seven banks have provided bridge equity, committing themselves to buying any shares not placed by KKR and Stephano Pessina, the Boots deputy chairman who is backing the buy-out.Senior executives familiar with the deal on Thursday night stressed the equity syndication – the biggest of its kind in Europe – was going smoothly.“I am very relaxed. We have had calls from lots of interested investors,” said a senior executive. “We sold £900m in the first few weeks without talking to many people, as the Take-over Panel restricted us.“We have £400m left to sell and a list of names who are interested that will exceed it. I expect it to be done in a week or two.”Terra Firma has never taken a minority stake in another private equity firm’s buy-out. But Mr Hands, who lost out in the battle for Boots in April, called JPMorgan last month to offer to buy a minority stake in the retailer. The bank informed Dominic Murphy, the KKR partner running the deal, who accepted.This month, while a confidentiality agreement was being drawn up and after KKR had given some details on its strategy for Boots, Mr Hands told JPMorgan Terra Firma investors had blocked him from buying the stake. His investors were unwilling to invest in Boots via Terra Firma when they were being invited to invest directly.
403;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-11T20:30:33Z;Alliance Boots’ chief and retail head quit;;Richard Baker and Scott Wheway, the two most senior retail executives at Alliance Boots, said they were quitting the retail and wholesale drugs distributor just three weeks after it became the first FTSE 100 company to fall into private equity hands.Mr Baker, chief executive of Alliance Boots, and Mr Wheway, retail director, resigned following discussions with Stefano Pessina, the executive chairman, and new owners Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, over their future roles. The duo were the most senior executives at Boots the Chemist when it merged with Mr Pessina’s Alliance Unichem less than a year ago. Both had been offered jobs – with private equity-style salaries – by KKR.It is thought Mr Baker resigned because of the lack of autonomy he would have had under Mr Pessina, who owns 50 per cent of the voting rights and chairs the board.The departures will come as unsettling news to many Boots employees, who have gone through a merger and a takeover in less than a year.In the run-up to the £11.1bn buy-out, completed in June, both KKR and Mr Pessina, then deputy executive chairman and largest shareholder, told staff that they wanted to keep the management team intact.Mr Pessina, Mr Baker, Mr Wheway and Alex Gourlay, the healthcare director who is taking over as head of Boots, addressed staff at Boots’ headquarters in Nottingham on Wednesday.Mr Baker told the Financial Times: “Stefano is a gentleman. He has been good to his word with me every step of the way, and I am confident about the future of the company. And I have looked everyone in the eye in Nottingham and told them that.”KKR is not appointing a replacement chief executive. However, Marco Pagni, who has worked with Mr Pessina on a number of deals and is group legal counsel, has added the role of chief administrative officer to his brief and will take on some of Mr Baker’s tasks, according to insiders.Mr Baker, who made £6.5m on his shares and options from the KKR deal, will receive a further pay-out of an estimated £2m including his pension. It is thought that he would like another role leading a company or a public organisation.Mr Wheway decided to quit because he did not want to be tied into Alliance Boots for five years. At 40, the former Tesco executive is hankering after a chief executive postTheir departures mean that no former Boots directors will sit on the new board. Dominic Murphy, a KKR partner, and Ornella Barra, Mr Pessina’s long-term partner and director of wholesale, will sit on the board, alongside George Fairweather, the finance director, Steve Duncan, who heads the community pharmacies, and Mr Pagni.
404;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-11T19:10:08Z;There’s only room for one big boss at Alliance Boots;;When Alliance UniChem merged with Boots a year ago, the strong suspicion was that Stefano Pessina would be a back-seat driver, while Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman, and Richard Baker, chief executive, would be up front, steering round the obstacles thrown up by analysts, investors and the media. Mr Pessina’s unusual position was recognised with the title of executive deputy chairman and reinforced by his stake of 15 per cent in the enlarged group and the presence of his partner and drug wholesaling expert, Ornella Barra, as an executive director.Wednesday’s boardroom reshuffle, following the takeover of Alliance Boots by Mr Pessina and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, therefore has a certain inevitability about it. The board is entirely composed of KKR and Alliance UniChem representatives and the operating committee contains only a couple of Boots executives. Sir Nigel has, of course, gone, but so have Mr Baker and Scott Wheway, managing director of the Boots arm.Mr Pessina had underlined to Mr Baker when KKR first approached Alliance Boots that he hoped to retain the management. But these changes are less brutal than they look. The Italian has fulfilled his moral obligation by offering both Mr Baker and Mr Wheway the chance to stay, and their decisions to quit are understandable.Mr Wheway must have a better chance of a chief executive position elsewhere if he does not shackle himself to Mr Pessina and KKR for five or more years. For Mr Baker, the idea of running Alliance Boots out of the public limelight probably had some attractions, given the buffeting that management received after the merger. The rewards on offer would also have put the £6.5m he will realise from share options, plus additional contractual payments, in the shade.But the buy-out crystallised Mr Pessina’s dominance. Under an executive chairman with 50 per cent of the voting rights. Mr Baker would have had to commit to a five-year stint pushing through decisions taken by Mr Pessina and KKR. If he had any lingering doubts about the decision to leave, then the fact that nobody was named as chief executive in the new management structure should dispel them.X-rated at the LSEThe London Stock Exchange’s decision to open a specialist market, with lower standards of disclosure and governance, on which hedge funds and private equity funds can be traded is brave.It could open London to more charges – particularly from the US – that it is dropping standards to attract business. If a fund blows up, it could tarnish the reputations of the LSE and the City.In reality, however, funds already have the option of going elsewhere in Europe – to Amsterdam, for instance – because there is no “directive-minimum” market in the UK, unless you count Aim, where a few have floated. So it makes sense for the LSE to try to attract some of that business, in the process creating a secondary alternative to the Financial Services Authority’s proposed new listing standards for investment entities.The LSE’s outline plan has enough health warnings to frighten off retail investors and worry even those professionals addicted to extreme investing – variable liquidity, concentrated risks, high leverage, “sophisticated” structures. This may not be enough to satisfy all those who worry about mis-labelling – and therefore possible mis-selling – of the City brand. “London’s directive-minimum market” for funds sounds dully reliable. The LSE’s official title – the Specialist Fund Market – has a rather impressive ring to it. Calling it the “adults-only” market would give a better idea of the risks involved.Kids shrink their legacyWarren Buffett’s aphorism that you should leave your kids enough money to do anything but not enough to do nothing has been given a strange twist here. A high proportion of children are inheriting the family firm – and doing nothing with it. Not “owner-managers” but “owner-layabouts”.According to research out today from the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics and McKinsey, by handing their businesses down to their children, entrepreneurs may be sustaining a long “tail” of underperforming companies and holding back the UK’s score for good management practice compared with, say, the US. Other factors may play a part – notably low skill levels in the UK, both among managers and non-managers – but the CEP/McKinsey figures on family managers are striking: whereas in the US, only 2.6 per cent of family-owned firms are run by a chief executive selected by primogeniture, in the UK, the figure is 9.1 per cent.Correcting this bias towards poor management – which offsets positive influences on UK companies such as labour flexibility and fierce competition – is difficult. Scrapping inheritance tax relief on the transfer of large family businesses would help. That would echo Mr Buffett’s campaign against repeal of the estate tax, the US equivalent. But even then, an ageing owner would have to be persuaded that the super-efficient management of, say, a private equity firm was preferable to the benevolent neglect of a beloved son or daughter. In other words, this is a problem with a familial rather than a fiscal solution.To comment, visit www.ft.com/lombard
405;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-10T18:27:19Z;Danone buys Numico;;It is not quite a bolt from the blue, since the two names have been linked in the past. But Danone’s purchase of baby food group Numico is hardly the bolt-on acquisition the French food group talked of last week. Danone has taken the €5.3bn it will receive from Kraft for its biscuits division and made the most expensive large-cap deal in the recent history of the consumer goods sector.At a 44 per cent premium to the average share price of the past three months, the €55-a-share agreed offer represents an enterprise value of €13.4bn, a 22 times multiple of this year’s consensus earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. That compares with the 21 times ebitda Reckitt Benckiser paid for Boots Healthcare International, or the 19 times Procter & Gamble paid for Gillette in 2005.Is Numico worth it? It fits with Danone’s focus on health, adds a third arm in fast-growing markets and brings complementary strengths in dairy products and infant milk formula. Yet it will largely be run as an independent unit within the enlarged group, hence the low ambitions for synergies: the €60m of annual cost savings targeted is just 2.3 per cent of Numico’s sales. Taxed and discounted, that is only worth about €440m, a mere dent in the €3.8bn premium Danone is paying. In fact, the deal will not meet its cost of capital for at least the first five years, even if Numico continues to increase sales at its projected rate of 10 to 12 per cent, and delivers operating margins of 18 per cent.Maintaining Numico’s recent strong performance will be no easy task, though. Danone has no experience in clinical nutrition, which contributes just under a third of Numico’s sales, nor of selling baby food outside its home market of France. And it must integrate the business without the help of Numico’s chief executive and chief financial officer, the chief architects of the Dutch group’s turnround. Given Danone’s poor record of acquisitions – its foray into US water at the start of the decade ended in write-downs and an eventual sale – this is a very big and costly bet to make.

407;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-02T18:45:16Z;Viability of CLOs set for big loan issue challenge;;At the height of the first junk-rated debt crisis in 1989, RJR Nabisco sold what remained until very recently the biggest ever slug of high-yield bonds.But what is less well remembered is that the company and its buy-out backers, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, raised only about $4bn from its $6.1bn bond issue as market turmoil forced it to offer much of the debt at a hefty discount.For many, the parallels between then and now are striking. And with a slew of leveraged buyout-related loans and bonds due to hit the markets in coming months, the massed ranks of private equity groups and investment banks will be hoping they do not suffer the same fate.But with US and European companies including Alliance Boots, Alltel, First Data Corp, TXU and Tata-Corus all bringing or expected to bring huge junk-rated bond or loan deals in coming weeks and months, investor sentiment and appetite is likely to be well tested.Nowhere is this more true than in the US, where a record $215bn (£107bn) worth of loans is expected to be sold into the markets over the second half of the year, according to data from S&P LCD, the market information service.Key to the success of these loan sales and others in Europe is the health of a highly complex and still young market for collateralised loan obligations (CLOs) – complex financial instruments which repackage portfolios of loans.And the big problem facing sponsors of leveraged buy-outs in particular is that in modern credit markets, sentiment in CLOs and thus in underlying loan markets has become far more closely inter-linked with that in a far broader range of other markets – including, importantly, US subprime mortgages.Testament to this is the impact that the recent scare over US subprime mortgage related problems at two Bear Stearns hedge funds is already having on US and even European CLO markets.“Sentiment had already turned quite poor in April, but then there was a quiet period when the pipeline of deals was lighter, some of the secondary market backlog got cleared and wider spreads bought buyers back in,” says Clayton Perry, head of European CLOs at Credit Suisse. “But there has definitely been a further softening in the past couple of weeks.”The inter-connections between debt markets were neatly summed up by Paul Tucker, a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee earlier this year. He likened the system of slicing and dicing risk to a set of Russian dolls.Leveraged loans or mortgages are repackaged and sold as CLOs or mortgage backed bonds. Parts of these are then sold on into other kinds of collateralised debt obligations, parts of which in turn can also be sold to other CDOs or different complex investment vehicles.If one element of this system hits difficulties it can soon have an impact on the demand for and pricing of all the other elements.The market for CLOs has already been suffering this year due to US subprime concerns. Spreads or risk premiums demanded by investors for tranches of CLOs have seen some dramatic increases.This could mean that some of the CLOs that are due to come to market in the coming months could struggle. JPMorgan estimates there are some $18bn worth of US leveraged loan CLOs in the pipeline and about $15bn worth of European deals.However, some of the more sophisticated investors, say the negative sentiment is not all bad news. Miguel Ramos Fuentenebro, managing partner at Washington Square, a London-based hedge fund, says the spread widening has already brought some buying opportunities.Others disagree. Analysts at Deutsche Bank say the economics of CLOs are being squeezed.The wider spreads on rated parts of CLOs means lower returns for the riskiest “equity” tranches. If managers of CLOs cannot sell the equity tranches, they cannot sell the overall deal.Ganesh Rajendra, head of securitisation research at Deutsche Bank, says: “Any further pricing contagion will of course have prolonged consequences for CLO deal flow viability going forward.” There has been some push back among CLOs and other buyers of loans against some of the more aggressively structured deals recently. “That’s a pretty healthy sign,” says one London banker. “It means the bubble can deflate itself and the market can reprice without there being massive credit losses.”But for this to happen, there has to be a few failed syndications of loans. This will be painful for the underwriting banks.Alliance Boots’ £9bn of covenant lite loans will provide the biggest test.
408;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-07-01T21:44:09Z;Appealing to the pensions referee;;"The highly leveraged bids for two of Britain’s biggest high street names – J Sainsbury and Alliance Boots – has thrust the Pensions Regulator into the spotlight and left some asking whether it needs more power to safeguard the pension schemes of companies targeted by private equity.Last week, Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Alliance Boots, called for the regulator to be empowered to force agreements between scheme trustees of target companies and their potential acquirers to ensure that deals are completed in a timely fashion.“I do not normally call for more regulation but there must be a case for the regulator to have the statutory power to force a timely agreement,” Sir Nigel wrote in a letter to the Financial Times.The letter added fuel to a growing debate over whether the regulator’s powers are adequate.In particular, experts have noted that, until two weeks ago, the regulator had not used the most powerful tools at his disposal: the ability to order companies to make hefty payments into their schemes through issuance of Financial Support Directions (FSDs) or Contributions Notices. Recently, it issued the first of these – an FSD to Sea Containers for the sum of £91m.“People are asking whether he is a toothless tiger,” says one lawyer involved in cases before the regulator.David Norgrove, chairman of the Pensions Regulator, says much regulatory action takes place “below the water line” – where the threat of action is as effective as action itself.“Regulation isn’t a blood sport,” Mr Norgrove says, in a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times. “We are pleased if things are put right without legal action. We don’t exercise powers unless we need to.”Nevertheless, there has been widespread uncertainty about the regulator’s willingness to use the powers that it has.In particular, there has been confusion about the threshold that must be met by highly leveraged buyers seeking control of a company with a defined benefit pension scheme.The regulator has set scheme funding standards for most companies.These aim to eliminate the deficit shown on their balance sheet over a 10-year period. Conventional wisdom has been that the regulator will not seek a higher standard when issuing “clearance” for a corporate transaction. Clearance gives buyers of a company the reassurance that they will not be held to pension liabilities if the company later becomes insolvent. It is not compulsory but, for trustees, it is the one opportunity to demand upfront payment into a scheme, particularly when the new owner will be highly indebted and less able to withstand a downturn.This issue gained prominence during the negotiations between trustees to the Sainsbury and Alliance Boots pension schemes and the private equity consortia trying to buy the companies.After weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations, the consortium bidding for Sainsbury was prepared to offer no more than a cash injection of £300m to £500m, a sum roughly equalling the company’s pension deficit as shown in its latest published accounts.When it emerged that the trustees believed the sum required was as much as £3bn, the City was stunned.Some reckoned it was so ludicrous that the story must have been circulated by the bidding consortium as a ploy to get the share price down.Trustees to the Alliance Boots scheme sought £1bn to fill a deficit that, on paper, barely existed.In both cases, the regulator played a behind-the-scenes role that, according to the trustees of both schemes, backed them.But the detailed workings of the regulator have never become public.In June, MPs questioned Mr Norgrove in a closed-door session.“What is needed is greater clarity,” said John Ralfe, a specialist pensions adviser.Ros Altmann, a pensions specialist, says the regulator should be allowed a degree of confidentiality but believes communication could be improved.“The regulator should have a more pro-active approach to signposting his intentions,” she says. “Trustees need more clarity.”The regulator was created in the Pensions Act of 2004, a complex and arguably hastily enacted piece of legislation.The backdrop was fears that thousands of workers might otherwise lose their retirement funds if their employer became insolvent and left behind an underfunded scheme.With even greater haste, the office opened for business in April 2005.The regulator’s aims are twofold.First, it must ensure that pension promises are met in full and on time. Second, it must limit claims on the Pension Protection Fund, the insurance scheme that covers former workers at companies that have collapsed.Mr Norgrove says he believes the powers of his office are adequate and additional ones – such as those suggested by Sir Nigel – are unnecessary and unworkable.Mr Norgrove sympathises with Sir Nigel who, he says, endured negotiations “that took a lot of time and emotion and angst”.“We would be very, very, wary about [those powers] because we would be in the position of becoming an arbiter of a large part of corporate transactions,” he says.The UK government would be, in effect, be involved with every corporate deal – a role he believes the public does not want it to assume.He adds that, with more than 120,000 defined benefit schemes in the UK, the resources required to undertake such a task would be overwhelming.Mr Norgrove says the clarity that some are seeking is specifically banned by the Act. The regulator relies on confidential information that might not be forthcoming otherwise, he adds. In any case, the City should not have been confused.“Our stance has been that the covenant is relevant to the trustees,” he says. “You could reduce it to a simple equation; scheme assets plus covenant equal [the cost of] full buy-out [with an insurer].”But concerns remain. Pension lawyers note that bidders need not seek clearance, depriving trustees of the chance to demand an upfront payment.“It is fair to say that unscrupulous lawyers can game the system,” one lawyer noted.By the time the new owners are asked for increased contributions, the company may be on its way to insolvency with an under- funded plan.In bankruptcy, scheme members are unsecured creditors and so are last in line for reimbursement.Paul Thornton, a director in charge of pension advisory services at Gazelle Corporate Finance, says much of the regulator’s power resides in his ability to make threats.“What we have is a regulator who is engaged in psychological warfare – just cajoling and persuading,” he says.But the balance “is about right”, he believes. “If one of [the regulator’s] orders did not stick [in a court judgment], he’d be in a good position to come back to Parliament to ask for more powers.”"
409;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-29T21:23:01Z;Banks shrug off Boots’ debt issue;;"Banks launched Europe’s biggest leveraged buy-out debt issue on Friday, shrugging off anxiety in credit markets, to raise £9.02bn for the acquisition of the Alliance Boots pharmacies chain by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Stefano Pessina, Boots deputy chairman.The senior debt will be covenant-light, dispensing with most of the operating performance conditions banks traditionally attach to corporate debt. The only covenant will cover the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.So-called cov-lite loans sparked concerns from rating agencies that added to nervousness in debt markets. A meeting is scheduled for Thursday between banks to organise the selling off of the debt.The banks, including Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, UniCredit (HVB) and Barclays Capital, are also providing bridge equity, committing themselves to buying any equity that KKR and Mr Pessina are unable to place.One banker working on the £11bn buy-out of Boots said Friday night the order book had closed two weeks ago on the £1bn of equity due to be sold by KKR and Mr Pessina. “It is fine. Everyone is very happy,” said the banker.Nerves have been frayed in credit markets after several debt offerings were cancelled or postponed this week amid questions about whether investors are prepared to stomach a wall of cheap loans due to flood the market.In another sign that banks are still prepared to test investors’ appetite for cov-lite loans, Blackstone and Lion Capital, the private equity groups, on Friday announced plans to issue a €192m (£129m) loan without the standard maintenance covenants.The Boots senior debt has been split into five tranches: a £5.05bn eight-year loan; a £1bn seven-year property bridge loan; a £400m seven-year receivables bridge loan; an £820m seven-year revolving credit facility; and a £1bn nine-year second-lien facility. The banks are also issuing £750m of subordinated debt, which carries a 10-year maturity and pays a margin of 600 basis points over Libor.Citigroup is a bookrunner on the subordinated debt, while Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Royal Bank of Scotland and Morgan Stanley are lead arrangers."
410;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Private equity fears avalanche of litigation;;Private equity groups believe litigation against them will increase as they become more high profile, according to a study published on Tuesday.They fear an avalanche of lawsuits from regulators in particular, even though this type of lawsuit has been almost non-existent so far. Forty-seven per cent of private equity groups expect legal action against their industry to increase in the next two years, while only 6 per cent think it will fall, according to the study by Marsh, the world’s biggest insurance broker.The findings come as the world’s largest groups are expanding rapidly, snapping up bigger and more high-profile companies, such as the TXU energy utility in the US and the Alliance Boots pharmacy chain in the UK.The sector has faced accusations from unions that it strips assets, cuts jobs and dodges tax on the colossal wealth it generates. Regulators worry it has increased risks at the companies it buys and in the overall financial system.The Marsh study – based on analysis of 94 claims by its private equity clients and telephone interviews with 150 private equity firms worldwide – found that 83 per cent of respondents felt regulators were the most likely to sue them.Yet, Marsh’s own records showed that litigation by regulators accounted for less than 5 per cent of claims filed against private equity groups over the past three years. In contrast, minority shareholders were the biggest source of lawsuits, accounting for 46 per cent of all claims in the US and 21 per cent in Europe.“Securities litigation has gone down in recent years. But litigation against private equity groups has increased,” said Karen Beldy Torborg, of Marsh’s private equity and M&A practice.Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have identified market abuse as a serious risk for leveraged buy-outs, because many parties had known about the deal beforehand. The US Department of Justice, Britain’s FSA and France’s AMF are examining buy-out groups’ activities on this issue.Yet, Tamasin Little at SJ Berwin, the UK law firm, said: “I’m not aware of any case where private equity has been fingered for market abuse. I would have thought [regulatory litigation] could remain close to zero.”Marsh said litigation claims from its own clients had increased 36 per cent between 2004 and 2006, affecting about 70 per cent of its mid to “mega” buy-out groups. But only 20 per cent of claims paid out, while more than $42m was paid in settlements.
411;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-26T19:16:52Z;Investors are gambling on the promise of biofuels;;If cars running on biofuels performed as erratically as investments in the sector, you could expect a very bumpy ride. On Tuesday, Associated British Foods and BP announced that they and DuPont of the US would build a new biofuel plant in the UK, earning a warmish welcome from investors. Meanwhile, heavily-indebted Biofuels Corporation heralded its disappearance from the public markets, with the publication of plans to restructure and delist.Biofuels’ fate is in part a cautionary tale about the perils of early adoption in a technology – biodiesel in its case – with uncertain potential, in part an old-fashioned saga of commercial mistakes and mishaps. But above all, it is a story about the triumph of investors’ hope over experience. As pointed out here last month, warnings about the impending debt-for-equity swap, which will leave Barclays, the company’s banker, with a large stake and shareholders with next to nothing, proved no deterrent.There is more to be optimistic about in the ABF/BP/DuPont announcement. The venture, split 45-45-10, is expected to open its ethanol factory in 2009, just in time for new UK regulations that will force petrol companies to blend 5 per cent ethanol with their fuel. ABF has a place in all parts of the chain: surplus low-quality wheat supplied by one arm of the group will provide the raw material and a byproduct will go into animal feed produced by another subsidiary. With finance for ABF from the European Investment Bank, this is as near as one gets to a safe bet in an emerging industrial sector – and if it fails, ABF still has staples such as sugar and tea to fall back on.Biofuels’ timing was less happy, although, as an early adopter of a politically popular technology, it did persuade Tony Blair to open its factory last year. That its problems should have come to a head on the eve of the prime minister’s departure is just a spooky coincidence. Spookier still, Biofuels’ shares – whose price is now counted in pennies – were still changing hands in relatively large volume on Tuesday. It seems some brave individuals are still prepared to back the company – if not Mr Blair.Slow to developIt is worth taking time over a strategic review. Rush the review and you’re likely to botch the strategy.Even so, for a company whose core business is getting snapshots or passport photos from camera to customer as fast as possible, Photo-Me International’s lengthy deliberations over what to do next seem glacially slow. JPMorgan Cazenove and Lazard have been examining Photo-Me’s options since November. In the meantime, shareholders have been rewarded with a profit warning (preceded by an ill-timed sale of shares by three directors) and a small part of a promised buy-back.The rickety governance of the group – which includes the presence of a couple of long-standing, non-independent, non-executive directors – has not affected the workings of the board, according to Vernon Sankey, chairman. But it can hardly have helped pep them up.The problem is that, at this stage, it might slow things down to shake up the board, suspend the review and force through the restructuring, as activist investor Principle Capital has proposed. The rebels are right that Photo-Me put the cart before the horse. The board should have been revamped long ago, management renewed and the vending and mini-photo-lab operations separated ready for possible sale. But unharnessing the whole arrangement now would just add another impediment to swift progress.Principle Capital may achieve some of its aims without having to take them to shareholders. The word now from Photo-Me is that Serge Krasnianski, chief executive and a significant shareholder, could well be gone by Christmas. Not the “short timetable” demanded by Principle Capital, but a timetable nonetheless. If Lazard really is gathering expressions of interest for the businesses, then Mr Sankey needs to cajole his board to take a quick decision on whether the price buyers will pay is sufficiently high to justify a disposal, or press ahead with alternative plans. Photo-Me is due to announce results on Monday. As the activists doubtless calculated, that would be a perfect opportunity for Mr Sankey and his fellow directors to show that they know how to seize the day.Rudd’s snooze buttonSir Nigel Rudd’s proposal that the Pensions Regulator should be the arbiter of “what is reasonable” in a funding agreement between pension trustees and a bidder would have accelerated completion of the takeover of Alliance Boots, where he is chairman. But he should be careful what he wishes on other companies, on the regulator (which would have to expand enormously to carry out such duties) and on the trustees.Yes, the plan would alleviate pressure on trustees in a bid situation, where they risk being caught between professional advice to ask for the moon and the need to strike a sensible compromise. But it would also remove responsibility. That would risk negating the regulator’s own campaign to encourage trustees to be more active in protecting scheme members’ savings.Not so much a wake-up call as a back-to-sleep call.
412;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-24T18:12:34Z;Call for more power on pensions;;The Pensions Regulator, the UK regulator of work-based pension schemes, should be given the power to determine how much money should be forcibly placed in a company’s pension scheme at the time of any bid, one of the UK’s most prominent business leaders said.This should be done to avoid onerous demands for cash from trustees that could block transactions, argues Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Alliance Boots, in a letter in today’s Financial Times.“There must be a case for the regulator to have the statutory power to ensure a timely agreement,” Sir Nigel writes. “In order to address this situation, it is my belief that the regulator should be the arbiter of what is reasonable and should have the power to enforce an agreement on both the trustees and the company.”The comments are likely to be carefully watched in the business world, since Alliance Boots is itself the subject of a highly leveraged bid from a consortium led by KKR – and such bids are attracting growing scrutiny from policymakers.Last week, David Norgrove, the pensions regulator, appeared before a closed door hearing of the Parliamentary sub-committee on work and pensions, and MPs asked whether he needed additional powers to deal with schemes at companies facing highly leveraged bids.The issue is important because if a company falls into bankruptcy, members of a pension fund scheme become unsecured creditors. That means they are at the back of a long queue when a heavily indebted company becomes insolvent – and it is not clear that the regulator can force the new owners to make payments to a scheme, pension lawyers have said.However, the regulator is understood to be wary of receiving these new powers, partly because of fears that if a decision was made that led to a shortfall of benefits, then pension fund members could demand compensation.After agreeing an £11.1bn ($22.2bn) buy-out for Alliance Boots, the bidding consortium entered into negotiations with its pension trustee who sought £1bn to cover a shortfall that the buyers thought was minimal. In that case, the trustee was concerned because of the £8.2bn in additional debt the new owners had taken on.Sir Nigel said that although a successful outcome was agreed for Alliance Boots, the system contained many pitfalls. Trustees are being increasingly advised by those urging the most conservative assumptions and funding methods that also incur the highest cost, Sir Nigel said.“It would be a brave or foolhardy chairman of trustees who would go against this advice,” Sir Nigel wrote.The regulator should have the power to impose a required contribution that is less conservative than that sought by trustees, he wrote.
413;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-21T19:48:15Z;FTSE down as bond yields rise;;BG Group was one of just a dozen or so blue chip stocks that managed to end in positive territory on Thursday.Shares in the oil and gas company added 0.7 per cent to 805p in the wake a bullish comments by Frank Chapman, chief executive.During a presentation at Deutsche Bank on Wednesday night, Mr Chapman said the market for liquified natural gas was likely to stay tight until 2015 and the company was confident of hitting the upper end of its exploration and production targets. Those comments prompted Deutsche to reiterate its “buy” rating and 890p target price.All told, it was good day for oil stocks. With the price of crude rising $1 a barrel amid concerns about strikes in Nigeria, Royal Dutch Shell improved 0.5 per cent to £20.47.Centrica, the UK’s biggest domestic gas supplier, was also in demand, rising 0.7 per cent to 379½p amid talk Monday’s half-year trading update could impress.Last week, Citigroup upgraded its earnings forecasts for 2007 and 2008 by 16 and 7 per cent, respectively, citing better customer retention by Centrica.Traders said the stock had also been supported by vague bid speculation with Gazprom once again the name in the frame.In the wider market, the FTSE 100 closed 53.3 points, or 0.8 per cent, lower at 6,596, unsettled by another rise in bond yields, concerns about rising domestic interest rates and renewed worries about the US subprime mortgage market after several Wall Street banks unwound positions in two Bear Stearns hedge funds.So far this week, the blue chip index has lost 136.4 points, or 2 per cent.Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 closed 180.4 points, or 1.5 per cent, lower at 11,617.1.Retail stocks carried the FTSE 100 lower as investors worried about the prospect of domestic interest rates rising next month.DSG International fell 3.9 per cent to 162.8p while Home Retail Group lost 2.5 per cent to 439p.Property stocks were hard hit for much the same reason. Land Securities fell 3.5 per cent to £17.30 while Segro lost 2.5 per cent to 655p. Hammerson fell 1.4 per cent to £14.95 and would have fallen further were it not for rumours of an £18 a share bid approach.Also suffering was Northern Rock. The mortgage lender slipped 3.3 per cent to 968p, spooked by a rise in three-month Libor rates – a key metric in its funding.Standard Chartered bucked the weak trend, rising one per cent to £16.75 on the back of a JPMorgan upgrade to “overweight”.Among the mid caps, Weir Group, the valves and pumps group, jumped 10.7 per cent to 701½p as investors applauded the $653m acquisition of US-based SPM Flow Control, a deal that increases Weir’s exposure to the booming oil field services industry.Northgate Information Solutions, off just 0.6 per cent at 78¾p, was supported by talk of a 105p-a-share private equity bid.Northgate ended takeover talks with a number of buyout firms last October but traders are sceptical that any will return given that Northgate has just acquired a majority stake in Arinso, a Belgian software provider.However, they said a sale of Northgate’s outsourcing business could not be ruled out.Intertek gained 0.8 per cent to 982p after UBS reiterated its “buy” rating on the grounds the testing and certification group was a good play on climate change.UBS said the growing energy efficiency market would bring revenue opportunities for the company.Balfour Beatty, off 0.4 per cent at 451¼p, avoided the worst of yesterday’s selling after Dresdner Kleinwort advised clients to “buy” ahead of a half-year trading statement.“We believe it is going to be upbeat on virtually all business areas and could well ‘grasp the nettle’ on Metronet, the main issue we perceive to have weighed on the shares until lately,” the broker said.Rumoured takeover target Biffa fell 3 per cent to 285p after Morgan Stanley placed 22.8m shares – or 6.5 per cent of the waste company.British Energy eased 1.7 per cent to 544.5p but could rally this morning. After the market closed, FTSE said it expected the company to replace Alliance Boots, unchanged at £11.35, in the FTSE 100 on Tuesday.

At Carlyle, which manages almost £30bn, Dr Easton is one of several European managing directors leading the buy-out team in London. He sits on the board of AZ Electronic Materials, Firth Rixson, Stahl and Ensus.Philip Yea, chief executive, 3i GroupPhilip Yea took over as chief executive of FTSE 100-listed 3i Group in 2004. As finance director of Guinness in the 1990s, he was a key figure in the merger creating the Diageo drinks group. Since joining 3i, Mr Yea has pushed through change, cutting the private equity group’s UK office network, expanding in new markets and establishing new business lines, including infrastructure and a unit taking minority stakes in listed companies.Dominic Murphy, partner, Kohlberg Kravis RobertsHeading KKR’s European healthcare and consumer products team, Mr Murphy came to public prominence in the UK as the brains behind the US group’s bid for the Alliance Boots. chemists’ chain. The £11.1bn acquisition was Europe’s biggest private equity deal and the first to take a FTSE 100 company private. The Liverpool university graduate began his private equity career at 3i, joining KKR from Cinven in 2005.Damon Buffini, managing partner, PermiraA Cambridge graduate and Harvard MBA, Mr Buffini worked for the LEK Partnership and the Imperial Group before founding Permira in the 1990s. Now one of Europe’s largest buy-out firms, Permira manages about £15bn. Mr Buffini became a target for public criticism after cutting thousands of jobs at Birds Eye and the AA. He is one of the few private equity partners to have defended the industry against attacks from the media, unions and politicians.
415;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Depleted princes leave with honour intact;;The famous five were reduced to the fearless four at Wednesday’s Treasury select committee hearing on private equity.David Blitzer, senior managing director of Blackstone, the US private equity colossus, left his four rivals from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, 3i, Carlyle and Permira to fight the corner of the private equity industry, claiming his company’s planned flotation stopped him showing up.John McFall, the deeply sarcastic Labour chairman of the committee, briefly noted Mr Blitzer’s grovelling letter of apology before launching into a critique of private equity’s failings to present a coherent and clear defence of its raison d’être.“You have been fighting like ferrets in a sack between yourselves. This industry needs to get its act together, doesn’t it?” he inquired of the four buy-out titans before him.Dominic Murphy, the brains behind KKR’s bid for Alliance Boots, turned out to be the most prickly of the four. “I think the industry has to get on the front foot and do more,” he admitted. “KKR is a patient, involved, long-term investor,” he said, adding he planned to keep Boots for at least five years.Asking about the risk of increased leverage and how that was diminished by wider debt syndication to third-party investors, Mr McFall inquired: “A few small people are going to get a slap in the face, but no one is going to get killed, is that right?”Damon Buffini, the Permira managing partner, said very little and when he did speak he kept calm. “The FSA has been pretty clear on what they think of systemic risk and they think it is low,” he answered.Asked why Nicholas Ferguson, head of SVG Capital and Permira’s biggest investor, criticised buy-out chiefs for paying “less tax than a cleaning lady”, Mr Buffini said: “Nick’s comments highlighted a concern and we welcome the review into that by the Treasury.”He added defiantly: “I don’t think we are doing anything wrong. I think myself and my partners have built one of the world’s most successful financial services companies with our own capital.”In spite of the tension, there were some jokes. An-gela Eagle, the vocal Labour critic of the industry, asked about why fees had not fallen as fund size increased: “Two per cent of a small fund is not the same as 2 per cent of a very big fund.”“Your maths is impeccable,” answered Robert Easton of Carlyle. “Our fund is on a lower fee basis. We charge 1.5 per cent. Fees have gone down,” he said.Philip Yea, chief executive of 3i, was described by one committee member as “the friendly face of private equity” as his publicly listed company discloses more information than its private rivals. He argued that fees were “negotiated between consenting adults”, but agreed they could be questioned on larger funds.Sounding like the experienced old-hand, Mr Yea warned that an ill-judged tax change could push investment offshore.The confrontational tone mirrored the aggressive slant on questions thrown at trade union leaders just hours earlier. “This is just old-fashioned class politics,” Siôn Simon, a Labour committee member, suggested to the union leaders.Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, cited his experience at the AA breakdown service acquired by Permira. “It very quickly became clear that we didn’t know who the owner was. We couldn’t find them.”The private equity princes, as they have been dubbed, left with their honour intact, but the influential committee members seemed dissatisfied with their answers.
416;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-20T18:14:59Z;What the Victorians can teach us;;The fallacy of our age is that we are superior to our ancestors because we have cooler personal technology. We mock Great Great Grandpa Ebenezer scowling out from his daguerreotype. His mutton chop whiskers do indeed cause him to resemble a disgruntled orang-utan. But wait. Born in a slum, Ebenezer invented a liniment that claimed to cure bronchitis, scurvy, influenza, ringworm and piles. He made a packet and paid for an orphanage. Perhaps he wasn’t so dumb.Pertinently, the legacies of two other eminent Victorian entrepreneurs face threats. Brummies fret over the future of the chocolate business created by George Cadbury. City gossips have tipped Cadbury for acquisition when it has spun off Schweppes. Once within the gates of its worker-friendly Bournville factory, a barbarian buyer might develop the site unworthily as a bowl-a-rama and leisureplex. Alliance Boots has already agreed to a buy-out backed by private equity. In Nottingham, where Jesse Boot first peddled pills and later disbursed the proceeds, retrenchment and redevelopment are feared too.On Tuesday a Financial Times graphic showed a simian in a top hat and frock coat evolving into a City slicker with a BlackBerry. This overlooked the tendency of history to be circular as well as linear. Victorian businessmen cracked problems that still crop up today, as underlined by Enlightened Entrepreneurs, a recently republished book by Ian Bradley (Lion, £9.99). Never mind Edwardian Supersize Me, a reality TV show in which two Z-listers stuffed themselves with kedgeree. For business people, a better experiment would be Victorian Super Motivate Me.A simple but demanding formula can be extrapolated from the life stories of long-dead business titans recounted in the book. Rise at 5am every day for a cold bath before leading your staff in prayers. Eschew the usury of credit periods, paying every bill on the nail. Foreswear strong drink, rich food, foul language and the licentiousness of the waltz. Your appetite for work will shine out like a beacon to your employees. Reward them with bonuses paid from your own pocket in shiny crowns.The only self-reproach you may feel will concern the ungodly pride occasioned – miserable sinner that you are – by the offer of a baronetcy. Naturally, you will decline. You will live frugally, thus increasing the pecuniary sum available for the relief of suffering among the poor. So forget about hiring Beyoncé to perform at your 40th.It may help that we are rolling round a similar loop in history to the Victorians. Growing trade is fuelling economic growth. Today we call it globalisation and its shock troops are multinationals and MTV. Back then it was called the British Empire. Its agents were heroic Tommies who, armed only with howitzers and Maxim guns, defeated natives brandishing some seriously pointy sticks. British workers are today switching from manufacturing to services, as they once swapped from agriculture to industry. Airlines and the internet are speeding up transport and communication, just as railways and the electric telegraph did in the 1800s.Jesse Boot, the Sir Terry Leahy of his day, discovered he could drive sales with the loss leaders and low prices made possible by his chain’s economies of scale. Independent chemists demanded government action to halt the juggernaut. They enjoyed no greater success than corner shops have had in opposing Tesco.Early adopters of new technology made a killing. George Cadbury imported machinery that extracted the bitter butter from cocoa beans, producing a purer, tastier chocolate. Andrew Carnegie, “The Star-Spangled Scotchman”, introduced durable steel rails to the US. He became the world’s richest man and biggest philanthropist. Those are quite obviously the only two similarities between Carnegie, a shrewd monopolist who overworked his staff, and Bill Gates.As living standards rise, so does disposable income and spending on healthcare, fashion and food. Joseph Holloway cleaned up with laxatives for steamer passengers constipated with ship’s biscuits. He tried bribing Dickens for product placement in Dombey and Son. Titus Salt did nicely, making black mourning fabric as infectious disease decimated the swelling population. Queen Victoria endorsed the look for a helpful 40 years. Huntley and Palmer wooed the consumerist bourgeois by packing their biscuits in fancy tins. These also appealed to African tribesmen, who gave Henry Stanley safe passage in return, as he searched for Dr Livingstone.A quiet word. Be careful about emulating Victorian business models too closely. As with any case studies, some elements may not translate. George Cadbury presented female workers who were about to wed with a carnation, a Bible and the sack. Married women were expected to adopt a role more suited to their weak constitutions and gentle dispositions: producing a dozen children in rapid succession then dying of exhaustion. You could get away with such beliefs in 1895. Not in 2007.British attitudes to charity have shifted too. Most Victorian entrepreneurs were meaner than the philanthropists profiled by Mr Bradley. That was why the poor, via enfranchisement, created the welfare state. But Victorian middle-class families still gave away over a 10th of their income. Carnegie believed a man who died rich died disgraced. He paid for 2,811 libraries. Bunging £2m towards a city academy barely cuts it in comparison. Will today’s financially-based capitalists be remembered a century from now, as Carnegie, Cadbury and Boot are? Not likely.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
417;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-19T12:04:52Z;Charles Pretzlik: Tesco hits the buffers in the UK;;Talk about bending over. Barclays has agreed to drop the eagle from its corporate logo if it succeeds in taking over ABN Amro because some people in The Netherlands are worried about its Nazi connotations. Sure, The Netherlands were occupied and the UK wasn’t, so the eagle may be more upsetting there. But, as the Nazis knew, the eagle – which Barclays has had for more than 200 years – is a symbol dating back at least as far as the Roman, Egyptian and Persian empires. John Varley must know this – he has a first in history. So, will Barclays staff (who will keep the eagle in the UK) object to ABN Amro’s shield, which is being retained, on the grounds that it stirs up unpleasant memories of the Anglo-Dutch wars of the 17th and 18th centuries? And will ABN’s sponsorship of yacht racing remind people of how the Dutch sailed up the Medway to burn the English fleet? Of course not.This is not the only silly story we’re enjoying today. Whitbread is spending £13m to remove the word “Travel” from Premier Travel Inn (plus an additional capital expenditure of £9m for the rebranding).Don’t worry, there is some serious news out there. Tesco seems to have hit the buffers in the UK, where growth rate has slowed dramatically. Like-for-like sales growth in the first quarter has slowed from 5.8 per cent to 4.7 per cent. The shares are off more than 3 per cent.Also, KKR and the Alliance Boots pensions trustees have reached an agreement on the funding of the pension scheme.Cadbury Schweppes has unveiled details of its cost-cutting plans, as we first flagged up in our pages a few weeks ago. Andrew Wood, Bernstein’s award-winning analyst, is impressed with the trading udpate but there is plenty in there to be gloomy about. You can watch Maggie Urry explain it all on our FT.com video.Rumours of the day: Vague – very vague in fact – rumours of a bid for Carluccio’s (where Richard Caring has a holding) and of stake-building by Baugur in Sports Direct.

418;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-19T10:35:47Z;KKR agrees deal with Boots’ pensioners;;The £11.1bn takeover of Alliance Boots appeared to have cleared its most important hurdle on Tuesday after the health and beauty group’s pension trustees agreed a funding package with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.After weeks of tense negotiations, KKR agreed to increase its cash payment to the pension fund to meet a shortfall of £305m claimed by the trustees. The private equity group is to pay £418m in cash over ten years - or a net present value of £305m - to buttress the fund against the threat of the company’s insolvency.KKR has also put up a security package where the fund would have a priority claim over £200m in the event of insolvency and a claim that ranks equal with senior bank lenders over an additional £400m.Trustees took legal advice over the possibility of blocking the takeover if they had failed to reach agreement with KKR. The deal is likely to take some heat out of Wednesday’s encounter between Dominic Murphy, European head of health care and consumer products at KKR, and MPs on the Treasury select committee who are examining the role of private equity.The high-profile efforts by private equity investors to buy out some of Britain’s biggest companies have focused attention on the possible threat to retirement benefits that occurs when highly leveraged buyers become the guarantors of retirement benefits.The wrangle over Alliance Boots’ scheme also raised questions about whether the Pensions Regulator had sufficient legal power to intervene in similar disputes.“All of our members will benefit from the agreement and I am delighted that this period of uncertainty has come to an end with this positive result,” said John Watson, chairman of the trustees.“We are very pleased to have reached an agreement which will ensure that the Boots pension scheme will remain well funded and that the long-term benefits of the scheme members will be safeguarded,” said AB Acquisitions, the vehicle for the acquirers, who alongside KKR also include Stefano Pessina, the company’s deputy chairman.
419;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-18T21:20:49Z;‘Cov-lite’ deals surge despite warnings;;The use of so-called “cov-lite” deals is snowballing in Europe and the US, in spite of warnings from regulators and financiers that these instruments could produce new dangers for investors if the credit cycle turns.In recent weeks London bankers have sold a flurry of financing packages for European companies that feature reduced use of covenants – stipulations, such as minimum levels of interest coverage, to protect lenders.Those raising finance have included investment group Gartmore, fund manager Jupiter, catering group Gate Gourmet and chemicals group Cognis.The private equity owners of Dutch retailer Maxeda and European telecoms group Debitel are expected to raise such deals soon, while KKR, the buy-out firm, may use cov-lite loans to fund its acquisition of pharmacy group Alliance-Boots.In the US, more than a third of all loan issuance this year has been cov-lite, according to Standard and Poor’s Leveraged Commentary Data, an industry newsletter. “Talk is that arrangers [investment banks] are being told not to bother calling [private equity] sponsors for new mandates unless they are prepared to do cov-lite,” says S&P LCD.The trend has horrified traditional financiers, who warn that it will leave investors exposed to losses if the credit cycle turns. Regulators and central bankers fear it indicates that credit markets are in a bubble.Some private equity groups retort that the trend reflects a longer-term shift in the structure of the capital markets. Bankers say there is no sign that these warnings are stemming the trend of cov-lite. Indeed bankers are experimenting with even more complex deals, such as those that do not require borrowers to make any repayment until the end of the loan, or “cov-loose” deals that remove part of the covenant.Traditionally, investors have demanded covenants on loans so they can monitor borrowers, and seize control if targets are breached. With these partly, or completely, removed, it is hard to assess how much value lenders could extract if a company failed.This in turn makes it difficult to monitor the risks attached to instruments created from pools of loans, such as collateralised loan obligations.S&P plans to adopt a more negative approach to rating CLOs.
420;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-13T21:51:01Z;Sir Ronald adds fuel to private equity fire;;It is one thing for the GMB union, complete with symbolic camel, to protest against tax breaks for the private equity industry.For similar – albeit more nuanced – criticism to be voiced from the upper echelons of the industry itself, it is quite another.First, it was Nicholas Ferguson, chairman of SVG Capital and in effect the founder of Permira, who last week said it was wrong that executives paid lower tax rates than cleaners.Now Sir Ronald Cohen, former chairman of Apax Partners, is adding his voice to the debate in terms that will be far from reassuring for his peers.It is reasonable, he says, for executives behind small, entrepreneurial private equity funds to pay as little as 10 per cent tax on their earnings. But the same breaks cannot be justified for the “mega-funds” with billions of pounds to spend.His remarks came in an interview with the Financial Times intended to discuss the successful first fund-raising of a new property fund by Portland Capital, his new asset management group.They are likely to be taken seriously, not least because of Sir Ronald’s close relationship with Gordon Brown.The comments come, ironically, just as Apax itself, from which Sir Ronald departed in 2005, has lifted the target for its latest European fund to up to €11.17bn (£7.5bn). This would top the previous record by rival Permira of €11.1bn. Meanwhile, Apax has abandoned the venture capital business from which it grew.Such funds can generate enormous payments for private equity partners who usually get “carried interest” – typically a 20 per cent share of any profits from selling companies on. It is this carried interest that is eligible for taper relief, which reduces their rate of tax from 40 per cent to 10 per cent.In effect, Sir Ronald admits that such funds, targeting buy-outs of big household names in various industries, are not quite the same as the tiny entrepreneurial businesses which the government had hoped to aid with its tax breaks.It is not yet clear how ministers would differentiate between large and small.“I think the 10 per cent rate is perfectly appropriate for entrepreneurial, new and young funds. It would be a mistake for us to assume that you don’t need low capital gains tax to encourage start-ups,” he says.“I think where you’re dealing with massive funds and they’re not the first of their kind, they follow from a series . . . maybe the 10 per cent rate needs to be raised to something reasonable.”Five years ago, private equity operated below the public radar because funds were much smaller, he says. Now, by contrast, even industrial “national icons” are in reach of the private equity funds.“You cannot expect the same level of attention for your activities if you’re investing in enormous firms employing tens or hundreds of thousands of people as you would buying Sainsbury’s or Boots, he says. “They are icons in this country and viewed as centres of our national existence.”Sir Ronald, a socially minded capitalist and politically attuned individual, appears to have seen which way the wind is blowing.His argument that higher tax rates could be appropriate but only for bigger funds, could be seen as an attempt to soften the forthcoming blow by winning an exemption at least for smaller, more entrepreneurial private equity vehicles.Among these may be a new £75m fund set up by Bridges Ventures, a venture capital firm founded by Sir Ronald to invest in companies in deprived areas of the UK.The line is similar to that adopted by Paul Myners, former chairman of Marks and Spencer, who also believes that tax breaks should be preserved for trad-itional venture capital. Mr Myners has suggested that the flipping of large companies by private equity groups is “the cuckoo in the nest”.Sir Ronald, meanwhile, echoed recent comments by Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI and a former editor of the FT, in urging ministers not to go overboard in how they deal with the increasingly thorny issue of tax.“It is necessary to compare tax and incentives to other countries that are keen to attract the private equity industry to their territories,” he says.“Maybe the incentives are too attractive at the bigger end but if we make them too unattractive we may see the power of the City of London diminished.”Additional reporting Kate Burgess
421;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-11T20:46:09Z;Private equity checks for UK banks;;UK banks will have their exposure to private equity monitored every six months from next year, under new rules announced on Monday to address intensifying fears about the risks of rising debt and leverage levels.The UK Financial Services Authority on Monday issued a stern warning about the risks – particularly the danger of market abuse, conflicts of interest and excessive leverage – which it said stemmed from the rapid growth of private equity’s role in the UK economy.The industry has caused controversy after bidding for some of Britain’s biggest listed companies, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’ agreed purchase earlier this year of Alliance Boots for £11.1bn and a failed CVC-led approach for J Sainsbury.“The amount of credit that lenders are willing to extend on private equity transactions has risen substantially,” said the FSA in a report summarising the responses from an array of private equity players to its discussion paper on the industry issued in November. “This lending may not, in some circumstances, be entirely prudent.”It unveiled plans to extend a one-off report it completed last year on banks’ exposure to leveraged lending, making it a semi-annual exercise from the first quarter of 2008.“This will allow us to better understand developments in the leverage and complexity of financing within leveraged buy-out transactions, how exposures are distributed and the risks that this may present,” said the FSA.The FSA launched a fact-finding mission into the likely behaviour of the different debt-holders, such as hedge funds, in the event of a big private equity default.The regulator also announced plans to investigate the worries about conflicts of interest within private equity firms, such as between the buy-out funds and their own in-house advisory firms, which receive fees on services to the fund.Buy-out chiefs reacted with disappointment to the FSA report, saying they had expected it to be more ambitious.“They need to stress-test the whole financial market to see how it would react,” said one private equity partner.Separately, the European Central Bank warned that shareholder activism on the part of hedge funds and private equity groups could at times hinder the companies they invest in.Putting public pressure on companies to change their strategy “might often be excessively oriented towards the short term”, it said in a report about corporate finance in the eurozone.
422;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-08T20:45:42Z;Baker breathes new life into Alliance Boots;;"Richard Baker is on a walkabout in his Oxford Street store and has been ambushed by one of his staff imploring the chief executive of Alliance Boots to take part in the Great British Lung Test.This involves blowing, hard, into a tube to assess the “age” of your lungs. Boots is running the test to help with some British Lung Foundation research – and to make some money by encouraging smokers to sign-up for its quitting scheme.Mr Baker is not keen, even though he has never been a smoker. “It will be all over the newspaper and this is not about Richard, this is about the company.” He looks a bit put out. But his staff press him. “Are you going to write about this?,” he demands, with a sigh of resignation, “If I come out with lungs of a 65-year-old, don’t print it, OK?”He takes a huge gulping breath and blows extremely forcefully into the tube, ending his effort with a splutter.Mr Baker – who is 44 – has the lungs of a 36-year-old. It cheers him up but he is still a little put out that he didn’t have the best puff of the two of us. “Not bad; if I had beaten you, I would have been even happier.”He readily admits he is ridiculously competitive: “Funny that, why wouldn’t I be? I spend my life playing sport – hockey on Saturday and tennis every Sunday morning”.In spite of this strong desire to win, he says he does not like being the centre of attention.“I never wanted to be a celebrity chief executive,” he says, back in the safety of his small office above the store. “The celebritisation of business people, I think it is a dangerous thing, this whole hero or zero thing. My strong conviction is that successful businesses are run by strong teams of people where no one person has an excessive influence over the business. If you over-personalise the leader in my mind you are a hostage to fortune.”But as chief executive of the first FTSE 100 company to fall into private equity hands, as well as being a household name, Mr Baker is being constantly talked about.The City and the retail industry want to know whether Mr Baker will throw his lot in with KKR and Stefano Pessina, the deputy chairman and the mastermind behind the deal. The private equity group has said it wants to keep the current management team. Mr Baker claims he has yet to talk to them about his role.Asked how he feels about the concept of working for private equity owners, Mr Baker says he has “an open mind”, adding that his former Asda colleague boss, Tony DeNunzio, who now runs a business for KKR, gives “fantastic reports” about his new bosses.“I don’t think [private equity] is the scary ogre that is has been portrayed as. If I honestly thought that I couldn’t have recommended the deal, but I think the company can grow and this platform has been built.”The question is whether, having run the shop by himself for more than three years, Mr Baker will really want to stay when KKR and Mr Pessina are calling the shots. Mr Baker has already been a chief operating officer at Asda after it was bought by Wal-Mart, and some retail industry watchers have pointed out that the chief executive of Alliance Boots might not want to go back to that role at this stage of his career.“The observation is reasonable,” says Mr Baker. “I have to wait and see, I haven’t spoken to them or seen the details. Until I know what is going to be proposed, I am not going to jump to conclusions. I have a bunch of questions.”In the meantime he is also under pressure amid an escalating battle over the future of the pension fund, which has put KKR at loggerheads with John Watson, the chairman of the Alliance Unichem pension scheme.This is uncomfortable territory for Mr Baker. On one hand, he is “proud that 77 per cent of all pharmacy graduates applied to work at Boots. I said I would put the chemist back into Boots, so that is a highlight for me.”On the other hand, these are the same pharmacists who sent their company representative to the extraordinary meeting last month to tell Mr Baker that they were worried about the impact the KKR deal would have on their retirement income.Mr Baker’s expression darkens when he is pressed on the ongoing wrangle between KKR and the pension trustees. “I would like to see this resolved as quickly as possible for the employees,” he says – twice. He then points out that under his watch the Boots pension fund is one of the few FTSE 100 funds to be in surplus.One thing that he feels strongly about is that he has done a good job for shareholders, particularly since last August’s £7bn merger of Alliance Unichem and Boots.“Everyone said it would be a disaster, but we have just produced earnings [growth] of 11.5 per cent and the FTSE is only about 5 per cent and that is in a year of mergers. Everyone says mergers don’t create value. Well, 18 months ago, the share price was 600p.” says Mr Baker. KKR is paying £11.39 a share for Alliance Boots.It is a pleasing result for Mr Baker, who underwent bruising treatment from the City in the first couple of years at the helm of Boots after a string of bad news stories. His finance director Howard Dodd abruptly resigned and the company made three profit downgrades in quick succession.“I took an unneccessary slating for a 4 per cent miss on the profits – £20m on £500m -– that in the scheme of things was buttons,” says Mr Baker. “I was 40 years old [when getting the job], you are going to make some cock-ups and make mistakes and you do it in the blaze of publicity.”Whatever happens in the weeks ahead, Mr Baker is clear on one thing: his final set of strong annual figures, released in May, were a “vindication of all the hard work”.He is also set for a financial reward for his efforts, netting £6.5m from his share options when the deal is signed off.“The whole last three years has been [about] putting healthcare into the heart of the business,” he says, as he surveys the store. “This is not a self-service supermarket, this is a specialist retailer.”"
423;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-08T20:45:42Z;World of specialists at John Bell & Croyden;;One of the more esoteric items on sale at John Bell & Croyden, a pharmacy on Wigmore Street in central London, is a life-size skeleton complete with manipulable joints and a faintly disturbing retractable skull.The skeleton’s limp frame faces towards a display of medical equipment, from forceps to stethoscopes, very handy for the physicians of nearby Harley Street.Its range of more than 25,000 healthcare products and team of in-house medical consultants prompted Richard Baker, chief executive of Alliance Boots, to declare it the “best chemist” in the business.Although run separately, the store is owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, Alliance Boots’ arch rival, making his comments all the more surprising. The Lloyds chain is owned by the Stuttgart-based Celesio.The shop last year turned over £11.5m, a testament to its monied, cosmopolitan clientele and a selection of high-margin products – a massage chair to alleviate back pain retails for £2500.The Queen is also a customer and the royal warrant, signed by the Lord Chamberlain, hangs proudly on the wall adjacent to the shop’s traditional wooden pharmacy counter.Jamie Russell, marketing manager, says local physicians and GPs refer their patients to the shop, either for a prescription, or to visit one of its clinics and consultants.“We get a lot of referrals from Harley Street, dentists and other healthcare professionals,” he says.Its sales are driven by a unique ability to cross-sell medical treatments and pharmaceutical products, making it a one-stop healthcare provider and the envy of competitors.Sufferers of alopecia who come to purchase a remedy can pay a visit to the shop’s hair clinic, while patients treated by the shop’s chiropodist can follow up their appointment by purchasing some insoles or foot balm.Mr Russell says the internal referral system has created a strong relationship between its pharmacists and clinicians and was beneficial for customers.Alliance Boots’ flagship London store is located close by, on Oxford Street, but its modern, glitzy look is a world away from the traditional apothecary feel of John Bell & CroydenThe ground floor is dominated by the beauty and cosmetics products of leading luxury brands, which has pushed its pharmacy up to the first floor. Although this pharmacy also boasts an optician and chlamydia testing service and advertisements for weight-loss, hair retention and smoking cessation programmes, what it lacks is a raft of specialist medical services.Boots says it has 15,000 health experts, including pharmacists, consultants and advisors on hand in its 1300 stores and it has plans to trial in-house doctors’ surgeries.Until then, there’s always John Bell & Croyden.
424;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-08T20:29:31Z;Alliance Boots chief praises rival outlet;;The chief executive of Alliance Boots said on Friday that he has identified the “best chemist” in town. Unfortunately it is not one of his.In an interview with the Financial Times, Richard Baker described John Bell & Croyden, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, as “absolutely fantastic” and signalled that the Queen’s pharmacist was his template for developing the health and beauty chain.John Bell & Croyden belongs to Lloyds Pharmacy, owned by Celesio. The German pharmaceuticals group had considered making an offer for Alliance Boots when KKR announced its intention to take the group private. That deal is set to go through this summer.Although owned by Lloyds, the pharmacy on Wigmore Street in London is run as an autonomous business. Mr Baker’s goal is to transform Boots into a comprehensive healthcare provider.“If you go to John Bell & Croyden – I think that is the best chemist – it is absolutely fantastic. They have an entire wall of consultation rooms where local health professionals come into the store. They pay rent,” Mr Baker said.“So if someone comes in and says I have terrible back pain, the pharmacist will give them painkillers but then say what you really need is to see a physiotherapist and I can book you an appointment.”Alan Souter, director and general manager of John Bell & Croyden, said the comments were “extremely flattering” and added: “It’s gratifying that someone like Richard holds us in such high esteem.”Mr Baker has made it clear that he wants to rebrand Boots as a healthcare destination rather than a beauty and cosmetics shop.He said he would like some of the bigger Boots stores to have consulting rooms and healthcare services on site.The company offers chlamydia testing in 200 London stores and plans to put doctors’ surgeries in some.Boots is also closing down its 100 opticians and relocating them into its larger shops.In 2005 Boots pulled out of its lossmaking laser eye correction, dentistry, chiropody and laser hair removal businesses. In 2003 it closed centres that offered alternative therapies.The merger with Alliance Unichem, which added 900 pharmacies, had strengthened Boots’ healthcare credentials, he said.
425;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
426;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-04T19:51:35Z;UK pensions and LBOs;;This is turning into a battle royal. Boots’ pension scheme trustees and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which is buying Alliance Boots, have locked horns over the private equity firm’s funding of the scheme. Are the trustees being unreasonable?Boots’ pension fund has an IAS19 surplus of £20m. But the trustees argue that, using the same methodology with updated longevity assumptions, the deficit is £305m. Furthermore, they argue that for the scheme to be truly safe, KKR needs to pay in £1bn. This should come partly in the form of some cash but also by moving a portion of the liabilities up the hierarchy of creditors.The Boots’ trustees’ demands may be more aggressive than those in other recent deals but that does not necessarily make them excessive. The pension regulator has said that, in the event of leveraged buy-outs, trustees should consider seeking “mitigation” materially greater than the IAS19 deficit. But it has left it up to trustees and employers to bash out what this actually means.In no recently completed deal, however, has the upfront cash injection been the sticking point. Instead, trustees have agreed a package of measures to improve the safety of their schemes’ funding position. Ferrovial, for example, paid no cash into BAA’s pension scheme, which had a £124m IAS19 deficit. Instead, some of the scheme’s liabilities were moved up the rank of creditors and contributions – measured as a proportion of pensionable salaries – were increased from 17 per cent to 25 per cent. Tata Steel did pay off Corus’ IAS19 deficit but the trustees were also prepared to accept the promise of higher contributions.Time will tell whether the trustees of Corus’ and BAA’s schemes were too complacent. The regulator, though, apparently believes recent deals have protected pension scheme members. But if the Boots’ trustees achieve their demands, it will set a precedent for future deals that other pension schemes will ignore at their peril.
427;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-04T16:32:43Z;Dear Henry, let some light in on the closed world of private equity;;"Dear Henry Kravis,Forgive me for writing to you out of the blue like this, but I thought it was high time we had a talk. Some people have been saying harsh things about you and your private equity colleagues. Please accept these observations from a critical friend.You said, at a conference in Canada last week, that private equity had entered a “golden era”. This statement surely betrays a rare lapse in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’s famed skills at valuation. For private equity, this era is not merely golden: it is diamond-encrusted.You went on to declare that prospects for your industry were good. There might be a downturn, you conceded, but a bubble? “I don’t know what a bubble means,” you said.Well, how about this for a definition of a bubble: KKR’s $16bn of “covenant-lite” loans being drawn to help fund a $29bn buy-out of First Data, the credit card processing business?This is twice the size of the previous biggest “cov-lite” loan. The First Data deal also benefits from more than $7bn of underwritten bridge equity and $8bn of bridge loans. Does that not look a bit like a bubble to you?Meanwhile, in the UK, your colleagues continue to conduct a pretty fierce negotiation over the future health of the Boots pension scheme, which is now your responsibility following KKR’s £11bn takeover of Alliance Boots a few weeks ago.Trustees of the pension scheme have been looking for a cash injection to make good a £305m deficit – a not unreasonable request, given the more than £8bn of debt Alliance Boots is now taking on. But the trustees (not to mention the unions and former employees) have so far been underwhelmed by KKR’s rather grudging approach.I am sorry to go on. It is just that the muscular activity of private equity businesses
is attracting a lot of attention at the moment, and I thought that you might be well placed
to clear up some of the uncertainty that surrounds your dealings.As you admitted in Halifax, Nova Scotia, last week: “We’ve done a lousy job as an industry of getting our message out. All of us . . . need to get our message out to the press, get our message out to government officials, to our investors and to anyone that will listen as to what we do.”So, er, what is it that you do? Is it just a question of spotting badly run, undervalued (but asset-rich) companies, whose shareholders you buy off with a large lump of cheaply raised finance? There must be more to it than that.What is it about being private that is so attractive and helpful? Is it the longer time horizons you have, being able to take a three-to-five-year view of a business at a time when stock market investors berate corporate management after anything more than one bad quarter in a row?Or is it simply that you like the idea of being able to earn fantastic sums of money away from the glare of regulators, media and peers? Perhaps it is a bit of both.Are you actually interested in owning any of these businesses you buy, or are you just a portfolio investor, a financial engineer? As Tim Parker, chief executive of the AA, the private equity-owned vehicle recovery group, told the London Evening Standard last week: “At the end of private equity ownership, there is always a transaction – that’s the nature of the industry.” If flotation is the most common end goal, does that mean that being private is ultimately an inferior option?Perhaps you find these questions impertinent. But, you see, I just want to help you “get your message out”.The attention you are receiving is not illegitimate. Private equity is on every manager’s agenda. It is even on the G8’s agenda this week in Germany – a country where, as you know, private equity (and hedge funds) have been described as “locusts”. Another G8 delegate, Nicolas Sarkozy, the newly elected French president, also referred disparagingly to financial “predators” in his election campaign. So the stakes could not be higher.In advance of the G8 summit, the host, Angela Merkel, told the German Bundestag: “We want to give globalisation a human face.” But when you joked in Canada last week about preferring being called a barbarian to a locust, there was a whiff of hubris in the air, a defiance that may not endear you to the German chancellor and her colleagues.Look, I get it. It is called “private equity”. The clue is in the name. The strategy that your colleagues have adopted until now – “Never explain, never apologise” – does have its attractions. But when private businesses grow as big and powerful as you have, it becomes a public matter.Let a bit of light in on the magic. Join the debate. Make your case. The golden era will not go on for ever. Better to open up now if you want to avoid a future that is too, well, taxing.Yours, etc."
428;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-04T12:55:07Z;Pensions and buyouts;;This is turning into a battle royal. Boots’ pension scheme trustees and KKR, which is buying Alliance Boots, have locked horns over the private equity firm’s funding of the scheme. Are the trustees being unreasonable?Boots’ pension fund has an IAS19 surplus of £20m. But the trustees argue that, using the same methodology but updating longevity assumptions, it actually has a £305m deficit. Furthermore, they argue that for the scheme to be truly safe, £1bn is required from KKR. This should come partly in the form of cash payments, but more importantly by moving a portion of the liabilities up the hierarchy of creditors.The Boots’ trustees’ demands may be more aggressive than those involved in other recent deals, but that does not necessarily make them excessive. The UK pension regulator has said that, in the event of highly leveraged buyouts, trustees should consider seeking “mitigation” materially greater than the IAS19 deficit. But it has left it up to trustees and employers to bash out what this actually means.In no recently completed deal, however, has the upfront cash injection been the sticking point. Instead, trustees have agreed a package of measures to improve the safety of their schemes’ funding position. Ferrovial, for example, paid no cash into BAA’s pension scheme, which had a £124m IAS19 deficit. Instead, some of the scheme’s liabilities were moved up the rank of creditors, and contributions – measured as a proportion of pensionable salaries – were increased from 17 to 25 per cent. Tata Steel did pay off Corus’ IAS19 deficit, but the trustees were prepared to accept the promise of higher contributions.Time will tell whether the trustees of Corus’ and BAA’s pension schemes were too complacent. The regulator, though, apparently believes recent deals have protected pension scheme members. But if the Boots’ trustees achieve their demands, it will set a precedent for future deals that other pension schemes will ignore at their peril.
429;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-01T21:13:58Z;Fears over power at Pensions Regulator;;David Norgrove, chairman of the Pensions Regulator, has been asked to appear before a Parliamentary subcommittee amid concerns that he lacks the formal power to force heavily indebted employers to step up payments to their pension schemes.The move comes as two high-profile efforts by private equity investors to buy out two of Britain’s biggest high street chains, Sainsburys and Alliance Boots, have focused attention on the possible threat to retirement benefits that occurs when highly leveraged buyers become the guarantors of retirement benefits.Lawyers and advisers have expressed concern that the regulator is using the force of his office to obtain up-front pension contributions when companies change hands that may not be enforce-able in law.“The regulator does punch above his weight,” said Tim Cox, partner at Linklaters, the City law firm.However, there is no formal need for investors to obtain the approval of the regulator for their deal, a practice known as seeking “clearance” which insures the investors will not personally be held liable for pension shortfalls if the company later becomes insolvent.Some experts have questioned whether the regulator should get more power to require up-front payments. Indeed, the consortium buying Alliance Boots received approval from shareholders while it remained locked in talks with scheme trustees.Greg Mulholland, a Liberal Democrat member of the committee, said the question of whether the regulator had sufficient legal powers to ensure that pensions schemes receive up-front funding in the event of a takeover would be “high on our agenda”.However, the Department for Work and Pensions said it was confident that the regulator’s powers, contained in the 2004 pensions act, were sufficient.
430;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-06-01T19:19:29Z;Pensions Regulator needs more than its bark;;In a world where pension provision is becoming increasingly uncertain, it is nice to know that there is a hard-talking Pensions Regulator to ensure that workers can sleep easy about their retirement benefits.Assuming, that is, the regulator has the bite to back up its bark.MPs are not so sure that it has. They have asked for an audience with the regulator amid concern that the public is placing too much faith in its powers. Their worries are not unfounded.While the regulator likes to talk tough, there is no hard evidence that it could hold its own in a fight with a private equity firm that was seeking to buy a company and load it up with debt, thereby weakening the covenant supporting its pension scheme.Yet the regulator has created the impression that it should not be messed with. It recently urged pension trustees to take a tough line if a buy-out firm tried to acquire the company that sponsors their pension scheme. It was surely no coincidence that the chairman of the trustees at Alliance Boots pointedly voiced concern about the impact of KKR’s leveraged buy-out of the chemist at this week’s shareholder meeting.The reality is that the regulator’s real power is vague. No one has ever challenged it by taking it to court. There are two situations where this could arise. A private equity bidder could clash with the regulator about proposed remedies to strengthen the pension scheme of the company it is acquiring. Or a company could challenge the regulator on any plan to top up a deficit over the next ten years, an obligation on all UK schemes in deficit. The scope for disagreement is huge, including the methods used to calculate the pension’s liabilities.Moreover, the regulator’s workings are opaque. They are not bound by freedom of information legislation.The risk is that one day a private equity bidder mounts a legal challenge to the regulator and wins. That is not so far fetched. The Pensions Act was not specifically designed for protecting pension schemes in the event that a change of control weakens the sponsoring company.It would be a serious setback for the regulator’s credibility if it was found to be all mouth and no trousers. If it feels it needs stronger statutory backing, now is the time to let MPs know.Hedge fund humourA sense of humour is as rare in a hedge fund as a pair of hush puppies. Centaurus Capital, the London-based hedge fund, has just bought both. It has hired Kenneth Clarke, the jovial Conservative MP, as an adviser. But Mr Clarke’s appointment, along with that of former Spanish premier José María Aznar, also demonstrates that investment is about a lot more than number crunching nowadays.Centaurus typically makes investment decisions using a “bottom up” approach. This involves detailed analysis of company results statements and industrial trends.But focusing on the particular only gets you so far in a world where non-financial issues are increasingly relevant to investment decisions. Politics regularly collides with business, whether through resource nationalism or protectionism in cross-border takeovers. A keen understanding of the likely policy response to climate change may be just as lucrative for a hedge fund as the definitive analysis of Barclays’ cost of capital, although the immediate application may be less specific.Centaurus’s hires will inevitably have other advisory posts on companies in which it may be an investor. But the potential conflicts of interest should be manageable. While the appointments look decorative, there is logic to suggest that they will, in the long-run, improve investment returns for investors. And Mr Clarke will prove to Centaurus’s investment professionals that there is more to footwear than Gucci loafers.Conflicts at IsoftNormally it is a good thing when a struggling company receives two rival takeover approaches. But for Isoft, the technology group, nothing could be further from the truth.To re-cap, Isoft recently recommended a takeover by Australia’s IBA Health. But this week CSC, Isoft’s partner in a key contract with the NHS, declined to back the deal. CSC has the power to block any change of control at Isoft – a pretty common clause in big government contracts.Oddly, CSC had previously written to Isoft to say that it approved of the IBA deal. The precise details as to why it has changed its mind are unclear. However, it now emerges that CSC has all along been interested in mounting its own bid for Isoft. That gives it an incentive to thwart IBA’s bid.Isoft is talking about dragging CSC to the courts to force its partner to show that it has reasonable grounds for withholding consent. But so long as CSC can prove that it does, then it is perfectly understandable that it is pressing home its advantage in the auction for Isoft. In any case, its support for the IBA bid was never cast-iron.The snag is that CSC has been seen to have flip-flopped in its dealings with Isoft. However legitimate, its hardball tactics are not without reputational risk. For Isoft’s shareholders, that offers some hope it may back down.
431;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-31T23:09:57Z;Pensions ‘showdown’ looms in Boots buy-out;;The Kohlberg Kravis Roberts-led takeover of Alliance Boots looks poised to become a key test of the Pensions Regulator’s powers to protect company schemes after the buy-out was backed by shareholders but without any agreement on filling the fund’s deficit.At a thinly-attended shareholder meeting on Thursday, John Watson, chairman of the board of trustees of the Alliance Boots pension scheme, said it and the consortium had not yet reached agreement on additional funding.Mr Watson said the trustees “have made it clear that the borrowings in excess of £8bn being taken on to finance this acquisition have serious implications for the scheme”.He said: “We have still not reached a satisfactory agreement, which inevitably gives trustees serious worries about the future.”One pensions lawyer said the dispute was “shaping up to be the showdown at the OK Corral”.Pensions lawyers believe that KKR, which has not yet received “clearance” for its transaction from the pensions watchdog, will challenge the latter’s ability to insist trustees negotiate up-front payments from employers to fund deficits.The rules only apply to transactions that are structured to avoid paying pension liabilities.The regulator recently issued guidance urging trustees to seek clearance – a procedure that absolves them of personal liability in the event the employer later becomes insolvent – when corporate transactions pile on heavy new debts.However, lawyers said the regulator’s ability to do so, while enshrined in the general spirit of the Pensions Act of 2004, was not specifically written into it.The KKR consortium said the group was not seeking a showdown with the trustees.“We are working hard to achieve a constructive result,” it said.Sir Nigel Rudd, Alliance Boots chairman, told shareholders: “I will be pressing very hard for a resolution because we don’t want people to be worried about their pensions.”However, at the shareholders’ meeting, Kevin Taylor, a retired pharmacist who had worked for Boots for 35 years, said he “felt unease” over the buy-out.“I would like to hear that my future . . . is secure,” he said.
432;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-30T23:34:11Z;KKR in cov-lite loan milestone;;The rise of so-called “cov-lite” loans has reached another milestone after it emerged that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US private equity firm, would raise a record $16bn of such loans to fund its buy-out of First Data.The rapid emergence of covenant-light loans, which dispense with the conditions linked to operating performance that banks usually att­ach to corporate debt, has spar­ked concern about weakening lending standards and the solidity of the credit market. First Data, the payments and credit card processing company, accepted a $26.1bn takeover offer from KKR in April. The deal will be partly funded by $7.17bn of equity from KKR and the seven investment banks advising it on the transaction.But the conditions att­ached to the debt KKR is raising are likely to raise most eyebrows. Banks led by Credit Suisse have agreed to provide a $14bn seven-year loan and a $2bn six-year revolving credit facility, First Data said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission this week.This $16bn of secured senior debt has no covenants relating to operating performance, such as cash flow, which usually give banks the right to demand repayment or take control of the company if the conditions are not respected. The First Data loan is almost equal to the $16.6bn total of cov-lites issued in all of April.Cov-lite loans have spread rapidly since first emerging in US private equity deals last year. They spread to Europe this year and are picking up speed. Bankers funding KKR’s £11.1bn bid for Alliance Boots are seeking a cov-lite loan for the deal.The practice shows how strong private equity groups have become in negotiations with lenders, which are eager to win a slice of the big fees being generated by the recent buy-out binge. Borrowing costs have fallen as spreads have narrowed sharply.Henry Kravis, a KKR co-founder, told a conference in Canada this week that the flood of capital in the world’s debt markets meant the buy-out business was in “a golden era” that was not going to end soonCov-lite deals account for 36 per cent of loans sold to institutional investors so far this year, against 1.3 per cent in 2005. This fast growth has triggered warnings from top investors. Anthony Bolton, Fidelity’s former star fund manager, last month warned such lending was “only a question of when rather than if” things would go wrong. A London-based lawyer specialising in private equity Wednesday compared it to “pass the parcel, with a time bomb”.
433;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-23T19:34:53Z;Punching high;;When he was a banker in the 1990s Guy Hands had a reputation as a financial innovator who punched above his comfortable weight.It is a reputation he has fought fiercely to keep in the highly competitive world of private equity, where he has lost out in recent attempts to bid for Thames Water and Alliance Boots. He has a penchant for the complicated and risky “take-private” deal. Yet, this week, he fought off competition to secure a recommendation from EMI for his £3.2bn bid.“He loves the chase and he loves winning the deal,” says a man close to him. A shaggy-haired, karaoke enthusiast – though friends says he can barely hold a note – he is regarded as a one-man band as the major owner of his Terra Firma. Like the self-made Jon Moulton at Alchemy, he is much more fun and candid than the average private equity executive. Rather oddly for a private equity executive looking to buy publicly listed companies, Mr Hands makes great play of the fact that he typically ditches management teams in the companies he buys. Although the signs look good for some, the father of four will have time to contemplate the EMI team’s future this summer when he relaxes on his Tuscan estate.People column

Dawn Airey’s appointment as the head of ITV production, distribution and content returns her to where she started her career. It also reunites her with ITV executive chairman Michael Grade, under whom she worked at Channel 4 in the 1990s. She defied his veto on a comedy series, on the grounds of a poor script. Father Ted became a hit.Ms Airey – who describes herself as “feisty, fair, fun” – is admired by those who have worked both under and above her. Her weakness may be her readiness to follow instinct. “She shoots from the hip before her brain engages,” says one TV executive. Perhaps this explains her decision to join a production start-up, Iostar, which went into liquidation. Born in Preston, with houses in Chiswick and Oxford, the 46-year-old brought glamour to Sky when she ran its channels until last year. Ms Airey is “obsessed” with ITV’s Coronation Street and knows all the story lines. Often found in The Ivy, at the weekend she is on the sofa on front of the TV with Jacquie Lawrence, her partner.

435;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-21T19:14:07Z;Market tunes in for EMI bid battle;;The rally in EMI’s share price on Monday night – up 23p to 271p and pitching it higher than Terra Firma’s recommended offer of 265p – suggested an imminent bid battle for the UK music group.Although the price seemed “fully priced” for other private equity groups looking at EMI to match, investors were waiting to see whether Warner Music, which is led by Edgar Bronfman Jr and has also been conducting due dilligence, would enter the fray.“It is the end game [for EMI] now,” said Lorna Tilbian, analyst at Numis Securities.Led by Guy Hands, Terra Firma’s offer has come as a surprise to people in the music industry. Mr Hands comes fresh from his spurned bid for Alliance Boots, and his past deals have been based around property and utilities. However, according to people close to the situation, the private equity group has been looking at EMI for the last two years.Music publishing assets, with copyright agreements and loyalty payments, have always been attractive assets for private equity groups. Recorded music arms on the other hand, have been seen as unsuitable for private equity ownership due to the volatile revenue stream.But despite expectations that any private equity buyer would break up the group and sell the recorded music side to a trade buyer, Terra Firma is understood to be seeking to keep EMI together.It will securitise the music publishing assets – a plan already announced by EMI’s management earlier this year. On the recorded music side, Terra Firma is expected to embark on a “substantial” restructuring exercise, especially in the US market where EMI has failed to make inroads.Those close to Terra Firma say the company felt confident that it could get right the balance of restructuring, revenue, declines of physical sales and the growth in digital music sales.“It was a matter of [Terra Firma] being comfortable with the recorded side – how long it would be for physical record sales to stabilise and digital music to take over,” says one person who knows Terra Firma well.He also emphasises that it would not all be about cost-cutting – there will be investment into the recording business. The UK has been the creative centre for EMI, and Mr Hands wants to build on that strength.Warner has always been regarded as the logical partner for EMI.However, an acquisition by Warner would face the risk of an investigation from Brussels, which is reviewing the merger between Sony and BMG and Universal’s acquisition of BMG’s music publishing assets.People close to EMI’s board on Monday said that Warner would need to make a knock-out offer of 300p a share or higher.
436;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-18T21:45:49Z;Private equity elite to face grilling;;Five of Europe’s top buy-out executives face a public political grilling on June 20 after being summoned to appear before the influential Commons Treasury Select Committee inquiry into private equity.It will be the first time titans of private equity will be forced to be accountable to UK politicians in this type of public hearing, which is expected to attract MPs, union members, private equity professionals and the media.Damon Buffini, managing partner of private equity group Permira – targeted by the GMB union over jobs cuts at the AA motoring organisation and Birds Eye frozen foods – was this week “invited” to attend, as was Dominic Murphy of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which has agreed the £11bn takeover of FTSE 100 retailer Alliance Boots.Some of the 14 committee members, led by chairman and Labour MP John McFall, are expected to take a tough line about the industry’s increasingly powerful role in the economy.Philip Yea of 3i, David Blitzer of Blackstone and Robert Easton of Carlyle are also due to attend.The buy-out chiefs are likely to be quizzed about the aptness of the current tax regime for private equity, the regulatory environment and excessive use of leverage to fund deals.“It is a crucial time for the private equity industry, particularly the large buy-out groups that attract a lot of the negative attention, to set out their case,” one private equity executive said.Mr Murphy may face questions about KKR’s talks with the Alliance Boots pension trustee body, which represents 67,000 members. The buy-out group is yet to agree terms with the trustee body, which is asking for £1bn in cash and new security. “Lots of MPs have been in touch with the [Boots] trustees and asked to be kept informed because it [the agreement] is a huge precedent,” a person close to the talks said.Brooks Newmark, Conservative MP and committee member, was a partner of Apollo Management, the US buy-out group. His presence is seen as a counterpoise to MPs wary of private equity.

A former Salomon Brothers banker and Investcorp buy-out artist, Mr Huth has been with KKR for eight years, working on several large transactions such as last year’s purchase of Philips’s semiconductors division.■ Marc Lipschultz, 38, heads KKR’s energy and natural resources group, and was a key figure in the firm’ s $45bn deal to acquire TXU, the Texas-based energy group, in February. Previously at Goldman Sachs, the Harvard Business School graduate joined KKR 12 years ago.■ Scott Nuttall, 33, is the youngest member of KKR’s new generation. But the head of the firm’s financial services group, who led last month’s $29bn planned takeover of First Data, the credit card processing group, has already been at the firm for 10 years. Mr Nuttall, who started his private equity career at Blackstone, also sat on the board of Willis, the insurance broker, while it was owned by KKR.■ Dominic Murphy, 40, heads KKR’s health care and consumer products industry team in Europe, and is a leading dealmaker on the $20bn acquisition of Alliance Boots. The Liverpool University graduate only joined KKR in 2005 after working at 3i and Cinven, two European private equity groups.■ Brian Carroll, 35, is the consumer products and chemicals head in New York, and most recently engineered the $8bn acquisition of Harman, which featured one of the earliest uses of “stub equity” in the current private equity boom. Mr Carroll , a Stanford MBA graduate, joined KKR a decade ago from DLJ.■ Joseph Bae, 35, was dispatched to Hong Kong in late 2005 to pioneer KKR’s move into Asia. Of Korean descent, Mr Bae has been at the firm for 10 years since joining from Goldman Sachs. One of his largest deals while still in New York was the takeover of PanAmSat, the US satellite company.■ Michael Calbert, 44, heads the retail team from Menlo Park, California (the homebase of co-founder George Roberts) and was the lead KKR executive on the $6.6bn buy-out of Toys R Us in 2005. This year, the former Arthur Anderson consultant helped negotiate the $7bn acquisition of Dollar General, one of America’s largest discounters. Mr Calbert joined KKR seven years ago.■ Todd Fisher, 41, co-founded KKR’s London office in 1999, and is currently head of its UK business and the European chemicals and financial services team. Mr Fisher, a Wharton MBA graduate, joined KKR in the early 1990s from Goldman Sachs and Drexel Burnham Lambert.■ Alexander Navab, 41, joined KKR in the early 1990s from James D. Wolfensohn Inc and has emerged as the top executive in the firm’s media and communications division. Mr Navab was one of the lead dealmakers involved in KKR’s acquisition of Dutch media company Nielsen, formerly known as VNU.■ Adam Clammer, 36, is a former Morgan Stanley banker who helps lead KKR’s technology business out of Menlo Park. Mr Clammer joined KKR 10 years ago, and worked on the $11bn acquisition of SunGard Data Systems, the financial services software group, in 2005.
438;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-14T20:38:37Z;A private dose of tough love;;When Charles Lazarus opened his first children’s store in 1948, Henry Kravis, then four-years-old, was a potential customer.Nearly 60 years later, Toys “R” Us – the chain founded by Mr Lazarus to cater for baby-boomers – was reunited with one of the most successful children of that generation.In March 2005, Mr Kravis’s Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, together with fellow private equity group Bain Capital and Vornado Realty Trust, a property group, put an end to Toys “R” Us’s two tumultuous decades as a listed company by clinching a $6.6bn buy-out.Since then, KKR and its allies have been busy applying their unique blend of financial engineering and managerial discipline to turn around a company that had lost touch with both its customers and its rivals.Although a long way from Mr Lazarus’s credo – “retailing should be fun” – the tough love administered to Toys “R” Us by its new owners was a classic example of the modus operandi pioneered by KKR and adopted by many of its peers.It also offers a glimpse of what another retailer – Britain’s Alliance Boots, the country’s largest drugstore chain – could expect following its recent £11.1bn ($22bn) takeover by KKR.Faithful to the buy-out industry adage that preparations for a sale, or “flip”, of a company begin on the day it is acquired, KKR typically lays out an aggressive “100-day” plan to address the most pressing issues.KKR declined to comment, but people familiar with its inner workings say the plan is a form of corporate shock therapy: a way to identify quickly and close the most glaring gaps in the company’s strategies and finances.In the case of Toys “R” Us, KKR, Bain and Vornado immediately replaced the entire board with their appointees and poached a senior manager from one of its fiercest rivals, the mega-store chain Target, to be chief executive.Within months the new team took drastic action, sanctioning the closure of 75 stores, more than 10 per cent of the group’s US footprint, with the loss of some 3,000 jobs.The moves underline the ability of private equity groups to enact rapid, and often painful, measures once the company is out of the public spotlight and no longer has to contend with stock market investors.These radical restructurings are usually enforced by a taskforce of KKR operatives, overseen by senior partners at 9 West 57th St, its imposing Central Park-facing headquarters.Management consultants from Capstone, the in-house advisory firm KKR revamped in 1999 are also seconded to companies during the 100-day plan to help the KKR executives with the early “heavy lifting”.Such expertise does not come cheap.According to Toys “R” Us’s latest annual report, for example, the retailer will pay its private equity owners $15m a year for up to a decade for “management and advisory services”. Leveraging the company up with debt can also be burdensome, though the hands-on approach of most private equity groups is a direct consequence of the high-stakes game they play with their companies’ balance sheets. Loading a heavy debt burden on their takeover targets enables buy-out groups to maximise their returns once they sell out.The latest figures show an annual $537m interest payment at Toys “R” Us.This financial high-wire act fuels KKR’s hunger to make its money work fast. KKR and other buy-out groups typically convene board meetings once a month, rather than four times a year like most listed companies. Board discussions are intense and to the point.“It is not easy to be the chief executive of a private equity-owned company with five or six self-appointed ‘Masters of the Universe’ telling you what to do every day,” says one buy-out executive.Each company’s performance is evaluated on a monthly basis by KKR’s powerful portfolio committee. Chaired by Mr Kravis and/or his partner George Roberts, the committee divides KKR-owned companies into three baskets: the good performers, those on the watch list and ones in need of immediate attention.Currently, no more than two or three of KKR’s 30-plus companies are believed to be in the dreaded third category. To keep it that way, the overlords of West 57th St pay painstaking attention to one metric above all else: cash generation.While a private equity owner may be happy to absorb post-tax losses for a while, a sharp swing downwards in cash flow is almost certain to cause a downgrade of a company’s standing in KKR’s three-tier system and set alarm bells ringing.Despite the aura of invincibility that currently surrounds KKR and some of its peers, the system used to restructure companies is the result of years of trial and error, exemplified by the paltry returns it reaped on one of its biggest deals: the $25bn takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1989.At KKR, the various iterations of the firm’s internal structure are referred to as “versions”: a term that evokes the see-sawing dynamics of the technology industry.In the firm’s parlance, Version One, in 2000, was the move to divide the staff along 16 industry groups, a departure from the generalistic approach of the past that seemed necessary after a few high-profile investments, including Regal Cinemas, turned sour.Four years later came Version Two: the number of industry groups was narrowed from 16 to nine to make sure a slow period in one sector would not leave too many KKR executives idle. The current version, which coincided with the boom in deal-making of the past two years, is described internally as “the creativity phase”: a search for new sectors and new techniques to invest the huge cash pile at KKR’s disposal. (See Part 1 of this series at www.ft.com/kkr.)And yet, KKR’s innovative approach to its stewardship of companies is anything but plain sailing.Toys “R” Us, for example, lost $384m in the year to January 2006, mostly as a result of costs related to the buy-out. It swung back into an $85m profit in the year to February 2007 but in a recent regulatory filing said it had been forced to delay its annual report due to a “material weakness in its internal controls”.The company said it would file its annual report by May 21 and declined further comment.The delay prompted Diane Shand at Standard & Poor’s, one of the few analysts who still follow the company, to warn that its credit rating, already at junk bond level, could be downgraded.She also remains sceptical about the company’s operations. “We need to see the [core] toy business turn, but I am not sure we will,” she says.Mr Kravis’s challenge is to prove that KKR can use its financial might and managerial savvy to ensure that another difficult case does not join the small number of KKR failures.
439;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-13T21:53:48Z;KKR’s spending spree raises questions;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has become by far the most active firm in the booming private equity industry in 2007, sealing $122.5bn worth of deals since January, more than it secured in the previous two years combined.Including the record $45bn buy-out of TXU, the Texas-based energy group, and the $20bn takeover of Alliance Boots, the UK drug store chain, KKR has grabbed a 44.1 per cent share of all global private equity deal volumes in 2007, according to Dealogic. This compares with its near-20 per cent average share of global buy-out volumes since the beginning of 2004.But its spending spree has raised questions about whether KKR is splashing too much money too quickly, given that several of the firm’s chief rivals, including Steve Schwarzman’s Blackstone, are much less active.“I think they [KKR] have definitely become more aggressive, even in their pricing,” says one senior investment banking executive.The acquisition spree from KKR reflects a belief that the current health of credit markets makes it an ideal time to spend the war-chest worth billions of dollars accumulated by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, the veteran financiers and co-founders.Marc Lipschultz, one of KKR’s most senior executives, says: “Most of our deals are large and complex, the result of proprietary ideas that have been worked on for years and years.”Blackstone, which is gearing up to go public on the New York Stock Exchange as early as next month, has struck less than $15bn worth of deals this year, although the firm is involved in a number of auctions that could rapidly lift that figure.According to Dealogic, KKR deals have accounted for more than twice the deal volume of the private equity unit of Goldman Sachs, the second most active buy-out fund, with $56.2bn worth of transactions.Fort Worth-based TPG, New York-based JC Flowers and London-based Permira have also been relatively active this year, as have investment banks such as Citigroup, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley, which have been writing more equity for leveraged buy-outs.KKR has also been studying an initial public offering and other ways to take advantage of the industry boom. But it appears less likely than some of its peers to move rapidly towards that goal, although it did raise a new $5bn fund last year in a public offering on the Amsterdam bourse.As well as striking several large and high profile deals, KKR has also been aggressively pursuing an Asian expansion, which it launched in late 2005 and is being accompanied by a dedicated fund for transactions in the region.For decades, KKR had dominated the private equity industry, making huge profits from buy-outs during good times such as the junk-bond-fuelled merger frenzy of the 1980s and emerging intact, if wounded, from tough times such as the collapse of the dotcom boom.Most famously, KKR sealed in 1989 the $30bn takeover of RJR Nabisco, immortalised in the best-seller Barbarians at the Gate.

441;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Russian roulette of bridge equity;;Next time an investment bank is asked to provide a private equity client with some bridge equity, they should think very seriously about saying no.This is the stand Merrill Lynch took on Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’ £11.1bn buy-out of Alliance Boots. The bank had both an advisory and a debt finance role, but was the only one out of seven not to participate in the bridge.With the private equity crowd threatening to pull other lucrative mandates from those banks reluctant to underwrite the equity, no wonder their nerves are shot.True, at one time or another, all investment banks have to provide clients with competitive, low-margin products to keep them sweet.Two years ago, many rushed into block trades, whereby the banks sold large chunks of shares on behalf of governments and large companies.The banks would buy the stock themselves at the outset and take it on to their books. If all went well, they could make a profit. If it didn’t, they were left holding a large slug of stock.But bridge equity may be one product innovation too far and it is dangerous for private equity to brand those banks that choose not to participate as cowards.Indeed, the bigger and more complex the deal, the more banking firepower is needed, so in the end, it is unlikely that those banks that refuse to provide one product will be frozen out of future deals.It is all beginning to look like the Russian roulette scene in The Deer Hunter in which the Vietcong forced their American captives to play the “one shot kill” for their amusement and made bets on who would die first.Instead of risking their lives with a lethal bullet, the investment banks are being forced to wager their balance sheets – and all for a paltry 1 per cent underwriting fee.Other banks might try to argue that they can easily place the equity, even if it is the private equity client that dictates who to sell to first. But in a market as frenzied as this, there will eventually be one difficult private equity deal where the bank is left holding the equity and trying to plug the hole blown through its books.lina.saigol@ft.com
442;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-09T19:28:59Z;EasyJet inherits a credibility problem;;Investors did not trust EasyJet when it denied it would follow rival Ryanair and issue a profit warning in 2004. They were vindicated when a profit warning ensued. No wonder investors are taking the low-cost airline’s latest reassurances about its business with a pinch of salt.Downbeat comments from many of Europe’s low-cost carriers has savaged share prices across the sector in the past week. EasyJet has been badly hit. Its stock has fallen 17 per cent. Much of the decline happened on Wednesday, when it said current trading was a little softer than envisaged.Yet EasyJet has stressed that it still expects to lift pre-tax profits by at least 40 per cent this year – a target in place since November.When a company’s shares fall this rapidly, the market is signalling that it expects a full-blown profit warning before long. That is forgivable given EasyJet’s history. Investors saw 25 per cent wiped off the company’s market value three years ago when it eventually admitted it was experiencing similar challenges to Ryanair. EasyJet has been under new management since December 2005, but the team seems to have inherited the old credibility problem.The reality is that the airline industry is cyclical and a downturn is probably due about now, according to research by JPMorgan. EasyJet flagged six months ago that it would encounter headwinds later in 2007. And it always faced demanding comparisons against the impressive performance it turned in last year. Up to now, investors have ignored these signs that the business might slow, preferring to buy the shares on momentum.The penny has now dropped that conditions are deteriorating and it is echoing loudly round the stock market. Whether or not EasyJet ends up issuing the rumoured profit warning, an avalanche of good news from the sector looks unlikely this year. Against that backdrop, it is hard to see the sector’s upward momentum of the past two years continuing. If momentum is not travelling upwards, that probably means it will go the other way.Boots on both feetShareholders in Alliance Boots might think that the £11bn takeover offer by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is an opportunity for a clean exit at a decent price. If so, they should be aware of the risk that they could unwittingly become investors in the buy-out too.KKR and Stefano Pessina, the company’s deputy chairman, are contributing only about 60 per cent of the equity in the proposed deal. The rest will be syndicated to other investors.Were this a conventional equity placing in the stock market, it would be a pretty sizeable transaction. The proposed deal values the equity at £1.4bn. Only four UK share placings have been bigger than that in the past three years, according to Thomson Financial. The placing would encounter resistance because the syndicating banks would be trying to flog the company back to fund managers who had just sold out. This was a problem encountered by 3i when it placed shares in its infrastructure fund in March. The fund contained an investment in AWG, which stock market investors had exited months earlier at a lower valuation.Of course, the difference with Alliance Boots is that the equity will be unlisted. That means the syndicating banks will be looking to sell it to investors who would not previously have held the company’s listed shares – for example, private-equity fund managers.The snag is that the ultimate owners of those private equity portfolios could also include pension funds, which have been increasing their exposure to private equity in recent years. So it is plausible that the Alliance Boots equity will end up back in some pension schemes whose public equity fund managers sold their Alliance Boots stock to KKR’s takeover bid.If that happens, those funds will in effect be buying the company off themselves – less the fees being paid to the many middlemen involved in this deal.Booker’s backIt is not often that a private company with £3bn of sales lands on Aim via a reverse takeover. In spite of the favourable reception enjoyed by Booker on Wednesday, this clever little deal looks likely to be a one-off.The transaction sees Booker acquire a smaller food wholesale rival, Blueheath, with which it has commercial synergies. It also obtains a stock market listing. This provides Booker’s multiple owners with the option to sell down their holdings unilaterally as they please.None of Booker’s existing investors are exiting just yet. This means they still have a chance of selling the company to a trade buyer or even a private firm. In the meantime, they get to enjoy the benefits of integrating Blueheath. If no takeover bids emerge, there is also the option of taking the company up to London’s main stock market – although that would require investors to sell down their holdings to increase the free float.It all sounds so neat. So why are reverse takeovers by private companies of Aim stocks so rare? Probably because there is a shortage of suitable targets. The Aim company needs to be suitably bite-sized. It also needs to be a genuinely good fit. There is no advantage in a private company buying an Aim company with which it has few synergies just to pinch the listing.So full marks to Booker for spotting the moment to pounce on Blueheath. But Aim-listed companies looking to be bought at a premium should not get too excited. If they want to fetch a good price, they will still have to make a case on the merits of their business, rather than their listing.chris.hughes@ft.com
443;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-09T14:59:08Z;Pessina and KKR shore up Boots bid;;Alliance Boots gave details of the funding of its buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and deputy chairman Stefano Pessina which showed that AB Acquisitions, the buyout vehicle, has borrowed £8.2bn to finance its bid.AB Acquisitions has also arranged a revolving credit facility of up to £820m which will be used to finance working capital requirements and general corporate purposes such as interest repayment due under the interim facilities agreement.Barclays Capital, Unicredit, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Royal Bank of Scotland are mandated lead arrangers for the debt financing.KKR, the private equity company and Mr Pessina are paying £11.1bn for the healthcare to cosmetics and pharmacy chain in Europe’s largest leveraged buyout and the first ever leveraged buyout of a FTSE 100 company.KKR and Mr Pessina will both initially have a 32.3 per cent equity stake in AB Acquisitions each investing £1.27bn.Alliance Boots also gave details of payments to executives through share options once the takeover of the group goes ahead.Richard Baker, chief executive of Alliance Boots, will receive £6.54m while Mr Pessina will receive £820,539. Mr Pessina’s partner Ornella Barra will receive £530,938.The court meeting and extraordinary general meeting when Alliance Boots shareholders vote on the deal will be held on May 31.Shares in Alliance Boots, delisted from the London Stock Exchange on June 28, were flat in early afternoon trade at £11.22.
444;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investors are holding EMI’s recent record against it;;"Eric Nicoli, EMI’s chief executive, must be wondering why there is not yet a bidding frenzy around the music group’s shares. The board of Alliance Boots extracted a 40 per cent premium on the whiff of a counter-bid that never materialised. Hanson’s shares shot up 20 per cent on Thursday at the merest hint that the world’s cement-makers would all throw their hard hats into the ring for the building materials group.Yet although EMI now seems to have three private equity groups ready to pore over its books, the best the shares could manage was an 8 per cent jump to a level that is still lower than the 260p a share proposal from Warner Music, EMI’s perennial suitor, in March. Subtract nearly £1bn of EMI net debt from the £3bn price tag the buy-out teams have put on the company and it looks as though they would pay the same price as Warner. Private equity has the edge because a takeover from a non-competitor would not invite the regulatory scrutiny that has been blighting a Warner-EMI link-up. But still, if EMI considered the Warner approach inadequate, presumably the buy-out firms would have to do better.EMI itself has not stood still since March even if its share price has. The UK group has settled a lawsuit with Bertelsmann over the German company’s support for Napster, the online file-sharing service; it has become the first of the music majors to drop copyright protection on some tracks sold via Apple’s iTunes service; and it has suspended its dividend and made plans to securitise cash flow from its back catalogue.Mr Nicoli and the EMI board deserve credit for those actions and for finally having managed to bring potential private equity bidders together in a straight line for due diligence, run to a tight timetable. This auction might even end with shareholders being able to make a clear comparison between competing offers and to assess them against the radical but sensible steps EMI’s management is already taking. That would make it a shining exception to other recent takeover battles, often fought behind closed doors. But EMI shareholders’ capacity for disappointment has been tested so frequently that it would be brave to bet this early on a clean outcome, let alone one that generates a substantial premium for investors.Buy-outs and boardsFarewell, J Sainsbury. Hola, Altadis. An observer with a binary view of acquisition strategy might assume that the involvement of CVC Capital Partners, the European private equity firm, in a prospective counter-bid for Altadis, the Franco-Spanish tobacco group, is a €12.8bn “alternative” to a takeover of the UK supermarket chain. Not so. While a typical company might only consider one big takeover at a time, many buy-out firms operate on the basis of regional fiefdoms, each working on potential acquisitions – London on Sainsbury, Madrid on Altadis, for instance. Occasionally the parallel projects clash – Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’ bid for Alliance Boots doubtless irritated CVC, which at the time had KKR as one of the partners on its Sainsbury project – but most of the time the ability to manage parallel processes is an advantage.What CVC and PAI Partners may underline if they succeed in beating the UK’s Imperial Tobacco to an agreed bid for Altadis is the idea that continental Europe is a happier hunting ground than the UK for private equity firms wishing to buy listed companies.But even here, the boards of Alliance Boots and Countrywide, the estate agency, have been able to recommend buy-outs. The process has been far from orthodox, but perhaps the conventional wisdom that private equity firms will always be given short shrift by the boards of British public companies is starting to shift.New rites for a new CityThe Trial of the Pyx – the 825-year-old annual ceremony that tests that the Royal Mint’s coins are of regulation weight, diameter and composition – is an ancient City tradition. Its usefulness has long since been superseded but few would now wish it to disappear. A newer tradition, whose usefulness is as yet unproven, is the chancellor of the exchequer’s high-level group on financial services, a gathering of the industry and government’s finest that meets for the second time next Wednesday. John Healey, who as financial secretary to the Treasury stood in for the chancellor at Friday’s Trial of the Pyx, managed to link the two rites by using his few opening remarks to underline the government’s commitment to the success of the City.So far, so ritualistic. But perhaps there was more to the minister’s preamble this year, because, as he pointed out, the UK is preparing for “changes at the heart of government and Treasury”. This column has warned of the risk that, as prime minister, Gordon Brown may have to curry favour with supporters unsympathetic to City interests.Mr Healey on Friday described the bond with the Square Mile as “unshakeable” and the chancellor’s personal commitment as “unchanging”. That should be a promise, like the Mint’s coins, that City sceptics can take to the bank. But they should still make sure next week that they get an eighth-century Pyx-style commitment to test its value regularly.andrew.hill@ft.com"
445;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-03T20:30:17Z;Boots trustees demand £1bn for pensions;;Trustees to the Alliance Boots pension scheme are demanding about £1bn from its would-be private equity owners to cover a shortfall in the retirement plan that was described by the company only a day earlier as having a small surplus.The trustees, whose estimate of the shortfall is contained in a letter to members to be sent shortly, are understood to be seeking as much as £500m in an up-front cash payment from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Stefano Pessina, the deputy chairman, who joined forces to take the company private.Advisers to the buy-out vehicle, AB Acquisitions, said they did not think the new estimate of the deficit would be a deal-breaker. Alliance Boots remained upbeat on Thursday about prospects for agreeing a deal with the trustees and said discussions were continuing.The announcement comes as the Pensions Regulator issued a warning to trustees about the need for robust negotiations when a leveraged bid for a solvent employer significantly weakened the ability of the employer to make cash contributions in the future.KKR and Mr Pessina will be distributing a circular about the offer to shareholders – possibly by this weekend. It was the prospect of this circular that prompted the trustee to make the negotiations public. However, the scale of the deficit is a shock for a scheme that was widely viewed to be among the most conservatively funded of that of any UK company.In the letter, John Watson, chairman of the scheme, wrote: “The trustee’s current estimate of the scheme’s funding deficit on this basis is approximately £1bn, which we believe should be met by a combination of a cash injection to be paid over a number of years and appropriate new security.”The sharp shift in the scheme’s reported fortunes are largely the result of changes in assumptions about longevity and investment returns. It is understood that the bidders have demanded more information from the pension fund trustees to support their assertion that there is a £1bn black hole in the fund.The last valuation, in March 2004, uses assumptions about life expectancy now widely viewed as unrealistically short. Even without a change in the employer’s covenant, trustees would have been seeking funding for a £350m shortfall arising from the use of more conservative assumptions.
446;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-03T19:21:10Z;Heidelberg has opened an auction for Hanson;;It is getting hard to build up a head of outraged steam at the run-up in a bid target’s share price before the official announcement of an approach. Thursday’s terse statement from HeidelbergCement, expressing interest in Hanson, added amazement to outrage. The UK building materials group’s shares have advanced by 60 per cent over the past 11 months. Can they really rise much further?Apparently, they can, but not necessarily just because rivals Cemex and Vulcan have recently struck deals in the US at high multiples. Alan Murray, Hanson’s hard-headed chief executive, has long said that direct comparisons with competitors are misleading. In fact, much of the value in Hanson’s US aggregates business comes down to location. The sheer weight of product that needs to be transported, and the difficulty of gaining permission to quarry close to metropolitan centres, give existing producers near-monopoly access to fast-growing regions.It would be understandable if Heidelberg were irritated about being outed on Thursday. Official notification of its interest in Hanson could well now provoke private equity bids. Buy-out firms could hammer Hanson down into so many fragments – bricks, concrete products, Australian operations – and, just like the late Lord Hanson himself, rely on the aggregate reserves to generate cash. If trade buyers – perhaps including Cemex, the competitor Mr Murray most fears – also decide to enter the fray, the rump of the old Hanson could conceivably celebrate 10 years since the break-up of the conglomerate by commanding another 200p on top of the £10.25 at which it closed on Thursday.At the right price, Hanson’s unsentimental management and board will probably be minded to sell. It could be quite an auction.It’s quiet – too quietWhen City folk applaud improved relations with government, they occasionally mention something that they don’t want mentioned: the system that allows non-domiciled UK residents to avoid tax on unremitted overseas income and gains.Before coming to power, the Labour party described this apparent anomaly as “indefensible” and Gordon Brown, chancellor of the exchequer, promised to close the loophole. As recently as 2003 the Treasury launched a review, since when: nothing.Can the silence last, and, if not, should it lead to action? The answer is no to the first and a conditional no to the second.No, it cannot last because, with Mr Brown on the brink of taking over as prime minister, the left of the Labour party is almost certain to unearth promises made before Tony Blair took power in 1997 and urge the new premier to fulfil the pledges his predecessor shelved. A tax anomaly that appears to favour some very rich foreigners makes a big target. It would also be odd if a new chancellor – even the City-friendly Ed Balls – did not seek a progress report on various ongoing reviews, including this one.But a heavy-handed clampdown on non-domiciled residents would be counter-productive for the UK financial services community (which accounts for two- thirds of the largest employers of such “non-doms”) and the wider economy.It would come just as competing financial centres, notably New York, are starting to fight back against London’s pre-eminence. At least one Swiss canton is said specifically to be stalking top earners at London-based hedge funds, promising them a haven in the Alps from which to oversee their UK operations.The condition for maintaining a light touch, however, must be that there is no abuse of the current tax regime. On this issue, at least, the system is only just meeting its objectives of fairness and clarity, even if it is encouraging competitiveness. The UK tax authorities are right, for instance, to pursue their campaign against the most distortive “dual contracts”, which use offshore associate companies to pay part of non-domiciled workers’ salaries.Silence has been golden for many top City employees, but if they are exploiting the situation to stash the gold elsewhere, they cannot expect it to endure.No capital injectionKohlberg Kravis Roberts and Stefano Pessina, partners in the buy-out of Alliance Boots, will need some of the group’s No 7 Protect and Perfect Beauty Serum for their furrowed brows if the stand-off with pension trustees drags on.The success of the serum – which returns to Boots this morning, having sold out on reports of its extraordinary efficacy – raises a question: is the wrinkle cream the “pot of gold” that underpinned the high price offered by KKR and Mr Pessina, Alliance Boots’ executive deputy chairman?An anonymous shareholder has suggested to the FT that the serum is a potential ”blockbuster” that could bring in annual sales of £500m. Alas, the truth is less spectacular. Richard Baker, Alliance Boots’ chief executive, points out that the entire No 7 range generates turnover of just £120m and a 100 per cent increase in serum sales would translate into £10m a year. Nice, but, for a company turning over nearly £14bn annually, hardly transformational – and certainly not enough to smooth over the spat with the pension trustees.andrew.hill@ft.com
447;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-03T19:04:40Z;Rolls-Royce helps drive FTSE 100 to 7-year high;;Rolls-Royce was among the biggest risers as the FTSE 100 powered to its highest closing level since September 2000.Shares in the aero-engine maker climbed 3.5 per cent to 500p after Merrill Lynch flagged the possibility of a 67 per cent dividend increase and share buy-back programme.RR is at present conducting a review of its finances to determine what its balance sheet should look like and if cash should be returned to shareholders.Having analysed various options, Merrill believes capital will be returned to RR investors via a raised dividend and buyback programme.“We conclude that one possible result is a hybrid of a steep increase to the dividend (up from 9.59p in 2006 to about 16p in 2007), followed by a 10 per cent annual increase thereafter, combined with a share buyback programme,” Merrill said.In the wider market, the FTSE 100 closed 53.3 points, or 0.8 per cent, higher at 6,537.8.The market was lifted by news of a possible bid approach for Hanson, up 20.7 per cent to a record high of £10.25, from HeidelbergCement, and strong corporate results from companies including Unilever, 3.9 per cent stronger at £16.16, and Royal Dutch Shell, 1.6 per cent better at £18.36.Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 improved 26.8 points, or 0.2 per cent, to close at a record high of 12,046.1.Barclays rose 3 per cent to 744½p on the view that it would be a takeover target for a US bank if it failed to win the battle for ABN Amro.That scenario looked more likely after a Dutch investor group won an injunction to prevent ABN selling LaSalle to Bank of America. That decision should pave the way for Royal Bank of Scotland, down 0.7 per cent to £19.63, to launch a counter bid for ABN.Hammerson rose 2.8 per cent to £16 after chairman John Nelson admitted to shareholders at their annual meeting that the property company could be a takeover target. However, Mr Nelson pledged not to sell out on the cheap and claimed Hammerson had the potential to double in size over the coming years.International Power provided the session’s speculative feature. Its shares rallied from early weakness to finish 0.1 per cent higher at 436¾p on rumours of a bid approach from Suez and an infrastructure fund owned by Macquarie, the Australian bank.Prudential added 5.6 per cent to 794p on fresh break-up hopes. These were triggered by a report that claimed an “unnamed fund” manager had written to the chairman of the life assurance group asking him to explain the board’s thinking on a possible break-up.Elsewhere, DSG International firmed 0.6 per cent to 165p. Analysts believe the option DSG has over Eldorado, Russia’s leading electrical goods retailer, could be worth a lot more than the market thinks. Under the terms of an agreement struck in 2005, DSG has the right to buy Eldorado for $1.9bn, providing it exercises an option to buy 10 per cent of the company before the end of this year. However, analysts believe Eldorado could be worth in excess of $4bn if it were listed on the Russian market.Alliance Boots bucked the trend, easing 0.3 per cent to £11.19½p after the trustees of its pension fund said they had failed to reach an agreement with KKR, the private equity group that has agreed to buy Boots for £11.1bn. The trustees want KKR to inject £1bn into the fund.Housebuilder Berkeley Group topped the FTSE 250 leaderboard. Its shares jumped 6.5 per cent to £18.30 after house broker UBS upgraded to “buy”, set a £20.82 price objective and predicted it would return cash to shareholders earlier than expected.Berkeley has pledged to hand £1.45bn to its investors by 2011.

448;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-02T21:14:52Z;Pensions setback for leveraged buy-outs;;Private equity firms seeking to buy British businesses will be dealt a blow on Thursday when the Pensions Regulator says that trustees have a duty to demand substantial assets up front to safeguard retirement benefits in the event of a leveraged buy-out.Guidance to be issued on Thursday will apply even to companies whose pension schemes appear well funded in accounting terms.The move will be seen as a tacit endorsement of the actions of the J Sainsbury trustees who, faced with a private equity consortium bid, insisted on £2bn advance assets to cover a deficit which, in acc­ounting terms, was less than £500m. It will also strengthen the negotiating hand of trustees when facing future buy-outs.The regulator will urge trustees to seek “clearance”, a procedure that relieves them of personal liability if the employer later be­comes insolvent leaving insufficient funds to pay promised benefits. The guidance could dent plans for leveraged buy-outs.The move comes amid a surge in highly leveraged bids for UK companies, including one agreed for Alliance Boots, where the UK pension scheme shows a small surplus in the company’s accounts issued on Wednesday.Charlie Massey, executive director for strategic development at the regulator, said the guidance was not specifically aimed at private equity deals. But he said a significant minority of trustees did not understand the need to re­view the employer’s covenant, which was significantly weakened when a new owner piled on debt.“We worried that if a scheme was funded at or above FRS 17 or IAS 19 [pension accounting standards] that the perception was that it was enough regardless of the covenant,” Mr Massey said. “We thought we ought to make it clear that if there is a significant weakening of the covenant, trustees should consider coming to us for clearance.”The watchdog is expected to advise trustees not to let hedge funds take over their scheme’s liabilities as it would relieve the employer of a legal obligation to cover shortfalls.Lombard comments:The Pensions Regulator’s attempt to put steel in the backbone of pension trustees is welcome, although it is likely to raise a groan from buy-out firms, which already have a tough time making leveraged public-to-private deals stick in the UK.It may look as though the regulator is stating the obvious. In recent cases, including the acquisition of Corus, the steel company, by India’s Tata Steel and the abortive buy-out of J Sainsbury, the retailer, by a private equity consortium, trustees did press for higher contributions and improved status in the hierarchy of creditors. They recognised that a change in ownership – and an increase in leverage – could increase the strain on employer covenants.Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, winner in the battle to buy Alliance Boots, is still negotiating with the target’s trustees. The firm may yet have to stump up a higher pension contribution, even though Richard Baker, Alliance Boots’ chief executive, insisted yesterday that the schemes were “well-funded”.The regulator is also hoping his message will reach smaller companies, where trustees are sleepier and takeovers happen away from the white heat of publicity. They deserve all the support they can get.Yet even in high-profile cases, bidders have shown a surprising nonchalance about the challenge posed to their bid arithmetic by pensions. In part, that reflects the inadequacy of accounting standards that mask the potential liabilities of pension funds. It is not only trustees who need to stay awake.andrew.hill@ft.com
449;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ABN hosts a dance where no one wants to hold hands;;"If there isn’t already a Dutch folk dance in which partners circle each other warily while the band plays the introductory bars of the melody again and again, there ought to be. The ABN Amro quadrille is being performed against a background of legal threats – the dancers start in traditional dress and everybody ends up in a suit – but it is reaching a climax.If a Dutch court today allows ABN to go ahead with its sale of LaSalle bank in the US to Bank of America, the consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland will have to decide whether to lodge a counter-offer for LaSalle – and, by implication, for the whole of ABN – by Sunday.This is the scenario that ABN would prefer. RBS would make its bid for LaSalle conditional on a takeover of the whole of ABN. But, as Rijkman Groenink, ABN’s chief executive, made clear on Tuesday, he and fellow board-members would require more detail of the financing of the consortium’s bid before even starting to talk to the Scottish bank and its partners.If the court decides the Dutch investor group bringing the case is right and the LaSalle deal should have been put to a shareholder vote, a new, more drawn-out dance is likely to begin, during which RBS and partners will have more time to frame an offer for ABN, while litigation rages.But, legal wrangling apart, would it even make sense, in the first scenario, for RBS, Santander of Spain and the Belgo-Dutch group Fortis to reveal their hand, setting off speculation about asset sales and rights issues? Only if they could be reasonably sure that ABN would accept the conditional offer for LaSalle and start discussions about the overall takeover. At the moment, they have no such certainty. But at the same time, if RBS and friends abandoned their bid tonight, they would end the dance and leave ABN in the arms of Barclays.Duty still calls for the CityThe august City institutions and associations behind the latest study of the benefits of abolishing stamp duty on shares are optimistic if they think the conclusions will prompt a cut in duty in the near future.Gordon Brown will always jump at an instant money-raising gambit based on sketchy long-range assumptions – cf. abolition of pension tax credits. But it will be hard to convince him to renounce a sure-fire £3bn in tax for forecast replacement income of £1.27bn-£4.1bn.The Treasury’s official response to the Oxera report made the position abundantly clear: “no evidence” that stamp duty affects share ownership; “misleading” to suggest it has a big impact on pension fund values; and, crucially, abolition would lead to tax increases elsewhere or cuts in public spending. In other words: don’t bother me, I’m preparing to make new and more politically useful friends.Still, nice try – and on the principle that you only get what you really want from government by asking for more, there may be a fall-back worth pursuing. That would be a cut in stamp duty on shares, sufficient to persuade spread-betters and accumulators of contracts for difference that it is worth holding the underlying security rather than an untaxed simulacrum.As an objective, that may not play as well on the barricades, but it could be easier to achieve.Beware, hidden liabilitiesThe Pensions Regulator’s attempt to put steel in the backbone of pension trustees is welcome, although it is likely to raise a groan from buy-out firms, which already have a tough time making leveraged public-to-private deals stick in the UK.It may look as though the regulator is stating the obvious.

We’ve got a couple of very hot irons in the fire which we hope to be able to say more about tomorrow morning, if not sooner. But in the meantime Sir Nigel Rudd isn’t helping to make today any more fun.He came on the Alliance Boots analysts’ call in the same week that he had called most of them “stupid” in our pages but then refused to discuss the matter publicly. ”[My presence on the call] is not a reaction to my comments in the FT but I am happy to discuss them off line, but I don’t think it is appropriate to discuss it in this call,” he said. Only Richard Ratner had the gumption to have a dig at him. ”Ratty here,” he said before asking his question, “or the rather stupid analyst at Seymour Pierce.” Chief executive Richard Baker had some good things to say about Alliance Boots’s performance.

451;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-05-02T08:26:11Z;Merger benefits show through at Boots;;The benefits of the merger which formed Alliance Boots last July began to show through in full-year results announced on Wednesday. Richard Baker, chief executive, said “we thought the merger would create a very attractive business” and the current bid for the company “provides evidence that’s what we’ve done”.Alliance Boots last month recommended shareholders accept a £11.39p a share, or £11.1bn, offer from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Stefano Pessina, the deputy chairman of the health and beauty chain.Mr Baker sought to distance himself from remarks made in the Financial Times by Sir Nigel Rudd, Alliance Boots’ chairman, that analysts were “stupid” not to have seen the value in the £7.78bn merger last year. Before the recent bid approach Alliance Boots shares were trading at 815p. In early trading on Wednesday the shares rose 1½p to £11.22.Mr Baker said of last year’s merger: “I think it was pretty well explained. Nigel’s got his views. I’m not going to comment on those.”Sir Nigel joined a conference call for analysts, saying he felt it was appropriate to be available for questions – although in the event he was not asked any – given the level of interest in the company at the moment. However, he made it clear that he was not going to comment on his FT interview.”[My presence on the call] is not a reaction to my comments in the FT…I am happy to discuss them off line, but I don’t think it is appropriate to discuss it in this call,” he said.Mr Baker also brought welcome news to customers unable to buy Boots No 7 Protect and Perfect Beauty Serum after academic research showing the product worked in repairing fine wrinkles caused a rush to stores. He said Boots had “had to step up production enormously” and promised that by Friday the product would be back in stock in stores. He said there were 100,000 people on a waiting list to buy the product and a “heavy” national advertising campaign would be launched to promote it further.Results for the year to March 31 were “very strong” and the group was “successfully delivering our key priorities at the time of the merger.”Sales on a pro forma basis – as if the two groups had been combined throughout – rose 3.6 per cent to £14.6bn, and trading profits by 6.3 per cent to £641m. Earnings were up 11.5 per cent to £467m, with earnings per share ahead by 11.4 per cent to 48.7p.On that basis the £11.39 bid price puts an exit p/e ratio of 23.4 on the group.Mr Baker said £20m of savings had been achieved from the merger and he was confident of making the full £100m of annual savings planned. The group said it expected “the good trading performance it has seen in 2006-07 to continue in the current financial year.One highlight was that the Boots branded health and beauty business increased trading profit and margins for the first time in five years. Meanwhile, a trial of rebranding the community pharmacies which had been owned by Alliance Unichem as “your local Boots pharmacy” had resulted in improved results and was now being applied across the chain.The retail division in total increased sales by 4.2 per ent to £6.58bn and trading profits by 6.4 per cent to £502m.In the wholesale division sales rose 3.9 per cent to £9.01bn and trading profits by 10.1 per cent to £186m. Mr Baker said the business in Russia had been established and the group was now setting up a joint venture in China.
452;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-30T22:52:00Z;Analysts won’t wear Boots dunce’s cap;;Sir Nigel Rudd could scarcely have chosen a more sensitive time to fire his broadside against City research. He is expected to face an army of retail analysts on Thursday when he hosts the Alliance Boots annual results presentation.So it was highly provocative to dismiss them as “stupid” for undervaluing the health and beauty group until it attracted takeover interest from private equity in February.The company’s analysts certainly have a case to answer. They, in common with shareholders, voiced scepticism about the £7.8bn merger of the Boots retail chain and Alliance Unichem, the drugs wholesaler, when Sir Nigel proposed the transaction in 2005.Citigroup’s retail analysts spoke for many when they wrote: “We fear that this deal has serious executional, managerial and possibly even regulatory risks. It is not the combination of two highly successful, high-return entities.”Yet anyone who listened to the analysts and shunned the shares upon the deal’s completion last July would have missed out on a 45 per cent profit from the recently agreed £11bn, or £11.39-a-share, joint takeover bid from KKR and the company’s executive deputy chairman, Stefano Pessina.KKR’s offer came after its earlier £10.40-a-share bid, also recommended to shareholders by Sir Nigel, looked at risk of being trumped by Terra Firma, a rival private equity firm.The analyst community is already marshalling its arguments against the straight-talking Sir Nigel, although only a few number-crunchers are bold enough to take issue with him in public.“Nigel Rudd is entitled to his views,” says Richard Ratner of Seymour Pierce. “Obviously if [the share price] went up we got it wrong. [But] I’m not going to bare my chest on this one. I think on fundamentals if the bid hadn’t come the price would be less than £8. He is very lucky he got a bid.”In fact, few analysts had price targets for the stock as high as £8-a-share before KKR’s interest emerged.One analyst describes Sir Nigel’s comments as “typically arrogant”, adding: “He was the one who recommended £10.40 and said ‘Oh, another 99p!’. He’s not exactly covered himself in glory.”And according to one highly rated follower of the retail sector, the research community had good reason to be cautious about Alliance Boots, since information flow from the company was poor.“Retail analysts were quite entitled to be sceptical,” he says. “You put two complicated businesses together and make a big complicated business – it’s not surprising the market wants to see a bit of evidence . . . The board] didn’t even take a stab at [putting a number on] revenue synergies.”One senior director responsible for research at a major brokerage firm says Sir Nigel was wrong to accuse analysts of missing the big picture – a reference to his comment that Alliance Boots’s analysts did not “sit back and say healthcare is a growing business, people are getting older, they need more medicine”.“Analysts spend an increasing amount of time understanding the macro- drivers of a company. Industries are more interlinked globally than they have been,” says the executive, who asked not to be named.It was pointed out that it was unfair to accuse analysts of undervaluing companies that receive generous takeover bids from private equity firms.“Eighteen months ago, there wasn’t a trillion dollars of private equity financing out there. The trouble is you don’t know which company private equity is going to land on next, and you cannot put a buy-out valuation on every company in your universe,” he says.“The willingness of private equity to move into the sort of transaction that we have seen lately, thanks to the cheap financing, has as­tounded even themselves. It is striking that they weren’t doing these deals two years ago when those companies were cheaper.”There was also criticism that Sir Nigel piled into analysts but was silent about the wider investor community, which showed little appetite for the stock. For months after the merger of Alliance Unichem and Boots was announced, the shares barely outperformed the FTSE 100 and underperformed the retail sector.“His comments suggest the job of the analyst is to make the decision to buy or sell. To say analysts are stupid without saying the market is stupid too is an odd comment. The decision to buy or sell is the investor’s.”Of course, it may be that the boardroom view of analysts is coloured by the tilt of their recommendations.At Asos, a retailer that is 100 times smaller than Alliance Boots but growing fast, analysts are very much in favour. Most analysts covering the stock are impressed with its proven ability to grow sales at a spectacular rate in spite of setbacks such as the Buncefield fuel depot explosion, which destroyed much of its stock.“We have quite a positive view of them,” says Nick Robertson, chief executive. “We find it hard to predict our business, so an analyst trying to follow it is on a hiding to nothing.”
453;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-30T18:31:26Z;Stupidity is not the only reason Boots was mispriced;;Chairmen and chief executives who rail against their company’s languishing share price risk sounding like husbands justifying an affair – I’m being taken for granted, the markets don’t understand me, and so on.At least Sir Nigel Rudd, who has accused the sell-side analysts that cover Alliance Boots of being “stupid”, can cite hard facts in support of his claim that the drugs wholesale and pharmacy company was misunderstood. As chairman, he last week agreed to sell the group to Stefano Pessina, its executive deputy chairman, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm, at a premium of more than 40 per cent to the undisturbed price at which about half the analysts were recommending a sell.Sir Nigel’s outburst captures the spirit of the times. Sell-side analysts and their bosses have been worrying about how to justify the research department’s existence ever since Eliot Spitzer stopped investment banks using analysts as cheerleaders for house deals. A wonderful internal e-mail from HSBC’s global head of equity research last year warned the bank’s analysts that their output was largely “worthless”, while Merrill Lynch’s head of research wrung her hands in March about the “Napsterisation” of sell-side opinions, which can be disseminated on the web seconds after publication. Analysts have tried to distinguish themselves by publishing bold predictions of deals that generally haven’t happened, or they have run with the pack – a safety-first approach only occasionally exposed by competitive bids, as in the case of Alliance Boots.In the same FT interview, Sir Nigel says institutional investors have “a lot of talent in-house” – adding to a widening myth that the buy-side are sharp-eyed geniuses and the sell-side are conflict-ridden dopes. But judged on the performance of Alliance Boots shares after last year’s merger between Alliance Unichem and Boots, institutions were also guilty of undervaluing the group’s prospects. Either all outside analysts were wrong about the company – or Sir Nigel and Mr Pessina weren’t explaining it well enough.Don’t just read the labelThe fact that another Kazakh mining company – Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) – is on the slipway to flotation in London will set the pulse of corporate governance activists racing.Kazakhmys – the copper miner whose chairman, Vladimir Kim, happens to own 18.8 per cent of ENRC – has come under heavy scrutiny since its initial public offering and has had to upgrade its governance to the strictest UK standards. ENRC is inviting the same attention, because it, too, intends to have a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange.The decision is partly driven by pride. The Kazakh government, ENRC’s largest single shareholder, wants Kazakh companies to have a strong presence in Europe’s financial capital. A full listing – as opposed to the issue of global depositary receipts preferred by most former-Soviet companies that come to London – should also allow ENRC to tap both the investor interest ignited by Kazakhmys and the analyst coverage that a main-market company warrants.Some UK fund managers are concerned that the London authorities’ use of “light touch” regulation to attract more companies risks devaluing the brand that is “London listing”. Bankers point out that investors make little distinction between the form of securities issued – primary, secondary, Aim – concentrating instead on fundamentals.In fact, for a risk market to thrive and endure, issuers and investors need to pay attention to both form and substance. Advisers, and the listing authorities, may be able to explain how to attach the label. But it is up to investors to decide whether what is inside the parcel is worth buying.Not yet the Famous FiveActions do speak louder than words. Within three days of the Financial Reporting Council’s tentative and conditional report last week on how to chip away at the dominance of the “Big Four” audit firms, two of the challengers – Grant Thornton and RSM Robson Rhodes – signed a deal to combine their operations in the UK. What is billed as a merger, so as not to frighten worried bean-counters at RSM, the smaller of the two, looks more like a takeover by Grant Thornton, which keeps its brand, supplies the chief executive of the combined company, and retains links to Grant Thornton’s international network.While both firms deserve points for disproving this column’s contention last week that the audit market still largely tolerates the status quo, their deal affects only one side of the supply-demand equation, and it lacks the strong international element necessary to attract many UK-based multinational clients.Barring intervention by a regulator to force change, blue-chip companies are still less likely to choose the fifth largest auditor in Britain, than one of the Big Four, all of which are still much bigger than Grant Thornton-RSM.The merging firms aim to establish greater credibility, not just in audit but in other services, in the hope that one day more boards of big companies will be comfortable enough to go the whole hog with Grant Thornton. It is a creditable ambition, but don’t hold your breath.andrew.hill@ft.com
454;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-29T21:30:34Z;Rudd rounds on ‘stupid’ City analysts;;"Sir Nigel Rudd has rounded on retail analysts, describing them as “stupid” for failing to see the value in Alliance Boots after last year’s £7.78bn merger of the retail chain with Stefano Pessina’s Alliance Unichem drugs wholesale business.In a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times, the chairman of Alliance Boots, who this month oversaw the sale of Boots to private equity, hit out at City analysts for failing to get to grips with the enlarged group.“When I did the Alliance Boots deal, everyone hated it. The greatest pleasure out of all of this has been the analysts,” said Sir Nigel. “I actually love that. They are so stupid most of them …they are very bright or stupid.“They write all this stuff, but they don’t sit back and say healthcare is a growing business, people are getting older, they need more medicine.“What I saw in Boots was a pharmacy … and what was more logical than merging with a chemist. And they didn’t get it.”Asked if he thought analysts were a waste of time, Sir Nigel said: “Yes, mostly. I think the buy-side shareholders have a lot of talent in-house and I think analysts in investment houses are there to buy and sell stock or assist the salesmen buying or selling stock. That is what buy-side people tell you; they read the analysis but they aim off from it.”Mr Pessina, executive deputy chairman, has repeatedly said his decision to take Boots private less than a year after the £7.78bn ($15.6bn, €11.4bn) merger was largely driven by the public market’s lack of understanding and undervaluation of the business. However, Sir Nigel said Boots’ success was not determined by the ownership structure. “I don’t buy this argument that you can’t be innovative and do difficult things as a public company, but that is the view Stefano has got. It is not my view.”In early March, just before Mr Pessina and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts announced a £9.7bn indicative offer (they have since agreed to pay £11.1bn), only four out of 21 analysts had the stock on buy, with 10 on a sell.Philip Dorgan, analyst at Panmure Gordon, who had Alliance Boots on a sell before the bid war, said there are “two sides to the equation”. “I have some sympathy with Nigel Rudd, but what he is saying is that we needed better understanding of Alliance Boots and that is part of his responsibility,” he said."
455;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-29T17:02:01Z;Curse of phantom bids amid deal boom;;"The busier investment bankers get, the more extreme their tactics become. So intense is this current deal boom that nervous bankers have been jumping at the sight of their shadows. Like Don Quixote mistaking windmills for evil giants, many are fighting phantom bids in their desperation to do deals.Take a look at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The US buy-out firm was so spooked by Terra Firma’s late entry into the bid battle for Alliance Boots that it increased its offer significantly. But with no real rival counter-offer on the table, KKR looked to be
bidding against itself.Two similar situations occurred last year. Tata Steel rushed to raise its bid for Corus after Brazil’s CSN hinted that it could make a counterbid for the UK steel group. Osprey Acquisitions, a consortium of international funds, revised an offer for AWG, the UK water utility, just on
whispers that Merrill Lynch was about to intervene. It never did.The pre-emptive strike has always been considered a risky tactic in mergers and acquisitions, so why are so many bankers turning to it now? One answer is they are under intense pressure to do deals.Trade buyers, terrified of missing out on key, strategic assets, feel the need to act quickly and aggressively by knocking the competition out cold. Private equity buyers, under duress to spend their billion-dollar funds, stump up the extra cash, ignoring the risk that they might overpay.For the bankers advising companies with an actual bid on the table, the skill lies in assessing how serious a potential counter-
bidder really is. What they must realise is that a last-minute, standard letter, sent by a rival to the target’s boardexpressing an interest, is often a windmill, not an evil giant.Investment bankers need to beware of playing the knight errant on behalf of clients. Shareholders are bound to punish companies that overpay because they fail to separate the deal from the delusion."
456;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
457;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-29T13:17:23Z;Tense times for a lucky general;;"A quick glance through Sir Nigel Rudd’s resumé and it becomes quite clear that the chairman of Alliance Boots is a man who likes to get things done – and is not shy about his achievements.He became Britain’s first chartered accountant under the age of 20 and made his first £1m in the mid-1970s when just 28. Last year he found himself in the unusual position of juggling three protracted deals in his role as chairman to Boots, the retailer, Pilkington, the glassmaker, and Pendragon, the car dealership.Now he is set to become the chairman who sanctioned Europe’s biggest leveraged buy-out, after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US private equity firm, won its £11.1bn bid battle for Alliance Boots last week. But he appears rather more dubious about this particular honour.“I don’t think selling the first FTSE 100 company and everything else is something you shout about and be proud about,” he says, sitting in the boardroom of Alliance Boots just above its flagship store on Oxford Street, as he reflects on the closing stages of the deal. “I like the public markets.”But if Sir Nigel is not puffed-up about selling the first FTSE 100 scalp to private equity, he is at least relieved that he has come out of the highly conflicted takeover battle with his reputation intact.When Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman, told Sir Nigel at the beginning of March that he wanted to take the business private, the chairman knew he was holding a tricky hand.Mr Pessina was his biggest shareholder, a boardroom insider and the mastermind behind Alliance Boots’ strategy. From an insider slot, he had teamed up with KKR. The deal looked sewn up, prompting cries from the City, London’s financial centre, that Mr Pessina was going to get Alliance Boots, and get it on the cheap.“Within minutes of reading that letter, I knew there were going to be huge issues involving conflicts of interest and there would be huge interest by the media and everybody else,” says Sir Nigel.He switches to the third person as he reflects on the implications for his standing in the City. “Actually, I thought the upside for Nigel Rudd was very limited. And the downside was huge in terms of reputational damage etc...there is very little upside and you have to do the best thing for shareholders.”For a veteran City figure who has spent the past decade chalking up a reputable profile as a chairman and non-executive director – he is also deputy chairman of Barclays and a non-executive at BAE Systems – losing his reputation in the latter stages of his career was unthinkable. “That is all I have got in business – reputation and integrity.”In the end, KKR bought Boots for £11.39 a share, after a rival consortium led by Terra Firma, the private equity firm, drove KKR to its limits. And Sir Nigel was off the hook. “I think the price we got was really excellent,” his round face cracking into full smile. Was it luck or skill? He breaks into laughter. “Well, there is an old expression. Give me a lucky general.”But, leaning in, Sir Nigel does admit that at times he felt “desperate”. When he agreed to open the books at £10.40, he was dogged by concerns.The seemingly unflappable chairman worried that, on the one hand, no one else would bid to drive the price higher, and on the other that if he did not sell to Mr Pessina and KKR, he would end up with a fractured business given Mr Pessina’s centrality to the group.“Having said it was a good price at £10.40, some people say [in retrospect] you are stupid because you didn’t realise the business was worth a lot more. But it wasn’t like that. I think £10.40 was a very, very good price.“I was wondering how I could get some competitive tension in. And knowing that they knew and I knew that £10.40-ish was a good price and the real worry was if I turned it down, then the management would have been left with the legacy of running the business with an offer turned down.”Sir Nigel, a keen huntsman – he is missing the index finger on his right hand from a shooting accident – then found himself as the prey rather than the predator.His luck changed when Guy Hands, founder of Terra Firma, came forward with an indicative price of £10.85. Better yet, he raised it – with conditions – to £11.26.Sir Nigel was back on the front foot. Recalling the transition, he becomes bullish again. “I knew two things. I knew Stefano was absolutely in love with the business . . . and the business without Stefano was inconceivable.“I also knew that KKR had got so close to the iconic deal of buying the first public FTSE 100 company, it is so important to their image and their PR to show that it is possible to do this. So the two partners were locked in a deathly embrace of having to do a deal. And it was my job – and Guy Hands helped me enormously – in getting them absolutely to put the top price on the table.”In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Sir Nigel knew he had got that price after Franklin Templeton, a long-term shareholder, agreed to sell its 6 per cent stake in the company for a whopping £11.39 a share. “I did actually [punch the air]. I knew it was successful when someone rang me at 1 am and I did go ‘yes’,” he puts on a victory voice and clenches his fist, “Yes! When the major shareholder decided that it was the right price, at that point I got the right price. That is when I had done a good job.”A multi-millionaire with homes in Derby, Belgravia and Portugal, Sir Nigel has come a long distance from his working-class roots in the north of England. He credits his ambitious temperament to his mother, who lived to see her son knighted in the 1990s.It was this “fearsome” parent who pulled him out of school before his 16th birthday and signed him up for an accountancy course. “She said to me: ‘I have never seen a poor accountant’.” He never went to university but instead pressed on with his career.The KKR deal is expected to be sealed as soon as August. Sir Nigel does not intend to bow out of business. He has managed to look good even as he sells off one of Britain’s most iconic brands. “Something has always got to interest me,” he says. “Can I add value and can I enjoy it? “I don’t want to spend the
rest of my active life going to meetings I don’t enjoy with people I don’t like. I don’t have to. That is the thing about wealth, it gives you options. It doesn’t necessarily make you happy, but it gives you options.”"

H&F will continue to own just over half the equity, with the repayment structured as a buy-back of preferred stock.Gartmore has performed better than H&F expected, helped by rising markets and strong growth at the hedge fund business.Indicative pricing on Friday suggested Gartmore would pay interest of 2 percentage points over Libor on the new seven-year debt, against 2.35 points on the debt it is repaying, which also carried covenants.Debt from VNU World Directories was the first of the covenant-lite deals in Europe earlier this year, followed by Trader Media. But the pace is picking up, with bankers behind Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’s record £12.1bn debt-and-equity agreed bid for Alliance Boots understood to be sounding out investors about providing covenant-lite support.The issue was led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.
459;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-25T18:35:57Z;Tax treatment of private equity? Don’t ask;;I sat opposite David Cameron at a dinner recently. “What do you think of the tax treatment of private equity?” I asked. It is the kind of icebreaker we fun-loving business journalists specialise in. “That’s such a good one I’ll answer it when I take questions from the floor later,” he replied, all teeth and floppy fringe.Not a chance.As Mr Cameron finished his speech and moved on to the Q&A, I bounced around in my seat, flailing a raised arm like a swotty schoolboy desperate for Sir’s attention. But he blanked me as he plucked questions from distant corners of the room. Then he was gone, leaving an insouciant smile hanging in the air like the Cheshire Cat’s.Wise chap. A party leader could get into a fearful scrape discussing the tax affairs of British companies owned by private equity investors. The hot potato is whether such businesses and their shareholders pay a lot less tax than their rivals. If they do, they have a competitive advantage that would ensure their continued growth in numbers. Eventually, capacity constraints would kick in – such as an inability of public markets to provide exits. Or every company would end up in the hands of Messrs Buffini, Moulton & Hands.Unabashed by Mr Cameron’s diffidence, I approached an expert at an accountancy body who is my usual snout for tax tip-offs – imagine Huggy Bear in a subdued suit. But he told me: “Our members don’t want to discuss this. They are making lots of money advising on private equity deals. They fear a change to the rules.” The CBI, usually willing to comment on anything from global warming to raindrops racing down a window pane, was also uncharacteristically coy.Undaunted, I persuaded a mid-sized accountancy firm to calculate the relative tax burdens of a conventional business and a company owned by private equity investors. After two days of number-crunching it cancelled the project. I suspect its chummy PR man is even now being redeployed to a vital position within its Port Stanley branch, serving the needs of the kelping community. His colleague told me: “This is a sensitive area and we do not want to be quoted. The unions and Jeremy Paxman have been getting involved.”Nervousness is understandable when you have Paxo on your tail. And he is not the only shark circling. A committee of MPs is investigating the pros and cons of private equity. The Treasury will examine the tax position, announcing its findings this autumn. The City is worried that when Gordon Brown becomes prime minister he will prove his Old Labour credentials by bashing the new plutocrats of private equity.To the conspiracy theorist, private equity can look very like a system for avoiding tax. Suppose that when Alliance Boots is taken private it stops paying dividends, which are deducted after tax, shelling out only interest, which is subtracted beforehand. At a headline level, that could wipe out corporation tax liabilities that stood at £24m in the six months to September 2006.If the UK’s mightiest purveyor of corn plasters and lippy then distributed extra shareholder value a few years hence, via sale proceeds when it changes hands again, private equity investors would pay tax at about 10 per cent.In contrast, if Alliance Boots stayed on the market and paid a special dividend instead, the distribution would attract tax at 32.5 per cent for many individuals and 28 per cent for corporate investors.Chris Higson of the London Business School fearlessly produced a simple computer model allowing me to compare different tax scenarios. This shows that a UK private equity investor can pay 75 per cent less tax on the returns of corporate success than an individual buying quoted shares and holding them for dividends.Although Professor Higson believes private equity is “costing the Revenue a lot of money”, he thinks that leverage rather than low tax is the reason for its growth. He says: “The real driver has been the ability to acquire the shares with a very small net investment, whose value is hugely multiplied on exit.”The equally forthcoming Philip Shuttleworth of the British Venture Capital Association points out that banks pay corporation tax on the interest they receive from buy-out loans, even if leveraged companies do not. That makes the tax treatment of debt and equity less lopsided than many critics have claimed. Even so, “there is a tendency for a private equity-owned company to have a lower tax burden”, says John Cullinane, intrepid president of the Chartered Institute of Taxation. He expects the government to impose a threshold on the amount of debt that is tax-deductible, set as a multiple of equity.A more drastic reform would be to abolish the taper relief that reduces tax on business disposals to 10 per cent after two years. Mr Cullinane discounts this possibility because Mr Brown introduced the tax break in the first place. You might ask: “Surely that U-turn would be worthwhile if it delivered a more neutral tax system that did not risk distorting company strategies?”But like Mr Cameron, I can sense when the water I am swimming in is deepening perilously. So I will get back to you on that one. And was there a less alarming question from the gentleman in the far corner of the room?jonathan.guthrie@ft.comPost and read comments at www.ft.com/guthrie
460;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-24T21:04:55Z;Boots LBO financing;;"The battle for Alliance Bootsis over. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts on Tuesday raised its cash bid for the UK health group to £11.39 a share, trumping last week’s offer by Terra Firma, Wellcome Trust and HBOS, which have now departed the field. The US private equity group and Stefano Pessina, Alliance Boots’ executive deputy chairman, now own more than a quarter of the company’s shares. This and the £12.1bn enterprise value KKR is prepared to pay proved the knockout blow in Europe’s biggest buy-out to date.The price, 24 times next year’s consensus earnings, is high. It seems reasonable to assume (from the £9.4bn loan facility available) that the deal will be financed at least 75 per cent by debt. Of the equity stub, Mr Pessina will own, perhaps, half. The remainder of the equity will be held, at least temporarily, by seven of the eight banks providing the financing for the deal.The use of such “bridge” equity, which is then sold on by the banks, may be more common in the US but is still very unusual in Europe. The advantages for KKR are obvious. For a start, it does not have to stump up a significant equity cheque itself. Mainly, though, it provides a competitive advantage during the bid battle; arranging the financing is easier and no other partners are required.For the banks, the advantages are less obvious. Selling on Alliance Boots equity should not prove a problem. Theoretically, though, the banks could be left with an illiquid and potentially volatile investment. The equity to be underwritten in this transaction – estimated at about £1.5bn – represents about £200m for each of the participating banks. This may seem a small price to pay to be involved. But the banks must regard it as a necessary evil rather than their preferred way to make money out of a deal."

463;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-24T18:53:07Z;KKR wins £11.1bn battle for Boots;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts on Tuesday night moved to calm fears of job cuts and store closures at Alliance Boots as the private equity chain won the takeover battle for the iconic high street chain and drug wholesaler with a revised £11.1bn bid.Dominic Murphy, partner at KKR, promised that the private equity firm would not close stores or lay off staff - and would even look to open more community pharmacies - despite having to put an additional £500m on the table after raising its offer to £11.39-a-share to see off a rival consortium. It also said it was not scaling back any investment plans.His commitment reflects the growing sensitivity of the private equity industry to attacks portraying it as job cutters and asset-strippers. KKR is also aware that this deal - the first leveraged buy-out of a FTSE-100 company - will face particular scrutiny given Boots’ profile as one of Britain’s oldest and most-trusted high street brands.“There is no requirement to pledge any time[frame]. The business has an important relationship with the British consumer and we want to nurture, invest and grow it and protect KKR’s reputation as well,” he said, adding that KKR would remain committed to Alliance Boots for “at least five years”.KKR, which teamed up with Stefano Pessina, the company’s executive deputy chairman and largest shareholder, clinched the deal after a frantic overnight raid which saw it scooping up 10 per cent of the company’s shares, thereby closing the door on a rival bid led by Terra Firma.The sale will be the biggest-ever public to private deal in Europe. One banker said on Tuesday night that this deal was an important test case for the industry’s reputation.“They have to behave as a long-term partner rather than doing a quick flip. With all the private equity money and the relative scarcity of deals to go for, they have to change their approach and be more about long-term value.”Mr Pessina said that he would invest over £1bn of his fortune – his 15 per cent stake is worth £1.67bn – back into Alliance Boots. It is not clear how much of the new company he will own. The company’s enterprise value is £12.2bnThe raised offer came on the heels of a frantic night of deal-making on KKR’s behalf by JP Morgan Cazenove and Merrill Lynch. By Tuesday morning, KKR and Mr Pessina had taken their shareholding to 26 per cent.The minority stake forced Terra Firma, Wellcome Trust and HBOS to drop its £11.15, or £11.26 with break fee, indicative bid.“Boots is a critically important national institution, and we are naturally disappointed not to be able to execute the bold vision we had for the company and its critical role in the provision of healthcare in the UK,” it said in a statement.KKR were advised By JP Morgan Cazenove, Merrill Lynch and UniCredit, Alliance Boots were advised by Goldman Sachs, Greenhill, Credit Suisse and UBS.
464;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-24T15:07:39Z;Secretive sector steps into the glare of publicity;;"After smashing records for deal-making in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific last year, the increasingly powerful private equity industry is in the spotlight as never before. But the price for buying large, well-known companies – in recent months FTSE100 retailers Alliance Boots have been under siege – is unprecedented public notoriety and private equity is struggling to cope with its new-found fame.Much of the attention has been negative, rattling the nerves of buy-out executives more accustomed to conducting business in private.Opponents argue that private equity groups are on a reckless, debt-fuelled acquisition spree, intent on their own enrichment at the expense of workers and the companies they buy.Proponents champion the private equity model and its power to transform under-performing businesses that grow sales, profits, and employee numbers faster than publicly-listed counterparts. The real profits from private equity’s successful deal-making, they argue, are large institutional investors, including the pension funds of teachers, nurses and government employees.But on one issue there is agreement. As owners of thousands of businesses in sectors ranging from media, transport, healthcare, retail and leisure, private equity can no longer operate in a vacuum.That is just as well – because 2007 looks set to be yet another milestone year.In February, the world’s largest leveraged buy-out – the $44bn acquisition of Texas utility TXU – was announced, a deal topping previous record breakers Equity Office Properties ($38bn) and HCA hospitals ($32bn). Those three deals, all struck within eight months, consigned to history Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’ infamous $30bn LBO of RJR Nabisco – for 17 years the world’s largest private equity deal.Armed with cheap debt, deal fever has also gripped Europe, including aborted talks last year by one large buy-out group to buy France’s Vivendi for about €40bn. Blackstone also hit the headlines by taking a strategic minority stake in Deutsche Telekom, a move attacked by some commentators that felt the large US buy-out group was acting more like a fund manager than a private equity house.Australia meanwhile has been Asia Pacific’s jewel, scooping five of the region’s top six private bids, led by the $11bn offer for airline Qantas. Although some large deals faltered, the pursuit of well-known businesses has forced private equity on to the front pages and served to underline the power buy-out firms wield in global markets.Mega deals have also put on notice the chiefs of the world’s largest companies who previously felt their size would give them immunity to private equity bidders. Two years ago, a private equity deal of much more than $10bn was considered outlandish; today some industry executives believe a $100bn deal will soon be possible.The engine for private equity’s growth has been the massive amounts of capital flowing into the many thousands of funds run by the private equity firms, underlining the quest by big investors to achieve returns that beat those offered in the public markets. For an insight into the “enigma of private equity returns”, turn to an article by Josh Lerner, the respected Harvard Business School academic, on Page 6.While the debate about the real returns made by private equity funds continues to play out, investors seem more than happy to prime the pump. Private equity groups that finalised their fund raising collected more than than $400bn alone last year, a figure forecast to rise to $500bn, according to figures from Private Equity Intelligence, a web-based information gatherer.Buy-out funds collect roughly half the total – with the 10 biggest funds raising about $110bn – with the rest of the capital flowing into venture capital, real estate, and infrastructure funds.The amount of capital available to private equity funds runs into thousands of billions once leverage is included. Yet if the shattering of deal records and fund raising has become almost commonplace in recent years, the industry was stunned in March when at long last one of its own broke cover to unveil plans to seek a stock market listing. The planned initial public offering of Steve Schwarzman and Pete Peterson’s Blackstone (see Pages 8 and 9), on some measures the world’s biggest private equity group, will, if successful, be copied by many of its rivals.But Blackstone’s planned IPO raised as many questions as answers – are we at the top of the credit and M&A cycles, what are the distinctions between public and private equity and are the legendary founders of the large buy-out groups cashing out just before the party ends. And few in the industry are celebrating private equity’s notoriety.In the UK, the world’s second largest private equity market after the US, buy-out groups have been thrust into a high-profile debate, and suffered attacks from unions, politicians and leading institutional investors. Not since a grandstanding German politician in 2005 described financial investors as “locusts” bent on asset-stripping and their own enrichment has private equity suffered such a concerted attack on its reputation.Meanwhile, the US Department of Justice is investigating possible collusion and anti-competitive behaviour among US buy-out houses, and South Korean prosecutors are investigating Lone Star, the US firm, and its investment in one of the country’s leading banks.Private equity has long faced suspicion of its sophisticated use of financial engineering but many in the industry are concerned that the level of attention is winding up a notch. In response, the industry is mobilising.US buy-out groups have set up the Private Equity Council, a trade and lobby group, to represent them in Washington, while large US and UK firms in Germany are working on a lobby group to overcome political resistance. In the UK, the Private Equity Foundation, a charity, has been established, partly in recognition that the industry executives are privileged and need to be giving back to the less well-off, both in money and time.Yet the political debate that has engulfed private equity has taken place during a benign period, when corporate default rates are low and in the absence of large private equity backed business collapsing.If and when the credit circle turns, it will be an altogether different environment. William Conway, the Carlyle founder regarded as one of global private equity’s smartest investors, recently highlighted the “very risky credit decisions” taken to finance buy-out deals. In a leaked memo, Mr Conway warned that: “The longer it lasts, the worse it will be when it ends.”"

That was clearly too tough a number for Terra Firma, Wellcome Trust and HBoS to beat – they have walked away.

467;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-23T21:43:14Z;Public find private equity a grey area;;"Private equity has seeped into many aspects of business life, owning assets from cinemas to toll roads, yet the industry is poorly understood by a majority of people living in Europe’s five biggest economies, according to an in-depth poll carried out on behalf of the Financial Times.The lack of understanding – 62 per cent of people are “not at all familiar” with private equity – comes at a time when the industry’s financial clout and appetite to buy large, well known businesses has never been greater.Martin Halusa, chief executive of Apax Partners, last week told delegates at a Citigroup conference in Miami that the industry was “woefully unprepared in terms of statistics and studies”.”We need to get our skates on to start arguing and telling our story,” he said. ”The issue of the public image of private equity is a real issue, it’s not going away and it’s spreading across Europe.”Damon Buffini, managing partner of Permira, Europe’s largest private equity group, recently told the FT that the industry had to reach out to the wider public, acknowledging there was a legitimate interest in the industry’s affairs.However, respondents in the FT/Harris poll who felt they had some familiarity with private equity appeared supportive of the industry.Nearly half of those familiar with private equity believe it had a “positive impact” on their country, with a further 35 per cent unsure whether it was positive or negative.Spain stood out, with 59 per cent believing that private equity was positive, compared with the UK at the other end of the scale at 40 per cent. Dozens of publicly quoted businesses are currently being pursued by private equity firms across Europe, including Alliance Boots, the FTSE 100 retailer; Iberia and Alitalia, the Spanish and Italian airlines; Altadis, the Spanish tobacco company; Adidas, the German sportswear group; and Valeo, the French car parts group.But many private equity executives believe the general lack of awareness of the private equity model is making it more difficult to buy companies.The poll found that 77 per cent of respondents familiar with private equity across the UK, France, Italy, Spain and Germany did not believe the industry was doing enough to address the concerns about it.The chiefs of large US and UK buy-out firms have in recent months stepped into the public limelight in an effort to damp the impact of a union-inspired campaign, particularly the actions of the UK’s GMB union, that has characterised the industry as asset strippers bent on sacking thousands of workers to cut costs and line their own pockets.On job creation, respondents who were familiar with private equity overall were nearly evenly split on whether the industry created more jobs (34 per cent) or destroyed jobs (32 per cent) with the balance not sure.However, after stripping out Spain, the four remaining countries destroyed more than it created.There was also an overwhelming feeling that private equity groups should be made more transparent about their performance and that of companies they own.Across the five countries, 83 per cent felt a need for greater transparency. Of the individual firms with strongest brand recognition, Blackstone scored best followed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, 3i and Apax."
468;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-23T17:45:29Z;Private equity cannot escape the public eye;;Can private equity be allowed to continue doing business in private? Surely not, in the light of the huge scale of the transactions now taking place. Alliance Boots, currently under siege from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Terra Firma, employs more than 100,000 and has 2,600 healthcare outlets across the UK’s high streets. If, as seems likely, this becomes the first FTSE 100 company to go private in an £11bn ($22bn) takeover – potentially Europe’s largest private equity deal to date – questions have to be asked about the public interest involved.With the volume of buy-out activity across the world running at $667bn last year, large chunks of the global corporate sector are becoming less transparent. In jurisdictions such as the US, where there is no requirement for private companies to make accounts publicly available, much information about business activity is disappearing into a black hole.In more open countries such as the UK, where unquoted companies have to file accounts at Companies House, going private means swapping the high disclosure standards imposed by the listing authorities for the less stringent requirements of the Companies Act. As a private company Alliance Boots, for example, would not be required to reveal its annual accounts until nine months after its year end. Nor would it have to publish interim figures or put its annual report on its website.Equity privateers thus stand accused of wielding power without responsibility. So what precisely is the public interest in private equity?Of the various stakeholders involved, employees stand to lose most from a change in ownership. While there is evidence that private equity is a net job creator in the long run, many deals involve heavy initial job losses. A recent survey by Britain’s Financial Services Authority found that increasing competition for deals in a climate of cheap credit has caused private equity fund managers to pay higher multiples for acquisitions while debt to equity ratios have risen. That points to potentially job-threatening financial vulnerability. Where pension funds are in deficit, this can also mean that the sponsoring company’s ability to keep the fund solvent is weakened.Against a background where the profit share in gross domestic product in the developed world is at its highest level for decades, private equity has spawned a backlash from unions and politicians, although more so in Europe than the US. This partly reflects the fact that private equity, with its investor-friendly emphasis, is fundamentally subversive of continental Europe’s stakeholder models of capitalism.Yet even in the UK private equity fund managers are feeling the heat. In an attempt to address the public interest issue, an industry group under Sir David Walker is working on a voluntary code to improve disclosure. It will probably call for more timely reporting that comes closer to quoted company standards for companies above a given threshold for employee numbers, although it seems unlikely that it will recommend inclusion of a directors’ remuneration report. But if private equity goes this way, why should ­conventional highly leveraged bids such as that by Ferrovial of Spain for BAA in the UK not be required to disclose too?Governments have much at stake in private equity. With its higher borrowing levels, there is a net initial reduction in the tax yield because interest is tax deductible. Some European governments, notably those of Germany and Denmark, have responded with proposals to reduce deductibility of interest as a quid pro quo for reduced headline rates of corporate taxation.Such action affects all corporate borrowers. A more specific potential threat to private equity lies in the tax treatment of carried interest – the 20 per cent share of the profit generated by the funds’ investments. As the registration statement for the initial public offering of Blackstone in the US points out, legislation to tax carried interest as ordinary income rather than as capital gains would be costly.Finally, financial regulators are interested in a host of issues, of which the biggest is systemic risk. The FSA study referred to earlier said that leverage was such that “the default of a large private equity backed company or a cluster of smaller private equity backed companies seems inevitable”. If that leads to systemic trouble, central banks know what to do. But in today’s complex financial markets it is difficult to identify who owns the economic risk in leveraged buy-outs. So be warned: bank bail-outs could be messy.
469;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Deal may presage fiercer private equity industry;;"If Stefano Pessina and KKR win the battle for Alliance Boots, the financing that is backing their deal looks likely to take Europe’s private equity industry further down the road towards the more aggressive American way of doing business.The bid vehicle of the Boots deputy chairman and his US ally announced on Friday the banks involved in the financing of the deal would take on some equity risk in the venture, which they can sell on to other investors.There have also been reports that the debt backing the deal would be in the form of loans with none of the covenants designed to protect lenders against a deterioration in the performance of the borrower; so-called “cov-lite” loans.None of the banks or parties involved would comment about this on Friday.Bankers say the equity syndication element is becoming increasingly common in European buy-out deals, although it is often done very quietly.“Equity syndication I think is probably going on more than we see,” says one London-based loan banker not involved in the Boots deal. “In deals where there is €500m-€600m of equity, some sponsors have said they want to hold as little as 10 per cent.”Private equity firms have long allowed investors to buy directly into a target company’s equity alongside the fund, but this forms part of their ongoing business relationship. Equity syndication, on the other hand, lets the banks involved sell on stakes to whoever will buy them.Barclays Capital, Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland and UniCredit are underwriting the equity. It is not known how large a portion of the equity will be sold.All of these banks as well as Merrill Lynch have signed up to underwrite and to syndicate the debt financing, which is being led by JPMorgan and UniCredit.JPMorgan was behind the only two “cov-lite” deals to be sold in the European debt markets so far, both of which emerged in the last few weeks."
470;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-20T21:51:03Z;Alliance Boots’ longevity data may be too old;;Alliance Boots could see its pension liabilities rise by anywhere from £186m to £645m if it used a more up-to-date table to calculate the life expectancy of its members, an analysis of its last annual report and accounts shows.The funding shortfall, in what has long been viewed as one of the UK’s most conservatively funded pension schemes, opens a window into the nature of likely discussions between the scheme’s trustees and the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts team that has tabled a £10.6bn bid for the group.The scheme had an accounting defict of £56.2m, and expected 2007 pension contributions of £102.5m.According to the Alliance Boots annual accounts dated March 31, 2006, the company estimates that its male employees who retire at 60 will live, on average, to 83.That estimate is already substantially short of the UK average.It is understood that a new valuation, commissioned by the Trustees as of April 1 – the last valuation dates from April 2004 – will use a more conservative set of longevity tables, known in the actuarial profession as PA92 medium cohort.Stephen Richards, an actuarial consultant specialising in longevity risk, said that a move of that order would increase liabilities by 5.3 per cent. Based on the £3.5bn in pension liabilities in the last report, that would result in a further shortfall of £186m.However, Mr Richards said that if the trustees were to use a mathematical approach – known as P-Spline – which takes trends from the past 40 years and projects them forward, it would increase the cost of providing a pension for each male member by 18.3 per cent.Mr Richards declined to comment on the Alliance Boots pension scheme.However, he noted that insurers and other companies which want to be conservative in reserving for longevity improvement are increasingly using a mathematical – P-Spline – approach to measurement.
471;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
472;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-20T21:51:03Z;Boots provides takeover acid test;;"Whether Alliance Boots falls to KKR or Terra Firma, any potential deal would become the acid test for private equity ownership of Britain’s largest and most iconic companies.The challenges are already apparent in the heady price of about £11 a share that
the bidders are willing to pay for the pharmacist and retailer. And the more the winner pays, the harder it will have to drive the company to make acceptable returns.That would not be a problem in a smaller deal. An advantage of private equity is the ability to take tough action that would be off limits for a public company, such as extensive lay-offs that can plunge it temporarily into the red.The snag for the would-be owners of Alliance Boots is the sheer size of this deal. It would be Europe’s biggest ever leveraged buy-out at close to £11bn.Private equity executives admit that in transactions this big, they cannot behave as though they are answerable only to themselves. In November, Charles Sherwood, a partner at Permira, the UK’s largest buy-out firm, said: “The argument that private equity is private may hold for smaller businesses. But when you own the UK’s …largest private company …people have different expectations on disclosure and that is understandable.”Since then, a public furore has broken out about private equity’s management methods following February’s private equity approach for J Sainsbury, the supermarket chain. The takeover failed amid resistance from members of the Sainsbury family, some
of whom had deep suspicions about private equity ownership.For its part, KKR is going into this situation with its eyes open. People familiar with the firm say it insisted on putting the name of Dominic Murphy, the partner leading the deal, on Friday’s statement. Others saw that as a risky disclosure. After all, Damon Buffini, the managing partner of Permira, has had to endure unions dragging a camel to his church in protest at his wealth.There are already fears that while Sir Nigel Rudd, the chairman, has teased out a great price for Alliance Boots’ shareholders, he has created a bigger problem for the current and retired work force. The worry is the new private equity owners will need to cut costs and use excessive debt funding to make the deal’s maths add up.Both KKR and Terra Firma are prepared to go on the front foot on this occasion, angry at what they see as unfair criticism. Their rationale for paying a huge premium to the share price is that Alliance Boots is a growth opportunity: pharmacies would be opened not closed; staff would be hired not fired.But trade unions have already waded in. Brendan Barber, TUC general
secretary, has told Sir
Nigel, KKR and Stefano Pessina, the executive deputy chairman backing its bid, that the prospect of the deal would alarm staff and customers.“Many such takeovers have hit staff and customers hard as the new owners seek to make the biggest and quickest possible buck at the expense of the long term,” he said.Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB, which has been at the forefront of the campaign against private equity, asked the government to ensure that pharmacies in outlying areas would not be closed to meet the cost of a highly leveraged buy-out.He also attacked the existence of tax relief on interest payments, which will assist in the funding of any highly leveraged transaction. Taxpayers would be subsidising any deal by £144m, he said. “The union considers [the tax break] is the motor that is driving this takeover of Boots and other household names.”It certainly does no harm to the economics of a bid but even with the tax break, City analysts are sceptical that private equity can make the numbers add up.Nick Bubb, analyst at Pali International, said in a note to clients that KKR would struggle to generate an internal rate of return of 20 per cent – the typical expectation of private equity investors – if it paid its proposed £10.90 a share for the company.This would require KKR to lift operating margins from 4.5 per cent to 7.25 per cent over the next five years, judged “very implausible given the pricing pressures in the business”.People familiar with each bid proposal say neither plan involves cost-cutting beyond that already envisaged by the current management. The required margin uplift would come from a dramatic increase in revenues achieved by renewed investment and service levels.Adopting such a strategy would not be possible if Alliance Boots stayed as a public company because its investors would baulk at increases in capital expenditure that could come at the expense of dividend growth.There is also a hope that liberalisation of pharmacy markets across Europe will transform the sector – and Alliance Boots could become a dominant international force.Restrictions on pharmacy ownership – long abandoned in the UK – are thought likely to be lifted in most European countries. And there is the hope that pharmacists will be given more power to prescribe medicines, drawing in patients and increasing footfall.The grand strategic dreams of Mr Pessina and fellow travellers are not sufficient for some of the sceptics.Mr Bubb believes that anyone paying about £11 a share would have to take “an axe to Boots’ HQ in Nottingham and the bigger stores.” Such a move would be likely to provoke a huge trade union backlash.On the other hand, if Terra Firma or KKR do expand the company, they could kill off the political storm forever."
473;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-20T21:20:04Z;Rivals for Boots take bid battle positions;;Two of the biggest names in the private equity world went head to head on Friday in the battle for Alliance Boots, igniting the stock market with rival bids that would make the health and beauty group the first FTSE 100 company to fall to private equity.Guy Hands, the British founder of Terra Firma, sought to spoil a recommended offer of £10.90 a share from Henry Kravis, his American counterpart at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, with a £11.15-a-share indicative offer that values the company at £10.9bn.Shares in Alliance Boots surged to £11.41 as the prospect of a bidding war increased. By going public at 7.34am with a £11.15 approach, the Terra Firma-led consortium – it includes the Wellcome Trust, Britain’s biggest charity, and HBOS – helped raise the market price and prevented KKR and Stefano Pessina from locking up the deal with a “dawn raid”, buying big slices of shares in the market.Mr Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance Boots, is its leading shareholder with 15 per cent and would require only an additional 10 per cent to have an effective blocking minority. Merrill Lynch, adviser to KKR, is believed to have managed to buy less than 2 per cent on Friday.Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Alliance Boots, is to allow the Terra Firma consortium more access to management and the company’s books to give it every chance to make a firm offer.However, the Alliance Boots board on Friday recommended a firm offer of £10.90 a share, or £10.6bn, from KKR and Mr Pessina after talks lasting most of Thursday night. The company stuck to its recommendation even in the face of Terra Firma’s higher offer but said it would offer the rival bidder “high-level due diligence including access to senior management”.Richard Baker, chief executive of Alliance Boots, is expected to meet Terra Firma in the next few days. The consortium is expected to decide whether to firm up its approach within two weeks.Whichever suitor wins, the probability of a successful bid increased the trade union anger against private equity firms, which are accused of asset-stripping. Brendan Barber, TUC general secretary, wrote in a joint letter to Sir Nigel and Mr Pessina: “The prospect of a takeover of Boots in the UK’s biggest ever private equity deal will alarm both staff and customers.”Additional reporting by Andrew Taylor and Neil Hume

Its price gained 1.8 per cent to 263¼p on very large turnover of 124m shares.The FTSE 100 closed up 46.2 points, or 0.7 per cent, at 6,486.8, lifted by a strong opening on Wall Street and a bid battle for Alliance Boots, whose shares gained 7.2 per cent to £11.25.The heavyweight banking sector provided extra impetus for the advance.Excited by rumours of a merger approach for France’s Société Générale, Barclays rose 1.6 per cent to 750p, while Standard Chartered climbed 3.9 per cent to £15.28.Standard shares were also lifted by rumours of a £20 a share bid approach from Citigroup.The FTSE 250 rose 101.6 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 11,900.6.Over the week, the blue chip index rose 24.4 points, while the mid-cap index lost 24.6 points.Intercontinental Hotels Group bucked the strong market trend, however. Shares in ICH, a rumoured takeover target, eased 2.5 per cent to £12.24 after a revenue warning on Thursday from Marriott International, a US rival.On a more speculative tack, Yell Group, the owner of the Yellow Pages, firmed up 0.3 per cent to 605p on speculation that it had asked Goldman Sachs to draw up a defence document against a possible private equity bid.The rumours were played down by sources close to the company.Vodafone added 2.8 per cent to 143.1p, excited by rumours, later denied, that it was poised to sell its 45 per cent stake in US mobile phone operator Verizon Wireless.BHP Billiton lagged behind its peers in the mining sector, gaining just 1.5 per cent to £11.51. Traders said it was held back by talk that it was preparing a bid for South Africa’s Eland Platinum. Among the mid-caps, Carphone Warehouse enjoyed further gains.Its shares rose 2.6 per cent to 303p after Merrill Lynch speculated that Carphone could announce at next week’s investor day that it had won the exclusive UK distribution rights for Apple’s iPhone.Separately, Cazenove suggest that Carphone could become a takeover target for its US joint venture partner Best Buy.“With $2.7bn of net cash on the balance sheet (and a market cap of $24bn) Best Buy clearly has the firepower to do so,” the broker said. “While we do not see CEO Charles Dunstone as a outright seller at this stage, being part of a much larger, global retail group could offer some interesting opportunities.”Engineering company Bodycote International sank 3.6 per cent to 307p as hopes of a fresh bid from Sulzer of Switzerland faded.Sulzer was Friday the subject of market raid in which Renova, an investment group controlled by Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire, swoop for a 32 per cent stake.Among the small caps, Inter Link Foods, the struggling cake maker, rose 5.7 per cent to 111p after McCambridge Group, an acquisitive Irish food company, declared a debut holding of 3.3 per cent. Traders believe McCambridge might use its stake as a platform from which to bid or to make an offer for one of Inter Link’s divisions.Sci Entertainment fell 4.6 per cent to 421½p unsettled by rumours that the company might have to lower earnings forecasts because of a delay with the launch of a new game.
475;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-20T18:34:00Z;Terra Firma’s Boots proposal lacks a solid footing;;Credit to Sir Nigel for fostering this auctionNo “pot of gold”: Stefano Pessina, architect of the Alliance Boots merger and the group’s strategy, has always said that there is no secret cache of value inside the company, to be revealed only after shareholders have handed him and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts full control.Have Terra Firma and its partners seen a glint of treasure that Mr Pessina and KKR missed?It seems unlikely, but it is difficult to see how, otherwise, they can justify their heady, if conditional, counter-proposal to KKR-Pessina’s firm bid of £10.90 a share. KKR and Mr Pessina are clearly prepared to accept a lower return than they projected when their suggested bid price of £10.40 persuaded the retail pharmacy and wholesale drug distribution group to open its books before Easter. Like KKR, the Terra Firma consortium has implied it is not looking for cost-cuts beyond Alliance Boots’ published programme of merger synergies. Yet it has suggested it could pay £11.26 a share, including the cost of redeeming the hefty break fee, and is prepared to wave goodbye to Mr Pessina, whom KKR sees as the linchpin of growth.There is little faulting Terra Firma’s tactics. By quickly raising its suggested bid price from a possible £10.85 to well over £11 on Friday morning, the private equity-led consortium prevented Merrill Lynch sweeping up extra shares in the market for its client KKR – a raid that could have made a counter-bid impossible.Sir Nigel Rudd, Alliance Boots’ chairman, deserves credit for having fashioned this auction from a fait accompli. But the conflicts inherent in the KKR approach could hamstring Alliance Boots if the bid battle is prolonged unduly. He now needs to make sure that the Terra Firma consortium does not dally over its due diligence and that it prevents any trade secrets it learns in the process from falling into the hands of competitors such as Celesio of Germany.If Terra Firma and its partners do firm up their offer, it should be simple for Sir Nigel to recommend investors to take the cash – if £10.40 was a generous price, why shun an extravagant one? – before moving on to his next PLC chairmanship. But, for all his red-blooded capitalist credentials, he would be bound to wonder, at such prices, about the viability of the buyers’ medium-term plan and its implications for Alliance Boots’ employees and customers. Such feelings would be noble and understandable, but they ought not to be his prime concern. It is up to Terra Firma’s financiers, not Sir Nigel, to decide whether the consortium’s alternative, Pessina-free strategy would lead to the supposedly mythical pot of gold – or to an all-too-tangible crock of something else.Finding a new AngloAs one of the first acts by a new chief executive of a multinational company, abolishing the chairman’s position at three divisions could be condemned as “mere” streamlining. For Cynthia Carroll, who took over as the first woman at the helm of Anglo American in March, it is a shrewd, though high-stakes decision.Ms Carroll mentioned the changes this week at the mining group’s annual meeting, where she promised she would “up the tempo, reduce bureaucracy and enable faster decision-making.” Three chairmanships – at the coal, base metals and industrial metals units – are among management layers being stripped away.This is more than a reshuffle, because, if the new structure is successful, it will help show sceptics that Ms Carroll, a former Alcan executive, is capable of running a group with a reputation for sprawl and conservatism. A simplification process is already under way – Anglo’s Mondi paper and packaging unit should be demerged in July, Ms Carroll said this week – but still, the new chief executive has a tough task.Anglo needs to shape up in part because it is being shown a clean pair of heels on efficiency by the likes of Xstrata, its younger, leaner and more aggressive rival. That Anglo is often mentioned as potential fodder for Xstrata’s acquisition machine is, as Ms Carroll is well aware, no coincidence.Not quite our typeWilbur Ross, the billionaire American investor, and Peter Hill-Wood, chairman of Arsenal football club, have probably never met. Perhaps they should. Canute-like, both men seem to think cross-border investment should be restricted, simply because they don’t like the cut of a particular investor’s jib.Mr Ross thinks the Alternative Investment Market is “clearly a danger” and will “attract the wrong kinds of people.” Mr Hill-Wood would resist a possible takeover of the venerable London club by an American entrepreneur because, he says, with uinimpeachable honesty, “we don’t want these type of people involved”.It’s time these titans of capitalism were introduced to the free market.

Not only did he secure a firm deal from Stefano Pessina and KKR at £10.90, a 35 per cent premium to the undisturbed share price; this morning he also received a proposal from Guy Hands’ Terra Firma, Wellcome Trust and HBoS at £11.26 (£11.15 if you deduct the break fee that would go to KKR, I think). That is a very respectable 40 per cent premium. But it doesn’t look like the end of the matter: Boots shares have shot through the latest offer to touch £11.36.Rudd has been in quite a difficult position, faced as he was with Pessina, his executive deputy chairman, strategic mastermind and largest shareholder, bidding for the company and saying he would leave if he failed. But Hands and his team don’t seem to care about Pessina. Incidentally, FT Alphaville says Merrill Lynch, acting for KKR and Pessina, attempted a dawn raid this morning but, not surprisingly, they got almost nowhere.Good news for RBS in its attempt to bid for ABN Amro. The Dutch finance ministry seems to have come down on the central bank governor, Nout Wellink, who this week warned against ABN Amro being taken over the RBS-led consortium. Finance minister Wouter Bos said the remarks were based on an “annoying misunderstanding”. ”Wellink has reassured me that he will be objective and unbiased,” Bos said during a visit to Berlin today, ANP-Reuters reported. ”He is mainly concerned about an orderly bidding process.”It seems hard to believe, but BP has had another safety emergency at Texas City: 90 workers were taken to hospital, complaining of eye irritation and nausea. We have since learnt that all workers have been released as the refinery is operating as normal. And in fact, the more we have looked into this today, the more it looks like a complete non-story. So don’t expect to see it in the paper tomorrow.WPP announced first-quarter revenues affected by the dollar’s decline against sterling.

478;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-20T15:06:22Z;Case study: Luck and canniness make one of the UK’s healthiest funds;;Like many a great British industrial conglomerate, ICI, the paints and chemicals giant, has slimmed down its operations considerably in recent decades. The company’s main UK retirement scheme now has only a handful of contributors out of a 75,000 membership. The scheme also owns assets worth about £7bn (€10.3bn), which is more than ICI’s market capitalisation. In early 2003, the scheme was more than five times the size of the company.In this state of maturity and scale, the scheme had already shifted largely out of equities and into bonds. This pioneering liability-driven investing was fortunately timed across 2000 and 2001. Before the equity market crash, the scheme had moved to about three-quarters fixed income – mainly a mixture of nominal and index-linked gilts. Around the same time it managed to take a significant position in AAA bonds, taking advantage of a significant pricing discrepancy between AAA-rated bonds and gilts.In spite of the canniness of its policies, both sponsor and trustee board realised that there was significant room to improve on its simple blend of nominal and index-linked gilts to match cashflows.Four years ago, the ICI scheme took another step in LDI by switching out of gilts and AAAs and buying, pound for pound, units in pooled funds run by Barclays Global Investors. These LDI funds now have upwards of £25bn in them but were novel when ICI became a client. The company’s outgoing group treasurer, David Blackwood, who worked with the pension scheme’s investment committee on the implementation, describes these funds simply as a synthetic inflation-linked fixed income portfolio.The choice of pooled funds came after a review of the use of standalone swap overlays, which would have been implemented directly by the scheme. “At the time, it was easier from an implementation and governance perspective to do what we wanted via these pooled funds,” says Mr Blackwood.There have been comments that banks are touting LDI solutions to make excessive profits out of swaps from pension schemes. Mr Blackwood doesn’t see it this way. “In LDI, the investment banks are pushing important risk management solutions,” he says.“Yes, they make money on swaps, and this is a function of spread and deal flow – but schemes and their advisers need to deliver best execution – and it is competitive.” Over the last four years, since the time of ICI’s first trade, the inflation swap market has grown significantly, and margins have tightened accordingly.Mr Blackwood is a highly experienced operational and corporate finance professional, and is very comfortable with these LDI investments.The assembled experience of the ICI scheme through its advisers and employees meant that BGI was required to present an audit trail of its swap executions on behalf of the scheme. There were no surprises. Mr Blackwood sees that, over and above the best execution requirement, the reputational risk to investment banks far outweighs any opportunities to short-change clients. In fact, he lavishes praise on the professionalism of Barclays and the BGI team.ICI and the scheme have looked at two other aspects of risk management that fit within the general LDI approach. One has been broadly fulfilled and the other has not been implemented to date.The realised project has been to diversify the main scheme’s growth portfolio out of equities into the likes of active currency management and emerging market debt. While over 80 per cent of the scheme’s assets are in a liability-driven portfolio, intended to cover about 60 per cent of liabilities, the rest of the assets are in a growth-seeking portfolio. It is good risk practice to diversify the growth portfolio and Mr Blackwood sees this diversification strategy for the “risky assets” as a theme for all schemes.The risk management piece that has not been implemented, which Mr Blackwood sees as of possibly greater value to the company than the trustees, goes back to the heart of the challenge of many LDI strategies – swap overlays executed directly by the scheme, or possibly even the company.He says that while around 60 per cent of the liabilities are covered by the liability driven portfolio, the remaining 40 per cent could be covered by swaps to stabilise these liabilities. It seems that a limited number of companies have actually used swap overlays directly between the bank and the scheme, but it is a growing trend. Mr Blackwood says “in some ways, it’s easy to look at current swap rates and assume that there is no rush to lock them in – particularly if execution seems difficult. However”, he continues, “ultimately that’s a bet like many others, and over time, you take them at your own risk, and within your own risk tolerance”.

It will still own most of the existing shares.The indicative price range of 210p-240p a share will give Xchanging a market capitalisation of £466m-£533m. Xchanging also said it planned to raise £75m by issuing new shares, which it will use to grow the business.Trading is expected to start on April 30.The listing of the business processing outsourcing business is the first of three high-profile IPOs in the sector that could garner more than $1bn between then in coming months, with General Atlantic set to be a big benefactor.Genpact, the New Dehli-based former subsidiary of General Electric, and Sutherland Global Services of the US are also preparing for IPOs in New York. The trio will join Indian-based outsourcers Firstsource, WNS and EXL, all of which have listed over the past year.Xchanging is the smallest of the three, with Genpact’s valuation expected to come in at more than £4bn (it will raise about $600m). Genpact’s main shareholders are General Atlantic, private equity house Oakhill Capital and General Electric. Sutherland is expected to raise about $250m, but will have a market capitalisation of more than $2bn.The market for business process outsourcing is booming. Capita, the only pure play BPO specialist currently listed in London has been growing strongly since it listed almost 20 years ago. Xchanging was founded eight years ago and helps run back-office operations for clients such as BAe Systems, Alliance Boots and Lloyd’s of London.Citigroup is sole sponsor of the Xchanging IPO, with Citigroup and UBS acting as bookrunners on the deal.

This is the vehicle of Maan Abdulwahed Al-Sanea, who, in the UK, owns a large stake in Berkeley Homes. He will now be HSBC’s second largest investor after Barclays. We had picked up rumours last week that Prince Al-Waleed had built up a 3 per cent but it was a different Saudi investor, it seems. HSBC shares are rising.Banks are providing us with lots of news today: the other big story is the fascinating battle for ABN Amro between Barclays and the RBS-led consortium. With the RBS interest confirmed late on Friday, ABN shares rose nearly 6 per cent this morning to €35.80. The economics for Barclays always looked flimsy and this only makes them more so. On the other hand, for all the deal-cred of RBS and Santander, there is a lot that is unclear and uncertain about their proposal. RBS shares, incidentally, are up more than 3½ per cent, which goes to show how far sentiment has changed since investors began moaning about Sir Fred Goodwin’s deal hunger.Peter Hargreaves and Stephen Lansdown are to float the Bristol-based stockbroker which bears their names, valuing their stakes at £260m each. This must be good news for Bristol City Football Club, which Lansdown chairs. The small investment banks are an interesting sector at the moment. Only last week we wrote about Richard Griffiths, co-founder of Evolution, returning to the market with a new firm, Ora Capital Partners, which is apparently likely to be valued at around £120m.

481;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-13T20:38:31Z;Pessina and KKR poised for Boots bid;;US buy-out group KKR and Stefano Pessina are poised to table a £10.1bn ($20bn, €14.8bn) formal offer for Alliance Boots as early as next week after racing through their due diligence in the light of growing interest from rivals.If successful, KKR, flanked by the executive deputy chairman of the company, will be the first private equity house to claim a FTSE 100 scalp. The deal would also be the largest European buy-out.CVC’s £11.4bn attempt to gain control of J Sainsbury collapsed last week after key members of the Sainsbury family resolutely refused even to consider an indicative offer at 582p-a-share.KKR and Mr Pessina, who is also Alliance Boots’s largest shareholder, have been conducting due diligence for just under two weeks. The board decided to open the books on the back of a £10.40 indicative offer, giving the company an enterprise value of £11.1bn.The consortium was expected to finished the due diligence next week, but decided to bring it forward in an effort to see off emerging rivals. Terra Firma, another private equity firm, and Wellcome Trust, Britain’s largest charity, have this week been scrambling to mount a rival bid.It is thought the consortium will begin to look at the Alliance Boots books next week, providing it signs confidentiality agreements over the weekend.Celesio, the German pharmaceuticals group that also owns the Lloyds pharmacy chain, is also looking at a possible bid for Alliance Boots. However, it has yet to secure private equity backing, which is unsurprising given the level of competition concerns surrounding such a deal.Alliance Boots and Celesio are either the biggest or second-biggest drugs wholesalers in each of the European markets.Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of the retail and drugs wholesale business, was hoping to get an auction going for the company to ease shareholders’ concerns that Mr Pessina could be taking advantage of his close knowledge of Alliance Boots to buy the business on the cheap.But an early formal offer could scupper that process, conceded a source on Friday night. “The board wants to get the right price but it can’t keep re-starting the clock every time a new bidder emerges. So Rudd would have to sound that out.”The shares closed 9p higher on Friday at £10.59 as markets waited for a potential auction. But KKR has a big advantage over rivals given Mr Pessina has already pledged his 15 per cent stake to the consortium.A deal would be Mr Pessina’s second big transaction in less than a year, having been behind the £8bn merger of Boots and Alliance Unichem last July.
482;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-12T00:40:06Z;Private equity newcomers;;Everyone loves cutting out the middle man. So what more tempting target than private equity managers with their massive fees?The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan has blazed a trail. Having built up its own private equity capability – and a strong record of returns on direct buy-outs – it is mulling a jump into the big league. The OTPP is sounding out Providence Equity Partners and Canadian institutions about a pursuit of Bell Canada’s parent BCE, which has a market capitalisation approaching C$30bn. Meanwhile, the Wellcome Trust, the UK’s largest charity, has teamed up with private equity firm Terra Firma to consider a bid for retailer Alliance Boots.Does this make sense? Yes and no. Seasoned investors in private equity funds such as the OTPP and Wellcome believe they can squeeze extra returns from direct involvement. This, of course, can be true. The route avoids the 2 per cent management fee and 20 per cent of profits third-party managers otherwise cream off.It must be particularly tempting for the biggest investors in alternative assets. They have money with a number of different private equity managers. Big deals, where managers club together, can magnify a pension fund’s exposure to a single buy-out, while still leaving it on the hook for multiple sets of fees. So judicious co-investments, alongside its preferred managers, allow a pension fund to hang on to more of the benefits.The equation changes somewhat if pension funds start taking really big, concentrated bets of their own on single transactions. The established private equity funds might be willing partners for such arrangements. They could get access to capital to do large deals, without having to dilute their control too much. For example, Wellcome would presumably take a back seat to more-experienced Terra Firma in the day-to-day oversight of Alliance Boots – in a way that, say, Blackstone would not. But charities or pension funds could find themselves painfully exposed if they leap into oversized positions in single companies at this stage of the cycle.If institutions are really serious, they should make a long-term commitment to building a private equity team in-house. On that score, the OTPP is ahead of others, and is doing a good job. It has built a strong investment track record through making direct investments in buy-outs of no more than a few billion dollars. That track record might give it the confidence to try something bigger.Others should, however, take note of the data showing quite how much the best private equity managers outperform their peers. Private Equity Intelligence, for example, has data for 900 buy-out funds around the world. Not only are the top performers pretty consistent. But even the worst funds in the top quartile have outperformed the median by an average of 11 percentage points annually over the past 14 years. The outperformance by private equity’s elite is even starker. It paints a very different picture from the much more tightly grouped performance of long-only equity managers.Doing-it-yourself is cheaper. But pension funds need to ask themselves if they can produce the same quality as they get (after fees) from the best private equity funds. And if they have the stomach, for example, to work through problems in portfolio companies themselves, if things turn sour. After all, frothy debt markets, low default rates and the economic stability that have fuelled the private equity boom will not last forever.For most large institutions, cutting their teeth on big buy-outs when private equity has already enjoyed a golden run seems over-aggressive. At least in the short term, they might do better using their scale to try to drive down the private equity industry’s extravagant fee structure – rather than trying to join the party when it is already at its height.
483;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-11T20:08:09Z;Failed bid highlights challenges;;The collapse of the CVC-led bid for J Sainsbury highlights the complicated challenges facing private equity groups looking to take large publicly traded UK companies private.Investment bankers and buy-out executives claim they face unprecedented resistance from the boards and shareholders of companies who have become suspicious private equity is buying companies too cheaply.As the markets become more familiar with private equity tactics, company boards are finding it easier to block these bids and to persuade existing shareholders to support alternative plans for generating value.The buy-out of Debenhams is a case in point. The publicly quoted department store group was bought by a buy-out consortium and refloated barely two years later. The buy-out team generated hundreds of millions of pounds in profits, leaving the previous investors feeling short-changed.Concern that this experience could be repeated has led boards to reject private equity bids, including ITV, Northgate Information Solutions, the payroll systems group, and Morgan Crucible, the ceramics maker.The presence of a strategic minority shareholder can work either for or against a private equity bidder. In the case of Alliance Boots, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has teamed up with Stefano Pessina, the deputy chairman who holds a 15 per cent stake in the company.By contrast, one of the reasons why the CVC-led team failed to win Sainsbury was the resistance of the Sainsbury family which holds 18 per cent of the stock.To help unlock long-term shareholders, buy-out groups often choose a scheme of arrangement. This is a court procedure under which a company convenes an extraordinary general meeting that votes the deal through, which allows for a shorter time scale than provided by the Take­over Code.But for a scheme to become effective, it requires the approval of 75 per cent of the value of the shares voted. This is useful for bidders who want maximum control over their acquisitions, because if a scheme is approved the bidder automatically ends up with 100 per cent of the company. Under a conventional bid, a bidder can only compulsorily acquire the holdings of minority shareholders if 90 per cent of investors have accepted the offer.In spite of CVC’s setback, its pursuit of UK-listed businesses is unlikely to fade. Armed with burgeoning acquisition funds, it is likely to employ fresh bidding tactics.
484;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-11T09:01:27Z;Boots suitor brings in Lehman;;The private equity consortium examining a rival bid for Alliance Boots has brought in Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, to advise it on a possible offer for the drug wholesaling and retailing group.Terra Firma, the private equity firm, and Wellcome Trust, the UK’s largest charity, confirmed on Tuesday they were “at the early stages” of considering a rival offer for Alliance Boots.If it makes an offer, the group would be taking on a rival consortium led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US private equity group, which has the support of Stefano Pessina, Alliance Boots’ deputy chairman and largest shareholder.The Terra Firma consortium is expected to examine Alliance Boots’s books in an attempt to see whether it can justify paying a higher price than KKR, which has offered £10.40 a share for the company, valuing it at more than £10bn.However, the consortium will have to work quickly to catch up with the KKR group, which is expected to complete its due diligence in the next few weeks.A rival offer would help ease concerns among Boots’ shareholders that Mr Pessina was taking advantage of his intimate knowledge of Alliance Boots to buy the business on the cheap.Wellcome Trust’s involvement in a private equity consortium has raised eyebrows in the City. Though the charity is a significant investor in private equity funds, it is unusual for such a group to directly involve itself in a bid.
485;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-10T18:59:34Z;Sainsbury hit as takeover looks set to unravel;;Mergers and acquisitions continued to hog the limelight as dealers returned from the four-day Easter break to a blitz of deal developments.J Sainsbury was the main focus amid growing signs that the private equity consortium bidding for the supermarket group had begun to unravel.With Texas Pacific Group and Blackstone Group having quit the consortium following the refusal of the founding family to sell at a price below 600p a share, hopes of a deal were slim.As expectations of a highly-leveraged bid faded, Sainsbury’s credit default swaps, which were trading at €146,000 last week, plunged €57,000 to €86,000, while shares in the grocer fell 4 per cent to 538½p. Wm Morrison lost 0.9 per cent to 315¾p and Kingfisher closed 0.6 per cent lower at 277p in sympathy.Scottish & Newcastle, down 1.9 per cent to 595p, fell despite speculation about a possible takeover of the brewer. One of the mooted bidders, SAB Miller – down 0.8 per cent to £11.15 ahead of a trading update tomorrow – has sought to distance itself from the takeover speculation, while Shore Capital analyst Andy Blain cast doubt on whether any of Carlsberg, Heineken or Diageo would be interested.Alliance Boots rose 0.6 per cent to £10.35 as Terra Firma, the private equity group, and Wellcome Trust, the charity, confirmed they were studying a bid for the chemist chain.Imperial Tobacco gained 0.6 per cent to £22.76 in spite of Altadis’s rejection of a revised €47-a-share takeover from the UK tobacco group. Some observers believe that the Spanish group may now turn the table on its suitor by bidding for Imperial in concert with BAT, which rose 0.2 per cent to £16.Royal Bank of Scotland rose 0.2 per cent to £20.08 as Merrill Lynch said a joint bid with Santander of Spain for ABN Amro made financial sense. Barclays, which is in merger talks with the Dutch bank, firmed 0.3 per cent to 735p.In the wider market, strength in the mining sector helped the blue-chip index close at its highest level for six weeks.The FTSE 100 rose 20.5 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 6,417.8, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 75.2 points, or 0.6 per cent, to a record high of 11,991.1.With metals prices sharply higher, Vedanta Resources was the day’s biggest blue-chip riser, up 3.6 per cent to £14.32.Of the other risers, Vodafone firmed 1.1 per cent to 138p as Bear Stearns upgraded the telecommunications group from “underperform” to “peer perform” and said the regulatory risk facing the company had receded.The real estate sector was boosted by consolidation hopes as France’s Unibail launched an all-share bid for Rodamco of the Netherlands. British Land rose 1.7 per cent to £15.82 and Slough Estates firmed 1.6 per cent to 801p, although gains were pared for Hammerson, up 0.3 per cent to £17.12. Unibail has been strongly linked with a Hammerson bid of late.Hanson advanced 0.6 per cent to 822p in spite of news that Cemex, the Mexican aggregates group, had raised its offer for Rinker of Australia.Although Cemex had been seen as possible buyer for Hanson, ABN Amro insisted that other bidders, such as Heidelberg Cement, Lafarge and private equity, could still be interested in the building materials group.Marks & Spencer rose 0.6 per cent to 695p as JPMorgan advised clients to switch into the clothing retailer from rival Next, up 0.2 per cent to £23.17. While M&S has underperformed the wider market by 6 per cent since its January trading update, Next has outperformed by 22 per cent.In the mid-caps, the ever-volatile PartyGaming was the biggest gainer, up 6.2 per cent to 56p, while Ashtead, the plant hire group, put on 6 per cent to 164p in response to a sharp rise in the share price of United Rentals. The US group, Ashtead’s nearest peer, rose 17 per cent yesterday after it put itself up for sale.Carphone Warehouse lost 2.8 per cent to 427¾p as it gave back most of last week’s rally. The stock was unsettled by reports that the mobile communications retailer was the only bidder left in the auction for Pipex Communications, although analysts said that BT Group should not be discounted.William Hill closed flat at 643½p as David Harding, William Hill’s chief executive, made about £2.5m by selling 385,000 shares in the company under an executive director incentive plan, at 648½p each.
486;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-10T13:11:42Z;Wellcome Trust and Boots;;Rarely welcome and hardly trusted, the private equity industry seems an odd bedfellow for the UK’s largest charity. Yet, over Easter, it emerged that a consortium comprising the Wellcome Trust and Terra Firma was considering a rival bid for Alliance Boots, the UK pharmacy group currently the subject of a £10.1bn offer led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.Charities have been increasing allocations to private equity over the last few years, usually via third-party managers. Often, due to the cosy nature of the charity sector, trustees are prone to chasing investment fads. Following property and hedge funds, private equity is the latest must-have asset class. To be fair, Wellcome is one of the more sophisticated investors and already has £1.6bn of private equity exposure – 12 per cent of its portfolio. It also has undrawn private equity commitments of £1.5bn.For charities with long-term horizons, private equity investments can make sense. Over the last 10 years, Wellcome’s private equity returns have, unadjusted for risk, outperformed its public security holdings by 7.3 per cent annualised. But with many funds chasing few targets, valuation and risk levels are rising, suggesting future returns will be more subdued. Wellcome’s size does at least garner it access to the best managers. That is important: in private equity, the difference in performance between the top and median managers is far wider than for listed equities funds.Wellcome has not outlined its plan, but direct ownership of Boots should be viewed with suspicion. Wellcome may be conflicted as it presumably owns shares in its equity portfolios. It may be able to avoid paying Terra Firma management fees if it commits enough capital, but this would mean a large exposure to a single, risky investment. Charities must avoid the allure of direct investing. Rather, they should pay experts to deliver superior returns while being ruthless with those that don’t.
487;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-10T11:12:14Z;Sainsbury bid in trouble;;This week should be an important one for several of the big bid situations around at the moment but none more so than J Sainsbury.Today, TPG and Blackstone seem to have followed KKR out of the consortium bidding for the supermarket group, leaving CVC on its own. No wonder the shares are down more than 20p, or nearly 4 per cent, at 540½p by midday. The consortium’s improved proposal yesterday of 582p received a cool reception from the family. FT Alphaville says CVC is prepared to proceed on its own but the prospects of a firm bid by Friday’s deadline don’t look at all good.Also by the end of this week, KKR and Stefano Pessina should have completed their due diligence on Alliance Boots and be in a position to make a firm offer. And we’ll see how Imperial Tobacco responds to having its improved proposal of €47 a share (up from €45) rejected by Altadis (whose shares are off a bit this morning). The Franco-Spanish group, you can be sure, is doing all it possibly can to flush out a rival bid, perhaps from BAT and/or private equity bidders.Don’t expect Barclays to bid for ABN Amro this week. Next week looks more likely. And then it’ll be interesting to see if the mooted rival bidder RBS is just making mischief or is serious. Analysts at Merrill Lynch, whose colleagues in investment banking are advisers to RBS, published a note today on the prospects of a joint ABN bid from RBS and their old friends Santander. Such a move, which we think might be more technically tricky than it looks, would be 5 per cent accretive to RBS earnings by 2009 with a return on investment of around 11.5 per cent, Merrill says. FT Alphaville has also got some Merrill research running through an “additional funding option” for Barclays on the deal.Interesting to see that British Energy today said it had begun proceedings against Credit Suisse over the exercise of the lending banks’ options to acquire the Eggborough power station in Yorkshire in 2010. The dispute dates back five years to when the company was on the verge of collapse and this coal-fired power station didn’t seem very core. Now, with nuclear plants out of action and the price of gas sky-high, British Energy feels differently about things.The dog of the day, or should I say car crash of the day, is Accident Exchange, which provides replacement vehicles. Its shares halved this morning after issuing a profit warning in which, rather worryingly, it said it was “undertaking a review of the appropriateness of its current financing structure” and might consider an equity fundraising.Make or read a commentAbout this blogSee previous blogs
488;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-09T23:02:51Z;Sainsbury risks taking on a family discount;;Minority shareholders have so far succeeded, indirectly, in depriving investors in J Sainsbury of a 582p-a-share takeover bid that the board apparently thinks is at a recommendable price. Who is to blame for this bizarre situation?The board looks vulnerable to criticism. If it believes the latest proposal from CVC and its private equity partners is fairly priced, the natural course of action would be to open the books up to the consortium. Shareholders could then vote on whatever hard bid subsequently emerges. But the board looks set not to open the books, thereby halting the process and robbing shareholders of that option.In reality, it is unclear whether the option really exists. Minority shareholders, dominated by Sainsbury family members, are resistant to an offer at 582p. So any shareholder vote would probably fail to win the 75 per cent of acceptances required for the consortium to secure its necessary tax-efficient financing. In which case, why bother opening the books?It is a shame that the board, led by Sir Philip Hampton, seems to feel that it lacks the power to convince all shareholders of the merits of the indicative offer. The risk now is that there is no bid and the shares drift. And when investors digest the power that the Sainsbury family and others have in influencing the company, the shares may attract precisely the wrong kind of family discount. chris.hughes@ft.comCode for boutiqueWhen the bull market is roaring and the bulge-bracket investment banks are in demand for their balance sheets, it can be tough for smaller advisory firms to muscle in on the high-profile deals.Small wonder that some investment banking boutiques are championing the value of their independence and are using Rule 3.1 of the Takeover Code to reinforce their arguments. This beneficial rule requires a company that is subject to a bid approach to obtain competent, independent advice on any offer for the sake of the company’s shareholders. It is often evoked during private equity bids.This is how Greenhill, the boutique advisory firm, won a role on Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’ takeover of Alliance Boots. The logic goes like this. Goldman Sachs is acting for Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Boots. But because it has advised and financed several deals for KKR in the past, it is not considered sufficiently independent by the Takeover Panel. The appointment of a boutique – which is conflict-free because it provides only advice on deals and not debt and equity financing – should keep everyone straight when it comes to valuing the company being acquired.Given the increasingly incestuous relationship between investment banks and buy-out firms, it is surprising that so few independent boutiques demand roles on private equity deals. In the first three months of 2007, the volume of UK buy-outs more than quadrupled to $17.1bn (£8.7bn), according to Dealogic. Why, then, are there not more independents lobbying the Panel for roles on the continuing stream of deals?One reason could be fees. The independent advisers are not paid by the board of the target company, but by the bulge-bracket adviser they are working alongside, so the rewards are small. And while boutiques do get league table credit – an important marketing tool for winning new mandates – their ranking is almost always dwarfed by the larger banks who require only a couple of blockbuster deals to top the tables.With little sign of private equity activity slowing down, perhaps the Takeover Panel should step up its scrutiny of independent advisers and demand their presence on more deals. lina.saigol@ft.comStub equityThe inclusion of stub equity in the consortium bid for J Sainsbury could not win over the board so long as there was no accompanying increase in the value of the offer. Yet stub equity has helped persuade investors to accept a bid for Countrywide.The differing responses to stub equity underscore its attractions and drawbacks. Stub equity is a share-based component in mainly cash bids by private equity firms for public companies. It gives existing investors some economic exposure to the company after its sale.As a financial asset, stub equity is not that attractive. It tends to be either unlisted or traded in an illiquid market on Aim. It often carries no voting rights. Either way, the private equity firm is in the driving seat as the dominant shareholder.The drawbacks may matter less to hedge funds – such as those attracted to the Countrywide stub – than institutional investors, as hedge funds have more flexible investment parameters. But in most situations, stub equity is a tough sell. Shareholders will either seek a prohibitively generous slug of it, or a decently priced cash alternative. Rightly so. Investors ought to demand full value in a bid – regardless of the currency in which it is denominated. chris.hughes@ft.com
489;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-08T19:47:45Z;Terra Firma enters Boots arena;;Terra Firma, the private equity group considering a rival bid for Alliance Boots, will not be able to enlist the support of the company’s deputy chairman and largest shareholder, Stefano Pessina, should it press ahead with its plan to team up with Wellcome Trust, the UK’s largest charity.Mr Pessina has already committed to support a bid for the company by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which has offered £10.40 per share. Mr Pessina has a 15 per cent stake in Alliance Boots.The Wellcome Trust, which funds scientific research in the UK, and is a staunch supporter of the private equity industry, has joined forces with Guy Hands’ private equity vehicle, Terra Firma, to request access to Alliance Boots’ books.The consortium could trump the KKR offer that was made last month.Mr Pessina is understood to have ruled out working with any other prospective bidder, even one offering to trump the KKR bid. It is understood he would prefer to sell his stake in the open market rather than work alongside any other bidder for the company.However, any other buyer would have to move very swiftly if they were to have any chance of tabling a competing bid.KKR and Mr Pessina already have a significant headstart as they have begun the due diligence process. This is only expected to take two to three weeks, which could lead to a formal recommendation to accept an offer from the current bidders as early as the end of this month.Mr Hands and the Wellcome Trust are believed to have approached Sir Nigel Rudd, Alliance Boots’ chairman late last week seeking permission to examine the company’s books. They are expected to be granted approval this week.Their bid plans are understood to be at a very preliminary stage. They do not yet have financing in place and have not yet appointed a financial adviser. Many of the top investment banks are already advising one of the parties involved in the deal, although it is understood that the rival bidders are now in talks with several banks.Alliance Boots, which was formed only last year with the merger of Boots and Alliance UniChem, agreed to open its books to KKR’s camp at the end of last month after the bidders increased their original £10 per share offer by 40p per share.The current bid values the group at about £10.1bn. It is expected that Terra Firma would have to top the KKR offer by at least 30p per share to encourage Mr Pessina to sell.The Wellcome Trust was founded in 1936. It has a £6bn ”alternative” investments portfolio that includes private equity and hedge funds.
490;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-08T19:12:34Z;Changing the Wellcome way;;Wellcome Trust’s potential role in a private equity bid for Alliance Boots was greeted with surprise by observers, as such a move would mark a break with the traditional approach of charity fund managers.Terra Firma, the buy-out firm, is understood to be keen to join Wellcome to launch a rival bid for the healthcare group that is currently in talks with its deputy chairman and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US private equity house.Such a link-up would bring together a long-term charitable investor with one of the most innovative buy-out firms. That said, any move on Alliance Boots would tally with recent signs of a more aggressive approach to fund management by Danny Truell, Wellcome’s chief investment officer.The former Goldman Sachs partner has earmarked a part of the UK’s largest charity’s portfolio for hedge fund, private equity and other non-quoted investments. He has made it clear that he aims to maximise investment returns, which, in turn, help fund Wellcome’s charitable activities.Mr Truell has been a vocal supporter of private equity in the face of heavy criticism from trade unions. Earlier this year he wrote to the FT saying changes to the taxation of private equity and hedge funds could have ”disadvantageous consequences”.Last July he masterminded the launch of a £500m bond, one of the first by a UK charity, to leverage additional funds for investment.The Wellcome Trust was founded in 1936, following instructions left in the will of Sir Henry Wellcome, to invest in original science. The group has financed a number of long-term research initiatives, including drugs to combat Aids and funding the public project to map the human genome.In 1995, Wellcome merged with Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals group. Six years later it cut its direct investment in Glaxo in an attempt to broaden its portfolio away from one pharmaceutical heavyweight into a more balanced spread of equities and other investments.It is as yet unclear exactly what the role of the trust would be in any bid for Alliance Boots. Terra Firma and the trust would be playing catch-up with the current bidders.
491;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-05T17:07:46Z;Lord Sainsbury to reject CVC offer price;;Lord David Sainsbury is understood to oppose the supermarket group opening its books at the price being offered by a CVC-led private equity consortium for the supermarket group.The bid for J Sainsbury, which was tabled on Thursday afternoon and is believed to offer an indicative price of 550p to 570p per share, could face problems as the Sainsbury family, who together control about 18 per cent of the company, are thought to support Lord Sainsbury’s opposition to opening the books for less than 600p per share.The consortium, now consisting of CVC, Blackstone and Texas Pacific Group, tabled the offer just hours after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts pulled out of its bid due to concerns about the price, competition issues, the pension fund trustees and the Sainsbury family’s reservations about the bid.But sources close to Lord David Sainsbury, who has a 7.75 per cent shareholding, say that he has told the board that he does not see why the company would open the books for less than 600p a share.It is thought that the family, which between them owns an estimated 18 per cent of the business, would act as a bloc on the issue. Their reticence could prove a headache for chairman Philip Hampton, if his other shareholders are willing to open the books at the indicative price.KKR walked away from Sainsbury’s partly due to concerns that the bid price was too high. An offer of 570p would be beyond its comfort zone.KKR is also thought to have left because of concerns over possible competition issues. The US-based private equity firm is currently bidding for Alliance Boots, having put forward a £10.40-a-share offer for the drugs wholesaler and retailing group.KKR was worried that doing both deals could throw up competition issues, given that Sainsbury’s and Alliance Boots between them have a 34 per cent share of the health and beauty market. Both deals could get referred to the competition regulators – a process that can take months to resolve.The consortium first announced its interest in the supermarket chain at the beginning of February.The tabling of an offer has, however, been held up by Sainsbury’s pension trustees, who have been wrangling with the consortium over how to deal with the pension deficit.Talks have been running for more than three weeks but the two sides have yet to reach an agreement. It is thought that the trustees want a substantial up-front payment from the consortium to help offset the company’s higher risk profile.They are also understood to be considering asking to be placed ahead of creditors in the event of insolvency.The consortium could put in an offer without first agreeing terms with the pension trustees and sort out the pension issues at a later stage.However, that is a high-risk strategy. Pension fund issues often become the stumbling bloc in a deal, as Sir Philip Green’s failed attempt to takeover Marks and Spencer in 2004 clearly proved.
492;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-05T14:25:01Z;KKR walks away from Sainsbury’s;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has pulled out of the CVC-led consortium that is frantically trying to table an £11bn-plus offer for J Sainsbury, Britain’s third-largest supermarket chain.The group is thought to have walked away from Sainsbury’s due to concerns over possible competition issues and the being considered by the consortium. The US-based private equity firm is currently bidding for Alliance Boots, having put forward a £10.40-a-share offer for the drugs wholesaler and retailing group.One source suggested that the consortium – now consisting of CVC, Blackstone and Texas Pacific Group – could put forward an indicative offer of 570p, which would be beyond KKR’s comfort zone.KKR was worried that doing both deals could throw up competition issues, given that Sainsbury’s and Alliance Boots between them have a 34 per cent share of the health and beauty market. Both deals could get referred to the competition regulators – a process that can take months to resolve.The departure of KKR has not ruffled CVC, which could tender an offer later on Thursday, thought to be in the range of 550p.While the three remaining members can still finance a bid, the withdrawal of KKR piles on more pressure on the consortium, still grappling with pension issues in the face of a looming Takeover Panel “put-up or shut-up” deadline.The consortium has just 10 days to go before the April 13 deadline and has yet to have a good look at the retailer’s books.Philip Hampton, chairman of the supermarket chain, is reluctant to extend the time frame, given that the private equity houses have had nearly six weeks to make their move following the panel’s ruling. The consortium first announced its interest in the supermarket chain at the beginning of February.Trying to table an offer has, however, been held up by Sainsbury’s pension trustees, who have been wrangling with the consortium over how to deal with the pension deficit.Talks have been running for more than three weeks but the two sides have yet to reach an agreement.

493;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-04T19:51:09Z;The duty of judgment rests with the shareholder;;Investors should not expect FSA nannyingThe Financial Services Authority’s reform of hedge fund and private equity listings has been clumsy at best. But one good thing has come out of it: a proper review of the quality of companies now listing on the London Stock Exchange.To recap, the UK has a two-tier regime that allows investment funds domiciled overseas to list in London by complying with minimum standards of governance and disclosure. UK funds have to satisfy tougher “primary” rules that some see as a deterrent to listing in London.After much vacillation, the regulator is planning a new unified listing regime for all funds. In terms of rigour, this will be somewhere between the minimum and primary regimes. If this is liberal enough to attract hedge and private equity funds to list in London rather than, say, Amsterdam, yet sufficiently tough to satisfy the existing investment trust community, then hats off to the FSA.The alternative to this compromise would have been to retain a two-tier market giving all investment funds – and their potential investors – a choice of regimes.But the FSA appears to be rethinking the benefits of London’s tiered stock market. It is also launching a consultation into the quality of companies now coming to the London market, not just investment funds, many of which choose not to take a primary listing. This follows concern about the many emerging-market companies coming to London by floating lightly regulated global depository receipts.The debate is welcome. A possible outcome may be better labelling of the various forms of London listing available. But professional investors should remember that they have a duty to understand what they are buying. And they should exercise their own judgement rather than have the FSA steer their investment decisions via the listing rules.Chemical reactionThe bid speculation surrounding ICI proves that it is getting harder to acquire UK companies on the cheap.Investors have pushed the chemical group’s shares up 30 per cent since takeover rumours surfaced in November, when ICI sold its Quest flavours and fragrances business. The deal left the rump of ICI looking like a bite-sized target, in particular for Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands.Assuming that ICI’s pre-November share price counts as its undisturbed market value, then the stock is now almost fully pricing in a conventional bid premium. But any takeover offer would have to be pitched well above its present 538p share price. The likelihood of lengthy competition hearings means a bidder would have to factor in the time value of money for perhaps up to a year. That suggests a minimum offer price of about 600p a share. The buyer would also have to take into account ICI’s £1bn pension deficit, although that is offset by its £500m of net cash.An offer in this territory would be well above where most analysts see as ICI’s fair value. So a buyer would need to identify substantial synergies to justify such a move. But ICI is much leaner than it used to be and there may not be excess cost left to take out. And Akzo would also have to sell off either ICI’s Dulux or its own Crown paints businesses in the UK to satisfy regulators.Cazenove points out that even a bid at 650p a share would be consistent with the valuation put on BOC, the UK chemicals group bought by Germany’s Linde last year. True, but the continuing strength of ICI’s share price risks becoming an obstacle to a deal. Other UK companies should draw some comfort from this. Investors are sending a clear signal that they expect predators to pay up.Drug suppliesAlliance Boots’ recent agreement to be the sole distributor of drugs made by Pfizer, the US pharmaceuticals groups, was so radical that it was always likely to face regulatory scrutiny.Now the Office of Fair Trading is reviewing the UK’s wider drug distribution market.Instead of selling drugs to a variety of wholesalers, Pfizer now retains ownership of the drugs until they are bought by the pharmacy. It simply uses UniChem’s distribution infrastructure (part of Boots), paying the company a flat fee. There is no obvious reduction in competition from the new model that harms patients or taxpayers, since the drug prices paid by the National Health Service are not affected. But UniChem has gained market share and rival wholesalers could be squeezed. They may no longer be able to afford to stock a complete line of drugs. If some folded, that could disrupt supplies.The probe probably has the most serious implications for Pfizer, given its strengthened grip over the supply chain. Either way, the result will come long after KKR, the US private equity group, completes its proposed buy-out of Alliance Boots. And for the time being, KKR is likely to view the OFT’s interest as testimony to the strength of the medicine distribution business it looks set to acquire.
494;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-04T19:04:21Z;SSL hits high on talk of Reckitt approach;;Another day, another bid rumour. This time the name in the frame was SSL International.In heavy volume, shares in the school footwear and Durex condom maker climbed 6.6 per cent to a five-year high of 426p. The reason was rumours of an imminent 465p-a-share bid approach from Reckitt Benckiser, up 0.3 per cent at £26.70.Traders said SSL would be a good bolt-on acquisition for the over-the-counter healthcare business Reckitt acquired from Alliance Boots, off 0.2 per cent at £10.24, last year.By pushing SSL brands through its distribution network, Reckitt would be able to make large cost savings. Annual sales at SSL are expected to be about £500m this year and fixed overheads to maintain its global distribution system is about £130m.However, analysts were sceptical anyone would bid before SSL’s trading statement on April 13.There was also a speculative buzz around InterContinental Hotels Group. A late flurry of buying saw its shares close 0.8 per cent higher at £12.78. The talk in the market was of a break-up bid involving the Barclay brothers, 7 per cent shareholders, and a private equity group.In the wider market, leading shares closed flat as investors refused to chase the market ahead of the long holiday weekend and Thursdaday’s US jobs data.Wall Street will get a chance to react to those figures on Monday, when the UK market will be shut. As such, many traders said they were trimming long positions.The FTSE 100 closed 1.4 points lower at 6,364.7, while the FTSE 250 improved 3.7 points to 11,889.2Life assurer Prudential was one of the day’s best performers. Its shares moved up 1.7 per cent to 744½p amid talk of predatory interest from HSBC, 0.2 per cent stronger at 892p.The story was that HSBC had told investors at a meeting that it wanted to expand its insurance business so that it had a material impact on group profits.In the same sector, Resolution gained 1.4 per cent to 634p, helped by a positive note from Morgan Stanley.The broker said Wednesday’s annual results were generally positive and the disclosure of £1.5bn of excess capital was a real plus for shareholders.“While it seems management’s preference is still to complete further transactions, in our view a plan ‘B’ of returning capital to shareholders is an attractive fall-back position,” it said.Elsewhere, Home Retail Group, the parent company of Argos and Homebase, was another strong performer. Its shares rose 2.5 per cent to 460¼p, responding to a Citigroup upgrade to “buy”.Setting a 500p target price, the broker said HRG was a credible takeover target for the private equity industry and noted that the company was the subject of a provisional buy-out approach before its demerger from GUS last year.On the downside, Cadbury Schweppes lost 1.6 per cent to 660½p after Deutsche Bank said a bid for the company’s confectionery business was less likely than the market expects.Scottish & Southern Energy marked time at £15.82 per cent after Citigroup said management would not sell out for anything less than £20 a share, a price few would be willing to pay.Away from the blue-chips, Carphone Warehouse gained 4.7 per cent to 292¾p excited by rumours that Charles Dunstone, co-founder, chief executive and 33 per cent shareholder, was considering taking the company private.However, the rumour was quickly rubbished and traders said the rise probably had more to do with short sellers buying back their positions.It was a similar story at HMV. Its shares climbed 5.8 per cent to 113¾p as short sellers closed positions in the wake of Wednesday’s director share buying. Led by chief executive Simon Fox, HMV directors purchased a total of 75,000 shares.HMV is the most “shorted” company in the FTSE 250, with around a quarter of its issued share capital on loan.Taylor Woodrow, the housebuilder in merger talks with George Wimpey, gained 1.8 per cent to 502p after Merrill Lynch upgraded its shares to “buy” with a 550p target price.“Clearly we have missed some of the 20 per cent of the outperformance since the merger was announced. However, we believe that there is a strong probability that Persimmon will counter bid at an initial price of 525p–550p,” the broker said.
495;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-04T10:48:15Z;OFT to launch drugs distribution probe;;The Office of Fair Trading said on Wednesday it would investigate distribution of medicines in the UK after Pfizer began selling its prescription drugs through a single distributor, Unichem, part of Alliance Boots.The probe will be completed by the end of the year and could result in a range of outcomes, ranging from giving the market a clean bill of health to enforcement action against companies deemed to be breaking competition or consumer law.In a brief response to the announcement, Alliance Boots said the investigation “does not effect the operation of the group’s direct to pharmacy distribution arrangements with Pfizer”.Alliance Boots is currently facing a £10bn bid from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and its own deputy chairman Stefano Pessina. Celesio, the German owner of the rival Lloyds pharmacy chain, is also exploring a possible offer.Until recently all prescription drugs were distributed through competing wholesalers, but Pfizer’s move last year to a single distributor arrangement prompted hundreds of complaints to the OFT from other wholesalers as well as from pharmacists and doctors.Other drug manufacturers, including AstraZeneca Plc, are also considering introducing changes to their own distribution arrangements following Pfizer’s move.The OFT is tasked to ensure the operation of the market allows timely, efficient and cost effective distribution of medecines to patients. The National Health Service currently spends over £10bn a year on drugs provided through 800m prescriptions a year.
496;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-03T19:08:18Z;The Short View: Barbarians moving on to large-caps;;How many gates can the barbarians break down? Private equity funds and activist investors have been known as barbarians ever since Barbarians at the Gate, the novelistic account of the epic buy-out of RJR Nabisco in 1988.Rather than staying outside the gates, they have now conquered small and medium- sized stocks and are moving on to large-caps. Stocks under pressure from activists include Alliance Boots in the UK, Carrefour of France, and DaimlerChrysler of Germany. Numerous large companies are going private in the US. Only the giant “mega-cap” companies can repulse the barbarians. This is bad news for their shareholders, as this has shown up in poor price performance.The effect is dramatic. The Russell Global Small Cap Index gained 5.1 per cent in the first quarter (6.9 per cent outside the US), while the equivalent large-cap index rose only 2.6 per cent. But the Russell Top 50, covering the largest US companies, is actually down 1.8 per cent for the year.Mega-caps have shown up on value investors’ screens for a while and with reason. The Russell Top 50 trades on a price/earnings multiple of 15, while the Russell 2000 index of small US companies is at a multiple of 40. But mega-cap share prices continue to lag. Jonathan Stubbs of Citigroup looks at the performance of the 10 largest stocks in the world’s biggest indices. In the FTSE 100, and Europe’s DJ-Stoxx 200, these stocks have underperformed their indices by about 10 per cent over the past six months. In the S&P 500 and the Nikkei 225, they have underperformed by 6 per cent.There are other reasons for this. Conglomerates are out of favour and large companies tend to be proxies for global growth, which is unconvincing. But in a market being driven by liquidity, the biggest stocks may be doing badly precisely because they are too big for even the biggest amounts of cash to take over. No-one is going to take General Electric private.Deals are getting bigger, as the barbarians set their sites on ever larger targets. But while the mega-caps remain beyond their reach, they seem fated to underperform, even though they look like good value.
497;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;‘Voodoo notions’ of private equity must be debunked;;The private equity boom goes on, with a £10bn approach for Alliance Boots, the UK pharmacy group, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’ $26bn acquisition of First Data, a US credit card processing group.Critics say companies are selling out too easily. But, in contrast to the remarks that private equity operators are “locusts” and people who “buy it, strip it and flip it”, Gordon Brown, Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer, has said that private equity firms are to be congratulated for creating jobs at a faster rate than listed companies.An executive at the London office of a big US private equity manager has been quoted as saying: “This whole idea of asset stripping, firing half the workforce and leaving a company as a wreck is complete nonsense. If we did that, we would be out of business. We need to debunk all these voodoo notions that are being bandied about.”What are the facts? In the UK, the statistics indicate that one in five employees in the private sector are employed by companies owned by private equity funds. The growth in jobs at these companies has been 9 per cent a year over the past few years, compared with 1 per cent at FTSE 100 companies. Not only has job creation been superior, but the returns to investors in private equity funds have also been superior to returns from listed equities.More institutions are investing in private equity funds. The largest investors today are pension funds: private equity investments have given their members a superior return. The bulk of the profits are distributed to the investors, ultimately persons in the street. Managers of private equity funds invest in them at the insistence of institutional investors. Management’s investment in private equity funds rarely exceeds 5 per cent of the funds.Management schemes in private equity transactions are structured so that there is an alignment between the institutional investor and management. Managers do not share only in the upside, as in the traditional share option scheme. They have to participate in the upside and the downside.A “voodoo notion” is that there is less transparency for investors in private equity-owned companies. The reality is that the institutional investor has unrestricted access to management. Discussion between the two is absolutely transparent and the investors urge managers from time to time to change course strategically. Managers in turn regularly share issues with the investors. Managers and investors are not restricted by insider trading regulations. The institutional owner of shares in a listed company can only discuss with executives issues that are in the public domain. Consequently, there is greater disclosure to the providers of capital in a company owned by a private equity fund than in a publicly listed company. Management and ownership are not split.Then there are the notions of a lack of compliance and reporting. Publicly owned companies listed on exchanges are driven by short-term issues. They have to report every three months in some jurisdictions, in others every six months. Management is measured on short-term issues and compliance-driven. The management of a private equity fund company is measured and rewarded on long-term strategic issues and the achievement of a hurdle rate of return many points above the long-term cost of capital and borrowing. In private equity, there is a freedom from an almost mindless compliance with regulations. The reporting to investors is quick and absolutely transparent.Another issue is decision-making. In a private equity context, it is much quicker than in a listed company. The decision is made after a direct communication between the owner-investors and management.Private equity’s detractors are calling for regulation. From the facts, it appears rather that the regulations surrounding listed companies should be re-examined. In private equity, because of the growing investment by pension funds, it is ordinary people who are benefiting far more than the managers.Because of these “voodoo notions”, the British Venture Capital Association, to which UK private equity firms belong, has set up a working party to devise a code of conduct for private equity firms. The plan is to issue a report later this year.When it is realised that the success of private equity has benefited millions and not only the managers, and there is a generally accepted code of conduct, perhaps the “voodoo notions” will be debunked.The writer is an international corporate governance expert who chaired the United Nations Governance and Oversight Committee
498;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-02T21:03:35Z;Bolloré keeps battling for Aegis board seats;;Hardly a week goes by without Vincent Bolloré giving a newspaper interview to press his case for two seats on the board of Aegis, the UK-based media buyer in which he has built a 29.1 per cent stake. For someone who normally prefers to avoid the public limelight, that may seem a bit strange.But then the French corporate raider at the head of a €6bn diverse family industrial empire probably never expected such stiff opposition from the Aegis management and board. All the more so given that UK law gives far greater power to shareholders to influence company boards than similar rules in the US and other European countries.Simply put, UK shareholders can call extraordinary meetings with 10 per cent of the voting share capital and put forward propositions to remove any and all directors if more than 50 per cent of votes cast favour the resolution. With such a large stake in Aegis, it should have been a simple formality for Mr Bolloré to secure his two new board seats.Not so – and the French businessman has thus had to resort to the classic tactics of activist shareholders by making as much noise as possible in continental Europe to try to put pressure on other shareholders as well as win public and political support to force change.The irony is that Mr Bolloré seems to have had a far easier ride in Italy, a country notorious for its board-friendly system propped up by big shareholding blocs and crony networks to frustrate activists and other minority shareholders.The affable Frenchman readily admits that when his group decides to invest in a company “people get a bit scared”. This was the case in Italy seven years ago when he took a stake in Mediobanca, the Milan investment bank at the heart of Italian big business. Yet over the years, Mr Bolloré claims, attitudes to his group have changed as it has shown to be a “good long-term partner” for Mediobanca and its main asset, Assicurazioni Generali.He says he is also investing in the long term with Aegis. He will repeat this message tomorrow at a shareholders meeting where he will again ask for two seats on the UK company’s board. He argues his demands are perfectly reasonable. He says he is not seeking creeping control as the Aegis board has claimed, but an opportunity to discuss and participate in the life of the company as any shareholder with 29.1 per cent should be able to do.Mr Bolloré has already tried twice and failed to get his way at Aegis. If, as expected, he fails again this week, he will simply keep trying until his message finally seeps through. He intends to keep calling three shareholders meetings a year to press his case because two would seem “lazy” and four “excessive”.He also says he intends to be around until 2022 when his family company will celebrate its bicentennial. “You know, our raison d’être is not just to get into Aegis. We have many other interests and activities. But we are also very patient and ultimately I think we will make ourselves understood by Aegis and its other shareholders.” That is bound to mean making much more noise and a stream of fresh newspaper interviews.No foreigners pleaseIt is difficult to be a foreign manager or one with extensive foreign experience in Germany these days. Harry Roels – RWE’s Dutch-born boss – was jettisoned by the utility’s supervisory board largely because of his focus purely upon a shareholder-friendly policy and an unwillingness to cultivate political relationships.Similarly Swedish manager Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive of MAN, ran into problems when he launched a totally capital market-focused bid for fellow truckmaker Scania. Despite saying he did not understand German business networks, his supervisory board singularly failed to help him.Then there are the difficulties of Swiss-born Deutsche Bank head Josef Ackermann – long the bogeyman of German capitalism – and his replacement as bogeyman, Klaus Kleinfeld, chief executive of Siemens. Mr Kleinfeld is German, but defined by his experience in the US. So it seems that more internationally focused managers are having a hard time bedding down.That is a pity. As German companies become even more global and foreign shareholders increase, an outside perspective in the boardroom is important. After all, Mr Roels and Mr Samuelsson have managed to shake up extremely traditional companies. Mr Ackermann has turned Deutsche Bank into an international contender. Mr Kleinfeld – for all the scandals surrounding Siemens – seems to be grasping the need to focus the sprawling conglomerate.Supervisory boards are still a problem. They are far too German, with some – such as Volkswagen – entirely made up of Germans, though the company earns 80 per cent of its money outside its home market.Yet there are some encouraging signs. Mr Ackermann has weathered the storm despite not deviating from his strategy in five years. This month a magazine voted him the second most-respected manager in Germany, as Mr Kleinfeld enviously noted. richard.milne@ft.comProton a make-or-break test for Malaysian reformMalaysia is not in a strong negotiating position as it enters the final phase of talks with Volkswagen on the sale of Proton, the national carmaker. Not only is Proton losing money, but Abdullah Badawi, the Malaysian prime minister, is under pressure to convince foreign investors that the country welcomes their money.Mr Abdullah is a strong advocate of foreign direct investment to revitalise the economy and improve its competitiveness, but he has suffered setbacks. Malaysia failed to conclude a free trade pact with the US in time to take advantage of the fast-track authority to gain congressional approval without amendments.The sticking point was Malaysia’s refusal to relax affirmative action rules benefiting the ethnic Malay majority when it comes to government procurement. The prime minister has sought to ease the rules in Malaysia’s biggest planned special economic zone, but is coming under fire from political rivals for doing so.The Proton sale is a make-or-break test of whether Mr Abdullah can face down entrenched nationalists who oppose his economic reforms.The failure to find a foreign strategic partner for Proton, which it desperately needs, would be seen as further proof that the prime minister is losing momentum in trying to restructure Malaysia. So he is likely to push for a deal with VW in spite of the political risks. johnburtonft@yahoo.comCelesio’s strange courtshipUntil the weekend, you would have put Celesio of Germany and Britain’s Alliance Boots – each of which owns drug wholesalers and retail pharmacies – on opposite sides in most battles. The German company is among several challenging a deal struck by Pfizer to use Alliance Boots as its sole drug distribution company in Britain. Last year, it appealed, unsuccessfully, against Alliance Unichem’s merger with Boots, arguing that the UK antitrust authorities had misread the local market, where Celesio owns more than 1,500 “community” pharmacies.Yet now, Celesio is trying to find a financial partner to bid for Alliance Boots and trump the offer being put together by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm. It is, to say the least, an unorthodox courtship.The timing of the Celesio approach has an opportunistic logic. Having just opened Alliance Boots’ books to KKR, the target’s board is ready to recommend a deal at a generous price of £10.40 a share. The presence of another potential bidder could slow down the process. But it is hard to discern a strategy through the tactics. If Celesio found a partner to outbid KKR, it could add some of Alliance Boots’ 1,500 community pharmacies to its Lloyds Pharmacy chain.This could be the last chance for Celesio to unwind last year’s deal. But continued ownership by Celesio of the wholesale arm would surely be off-limits on competition grounds – Celesio, Alliance Boots and Phoenix, another German company, dominate the European market. What is more, KKR’s ally Stefano Pessina, the wholesaling brains behind the Alliance Unichem/Boots merger, has made clear that he will not throw in his lot – and his 15 per cent stake – with another bidder.Alliance Boots’ board is duty-bound to look at any sensible offer – and it would be good for other shareholders if somebody were to challenge Mr Pessina’s stance. But, as the immobility of Alliance Boots’ share price Monday suggests, Celesio has a long way to go to convince the directors that it is serious enough to be given access to the accounts. andrew.hill@ft.comeuropean.view@ft.comworld.view@ft.com

To bears, Monday’s trading statement was a profit warning – unexpected and unwelcome – loading an additional £20m-£30m of costs on to the year to March 2008. To bulls, these costs are further necessary investments in promising areas, such as broadband and the joint ventures in the US and France. More detailed clues to the underlying performance – such as progress in integrating AOL’s UK internet access business – will only be revealed to analysts later this month.Take the additional cost of broadband customer service. Overwhelmed by the success of its “free” Talk Talk offer last year, Carphone had to do some hasty hiring in order to cope with the demand. Charles Dunstone, the Carphone chief executive, employed his most winning manner on a blog in order to placate customers as they waited in line. His last posting was just before Christmas – which may or may not be a sign that things are getting better. On Monday, he told analysts: “We’ve dragged ourselves up to the same bad level as the rest of the industry.” Half of the additional group costs for this financial year will pay for maintaining these additional staff, while the number of customers catches up and the number of complaints falls. Of course, if either measure moves in the other direction, those extra costs will persist.More positively, Carphone has managed to accelerate the migration of customers to “unbundled” lines. A bundled customer costs Carphone Warehouse £5 a month – mainly paid to BT for the privilege of using its exchanges – while an unbundled one generates £7 in profit. Although that trend was welcomed, some analysts trimmed their profit forecasts. Carphone Warehouse now trades on a multiple of 13 or 14 times prospective earnings for 2008. The 24 per cent decline in the share price since last October makes that seem fair.Wrist managementPrivate equity’s hold on British boardrooms goes beyond companies that are facing potential buy-outs, such as Alliance Boots or J Sainsbury. Most directors must have asked themselves in the past 12 months how they could apply some of private equity’s techniques to their business.To help board members focus on value creation and balance sheet efficiency, it may therefore be time to mint a new rubber wristband – modelled on those worn by activist Christians in the US and elsewhere – with the legend WWPED: What Would Private Equity Do?andrew.hill@ft.comwww.ft.com/lombard
500;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-04-01T18:58:51Z;Celesio joins Alliance Boots hunt;;"The potential £10bn (€14.8bn) acquisition of Alliance Boots by its deputy chairman and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts was facing two new hurdles on Sunday after the emergence of a rival suitor and fresh concerns over its pension fund.Celesio, the German pharmacy group, has hired NM Rothschild to sound out private equity firms to trump the approach of Stefano Pessina and KKR, his private equity backer.The German company, which owns the Lloydspharmacy chain in the UK, is in the early stages of trying to form a rival consortium that would try to top KKR’s indicative £10.40-a-share offer and then split up Boots and share its assets.Although Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Boots, agreed last Friday to allow KKR and Mr Pessina to carry out due diligence – and the board has indicated it would approve a firm offer at £10.40 a share – he would also open the books to any other serious bidder.Meanwhile, Boots’ pension trustees have commissioned an “emergency valuation” of its pension fund, underscoring the prospect that the scheme could stand in the way of a deal as it has in the other potential private equity acquisition of a FTSE 100 retailer – the CVC-led consortium’s approach for J Sainsbury, the supermarket chain.Trustees to the Boots pension scheme, suspecting the company could be the target of a highly leveraged bid, developed an action plan several months ago.On the day the company was approached last month, trustees and their advisers assembled at Boots’ Nottingham headquarters.They are understood to have commissioned an emergency valuation to bring the scheme’s assumptions up to date with variables such as the improving life expectancy of members.Analysts at Morgan Stanley on Friday said there could be a £2bn “black hole” in the Boots pension scheme. “Since 2004 pension fund trustees have had wide-ranging powers,” the research note warned. “Their sole obligation is to protect members’ interests. They have no obligations to shareholders and do not need to negotiate.”But KKR and Mr Pessina are understood to believe both obstacles will be surmounted. The Boots pension scheme is widely believed to be well-funded; it was one of the first to replace much of its equity assets with bonds.Mr Pessina, who is Boots’ largest shareholder with a 15 per cent stake, has ruled out working with a rival to KKR and has indicated he will likely walk away from the company if unsuccessful in his bid to take it private."
501;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
502;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-31T00:05:45Z;Boots set to accept KKR’s £10bn offer;;Private equity looked set to capture its first FTSE 100 scalp after Alliance Boots signalled its readiness to accept a £10bn indicative offer from its deputy chairman and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.The purchase of Boots would be Europe’s largest and the UK’s most high-profile buy-out. It would ensure even greater scrutiny of the private equity industry, which faces growing criticism in Britain.The Transport and General Workers’ Union said Friday it would be “regrettable” if the deal went ahead and called for more regulation of the industry.Trade union groups have rounded on private equity firms, accusing them of being short-termist asset-strippers.J Sainsbury is also in private equity’s sights, with a CVC-led consortium stalking the supermarket.Alliance Boots, which was formed only last year with the merger of Boots and Alliance UniChem, agreed to open its books after the bidders returned with an approach of £10.40 a share – a 40p increase on their original bid, which the company had rejected.The market was Friday expecting a bid to go ahead. Shares closed at £10.26½, in line with the offer, which includes an expected 13p dividend.Those close to both parties said Friday that the Boots board is ready to grant its recommendation, raising expectations that the deal will go ahead after two to three weeks of due diligence.Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Boots and its largest shareholder with a 15 per cent stake, shocked investors this month by announcing he was joining forces with KKR to take the company private.Mr Pessina indicated Friday that he would walk away from the company if the new offer failed. He has also ruled out working with any backer other than KKR. Mr Pessina said: “I have always looked at most private equity funds with suspicion.“I have never been tempted by people or banks trying to approach me proposing different deals …but I became convinced that KKR shared my long-term vision.”KKR repeatedly insisted in a statement that its plans for the group were long-term and it would “invest further” in Boots.Henry Kravis, co-founder of KKR, phoned Sir Nigel Rudd, Boots chairman, to stress that, barring a drastic shock in the books, his team intends to submit a firm offer of £10.40 a share.However, the deal could still be derailed by the group’s pension deficit.Analysts at Morgan Stanley warned Friday that there could be a £2bn “black hole” in the Boots pension scheme.
503;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Alliance Boots: no choice but to accept this bid;;"A messy process yields a generous priceFirst things first. The £10.40 price now suggested by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for Alliance Boots looks generous.Investors may have two lingering fears. One is that KKR or its bankers will see something they dislike in the company’s books and back away or reduce the offer price. That would be a disaster for all. Getting sufficient reassurance that it won’t happen has rightly been one of Sir Nigel Rudd’s main priorities as chairman.A second concern is that Stefano Pessina, the strategic driving force behind the company and the man whom KKR approached in February, has a secret weapon. Once Alliance Boots is taken private, Mr Pessina will wield it to elevate the retail pharmacy and drug wholesaler into a different league.If there is such a weapon, it is probably Mr Pessina’s gut instinct. Not only is this instinct hard to value, it would almost certainly be unavailable to Alliance Boots if shareholders rejected the KKR offer.The deep involvement of the Italian entrepreneur has forced Sir Nigel to navigate round the most awkward set of conflicts yet seen in a buy-out. But it has also given the chairman and the board a straight – if unpalatable – choice between continuing with an ambitious strategy in the public markets without its chief architect, or extracting the best possible price now.The foundation for this messy outcome was laid at the time of the Alliance Boots merger. The post-mortem will go on for months. But this is not the time to insist on points of principle. If this bid is formalised, the board will recommend it and shareholders should accept it.He shoots, he scores“Lord Reith, David Dimbleby, Jonathan Ross, Mark Thompson – Mark Thompson, can you hear me? Mark Thompson! Your boys took a hell of a beating! Your boys took a hell of a beating!”Michael Grade must have been tempted yesterday to echo the infamous Norwegian football commentary, the night England went down 2-1 to Norway in Oslo. The BBC, Mr Grade’s old employer, is the loser in the contest for live rights to the FA Cup and England home internationals; ITV, his new home, looks to be the biggest winner.Sports rights and pornography are the two sure-fire ways of attracting viewers. If pornographer-in-chief is unavailable (it is a role Mr Grade has already essayed and probably would not go down as well with the target audience at ITV as it did at Channel 4), then sports-promoter-in-chief will do instead. But, positive PR aside, is this the “seriously good commercial deal” ITV’s chairman says it is?ITV and Setanta Sports are paying at least a third more per year for the rights than the BBC and British Sky Broadcasting paid for the current deal, which expires after the 2007-08 season, but still less than the BBC/BSkyB contract in force at the start of this decade. Even so, Toby Syfret, media analyst at Enders Analysis, estimates that after production costs, ITV will lose money on each game it televises under the new deal.The real value is that ITV will be able to exploit the rights in order to rebuild ITV1’s audience of men aged 16 to 34 and justify premium advertising rates. This deal gives the main terrestrial commercial channel greater “reach” – after volume, the most important measure for advertisers.Counter-intuitively, while it leaves the BBC dependent on football highlights and ring-fenced live coverage of events such as the World Cup, it is not bad for Sky. The satellite channel controlled by Rupert Murdoch still has a very wide offering of Premiership and other games and can put the money saved into other programming. The fact that BSkyB lost to ITV in a straight fight when regulators are examining whether it is abusing its dominance is an unexpected bonus. What is more, as an 18 per cent shareholder in ITV, what is good for Mr Grade ought to be good for Mr Murdoch.Britain’s bulging bankerBarclays may still be something of a plucky upstart in investment banking, but it is very much in the “bulge bracket” when it comes to paying its president. The news this week that Bob Diamond took home a package of £22m last year generated predictable adverse comment in the UK, but he can look his counterparts in the US squarely in the eye. In dollar terms, the only Wall Street chief executives to earn more last year were Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Stan O’Neal of Merrill Lynch. John Mack, chairman and chief executive of Morgan Stanley had to make do with $41m (£21m).Given that the businesses Mr Diamond oversees probably make more profit after tax than Lehman Brothers, these numbers do not seem so outlandish. But other British banks are not keeping up. Johnny Cameron, who has overseen the rapid growth of Royal Bank of Scotland’s capital markets business, pocketed about £3.5m last year. Edinburgh still looks a long way from Wall Street."
504;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-30T11:46:36Z;Bankers cheer Boots;;If you hear cheering in the City today it will be the sound of investment bankers rejoicing at what looks set to be the first successful private equity bid for a FTSE 100 company. Regardless of whether they’re in on the Alliance Boots bid, they all want to see it go through to encourage others.And it looks like it will. This morning KKR and Stefano Pessina raised their offer for Alliance Boots from £10 to £10.40. In return, Boots is giving them access to the books, not that Pessina needs it. The increase, which includes the 19p dividend, looks a little miserly but it’s probably enough. There isn’t much sign of a rival offer and it is notable that the Boots share price has not shot through the new offer price.A successful take-private of Boots will not necessarily encourage others – not all FTSE 100 companies have an executive director able and willing to throw in 15 per cent of the shares behind a bid and not all have as well-funded a pension scheme – but it should help.It is a big pay-day at New Star Asset Management. The directors are selling £210m-worth of shares (founder John Duffield is almost halving his stake). I think they have to sell some in order to get the free float up ahead of moving from Aim to the main list. They are also paying themselves and other shareholders a huge dividend, the net effect of which for Duffield is a cheque of nearly £160m. And well-deserved it is, too.No deal at Resolution. This seemed likely to be the case when Paul Thompson declared he was off earlier this month and Lombard predicted as much. Still, the stock is off 5 per cent today.We have confirmation also today of our story this morning that Man Group is to demerge its US brokerage arm and list it in New York in a move that could value Man Financial at $5bn (£2.5bn).Keep an eye on Vodafone. It is having an investor day which runs from 9 this morning to 5pm. It can’t be going very well: the shares are down more than 4 per cent already. So far, the highlights have included news of a tie-up with Asda similar to Tesco’s very successful one with O2 and an admission by the UK boss that they have struggled here and had to sacrifice margins to grow. There has been more talk about making mobile internet a reality and Vittorio Colao, the new deputy CEO and European head, kept his remarks nice and dull. Which is probably just how the press team will have wanted it after all the talk that he was being brought in to succeed Arun Sarin. The Q&A session just after 4pm may yield more.Also, will BA intervene in TPG’s bid for Iberia? You have to think it would like to but much may depend on which operator TPG has teamed up with. BA’s 10 per cent stake puts it in a reasonably good position.Rumour of the day: Neil Hume on our markets desk is hearing that Adecco may be looking at Hays.

505;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-29T08:54:15Z;Private equity’s retail returns ’to be lower’;;John Lovering, chairman of Debenhams and serial dealmaker, said on Wednesday that he expected returns in private equity to be lower over the next five to ten years given the ”wall of money” that has flowed into the industry in recent years.Speaking on a well-attended private equity panel at the World Retail Congress with Jonathan Feuer, partner at CVC, and John Pfeffer of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the chairman of the recently-floated Debenhams said that flow of capital made it harder to pull off high return deals.He also said big deals - the CVC-led potential £11bn-plus takeover deal of J Sainsbury and KKR’s proposed acquisition of Alliance Boots - were becoming more challenging in the face of ever-growing public scrutiny.Asked about the likelihood of the Sainsbury deal coming off, Mr Lovering said negotiations with pension trustees ”was an issue” for the industry.”As deals get bigger in the retail space, the public think they own the retailers as well as shareholders and we are moving into areas of public relations and the odds of doing these deals are much harder than when you are an entrepreneur or doing small companies,” he said.Mr Feuer and Mr Pfeffer declined to comment on both Alliance Boots and Sainsbury at a plenary session on Wednesday. CVC, Blackstone Group, Texas Pacific Group and KKR have until April 13 to table an offer for J Sainsbury or walk away. However, it has to iron out the pension issue before it can even approach the board with a potential offer for the company.Mr Lovering also said that management teams would be in a stronger position in the coming years. ”Fund returns for five to 10 years will be lower and the premium for management will go up, because only transformational strategies will be the differential strategies over the next decade, so the desire for strong management will rise.”It is thought that the CVC-led consortium are very keen to keep Justin King, chief executive of Sainbsury, and his management team on board should it succeed in taking the retailer private, while KKR has teamed up with Stefano Pessina, Alliance Boots’ executive deputy chairman and biggest shareholder, in its efforts to take over the drugs wholesale and retail chain.
506;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-28T21:20:07Z;Sainsbury, Boots try to fend off predators;;Alliance Boots and J Sainsbury on Wednesday sought to strengthen their hands against the private equity predators stalking them with the publication of trading updates.While the two FTSE 100 retailers were using the opportunity to paint their performances in the best possible light, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance Boots, were fine-tuning an improvement to their £9.7bn offer, which was rejected by the pharmacy group’s board earlier this month.Meanwhile, the CVC-led consortium circling Sainsbury was wrestling with the supermarket group’s large pension deficit, which remains a potent obstacle to a firm offer.Alliance Boots’ trading update – long at seven pages and more reminiscent of a defence document – contained plenty of optimistic talk and detailed a rise in fourth-quarter sales, 300 job cuts and a £65m rebranding exercise.Richard Baker, chief executive, insisted it was not a disguised defence document. “I think it says ‘trading statement’ at the top and that’s a very good way of describing it,” he said.Analysts were, in any case, unimpressed by the 1.6 per cent increase in underlying UK retail sales and the fact that debt of “slightly lower than” £1.2bn was higher than consensus forecasts.KKR and Mr Pessina are understood to believe that the update strengthens their hand, supporting their contention that there is no hidden value in the company. Nonetheless, the team is expected to increase its £10-a-share indicative offer in the next few days.Mr Baker tried to ease concerns over potential conflicts of interest in the boardroom, saying: “Stefano remains a director of the company [responsible for] corporate strategy and mergers and acquisitions . . . He continues to fulfil his responsibilities but has no involvement in any matter connected with the approach.” Refusing to answer more questions on his fellow director, he said: “I’m on a strictly lawyered quote.”Richard Ratner, analyst at Seymour Pierce, said: “We believe that the bidders will come back at somewhere around £10.40 and then it is likely that Boots management will roll over gracefully.”Unlike Alliance Boots, Sainsbury beat the most optimistic forecasts of like-for-like sales growth with a 5.9 per cent increase. Justin King, chief executive, boasted that he had achieved “growth on growth on growth” as he led the supermarket group through a recovery.He said he was keeping staff informed: “If people know what’s going on in an open and honest way as soon as they can, then that removes most of the worry.” In fact, more than a quarter of Sainsbury staff have profited from the takeover speculation. Mr King said more than 40,000 of the 150,000 staff had shares or options in the company.In a Merrill Lynch research note entitled “Great trading …now back to the pension”, John Kershaw said that although the pension deficit would be the consortium’s greatest concern, the improved trading – which could add £15m to pre-tax profit – helped justify a bid as high as 600p.Shares in Sainsbury rose 1p on Thursday to 552p. Alliance Boots shares fell 8p to £10.13.Additional reporting by Lina Saigol and Elizabeth Rigby
507;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-28T13:28:58Z;Alliance Boots outlines growth plan;;Alliance Boots, the drug wholesaler and retailer which earlier this month rebuffed a £10 a share bid, moved to reassure shareholders that it could deliver strong growth as a public company as it updated the market on current trading.The detailed trading statement was interpreted by some as a de facto defence document in light of expectations that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Stefano Pessina, deputy chairman, will come back with an offer which could be as high as £10.60 a share.In the statement, Alliance Boots announced plans to rebrand the bulk of its 900-strong community pharmacy estate, trumpeted as the biggest single expansion of the Boots brand in its history, over the next two years.It will invest £65m in rebranding the stores “your local boots pharmacy”, and will overhaul its pharmacy management system over the next three years. It has also identified 100 locations where it will relocate or close stores at a cost of about £35m.Alliance Boots was at pains to underscore its international credentials, saying that while plans to expand overseas were at an early stage of development, it remained confident about the potential over the longer term. In January it announced a joint venture in China with Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals, following its entry into Russia last year.Richard Baker, chief executive, said: “These plans, allied to our 2006/7 results reaffirm the board’s view that as a leading international pharmacy-led health and beauty group with attractive prospects, opportunities and synergies, Alliance Boots can drive sustained growth in shareholder value.”Investors have ratcheted up pressure on the group to provide details of internal business plans to understand exactly why the group cannot do as a public company what Mr Pessina and KKR would like it to do as a private one. Investors have been keen to make sure they are privy to the same information as Mr Pessina and KKR.Asked about the level of detail in the statement, Richard Baker, chief executive, said: “We want to be extremely transparent to shareholders, given the offer period we’re in at the moment.”Boots said it expected like-for like growth in the final quarter to be about 1.6 per cent for its retail division adding that full-year results were expected to be in line.The new initiatives will incur about £75m of exceptional costs before tax.Alliance Boots was formed last year through the merger of Boots and Alliance Unichem. Earlier this month, Merrill Lynch stepped down as broker to Alliance Boots to work as an adviser to Stefano Pessina, the retailer’s largest shareholder and KKR after their £9.7bn offer for the chain was rebuffed. The highly unusual move added to expectations that the consortium was planning to raise its offer after its indicative approach, worth £10 a share, was rejected by the Alliance Boots board.Alliance Boots added that it would make 300 redundancies at its Nottingham factory following the end of a supply contract with Reckitt Benckiser, the consumer goods company.The shares, which have risen sharply since the £10 approach, dipped 3p or 0.3 per cent to £10.18 in early afternoon trading.
508;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-28T13:27:33Z;Jessops warns yet again;;This morning we were greeted with the sight of both Alliance Boots and J Sainsbury bending over backwards to look like they have real growth plans despite the conflicts of interest on their boards as they face possible bids.In a nine-page trading statement, Alliance Boots announced plans to rebrand the bulk of its 900-strong community pharmacy estate, streamline the pharmacy management system and reshuffle its store portfolio. Investors managed to contain their excitement, leaving the shares unchanged. Which is very convenient for Stefano Pessina, who wants to buy the group with backing from KKR. If this was a de facto defence, it was feeble.Sainsbury’s did a little better at trying to look good, despite the fact that its chief executive, Justin King, stands to do very well if a private equity consortium buys the group and, as expected, keeps him on board. It produced a 5.9 per cent increase in like-for-like sales excluding fuel, which was ahead of expectations. However, there seemed to be no attempt by the company to come up with any new ideas. The shares, consequently, have barely moved.There is a lot other retail news today, not all of it good. Woolworths managed to turn in an even worse trading update than expected (and nobody expected very much). Laura Ashley, on the other hand, has turned in its best full-year profit in a decade. Sales were good and so were margins.And Jessops, which is being hit by digital cameras getting cheaper, has managed yet another profits warning (its third in less than four months if I’m counting right). It says it will make a loss, scrap its dividend, conduct a strategic review and is in talks with its banks. Its non-executive chairman, Gavin Simonds, is off, saying he can’t commit as much time as the company needs, and the commercial director has resigned. The shares have fallen more than 70 per cent since the announcement came out just after 1pm and are 90 per cent below their float price in October 2004. What a mess.Those for whom that is not enough retail news can keep up to speed with the goings on at the World Retail Congress in Barcelona through FT.com. Beth Rigby, our retail correspondent, has organised a terrific line-up of high-profile video interviews which you will be able to watch online all week.Elsewhere, Royal Dutch Shell says chief executive Jeroen van der Veer will continue in his post until June 2009, extending his contract by a year and taking him past the normal retirement age, we think. Malcolm Brinded, head of exploration and production, is the favourite to succeed him.And Daily Mail & General Trust sees signs of a tentative recovery in the ad market. Finance director Peter Williams says he is not interested in the Trinity Mirror regional titles, which is just as well as he has his hands full with his own regional repair job.Rumour of the day: Next shares are powering ahead again on LBO rumours.

509;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-22T19:13:35Z;M&S builds defence for bondholders;;"The growing influence of private equity was illustrated on Thursday when Marks and Spencer, Britain’s largest clothing retailer, for the first time promised to protect its bondholders from a potential leveraged buy-out.M&S’s decision to issue a change-of-control clause on its bonds is part of a growing trend among European investment-grade companies, which in the past have not carried strict covenants on their assets.The company has promised to buy back its bonds at par in the event of an LBO, which can lead to a company and its bonds being cut to junk because private equity groups typically take on more debt. M&S is rated BBB by Standard & Poor’s and Baa2 by Moody’s, two notches above junk grade.With private equity speculation swirling around other British retailers, such as
J. Sainsbury and Alliance Boots, M&S wanted to reassure investors that they would not end up with big losses as a consequence of their bonds being downgraded to junk.Holly Grainger, credit analyst at Morley Fund Management, said: “This is good news for investors, as the more protection from potential negative credit events we can get, the better.”Investors said bid talk around Sainsbury and Alliance Boots had increased the need for a change of control clause. In the past month Sainsbury has been targeted by a private equity consortium led by CVC, while Alliance Boots is facing the prospect of being taken private by a management buy-out.Although M&S is an unlikely LBO target, because its share price has risen sharply in the past year, the sheer size of the private equity war chest means such a possibility cannot be ruled out, investors said.Private equity raised close to €90bn in 2006 for European buy-outs, almost double the amount in the previous year, according to Standard & Poor’s.M&S raised £400m in a fixed-rate bond that priced at 77 basis points over gilts, much tighter than initial guidance, reflecting strong investor interest, in spite of more difficult market conditions following the global equity market sell-off late last month. Banks managing the deal were Citigroup, HSBC and Morgan Stanley.Sarwat Faruqui, European head of investment grade corporates at Citigroup,
said: “The change-of-control clause was important for a good price. This was a prerequisite for most investors. Once that concern was
taken care of, people were extremely happy with the credit.”"
510;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-20T17:24:09Z;Pharmacies take the drugs test;;"Irani Jumnoodoo’s eyes widened as the 83-year-old pensioner sitting opposite lifted up a bulky “medicines bag” and emptied a dozen different drugs that she uses on to the desk in the smart but tiny consulting room in West Wickham.Twenty minutes later, Ms Jumnoodoo, a pharmacist with the Lloydspharmacy chain, had explained to her client how to use an asthmatic spray properly, had thrown away two medicines that she should not have been taking and had told her to ask her about taking sleeping pills less often and calcium tablets more frequently.“Patients are really grateful, because many are not taking their medicines as they should and their never has the time to review them,” she says afterwards. “And I really enjoy doing it, because it’s what I was trained to do.”The meeting was one of a growing number of innovative “medicines use reviews” (MURs) taking place in chemists’ shops across the UK, which are designed to take pressure off doctors and use pharmacists’ skills to the full to tackle the
problem of inappropriate use of drugs.Pharmacists’ willingness to embrace MURs reflects their appetite to move away from the traditional model of high street retailing towards the higher value services that are likely to grow with the restructuring of the National Health Service.Yet the experience demonstrates the difficulties for private companies in dealing with a state-funded, centralised structure such as the NHS. Managerial challenges include wide variations in uptake, the cost of setting up services and marketing them to often suspicious doctors.“This type of service will transform the role of pharmacy,” argues Justin Ash, managing director of Lloydspharmacy, owned by Celesio of Germany. He believes his company – with more than 210,000 MURs completed to date – has undertaken the bulk of all the reviews carried out in England and Wales.By the start of this year, Boots had performed another 81,000, with 2,300 pharmacists accredited and a further 1,000 being trained. Tesco is a significant participant, and some smaller chains and single-outlet pharmacies are also carrying them out.When the British government launched MURs in 2005, they were part of a broader new commercial contract negotiated with pharmacies, which make a margin on the reimbursement of prescription drugs for NHS patients. For the first time, pharmacies were to provide consultations with patients to discuss their medicines – and be paid by the NHS for doing so. Primary care trusts were authorised to pay £25 for each MUR undertaken.Some of the larger pharmacies were so keen to adopt the new scheme that the government twice raised its annual quota of MURs conducted per pharmacy: initially from 200 to 250 in 2005, and then again in October last year to 400.Overall, however, such figures conceal a slow uptake across the country. A survey published last month in the Pharmaceutical Journal by Alison Blenkinsopp, professor of the practice of pharmacy in the department of medicines management at Keele University, provided the first detailed snapshot.From a sample of 28 primary care trusts in England and Wales polled in summer 2006, her team found that just 38 per cent of pharmacies had claimed payment for undertaking MURs during the scheme’s first year of operation. Only 7 per cent of the total funds allocated had been spent.One reason was a sharp decline in use below the leading chains, which account for 57 per cent of all British pharmacies but were 71 per cent of those that undertook MURs in the sample. “Further action is now urgently needed to support and embed the MUR service,” the research concluded.Coverage remains patchy for a number of reasons. Participating pharmacists must be specially trained, and their pharmacies accredited. Approval requires the installation of a private consulting room for discussions with patients, eliminating retail space with the pressure that brings on sales.It may mean hiring additional staff to cover
for trained pharmacists providing MURs. Add in the paperwork (the required form is filled in by hand) and administration, and each review can easily consume more than 30 minutes of a professional’s time. For single shop pharmacies, that represents a considerable burden.Mr Ash says that Lloyds­pharmacy has invested several million pounds in MURs, setting up IT systems and administrative processes to handle the data – costs that can be absorbed across many outlets. He is willing to assume the costs as part of a strategy to shift from the sale of non-medical staples such as shampoos towards higher value-added work, which he sees as building customer loyalty and strengthening links with doctors.Other such services include blood pressure and diabetes testing, and a coronary heart check-up. The company also recently launched an advisory service to doctors on switching to equivalent but less costly generic drugs.The pain of sacrificing floor space has been eased for Lloydspharmacy by its decision to locate not on traditional high streets, but in rented shops on lower-cost “secondary” high streets or directly in health centres.More generally, there has been some suspicion from doctors. Barry Patrick, manager of the West Wickham branch, says: “GPs were quite apprehensive. Many thought there would be a lot of paperwork and not much added value. But once they have seen how it improves compliance and patients’ quality of life, they see there is a real need.”Hamish Meldrew, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, says MURs are not a cause for concern. “We’re not against the concept of a partnership. Doctors diagnose and initiate treatment, and pharmacists use their knowledge of drugs and interactions. The two can work together.”Nevertheless, Prof Blen­kinsopp’s study shows some doctors do question the value of the scheme, and even claim that pharmacies have been tempted to favour quantity over quality, failing to understand MURs’ purpose, filling out the evaluations poorly or not focusing on priority groups.“It’s a service with great potential, given the quantities of medicines that are unused, but there is insufficient hard evidence to make a judgment on its effectiveness,” she says.Perhaps surprisingly for a national programme, the department of health has not assessed the performance of the scheme saying evaluations should be done by primary care trusts. Lloyds­pharmacy’s own figures – based on a survey among its outlets last summer – show that two-thirds of its MURs identified problems that patients were having with their medicines. A quarter led to GP referrals.That should be good news for big pharmacies, the NHS and patients alike. For the independent pharmacies, it may not be enough to tilt the balance unless they are provided with more incentives to take part."
511;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-14T20:30:31Z;Pessina must signal he is open to the alternatives;;A lesson for all management buy-outsAlliance Boots’ shareholders are worried that Stefano Pessina is underpricing his proposed £9.7bn management buy-out for the retail and wholesale chemist, where he is deputy chairman. How can Mr Pessina prove that if he makes a formal offer, it fully reflects his assessment of the company’s fair value?One elegant solution was mooted in a lecture on management buy-outs this week by Paul Myners, the former chairman of Marks and Spencer.Mr Myners suggests that whenever managers want to buy a company in which they own a big stake, they should make a final offer and agree to sell their shares to any higher counterbid that subsequently emerges.Adopting this principle would address the conflicts of interest at Alliance Boots. Mr Pessina owns 15 per cent of the company. By structuring a bid as Mr Myners suggests, he would signal that he was a buyer at his proposed price but a seller at a penny more. That would constitute a guarantee that he was not trying to buy Alliance Boots on the cheap. It would also head off any suggestion that Mr Pessina was obstructing an auction by teaming up exclusively with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US buy-out firm. After all, his stake would be available to other buyers.The snag is that Alliance Boots’ shareholders might not be grateful for this gesture of sincerity. Restrictions on any bidder remove a source of tension in an auction. Shareholders would surely want Mr Pessina to participate in a raised offer if he got the value of the business wrong in the first place, or if the company unexpectedly started to perform better – or if he decided he was happy to overpay.So Mr Myners’ principle looks only half-right in this situation. A one-off final offer from Mr Pessina ought not to be welcomed by Alliance Boots. All the same, Mr Pessina should still seek to demonstrate that he will not stand in the way of an auction. If he makes a formal offer with KKR, he should say he would be prepared to sell his stake to counterbidders. He should also be open to teaming up with other private equity firms.Mr Pessina and KKR may still end up tabling the only formal offer. So whatever they come up with next, Sir Nigel Rudd, Alliance Boots’ chairman, must be ready to respond by showing how his board would generate competing value as a public company.Capital punishmentTim Breedon, chief executive of Legal & General, talks of capital as the “raw material” of life insurance. If the cost of that raw material comes down – if the insurer is required to hold less capital by the regulator, for instance, or finds sound ways to reduce its cushion of reserves – L&G, like any business, has to consider how to respond. It could reinvest, pass on the saving to customers in lower prices, or pay it to shareholders as higher dividends or buy-backs.By tailoring itself to new regulatory requirements, which permit insurers to hold lower capital reserves against term assurance and toning up its balance sheet, L&G is readying itself for the latter course.It’s a complex and slow process, but any annoyance among investors about the pace of progress is misplaced. Speed is not always a virtue in this sector. Tuesday’s annual results were never intended to mark the end of the capital review – if only because the regulator and the taxman must sign off before L&G can make its final decision, scheduled for July.Could L&G go further and release much more than the £1bn-£1.5bn that the market expects? Technically, yes, but only if it sacrificed its AA credit rating. That would be a step too far for a group that considers financial strength, correctly calibrated for the market and regulatory conditions, is a competitive advantage – particularly when it now finds itself pitching for pension trustees’ custom against comparative newcomers.The form of the capital return seems most likely to be a combination of buy-backs and a stepped-up dividend and will be based on L&G’s soundings of “where the least number of investors would not want us to be”. Again: don’t rush the company – patient holders of the shares, trading at an attractive 1.2 times end-2006 embedded value, will be rewarded.Investment driversThe sale of NCP to Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund shows that protests by the GMB union are not enough to stop the private equity juggernaut. After Thames Water, this is the second acquisition by Macquarie in six months of an asset with a high public profile. The leveraged deal is courting trouble. Some of the car park group’s staff demonstrated against 3i, its existing private equity owners, last month. Strikes are planned. Maybe Macquarie felt comfortable going ahead because NCP’s headcount grew under 3i’s ownership. That makes it a potentially good PR story for private equity. But a better explanation is that the industry is hungry to put capital to work and has a thick skin.L&G: andrew.hill@ft.comchris.hughes@ft.comwww.ft.com/lombard
512;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

Its shares improved 1.5 per cent to 254p in trading volume three times the daily average amid talk it could be the next retailer to receive a bid from a private equity house.After the recent takeover approaches for J Sainsbury, up 1.7 per cent to 530p, and Alliance Boots, 0.6 per cent weaker at £10.11½p, traders said the rumours had been taken seriously and spooked short sellers into buying back their positions.Kingfisher, which has property portfolio worth an estimated £3bn, is among the most heavily “shorted” stocks in the FTSE 100, with about 12 per cent of its issued share capital on loan.Analysts pointed out Kingfisher shares had also been lifted by news of strong post Christmas sales at Home Retail Group, the owner of the Argos and Homebase chains.Indeed, it was those figures that were behind the strength in DSG International, up 1.8 per cent to 169p. Home Retail shares rose 0.4 per cent to 423¾p.Elsewhere in the sector, Next spent most of the day in positive territory after Deutsche Bank increased its target price to £24.50 and advised clients to “buy” ahead of the clothing retailer’s trading statement next Thursday.“Whilst the update is likely to reveal that like-for-like-sales are still negative, we believe they will be much improved from the last reported minus 7 per cent and will turn positive later this year,” the broker said.However, Next came to rest 0.4 per cent cheaper at £20.15 amid talk an investment bank had taken on a block of 4.5m shares and had been unable to place themIn the wider market, leading shares took another pounding. Rocked by a sell-off in Asia and further losses on Wall Street Wednesday, the FTSE 100 ended down 160.5 points, or 2.6 per cent, at 6,000.7 – its third consecutive day of losses and its lowest finish since October 2006.Traders noted that the index had dipped below its 200-day moving average for the first time since last September. Since the start of the week, the blue chip index has lost 244.5 points, or 3.9 per cent.Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 tumbled 316.8 points, or 2.9 per cent, to 10,944.1.Market turnover was strong, with more than 4bn shares changing hands.Financial stocks were among Wednesday’s biggest fallers. Barclays lost 4.6 per cent to 673½p while Royal Bank of Scotland dropped 4.5 per cent to £19.55 on worries they could be affected by the problems in the US subprime mortgage market.HBOS was also under pressure, falling 5.7 per cent to £10.17p, although its shares were also trading ex-dividend. Private equity group 3i, down 5.4 per cent to £10.75½p, and hedge fund manager Man Group, off 4 per cent at 492½p, were also hard hit.Weakness in commodities and general profit taking weighed on the mining sector where Antofagasta shed 4.5 per cent to 448p and Lonmin surrendered 4 per cent to £28.33.But Cadbury Schweppes managed to finish unchanged at 602p. UBS said it expected Nelson Peltz, the US activist investor, to increase his 3 per cent stake in the soft drinks and confectionery group and then push for boardroom representation as he did at H.J. Heinz.PartyGaming was the stand-out feature in the FTSE 250. The online poker company shot up 12.5 per cent to 42¾p on massive volume of 383m shares after Barney Frank, the Democratic chairman of the House financial services committee, revealed on FT.com that he working on legislation to repeal the bill that was passed in Congress last year that effectively banned online gaming.Restaurant Group was also in demand, rising 5.7 per cent to 350p.The company is rumoured to be a takeover target for a private equity group but traders pinned Wednesday’s move on an upgrade from Morgan Stanley.Moving to an “overweight” recommendation and setting a 400p target price, the broker said the new Blubeckers format had the potential to be as big as the Frankie & Benny’s chain and that Restaurant Group could afford to buy back 85m shares.British Energy, off 0.2 per cent at 432 ¾p, avoided the worst of Wednesday’s selling after Cazenove drew attention to the recent increase in wholesale power prices in the UK.
514;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-14T19:17:35Z;Poll offers three ways of halting GdF’s wedding;;"Jean-François Cirelli keeps insisting that the best option for Gaz de France remains its proposed marriage with Suez. The GdF chief executive said so again this week, unveiling an impressive set of results for 2006 with the additional fillip of a 62 per cent dividend increase. Yet even Mr Cirelli must concede that the chances of pulling off the merger are pretty slim, if not downright non-existent. Gérard Mestrallet, his opposite number at Suez, has already had to admit as much by plotting an alternative future for his Franco-Belgian utility.The fate of the state-controlled gas utility now rests on the outcome of the French presidential election. The three frontrunners all have different agendas for GdF, but they share one thing in common: they do not like the Suez-GdF merger concocted by the outgoing government. Nicolas Sarkozy, the rightwing candidate, would prefer to see GdF strike a deal with a big gas supplier such as Algeria’s Sonatrach.Ségolène Royal, the Socialist candidate, is dead set against the Suez-GdF marriage and is keen to create a state-owned energy behemoth by combining GdF with EDF, the electricity utility, on the German model of Eon-Ruhrgaz.François Bayrou, the centrist candidate making forceful headway in the polls, opposes any privatisation of GdF and believes the utility can prosper on a stand-alone basis.Under the circumstances, there is a ring of tragedy in GdF’s predicament. The GdF chorus is being forced by a lame duck government to maintain the illusion of a marriage with Suez, while the company’s future will ultimately be decided by politics.Reverse gearBack-to-the-future strategies seem to have become all the rage among German carmakers. Leading the pack is Volkswagen. A presentation of its “new” strategy last week felt like a rolling back of the clock by a decade. Its focus on volumes with an emphasis on technology and quality – not a word about profitability and affordable cars – is a throwback to the days of Ferdinand Piëch as chief executive.Little wonder that so many consider Mr Piëch, now the chairman, as the power behind the new boss, Martin Winterkorn. The cost-cutting era seems over at VW, a mass-market producer in the wrong place – western Europe. With Renault and Peugeot-Citroën – to say nothing of Toyota and Hyundai – seeking to increase sales too, something must give. Yet most other German carmakers are following suit. Audi wants to boost sales by 50 per cent to 1.5m by 2015. BMW is set to achieve its sales target of 1.4m cars this year, which it aims to boost to 1.6m by 2010. Such growth, however, comes at a price. In the US, BMW incentives, meaning discounts, have already reached a mouth-watering $4,000 a car.One German rival warns: “Incentives are like a hard drug – it is very difficult to wean yourself off them.” Therein lies the danger of a volume strategy – encouraging companies to take whatever steps necessary to defend their positions even at the cost of profitability.It is thus hardly surprising that the world’s most profitable carmaker, Porsche, continues to shun incentives. As a result it suffered months of falling sales as its Cayenne SUV came to the end of its life cycle because it refused to dump them on the market. Porsche says its sales will grow only lightly until a new model is introduced in 2009. Other carmakers should take note. richard.milne@ft.comPolish inquisitionAny Communist spies who have squirreled themselves on to the boards of Polish companies or foreign companies heavily involved in Poland should be nervous at the latest legal twist from Warsaw. Everyone else can shrug about the government’s priorities and go back to work in one of Europe’s fastest-growing economies.A new law that goes into effect today demands that lawyers, politicians, journalists, professors and board members or managers of any companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange certify whether or not they were informants for Communist-era secret police. Those who do not do so in time lose their posts and face a decade-long ban from public functions.The Warsaw exchange lists 13 foreign companies – from regional heavyweights such as the Czech Republic’s CEZ energy group to minnows such as Astarta, a Ukrainian sugar company – and other foreigners are on the boards of local companies.The reaction from most foreign companies is bemusement, but no one has any intention of pulling out of Warsaw, the region’s largest capital market. The country’s image has taken a beating over more important issues, such as the slugging match between the government and Eureko, the Dutch insurance group, over the botched privatisation of PZU, the state-owned insurer. Warsaw’s credentials have hardly been helped by the deputy treasury minister’s comments this week that Poland may not abide by the outcome of international arbitration in the PZU case. That should make investors much more concerned than any hunt for ageing Communist spies. jan.cienski@ft.comBenQ share slideBenQ is now fast approaching the class the Taiwanese call “dumpling stocks”. Yesterday, the electronics maker’s shares fell by the daily limit of 7 per cent to T$13.05 on news that prosecutors are targeting it in an insider trading probe.Although such investigations are common in Taiwan and often fail to result in convictions, the probe adds momentum to the company’s seemingly unstoppable downward slide. BenQ’s planned restructuring might be the last chance.After the company, formerly Acer’s computer peripherals affiliate, started building its own brand, euphoria ran high, driving shares to a peak of T$80 in 2002. BenQ won one design award after another and gained brand recognition.But the new prominence eroded its contract manufacturing business, resulting in a loss of its two major mobile phone customers, Nokia and Motorola by 2005. That was when chairman Lee Kun-yao sought a quantum leap through the acquisition of the handset arm of Siemens.The gamble failed, leaving BenQ with a damaged brand image, a dwindling share of the handset market, depleted cash reserves, and still without a convincing strategy.The company will spin off contract manufacturing operations this year to end the conflict of interest with its brand business. But after the latest blow, Mr Lee will have an even harder time to convince investors that the turnround will work.
Kathrin Hille: khille888@aol.comBuy-out clarityAlliance Boots’ shareholders are worried that Stefano Pessina is underpricing his proposed £9.7bn ($18.7bn) management buy-out for the retail and wholesale pharmacist, where he is deputy chairman.How can Mr Pessina prove that, if he makes a formal offer, it reflects his assessment of the company’s full value? One elegant solution was floated in a lecture on management buy-outs this week by Paul Myners, former chairman of Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer.Mr Myners suggests that whenever managers want to buy a company in which they own a big stake, they should make a “final” offer and agree to sell their shares to any higher counterbid that subsequently emerges. Adopting this principle would address the conflicts in the Alliance Boots situation. If Mr Pessina structured a bid along these lines, it would signal that he was a buyer at his proposed price, but a seller at a penny more.That would constitute a guarantee that he was not knowingly buying Alliance Boots on the cheap. It would also partially absolve Mr Pessina of the charge that he was obstructing an auction by teaming up with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US buy-out firm. His stake would be available to any other buyer. The snag is that Alliance Boots’ shareholders would perhaps not be too grateful for the gesture.Restrictions on any bidder remove a possible source of tension in an auction. Mr Pessina might have got the value of the business wrong. Or he might be willing to overpay slightly for the business if a rival bidder emerged. Or the value of the business might suddenly increase for unexpected reasons.So Mr Myners’ principle is probably only half-right in this situation. The bottom line is that Mr Pessina needs to convince investors that he is not obstructing a competitive auction for Alliance Boots. Rather than declare his offer final, it may be better for him to say that he would sell his stake to higher bidders, while also making himself available to management buy-outs backed by other private equity firms. chris.hughes@ft.comeuropean.view@ft.comworld.view@ft.com"
515;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-13T22:52:10Z;Merrill Lynch quits as broker to Boots;;Merrill Lynch has stepped down as broker to Alliance Boots to work as an adviser to Stefano Pessina and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts after their £9.7bn offer for the retail and drugs wholesaler was rebuffed on Monday.The highly unusual move will add to expectations that the consortium is planning to raise its offer after its indicative approach, worth £10 per share, was rejected by the Alliance Boots board.Mr Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance Boots and its largest shareholder, is thought to have asked the board on Monday to release Merrill, one of the company’s three corporate brokers, for the bid.Mr Pessina has a close relationship with Merrill. It was his adviser on Alliance Unichem’s £7.8bn merger with Boots last year. The move will raise eyebrows in the City, where corporate brokers often present themselves as a company’s closest and most trusted advisers.However, this has not stopped investment banks from switching sides. In 2003, Credit Suisse was heavily criticised after it resigned as broker to Safeway to work for KKR on a bid for the supermarket group.However, people involved in the deal on Tuesday night stressed that Merrill’s decision was different because Mr Pessina had asked for it be released.UBS and Credit Suisse will continue to act as brokers to Alliance Boots, which has also retained Goldman Sachs as its financial adviser. If Mr Pessina’s offer is successful, Merrill is likely to earn a larger fee than it would have received as joint broker.Rivals said Merrill’s move reflected the complexities of Mr Pessina’s position. “Normally once you’ve said you’re the company’s broker that’s it – come hell or high water,” one banker said. “But you have to ask: is it contrary to the company’s interests for Merrill to be released?”The Merrill appointment comes at a critical time in the unfolding bid saga surrounding the company formed seven months ago.It is thought that the KKR side is sitting back a little to allow for a “cooling-off period” following its rejection. People close to the consortium insisted that £10 a share was a “fullish” price. “There is no hidden pot of gold [in Alliance Boots].”One source suggested that the consortium may not come back with a second offer until after Alliance Boots’ pre-close trading update on March 28.Some of Alliance Boots’ largest long-term shareholders on Tuesday began to voice their concerns about the deal and the inherent conflicts of interest. “If there is something Pessina wants to do he should do it as a public company,” one investor said.Boots shares continued to rise on Tuesday, closing 20.5p higher at £10.17½.
516;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-13T20:19:23Z;Peltz does not need a board seat to kick Cadbury;;"Activist’s presence alone will have impactNelson Peltz’s purchase of a 3 per cent stake in Cadbury Schweppes has almost certainly made a takeover less likely. But the sweet-toothed activist’s raid on the confectionery and beverage company has still opened Pandora’s chocolate box.As JPMorgan pointed out on Monday, Cadbury’s shares, even before yesterday’s 10 per cent rise, were trading above the level at which leveraged buy-out artists would get a decent return on their investment. Judging from events at HJ Heinz over the past year, Cadbury is more likely to face a steady increase in pressure for a more aggressive strategy, coupled with an attempt by Mr Peltz to win seats on the board.At the US foodmaker, the activist built a 5 per cent stake – enough to push the shares up 10 per cent without his having to move a muscle. Mr Peltz eventually proposed efficiency improvements, the sale of non-core businesses, increased marketing of the ketchup brand and more buy-backs to tone up the balance sheet, winning directorships for himself and an associate.Cadbury looks a little different. Share price performance has been choppy over the past year, partly due to mishaps and mis-steps in the UK, but stronger over the period since Todd Stitzer’s appointment as chief executive in 2003 than Heinz was in the two years before Mr Peltz’s intervention. Some believe that splitting the global confectionery and the drinks business (part of which, Snapple, Mr Nelson knows well, as he sold it to Cadbury seven years ago) could realise hidden value. But again, it is difficult to see a break-up earning investors more than the current share price.That leaves the boardroom. Getting an election organised would be easier under UK rules, provided Mr Peltz could rally another 7 per cent of shares for an extraordinary meeting. At Heinz, the shares have risen by a quarter since his appearance, governance has improved and strategy is tighter. Tempting. But Mr Peltz should be able to give Mr Stitzer a decent kick along the path to growth without shareholders having to elect him to the board.Subprime, sub-optimalFrank Bascombe, the realtor-narrator of Independence Day, Richard Ford’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, describes falling property values as “an odorless, colorless mist settling through the still air where all breathe it in”. Does the plight of New Century Financial, the US subprime lender on the verge of bankruptcy, suggest those noxious fumes are going to drift across the Atlantic to the UK?In one respect, they are already here, imported by HSBC, which has warned it could take between two and three years to solve the problems caused by its own exposure to the US subprime market.The message from UK banks about their home market is more reassuring. The loans are less risky, the ratio of the loan to the property’s value being rarely as high as in the US, where it often reaches 100 per cent; the subprime market is differently defined (it includes the more secure “near-prime” category); and, critically, British house prices are still rising, so householders stretched on other fronts can raise money against the value of their property.Far from fleeing dodgy borrowers, many UK retail banks are still running towards them, as are investment banks, attracted by the opportunity to securitise such loans. Don’t fret too much, was the message from Lehman Brothers yesterday; it would take a combination of at least two out of three adverse factors – lower property price appreciation, more “flexible” loans and higher interest rates – to shake the UK asset-backed securities market.Lehman still sounded cautious about credit quality over the coming year. And well it should. According to Robert Shiller, bearish US economist and author of Irrational Exuberance, these are precisely the circumstances in which loan officers, “calculating their own personal career advantage in bringing in more business today”, can fall prone to “over-speculation”. Circumstances may be different in the UK, but it would do no harm for British lenders and investors to inhale a small draft of the miasma of fear hanging over the US.Festival of conflictsDid Alliance Unichem and Boots ever really merge, or were the companies and their advisers just slammed together under a new logo? The bid for Alliance Boots seems to provoke such questions daily.Merrill Lynch has now stepped down as broker to the target to work for Stefano Pessina, whose relationship with the US bank dated back to before the Boots deal. OK, so Mr Pessina asked the Alliance Boots’ board’s permission and Merrill only switched sides when it was granted. But it will be another nail in the coffin of City broking if from now on corporate clients have to ask banks to state in advance which of the company, its directors and its major shareholders they will select as their client, when push comes to shove."

Cazenove estimates the company draws about 28 per cent of its underlying earnings from new house sales in the US.Worries over the strength of the US housing market gathered pace Tuesday following news that mortgage delinquencies had risen to a three-year high in the fourth quarter of last year and weak US retail sales data.Indeed, it was those two factors that were behind the weakness of the wider market. The FTSE 100 closed 72.1 points, or 1.1 per cent, lower at 6,161.2, with just four stocks managing to crawl into positive territory.One of those was Cadbury Schweppes, which jumped 10.5 per cent to 602p after the soft drinks and chocolate company confirmed Nelson Peltz, the US activist investor, had built a near 3 per cent stake.With 125m Cadbury shares changing hands Tuesday, traders believed Mr Peltz could have well have added to his holding.Another stock to buck the weak trend was Alliance Boots, which climbed 2.1 per cent to £10.17½ as traders bet Stefano Pessina, deputy executive chairman, and private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts would return with a higher bid.That speculation, however, weighed on J Sainsbury, down a further 2.2 per cent to 521p. Traders are concerned KKR, which is part of the private equity consortium considering a bid for Sainsbury, will not be able to pursue both bids.Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 fell 157.1 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 11,260.9 with HMV Group, down 15.9 per cent at 128½p, the biggest faller after the music and book retailer issued another profits warning.Market turnover was a below-average 2.9bn shares. Traders blamed the weak volumes on the start of the Cheltenham racing festival.Brewing company SABMiller carried the FTSE 100 lower. Its shares shed 4.4 per cent to £10.85 after its licence to produce and distribute Amstel larger in South Africa was revoked by Heineken.Housebuilder Persimmon was also under pressure, falling 2.8 per cent to £13.64 after a survey showed UK house prices had risen at their slowest pace in nine months during February. That news also weighed on Redrow, off 5.3 per cent to 586p.ICI, the speciality chemicals company, surrendered early gains to close 0.4 per cent cheaper at 487¾p. The retreat was triggered by rumours that Dutch rival Akzo Nobel was looking to spend the €11bn (£7.5bn) it will pocket from the sale of its drug business on a bid for Swiss group Clariant and not ICI.Kingfisher, the DIY retailer, fell 1.4 per cent to 250¼p in spite rumours of further deals to release value from its property portfolio.Among the mid caps, insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson was one of the main talking points after its shares rose 4.7 per cent to 459¾p on rumours that it could make another approach for rival Heath Lambert.There was also a speculative buzz around Rentokil Initial. Speculation of interest from a private equity group saw its shares firm up 0.2 per cent to 151½p.Engineer Bodycote International was marked 2.1 per cent higher at 323p on talk that Swiss predator Sulzer would return with another offer.Sulzer on Tuesday suspended its share buyback programme and said it would seek shareholder approval for a 20 per cent capital increase. Bodycote has knocked back three offers from Sulzer, the last of which was pitched at 325p a share.SIG, the insulation building materials supplier which reports full-year results today, gained 0.8 per cent to £11.63 on the view that it could be one of biggest beneficiaries of the government’s proposed Climate Change Bill.Broker Cazenove said insulation upgrades would have a key role to play if the government is meet its target of a 60 per cent cut in carbon emissions.Wood Group rose 3.5 per cent to 296½p on the back of a strong trading update from small-cap rival Sondex, up 3.2 per cent to 355p.
518;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-12T21:17:55Z;Boots to hold out for higher offer price;;Nigel Rudd, chairman of Alliance Boots, showed his muscle on Monday as he rejected a £9.7bn bid approach from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity powerhouse, and Stefano Pessina, his executive deputy chairman, saying that the £10 a share offer was too low to get the chemist chain to open its books.In a statement, the company said: “The board does not believe it [the offer] reflects the fundamental value of the company or the attractive prospects, opportunities and synergies available to Alliance Boots following the very recent completion of its merger.”Mr Pessina, the biggest shareholder with a 15 per cent stake, and his long-term partner and board member Ornella Barra were not present at the meeting.Mr Pessina’s approach raised some eyebrows in the City given that the Italian-born billionaire had only just got his feet under the table in the enlarged group.Sir Nigel’s rebuttal comes after a weekend of speculation suggesting that the chairman would find it hard to rebuff Mr Pessina, given that the executive deputy chairman is a key shareholder and the man behind Alliance Boots’ growth strategy. However, sources close to Boots’s chairman pointed out that Sir Nigel is a tough negotiator, who rejected two approaches for Pilkington from Nippon Sheet Glass before finally accepting the £2.2bn offer last year.Sir Nigel has explicitly told Richard Baker, chief executive, that he must not discuss the bid with Mr Pessina, who wants to keep the current management team on board.Despite attempts to isolate Mr Pessina from the rest of the board and its advisers, Sir Nigel is faced with a delicate and complex situation. Mr Pessina is Alliance Boots’ linchpin. It was he who drove through the Boots-Alliance UniChem tie up last year and he who runs group strategy.Mr Pessina is also the company’s biggest shareholder and is well-represented on the board, given that three of the six non-executives come from the Pessina camp. In addition to this, his desire to keep the current management team on board should garner support in the executive team.KKR and Mr Pessina will now be mulling whether to come back with a higher offer.Boots shares, which jumped 14 per cent on Friday before the takeover approach was announced, hit their highest level since the merger last August hitting £10.05 before closing up 7.2 per cent or 56½p at 997p, valuing the group at about £9.7bn.The company, which was formed through a £7.8bn merger of Alliance UniChem and Boots last August, had underperformed the food and drug retail sector by 5 per cent this year.Additional reporting by Peter Thal Larsen
519;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-12T20:33:31Z;Alliance Boots and conflicts of interest;;“So we’ve received a takeover bid? Ah. I was wondering why the shares were up so sharply, given the absence of new public information. Well, convene the board. What? The bid is from senior executive director Stefano Pessina, backed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts? Convene the board without him! Yes. Tricky. Perhaps we should exclude all the executive directors: after all a majority of them, including Mr Pessina’s partner, used to work for his previous company. Let’s just convene the non-executive directors. Sorry, I forgot: three of the six non-execs used to be directors of Mr Pessina’s previous company. Let’s give the shareholders a ring . . . although not of course our largest shareholder, Mr Pessina. And I need some decent advice: call the bankers. Goodness! They’re acting for KKR and partners in a bid for our fellow retailer J Sainsbury? Well, then at least get our public relations people for me. You’re joking. They act for KKR too?”Monday’s decision by Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Alliance Boots, to reject the £10 per share offer may have been the only rational response to his invidious position. The difficulties with advisers can probably be resolved. The PR firm has already dropped KKR. Meeting requirements under the Takeover Code, a second bank has been identified that does not have conflicts with KKR – no mean feat in itself.The full board, excluding Mr Pessina and his partner, convened on Monday. Arguably only six out of 13 members are genuinely independent, but this principle may be worth compromising – applying a strict test would rob the decision-makers of the views of the finance director and two out of three divisional directors as well as Mr Pessina, who is in charge of strategy and integrating last year’s merger. Out of necessity, Sir Nigel has allowed a group of individuals of questionable independence to evaluate the approach. If Mr Pessina and KKR return with a higher offer, this trade-off will face yet more scrutiny.
520;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-12T20:10:32Z;Bulls victorious in battle over Cadbury;;A two-way pull developed in Cadbury Schweppes Monday with the bulls eventually emerging triumphant.Cadbury spent most of the session in the doldrums after JPMorgan advised clients to avoid the soft drinks and confectionery group on the grounds that a leveraged buy-out was unlikely.Private equity takeover rumours have been one of the main factors that have helped support the Cadbury share price in the past year.However, late in the day Cadbury rallied, closing 0.9 per cent higher at 545p on rumours that an activist investor had started building a stake.One name in the frame was Nelson Peltz, the US financier who amassed a 5.5 per cent stake in Heinz last year.Although treating the rumours with caution, traders pointed out that Mr Peltz knows Cadbury well, having sold Snapple, a fruit juice business, to the company for $1.45bn in 2000.In the wider market, the FTSE 100 faded after a bright start, finishing 11.9 points, or 0.2 per cent, lower at 6,233.3. It was weighed down by profit taking in the retail sector and weakness in the banking sector, which was prompted by further problems in the US subprime mortgage market.The FTSE 250 firmed up 7.4 points to 11,418.Alliance Boots was Monday’s stand out feature. Its shares advanced 7.1 per cent to 996½p even though the company rejected a £10 a share offer from Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity group.Traders said the view in the market was that Mr Pessina, a 15 per cent shareholder, and KKR would return with a higher offer.Developments at Boots had an adverse effect on J Sainsbury, which fell 2.1 per cent to 532½p on concerns KKR might not have the firepower to pursue bids for both companies. KKR is a part of the consortium weighing up a bid for Sainsbury.ICI was 5.4 per cent higher at 489½p after Dutch rival Akzo Nobel announced the sale of its drug business for €11bn.Analysts said Akzo, which had previously been looking to float 30 per cent of Organon Biosciences, now had a warchest and could launch a bid for ICI.“Akzo’s cash disposal of pharma makes a bid for ICI more likely – we now assume a 50 per cent chance, up from 25 per cent,” James Knight at Collins Stewart said, adding that Akzo could pay up to 600p a share for ICI.News that Merrill Lynch has set a £30.50 price target helped shares in mining company Anglo American advance 1.7 per cent to £25.09. The broker said it expected Cynthia Carroll, Anglo’s new chief executive, to lay out her plans for unlocking value in the Anglo portfolio in coming months.In addition to demerging Anglo’s paper business Mondi and selling its stake in AngloGold, Merrill thinks Tarmac could also be divested, a move that could raise $6bn-$8bn.It also estimated that operational improvements could yield a $1.2bn increase in underlying profits.Cable & Wireless improved 0.9 per cent to 169p as Cazenove eased concerns about tough trading in the UK. These had been triggered by mid-cap rival Colt Telecom, up 4.5 per cent to 174¼p, which has warned of a sharp decline in voice revenues in the UK and Germany.“C&W has stressed its UK performance remains on track and appears somewhat bemused regarding Colt’s commentary,” the broker said in a note, following a conversation with C&W.“C&W continues to win new contracts, not necessarily on price, and suggests gross margins on voice have improved by over 100 basis points in recent months,” Cazenove added.Legal & General held firm at 155p supported by talk that the insurer could announce plans for a share buyback with tomorrow’s annual results.Among the mid-caps, engineering and pneumatics group IMI added 4.2 per cent to 558½p after Goldman Sachs flagged up the possibility that its drinks dispensing business could be sold.“We believe that following the recent management change the division will either see a ‘turnaround’ or be disposed of [either in whole or at least part,” it said.Collins Stewart rose 2.6 per cent to 239p after full-year results impressed and the stockbroker talked of a strong transactions pipeline.Construction group Balfour Beatty fell 4.6 per cent to 460¼p after Morgan Stanley placed 4.5m shares for a client.
521;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Boots chief prepared for tough talking;;"Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Alliance Boots, will need to be both tough in the boardroom and a stubborn defender of the company’s value if all his shareholders are to enjoy a fair deal from any management buyout.He is certainly a robust character. But his credentials in maximising shareholder value when companies are sold in an auction are less clear cut.Alliance Boots has already rejected the proposed £9.7bn offer by KKR as too low. The private equity group may yet come back with a raised offer. Alternatively, while Alliance Boots’ shares remain just below the proposed offer price, KKR may even go hostile.Sir Nigel’s next task must be to form a committee of entirely independent members of Alliance Boots’ board who can adjudicate on the value of any raised offer. That means excluding those who might have a financial interest in the company following any sale.He has already made the obvious exclusion of Stefano Pessina, the executive deputy chairman who owns 15 per cent of the stock and is leading the proposed buy-out in partnership with KKR.
He has also excluded Mr Pessina’s long-term partner, Ornella Barra.The snag is that Mr Pessina wants to rope in other members of the executive management. Depending on who Mr Pessina gets on board, Sir Nigel may be left with a committee entirely of non-executives.This would present two challenges. First, they would have a reduced ability to assess the value of the business because they are not involved in day-to-day management. Secondly, a number of the non-executives came from Alliance Unichem, which merged with Boots last year.Sir Nigel will have to ask himself whether they will
be accepted by shareholders as being genuinely inde­pendent.“It was a clumsily constructed board in the first place, which makes it harder to manage this situation,” says one banker.That said, Sir Nigel is no shrinking violet. He has a reputation for chomping through chief executives. He was on the board that showed the door to Martin Taylor, the chief executive of Barclays, in 1998.He also drove the replacement of Steve Russell, the former chief executive of Boots, with Richard Baker.“He is a red meat-eating capitalist. Absolutely he’s up to the job. His instincts are going to be right,” says one leading City fund manager. “You wouldn’t want to argue against him in the boardroom,” says another.The depth of Sir Nigel’s deal-making skills will be tested, however. He may be a mergers and acquisitions veteran, but his experience of handling “public-to-privates” is limited.His experience rests largely on the sale of Pilkington, the glassmaker sold to Japan’s Nippon Sheet Glass last year.There are some similarities with the Alliance Boots situation, in that NSG was already a large shareholder in the business, owning 20 per cent. Sir Nigel and the board rejected an initial 150p-a-share offer in November 2005 but then accepted a bid pitched at just 165p two months later. There was no auction.“Has he gone through 15 public-to-privates before? No, he’s not. But take-privates are especially difficult at the moment. We are all learning about them,” says one veteran investment banker. “He is as well-qualified a board practioner as there is. If I were a shareholder in Boots I couldn’t think of anyone better for the challenge.”Stimulating an auction might be especially hard. Mr Pessina’s link with KKR makes another private equity play tricky, while competition issues could deter others.Analysts say a tie-up with Celesio, the second-largest wholesale drugs distributor in Europe, would be near impossible on competition grounds.Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies have reacted sceptically to suggestions that they might buy part or all of Alliance Boots.Some medicine groups have withdrawn entirely from non-prescription consumer products. Others – GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson – have been active in purchasing ”over-the-counter” businesses in recent years. But that is of little use in this situation. Boots sold its medicine arm to Reckitt Benckiser in 2005.It is also hard to see why another private equity firm would weigh in. There is little freehold property to sell to help finance a deal.Alliance Boots’ freehold stores could be worth about £1.5bn – double its net book value of £750m – according to RBC Capital Markets,
the boutique headed by
John Ralfe, a former Boots executiveAgainst that backdrop, Sir Nigel might have to rely on shareholder support – possibly attracting a dogged hedge fund onto the register if he does not feel any future offer cuts the mustard.Additonal reporting by Jim Pickard and Andrew Jack"

523;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-12T19:49:50Z;Alliance Boots reignites the war on buy-out firms;;"It may be a good deal but it is terrible PRWhatever its merits for Alliance Boots’ investors, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’ backing for a buy-out of the UK wholesale and retail pharmacist must have elicited a groan from private equity’s new lobbyists – and from KKR’s partners in the planned consortium bid for J Sainsbury, another icon of the high street.The industry has only just started to allay misplaced concerns whipped up by the proposed Sainsbury offer. Private equity firms have agreed to construct a new voluntary code of conduct on disclosure; the government has reined in those senior ministers that were leading the charge against buy-outs; and last week Ed Balls, the City minister, announced a review of tax relief that looks just enough to satisfy the critics of private equity, without risking undue punishment of the industry as a whole. Now, at a stroke, KKR has thrust itself and its peers in the Sainsbury bidding consortium back into the public eye. The GMB union that spearheads the campaign against aggressive private equity ownership must be rubbing its hands.KKR might argue that it would have made no sense for it to turn down the Alliance Boots opportunity, only to see a competitor reap the rewards of taking the group private. But the firm’s former barbarians also know they must increasingly protect their reputation worldwide. It was KKR that complained to the French regulator last November that its name was being linked to false takeover rumours, for instance. Sometimes, too, short-term restraint is the only way of guaranteeing continued longer-term success, as Goldman Sachs – which is adviser to Alliance Boots and backer of the consortium’s planned takeover of Sainsbury – knows well.There is no doubting the positive overall impact of private equity on the economy. But, as Doug Lowenstein, new chief US lobbyist for the buy-out firms, told the Financial Times this week, it must be a priority for the industry “to avoid a situation where private equity becomes a political punching bag.”By plunging into another high-profile bid in the UK, KKR has just invited its antagonists to put their gloves back on.S&N: a prognosisMr Smith? Mr Smith – can you hear me? Hearing aid on? Excellent.I’m your consultant orthopaedic surgeon. How are you feeling? Great, that’s great.I wanted to see you and Mrs Nephew just as soon as you came out from under the anaesthetic to tell you that the operation went very well. A complete success.There’s just one thing: it’s not the operation you came in for. No. Well, Mr Smith, you remember that you requested a Biomet – the big transatlantic option? We would have grafted one huge sales force onto the other and you’d have been leaping around the day-room with the big boys like Stryker, Zimmer and Johnson & Johnson before you could say “cementless total hip arthroplasty”!No, Mr Smith – don’t get agitated, you’ll dislodge the stitches – nothing “went wrong”. As you know, orthopaedics like the rest of the health service is a market these days and I’m afraid a private patient outbid you for that particular operation. Yes – you’re right, going private is “all the rage” these days.But I think you and Mrs Nephew will be very pleased with the alternative outcome. We’ve got you a splendid new acquisition – Plus Orthopedics. It’s Swiss – beautifully engineered, as you’d expect from the clock people. And the really great news is there’s no chance of rejection, it’s cost you less than a tenth of what you might have paid for a Biomet, it works all over Europe and, with margins as healthy as yours, you’ll be able to count on a better all-round performance from next year.What’s that Mrs Nephew? Will your husband be totally independent from now on? With a Biomet, Mr Smith, you’d certainly have had the strength and scale to soldier on for years. We’ve now got you on an intensive therapy of buybacks and bolt-ons and that will do the trick for the time being. But, of course, you can’t get by on your own for ever. You know what they say, Mr Smith: everybody has his time! Ha ha!Mr Smith? Don’t be childish – turn the hearing aid back on! Mr Smith!Well-articulatedMotivating people is at the core of management, but it is rare to find a way of expressing the idea that steers clear of the swamp of consultant-led cliché. Andrew Tinkler, chairman of Eddie Stobart, has found one. He and managing director William Stobart, bent on reviving the legendary trucking company, realised drivers were fed up with having to share lorries – a haulage version of “hot-desking”. They decided to reward top performers by giving them the keys to take home. A simple solution, with a simple slogan – “one man, one truck” – that carries more weight than a whole lorryload of management-speak about employee “empowerment” and “ownership”."
524;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-12T16:32:07Z;Sir Nigel Rudd does right;;The board of Alliance Boots has done the only thing it could sensibly do given the conflicts of interest of some of its members: it has rejected KKR’s £10 a share proposed offer as too low. The shares have risen just above that level this afternoon. With Stefano Pessina and his 15 per cent holding lined up behind KKR’s proposal and six others on the 13 strong board allied to Mr Pessina, this situation is a big test for chairman Sir Nigel Rudd. Pessina and KKR clearly see growth opportunities that other investors have missed, not just room for financial engineering or asset stripping, which is minimal at Boots. This alone is a good reason not to accept their first offer.The CDS market, meanwhile, is suggesting that the chances of a bid for J Sainsbury has receded now that KKR, which is part of the consortium stalking it, has honed in on Boots. Sainsbury shares are off about 2 per cent.Ford Motor has confirmed the sale of Aston Martin to a consortium of investors led by David Richards, a motor industry veteran, for close to £439m ($848m). The consortium also includes John Sinders( who has just given up being a banker at Jefferies but has gave them the business of advising the consortium) and two Kuwaiti-based financial firms. Our man, Jonathan Guthrie, dragged his battered Volvo estate to the press conference and will say more in tomorrow’s paper about the buyers and their plans.Monsoon has warned of difficult trading again. The company, which is losing both its chief executive and finance director this month, blamed “difficult” trading on the high street and glitches with a new distribution centre.Smith & Nephew, the UK medical device maker which has looked vulnerable to a bid since failing to buy Biomet last year, has agreed to buy Plus Orthopedics Holding, a privately-owned Swiss group, for SFr1.09bn ($889m) cash, including assumed debt.Pipex Communications has confirmed a story in this morning’s Independent, saying it has appointed UBS to consider various strategic options including a sale of the business.Today is another big results day. Broker Collins Stewart reported strong growth in profits and turnover in its first set of results after December’s demerger of Tullett Prebon, its inter-dealer broker business. Pro forma pre-tax profits were £64.8m, up from £46.6m, on revenue of £184.8m compared to £148.7m for the year to December 31.Bovis Homes has reported a 17 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits to £135.5m. No update on the takeover speculation which has lifted the stock in recent days.Other results include: Hiscox (good), Interserve (good, and past its accounting problem), Greggs (hit by mild winter and restructuring costs), Absolute Capital Management (good figures, welcomes recent market volatility) and Lookers (selling lots of Aston Martins and Range Rovers).Rumour of the day: ICI shares are up nearly 6 per cent this afternoon on news that Akzo Nobel has torn up plans to float its medicines business in favour of an €11bn sale to Schering-Plough. Investors, who have long seen ICI as a bid target, were betting that the Dutch chemicals maker would use the proceeds to bid for its UK rival. Akzo said it was looking at making acquisitions that made “strategic sense”.Make or read a commentAbout this blogSee previous blogs
525;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-11T22:06:53Z;Private equity slams ‘hostility’;;The head of the US’s first private equity lobby group has hit out at the “extremely low” understanding of the industry by policy­makers as the sector launches its first campaign to head off public criticism of its growing role in the economy.Douglas Lowenstein, a veteran lobbyist recently named by 10 of the largest buy-out groups to head the Private Equity Council, told the Financial Times the body would set out to prove that the industry’s deal-making benefits the whole economy.Mr Lowenstein, a former chief lobbyist for the video game industry, said the groups’ strategic priority was to avoid a repeat of the hostile reaction their multibillion-dollar take­overs prompted in Europe.In his first interview since taking the post, Mr Lowenstein said: “In parts of Europe, there is a lot more overt hostility from certain constituencies. One of the outcomes is to avoid a situation where private equity becomes a political punching bag.”Politicians and trade unions in Europe have accused private equity firms, which were last year branded “locusts” by Franz Müntefering, Germany’s deputy chancellor, of asset-stripping and savage cost-cutting at the companies they buy.The backlash recently spread to the UK, where private equity groups are targeting famous high street names such as the retailers J Sainsbury and Alliance Boots.In the US, opposition has been more muted despite a sharp increase in the size of the funds raised, and deals clinched, by buy-out groups.However, many in the industry fear that discontent with the large returns reaped by private equity funds and the fortunes amassed by its top executives could prompt politicians and regulators to take action.Mr Lowenstein said the council, whose members include Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone and Texas Pacific Group, would strive to fill the “knowledge gap” of Washington policymakers.“The level of understanding of private equity in policy circles is extremely low,” he said. “There is both a lack of understanding and a lack of knowledge and either of them is problematic from a public policy standpoint.”On policy matters, Mr Lowenstein said one of his first tasks would be to fight plans to increase taxes on the industry.He said the council would lobby specifically against efforts in the Senate Finance Committee to increase the tax rate on the “carried interest” – the gains made by private equity firms on deals. “Yes, there is a proposal . . . obviously we have a stake in that,” he said.The council is poised to commission research to back the industry’s claim that its deals help make companies leaner and more efficient and add value to the economy as a whole.However, Mr Lowenstein said the organisation would not lobby on individual deals, such as the $45bn bid by KKR and TPG for the Texas-based utility TXU.
526;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-11T22:06:07Z;Boots chief moves to isolate deputy;;Sir Nigel Rudd is working behind the scenes to reassure Alliance Boots shareholders that he will not give Stefano Pessina an easy ride in taking the high street giant private, after his deputy chairman said on Friday that he was making a £9.7bn bid for the company with the backing of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.People close to Alliance Boots’ chairman said on Sunday that Mr Pessina’s efforts to take the retailer and pan-European drugs distribution business private was “in no way a done deal”.Another said Alliance Boots, formed through a £7.8bn merger of Alliance UniChem and Boots last August, had been performing well in recent months and had “good prospects” as an independent, public company.The board’s non-executives were due to meet on Monday morning to discuss the approach, before holding a full board meeting later in the day to decide whether to open the books on the back of a £10 a share indicative offer. Mr Pessina will be excluded from the board meeting, as will Ornella Barra, his partner of 24 years who also sits on the board as the company’s wholesale and commercial director.In early trading on Monday, shares in Alliance Boots were up more than 7 per cent at 998p.Meanwhile, Sir Nigel has explicitly told Richard Baker, chief executive, that he must not discuss the bid with Mr Pessina, who wants to keep the current management team on board.Sir Nigel is also considering hiring a second banking adviser to work alongside advisers Goldman Sachs, given that the US investment bank also works closely with KKR. In recent weeks, Goldman has teamed up with KKR and other private equity houses in an effort to make an £11bn-plus bid for another FTSE 100 high street giant – J Sainsbury.Despite attempts to isolate Mr Pessina from the rest of the board and its advisers, Sir Nigel is faced with a delicate and complex situation. Mr Pessina is Alliance Boots’ linchpin. It was he who drove through the Boots-Alliance UniChem tie up last year and he who runs group strategy.Mr Pessina is also the company’s biggest shareholder, with a 15 per cent stake in the business, and is well-represented on the board, given that three of the six non-executives come from the Pessina camp. In addition to this, his desire to keep the current management team on board should garner support in the executive team.The KKR-Pessina tie-up is also likely to raise tensions within the consortium working on the Sainsbury deal, given that KKR’s partners – CVC, Texas Pacific Group and Blackstone – had no idea that the US buy-out firm was also working on a second deal to bag a FTSE 100 retailer.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson and Peter Smith
527;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-09T22:42:22Z;Alliance Boots;;Friday afternoons in the City of London used to be reserved for pre-pub contemplation. Not any more: BSkyB’s stake purchase in ITV and CSN’s bid for Corus were announced in the dying hours of the week. On Friday Alliance Boots, the drugs retailer and wholesaler formed in a merger last year, said it had received an approach, sending its shares up 14 per cent by the market’s close. Private equity, in this case Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, has once again pointed its acquisition blunderbuss. Pulling the trigger is Stefano Pessina, Alliance Boots’ executive deputy chairman and largest shareholder with a 15 per cent stake.The deal is big, with a £9.7bn equity value, which for a private equity industry struggling to deploy its cash has become an attraction in itself. Other merits include little gearing, with £600m-£900m of net debt expected at March 2007, a low degree of economic cyclicality and upside potential courtesy of the merger synergies. For the imaginatively minded, KKR, involved in other potential buy-outs such as J. Sainsbury, could even try to manoeuvre Alliance Boots into a retail consolidation play.But the case for a buy-out is hardly bulletproof: the wholesale business, contributing about a quarter of operating profits, faces structural pressure as pharmaceuticals groups look to squeeze their distribution chains. From a funding perspective, with only perhaps £1bn of freehold property at market prices, it will not be possible to finance the deal using a sale and leaseback of stores. Finally, there is valuation. Based on current analysts’ forecasts for 2008, which largely reflect the £100m of synergies targeted at the merger, the post-tax return on capital the deal would generate in the year to March 2008 is about 4 per cent. When managers launch bids shareholders rightly worry that they are at a disadvantage. But at this stage, based on what the market knows about the merger’s performance, the exit price looks attractive.
528;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-09T22:32:21Z;Pessina at the centre of the web;;By linking up with Stefano Pessina, the executive deputy chairman of Alliance Boots, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has joined up with the man who counts most at the pan-European retail and drugs distributor.The Italian billionaire, who pulled off a £7.8bn merger of Boots and Alliance UniChem in August last year, is Alliance Boots’s biggest shareholder with 15 per cent of the company. He also controls the board, given that seven of the 13 board members come from the Alliance UniChem ranks.One of those is Ornella Barra, his long-term partner, who trained as a pharmacist and built her own drugs distribution business. She sits on the board as wholesale and commercial affairs director and Pessina confidante. George Fairweather, the finance director, is also one of his lieutenants.Despite spending three decades building his pan-European business, Mr Pessina is tireless in his enthusiasm for making Alliance Boots bigger still.“When I decided to step down as chief executive [of Alliance UniChem at the end of 2004] it was to dedicate all my efforts to finding a transformation,” he said in an interview with the FT. He has made no secret of his desire to use the cash generated from Alliance Boots’ 2,600 retail outlets and pharmacies to fund deals.Mr Pessina is a skilled dealmaker. In his 34-year career, he has done three big deals, including creating Alliance Santé Group in 1989, then acquiring Britain’s UniChem in 1997.Another key Alliance Boots board member is Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman and one of the City’s most experienced mergers and acquisitions operators.The chief executive is Richard Baker, who joined Boots from Asda in September 2003.
529;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
530;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-09T22:32:21Z;Pessina’s long view creates yearning for privacy;;When Boots the Chemist merged with Alliance UniChem last July, Stefano Pessina, the founder of Alliance, hailed the £7.8bn deal as a transformational.Now he wants to take it private before the success he promised has been delivered.The 65-year-old, who owns 15 per cent of the company, has linked with KKR, the US private equity group, to make an approach valuing the company at £9.67bn.The timing and nature of the move raises tricky issues both for the board, which is conflicted, and for Alliance’s investors.First, the timing.Although the proposal apparently came to the board’s attention in recent days, it must have been on Mr Pessina’s mind for months beforehand.If he was interested in teaming up with private equity, it would have been neater to sell Alliance to a buy-out firm last year and then bid for Boots.One explanation for Mr Pessina’s about-turn could be that he has underestimated the difficulty of integrating this mammoth deal in the glare of the public markets.It will take several years to combine the two businesses. But the company has to update investors quarterly on its performance. That creates a conflict between day-to-day scrutiny by stock market investors and the management’s long-term priorities.Since completion last July, the share performance has been disappointing.Alliance Boots’ shares had risen just 3.7 per cent, excluding yesterday’s rise, while the FTSE 100 index is up more than 5 per cent.The tie-up received a cool reception when it was first mooted in October 2005.Investors questioned the curious governance structure. Boots was to provide the chairman and chief executive but Mr Pessina and his long-term partner, Ornella Barra, were also to sit on the board in executive roles.Scepticism appeared to be mounting.Alliance Boots’ most recent trading update missed market expectations, with like-for-like sales in its domestic retail business up only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter versus forecasts of 3 per cent.Analysts remain concerned that the integration could falter.In January, Morgan Stanley noted that every European retailing merger in recent years had been a disappointment and warned that investors were being over-optimistic about Alliance Boots’ ability to meet its proposed £100m-a-year synergy target.Richard Ratner, analyst at Seymour Pierce, says the mooted price of £10 a share seems “very steep” and implied an internal rate of return on a buy-out of 17 per cent. That is towards the bottom end of return expectations for a typical private equity deal.However, another analyst says Mr Pessina has little to gain from Alliance Boots continuing as a public company and points out that his long-term vision has been at odds with the City’s time horizon.“Some of the deals that he has done in Russia or China are the sorts of deals that could become significant in five or ten years. He takes a long-term view and if KKR back that approach, it is appealing to him.”Against that backdrop, Mr Pessina’s approach creates particular challenges for the board.It is not clear how much of the group he would be seeking to own following the deal but KKR would be looking to acquire the company as cheaply as possible.But it is duty of Allliance UniChem’s board to maximise value for the company’s shareholders.Yet KKR and Mr Pessina have indicated that they wish to retain the existing management. The board also includes old colleagues of Mr Pessina from Alliance, including Ms Barra. That creates potential conflicts.It will be up to the chairman, Sir Nigel Rudd, to ensure that all shareholders’ interests – and not just Mr Pessina’s – are safeguarded.The ultimate test of whether they are offered a fair price for the shares would be for another bidder to make a competing offer.So investors will want Sir Nigel to get an auction going. There is growing talk in the industry of the need for drug suppliers to buy into distribution chains.That could be one source of alternative buyers.Indeed, before KKR was confirmed as behind the approach, there was talk that Roche, the pharma giant, might be a bidder. Roche would not comment on the rumours yesterday.Alternatively, Sir Nigel could try to tease out another private equity buyer. That might prove challenging given that Mr Pessina himself has already teamed up with KKR.Further, the attractions of Alliance Boots are not as apparent as other recent retailing buy-outs.Its cash flows, which would be required to fund the interest on a leveraged deal, are vulnerable to slips during integration.Property experts say the company does not fit the mould of a real estate play – the justification for the bid approaches for J Sainsbury, Debenhams and Marks & Spencer over the last three years.Alliance Boots has about £665m of freehold property while renting £2.56bn of leasehold property, according to calculations by property advisers Donaldsons, based on annual reports last year. This makes it only 21 per cent freehold.Even valuing the 2,600-strong store portfolio at £1bn, taking into account real estate inflation, this is only a small proportion of the £9bn market value.
531;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-09T22:11:48Z;Alliance Boots faces £9.7bn bid from KKR;;Alliance Boots, Britain’s biggest chemist chain, on Friday night became the latest major high street target of a private equity firm.Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity powerhouse that is part of the consortium stalking J Sainsbury, has joined forces with Stefano Pessina, Alliance Boots’ billionaire executive deputy chairman, in an effort to buy the company for £10 a share.The news is likely to intensify the political debate about the power of private equity firms.The friendly approach, which values Alliance Boots at £9.7bn, comes a mere seven months after the merger of Alliance UniChem, Mr Pessina’s drugs distribution business, with Boots the Chemist, the health and beauty chain.News of the potential bid sent the shares soaring 115p, or 14 per cent, to 930p, valuing Alliance Boots at £9bn with an enterprise value of £10.2bn. The business was worth £7.78bn at the time of the merger last August.The offer is the latest in a deal frenzy by private equity groups that are putting to work record sums of their capital in M&A transactions all over the world.KKR and Mr Pessina, who has a 15 per cent stake in Alliance Boots, said the proposal was subject to due diligence, which could take three weeks once started. It is thought that Mr Pessina would re-invest heavily in the business should the bid be successful.Mr Pessina’s approach raised some eyebrows in the City given that the Italian-born billionaire had only just got his feet under the table in the enlarged group.The entrepreneur had wanted to merge with Boots for years before he achieved his goal, having made a rebuffed approach in 2000. The enlarged group owns 2,400 pharmacies and health and beauty stores across the UK.However, it is understood that the board is united behind the possible takeover. In the statement, KKR and Mr Pessina said their objective was to “work closely with the existing management team to achieve the long-term vision, building a global leader in the healthcare services and beauty industries”.It is thought that Mr Pessina is keen to press on with growing the business and thinks this can be done more quickly in the private sphere. One analyst said on Friday: “He has little interest in being quoted.”The company has underperformed the food and drug retail sector by 5 per cent this year.Additional reporting by Jim Pickard and Chris Hughes
532;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-09T18:46:53Z;Boots approach sparks FTSE gains;;A surprise bid approach for Alliance Boots helped the London market to a fourth straight day of gains and enabled the FTSE 100 to register its biggest weekly percentage gain this year.Retail stocks dominated the blue chip leaderboard as traders went in search of the next takeover target. DSG Internationalgained 3.7 per cent to 175½p, while Next advanced 3.6 per cent to £20.73, Kingfisher climbed 3.1 per cent to 257¼p and Home Retail Group climbed 2.1 per cent to 426p.Meanwhile, Boots finished 14.1 per cent higher at 930p. After the market closed Boots executive deputy chairman Stefano Pessina and private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts said they had made a £10 a share offer for the company.Wm Morrison, which gained 4.2 per cent to 320½p, was also caught up in the excitement, although its shares were on the move before Boots revealed the approach just after 3.15pm.Morrison’s stock was lifted by private equity bid rumours and a note from house broker ABN Amro, which advised clients to “buy” before next Thursday’s annual results and strategy presentation from new chief executive Marc Bolland.”Next week’s results should confirm the ongoing recovery and the strategic review should highlight the opportunities that lie ahead,” analyst Justin Scarborough said in a note to clients.Although he did not comment on the private equity bid rumours, Mr Scarborough said he believed Morrison’s property portfolio was worth £7.8bn - the equivalent of 296p-a-share.The strong performance of the retail sector and a reassuring US employment report helped the FTSE 100 close 17.5 points, or 0.3 per cent, higher at 6,245.2, taking its gains for the week to 2.1 per cent or 129 points.Lower down the market, the story was the much the same with the FTSE 250 rising 46.8 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 11,410.6 with retailer HMV Group, up 4.6 per cent to 152¾p, one of the biggest risers.Prudential added 1.9 per cent to 683p amid talk that next week’s full-year results could be accompanied by a return of capital to shareholders and plans to unlock the insurer’s £9bn inherited or orphan estate.Tate & Lyle firmed 0.6 per cent to 566p after Citigroup suggested the sugar producer could return cash to shareholders if it manages to sell its European starch business.On the downside, mining group Xstrata dropped 2.6 per cent to £24.50p after chief executive Mick Davis and three other executives declared the sale of stock worth £27.3m.In the same sector, Antofagasta was marked 1 per cent lower at 471p on vague rumours that it was considering a bid for Aim’s biggest company First Quantum Minerals, down 1.7 per cent to £29.37½p.Stockbroker Collins Stewart continued to recover from recent weakness. Its shares gained 4.9 per cent to 233p amid talk Monday’s results - the first since its demerger from money broker Tullett Prebon in December - will impress.Takeover rumours continued to swirl around Bovis Homes Group, up 3.9 per cent to £11.45. Friday’s speculation was fuelled by news that acquisitive rival Persimmon, 2.1 per cent stronger at £14.23, had dropped ABN Amro as joint broker.ABN is also broker to Bovis and traders said Persimmon’s move could be an indication that it was plotting a bid. Bovis has the most attractive land bank in the sector and Persimmon is thought to be on the lookout for deals having digested the acquisition of Westbury.However, sector watchers cautioned against reading too much into the move, noting that Persimmon has retained ABN when it bid for Westbury, which was also a client of the Dutch broker.First Choice Holidays gained 2.3 per cent to 275p as rumours of corporate activity continued to swirl. The latest rumour was that the tour operator might merge its airline business with rival Monarch.Admiral jumped 4.3 per cent to £11.23 after Andrew Crean, Citigroup’s highly-rated analyst, slapped a £12.25 target price on the motor insurer. Mr Crean reckons Admiral’s earnings per share will increase threefold by 2011.Among the small caps, a late flurry of buying saw Pipex, the broadband internet group, rise 14.3 per cent to 14p. Traders pinned the rise on rumours of a bid from a telecoms company.
533;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-03-09T14:30:34Z;Cheque refuseniks;;Boots has joined the growing band of retailers that won’t allow shoppers to pay by cheque. From May 1 the high street chemist will only accept credit or debit cards – as well as plain old cash – for most purchases across its nearly 1,500 stores.It joins the likes of WH Smith, Shell and Next which already refuse to accept cheques, according to the Association of Payment Clearing Services (Apacs).Apacs says the trend reflects shoppers’ increasing preference for other payment methods, particularly debit cards. Cheques now account for fewer than one in 20 retail transactions and are projected to fall to under one in 100 by 2015.Retailers also argue that banning cheques improves transaction speed and reduces queues. They also describe it as an anti-fraud measure: card transactions are now more secure thanks to “chip and pin” – which requires shop purchases to be authorised by a personal code.But while the use of cheques is on the wane, some argue that a ban takes away consumer choice and hits more vulnerable groups. “Many older people don’t like to shop with debit or credit cards and find it easier to pay and keep track of spending by paying with cheques instead,” says Help the Aged’s Sophie Davison.Boots says it will still accept cheques after May for pharmacy purchases.While the British Retailing Consortium insists that it’s unheard of (so far) for shoppers to be charged more for paying by cheque on the high street, some utilities are starting to penalise customers who use them. BT, citing higher processing costs, will from May charge customers who pay by cheque rather than direct debit an extra £4.50 a quarter.With talk of the end of free banking it’s also possible that banks could start charging for writing (and/or cashing) cheques.The death of the cheque, then? Maybe not yet: there’s little evidence that children are turning their noses up at presents that come in cheque form. Cynics might also argue that in a world where some cheques always go uncashed, it can make financial sense to keep writing them. Canny celebrities who know their signature is valued might be keen to carry on writing cheques for this reason.

Traders pointed out that Cazenove was now free to work for one of Anglo’s many rumoured suitors.In October, the market was rife with speculation that Cazenove was looking to work with Rusal, the Russian aluminium producer, on plans for a reverse takeover of Anglo.Cazenove is also broker to Xstrata, the acquisitive mining group that has been linked with a bid for Anglo several times in recent months. Xstrata shares fell 6.6 per cent to £24.79.However, Anglo played down the rumours. A spokesman described its parting with Cazenove as “very amicable” and the result of a decision to align its advisory relationships so that Goldman Sachs and UBS would act as both corporate broker and financial advisor to the company.Cynthia Carroll, the former Alcan executive, is due to succeed Tony Trahar as chief executive of Anglo on Thursday.Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 sank 2.3 per cent, or 148.6 points, to 6,286.1 in a wider global equity market sell-off.The FTSE 250 dropped 3.7 per cent, or 431.5 points, to 11,180.9, its worst one-day points fall ever.

Its shares shed 14.6 per cent to 73p after revealing it would not achieve margin targetsMarket turnover was heavy with more than 5.6bn shares changing hands. But that figure was inflated by huge the late trade of 1.6bn shares in Alliance Boots, off 1 per cent at 799p. However, dealers reckoned the trade was an error as the pharmacies group only has 967m shares in issue.Trade also was swollen by brisk trading in debutante Sports Direct International.

6.3 per cent, below its 300p offer price.Mining stocks led London lower. Seven of the 10 biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 came from the sector, which was spooked by the steep fall in the Chinese stock market and news the South African government is considering a tax on excessive profits made by mining companies.That news hit Lonmin, the South African platinum miner, hard. Its shares lost 6.2 per cent to £31.65, while BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, which also have operations in the country, shed 6.2 per cent to £10.51 and 4.8 per cent to £27.99 respectively.Elsewhere in the sector, Vedanta Resources dipped 4.9 per cent to £12.75 after Navin Agarwal, deputy executive chairman, declared the sale of stock worth almost £660,000.Reuters was the only blue-chip stock to close in positive. Shares in the news and financial information group improved 1.4 per cent to 432p after Credit Suisse put its neck on the block and upgraded ahead of Thursday’s full-year figures.Lifting its rating to “outperform” from “neutral”, the broker said the outlook
for Reuters had rarely looked better. “Our analysis of industry employment growth across the territories that generate 63 per cent of Reuters’ estimated revenue, shows banking headcount growing at one of the highest levels since 2001,” it said.HBOS managed to avoid the worst of Tuesday’s sell-off, ending just 1.5 per cent weaker at £11.33. The banking group’s stock was supported by talk that Wednesday’s full-year results will highlight a strong performance from its insurance business.Several analysts believe earnings in this division have been artificially depressed by international accounting standards.Away from the blue chips, GKN, the automotive engineer, was one of just three mid-cap companies to close in positive territory.

535;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-02-08T13:02:59Z;Reckitt ends the year with a bang;;Reckitt Benckiser, the world’s largest maker of household cleaners, on Thursday reported an 18 per cent increase in full-year sales and announced it would return an additional £300m through a share buyback programme this year on top of the increase in the dividend.It said fourth-quarter profit rose on savings from the purchase of Boots Group’s health-care unit and sales of goods including Vanish stain remover. It completed the $3.4bn purchase of Boots Healthcare International in January 2006, adding products such as Clearasil acne medicine.Bart Becht, chief executive, said: “Reckitt Benckiser had a record year in 2006, driven by new products such as Vanish Oxi Action Crystal White, Airwick Freshmatic, and Finish Quantum and the successful and rapid integration of BHI with synergies running ahead of targets.”Sales climbed to £4.92bn from £4.18bn during the year ended 31 December, helped by the new product sales. Pre-tax profit for the last quarter rose to £312m from £299m in the same period last year, while on the year it dropped by £2m to £874m.The upbeat results helped push the shares up 5 per cent to £26.17 and were in contrast to results from rival ICI. The UK chemicals group on Thursday reported that weakness in the North American paints division had led to a fall in fourth quarter margins.Mr Becht also said the company is aiming to buy health-care businesses this year to expand a range of cold medicines and pain-relief drugs that includes the Lemsip and Nurofen brands.“Our acquisition policy is the same as it has been for some time,” he said. “Our first objective is looking at companies making products similar to our own and the second is to add new products”.The company recommended a final dividend of 25p, bringing the full-year dividend to 45.5p, an increase of 17 per cent. It also said it will return another £300m to shareholders in 2007 through a share buyback programme.
536;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-01-29T21:02:21Z;Why the Pru’s review of its UK arm is critical;;"Tucker’s future depends on success at homeHaving cleared Egg from his plate, Mark Tucker, chief executive of Prudential, now faces a long menu of options for the company’s other UK operations. The dishes on offer range from an outright sale of the business to the least radical approach of cutting back the product range and outsourcing some of the back-office functions.With most media and research coverage of Prudential based in the UK, the domestic operation gets intense attention – as Monday’s dissection of the decision to sell Egg, the online bank, demonstrated. Yet some 75 per cent of the group’s profit for 2005 was generated outside Britain, where growth in new business, as Monday’s full-year 2006 figures showed, is also strongest – up 21 per cent in the US and 30 per cent in Asia, on an annual premium equivalent basis.The focus on the UK is also partly due to the fact that Britain has a better-known peer group of insurers. The new business figures for 2006 indicated the Pru’s UK performance was stabilising – despite fierce competition in bulk annuities – but they looked less rosy than Legal & General’s figures last week.So, unfair though it may seem (L&G’s figures were not directly comparable to the Pru’s) Mr Tucker is condemned to reform the UK business. Divesting Egg, a screeching U-turn from the direction set in 2005, does remove a drag on the company. Some investors, many analysts and most journalists would probably like to see a similarly radical reassessment of the UK insurance arm in the March review. But the least revolutionary option – using a back-office specialist like Capita, or one of its rivals, to handle the insurance administration and focusing the business on the more profitable products, such as individual annuities – would be more sensible.As a company, Prudential can prosper from its international operations, which help underpin the present level of the shares, but, as chief executive, Mr Tucker will only get to enjoy the fruit of growth overseas if the UK investment community approves his plans for the home market, come March.Alliance’s alliancesGiven the number of western companies that have had a soaking in China because they misread the market climate or the stormy regulatory environment, it makes sense for Alliance Boots to wear a raincoat and carry an umbrella.The UK drug distribution and retail company’s joint venture in China is in fact two new ventures.A new UK vehicle, Alliance BMP, has Beijing Med-Pharm, a US listed “fixer” for western pharmaceutical companies wishing to sell their products in China, as 20 per cent junior partner. Alliance BMP will in turn own half of Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation (GP); the other half will be held (pay attention) by Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Company, GP’s current majority-owner.Thanks to this series of Chinese boxes, Alliance Boots’ already modest headline investment of £38m is in fact £30m. There is also less to the market share figures than meets the eye. The fact that GP is China’s third-largest pharmaceutical wholesaler, yet has only a 3 per cent sliver of the market, looks striking, but the joint venture will, at least at first, tackle GP’s home region of Guangdong (population 78m), rather than the entire country. The 29 retail pharmacies that GP will be allowed to open sounds wildly insufficient (that’s a queue of 2.7m at the counter if everybody in Guangdong needs a prescription filling on Saturday morning), but most Chinese patients get drugs through hospitals. Alliance Boots initially aims to exploit the wholesale not the retail channels in China.This is reminiscent of the old Alliance Unichem approach to previous investments in new markets, from Norway to the Netherlands: build knowledge, then expand. This joint venture won’t relieve the squeeze on Alliance Boots’ UK retail business overnight – the process of regulatory and government approval could last well into the second half of 2007 – but, if successful, it won’t be the last China has heard of the UK company’s multi-tiered strategy.Countrywide’s hot seatPredator-managers – executives who try to buy their own companies – should quit if their bid fails. But the failed buy-out at Countrywide may be the exception that proves the rule.If the 3i-led bid had succeeded, Harry Hill, who had already stepped down as group managing director, would have become chairman of the estate agency network. The recommended bid did not reach the 75 per cent threshold for success, leaving Mr Hill in limbo.Contrary to expectations, however, the share price has held up, which suggests that continuity is now in the interests of all shareholders – those that opposed the deal and those that backed it but have stuck with Countrywide. Mr Hill should be asked to take the chairmanship.andrew.hill@ft.comwww.ft.com/lombard"
537;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-01-29T12:09:25Z;Pru drops Egg;;This morning was looking a little quiet until Prudential dropped Egg. Most of it has landed on its own face, however. Pru is selling the online bank to Citigroup for £575m in cash. This may be a respectable two times book value, but it comes about a year after the Pru itself valued the loss-making online bank at almost £1bn when it bought in the 21 per cent it did not already own for £200m. The Pru was even offered about £1bn from Royal Bank of Scotland, and Citigroup, two years ago. To make matters worse, the Pru has come out with new business figures today which, although better than some had feared, look weak next to L&G and St James’s Place last week. The Pru’s shares rose 2 per cent after the announcements but this must be because it looks more like a takeover target. Our reporters listening to the conference call with chief executive Mark Tucker think he sounded very defensive. With reason.Alliance Boots, struggling to scratch growth out of its domestic market, is moving into China with a joint venture with Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation, the country’s third largest pharmaceutical wholesaler.Shares in consumer debt advisers continue to plummet today, providing us with a good topic to get stuck into. Accuma on Friday warned of slower growth in its individual voluntary arrangement business and saw its shares halve. This morning, the stock is down another 20 per cent. Debt Free Direct also warned on Friday but, although its shares had fallen a bit after the Accuma statement, its news came after the market had closed. This morning, its shares are down 34 per cent. Both Accuma and Debt Free Direct blamed increased resistance from the banks, though why anyone was surprised is a mystery. Debts.co.uk, down 4 per cent this morning, issued a very defensive statement this morning saying it was doing just fine. Debtmatters is off 26 per cent this morning but no statement yet.We’ll also return to Jim Pickard’s fascinating story this morning about new data showing the commercial property boom may be at an end. Analysis by Lambert Smith Hampton of every deal done in the second half of 2006, covering £27.5bn of transactions, shows that yields have started to tick back up again after falling for the last five years.

538;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-01-29T08:58:47Z;Alliance Boots in China venture;;Alliance Boots, the drug distribution and retail company, is to enter the Chinese market through a joint venture with Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation, the country’s third largest pharmaceutical wholesaler.The UK company will acquire a 50 per cent stake in GP Corp through a partnership with Beijing Med-Pharm Corporation, a US-listed pharmaceutical marketing and distribution company with “significant experience” of entering the Chinese market.Alliance Boots will make the acquisition from existing resources through a UK subsidiary in which BMP will take a 20 per cent stake.The subsidiary will buy a 50 per cent stake in GP Corp for a total consideration of around £38m from Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Company, a state-controlled company listed on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.Most of Alliance Boots’ retail business is in the UK, where it faces intensifying competition from supermarket chains. Since its formation last year by a merger of Boots and Alliance Unichem, it has been expanding internationally – including into Russia and Egypt.The investment gives the UK-listed company entry to the world’s ninth largest pharmaceutical market. The Chinese wholesale and distribution market is fragmented and largely regionally based, and mainly operates through supplying hospital pharmacies.GP Corp has a 3 per cent market share, and is the largest such company in Guangdong province with 16 per cent of the market. With eight depots and around 2,000 employees, it reported revenue of around £425m for 2005.BMP is listed on Nasdaq, and offers pre-market entry analysis for China, clinical trial management, product registration, market research, pharmaceutical distribution to hospitals and marketing to healthcare providers.Alliance Boots shares rose 2p to 823p, following the announcement.Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance Boots, said: “The move into the Chinese market demonstrates Alliance Boots’ commitment to growing internationally and our attractiveness to partners. China is an exciting and important market for us to enter.“This joint venture brings together strong local management and our extensive experience in running pharmaceutical wholesaling businesses. We expect GP Corp to benefit from both the rapid expansion of the Chinese healthcare market and further consolidation opportunities as they arise.”The formation of the joint venture, which is conditional on Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Company shareholder approval and various government and regulatory approvals, is expected to be completed in the second half of 2007.On completion, GP Corp is expected to operate 29 retail pharmacies, the maximum permitted under current regulations for a 50:50 foreign joint venture.The joint venture expands Alliance Boots’ wholesale operations to 15 countries. Its network serves more than 125,000 pharmacies, hospitals and health centres through 380 depots in 14 countries in Europe and the Middle East.The group, which employs around 100,000 people, also has around 3,000 retail outlets in eight countries, including Thailand.Merrill Lynch is financial adviser to Alliance Boots.
539;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-01-26T17:26:51Z;On London: Competition on the High Street;;"Is Tesco killing off the competition? Certainly some of its supermarket rivals seem to think so. And plenty of high street shops must be asking the same question in a week when the retailing giant’s dominance was singled out by the Competition Commission as a potential cause of concern.Tesco already has nearly a third of the UK food market, so increasingly growth will come from non-food and overseas expansion. That is likely to mean little relief from Tesco’s pressure on other listed retailers.The drive in non-food items – clothes, books, stationery, DVDS, furniture, toys, electricals, etc – has been apparent for some time. Indeed, in September 2004, I wrote a column questioning whether it made sense for private investors to hold shares in high street chains directly exposed to the Tesco threat.That is because the supermarkets have the economies of scale and pricing power to make life very difficult for a range of high street competitors, including WH Smith, Alliance Boots, Woolworths and HMV.Since then, Tesco’s shares have risen 45 per cent, while HMV’s shares have fallen 42 per cent and Woolworths’ have fallen by 27 per cent. Shares in Alliance Boots (then only Boots) have risen a modest 15 per cent while only WH Smith has outperformed Tesco, with a share price rise of 65 per cent.All the companies involved have undertaken – or discussed – strategic moves. Boots has merged with Alliance UniChem; HMV, which already owned Waterstones, has bought Ottakars; while WH Smith has demerged its wholesale news distribution business from its retail operations. Woolworths was nearly bought two years ago, but Apax Partners eventually abandoned its £837m offer.WH Smith, best performer of the bunch, has rewarded investors, not by growing its sales but by increasing its margins. That is a testament to the skills of Kate Swann, its chief executive. It helped WH Smith’s shares hit five-and-a-half year highs this week. But WH Smith is still a shrinking business, sales falling every year since 2002. The 20 weeks to January 20 were no different: like-for-like sales fell 6 per cent.WH Smith’s position compares favourably with that of HMV, which has been battered by price deflation in CDs and DVDs, increased online buying, and supermarket incursions into book-selling.Woolworth’s faces the same issues about CDs and DVDs, and like HMV was forced to issue a profits warning before Christmas. The group’s underlying sales in the six weeks to January 13 fell 4.6 per cent.Boots has achieved modest sales growth. Its merger with Alliance UniChem was designed partly to place less emphasis on low-margin retail business like selling toothbrushes and headache pills, bolstering areas like healthcare and wholesale.Whether that amounts to reinventing itself enough to form long-term value for shareholders is doubtful.On Monday Boots will become the first high street chain to open a GP surgery in one of its shops. Guess what? J Sainsbury has similar plans. The wholesale business is likely to face pressure from big drug manufacturers, who mean to take more control of distribution.Tesco’s challenge in the non-food area – about a fifth of its sales – is only going to increase. Long-term, that could be a cause of concern to any number of retailers, from DSG International – the owner of Dixons – and Kesa Electricals to Halfords or even Kingfisher. One chain that may feel particular heat in the next few years is Argos as Tesco rolls out Tesco Direct, its non-food catalogue and shopping website.The point is the retail groups that will prosper in the high street will be those with distinct propositions or with a breadth and depth of offering in their area the supermarkets cannot match.Supermarkets are not the only reason many high street chains struggle: these stores also face intense pressure from the internet and from consumer spending that is being restrained by higher interest rates.Which brings us to the issue of value. Perhaps the real hope for investors in chains like HMV and Woolworth’s is that private equity or the Icelandic investment group Baugur or Scottish entrepreneur Tom Hunter will come along and buy them. HMV’s former management turned down a private equity offer worth 210p a share from Permira last March. One can’t help suspecting that if the current management got offered the same deal today – when the shares are at 133p – they would snap it up. Baugur has a 10 per cent stake in Woolworth’s. There are constant rumours it plans a full bid with a view to restructuring. Clearly both companies may become so cheap they are bought. But don’t count on it. Tesco shares, for all the competition concerns, seem less of a gamble."
540;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-01-24T18:33:54Z;FTSE boosted by close rate vote;;Debenhams failed to contribute to a strong rally in the UK market on Wednesday as a leading investment bank slashed its stance on the department store chain.Claire Kent, analyst at Morgan Stanley, cut the stock from “overweight” to “equalweight” and lowered her profit forecasts by 16 and 20 per cent respectively over the next two years in a downbeat assessment of the company’s prospects.Debenhams this month reported a continued fall in underlying sales and a decline in gross margin.“Our expectation [is] that the consumer outlook will remain weak and competition is on the increase,” Ms Kent wrote. “We see no catalyst for the stock to perform in the next three to six months.”Debenhams closed down 1.5 per cent at 167½p, its lowest level since the company was re-floated at 195p eight months ago.In the wider market, the news that four members of the Bank of England monetary policy committee opposed January’s shock interest rate rise stoked hopes that the current rate tightening cycle could be nearing its end.The FTSE 100 surged 87.2 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 6,314.8, its highest level since January 3. Miners, property companies, banks and oil stocks contributed to the sharp rise. The FTSE 250 rose 90.6 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 11,192.8.News that the US would double the size of the national oil reserve and purchase an extra 100,000 barrels of oil a day boosted the crude price late on Tuesday. Royal Dutch Shell rose 1.2 per cent to £17.39 and BP gained 0.6 per cent to 548½p. Sentiment in the sector was further boosted by reports of a $15bn bid for US energy group Dominion Resources.Mining stocks rose sharply amid some bullish strategy notes as nickel and tin, hit fresh highs. Kazakh copper mine Kazakhmys rose 4.8 per cent to £11.19 as HSBC suggested investors take a “short term long position” on the stock following a 16 per cent drop in its share price the last three months.India-based exploration group Vedanta Resources was the day’s top performer, ending 5.8 per cent higher at £11.90 amid a flurry of takeover speculation. Any deal would hinge on Anil Agarwal, the group’s founder and majority shareholder.Reduced expectations of increased interest rates sent property groups Liberty International and British Land 4.4 per cent higher to £13.18 and 2.9 per cent higher to £16.12 respectively. Liberty was further boosted by vague takeover speculation.Financial stocks also made good gains as Northern Rock kicked off the bank reporting season with news of better than expected profits and record mortgage lending of £33bn last year. Northern Rock rose 4.1 per cent to £12.12, Royal Bank of Scotland firmed 2.9 per cent to £21.03 and Alliance & Leicester gained 2.6 per cent to £11.11.Hanson rose 2.9 per cent to 799½p amid reheated talk that Lafarge of France was eyeing a bid for the aggregates specialist.Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionary group, rose 1.2 per cent to 560½p despite a shock profit warning from US chocolate maker Hershey’s.Alliance Boots spent most of the day in the red after Morgan Stanley slashed the chemist group from “equalweight” to “underweight” and said the market had not factored in the risks associated with the merger that created the company. But the shares ended 1.1 per cent higher at 812½p.Of the fallers, InterContinental Hotels Group slipped 1.4 per cent to £12.86 as takeover talk faded.Sage Group lost 0.4 per cent to 271¾p as ING slashed its stance on the software and services group from “hold” to “sell”.In the mid-caps, the day’s best performer was N Brown, the home shopping group. Its shares surged 9.6 per cent to a six-year high of 311½p thanks to a sharp rise in like-for-like sales and a pledge to return £80m to shareholders.Strong figures from pub groups JD Wetherspoon and Punch Taverns sent the pair 5.5 per cent higher to 700p and 3.4 per cent higher to £11.95 respectively.The higher crude price and rumours that a takoever bid was coming in the sector sent oil services companies higher. Wood Grouprose 4.5 per cent to 272¾p, Expro International firmed 4.2 per cent to 910½p and Huntingrose 2.7 per cent to 592½p.However, a profit warning dragged Renishaw14.4 per cent lower to 685p. The manufacturer of precision instruments blamed weak demand and the strong pound.
541;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-01-19T18:48:33Z;On London: The “sell” scarcity in analysts’ recommendations;;"It still goes against the grain of most stock market analysts to issue “sell” recommendations on a company.When reforms of the broking industry were pushed through by Eliot Spitzer, the then New York Attorney-General, in the wake of the bursting of the dotcom bubble, a new world of independent and critical analysis was supposed to have emerged.There has been a shift, but one curious anomaly has persisted – the dearth of sell recommendations.Not even the requirement for banks to disclose the proportion of buy and sell recommendations has done much to alter behaviour.Thomson IBES, the data company, estimates there are only 14 stocks in the FTSE 350 for which the consensus of analyst recommendations is negative. For the record, they are Alliance & Leicester, Alliance Boots, Derwent Valley, F&C Asset Management, Gallaher, Jardine Lloyd Thompson, Kelda, Liberty International, MyTravel,
J Sainsbury, Tomkins, Trinity Mirror, United Utilities and Woolworths.For the whole UK market, Thomson IBES estimates that only 12.7 per cent of broker recommendations are “sells”, compared with 46.9 per cent for “buys” (and the balance “holds”).For the FTSE 100, the situation is not much different. Factset JCF, another data company, estimates that only 18.7 per cent of the broker notes on bluechip stocks are negative, compared with 43.9 per cent positive and 37.4 per cent neutral.Does all this signify some “pushback” on the Spitzer reforms, particularly those aimed at strengthening the Chinese walls between investment bank corporate finance activities and research?Reluctance to upset corporate finance clients is undoubtedly still a factor, even if not as explicit or widespread as in the 1990s. As one analyst says, fees from corporate finance clients are still bigger than from institutions using broking services.But there are other reasons for the dearth of sell notes. One, simply, is the market trend. A rising tide lifts most boats on the stock market.Andrew Pitt, head of investment research at Citigroup for Europe, Middle East and Africa, points out that in a year when stock markets rise by the long-term average rate of 7 to 8 per cent, about 20 to 25 per cent of stocks would be expected to fall in absolute terms. Last year, when the European DJ Stoxx index rose 18 per cent, only 13 per cent of stocks within it fell.“If analysts had produced more sell notes than this last year, they would have been too bearish and wrong,” he says. Mr Pitt adds that many of the stocks that have been added to the coverage lists of investment banks in recent years have been small and mid-sized companies. These stocks have strongly outperformed, particularly benefiting from private equity buyouts and takeovers.There are also economic factors. Buy recommendations deliver more broking revenues than sells, partly because there are fewer investors around who “short” stocks – betting on price falls. This is particularly the case in smaller and mid-sized stocks. As such, brokers at this level find it difficult to justify initiating and maintaining coverage on stocks unless they feel confident enough to put a buy on them.One other reason cited by Shai Hill, head of research at Arbuthnot, is that some investment banks do not put out their best sell ideas as formal recommendations. They are often circulated as short and sharp trading ideas from the sales department.Similarly, it has long been suggested that many “hold” recommendations are actually diplomatic sells. Psychological factors also have long played a part in the dominance of buy notes. Stockmarket analysts have traditionally been over-optimistic, being forced to scale back earnings estimates as the year progressed. But in recent years, they have tended to under-estimate the strength of earnings, but the predilection for rose-tinted views may have persisted.“To put a sell on a company is still a much tougher call. Somehow clients don’t mind so much if you put out a buy and it does not quite go so well. It is much more uncomfortable to stick with a sell call that has gone wrong,” says one analyst. “There also is a natural tendency to want to be positive about the companies you cover and interact with.”The latter factor is a reason why more positive biographies line bookshelves than critical ones. Still it could be worse. On Wall Street, Factset JCF estimates only 4.1 per cent of recommendations on stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are negative. Anecdotal evidence suggests the pattern is similar in broader indices.What would Mr Spitzer make of that low rate?"
542;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-01-19T11:34:37Z;Kevin Goldstein-Jackson: Managerial magic with Harry Potter;;I have always been interested in turnround, spin-off and takeover situations – but a lot depends on the circumstances of the deal and the management.For example, in the FT in September 2003 I highlighted the synergies between the healthcare divisions of Boots and Reckitt Benckiser. If Boots had proposed spinning off its healthcare division to existing shareholders, I might have invested. Instead, it put the division up for sale and Reckitt Benckiser bought it.I might also have invested in Boots if it had been more creative. For example, why not have a display of “self-help” and medical books near the prescriptions counter so that people waiting for their pills and potions might buy such books and discover they had even more ailments and choice of medications?I was not enamoured of the merger between Alliance UniChem and Boots.Similarly, for many years I thought EMI Group would benefit from spinning off its music publishing business as a separate company. But I felt that with Eric Nicoli as chairman this was unlikely to happen.In 1986/87 my wife was briefly a small investor in United Biscuits when Nicoli was managing director of UB Brands. I had hoped the company would sell its frozen and chilled foods division (which included pizzas and Young’s fish products) and possibly its snack foods (including Hula Hoops) and return the proceeds to shareholders. It might then concentrate on expanding sales worldwide of its McVities biscuits (including Jaffa Cakes and Penguin) and invent more biscuit-like products.Nicoli became chief executive of United Biscuits in 1991. In the FT in September 1998, John Willman pointed out that since Nicoli’s appointment UB’s share price had underperformed the market by 75 per cent and earnings per share had halved. Nicoli resigned from UB in April 1999 to become executive chairman of EMI Group. When this was announced press comments included “surprise” and “disappointment”, although Nicoli had been a non-executive director of EMI since 1993.In August 1999, Nicoli’s UB successor announced plans to sell the chilled and frozen foods business and UB attracted much takeover attention.EMI is again in the news following disappointing results. Having heard Robbie Williams’ latest album, I am amazed EMI pinned so much hope on it. But then, in 2002 it was reported that although EMI had paid a fortune to “acquire” Mariah Carey, it had “terminated” her contract, paying her £19.3m, partly because of “disappointing sales”. Carey went on to top worldwide charts in 2005 with The Emancipation of Mimi.I feel EMI should have pioneered new methods of music distribution and promotion and highlighted the better sound quality of various formats. It should have had a larger and more varied roster of artists with greater cross-promotion between countries. It should also have devoted more attention to finding and nurturing talent.Will a private equity firm acquire EMI and split it in two and make lots of money? Or will it overpay, borrow too much, cut the artiste roster even further until sales are so low that any takeover by a major record company would be unlikely to attract regulatory opposition?My self-invested personal pension (Sipp) has a small stake in Bloomsbury Publishing as a result of Bloomsbury’s takeover in 2000 of A&C Black which I have held since 1987. On December 11, Bloomsbury issued a trading update in which it reported “lower than expected pre-Christmas sales” combined with “delays in reference rights sales budgeted for 2006” and profits could be less than market expectations.The shares promptly fell 29 per cent to 220p. I felt this was an over-reaction as the company was expected to have cash of “not less” than £20m at December 31, 2006 and some booksellers are already taking pre-orders for the next Harry Potter book. Interest in Harry should also be enhanced in 2007 by a new film.This year has also started well for other Bloomsbury authors with Lisa See’s Snow Flower and the Secret Fan entering the top 20 UK mass market fiction list. Although it has been claimed that Bloomsbury has overpaid some authors, I prefer its management to that of EMI. My Sipp therefore increased its holding in Bloomsbury on December 12, paying 221p a share.
543;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-01-11T21:50:25Z;Bumper season for Sainsbury’s;;J Sainsbury offered further proof on Thursday that the UK’s food retailers enjoyed a bumper Christmas as it joined Wm Morrison in delivering strong underlying trading figures over the festive period.The third-largest supermarket group said its underlying sales rose 5 per cent in the 12 weeks to December 30, raising expectations that Tesco, due to report next week, will also have had a good run.Meanwhile, TNS Worldpanel, the industry research body, said the grocery market had grown 11 per cent year-on-year in the two weeks to December 31. It said Tesco and Asda had outperformed the market over that period – even though the latter lost ground to Sainsbury’s over the quarter, and the gap between the two chains’ market share narrowed to 0.2 percentage points.“All the majors did indeed have an excellent Christmas,” said Edward Garner, TNS research director. “This suggests while consumers may have been hesitant to spend large sums of money, they significantly raised their supermarket spending over the two weeks.”Those feeling the fallout from strong supermarket trading yesterday included HMV, the music, books and video retailer that plunged into first-half losses as it was forced to cut prices in an attempt to take on supermarkets and online retailers.Alliance Boots, which competes in some product areas with the supermarkets, also delivered lacklustre figures on Thursday.Overall, however, the picture was more benign as a number of chains – John David, Signet and Game – produced solid numbers adding weight to the sentiment that Christmas was not the doom and gloom scenario that some City analysts had predicted.Justin King, Sainsbury’s chief executive, delivering his eighth consecutive quarter of like-for-like sales growth, said the company’s recovery remained “firmly” on track.David McCarthy, retail analyst at Citigroup, said Sainsbury’s had met his expectations, but added he was looking for only limited operating margin increases in the second half, despite better-than-expected sales growth. “It seems extra sales are not proving that profitable and this points to continued operational inefficiency.”Sainsbury’s is opening a new warehouse in the summer – although it said yesterday it would not change its capital expenditure forecast of £700m-£750m for the year to March, against £525m last year.Like Morrison, Sainsbury’s has capitalised on the increasing appetite for premium foods.Mr King said grocery inflation had risen 1.7 per cent on the back of rising energy and commodity prices as well as cost increases in fresh produce.
544;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;FTSE rallies despite surprise BoE rate rise;;Ladbrokes was in focus on Thursday as the London market ended sharply higher after a rollercoaster day caused by a shock interest rate rise.Shares in the bookmaker rose 1.5 per cent to 438½p in heavy volume of 20m shares on rumours of private equity bid interest.Sector specialists said the stock had also found support from Wednesday’s upbeat trading statement from rival William Hill, unchanged at 639½p.Media stocks were also to the fore. Broadcaster ITVwas the sector’s most heavily traded stock, rising 2.1 per cent to 109¼p on turnover of 72m shares after Deutsche Bank upgraded to “buy” in a 43-page research report titled ‘Grade Expectations’.“We think Michael Grade [as executive chairman] will transform ITV’s prospects and believe there remains considerable value in the franchise,” the broker said, setting a 130p target price.However, the sector’s best performer was Pearson, parent company of the Financial Times, which finished 3.7 per cent stronger at 805p – its highest level since March 2006.Traders said the stock was lifted by Wednesday’s “buy” recommendation from Deutsche Bank. The broker argued Pearson could be vulnerable to a private equity bid in the absence of a radical restructuring.Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing house, gained 3.5 per cent to 602½p on rumours that a leading private equity house was plotting an approach, while Reuters, the news and financial information group, added 3.6 per cent to 451¾p.Yell Group, the Yellow Pages publisher, was also in demand after Goldman Sachs became the second broker in two days to make positive comments on the group’s US business.“We believe Yell’s US organic growth will continue at 10 per cent for the next two financial years,” said the broker. Yell rose 3.5 per cent to 598p.After a strong opening, the FTSE 100 fell by 60 points after the Bank of England’s surprise decision to raise interest rates to 5.25 per cent. But it later rebounded to end 69.4 points, or 1.1 per cent, higher at 6,230.1.Traders attributed the rally to a strong opening on Wall Street, less hawkish inflation rhetoric from the ECB, and renewed interest in mining stocks as commodity prices rallied. BHP Billiton added 4.9 per cent to 930p, while Kazakhmys moved up 3.9 per cent to £10.53.Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 rose 37.4 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 11,123.4.Market turnover reached 4.5bn shares, swollen by large placings in PartyGaming and Savills, the property group.PartyGaming fell 4.4 per cent to 32¼p after UBS placed 160m shares at 30½p on behalf of former director Vikrant Bhargava. Meanwhile, Savills shed 0.8 per cent to 642p after CB Richard Ellis sold its 19.2 per cent stake at 623p a share.Royal & Sun Alliance climbed 3.3 per cent to 157p after the insurer was upgraded by Citigroup in a sector review. The broker believes RSA will rethink its dividend policy on completing the sale of its US business.“We think a move to a 50 per cent payout is a good balance between funding growth and shareholder returns, suggesting a dividend per share of 7p for 2007 (other forecasts are in a range of 4.9p-6.2p),” it said.Elsewhere, there was a speculative buzz around Lloyds TSB, which rose 0.9 per cent to 583p on rumours of predatory interest from one of the Spanish banks, Banco Santander or BBVA.Still on the speculative tack, International Power gained 2.8 per cent to 361¼p after a Gazprom executive said the company may take stakes in western European power companies.BG Group, which has fallen 11 per cent in the first seven trading days of 2007, rallied 2.7 per cent to 649½p after a push from Cazenove.“Ask yourself how many production warnings from larger cap oil companies does the market need to appreciate BG’s consistent growth really is a unique proposition,” the broker said.Gyrus, the medical devices group, rose 3.7 per cent to 402½p on rumours it could be a takeover target for a US rival.On the downside, disappointing Christmas trading updates saw Alliance Boots fall 2.7 per cent to 811p and J Sainsbury shed 1 per cent to 410¼p respectively.Most housebuilders ended the day lower in response to the interest rate increase with Persimmon down 1 per cent to £14.57 and Redrow off 3.2 per cent at 668 ½p.Pub companies were under also pressure again after Deutsche Bank said operators were unlikely to adopt Reit status until the middle of 2008. Enterprise Inns shed 1.7 per cent to £12.77, while Punch Taverns slipped 3.7 per cent to £11.69.
545;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-01-11T14:59:08Z;Surprise slowdown at Alliance Boots;;Alliance Boots on Thursday reported an unexpected slowdown in revenue growth at its UK stores in the Christmas trading quarter.The drug distributor and retailer, still in its first business year following the £8bn merger of Boots and Alliance Unichem, said like-for-like sales in its UK retail division edged up just 1.5 per cent.Analysts had expected to see growth of 3.1 per cent on average, according to a poll by Reuters.The company, which had reported revenues up 2.9 per cent to £7bn in the six months to September, said revenue growth in the most recent quarter been reduced partly by a cut in the amount the government reimburses the company for dispensing generic prescription drugs.It also cited the fact that the calendar quarter contained one fewer Saturday and one additional Sunday than the previous year, but analysts are likely to have included this in their calculations.Alliance Boots’ international pharmacies posted stronger performance, with like-for-like sales up 2.7 per cent. But the greater size of its UK operation meant growth as a whole across the retail division was 1.6 per cent.Richard Baker, chief executive, nonetheless said the group had “performed well” during the quarter and matched its expectations. He said the results “reinforce our confidence for the full year”.Like-for-like growth in the group’s wholesale division came in at the same level as retail. But total wholesale revenue jumped 14.3 per cent in northern Europe thanks partly to the effect of two medium-sized acquisitions: of Cordia Healthcare in the UK and Apteka in Russia.The shares were 22½p lower at 811p in afternoon London trading.
546;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2007-01-11T11:30:57Z;Mixed basket from the retailers;;A very mixed set of trading updates from retailers has underwhelmed the market today. J Sainsbury, the largest to report, said like-for-like sales rose 5 per cent over Christmas as it delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of like-for-like sales growth. However, Alliance Boots reported an unexpected slowdown in revenue growth at its UK stores in the Christmas trading quarter: like-for-like sales there edged up just 1.5 per cent. And HMV, which issued a profit warning just before Christmas, announced a second-half loss and said the managing director of HMV UK, Steve Knott, was leaving. Like-for-like sales in the five weeks to January 6 fell 0.8 per cent: HMV UK & Ireland increased like-for-like sales by 0.7 per cent, while Waterstone’s saw a 2 per cent decline. You can watch video of our reporter Tom Braithwaite discussing HMV on FT.com.We also have a strong statement from sports retailer John David Group and Game Group, the recovering video games retailer, plus decent sales numbers from Dobbies Garden Centres, where Sir Tom Hunter has a large stake, and disappointing numbers from Ideal Shopping Direct. Later today we’ll hear good news from Signet, the jeweller. With so much retail news around I think we run a “wrap” story on an outside page leading on Sainsbury’s and then run the full details on a special page inside. We’ll summarise for you who all the Christmas winners and losers are so far, although we have yet to hear from Tesco, Debenhams, DSG International, Home Retail (Argos), Kesa, Woolworths and WH Smith.Outside retailing, we a load of trading updates from such companies as SIG (ahead of forecasts), Interserve (in line with weak expectations), Man Group (ho-hum asset growth), Informa (in line), Redrow (cautious outlook), UK Coal (in line), and Spectris (strong).And we have a very good scoop from James Mackintosh, our new-ish hedge funds correspondent. Julius Baer has sold its $9bn London fixed-income investment boutique to management, he says, just 18 months after the Swiss bank bought the far larger Global Asset Management from rival UBS. The newly independent division – rebranded as Augustus Asset Managers – has recruited Howard Carter, former chief executive of Foreign & Colonial, the UK-based investment trust group, as non-executive chairman.The Business magazine says Imperial Tobacco is considering a €10bn bid for Altadis of Spain. We’ll check this out.Rumour of the Day: PartyGaming shares are down 4 per cent on talk that UBS is placing 160m shares. Neil Hume on our markets desk says the shares were placed on behalf of a former non-executive director in just five minutes. One hedge fund was short, we hear, and lapped up nearly half the shares on offer.Make or read a commentSee previous blogs
547;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2006-11-27T20:16:55Z;Dad, leave this one to your daughter;;"You would have thought any taste for organic food might have been soured by experience for Malcolm Walker, the founder of Iceland. It was, after all, a switch to organics that was partly responsible for the frozen food retailer’s poor performance in the dark days of 2001 when he was drummed out.But the ever-resilient Walker, who has since been reinstated as chief executive at Iceland, under new owners, seems to have had more luck with a new organic venture that he jointly owns with his daughter Caroline, who runs the business.The contrast with Iceland, with its cheery red fascia and ferociously bright lights, could not be more marked. Shoppers are soothed by world music as they wander aisles featuring a large selection of organic produce such as Goji berries, paraben-free shampoos and seaweed.The shop’s logo features a calming green leaf on a beige background.The three-store chain, As Nature Intended, has been harnessing the trend towards healthier eating and is poised to expand across London and in other UK cities. According to Ms Walker, the business turns over £5m and is profitable.Ms Walker says there are advantages to having a seasoned retail veteran for a father – “He’s got a lot of experience to lean on” – but confesses that sometimes she just has to tell him to “shut up and go away”.Then think againBoots is promoting “giftable ideas” for Christmas. Is this dreadful use of language what is meant by “It’s the thought that counts”?It’s a knockoutGeoffrey C Ward upset the bookmakers on Monday by winning the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award. Unforgivable Blackness, Ward’s biography of Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight boxing champion, had lain neglected on the table-tops at the 5th floor View Bar at Waterstone’s in Piccadilly.But the audience should have taken a hint from a non sequitur by William Hill’s Graham Sharpe halfway through his speech: “The future of rugby is black.” Presumably, most in his hearing thought it a reference to the All Blacks.Jack Johnson, who once declared: “I’m black all right! I’ll never let them forget it!”, would have been pleased, but not at all surprised.Teddy bareThree years ago, Oliver Holmes, managing director of Merrythought Toys, maker of pricey collectible teddy bears, told the FT: “When everybody else trooped off to the Orient, we stayed on at Ironbridge in Shropshire and we pushed our prices up.”On Monday, though, the picnic was over, as Merrythought, a third-
generation family-owned company and one of the few remaining toymakers in Britain, closed its Ironbridge operation with the loss of 48 jobs.But that is not necessarily the end of the story. Merrythought Toys, which recently changed its name to Smudged, is being put into creditors’ voluntary liquidation (CVL) by its directors. Its main creditor is the parent company, Merrythought, which owns the trademark and intellectual property rights.If a company in a CVL cannot meet its statutory obligations to redundant employees, application can be made for payments to be made from state funds.It would be open for Merrythought to start production elsewhere.In 2003, Holmes said: “Our specialist market cares about where we are made, so to take production abroad would be wrong. It would also be unnecessary as our bears are not price-sensitive. We are staying here.”That was then."
548;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Alliance Boots says integration on track;;Alliance Boots, the newly merged pharmacy chain and drugs wholesale group, on Tuesday said it was on track to deliver savings as expected, but highlighted a number of challenges in the second half.The group, formed from the £8bn merger this year of Alliance Unichem and Boots, reported an 11.5 per cent rise in pro forma interim pre-tax profits to £272m (which included some post tax earnings) and said the integration programme was “continuing according to plan”.Richard Baker, chief executive, said: “We remain confident of being able to deliver the synergies announced at the time of the merger in line with our original plans.””The company reiterated its promise to deliver annual savings of £100m by the fourth full year following completion, with £60m of savings expected to come in the next two years.But it said that during the second half it faced a stronger comparative period for UK retail, the possibility of further government action in France to contain healthcare expenditure, as well as a reduction in reimbursement prices of generic medicines in England and Wales.Richard Chamberlain, retail analyst with Goldman Sachs, said in a research note: “Although the merger process is on track, the market is likely to be disappointed by management’s mere reiteration of its £100m synergy guidance.”Mr Chamberlain added that while the UK retail business continued to trade well, about 1 per cent of like-for-like growth was related to a a one-off benign weather effect.In UK retail, total revenues increased 5.6 per cent to £2.82bn with like-for-like revenues, which strip out the effects of new space, up 4.5 per cent.On a pro forma basis, group revenues rose 2.9 per cent to £7.04bn, with retail revenues up 5.7 per cent to £3.13bn. At the wholesale division, revenues rose 1 per cent to £4.4bn.Group trading profit rose by 2.7 per cent to £267m, while adjusted earnings per share were up 10.4 per cent to 20.1p. Statutory profits on continuing operations, which contain six months of results for the former Boots Group and two months of results for the former Alliance UniChem business, were £156m compared with £282m in the first half of last year which included a one-off gain of £151m from sales and leaseback transactions.The health and beauty business, which comprises the UK operations of Boots the Chemists, saw revenue increase 4.7 per cent to £2.32bn, with like-for-like revenues up 4.1 per cent.The board has not declared an interim dividend as merger dividends covering the period to July 31 were paid to shareholders of each of the predecessor companies on October 3.Alliance Boots said in setting its initial dividend it was targeting dividend cover of 2-2.5 times adjusted earnings.The next scheduled dividend to be proposed will be a final dividend for the year 2006-07 for the period July 31 until March 31.Pro forma pre-tax profits figures were prepared on an adjusted basis, on continuing operations, before non trading items, amortisation of certain acquired intangible assets and IAS 39 timing differences, all net of tax and before exeptional tax credits.Shares were up 1 per cent in early trade at 827½p in London.
549;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2006-11-13T18:27:27Z;Metals worries pull FTSE lower;;"Berkeley Group, the housebuilder focused on London and the south-east, was a key talking point on Monday as its recent remarkable run continued.The stock closed 6.8 per cent stronger at a record high of £17.02, taking its gains over the past six trading sessions to 19 per cent.Traders pinned the advance on takeover rumours, fuelled by last week’s £660m, or 585p-a-share, bid for Crest Nicholson from a consortium headed by financier Tom Hunter. Like Crest, Berkeley is an urban regeneration specialist.However, analysts noted a buyout of Berkeley would require the blessing of 29.1 per cent shareholder Saad Group, a Saudi Arabian investment house. Further, they said it was difficult to see how a bidder could incentivise the company’s management team.“They already have a deal to die for,” said one analyst, referring to the scheme that will see senior executives receive 15 per cent of Berkeley Group if they succeed in returning £12-a-share to investors by the end of 2012.Another analyst attributed the rise to talk the company could speed up the timetable for returning cash. Berkeley reports half-year figures next month.Meanwhile, Crest eased 0.1 per cent to 615p despite indications that institutional shareholders will hold out for a higher offer. Yesterday Scottish Widows revealed
it had bought almost 690,000 shares at 614p after the bid was announced on Friday.The FTSE 100 surrendered early gains to close 14.2 points, or 0.2 per cent, weaker at 6,194.2 – its fourth consecutive session of losses. The index was dragged down by weakness in the heavyweight mining sector, which fell heavily on the back of lower metal prices.In contrast, the FTSE 250 gained 59.2 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 10,712.8 – the fifth day in a row that it has outperformed the FTSE 100.Of the ten biggest blue chip fallers yesterday, eight were mining stocks. The hardest hit were Antofagasta, down 5.3 per cent to 468¼p, and Kazakhmys, off 5 per cent to £11.40, as the copper price fell to a five-month low. Elsewhere, Xstrata drifted back 4.5 per cent to £21.92, while Rio Tinto lost 4 per cent to £27.65.Heading in the opposite direction was Resolution, which climbed 5.1 per cent to 667½p after the life assurer revealed it was in talks over a number of potential deals.Traders suggested that Resolution might look to merge with either Scottish Widows, the life assurance division of Lloyds TSB, 1 per cent stronger to 561p, or the UK life arm of Prudential, 2.1 per cent higher at 651½p. However, broker Keefe, Bruyette & Woods took a different view and said a deal with Friends Provident, up 1.3 per cent to 214¼p, was more likely.“We believe Friends Provident management would be open-minded about selling its back-book in exchange for a controlling stake in Resolution; there would be significant asset management and administration cost synergies,” it said.Elsewhere, bid rumours continued to swirl around Experian, the credit checking company that was recently demerged from GUS. Earlier this year, GUS was reported to have turned down a £7bn bid from private equity groups Thomas H Lee and Bain for Experian. The shares rose 2.3 per cent to 599½p.Alliance Boots rose 0.7 per cent to 819p as traders squared positions ahead of this morning’s maiden half-year figures.Jardine Lloyd Thompson, the insurance broker, was among the FTSE 250’s biggest fallers after Merrill Lynch downgraded to “sell”, citing valuation and the difficult trading environment for commercial brokers.Northern Foods eased 4.2 per cent to 86p on fears that today’s half-year numbers could disappoint.Elsewhere, Amec, the engineering group, rose 3.8 per cent to 415p after admitting it had rebuffed a takeover approach from private equity groups First Reserve and Texas Pacific.Carillion gained 3.3 per cent to £4 excited by the move on Amec.Rumoured takeover target Northumbrian Water added 1.3 per cent to 316p after Morgan Stanley said it was the cheapest UK water stock and the most likely to receive a bid."
550;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2006-08-29T12:55:56Z;Barrett to bow out at Barclays?;;August 29: Hi - hope you all had a good long weekend. We kick off the week with the news that Matt Barrett is apparently about to retire as chairman of Barclays. This would be good news.Barclays is thrashing around in search of a strategy: a little investment in India here, a bit in South Africa there. At home Barclays is trying to make up for the disaster which was the Woolwich acquisition and for which Barrett, 61, and chief executive John Varley, are largely to blame. And it is not hard to see the potential for hugely destructive tension among the bank’s senior executives which would need firm refereeing.As the former CEO and one of the main architects of much of this, Barrett is in no position to oversee a clarification of strategy or to keep the peace in the boardroom. The Times and Daily Mail this morning suggested that Marcus Agius, chairman of Lazard in London and former chairman of BAA, is most likely to be chosen for the job. He would bring clarity of thought and a no-nonsense management style which would enable him to impose discipline and rigour at Barclays. He could also be expected to cast a sceptical eye over the activities of Barclays Capital, which would be no bad thing.Sir Nigel Rudd, the deputy chairman who has been on the board since 1996, was once considered a possible chairman but, as he is already chairman of Alliance Boots, the corporate governance police would take a dim view of this. And since he joined the board 10 years ago, the same people might not consider him sufficiently independent. The other name being suggested is Bob Steel, a former Goldman Sachs banker who joined the board last year. It’s hard to say what his chances are, however.Yet more trouble for BP: the Wall Street Journal says the company is being investigated for possible manipulation of the crude oil and unleaded gasoline markets. A spokesman is cited in the Journal and on Bloomberg saying the company is aware of the investigations and is co-operating with them.Another company seems to have found accounting irregularities. This time it is St Ives, the printer used across the City and by many companies for their official documents. The shares are off a fifth.We also have first-half results from Antofagasta, benefiting from high copper prices, CRH and Bunzl.Apax and KKR have confirmed they are not going to proceed with a bid for Signet.To make or read a comment click here.For previous blogs, click here
551;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2006-08-18T17:22:07Z;London higher as media stocks rally;;Media stocks were in focus on Friday as takeover activity in the sector intensified.News that SMG, owner of STV and Virgin Radio, was in merger talks with Ulster Television’s UTV raised hopes of further deals to come.Rumours of a possible bid for GCAP Media, which have been swirling around the market for a day or two, intensified amid speculation that at least three private equity groups had sounded out GCAP shareholders about a possible takeover.Given the weakness in GCAP’s shares, which bottomed out at 184p this month, analysts said a bid of more than 250p a share could be enough to tempt investors.GCAP ended 3.2 per cent higher at 215p while SMG and UTV rose 2.9 per cent to 72p and 7.6 per cent to 344p¼p respectively.In the wider market, the FTSE 100 traded sideways, gaining just 3 points to 5,903.4, although it rose 1.7 per cent over the week.The FTSE 250 fared better, rising 26.4 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 9,513.0, for a weekly gain of 2.8 per cent. Volumes were low all week.News of a multi-billion dollar contract to supply fighter jets to Saudi Arabia sent BAE Systems 2.6 per cent higher to 369½p.InterContinental Hotels Group gained 2.8 per cent to 905p as BNP Exane initiated coverage with a “buy” rating and a hefty £12.85 price target. “Three years of intense restructuring have fundamentally transformed IHG, creating a focused, high-growth, cash-generative, defensive business,” analyst Amandine Latour wrote in a note to clients.BT Group rose 1.7 per cent to 239¾p ahead of a ruling from the European Commission, expected on Monday, that should open up the German broadband internet market to competition.Alliance Boots, the newly-merged chemist group, rose 1 per cent to 777½p as Deutsche Bank repeated its “buy” recommendation and re-minded investors that the Boots advantage card was carried by 15m Britons, which is 2m more than the number of Tesco clubcards in circulation.Royal & Sun Alliance rose 0.4 per cent to 132½p as Morgan placed 17m shares in the insurer at 132p each.Imperial Tobacco jumped 2.2 per cent to £18.18 as the end of long-running tobacco legislation in the US raised hopes of a bid for the owner of the Golden Virginia brand. JPMorgan Cazenove said that the ruling – a court declined to fine US tobacco giants Altria and Reynold American despite finding them guilty of violating federal racketeering laws – increased the chance that Altria’s Philip Morris division would make a move for Imperial once, as expected, it is demerged from Kraft Foods.However, surprise news that China had raised interest rates weighed on mining stocks amid fears the move could affect demand from the country. Kazakhstan-based Kazakhmys was the worst hit, falling 2.3 per cent to £12.09.PartyGaming lost 2.2 per cent to 111p as ABN Amro downgraded the gambling group from “buy” to “hold” to reflect regulatory risk and dollar weakness. Vodafone closed down 0.4 per cent at 110p having hit a four-year low of 108½p earlier in the session.In the mid-caps, Carphone Warehouse lost 1.7 per cent to 266¾p as Citigroup initiated coverage with a “sell” rating and warned that increased competition for broadband internet users meant the market would get “increasingly crowded and uncomfortable”.Interserve, down 1.6 per cent to 290p, continued to slide following this week’s discovery of accounting irregularities. However, broker Charles Stanley said that the issued obscured otherwise strong trading at the company and repeated its ”buy” recommendation.Sub-prime lenders rose as proposals from the Competition Commission to boost competition in the industry stopped short of imposing a price cap. Market leader Provident Financial rose 6.8 per cent to 631p, further boosted by a “buy” note from Citigroup.Tomkins gained 3.8 per cent to 291¼p as Morgan Stanley upgraded the engineering group to “overweight”.
552;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2006-08-16T17:09:07Z;FTSE flat as ex-dividends weigh;;Ashtead sustained its mini-revival yesterday as buyers continued to pick up stock in a company that lost half its market value in just four months.Aggressively targeted by hedge funds over the summer, the tool hire group’s shares hit a low of 112p earlier this week amid worries about the wisdom of July’s $1bn deal to buy Florida-based NationsRent at a time when the market in the US has been under pressure.A further bear story doing the rounds this week suggested that George Burnett, chief executive, was looking to sell his stake of 12m shares.However, the stock was a leading gainer for the second consecutive day yesterday as Panmure Gordon added its weight to the recovery story. Charlie Cottam, analyst, dismissed talk of Mr Burnett offloading stock and said the non-residential construction market in the US remained healthy.“The market seems to be factoring in a US recession for Ashtead, which looks too harsh,” he told clients in a “buy” note. Ashtead closed up 6.5 per cent at 127¾p, a move that helped mid-cap stocks outperform a static FTSE 100.The blue-chip index ended down 1.3 points at 5,896.6 while the FTSE 250 gained 88.4 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 9,448.0. Volumes were better than they have been of late, with 2.6bn shares traded.Vedanta Resources, up 5.8 per cent to £13.41, led a buoyant mining sector higher amid a flurry of takeover speculation and a record high for nickel. While consolidation remained a hot topic in the sector, India-based Vedanta has never been viewed as a obvious target. Any sale would hinge on the 54 per cent holidng of Anil Agarwal, executive chairman, who is not though to be ready to sell the company he founded.The ever volatile PartyGaming jumped 4.6 per cent to 108¾p amid vague talk of further aquisitions.Alliance Boots dropped 2.2 per cent to 773½p as Credit Suisse initiated coverage on the merged chemist chain with a 250p price target and said investors had already discounted the synergy benefits and earnings potential of the combined Boots and Alliance UniChem.Power generators clogged the list of blue-chip fallers after British Energy admitted it could miss output goals for 2007. The nuclear power generator fell 4.5 per cent to 718p, while International Power lost 1.8 per cent to 314p, Scottish & Southern Energy softened 1.8 per cent to 314p, National Grid slid 1.1 per cent to £11.15 and Drax Group eased 0.9 per cent to 952½p.Also weighing on the indices was the host of stocks that began trading ex-dividend. They included BT Group, off 3 per cent to 233½p, and Northumbian Water Group, down 3.8 per cent to 256p. Northumbian was also hit by a downgrade from Evolution SecuritiesElswhere in the mid-caps, renewed takeover speculation sent Matalan 3.4 per cent higher to 175¾p. Talk in the market was that majority shareholder and chairman John Hargreaves, who has been given a deadline of September 12 to make an offer for the discount retailer, would pitch his approach at between 180p and 190p a share.Carphone Warehouse rose 5.8 per cent to 269½p as Cazenove upgraded the phone retailer from “underperform” to “in-line“. The shares have lost ground since the group signalled an agressive push into the broadband internet market.Stagecoach gained 1.7 per cent to 117¼p on hopes that the bus operator would announce a return of cash to shareholders at next week’s annual meeting.RPS Group, which has been trading close to all-time highs, firmed up 1 per cent to 224½p as Alan Hearne, chief executive, said he had sold shares in the consultancy worth £1.5m.Morgan Crucible lost 2.1 per cent to 270p amid talk that Morgan Stanley had placing 7.2m shares, equal to about 2.5 per cent of the company, at 272p a share. Dealers questioned the timing of the placing, which comes less than a week after the industrial ceramics group said it had received a takeover approach. Some reasoned that this meant the approach, which the company admitted at the time was “premliminary”, would come to nought.Cable & Wireless lost 0.4 per cent to 123¾p as Desdner Kleinwort cut its rating on the telecoms group from “buy” to “hold”.“We believe it is too soon to buy into the UK-turnaround and we expect currency downgrades to weigh on the stock for the rest of 2006,” the broker said.
553;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2006-08-02T21:03:45Z;Boots on brink of deal with CVS;;"Alliance Boots, the international drug distribution and retail group, could soon be selling its No 7 lipsticks in Florida as it hammers out a deal with CVS, one of the US’s largest pharmacies, to roll out its own-brand ranges across the US.The companies are poised to sign a deal to put the Boots products – such as its Botanics skincare range and its No 7 cosmetics brand – into one-third of CVS’s 6,100 stores.Boots, after some disastrous overseas ventures in Japan and Europe, has focused its US expansion on partnerships with existing retailers, choosing CVS and Target, the discount retailer that has built a reputation for “cheap chic” products and design.It has been in partnership with CVS since 2004 and now has its “shop within a shop” concept in more than 50 stores. It also has product in more than 150 Target
discount stores, supported by a network of “beauty advisers” recruited by Boots.It is not thought that the deal will be affected by the £8bn ($15bn) merger this week of Boots and Alliance UniChem, the European drugs wholesaler.“This started as a stand-alone Boots deal, and is unaffected,” said one insider.The US roll-out is part of Alliance Boots’ wider strategy to put Boots products into a number of different countries.The newly merged Alliance Boots is already adding Boots’ ranges into Alliance’s 1,200-strong pharmacy chain in the UK and could, by the end of the decade, start selling Boots brands through Alliance’s 400-strong chain of pharmacies in Norway, the Netherlands and Italy.It could also use its pan-European wholesale network to supply independent chemists with Soltan suncream and No 7 products.However, Alliance Boots has no plans to enter the wholesale drugs distribution market in the US.Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of the merged company, said this week it would be impossible to get a foothold in the US wholesale market given that 94 per cent of the market is already controlled by three companies.“To go there and be a minnow player would be a kind of suicide,” he said.For CVS, the Boots deal is part of a broader drive to boost its margins through improving its cosmetics and skin care offer.It has struck a similar deal with Finland’s Lumene, a privately owned cosmetics company and has recently set up a US subsidiary to develop closer relations with CVS.Boots confirmed it was in discussions with its partners on Wednesday, declining to
comment further."
554;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2006-07-31T19:17:08Z;New Boots sets a long road to integration;;To comment, visit www.ft.com/lombardThis entente needs monitoring closelyRichard Baker, chief executive of Alliance Boots, sounded as bright as a honeymoon bridegroom during Monday’s presentation to mark the completion of Boots’ merger with Alliance UniChem. As he told those impertinent enough to ask for details of the first night, “the company is only two-and-a-half hours old”. But even if there weren’t many answers, there are still quite a few questions.This was, remember, a “merger of equals” – the kind of deal that sounds like a shared triumph but is often revealed as a common-or-garden takeover within months. Carefully stitched management structures – “you have the chief executive and we’ll have the executive deputy chairman” – are picked apart as the true balance of power is revealed. Shareholders suffer.Alliance Boots’ approach looks conservative – a good thing given the record of some recent retail mergers (Wm Morrison/Safeway, notably). Realising cost savings is the group’s top priority, but the process is starting slowly. Mr Baker batted away a question about staff cuts on Monday: two boards have already been lumped into one but it is “business as usual” for employees. A best-of-both format will be tried out only at a limited number of UK stores. Many analysts still believe it should be comparatively easy to achieve £100m of annual cost savings by the fourth full year. Some think £150m may be attainable.The relationship to watch will be the one between Mr Baker and Stefano Pessina, architect of Alliance UniChem, major shareholder and the man responsible for integration and strategy. Mr Pessina on Monday hinted at further acquisitions, at the right price. Boots’ old investors, only just getting used to the new first-name (pronounced, French-style, “a-lee-ons”), may not welcome the prospect of lower dividends and further expansion. It is certainly a reason for them to monitor the happy couple’s first year with the alert scepticism of crotchety in-laws.War on fraudIn a robust article in Monday’s FT, Michael Snyder, a top City official, warned that the Square Mile risked becoming “a honeypot for white-collar criminals”. Coincidentally, Ed Balls, economic secretary to the Treasury, threw his weight behind the parallel campaign against money-laundering on Monday, launching consultation on forthcoming European legislation to fight the problem.Mr Snyder, chairman of the City’s policy and resources committee, posed a difficult question in his article: “Why is it that offences related to money-laundering carry a 14-year maximum prison term, but fraud just 10?” The simple answer is that the crimes supported by money-laundering – terrorism, not to mention drug-running, people-trafficking and prostitution – are far more heinous than financial fraud.That explains why the government has been more vocal about money-laundering and has imposed a series of checks that have added to the compliance costs of financial institutions in the City and beyond. Mr Balls says all the right things about the need to reduce the burden of money-laundering regulation on business, but the reality is that it remains too heavy.The indiscriminate bureaucratic paperchase after potential money-launderers risks distracting the City’s private and public enforcers from the targeted prevention, detection and punishment of fraud – a crime that, if left unchecked, poses a great threat to the City’s reputation.Of course, the bigger the honeypot, the more wasps it is likely to attract. But in trying to prevent the unthinkable, the authorities risk letting the merely unacceptable flourish.When smaller is saferDeal bankers are notorious for passing over the details in favour of the big picture. Little wonder, then, that in the recent merger boom they have tended to focus on deal value – which in the UK is at its highest in the year to date since 2000 – and omitted to mention that deal volume is falling off, according to Dealogic, the global data provider. One reason may be that chief executives are again spurning smaller deals in favour of big, transformational transactions that take them to the next stage of growth. The same goes for buy-out firms, which are shying away from the sort of £1bn to £2bn purchases that have propped up volume in recent years. Instead, like their strategic counterparts, the financial buyers are targeting scale. This can be risky. The last period when the average value of UK deals was so consistently high was just before the dotcom bubble burst. The aftermath of those bids punctured chief executives’ hubris but left some companies with bloated balance sheets and unfocused strategies. Now may be the time for clever buyers to seek out instead smaller bolt-on deals that allow companies to grow at minimal risk of later indigestion.Deals: lina.saigol@ft.com and andrew.hill@ft.comTo comment, visit www.ft.com/lombarddan.roberts@ft.com

556;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Tesco suffers brain drain from top ranks;;Tesco, the UK’s No 1 supermarket group, is facing a brain drain among its top managers amid competition from rivals J Sainsbury and Asda.Tesco, which this week is expected to come out as the supermarket winner over Christmas with underlying sales growth of at least 5.5 per cent, has lost three senior people over recent months.The latest to defect is Andy Coleman, who will join J Sainsbury as a zone managing director in the next couple of months. The 32-year-old was earmarked to become an operations director at Tesco, putting him in the retailers’ elite bunch of top 50 managers, before he resigned.Meanwhile, Asda, owned by Wal-Mart of the US, has just welcomed Darren Blackhurst – also one of Tesco’s top brass – to its executive board as food trading director. Mr Blackhurst was most recently commercial director for Tesco’s Thai operations and had worked at the retailer for 18 years.Stuart Machin, another senior manager who had been running a number of Tesco stores, has also joined Asda as central operations director.The moves are the latest in a number of departures from Tesco including Scott Wheway, who joined Boots last year as retail director, and Ken McMeikan, who is Sainsbury’s retail director.Mr Wheway has been at Boots for less than a year but is already earmarked for bigger things.He will sit on the board of Alliance Boots if the proposed deal between the retailer and Alliance-UniChem, the pharmacy group, comes to fruition in the coming year.Mr McMeikan, 40, is one of Sainsbury’s top 10 managers and sits on the operating board. Tesco said: “We appoint thousands of managers and hundreds of directors and this sort of movement work both ways, we appoint from other retailers and grow our own people. We have plenty of strong talent in the business.”But rival operators think that while the steady and consistent leadership of Sir Terry Leahy, chief executive, has made Tesco the seemingly unassailable market leader in the UK, the lack of movement in top echelons of management has proved frustrating for some of the company’s younger talent. The most recent board appointment was Richard Brasher nearly two years ago. The rest of the top five team have been there for at least seven years.Many in the industry think there will be a growing number of defections over the coming year to Sainsbury and Asda.

558;WBA;Walgreens Boots Alliance;2005-10-03T19:08:24Z;Lex: Alliance/Boots;;The unkind could say that, after the Boots/Alliance UniChem deal, Boots shareholders will get no dividend while Alliance shareholders will get no growth. Unfair, as well as unkind, since the deal has some convincing justification. But important caveats must be addressed.The new group will have a ready-made presence in Europe, a strong wholesale business, a large retail network and a respected name. It hopes to increase profits by rebranding the Alliance retail business and expanding into new markets. If successful, shareholders will see growing earnings but lower pay-outs than at Boots, since the new group plans to use its balance sheet to fund acquisitions. Meanwhile, £100m of cost synergies will be worth about £350m to Boots shareholders, the same as the remainder of a share buy-back programme which now seems unlikely to be completed. The synergies are also disappointing. There are few signs of real fat being sliced from Boots, most particularly at its Nottingham headquarters.Indeed, the new group seems to be planning to run two head offices one in London and the other in Nottingham. It also appears to have two heads Richard Baker, the titular chief executive, and Stefano Pessina, the deputy chief executive and largest shareholder. Mr Pessina, in his own words, will be responsible for “integration, acquisitions and strategy”. What this leaves for Mr Baker is moot.There are many reasons why Alliance Boots makes sense. But lack of clarity over its leading characters' roles is one factor obscuring these.
