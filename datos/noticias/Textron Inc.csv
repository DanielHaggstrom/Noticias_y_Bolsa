The segment posted revenue of $1.6bn in the fourth quarter, a 12 per cent gain year-over-year, while its profit jumped 42 per cent to $170m. The results included delivery of 63 business jets, up from 58 a year ago, and 67 commercial turboprop planes, up from 45.Textron also provided 2019 guidance for overall revenue of approximately $14bn, roughly flat with 2018 and below Wall Street’s estimate of $14.6bn. But earnings from continuing operations are projected to hit $3.55 to $3.75 a share, better than the consensus view of $3.49 a share.Shares jumped as much as 8.8 per cent on Thursday morning, before moderating to be 8 per cent higher to $53.10 at pixel time.Aircraft makers have benefited from increased sales of business and private jets in the US, thanks in part to tax reform signed by President Donald Trump in 2017. The tax measure included a lower rate for corporations and deductions related to corporate jets.Textron chief executive Scott Donnelly said the company has seen strong orders across its family of Cessna Citation business jets, creating sequential and year-over-year order growth in each quarter of 2018.“At [Textron] Aviation, we’re projecting continued growth and increased aircraft deliveries across the portfolio including the [Cessna] Longitude and a double-digit operating margin in 2019,” Mr Donnelly added, speaking during a conference call with analysts.A decline in military volume weighed on Textron’s Bell division in the latest quarter. It delivered 46 commercial helicopters, up from 45 in the fourth quarter of 2017, while segment profits and revenue were both down on a year-over-year basis.Textron’s total revenue fell 6.6 per cent to $3.75bn during the quarter ended December 29. Net income was $246m, or $1.02 a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $106m. Adjusted earnings per share rose to $1.15 from 74 cents.Analysts expected Textron to report adjusted earnings of 98 cents a share on revenue of $4bn.Textron’s quarterly results come on the heels of an upbeat 2019 outlook from United Technologies, which also reported strong sales of jet engines and aeroplane parts in the most recent quarter. Chief executive Gregory Hayes said the maker of Pratt & Whitney engines will benefit from “really solid trends in aerospace across the board” and economic strength in the US.
1;TXT;Textron Inc;2016-05-24T05:00:10Z;New stretched jets bring more cabin comfort;As well as making planes go faster and further, leading jet makers are working to enhance the in-flight experience;Superficial similarities between most business jet designs can obscure the reality of continuous change and development. Speed and range are two obvious aspects of an aircraft where advances yield advantages to the business traveller. But going faster and further does not stop passengers wanting to make the best use of their time in the air.Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace group, is working on the launch of stretched versions of its Global series business jet that will offer greater range and cabin comfort.Brad Nolen, Bombardier’s director of product strategies, explains how the Global 7000 and 8000 jets are being built with nonstop flights from North America to Asian locations in mind. Their numeric names refer to their approximate ranges in nautical miles.This push towards longer-range aircraft is being accompanied by an emphasis on greater comfort and more elaborate interiors. One potential configuration for a large Global series jet consists of four different zones, the first of which is reserved for four seats. The other three rooms inside the aircraft can offer a dining room, bedroom and a stateroom.“These aircraft are completely customisable” says Mr Nolen. “They can be set up to equal a boutique hotel that transports itself from Sydney to San Francisco.” Travelling at just below the speed of sound, Mach 0.925, and at very high altitudes up to 51,000 feet, the Global 7000 will be much more than a swanky hotel with wings, according to Mr Nolen.Those wings have been the subject of intensive research and are designed to handle high-speed flight and slow landings via slats and flaps that can configure the wing for approaches to shorter runways.This need for advanced wing technology points to a contradiction that plagues business jet designers. More speed equals shorter journey times, and larger aircraft have the fuel reserves for long-distance flights. But business aviation is about convenience, and the airport closest to the passengers’ final destination may not have the long runway required by larger jets. “We want to increase size and comfort,” says Mr Nolen, “but we also want to be able to fly into the small, challenging airports with short runways.”Aircraft design is about compromises. A swept wing equates to speed and a straight wing allows for slow landings into limited space. With the fuel load necessary to fly 7,000 miles, a jet will need at least 6,000ft of runway to get off the ground, which in turn limits the number of available departure points.Passengers who are airborne for long flights expect to remain in touch, and Bombardier’s Global Series of jets offer satellite-based internet connectivity with enough download capacity to host online meetings or access Netflix.The company’s Challenger 650 jet allows passengers to control the cabin temperature, lighting and window shades using their smartphones. Mr Nolen says all of this convenience is about responding to the need for personal devices to be integrated into the cabin design.“People are streaming media everywhere so we have to integrate that level of connectivity into the aircraft.”Others are competing with Bombardier in developing and enhancing their aircraft. Textron is the group that includes classic US aviation names such as Cessna and Beechcraft. It manufactures the long-established King Air twin turboprop that covers shorter distances. In its latest iterations, the King Air offers WiFi in its small cabin and incorporates touchscreen displays to lower the pilot workload.People are streaming media everywhere so we want that level of connectivity on boardRoomier cabin space in its mid-range jets is also on the agenda for Textron, which believes that in-flight meeting space demanding greater cabin height and width should not be restricted to longer-range aircraft.The larger models in its Citation range reflect what Kriya Shortt, senior vice-president for sales and marketing, says is a customer demand for improved working environments that “allows people to be more effective while they are on board”.Flexjet, the fractional ownership business, has improved the odds on a supersonic business jet taking to the skies by placing a $2.4bn order for 20 Aerion AS2 aircraft.The AS2 is yet to fly and has no shortage of critics, who point to the substantial technical challenges involved in sustained supersonic flight, the large associated development costs and apparently limited market for such an exotic machine.Michael Silvestro, chief executive of Flexjet, is undeterred. “There is no question that building and operating a supersonic business jet will not be easy, but we’ve spent a lot of time with Aerion and so far we are confident they can pull this off.”He talks about taking delivery of this aircraft, which is designed to fly at speeds up to Mach 1.5, by 2024.Mr Silvestro hopes that the relatively small size of the AS2 will prevent supersonic booms from reaching populations on the ground and hence the jet will be able to negotiate the restrictions that limited Concorde to supersonic flight over the sea.The potential gains in time offered by boosting jet speeds beyond the sound barrier will appeal to Flexjet’s customers, Mr Silvestro says, adding: “Time is much more valuable to executives than it was a generation ago.”
2;TXT;Textron Inc;2016-05-24T05:00:10Z;How aircraft makers cater for military and defence users;World defence ministries’ demand for business jets has surged with changes in modern warfare;"During the Dubai air show in November, the United Arab Emirates’ defence ministry announced it was buying two surveillance aircraft from Saab of Sweden in a deal valued at $1.27bn. The news was a surprise, but one aspect attracted little comment: the aircraft selected to fly Saab’s radar equipment was not military, but a Bombardier Global 6000 business jet.“Our radars have been integrated on many platforms,” Hakan Buskhe, chief executive of Saab, told reporters following the announcement. “The platform itself is extremely important for endurance, and the capability of using these types of sensors.”It is not just corporate executives who fuel demand for today’s business aviation fleets. The combination of range, reliability, easy maintenance and comparative affordability has put business jets on the inventories of several of the world’s defence forces. They are often used to transport VIPs, but are increasingly being deployed in air-ambulance and surveillance roles.Civilian platforms have long been the backbone of military fleets. The venerable and distinctive Awacs surveillance aircraft — a jet with a large rotating radar antenna attached to the top of the fuselage, operated by the US, the UK, France, and Saudi Arabia among others — is a modified Boeing 707. The Awacs was itself a successor to a similar system installed on a piston-engined Lockheed Constellation airliner. The RAF’s Nimrod R1 and MR2 fleets — which gathered electronic intelligence and maritime data respectively — were both built around modified de Haviland Comet jets.The move to fielding reconnaissance equipment on smaller aircraft began in the middle of the 20th century. Since then, the market has surged after the increasing use of unmanned aircraft in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts fuelled a growing appetite for high-resolution streamed video.Beechcraft’s King Air range of utility turboprop aircraft, developed in the 1960s, were popular with military users. Today the type remains in service with dozens of military forces, with different antennas, camera turrets, bubble windows and other modifications.Although it is third-party suppliers of surveillance or other equipment who usually carry out the modifications, aircraft manufacturers are not just providing an off-the-shelf product. Modification and maintenance work adds considerably to sales and profits. Several manufacturers have established business divisions to cater for the surveillance, inspection, air ambulance and utility markets, usually known collectively as “special missions”.Textron Aviation’s special mission division employs more than 70 people. Tom Hammoor, president of the defence side of Textron Aviation, which owns aircraft brands including Cessna and Beechcraft, says significant work is done on these niche modifications, so that customers will not have to wait or pay for safety certifications for a particular pod, camera turret or internal equipment configuration.Business jets are also increasingly popular for military reconnaissance roles. Pressurised cabins permit operating at altitude limits for normal airliners, which means greater range for optical or radar sensors; the fuel efficiencies and long flight durations expected by the business user are also prized by the military.The RAF’s Sentinel R1 is a Bombardier Global Express aircraft with a bespoke radar sensor and three computer workstations on board: it is able to monitor the movement of vehicles on land and to take radar imagery through cloud. Since entering service in 2008, the Sentinel was used during Nato’s air campaign over Libya and also deployed over Afghanistan.The fleet of five aircraft were modified by contractor and radar manufacturer Raytheon. The aircraft’s success in such a wide variety of operations has piqued interest abroad, and Raytheon is in discussion with international customers to sell similar systems installed on business jet platforms. Enhancements to the UK’s configuration make adding more analyst workstations and new sensors possible."
3;TXT;Textron Inc;2015-11-16T17:08:29Z;Aviation industry outlook remains cloudy;Manufacturers’ conflicting messages reflect mixed fortunes;For anyone seeking to understand the state of the business jet market, the three weeks at the end of April and start of May were a confusing time.On April 29, Phebe Novakovic, chief executive of General Dynamics, expressed cautious but unmistakable optimism about prospects for the US aerospace and defence company’s Gulfstream business jet operation as she discussed its first-quarter results.“We always pull production down in the face of weak orders,” she said. “We have no intention of doing so this year.”On May 14, however, Canada’s Bombardier, which in January had stopped work on its new Learjet 85 corporate jet, made it clear Ms Novakovic’s optimism was not universally shared. Weak demand was forcing it to cut production of its biggest, most expensive aircraft — the Global 5000 and Global 6000.“We have seen an industry-wide softness in demand recently in certain international markets and are taking steps to adjust our production accordingly,” Éric Martel, the then president of Bombardier Business Aircraft, said.The conflicting messages partly reflect how mixed 2015 has been for business aircraft makers. Teal Group, a Virginia-based aerospace consultancy, predicts that 713 business jets will be delivered during 2015. Although the figure is an improvement on the 672 delivered in 2012, it is a slight fall from the 722 delivered in 2014 and highlights how far the industry is from again hitting the record 1,318 delivered in 2008.The picture has also been different for companies serving different parts of the world and in different size categories. Deliveries at the top end of the size range have held remarkably steady throughout the economic downturn. Gulfstream is projected this year to deliver 115 of its largest-cabin jets — the G450, G550 and G650 — down slightly from 117 last year. Bombardier’s production of its flagship Global 5000 and 6000 is set to fall to 68, from 80 in 2014.Chad Anderson, president of JetCraft, a North Carolina-based private jet broker, says the strength in big aircraft reflects the growing number of companies that need long-range, fast jets to visit locations across the globe.“More often than not, our clients’ business demands have globalised, not shrunk,” Mr Anderson says. “That has required a lot more capable aeroplanes in terms of range requirements.”$5.4bnCost to Bombardier of building the C Series so farIt is less clear, however, whether a recovery in midsize jets — anticipated since demand collapsed during the economic crisis in 2008 — will be sustained, even if there are optimistic signs. Cessna is due to deliver 170 aircraft this year in its midsize Citation range, up 7 per cent on 2014. That segment has benefited from robust economic recovery in the US, the biggest market for business jets.“There’s still an intra-continental requirement for some users,” Mr Anderson says. “North American users who still have local requirements can very well utilise the midsize and light jet aircraft.”The smallest light-jet segment, which was once expected to boom as a series of manufacturers launched very cheap models, looks set to remain a modest part of the market. JetCraft says very light, light and superlight jets will account for only $25bn of the $271bn revenue that it projects the industry will earn from new jets up to the end of 2024.Alain Bellemare, Bombardier’s chief executive, cited the “very soft” market for smaller jets as the reason for cancelling the midsize Learjet 85 programme altogether, after the project was initially put on hold in January.The whole industry’s prospects, meanwhile, have been further clouded by the sharp falls in the price of oil and other commodities, and the poor performance of European and emerging market economies that had produced many of the industry’s recent orders.Scott Donnelly, chief executive of Textron, Cessna’s parent, told investors during the third-quarter earnings call that he was “reasonably happy” with the US market for business jets.713Number of business jets likely to be delivered in 2015But he went on: “There’s no question that the markets in Europe and Asia are challenged. I think part of that is just the economies are in a pretty difficult spot. Of course, the US dollar being quite strong puts some additional pressure on that in terms of all the product lines.”Yet an important dynamic in the market, one critical in understanding Bombardier’s take on market conditions, relates to the plight of Bombardier, which manufactures more business jets than any other and is projected to have 32.2 per cent of the market this year by revenue.The company faces a serious corporate crisis as it struggles to fund the costs — $5.4bn so far — of developing its C Series commercial jet, a competitor to Airbus’s A320 family and Boeing’s 737.Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Teal Group, says the crisis — which pushed net debt up to $6.8bn at the end of the third quarter — prompted Bombardier to increase Global 5000 and 6000 production to unsustainable rates in the hope of bringing in cash. “They just got very aggressive about commercial terms, did everything they could to bring in orders,” Mr Aboulafia says.May’s announcement of a scaling-back of production reflected the unsustainability of Bombardier’s earlier production levels rather than wider weakness in demand, says Mr Aboulafia.The flood of new aircraft, many purchased at knockdown prices, has had knock-on effects across the market. Discussing General Dynamics’ third-quarter results, Ms Novakovic referred darkly to “non-macro headwinds” in the third quarter because “a competitor” was selling some aircraft at “very low prices”.“Now, inevitably, that part of the market has problems,” Mr Aboulafia says.Yet Bombardier’s cash crunch is likely to shape the long-term competitive landscape in the industry. The crisis has forced the company to postpone introduction of its long-range Global 7000 and 8000 aircraft by two years.The company is falling behind a wave of innovation. Cessna will show its new midsize Longitude jet at this week’s convention of the US National Business Aviation Association in Las Vegas. Gulfstream is developing the G500 and G600 as new, higher-technology replacements for its existing G450 and G550 models, and as competitors to the Global 5000 and 6000. France’s Dassault Aviation is simultaneously developing its new Falcon 5X and 8X business jets.Mr Anderson expects that the loyalty of Bombardier customers will ensure that it retains a substantial market share. JetCraft projects that the company will still take 30 per cent of industry revenues in 2024.However, Bombardier’s slow development of its biggest, newest aircraft has prompted a rash of speculation that rivals will develop big, new aircraft to take on Gulfstream’s leadership of the lucrative luxury of the market. Cessna may unveil plans for a longer-range Longitude at NBAA, while Dassault may eventually, observers believe, produce an aircraft able to fly 7,000 nautical miles without refuelling, as the G650 can.While Bombardier may continue to deliver more aircraft and bring in more revenue than its rivals, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that a gradual shift in the industry’s leadership is under way.
4;TXT;Textron Inc;2015-11-10T05:02:46Z;Aerospace and automotive: high flyers and crash landings;The difference between success and failure is defined by whether products meet customers’ needs;"In a hangar belonging to business jet maker Gulfstream on the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia, aircraft in varying states of assembly sit nose to tail, workers bustling around them. By the time the twin-engine G650s reach the front of the hangar they are nearly ready to be flown to their customers. The aircraft, which can fly 7,500 nautical miles non-stop as the extended-range (ER) version, cost up to $66.5m for the ER — and demand is buoyant. The company is due to manufacture 115 of the top-end jets this year, and orders are rolling in faster than Gulfstream’s workers can build them.In Wichita, Kansas, 1,200 miles to the west, the production line for Hawker, a manufacturer of smaller corporate jets, has been silent since shortly after its then parent, Hawker Beechcraft — an amalgam of two companies from the early days of powered flight — entered bankruptcy in 2012. Hawker proved incapable of operating sustainably in the same business conditions that have produced buoyant demand for Gulfstream.The two groups’ contrasting fortunes reflect many of the factors that determine whether companies in aerospace — and another capital-intensive manufacturing sector, the auto industry — survive or perish. Gulfstream has flourished because the G650 has features customers want — particularly its range — and can find on no other aircraft. Hawker Beechcraft failed to differentiate itself in a crowded field and invested heavily in developing aircraft with carbon composite fuselages, which commanded an insufficient premium for the costlier, lighter material.Development projects in the auto industry tend to be on a smaller scale than in aerospace, but similarly critical. It was because they devoted too little capital to product development that the US’s big three carmakers — General Motors, Ford and Chrysler — failed in the past decade to compete effectively with overseas rivals’ products in the US. On the other hand, many analysts attribute the failure of Germany’s Volkswagen to compete well in the US market in recent years to its failure to develop products in step with US consumers’ tastes.Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a Virginia-based think-tank, explains the risks with reference to Boeing, one of the duopoly that dominates the world market for commercial jets. The company has broken more ground than most rivals, building a pioneering turboprop aircraft, the first modern jetliner and the 747 jumbo jet.Each time Boeing innovated with a new plane, it ended up betting the companyBut Thompson adds: “Each time Boeing innovated with a plane, a new product, it ended up betting the company. If the bet had gone wrong, Boeing would have gone the same way as the Glenn L Martin Company, one of the pioneers of jet aviation.” (Founded in 1912, Martin merged with a building products and chemicals company in 1961.)The risks are so complex, says Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Virginia-based Teal Group, an aerospace market research firm, that successful companies generally need a degree of luck. In the US automotive business in recent years, for example, recovering manufacturers have been buoyed by one of the longest, strongest sales recoveries on record.Among the makers of big business jets, Gulfstream had the good fortune to face a competitor that was distracted. For much of the past decade, Canada’s Bombardier — traditionally the market leader, ahead of Gulfstream and France’s Dassault — has been preoccupied by the costly and time-consuming process of trying to break into the narrow-body commercial jet market with its C Series aircraft. The process has delayed development of Bombardier’s Global 7000 and 8000 jets, planned competitors for the G650. The company has “shot itself in the foot with the C Series”, Thompson says.It was Hawker Beechcraft’s misfortune to have been operating in a more competitive field, which included the jet business of industry pioneer Cessna, Bombardier’s mid-size Learjet aircraft and Brazil’s Embraer. It was still more unfortunate that Embraer proved to be “aggressive and extremely good”, says Aboulafia. “It basically took [Hawker’s] market share.” Hawker Beechcraft’s fall from grace was complete in 2014 when was it bought by Textron, Cessna’s parent.Carmakers can mitigate risk by developing common platforms for vehicles with different bodies that can be introduced worldwide. The smaller volumes in aerospace, however, make the calculations different. Boeing, the biggest aerospace company in the US by sales, is still accumulating losses on its groundbreaking 787 carbon-composite long-haul jet, whose development took far longer and cost far more than intended. Rival Airbus has yet to recoup the development costs of its A380 super-jumbo, which has proved less attractive to airlines than expected.When other European aerospace companies were joining forces in the company now called Airbus, Fokker of the Netherlands — once one of the world’s most important aircraft manufacturers — stayed proudly aloof. But that position proved uncomfortable in an increasingly consolidated industry. Fokker tried co-operating with McDonnell Douglas (since taken over by Boeing) with little success. The company sought to develop two new aircraft — the Fokker 50 and Fokker 100 — but faced mounting costs that forced it to seek a government bailout in 1987. Fokker limped on, but when its strategic partner, Germany’s Dasa, cut off funding in 1996, it was almost immediately declared bankrupt and went out of the aircraft manufacturing business. Other parts of the company were bought and lived on, from 2010 as Fokker Technologies — which in October was acquired by GKN Aerospace.Tom Enders, Airbus’s chief executive, told the Financial Times in 2013 that both companies had got “carried away” in the past after trying to introduce new technologies that turned out not to be “as mature as they should be”.Hawker Beechcraft invested heavily in developing carbon-composite fuselages for its Premier I business aircraft and subsequently the Hawker 200. While the Gulfstream G650 features some composites, its fuselage and wings are predominantly traditional aluminium.Aboulafia sums it up: “Hawker Beechcraft said, ‘Composites are the future; people will pay for composites.’ Gulfstream said, ‘We just don’t see that at all; we’re not in the business of developing technology for technology’s sake.’”The calculations involved are similar to those in the auto industry over whether to abandon steel for some vehicle bodies in favour of aluminium. Ford last year took the audacious decision to launch an aluminium-bodied version of its F-150 pick-up truck — the F-Series accounts for the majority of its worldwide operating profits. Other carmakers are following its lead.The differing approaches of Gulfstream and Hawker Beechcraft meant they entered the economic downturn — when demand for Hawker’s midsize jets collapsed — in very different conditions. Hawker’s problems were exacerbated by the reluctance of its owners, a consortium of investment bank Goldman Sachs and Onex, a private equity firm, to provide more capital.There are similar lessons from the fate of Fokker, the Dutch commercial aircraft maker, whose costs for simultaneously developing two new models — the Fokker 100 and Fokker 50 — ran out of control. The company went bankrupt in 1996.Bombardier faces a markedly similar crisis after costs for developing its C Series ballooned from an initially projected $3.4bn to $5.4bn and introduction to service slipped from 2013 to a date currently set for early next year.When car sales collapsed in 2008, Chrysler faced an especially intense crisis because it was owned by Cerberus, a private equity firm with limited appetite to commit more capital. Alone among the big three US carmakers, Ford avoided going into bankruptcy protection largely because in 2006 it had expanded its borrowing capacity to $25bn to prepare for a potential slowdown.Historically, Chrysler’s position as third-largest of the US’s big three carmakers, after General Motors and Ford, has meant it has struggled to achieve scale and market reach. That prompted an ill-fated expansion into Europe in the 1960s. Then, in 1998, it merged with Germany’s Daimler, whose sale of Chrysler in 2007 to Cerberus, a private-equity firm, left the company vulnerable just as the US market neared one of its biggest-ever slumps. Chrysler had to seek bankruptcy protection in 2009 and was bought by Italy’s Fiat in 2011, but the debt-laden group is seeking yet another merger to secure its future.The lesson of these cases is to “have a home with deep pockets”, Aboulafia says — as Gulfstream, owned by General Dynamics, the military contractor, does.“When Hawker Beechcraft went under, it was owned by private equity, who were getting tired of not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,” he says. “For Gulfstream, if there are bad times now, it is owned by General Dynamics.”Yet the importance of the aerospace and the auto industries — the scale of the projects, the numbers of jobs they generate and the risks involved — means, according to Thompson, that a non-commercial relationship can also be critical. Company after company when facing tough financial times has turned to its government. The US and Canadian governments extended lending to Chrysler and invested heavily in GM to ensure they continued to operate.In aerospace, that relationship is most obviously vital for companies making military aircraft. Lockheed Martin of the US, for example, is the world’s biggest military contractor in part because the US government decided to supply its air force, navy and marines with variants of a single fighter aircraft, the F-35. Lockheed Martin won the contract to build the aircraft.Involvement goes beyond the military, however. Airbus owes its existence to European governments’ decisions in the late 1960s and early 1970s to bring together their national aerospace industries to work collectively. Boeing has regularly turned to the US military for orders at times when commercial orders have been weak.To survive, large companies occasionally have to turn to the government for helpMeanwhile, Bombardier could be about to write a new chapter in its story. Having failed to persuade Airbus to buy a majority stake in the C Series, the company looks to have few alternatives to seeking help from Quebec’s provincial government. Bombardier is reported to have approached the province’s Caisse de dépôt et placement investment fund about a potential cash injection.Such a move would be no surprise to Thompson. “It’s a myth that large industrial companies survive indefinitely without occasionally turning to the government for help,” he says. “They look wherever they must in order to survive hard times.”"

Despite earnings falling 21 per cent, the handbag retailer comfortably beat analysts’ expectations, reporting earnings per share of 15 cents, ahead of the 10.5 cents forecast by the market.“We have made meaningful progress but know our turnround will take time,” said Robert Wallstrom, chief executive, in a statement.Website builder Wix.com jumped 4.3 per cent to $19.72 on an upgrade to buy from Deutsche Bank, which pointed to “significant potential for margin expansion” and set a target price of $27.Camera-maker GoPro fell sharply after a key supplier disappointed on its outlook for the third quarter.Ambarella, which makes semiconductors for cameras, said late on Tuesday that third-quarter wearable camera revenues would be down sequentially and year over year.The outlook reflected the “the substantial build of newly released and existing products in Q2 of this year by GoPro and Xiaomi rather than in Q3 as occurred in the prior years”, said George Laplante, chief financial officer, on an earnings call.Its shares fell 8.5 per cent to $81.98. Go Pro, which floated last year at $24 a share, shed 5.5 per cent to $41.28.Netflix dropped 0.3 per cent to $105.4 as rival Hulu said it would let users pay to skip ads.The announcement came two days after Netflix, which does not have adverts, said it would not renew a licensing deal that allowed it to carry blockbuster titles such as Hunger Games: Catching Fire.Dollar Tree continued to suffer after missing market expectations on Tuesday, dropping 2.9 per cent to $67.59.H & R Block, which prepares tax returns, led the S&P up as investors piled in after Tuesday’s announcement of a share buyback plan and the sale of its bank. Its shares rose 7.5 per cent to $35.4.
6;TXT;Textron Inc;2015-06-01T14:32:36Z;NetJets replaces chief executive Jordan Hansell;Departure comes as two-year pay stand-off with pilots drags on;NetJets, the corporate jet operator owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, said on Monday that it had parted company with Jordan Hansell, its chairman and chief executive, after a “tumultuous” period.Mr Hansell’s replacement as the head of the group — a pioneer of fractional ownership that allows customers to buy use of a jet for set amounts of time each year — comes as a two-year pay dispute with its pilots drags on.For Berkshire Hathaway, the continuing dispute has marred a record of securing good industrial relations at companies that it acquires. It is also likely to add to shareholders’ concerns that Mr Buffett’s investment vehicle is damaging its reputation as a benign owner.NetJets’ pilots took their case to Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting earlier this year, staging a protest outside for better pay and conditions.NetJets on Monday said it was promoting Adam Johnson, a long-term company executive, to replace Mr Hansell. In a statement, Mr Johnson said: “For his hard work and his success in leading NetJets through a very tumultuous economic period, Jordan has earned our sincerest thanks and best wishes for his next endeavours.”Even during the US economic recovery, companies have been slow to resume their use of the smaller corporate jets in which NetJets and rivals such as FlexJet specialise. Demand has remained far stronger for larger corporate jets such as Bombardier’s Global 5000 and 6000, which save executives considerable time by flying at high speeds on long, intercontinental journeys.Operators of these aircraft typically own them rather than using fractional ownership operators.Last year, NetJets’ hours flown were still short of the total for 2007 — the last year before the economic slump.CitationAir, the fractional ownership operation of Cessna, the aircraft manufacturer that is part of Textron, ceased all operations on October 31 last year, owing to tough market conditions.Mr Johnson will be the fourth chief executive of NetJets since Berkshire Hathaway bought the company in 1998 — an unusually high level of turnover for an owner that normally plans its chief executives’ transitions carefully.NetJets also said it had reappointed Bill Noe, its former president and chief operating officer who had left in April, to his previous role.Mr Noe said he had left NetJets for a “can’t say no” opportunity. But he added: “The only thing that could have caused me to reconsider that decision was the chance to return to the company where I’ve worked for 22 years in a role that touches every department, every function and which lets me have a direct impact on our future success.”
7;TXT;Textron Inc;2015-03-12T19:56:51Z;Weak demand sends Sikorsky spinning;Fate of X2 sums up much about the market for military helicopters;In the skies over Florida five years ago, a remarkable-looking Sikorsky helicopter marked an aviation milestone. Fitted with two rotor blades — one on top of the other and spinning in different directions — the Sikorsky X2 reached a speed of 250 knots (288mph), faster than any previous helicopter. The innovative engineering of the two opposing sets of rotors was key to the feat.Yet, five years on, the X2 has been retired and its fate sums up much about the market for military helicopters, which for most of the past decade provided a steady, profitable stream of orders for Sikorsky and its rivals.The western military market is now in a downturn, and this is a factor behind plans unveiled this week by United Technologies Corporation, the elevator and aircraft engine maker, to spin off Sikorsky, its helicopter business.Modernisation programmes for the helicopter fleets of the US army and marine corps — the world’s two most important customers for rotorcraft — have been shelved because of budget cuts and the wind down of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.“The basic problem with the US helicopter market is that the leading customer, the US military, lacks the funding to modernise,” Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, says. “Sikorsky has made a series of bets on future military rotorcraft but, at the moment, the army and the marine corps simply don’t have enough money to buy many helicopters.”Meanwhile, helicopter orders from energy companies — which for several years filled the gap created by declining military sales — have fallen off sharply after the oil price plunge since last summer made expensive offshore oil exploration and production less attractive.This combination of weak military and civilian demand for helicopters has forced Greg Hayes, UTC’s new chief executive, to recognise a longstanding issue, according to Richard Aboulafia, analyst at the Virginia-based Teal group. While other UTC businesses — such as Pratt & Whitney, the aerospace engine maker — supply kit to outside companies that fit the equipment into a finished product, Sikorsky is alone in the group as a systems integrator.“For a while it was growing at double-digit rates,” Mr Aboulafia says, referring to the military market’s average 10.3 per cent worldwide growth rate between 2003-08. “That’s ended — so what’s the rationale for keeping [Sikorsky]?” UTC’s shares rose 2 per cent to $120.5 in early afternoon trading in New York.The challenge for UTC may be that the factors that have led the group to push to dispose of Sikorsky are also ones that make it unattractive to a new owner. There are also likely to be substantial regulatory concerns about a sale to a direct competitor. Sikorsky’s main rivals in supplying the US military are Boeing, manufacturer of Chinook heavy lift helicopters, and Textron, whose Bell Helicopter unit supplies the UH-1Y — the latest version of the “Huey” rotorcraft famous from the Vietnam war — to the US marines.“The US army’s failure to put together a coherent modernisation programme is now resulting in shrinkage of its supplier base,” Mr Thompson says, pointing out that several smaller suppliers — including Exelis and Harris — have announced plans to merge.Mr Hayes went out of his way on Wednesday to stress that UTC would consider a sale of Sikorsky to a foreign buyer. Among the potential candidates are AgustaWestland, the joint venture of Italy’s Finmeccanica and the UK’s GKN, and Airbus, the European aerospace group that already manufactures a few helicopters for the US military.UTC believes in conglomerate cross-subsidisationContinue readingHowever, given that Sikorsky has recently won US contracts for both a rescue helicopter for downed air crew and the presidential rotorcraft, it could be difficult to win clearance for a foreign owner. “The hard part is, ‘Who the hell is the buyer?’” Mr Aboulafia says of the next stage in the process.The likelihood, consequently, is that Sikorsky will end up — for at least a while — as an independent company with a stock market listing or owned by private equity firms. It will continue dependably to earn revenue from longstanding helicopter programmes such as the US army’s Black Hawk. But it will not be able to earn premium returns from know-how such as its ability to develop high-speed helicopters with two rotors like the X2.“For as long as the ability of the armed forces to buy new helicopters is so confined, it will be difficult for them to tell a growth story,” Mr Thompson says.

The machines – which are three-dimensional printers – allow Normal to custom build earphones that fit a buyer’s ears precisely in a couple of days, based solely on photographs.The 3D printing machines at GE Aviation’s low-rise additive technologies laboratory near Cincinnati are similar to those at Normal but are undertaking a far more sensitive task. They are forming, from thin layers of metallic dust, light components for jet engines that will ensure these are far more fuel efficient than previous products made by General Electric, the conglomerate that has a large aerospace division.These contrasting scenes highlight how 3D printing– widely expected to revolutionise some of the world’s most complex types of manufacturing – is starting to become a mainstream technology used across many industries rather than a niche technique for prototype products and highly personalised consumer goods. But as it spreads into safety critical sectors such as aerospace and healthcare, 3D printing is drawing heavy scrutiny from regulators.Proponents of the technology say manufacturers’ problem proving to regulators that printed products are safe is holding back widespread adoption of 3D printing. There is no suggestion the technology is inherently less safe than conventional manufacturing, but US regulators are struggling to decide how to test products.The market for 3D printed products and services is predicted to reach $21bn worldwide by 2020, compared with just $3.1bn last year, according to Wohlers Associates, the consultancy. But the need to satisfy regulators about safety is an “obstacle” to the technology’s advance in certain sectors, according to David Reis, chief executive of Stratasys, manufacturer of more than half the world’s industrial 3D printers, and supplier of printed products to Boeing.“Every part has to go through testing,” says Mr Reis. “Every technology, every material has to go through certification.”Regulators’ concerns stem from how 3D printing is a fundamentally different way of making things compared to conventional manufacturing.Also called additive manufacturing, 3D printing involves building products up in thin layers from their constituent particles of plastic or metal – in contrast to conventional manufacturing, where materials are moulded, pressed or lathed.The issues before regulators include how printed products will behave over time, the consistency of their quality, and the materials used. For example, only 2,000 of the tens of thousands of plastics used in orthodox manufacturing work in 3D printers, so materials have to be changed when switching to the technique.Ed Lowney, head of manufacturing for Custom Control Concepts, which builds tailored interiors for high-end luxury jets, describes 3D printing as a “transformational technology” but says it is hard to win approval from the US Federal Aviation Administration. “The FAA doesn’t mess about,” he adds.Dave Scott, manager for product development at Acist Medical Systems, which makes catheters for coronary artery procedures by 3D printing, says the constraints in his industry come from the US Food and Drug Administration.“It [3D printing] is a process that is difficult to evaluate, because every time you make something it’s different,” he adds. “It doesn’t have the same feeling that you have when you mould something.”Pete Basiliere, an analyst at Gartner, the consultants, says regulators are simply unfamiliar with the issues involved. “The regulators want to make sure [the new product] meets or exceeds the performance characteristics that are being used already,” he adds.In spite of the regulators’ concerns, manufacturers are keen to stick with 3D printing. While the cost per item of printed products is higher than for conventionally-manufactured items, set-up expenses are far lower, meaning the technique is particularly attractive for short production runs.Stratasys estimates one aerospace customer cut 70 per cent of its construction time and reduced costs by 80 per cent when it switched to making cable housings for aircraft by 3D printing, rather than orthodox manufacturing. Many other companies report similarly striking results.The emphasis consequently is on finding ways to satisfy regulators about the safety of printed products.Custom Control Concepts says it has managed the challenges by setting up a testing laboratory at its site approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. It has switched to using Ultem, one of the few 3D printable plastics that the regulator approves as sufficiently fire-resistant for aircraft.“Once you have this material that’s approved, you’ve cut down most of the barriers between you and getting the item on an aeroplane,” says Mr Lowney.GE Aviation, meanwhile, uses “in-process monitoring” during 3D printing to make sure parts meet the required standards. It discards any that fall outside acceptable parameters, and puts every third part through a scanner and X-rays it.“That’s a huge part of the 3D printing technology,” a company spokesman says of this technique. “If you don’t have those, you cannot be sure of the parts you’ve made.”Mr Reis insists that such techniques will in time allow manufacturers to satisfy regulators about safety. “We’re going to have more tools to do the testing faster and it will cause an acceleration of the penetration,” he says.Meanwhile, the regulatory challenges are pushing some manufacturers to concentrate on less safety critical areas. For example, Mr Scott predicts it will be a while before companies make the most sensitive healthcare devices – such as heart valves – by 3D printing.The FAA says it is making efforts to understand the implications of 3D printing in the aerospace industry.The Food and Drug Administration – one of the regulators most intimately involved in the safety issues surrounding the technology – welcomes 3D printing’s potential to create new products custom-shaped to a patient’s body. The regulator, which last month held a workshop on the technology’s use in medical devices, says 3D printing could greatly expand the range of products that are matched to patients’ anatomy.But a spokesman adds: “Because the manufacturing process is very different, devices produced using this technology may require additional or different testing to show safety.”
9;TXT;Textron Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
10;TXT;Textron Inc;2014-10-20T20:01:26Z;Corporate aviation industry hopes next generation of aircraft will encourage sales;Modified engines, wings and controls bring improved efficiency;It is far from obvious visiting General Electric’s sprawling Peebles test site that the work it is undertaking should give hard-pressed chief executives more time with their families.But the GE Passport engine that hangs from one of the testing gantries at the former US military rocket-testing range is designed to give the largest business jets increased range and greater reliability, getting executives to meetings – and home – faster.The Passport will power Bombardier’s new Global 7000 and Global 8000 aircraft, the longest-range and most expensive of a range of new aircraft developed to exploit an expected upswing in business jet demand following the trough since 2008.Pat Gallagher, head of sales for NetJets, which allows customers to buy predetermined slots to use private jets, says the new models will eliminate some of the frustrations users have faced. They are due to enter service this decade.“You used to have to make trade-offs, which might be baggage for passengers, or speed for range, or fuel load for payload,” he says. “The new aircraft are far more capable, with far fewer trade-offs.”Many improvements are thanks to a new generation of engines such as the Passport, which use advanced materials to produce higher pressures and more thrust for a given amount of fuel. Many aircraft also feature more efficient wing designs and new control systems.Shawn O’Day, business aviation marketing manager for GE Aviation, says their fuel efficiency will mean the Global 7000 and 8000 will be able to fly nonstop from New York to Singapore.The Passport is a variant on the Leap engine. This was developed for narrow-body commercial jets by GE’s CFM joint venture with Snecma of France. The Passport is adapted to the rigours of operating at up to 51,000ft, higher than normal commercial jets. It will also feature titanium turbine blades, rather than the Leap’s carbon-fibre ones, because, on the smaller Passport, carbon-fibre blades would be vulnerable to a bird strike.“These aeroplanes are being designed for these very long-range missions,” Mr O’Day says. “We think we’re a big part of that with the technology and design we’re bringing in.”The question is how the new designs are using the improved fuel efficiency made possible by the engines, lighter-weight materials and wing designs.Only the highest-end aircraft are using improved efficiency mainly to prolong the aircraft’s range. The shorter-range Cessna Citation Latitude uses the improved efficiency to provide a larger cabin for up to nine passengers. Textron Aviation, Cessna’s parent has announced that the aircraft would have a 2,700 nautical mile range – 200 miles more than expected – and be able to use shorter runways than expected.“Those great performance announcements . . . coupled with the large cabin are going to make this a game-changer for us,” Kriya Shortt, Textron Aviation’s head of sales and marketing, says.Other designs – such as Cessna’s CJ3+, which has just received certification – are using efficiency gains to reduce the cost of private aviation and bring it in reach of a wider range of buyers.The new aircraft are just far more capable, with far fewer trade-offsDustin Dryden, chief executive of Hangar8, a corporate aviation charter and management company, predicts a growing role for such aircraft, which can compete with the price of a business class ticket for a party of three or four.Yet the challenge facing the corporate aviation industry, after development of the new jets, may be to persuade customers to buy them. Demand collapsed after the 2008 financial crisis and remains flat or declining across much of the industry.Mr O’Day says many in the industry hope the new products will encourage sales. Mr Dryden points to their ample room and sophisticated entertainment and in-cabin systems. But at a list price of $72m, those who purchase them might consider buying and outfitting a commercial airliner instead.“There are folks that are expecting the stimulus of new products perhaps to stimulate some more purchasers,” he says.It bears eloquent testimony to the continued depressed demand across much of the market that the greatest optimism surrounds the Global 7000 and 8000 products, whose list prices are around $72m.“If you’d announced [the launches of the 7000 and 8000] three years ago, people would have laughed at you and said, ‘Not in a million years would someone produce that and expect to get an order’,” Mr Dryden says.
11;TXT;Textron Inc;2014-10-20T14:53:48Z;Helicopter market eyes civilian tilt-rotor models;Commercial aviation aims to tap into the military’s demand for tilt-rotor aircraft;Bell Helicopter is a name that is almost synonymous with rotary aircraft. One of the enduring images of the Korean war is the plexiglas bubble and trellis frame of the Bell 47 helicopter, used to transfer the wounded to mobile field hospitals. A few years later, the company’s Huey model was one of the stars of the Vietnam conflict, helping to redefine the role of air power in complex, asymmetric warfare. And the Bell 206 Jet Ranger became a symbol for wealth and aspiration around the world as an affordable and easy-to-fly helicopter.The company was set up in 1935 to produce fixed-wing aircraft but swiftly moved to innovate in the-then brand new world of rotary lift, flying its first helicopter in 1942. Much more recently, the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor military aircraft has had a big share of problems and cost over-runs but the programme, undertaken jointly with Boeing, has been a good platform for Bell’s technical expertise in the rotary field.Now Texas-based Bell, owned by Textron which has fixed-wing manufacturers Cessna and Beechcraft under its Textron Aviation banner, has some work to do in the commercial field, especially in Europe, to fight against the power of Airbus Helicopters (the former Eurocopter), and AgustaWestland. Bell had revenues of $4.5bn in 2013 – up on the previous year’s $4.3bn – compared with Airbus Helicopters’ €6.3bn and AgustaWestland’s €4.1bn.Current military programmes include additional Osprey deliveries over the next five years and potential US and overseas sales, H-1 utility and attack helicopter upgrades, plus the V-280 Valor tilt-rotor project – which has been chosen by the US military as one of two contenders in the search for a rapid joint multi-role rotorcraft. The Valor’s rival is a Sikorsky-Boeing collaboration.But the Valor is still some way off – first flight would not be until late 2017. For now, Bell is pushing harder for commercial sales.“Around five years ago we were about 75 per cent military, 25 per cent commercial sales,” says John Garrison, chief executive of Bell Helicopter. “This year we’ll be about 55 per cent military and 45 per cent commercial. So we’ve seen a fairly substantial growth in our commercial business that we need to offset the downturn in US Department of Defense spending with the V-22 volumes coming down.”The growth has come from upgraded products such as the single-engine 407, in which Bell has seen a tripling of sales in Europe over the past two years. And from models newer to market – two years ago there were just two Bell 429 light twin-engined helicopters in Europe and now there are more than 40. “The 429 has enabled us to enter the para-public market,” says Mr Garrison, “with a lot of success in Turkey.”The 505 Jet Ranger X, the planned successor to the single-engine Jet Ranger, has 200 letters of intent including 40 from Europe – which is traditionally seen as a twin-engined market because of restrictions on flying in poor weather in helicopters with just one engine. At the other end of the scale, the 525 Relentless “super-medium” twin, with seating for up to 20 passengers, will enable Bell to pursue sales in the offshore energy market where it has not previously had a rival to offerings from Airbus Helicopters and AgustaWestland.“Europe is the second-largest vertical lift market in the world today after the US,” says Mr Garrison. “It doesn’t have the same growth rate as places like India, China and Brazil, but when you look at installed base to installed base, it’s the second largest today and I suspect it’ll be the second largest in 20 years.“Even though the market growth rate is not significant, our market position is so low that we can grow despite the market not growing dramatically.”For too many years Bell relied on military customers while Airbus and AgustaWestland prioritised civil model developmentWorldwide, the market for civil helicopters returned to modest growth of 11.4 per cent, according to US-based aviation analyst Teal Group, driven by energy industry and public sector demand. The military market, however is trending downwards.In that context, Bell’s shift in focus is appropriate. Richard Aboulafia, vice-president for analysis at Teal, says: “The 505 and 525 are a solid start, but it will take more work to get back to the number two position. For too many years Bell relied on military customers while Airbus and AgustaWestland prioritised civil model development.”Usman Ahmed, senior aviation analyst at the International Bureau of Aviation consultancy, says Bell has “woken up in Europe. Their marketing strategy is definitely working and recent sales of the Bell 429 confirm this.” But he warns that while the Bell 525 matches the offerings of AgustaWestland and is almost on a par with Airbus Helicopters products, “Bell still do not have a helicopter in the heavy category, and it remains a two-horse race between Airbus Helicopters and Sikorsky”.Bell in 2011 bowed out of the AW609 civilian light tilt-rotor project, which was taken on wholly by Bell’s partner AgustaWestland, but Mr Garrison stresses that technical and other continuing collaborations mean that the Texan company has a substantial interest in the aircraft doing well when it finally comes to the market.But with the focus growing among military customers on vertical-lift aircraft that can travel faster and further than conventional helicopters, Mr Garrison says that Bell has a strategy to “extend the tilt-rotor franchise way into the future”.Alongside its Valor military project, Bell is looking at ways in which the same technology can be used in a commercial vertical-lift aircraft. Mr Garrison points out that the market for Valor-sized military aircraft is substantial. “We’re talking 2-4,000 aircraft,” he says, adding that a commercial model of this medium-sized helicopter could be more successful than the smaller AW609.If that vision does come to pass – there are a fair few points at which it could stumble – the name Bell could be synonymous not just with helicopters but with all fast rotorcraft.
12;TXT;Textron Inc;2014-01-22T19:08:26Z;Companies buoyed by investors’ deal hunger;;"Investors are rewarding acquisitive companies with higher share prices in a striking reversal of long-term trends, according to data compiled for the Financial Times that highlight resurgent shareholder appetite for deals.Last year, share prices of US companies announcing acquisitions with a value of $1bn or more rose, on average, more than 4 per cent within a day.The increase is the largest ever recorded by Dealogic, the analytics group, and nearly 50 per cent higher than in 2012. It also highlights the departure from the long-term trend whereby the following day the share price fell every single year between 1996 and 2011.Opinion is divided about the causes behind the phenomenon, however.“ Investors love to see organic growth, but, when they can’t get it, they are going to reward those companies that use acquisitions to grow,” said Scott Barshay, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer at Cravath.Mr Barshay worked on the deal that saw the largest jump in the acquiring company’s share price last year. When publisher Gannett agreed to a cash payment of $1.5bn for Belo, the Dallas-based television station owner, its share price soared 26 per cent within 24 hours.“There are a lot of smart deals being done that make sense from a short- and long-term view and that is reflected in the market reaction,” he added.Steven Barg, head of M&A capital markets at Goldman Sachs, argues that the rising share prices are a function of the abundance of cheap debt. “If money is cheap, then investors want a company to have high operating and financing leverage; you are buying earnings cheaply and people believe earnings will grow.Of non-financial companies in the S&P Global 1200 index, just 8.4 per cent hold 50 per cent of the cash“When the cost of debt substantially goes up from here, the share price rises we are seeing will be moderate. It is a question of economics.”The trend of rising share prices for acquiring companies also applies when deals are first rumoured, before they are officially confirmed.Shares in Textron, the maker of Cessna aircraft, rose 14.5 per cent on the day the FT reported it was buying rival jet maker Beechcraft. The increase equated to a rise in market capitalisation greater than the $1.4bn it had offered to pay. Similarly, when The Wall Street Journal wrote about news of Dutch group Aercap’s $5bn acquisition of AIG’s aircraft leasing unit in mid-December, the company’s shares soared 33 per cent and are today up close to 80 per cent.The increasing presence of activist investors is an added incentive for dealmaking. The alternative of being pushed into better capital allocation, often in public, by an activist fund is one that boards and management are keen to avoid.“The companies that are being smart about using their balance sheets, and can articulate a good story about why they are doing a deal, are being rewarded by investors,” said Sarkis Jebejian, a corporate partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis.“Being proactive with regards to using cash is something investors want to see at the moment.”"
13;TXT;Textron Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Beechcraft nears $1.4bn sale to Textron;;Beechcraft Corporation, the Kansas-based aircraft maker, is closing in on a $1.4bn sale to the owner of Cessna in a deal that will secure the future of the company which emerged from bankruptcy just nine months ago.Textron, which also builds Bell helicopters, may announce the deal to buy Beechcraft as early as Friday, according to people familiar with the matter. Textron’s shares closed up 14.5 per cent at a five-year high of $37.29, valuing it at $10.48bnBeechcraft hired Credit Suisse in October to sound out potential buyers, according to people familiar with the process. The company is shifting away from its money-losing jet aircraft business and focusing instead on the less competitive propeller-powered aircraft market.Other interested parties were rumoured to include Brazil’s Embraer and Indian group Mahindra & Mahindra.The company – formerly known as Hawker Beechcraft and owned by a consortium of Goldman Sachs and Onyx – sought bankruptcy protection in May 2012 after suffering from declining orders for its Hawker business jets.An $1.8bn deal in mid-2012 to sell it to Superior Aviation Beijing, a group about which little was known, broke down months later when the buyer failed to secure financing. SAB lobbied strenuously, but ultimately unsuccessfully, for the return of its $50m deposit.It emerged from Chapter 11 in February this year after closing down the Hawker business.The company told the Financial Times in August that it was basing its future plans on strong demand from the natural resources industry for its robust aircraft, which are capable of landing in conditions where jets would be unable to touch down.Also in August, the company announced an order from Wheels Up, an aircraft ownership club, for 104 of its King Air turboprops – a deal that Beechcraft valued at $1.4bn.For Textron, Beechcraft will further extend the range of aircraft it can offer customers. Cessna already offers a wider range of aircraft than any other maker of general aviation aircraft and the Beechcraft purchase will further strengthen its offering at the smaller, propeller-powered end of its range.Cessna believes that aircraft buyers tend to be loyal to a particular brand and will stick with it as they gradually buy larger aircraft.Centerbridge Partners, Sankaty Advisors and Angelo Gordon own about 90 per cent of Beechcraft.None of the parties involved would discuss the process.
14;TXT;Textron Inc;2013-04-17T19:11:35Z;Textron: Cessna turbulence;Jet sales have not come back as corporate earnings have boomed;"First gold collapsed. Then premium cupcakes. Now corporate jets. Coke dealers and Dubai real estate brokers: you are officially on notice.On Wednesday, Textron, maker of Cessna aircraft, reduced its 2013 outlook for business jet deliveries, foreseeing a decline from 2012, and brought down its earnings guidance by almost a tenth. The stock fell by 13 per cent. The depth of the guidance cut, and the reaction, might seem puzzling. Cessna accounted for a quarter of Textron’s revenues last year, but only about 7 per cent of its segment profits (the company also makes helicopters and drones, among other things).Part of the explanation is the high operating leverage in manufacturing aircraft: a little sales growth can mean a big jump in profit. Equally important, resurgence at Cessna has been long awaited, and is a key part of any bullish long-term view of Textron. The business jet market, as JPMorgan has shown, was historically correlated with corporate profits, but jet sales have not come back as corporate earnings have boomed since the financial crisis. Cessna sold $5.6bn in aircraft in 2008; it sold $3.1bn worth in 2012. The temptation to put 2008-like Cessna revenue figure into a Textron earnings model may have been difficult for analysts to resist. Now, however, 2008 looks farther away than ever.The corporate jet is a symbol of excess some companies may be leery of, and the recent surge in corporate profits has less to do with growth than spending less on things like aircraft. Worse, the profit cycle appears to be turning over. Is there any reason for hope at Cessna? A key question is whether it can go where the growth is. Roughly 85 of per cent of Cessna sales come from North America and Europe. If giddy corporate spending is going to blossom again soon, it is unlikely to happen there.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
15;TXT;Textron Inc;2012-10-26T17:00:31Z;Concerns over US ‘fiscal cliff’ widen;;More than 150 publicly listed companies in the US over the past month have warned investors about the possible effects of the looming “fiscal cliff” of tax increases and government spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year.Though both Republican and Democratic policy makers have said they will attempt to soften its effect, if left unresolved the fiscal tightening would be equivalent to roughly 4 per cent of the nation’s gross domestic product. The Congressional Budget Office and economists on Wall Street have said it is likely to lead to recession.High-profile companies such as Procter & Gamble, KKR Financial and CME Group have issued warnings. Others including Webster Financial, Comerica and Verizon have begun telling investors that uncertainty over the fiscal cliff may have already affected demand for goods and services.Lazard said it is affecting corporate confidence and may be impeding mergers and acquisitions. Cemex, the Mexican cement manufacturer and one of the world’s largest, said an unresolved cliff could have a “huge” effect on consumption. KKR Financial said it is among the reasons why it continues to hold on to cash.“There’s plenty of reasons to look right now and say, ‘Geez, I don’t know what’s going on’,” Scott Donnelly, Textron chief executive, said last week.Equity analysts have been asking companies to detail how it has affected quarterly earnings and for guidance on future results. Close to 170 companies have addressed the fiscal cliff in earnings calls over the past 30 days, according to a Financial Times review of transcripts compiled by FactSet, a data provider.The cliff includes the expiration of all the tax cuts passed by former president George W. Bush and a temporary 2 percentage point reduction in social security payroll taxes initiated by President Barack Obama, as well as $1.2tn in other spending cuts over the next decade.Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, said: “This government of ours could be shut down, if in fact certain things play out. And people don’t know what that means for the marketplace.”Comerica, a bank with $63bn in assets, told analysts that while it saw a “very significant increase” in credit commitments, customers are not taking advantage by borrowing.Jim Rohr, chief executive of PNC, a $301bn lender, said: “We’re really just not seeing people plunking down a lot of dough to expand their business and build plants and hire a lot of people because of the environmental factors that we have.”US Bancorp told analysts to expect slower loan growth this quarter and “until we know what happens after the election and the fiscal cliff”.This week, a group of chief executives pressed for legislation to reduce US government debt. The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade lobby, reckoned that worries over the fiscal cliff this year have already shaved 0.6 percentage points off economic growth.
16;TXT;Textron Inc;2012-10-18T15:49:48Z;Hawker corporate jet business in doubt;;The future of the corporate jet business of Hawker Beechcraft, one of the world’s biggest makers of private aircraft, looks uncertain after the bankrupt company announced talks with a Chinese potential buyer had broken down.Hawker Beechcraft had previously said that if the talks with Superior Aviation Beijing were unsuccessful, it would be forced to cease production of its Hawker product lines, which compete in the crowded market for corporate jets.In the statement announcing the breakdown of the talks, Hawker Beechcraft said it intended to emerge from bankruptcy as a standalone company focused on its turboprop, piston engined and other non-jet aircraft. It would rename itself Beechcraft Corp and said it was “evaluating its strategic alternatives” for the Hawker business and that these included sale of some or all of the product lines and closure.Hawker Beechcraft had undertaken to separate out its military aircraft business, which makes trainers and attack aircraft, from its other business lines if Superior, which is 40 per cent owned by Beijing’s city government, took over.The deal had been one of several in recent months to raise concerns about the potential for Chinese companies that purchase American assets to compromise US national security. A person familiar with the transaction’s details said the deal had broken down over other issues before a discussion started on achieving US regulators’ approval.Robert Miller, Hawker Beechcraft’s chief executive, said the company had decided to emerge from bankruptcy as an independent company after determining that the transaction could not be completed on terms acceptable to the company.“The go-forward business plan we have developed with our creditors ensures that we will emerge from this process in a strong operational and financial position, with an enhanced ability to compete well into the future,” Mr Miller said.One of the challenges facing any deal had been to separate the military business so thoroughly that regulators would be confident no US military knowhow would leak to the civil side of the operation. Superior had also hoped to tap into rapid growth in demand for private aircraft in China, growth that is now likely to slow with China’s economic growth. Details of the problems that led to the breakdown of the talks are likely to be included in a bankruptcy court filing in the next week.Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Onex Partners, the private equity groups, purchased Hawker Beechcraft in 2007 for $3.3bn at the height of demand for private aircraft and loaded the company with debt. The company sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May amid a slump in demand for corporate aircraft and fierce competition in the business jet market from rivals such as Canada’s Bombardier, Brazil’s Embraer and Cessna, part of Textron.Fewer manufacturers in the sector focus on the shorter-range, lower-speed turboprop and piston engine aircraft that are Beechcraft’s speciality.

Mr Icahn holds around 13.5 per cent of Navistar’s shares. Mr Icahn demanded that Navistar appoint four representatives of the company’s main shareholders to its board to oversee such strategic decisions.Navistar said that it maintained an “ongoing dialogue” with its shareholders. It went on: “As such, after a year of dialogue, we are extremely disappointed that Mr. Icahn has chosen to pursue his unproductive tactics of threats, attacks, and disruption rather than continuing constructive engagement, particularly at this important time for Navistar.”The board and management had a clear path forward, the company added, and were focusing on executing it.Mr Icahn had written in his letter about his grave concern for Navistar, which he said had become “a poster child for abysmal business decisions and poor corporate governance”. He accused the board of having stood idly by as Navistar’s share of sales of Class 8 trucks – the heaviest category – had fallen over the last two-and-a-half years from 25 per cent to 15 per cent.“I am led to the inevitable conclusion that Navistar is a company with a board asleep at the switch,” Mr Icahn wrote.At the heart of many of Navistar’s problems has been its struggle to develop a new engine meeting the latest US environmental protection agency guidelines for emissions levels. On September 6, Navistar reported net income of $84m for the quarter to July 31 – but would have reported a significant loss but for an exceptional income tax benefit of $196m.Mr Campbell said then that the company was “not pleased” with the results but was satisfied to learn on day one in the job that Troy Clarke, chief operating officer, and his team had plans to deal with the issues the company faced.Navistar has said it plans to solve its engine problems by offering various engines from Cummins, the diesel engine maker, in certain models, starting from December.Navistar’s shares fell 3 per cent to $23.99.
18;TXT;Textron Inc;2012-06-18T20:50:51Z;Private jets;Orders seem to indicate the industry is on the up;For four years the business jet industry has had precious few reasons for cheer. But last week NetJets, the fractional jet company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, placed orders for up to 425 new aircraft worth almost $10bn. After sales slumped about 60 per cent between 2008 and 2011, is the sector finally on the up?Certainly the order highlights improvements at NetJets. During the recession the company had it rough. In 2009 it generated a pre-tax loss of $710m and would have collapsed without support from Berkshire. But in 2011 NetJets made pre-tax profits of $230m thanks to new management and cost cutting.The outlook for the market, however, looks mixed. On the one hand, companies purchase about 65 per cent of all business aircraft so corporate profits are a main indicator of demand. And despite economic uncertainty, earnings continue to be strong. That bodes well for the sector. On the other hand, amid the eurozone crisis, business jet traffic has flattened out after a modest recovery in 2010 and remains about 15 per cent below pre-recession levels in Europe and the US. Stocks of used aircraft for sale also remain high, pressuring jet prices.Adding to the confusion, sales and prices of large jets, such as those built by Bombardier and Gulfstream, part of General Dynamics, have held up, but makers focused on small jets have struggled. In May, Hawker Beechcraft filed for Chapter 11. New entrants such as Honda and Eclipse Aerospace will only compound the problem of overcapacity.Even the NetJets order may be less than meets the eye. Bombardier and Cessna, part of Textron, won new contracts, but a handful of long-time suppliers lost out. And in the past fractionals have proved fair-weather friends, cutting orders as conditions worsen. Stay seated Warren Buffett.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
19;TXT;Textron Inc;2012-05-13T22:47:34Z;Hawker Beechcraft: Pummelled by crisis;The aircraft manufacturer has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while it restructures, reports Jeremy Lemer;"When Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Onex purchased Hawker Beechcraft in 2007 for $3.3bn, the US-based company was riding high. That year, Hawker delivered more than 400 aircraft and it seemed the market could only go up.In 2011, however, the maker of business and military training planes delivered about 291 aircraft and it now stands on a precipice. Weighed down with more than $2bn in debt, at the start of May Hawker filed for bankruptcy protection while it restructures.According to court filings, the company is now considering exiting entire business lines, closing manufacturing sites in the US and the UK, and further cutting its headcount, as it tries to find a route to profitability.The need for action is evident. Last year, operating losses widened to $481.8m from $173.9m in 2010 and revenues fell about 13 per cent to $2.4bn. Meanwhile, the backlog of orders dwindled to $1.1bn, down from $7.6bn in 2008.To be fair, Hawker and its private equity owners have been under pressure from the word go. Industry executives note that 2007 was near the peak of the market and that the business jet industry has been losing ground ever since.Pummelled by the global financial crisis, sales of general aviation aircraft have tumbled from 4,272 units in 2007 to about 1,865 units in 2011, according to the leading US trade association.Analysts note that the market for Hawker’s small to midsize jets has been particularly hard hit and remains depressed.While experts expect a modest recovery this year, aircraft worth less than $25m are likely to remain difficult to sell.“That segment is the first one to go away in a downturn and the last one to come back,” says one sector banker. “And Hawker is in a very crowded space, with lots of companies impinging on its turf.”During a period of the precipitous market decline, Hawker has struggled, pinned down by its huge debt burden. The company has renegotiated terms, cut thousands of jobs and shifted production towards lower-cost locations, to limited effect.Through the Chapter 11 process Hawker will tackle its debt issue head on. The company is set to eliminate about $2.5bn of debt and, in return, it will hand equity ownership to a group of bondholders as part of a pre-arranged deal with creditors.“Restructuring our balance sheet and recapitalising …will dramatically improve Hawker Beechcraft’s ability to compete in a rapidly changing environment,” Robert Miller, chief executive of Hawker, said in a statement.Improving its results could require equally radical moves. Hawker said in court documents that it was looking at options ranging from continuing largely as it is to dropping its line of business jets and focusing on turboprop, piston and military aircraft and services.Under that scenario, Hawker would consolidate plants in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Chester, UK; stop producing Hawker 900s, Hawker 4000s and Beechcraft Premiers; and further reduce headcount.By 2016 revenues would still be lower than in 2011, but the company predicts an earnings rebound. The moves should also “better position the company for later industry consolidation” and “eliminate the culture clash” between its brands.Still, Richard Aboulafia, vice-president at the Teal Group, an industry analyst, worries the options are too “draconian” and “imply there’s a lot less value in the product line than believed”, as well relying on overly optimistic assessments of military demand.“Their best hope is to keep as much as possible of their civil jet business intact, rather than shrinking to a much smaller core that may lose ground in military markets too,” Mr Aboulafia says.Hawker expects to file a reorganisation plan by the end of June and execute it by mid-December.In the meantime, the company remains vulnerable to external forces. Suppliers have already begun to demand tougher terms for dealing with the company and, as long as Hawker remains in bankruptcy protection and is publicly discussing the idea of culling its portfolio, there is a risk the uncertainty will dent customer confidence.Scott Donnelly, chief executive of Textron, which owns rival Cessna, said last month: “It’s pretty hard to have a serious discussion with a customer about buying a $20m asset if there’s uncertainty about who is going to be there to support that aircraft.”"
20;TXT;Textron Inc;2012-05-03T22:31:47Z;Hawker seeks bankruptcy protection;;Hawker Beechcraft has filed for bankruptcy protection after lining up a deal that will wipe out the equity stakes of Goldman Sachs and Onex, its current owners, and hand the ailing aircraft manufacturer to a group of creditors.Hawker said it had reached the voluntary agreement with the majority of its creditors to eliminate $2.5bn debt and $125m of annual interest payments and raised $400m to fund its operations during the Chapter 11 restructuring process.If the plans are approved by the courts, the moves will leave the company’s equity with bondholders, including groups such as Angelo, Gordon & Co, Centerbridge Partners and Capital Research & Management.Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Onex Partners, the private equity groups, purchased Hawker in 2007 for $3.3bn at the peak of the cycle and loaded the company with debt that it has struggled to repay.But Hawker’s problems run deeper than its capital structure. Last year operating losses widened to $481.8m from $173.9m in 2010 and revenues fell about 13 per cent to $2.4bn.Behind those numbers lies a market for small to midsize business jets that has tumbled since 2008 and has yet to rebound amid a tepid global economic recovery.Robert Miller, chief executive of Hawker, said: “Restructuring our balance sheet and recapitalising the company in partnership with our debtholders will dramatically improve Hawker Beechcraft’s ability to compete in a rapidly changing environment.”Analysts and competitors think that Chapter 11 could well exacerbate Hawker’s travails if uncertainty about its future damages the brand, which depends in part on the company’s ability to provide long-term warranties and servicing to clients.In April, Scott Donnelly, chief executive of Textron, owner of rival Cessna, predicted his company and peers such as Bombardier, the Canadian company, and Embraer, the Brazilian aerospace group, were set to pick up market share.“It’s pretty hard to have a serious discussion with a customer about buying a … $20m asset if there’s uncertainty about who is going to be there to support that aircraft,” Mr Donnelly said of Hawker.Hawker took pains to address those concerns on Thursday, noting that its operations would continue and adding that “deposits and progress payments will be secure and all customer orders for available products will be fulfilled.”The company expects to complete its financial revamp by the end of the year, but turning the underlying business around will be a challenge. Hawker filed its 2011 results late because of IT problems, has struggled to retain staff and has been hit by supply chain disruptions.The company has cut thousands of jobs, reduced its inventories and shifted some production out of Wichita, Kansas, towards lower cost locations such as Mexico, but the impact has been limited.Should it miss a step, its rivals are ready to pounce. “There are certainly some assets there that we think would be very interesting,” Mr Donnelly said of Hawker’s product lines last month.
21;TXT;Textron Inc;2012-02-07T19:12:12Z;Setbacks that lead to success;Too many suffer from an irrational fear of failure;"Probably the most popular speech I’ve given recently is what I call a series of “hard lessons” – expensive mistakes I’ve made over the past few decades in business, and what I’ve attempted to learn from them. I suspect the talk works because everyone enjoys hearing about someone else’s disasters.Like most things, the idea wasn’t original. It was inspired by Royal Little’s autobiography, called How to Lose $100,000,000 and Other Valuable Advice. Little was the founder of Textron, the US conglomerate that still thrives today, and a pioneer venture capitalist. He spent a long career making hundreds of acquisitions, investments and management decisions. In the book he details every failure – even though, overall, he was a considerable success. He knows that we always learn more from our blunders.One of the remarkable aspects of Little’s book is that it’s very un-American – few high achievers there dwell on their flops. Instead they tend to be positive thinkers who focus on the future. In Britain, by contrast, we love self-deprecation and hate conceit and boastfulness – characteristics that might be seen as self-confidence across the Atlantic.Obsessing about past errors is not wise but to imagine that running and backing companies should be an unbroken series of victories is to court disappointment. It pays to understand and remember one’s own defeats, the difficulties endured by famous tycoons, and that we should all expect our fair share of cock-ups in the future. They are an inescapable part of commercial life; pretending otherwise is denial. As Winston Churchill said, “you will make all kinds of mistakes, but as long as you are generous and true, and also fierce, you cannot hurt the world or even seriously distress her”.Far too many who think about launching a start-up shy away from taking the plunge because they suffer from an irrational fear of failure. Of course things may well go wrong but the worst very rarely happens. And the pain and stigma of failure is never as bad as one imagines. Generally speaking life moves on, new opportunities arise, the world forgives and time tends to heal even the deepest wounds. Sure, there are scars, but they form part of what one might call one’s education. As they say, what can seem like a crisis at the time fades to a footnote before too long.Embracing failure does not mean seeking it out, in the way that some gambling addicts actually enjoy losing. Rather it means accepting that the entrepreneurial life is full of stumbles and setbacks. They are part of the journey, and should be confronted and overcome. Rolling with the punches is partly what enables you to come out the other side fighting. Mankind would not progress without bold enterprise.Almost without exception, all the entrepreneurs I’ve worked with have had episodes when their luck ran out and they confronted catastrophe. In some cases a company goes bust, or a fire destroys a building or a major new product launch dies. These are invariably formative experiences that make the protagonist stronger.Perhaps entrepreneurs are subconsciously following the quest set out by Joseph Campbell in his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. This work describes how almost all myths have the following basic narrative: “A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder; fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won; the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow men.” In such tales the hero must invariably overcome difficulties and confront his own demons.Those who build businesses are usually portrayed as ruthless moneymakers but very often they are romantics at heart, engaged in what they see as a mission, looking to slay dragons. Great innovators who discover new products are the ones who seek the biggest challenges – and must steel themselves for the toughest blows. Genuine inventions are what drive progress and job creation – but making them happen is arduous and risky, while never giving way to despair is the secret ingredient behind every triumph.lukej@riskcapitalpartners.co.ukThe writer runs Risk Capital Partners, a private equity firm, and is chairman of the Royal Society of Arts"

But it pared losses later when the Federal Open Market Committee said interest rates would stay low until late 2014, longer than previously stated.That triggered a 15 point afternoon rally for the benchmark index, but analysts were cautious about both the FOMC meeting and prospects for the bull market.“It’s clear the make-up of the Fed board has become more dovish and it will do what it can to inoculate the US economy from global problems,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist with Prudential Financial. “On the other hand, the Fed is acknowledging that US growth will be substandard, which can’t be good for equities.”Apple had earlier briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as shares surged following Tuesday’s blockbuster results.Shares closed up 6.2 per cent at $446.66, having hit an all-time high of $454.45 at the open.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index to gain 1.1 per cent to 2,818.31, and triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.Qualcomm, which manufactures microchips used in the iPhone 4S, climbed 0.6 per cent to $59.00, as analysts at JPMorgan said: “Apple’s very strong numbers give us more confidence that Qualcomm should report strong numbers and guide well in its earnings report next Wednesday.”Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, climbed 3.1 per cent to $6.73, despite opening sharply lower after cutting full-year guidance. But Nvidia, which hopes to supply the next generation of Macs, fell 0.6 per cent to $14.85 after reducing fourth-quarter sales projections.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,758.85, lagging other indicesGoldman Sachs fell 0.5 per cent to $108.31, and Morgan Stanley was off 0.1 per cent to $18.12, as JPMorgan analysts said a new method for calculating risk requirements, without reference to rating agencies, could reduce Goldman’s 2012 tier one capital ratio by 1.2 percentage points and Morgan Stanley’s by 0.8 percentage points.“Yet another US investment bank disadvantage,” JPMorgan said and removed “buy” recommendations on both banks.Illumina climbed 46.3 per cent to $55.15 as Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, launched a hostile bid for the diagnostics company. Roche has offered $44.50 a share in cash, but investors appear to believe Illumina will hold out for a higher price.Airlines advanced after Delta Air Lines and US Airways Group both beat projections by analysts. Delta was up 6.2 per cent to $9.96, and US Airways added 17.3 per cent to $7.52.Yahoo slipped 0.8 per cent to $15.56 despite reporting results in line with expectations.

But the stock closed up 0.6 per cent to $75.82.Quarterly earnings reports propelled several large moves in the S&P 500. Textron surged 14.5 per cent to $24.76 for the best performance in the index after forecasting higher 2012 profit than analysts expected, amid growing demand for its Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters.CA Inc climbed 9.6 per cent to $25.02 as the software developer easily beat analyst expectations.Xerox fell 9.9 per cent to $7.81 as it said fourth-quarter and full-year earnings could be well below analyst expectations, with slow global growth expected to hit demand for printers.Corning shed 10.7 per cent to $13.05 as the world’s largest maker of glass for flat-panel televisions saw quarterly earnings halve as LCD display prices sank.With almost a third of the S&P 500’s market capitalisation reported, companies have so far produced the lowest earnings beat-rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, with revenue gains outpacing profit increases, as margins are squeezed.“The V-shaped recovery in corporate profits seems to be at an end,” warned Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.In after-hours trading, shares in Netflix surged 10 per cent to as much as $108.00, after the DVD delivery and web streaming company reported earnings that beat expectations.

Jeff Black at Citigroup cut his target price for the stock from $34 to $20, removing Urban from his “top picks” list and recommending clients sell shares, while cutting his 2012 earnings forecast to $1.50 a share.Erika Maschmeyer at RW Baird downgraded the stock to a “hold” equivalent from a “buy” equivalent, while Paul Lejuez at Nomura, worried for the retailer’s turnround prospects, told clients: “If Glen can’t do it, we wonder who can?”Elsewhere, US stocks were generally flat. The S&P 500 recovered from early weakness to close up a fraction at 1,292.48.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,49.45, as Coca-Cola fell 1.9 per cent to $68.06. Kaumil Gajrawala at UBS removed his “buy” recommendation, pointing out Coca-Cola shares have had a negative correlation of 0.93 with dollar strength for the past three years.“Currency, which had been in [Coca-Cola’s] favour, unnaturally increased operating margins [in 2011 but] goes against them in 2012,” Mr Gajrawala wrote to clients.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index bucked the trend of larger indices, advancing 0.3 per cent to 2,710.76, on a surge in solar energy stocks.First Solar was up 7.8 per cent to $41.80 and Yingli Green Energy rose 20.4 per cent to $4.96, after China said it planned to double solar electricity generation capacity to 6 gigawatts in 2012.Gas-heavy energy exploration and production companies sold off as the price of natural gas fell 5 per cent to a 28-month low of $2.78 per million British thermal units.Cabot Oil & Gas led fallers, off 11.2 per cent to $69.62, SouthWestern Energy fell 8 per cent to $29.92 as RW Baird analysts downgraded the stock to “neutral”, and Range Resources fell 6.3 per cent to $54.36.Nymex natural gas futures have fallen by a third in the past year, as higher production from US shale formations has lifted supply, and mild temperatures hurt demand.Supermarket operator Supervalu tumbled 12.5 per cent to $7.34 as the supermarket retailer recorded a loss of $750m for its third fiscal quarter. Analysts had been expecting a profit of a similar magnitude, according to Bloomberg data.The company’s margins held steady, and Supervalu said that once one-off costs associated with store closures and employee severance payments were factored out, the business had been profitable.Lennar rose 7.2 per cent to $22.25, as the first US homebuilder to report fourth-quarter results declared earnings of $30.3m, only $1.7m down on the same period in 2010.Factoring in house price moves, the company’s margin on home sales improved to 19.4 per cent, suggesting some health in the property market.But Lennar also reported mark-to-market losses of $7.6m related to distressed property purchases by its Rialto arm. That was a big swing from mark-to-market gains of $4.7m on Rialto investments in the fourth quarter of 2010. That means, if the company were to sell its distressed assets now, it would incur a substantial loss.But other homebuilders rallied on the result with PulteGroup up 4.9 per cent to $7.70 and DR Horton up 4.8 per cent to $14.13, while home improvement retailer Masco Corp climbed 4.6 per cent to $11.99.Aircraft maker and defence contractor Textron advanced 5.7 per cent to $21.32 on reports that the company was considering a strategic review that could see it dispose of assets.Large bank stocks continued to rally ahead of financials’ quarterly results season, which JPMorgan kicks off tomorrow. Bank of America climbed 3.6 per cent to $6.87 and Citigroup was up 4.3 per cent at $31.27, both at two-month highs.Money manager Franklin Resources fell 5 per cent to $96.67 after the company surprised analysts by reporting that equity assets under management fell $4bn during December to $270.2bn.Hostess Brands, the baker of Twinkies and Wonder bread, filed for bankruptcy for the second time in six years, blaming pension and healthcare obligations.
24;TXT;Textron Inc;2011-12-13T18:07:44Z;Skills gap hobbles US employers;;Drew Greenblatt has been looking for more than a year for three sheet-metal set-up operators to work day, night or weekend shifts.The president of Marlin Steel Wire Products, a company in Baltimore with 30 employees, Mr Greenblatt says his inability to find qualified workers is hampering his business’s growth. “If I could fill those positions, I could raise our annual revenues from $5m to $7m,” he says.He is offering a salary of more than $80,000 with overtime, including health and pension benefits. Yet in spite of extensive advertising, he has had no qualified applicants. He is trying to train some of his unskilled staff but says none has the ability or drive to complete the training.Mr Greenblatt’s predicament speaks to one of the biggest economic debates about today’s 8.6 per cent US unemployment rate: is it merely a cyclical problem that will shrink as demand recovers? Or is it something deeper and more structural, a “mismatch” between the skills workers have and those companies need?The idea there is something structurally wrong with the US workforce is controversial among economists but has a certain resonance with the public. Since the emergence of Japan as a technology and manufacturing powerhouse in the 1970s, Americans have been anxiousthat they were losing their competitive edge to better-educated, harder-working rivals.Economists trying to figure out whether unemployment is cyclical or structural have turned to what they call the Beveridge curve: the relationship between unemployment and the job vacancy rate.Vacancies, the number of unfilled positions, have risen by 35 per cent since their trough in June 2009 – but the unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high. If there are jobs but people are not filling them, it may be because their skills are not up to scratch, say those who fear structural unemployment.But a preponderance of economists argue this is a misreading of the data. A recent San Francisco Fed paper finds that vacancies are high relative to hiring across a broad range of industries, including those such as construction, where recent job cuts mean that there is most unlikely to be a skills shortage.The authors suggest companies may not be trying very hard to fill jobs, while workers in receipt of unemployment insurance may not be trying that hard to find them.Policy moves by the US Federal Reserve reflect a view that most unemployment is not the result of a skills mismatch. But even those who believe that today’s unemployment problem is primarily cyclical say closing the “skills gap” noted by Mr Greenblatt will be essential if Americans are to enjoy stable work and rising wages.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, told an audience in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in August that the US had to “foster the development of a skilled workforce” if it was to enjoy good longer-term prospects. The US education system “despite considerable strengths, poorly serves a substantial portion of our population,” he said.US companies that are growing say an unqualified workforce is already a significant barrier to hiring.In a September poll of owners of fast-growing, privately held US companies undertaken by the non-profit Kauffman Foundation, the inability to find qualified workers was cited as the biggest obstacle to growth. Some 40 per cent of respondents said they were being held back by the skills gap, compared with just 13 per cent by lack of demand.Advanced Technology Services (ATS), a manufacturing equipment maintenance company based in Peoria, Illinois, whose clients include Caterpillar, BorgWarner, Honeywell, Eaton and Textron, is finding it tough to fill the 160 job openings it has available for roles such as maintenance and machine technicians.The company’s revenues grew by 35 per cent last year and are on course for 25 per cent growth this year. But Jeff Owens, chief executive, says it could expand faster if it could find qualified workers more quickly. “In other businesses the capacity constraint is buildings, plant or equipment,” he says. “In our business, a service business, it’s people.”US manufacturers have 600,000 unfilled positions because of a lack of qualified skilled workers, according to a report released in October by Deloitte, the consultants, and the National Association of Manufacturers, an industry body.Jill Bellak, chief operating officer of MBX, a company in suburban Chicago that makes computer hardware, says the fast-growing business is finding it tough to find good software engineers, production workers and salespeople to add to its 78-strong workforce.“You hear how high unemployment is and you think it would be easy to hire, but companies have tended to cut their lower performers and retain their best people,” says Ms Bellak. “Meanwhile, talented people are less inclined to leave their current positions than they would be in good times.”In manufacturing, the skills problem dates at least to the 1970s and 1980s, when companies began automating factories and outsourcing production. As a result, manufacturers found they did not have jobs for the people leaving their in-house training programmes, some of which were then scrapped.Some big manufacturers still train in-house, including Boeing, the aerospace manufacturer, which spends $80m a year on training its existing workforce. But not all do. “Technology moves fast and most companies don’t have the money or resources to pay for extensive retraining,” said Sir James Dyson, the British household appliances engineer.Without in-house training programmes, companies have often been left looking for staff with specific skills. “A generation ago, employers would hire and train employees. Now, they demand trained workers,” says Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school.“The skills gap is largely a figment of companies’ imagination,” says Mr Cappelli. “They cannot find workers to do the very specific tasks they want done. That is different from not being able to find capable workers.”Companies counter that today’s jobs require a broad set of skills, and that the US educational system is not producing workers with the flexibility they need.“We have a training programme, but if someone applies for a job and doesn’t have basic math, I don’t have the wherewithal to teach them basic math,” says Charles Cannon, chief executive of JBT, a maker of food-processing machinery and airport equipment.American 15-year-olds ranked 25th among the 34 developed countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in maths, 17th in science and 14th in reading ability, according to a 2009 OECD study.Many companies are realising they need to take the initiative in collaborating with educational institutions. Martin Swarbrick, chief executive of Bison Gear & Engineering, a Chicago manufacturer with 250 staff that makes industrial motors, says his company has had such a programme in place for years and it has helped him offset the skills gap.“We’ve done a lot of promoting from within,” he says. “A lot of our people started on the shop floor and now they’re completing their Masters degrees.”
25;TXT;Textron Inc;2011-10-09T23:59:40Z;Embraer faces headwinds;Brazilian aircraft maker battles to stay on course in recession;Embraer, the Brazilian aircraft maker, is striving to stay on course in its effort to break into the front rank of the world’s manufacturers of business jets despite the turmoil in the global economy.It is just over halfway in its ambitious 10-year programme to challenge the established industry leaders with the development of a range of executive aircraft aimed at addressing most market segments from light jets to ultra-large business aircraft.It already has a successful aerospace track record as the upstart taking on the incumbent player and winning. In the past decade and a half Embraer has become the world’s leading maker of regional jets – commercial aircraft of up to 120 seats – overtaking its Canadian rival Bombardier.In the business jet arena it is facing far more rivals, however – not just Bombardier but also other well-established groups, Cessna (part of Textron), Gulfstream (part of General Dynamics) and Hawker Beechcraft of the US, and Dassault of France.At the same time Embraer’s assault on the corporate jet market is being conducted in the most adverse economic circumstances, which have inevitably taken a heavy toll on demand for new aircraft.Worldwide industry deliveries of business jets have tumbled from a peak of 1,313 in 2008 to 763 last year and there was a further 27 per cent fall to only 261 in the first half of 2011 from 355 in the same period a year ago.Despite such daunting challenges Ernest Edwards, president of Embraer Executive Jets since May this year, says the group is still on track. “We have not halted or slowed any development programmes. We have maintained our tack, which is fairly astonishing in the economic circumstances. We are meeting our objectives. We are six years through this plan to become a major player in executive jets by 2015.”Last year it claimed 19 per cent of world business jet deliveries (the numbers are flattered by its dominance of light jets), up from 14 per cent in 2009, and a 6.9 per cent share of the global industry by revenues.Embraer launched its full-scale attack on the business jet market in 2005, when the fortunes of the industry were riding high. It has been forced for more than three years to swim against the toughest economic tide, however, while continuing to invest heavily in research and development.The industry has been hit by plunging sales, falling prices and swollen inventories of used jets. Some smaller makers as well as business jet operators have collapsed, and much-vaunted new business models in particular for air taxi activities have proved largely unworkable.For its earliest corporate jet forays Embraer was able to take advantage of its regional jets by developing derivative products based on the commercial jet airframes, starting with its Legacy 600. This super midsize executive aircraft, with a capacity for 10 to 14 passengers and a range of 3,400 nautical miles (6,297kms) was derived from its 50-seat ERJ145 airliner. Announced in 2000, the first delivery was in 2002.This was followed by an incursion into the top end of the market with the launch of the Lineage 1000 jet in the ultra-large executive jet segment, based on the 100-seat Embraer 190 regional airliner. First delivery was in 2009.The big gamble and commitment to business jets was revealed in 2005, however, with the announcement by Embraer of its aim to become a major player in the sector within a decade. It revealed it was developing an all-new family of aircraft at the bottom end of the market to take advantage of the nascent segment for light and very light jets.Deliveries of the entry-level Phenom 100, capable of carrying six passengers, began at the end of 2008 with 97 delivered in 2009 and 100 in 2010. The related but larger Phenom 300 light jet was delivered to its first customer in 2009 with a further 26 delivered last year.By now Embraer had hoped combined output of the Phenom family would have reached as many as 150 a year, but Mr Edwards said the current forecast was for 100 deliveries in 2011, a 21 per cent drop from last year, as the continuing global economic uncertainty takes its toll.He insists the next building blocks in the strategy remain in place, however, as Embraer presses on with the development of a new family of aircraft, the mid-light and midsize Legacy 450 and 500 corporate jets, announced in 2008.The fuselage of the initial prototype Legacy 500 has been assembled and is being mated to the wing this month. The Brazilian group is hoping the first flight will take place before the end of the year. Two prototypes will be flown to complete the certification programme and first delivery into customer hands should take place in 2014. The 450 will follow 12 months later.Mr Edwards admits that by 2015 the “most obvious” gap in the Embraer range will be an ultra-long-range executive jet but says: “We have not identified a date for when we might fill the gap or whether we will fill it.”By the time the mid-light Legacy 450 (7-9 passengers and a range of 4,260kms) enters service in 2015, Embraer will have committed around $1bn to its business jet gamble.Despite its relative shrinking to the rest of the world, the US remains by far the biggest market for business jets with a share last year of about 43 per cent, and it is here that Embraer has made its biggest investment in sales and marketing and customer support.Since 2008 it has opened three factory-owned full maintenance and support centres on greenfield sites in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Mesa, Arizona and Hartford, Connecticut. It has also, in Melbourne, Florida, built an assembly plant for the Phenom 100 and a mock-up centre where customers can specify the interiors of aircraft. It will deliver its first US-assembled jet by the end of the year.However, Embraer can only watch and wait to see what the state of the global economy will be by the time it has completed its development programme. “There is still turmoil and this is causing consternation,” says Mr Edwards. “There are pockets of resistance to the malaise, in Europe, the Middle East, in Asia and in Latin America . . . We have a broad range of products and we have a world in which to sell them.”
26;TXT;Textron Inc;2011-09-19T21:04:56Z;Defence stocks diverge on M&A talk;;Goodrich Corp jumped 15.8 per cent to $107.60 on reports that industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation is preparing a bid for the aircraft manufacturer.Indications last week that Connecticut-based UTC was raising an acquisitions war chest had sent several shares in potential targets in the defence industry soaring.On Monday shares in Rockwell Collins, down 4.2 per cent to $53.87, and Textron, off 5.7 per cent at $17.57, dropped back, as UTC appeared to focus on Goodrich.Some analysts warned that those stocks could continue to see large swings, until UTC confirms an acquisition of Goodrich, but there seemed little prospect of HTC bidding for more than one company at once.“Buying Goodrich would take UTC’s net debt from 20 per cent to almost 50 per cent of market capitalisation. If it happens I don’t see them buying anyone else for a while,” Cai von Rumohr at Cowen and Company.UTC shares were up 0.1 per cent at $75.55.While defence stocks diverged, the rest of Wall Street suffered an almost uniformly dreary day. Every sector of the S&P 500 fell, as the benchmark index ended a five-day rally, and dipped back beneath 1,200 for large parts of the day.The index eventually ended the day down only 1 per cent to 1,204.09. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 11,401.01 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.4 per cent to 2,612.83.“Bears have taken charge again for the moment,” said Colin Cieszynski, market strategist at CMC Markets, as investor concern about a possible Greek default mounted once again. Cieszynski said traders was now looking to a specially extended two-day Federal Reserve meeting to reverse sentiment.“The street may look to more creative responses when the decision and comments come out on Wednesday afternoon,” he said.Big banks again saw heavy selling, with Morgan Stanley, down 7.9 per cent to $15.15 and bellwether regional bank Regions Financial off 4.8 per cent to $3.81.Online job search company Monster Worldwide fell 7 per cent per cent to $8.35, as recession fears hurt recruiters.Life insurers fell after rallying strongly last week. MetLife Inc fell 4.6 per cent to $31.51 and Genworth Financial fell 4.4 per cent to $5.89, in the process giving up almost all of its gains from last week.Investors continue to fear that record low Treasury interest rates and soft equity markets will hamper life insurers’ attempts to generate returns on premiums.In another sign of faltering sentiment, Barclays Capital, an investment bank that has maintained a bullish stance on the S&P 500 throughout recent volatility, advised clients to take a more defensive approach towards the index.“Following the early August 2011 sell-off, we positioned our sector recommendations to take advantage of what worked in the August 2010 rally. [Then] early to mid-cycle cyclicals outperformed …defensives underperformed,” US equities strategist Barry Knapp wrote to clients.But Mr Knapp conceded that “the leadership in the latest rally has had a decidedly defensive tone with utilities and healthcare leading the charge”.He told clients to remain “tactically tilted to cyclicals to take advantage of our expectation for a continued rally off the lows”, but to buy defensive dividend-yielding telecom stocks, which may be less correlated to the market in a further sell-off.Netflix fell 7.4 per cent to $143.75, after announcing it will hive off its DVD mail delivery service into a separate business called Qwikster.The stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since announcing on Thursday that it expected 1m customers to cancel subscriptions because of a price rise for combined DVD and streaming services.Among the bright spots, shares in Tyco International advanced 2.4 per cent to $44.75, after the industrial conglomerate said that it would split into three separate companies to maximise value.Shares in homebuilder Lennar advanced 4.9 per cent to $14.47 after the company reported quarterly results, which showed a quarter-on-quarter increase in new orders and a growing backlog of contracts to be complete.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, saying the medical wholesalers were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, arguing saying the medical wholesalers are were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.

The benchmark index was up 5.2 per cent for the week at 1,216.01.The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.7 per cent to 11,509.09 and the Nasdaq Composite index 6.1 per cent to 2,622.31.But amid the strong performance, a pair of previously high-flying tech shares were hit hard by falling expectations.Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, plunged after the company reported disappointing sales of its new tablet products, just 200,000 versus forecasts of more than half a million. RIM had been hoping that its PlayBook units could compete with Apple’s iPad. It also shipped 1m fewer Blackberries than forecast.RIM was down 19 per cent on Friday, and 19.7 per cent for the week, at $23.93. That is just above the shares’ trough of $21 in August, which was a five-year low.“With Android [phones] combined with increasing distribution of the legacy iPhone 3GS from Apple at aggressive price points globally, RIM continues to lose global smartphone market share,” said Michael Walkley, analyst at Canaccord Genuity.Meanwhile, Netflix, the DVD and movie-streaming subscription service, led decliners in the S&P 500 for the week, falling 24 per cent to $155.19. The company was one of the best performers in 2010, when its share price more than tripled. But it has been hit by subscriber losses after raising the price for customers who want to receive physical DVDs by post, as well as stream content online. It reported this week that it had lost 1m customers after the price change. On Friday, analysts at Jefferies lowered their price target to $190.Cyclical sectors were the top performers in the S&P 500. Consumer groups catering to discretionary spenders were up 6.9 per cent, and tech stocks rose 7.1 per cent. However, both sectors are still trading beneath their levels at the start of August, convincing some strategists that the rally is not based on a major shift in expectations.“There are only two sectors trading above their 50-day moving averages – consumer staples and utilities – and both of them are defensive in nature,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group. “Until we begin to see some cyclical sectors start breaking their recent downtrends, it will be hard for the bulls to get comfortable,” they added.The top performer in the index for the week was Textron, the aircraft manufacturer. The shares added 22.1 per cent to $18.63, as the company announced a swap of convertible debt for straight debt. Analysts said it was, in effect, a share buy-back, likely reducing outstanding shares by 12 per cent, according to Credit Suisse.The shares were also on the rise amid rumours that United Technologies, the defence and industrial conglomerate, was on the hunt for acquisitions. Its shares added 7 per cent on the week to $75.50, while Rockwell Collins, another potential bid target, jumped 17.3 per cent to $56.21McGraw-Hill added 16.7 per cent to $45.29 after announcing it would split into two companies following pressure from investors. The split will result in an education group and a financial group that includes Standard and Poor’s, the ratings agency.Juniper Networks fell 6.2 per cent on the week to $20.15 after its larger rival in computer networking equipment, Cisco, announced it was launching products directly aimed at stealing customers from Juniper. Cisco’s shares added 4.9 per cent this week to $16.62.Banking shares staged a recovery following an injection of liquidity for their European counterparts, when the European Central Bank announced a dollar-swap agreement with other central banks.The KBW bank index was up 6.8 per cent, although it is still down by 16 per cent since the beginning of August. Morgan Stanley added 7 per cent this week to $16.45, and Goldman Sachs rose 5.1 per cent to $107.49. But Bank of America cut its gains on the week almost in half on Friday, ending the five days up just 2.9 per cent to $7.23.BofA shares fell 1.4 per cent Friday after Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz said the company was not getting good value, as it sells assets to shore up its capital base and assure investors it can withstand an economic slowdown.Analysts this week also notched down their estimates of the costs of litigation related to writing bad mortgage loans. Glenn Schorr of Nomura said, based on a detailed study of the mortgages in question, losses could be as much as $20bn, well below previous estimates of $40bn.

The bank also paid a regular dividend on its preferred stock.Goldman Sachs also rose 3.7 per cent to $107.97.Earlier, European banks stocks had soared after central banks committed to action to provide dollar liquidity.But Capital One Financial was down 0.2 per cent at $43.46 on fears that weak macroeconomic data had not filtered through to a reduction in spending by its credit card holders.New England bank People’s United Financial was flat at $12.43 as Goldman initiated coverage of north-eastern banks with a “sell” rating on the stock.Goldman said north-eastern banks were “as good as it gets” in the financial sector, given the low mortgage and default rate in the prosperous region, but worried that People’s United’s stock price implied optimistic capital deployment and value creation.Netflix fell 15.6 per cent to $176.20 after the online group cut its forecast for physical DVD subscribers, as a change in pricing structure took effect.The group projected that DVD-only subscribers would reach just 2.2m by the end of September, 25 per cent fewer than the forecast it made in July. It also lowered its forecast for streaming-only subscribers from 10m to 9.8m.The fall in projected customer growth pushed the stock beneath $200 for the first time since March.“Management have clearly underestimated the impact of the price hike for the combined service,” said James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities. But he said the stock price fall might be an overreaction, as “the vast majority of Netflix growth came from its streaming-only package”.Aircraft manufacturer Textron rose 4.1 per cent to $17.44 as investors continued to be impressed by the potential for earnings-per-share growth from a debt-juggling operation announced on Wednesday.Textron will issue debt to buy back outstanding convertible bonds. Credit Suisse calculations suggest the diluted share count will fall 12 per cent if Textron is able to retire all of the outstanding convertible bonds.That would raise earnings per share at the cost of a hit to earnings per share this year from higher interest payments on the newly issued debt.But Credit Suisse analyst Julian Mitchell said the group, which relies heavily on defence spending, was unlikely to deliver sales growth. “Our scenario work indicates that Textron has less than average upside in a low growth scenario, which investors seem to believe is the most probable, and higher than average downside in a bear scenario,” he told clients.The strong run in semiconductor shares, which has seen stocks such as Micron up as much as 15 per cent this week, ran out of pace just as JPMorgan urged investors to buy into the momentum.“Semis starting to – finally – break out. Time to gas up the minivan and climb on board,” JPMorgan analyst Christopher Danely wrote to clients, but the Philadelphia semiconductor index underperformed the S&P 500 on Thursday, and Micron dropped 2.2 per cent to $7.04.Life insurer Lincoln National Corporation, up 8.2 per cent at $19.78, rose more than any other stock in the S&P 500. But the stock is still underperforming peers, down 31 per cent in the quarter to date, compared with 23 per cent for the group, as its portfolio makes it sensitive to equity markets and low interest rates, according to Andrew Kligerman at UBS.Tenet Healthcare bounced 6.2 per cent to $4.77 but remains in the red for the week, after poor earnings results.Higher than expected inflation figures for August led to concerns the Fed might delay further easing. There were also signs weak macro data were working their way through to earnings expectations.
29;TXT;Textron Inc;2011-09-08T15:42:22Z;US manufacturers feel weight of baby boomers;;The US’s biggest industrial companies face an average bill of at least $100m each over the next five years as they struggle to fill the skills gaps left by the looming retirement of “baby boomer” factory workers, according to a survey of manufacturers to be released today.The survey by The Nielsen Company of 100 top executives at US manufacturing companies underlines the scale of the demographic problem facing the US economy. In recent decades, apprenticeships and workplace training have been gradually downgraded, to the extent that many manufacturers now complain they cannot find the skilled workers they need in spite of stubbornly high unemployment.Mechanics and engineers from the baby-boom generation – born in the two decades following the second world war – formed the backbone of the US’s industrial workforce from the 1960s onwards. However, the first baby boomers become eligible for retirement this year, raising the spectre that the skills gap could worsen sharply in the next few years.Some 55 per cent of industrial companies with annual revenues of at least $1bn expect skills shortages prompted by retirements to cost them at least $100m in the next five years, they said in a survey conducted for Advanced Technology Services, a manufacturing equipment maintenance company based in Peoria, Illinois, whose clients include companies such as Caterpillar, BorgWarner, Honeywell, Eaton and Textron.Most of the costs will be accounted for by recruiting, training and overtime costs, said Jeff Owens, ATS chief executive. He said the costs also take into account the likelihood that equipment would not be operated for part of the time because of a lack of qualified maintenance staff. “You’re talking about falling productivity and a shorter life for fixed assets in factories,” Mr Owens said.Rick Stephens, senior vice-president of human resources at Boeing, the aircraft maker, said his company is well aware of the problem. “Like most aerospace companies, we have a workforce that is more on the mature side,” he said.Mr Stephens said Boeing spends about $80m annually in workforce training. “We’ve also significantly increased spending in the past year to train up new employees to ensure they’re qualified to go into the production environment,” he said.The problem of the looming retirement of highly experienced workers, Mr Stephens said, has been aggravated by the fact that new recruits tend to be far less technically skilled than entry-level workers were decades ago. In response, Boeing recently doubled its introductory training course from 6-7 weeks to 13 weeks.Mr Owens said the recession had enabled manufacturers to avoid facing the retirement issue. “Companies have put this problem off for a long time because it’s not been pressing,” he said. “But many companies are starting to discover how urgent it is when they look at the average age of their workforce.”The survey also found that 45 per cent of companies are encouraging older workers to delay their retirements as they face the prospect of losing skilled staff, while employees are keen to rebuild their recession-hit pension funds.“The folks that we expected to retire, the age has been extended a bit because of the economy’s effects on peoples’ savings and retirement plans,” said Mr Stephens.Mr Owens said that could help postpone the problem, but could not overcome it. He also noted that older skilled workers tend to be less productive.“Manufacturers have assumed they can simply hire people when they need them, but when they start to look, they realise how difficult it is to hire.” Half of the survey respondents said they had 11 or more open positions for skilled workers, with one-third having more than 20 unfilled vacancies.

Marathon Oil was up 3.4 per cent to $34.06 while Peabody Energy added 2.2 per cent to $60.69.But this failed to prevent the S&P 500 edging lower, losing 0.1 per cent to 1,337.88 as investors worried about which direction the markets would now turn after the 5.6 per cent jump in the S&P last week – the best week of gains in the index for two years.The index is now just 1.9 per cent away from a three- year high and is well above its 100-day moving average.Financial stocks were some of the worst hit by these nerves, also hurt by news that Portugal’s credit rating had been cut to “junk” and that Citigroup had cut its price target on a number of regional banks.Morgan Stanley was down 2.6 per cent to $23.15 while Comerica, a regional lender, lost 3 per cent to $34.32. The S&P financial index was down 0.8 per cent, paring some of the 5.9 per cent gains seen last week. The KBW banking index fell 1.2 per cent.The industrial sector was the next worst performing in the session, not helped by news that factory orders had risen by less than expected in May.Textron, the maker of Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters, led the losses, falling 5 per cent to $22.74 while Cummins declined 1.6 per cent to $105.69.The S&P industrial index was down 0.6 per cent, paring some of the 6.4 per cent gains last week.But most of the remaining sectors on the S&P saw little movement and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 12,569.34. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent to 2,825.77.This pause follows the best weekly gains in two years on both these indices last week.The upswing came as the indices bounced up off their 200-day moving average and investors cheered a perceived improvement in the Greece situation.The markets were also looking ahead to the earnings season, which starts next week and is expected to be relatively strong.Analysts are expecting a healthy 11.9 per cent rise in earnings from the previous year for S&P 500 companies, according to data complied by Bloomberg. This would mark the seventh straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the index.But despite an assumption that second-quarter earnings would be healthy, there is some concern that guidances for the full year will be lowered due to the “soft patch” in the US economy over the past two months.Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, argued that the S&P 500 will reach a ceiling at 1,350 before running back down to 1,250 again in the coming months, thanks partly to lower guidances.But he goes on to argue that there will be a late rally towards the end of the year, which will see the S&P finish between 1,370 and 1,400. “In the end, the market wants to go up,” he reassured.In other company news Ameron surged 28.3 per cent to $85.05 after National Oilwell Varco said it would buy the fibreglass pipe manufacturer in a deal valued at $772m. National Oilwell Varco was up 2.2 per cent to $80.02.Netflix led the gains on the S&P 500, jumping 8.1 per cent to $289.63 after saying that it was expanding its video streaming service to 43 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.Immucor, the biotechnology company, added 30.2 per cent to $26.99 after agreeing to be bought by private equity group TPG Capital for a fully diluted equity value of $1.97bn.Baidu, the US-listed Chinese search engine, was up 1.8 per cent to $145.87 on news that it will team up with Microsoft to create an English-language search.
31;TXT;Textron Inc;2011-05-03T00:14:55Z;Head of Cessna Aircraft retires;;Jack Pelton has retired as head of Textron’s Cessna Aircraft unit and the company said that Scott Donnelly, chief executive of the industrial conglomerate, would run the business until it found a successor.Cessna, one of the world’s biggest makers of business jets, slashed its work force and cut costs during the recession as wealthy individuals and corporations stopped buying aircraft and orders from fractional ownership companies dried up.In a statement, Mr Donnelly thanked Mr Pelton for his work at the company since 2000, but on a conference call last month he gave a frank assessment of the unit’s performance of late, describing it as “disappointing”.“We have taken a number of actions over the past couple of years at Cessna but clearly have more to do. I assure you, we’re taking the necessary actions to restore our profitability,” Mr Donnelly told analysts.In the first three months of the year, Cessna lost $38m on revenues of $556m. Cessna, which makes everything from golf carts to helicopters, reported net income of $29m on revenues of $2.5bn.In a note to clients, Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse noted that the timing of the move was surprising given that Cessna will host an analysts’ day on May 9. “We think investors will view Mr Pelton’s departure in a bad light,” Mr Mitchell wrote.

This is the fastest organic growth pace since at least 2006.”He said that last year’s GDP growth was due to transitory factors but the main reason for the improvement in 2011 was slower private sector deleveraging.A report from the Institute of Supply Management showed US manufacturing grew in line with expectations in December, reaching a seven-month high.But Ian Shepherdson at High Frequency Economics said: “Remember that the ISM has overstated growth over the past year as it has nothing to say about the struggling small business sector.”US markets will also be affected by growth in emerging markets, and so the Chinese purchasing managers’ index was closely watched by traders.The Chinese PMI edged lower in December from November. But even though the measure fell short of forecasts, investors welcomed the news as a sign that China was less likely to take measures to try to control growth.The S&P 500 industrials index gained 0.7 per cent. with Boeing adding 1.8 per cent to $66.40 and Textron rose 1.6 per cent to $24.01.Elsewhere, Expedia lost 1.2 per cent to $24.79 after the travel website stopped sales of tickets for American Airlines flights. Expedia is the second large online travel agency to fall out with American Airlines, after Orbitz Worldwide stopped selling the carrier’s seats in December.Expedia’s rival Priceline.com increased 4.1 per cent to $415.99 but Orbitz Worldwide sank 3.4 per cent to $5.40. AMR Corp, which owns American, was up 1.7 per cent at $7.92.Meanwhile, Alcoa added 2.7 per cent to $15.80 after analysts at Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock from “hold” to “buy”, saying aluminium prices could rise and the metal producer was showing signs of operational stability.

It beat expectations in its third quarter as same-store sales rose 7 per cent. It also raised its earnings forecast for the full year to a range above analysts’ expectations.Durable goods orders unexpectedly fell in October, down 3.3 per cent, in the biggest drop since January 2009. The jump in September was revised higher to an increase of 5 per cent.But S&P 500 industrials still managed to rise the most in the wider indices, up 2.1 per cent, with Caterpillar up 2.5 per cent to $84.69, Textron up 4.2 per cent to $22.44 and Cummins up 3.9 per cent to $98.65.Deere fell 0.1 per cent to $76.23, even though the maker of farm equipment issued a profit forecast for 2011 that fell short of analyst estimates. It beat expectations in its fourth quarter as sales shot up 35 per cent from the same period a year earlier.Shares in Dynegy rose 2.6 per cent to $5.13 after it was reported that it might get an offer of more than $6 a share from Seneca Capital and another investor.On Tuesday Dynegy ended an agreement to sell itself to Blackstone Group.
34;TXT;Textron Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
35;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-11-17T19:30:10Z;Chinese airspace move excites producers;;China’s decision to open its airspace below 4,000m to civilian aircraft has been hailed as transformational by international producers of helicopters and light aircraft, who expect a rush of wealthy Chinese buyers in the coming years.Industry executives and analysts, however, say the decision is a signal that China intends to develop its domestic helicopter and light aircraft industry quickly, in tandem with its ambitious large aircraft production programme.Following the news this week that China will gradually open its low altitude airspace, Lutz Bertling, the head of Eurocopter, the world’s largest civil helicopter maker, told Reuters he expects China will move from making civil helicopters in joint ventures and under licence to producing its own from scratch within the decade.In a research report, Sinolink Securities, a Chinese brokerage, put the expected helicopter purchases in China at more than 3,300 over the next decade and said if Chinese airspace was only opened below 1,000m there would likely be sales of at least 2,300 light fixed-wing aircraft.Sinolink did not provide an estimate for how many more small aircraft would be sold with the opening of airspace up to 4,000m. But industry executives said they expect a rush of interest and that sales of such aircraft would likely far exceed helicopter sales in the coming years.Beijing has not said whether it will open airspace above 4,000m to non-military, non-commercial airline aircraft – a move that would likely provide a huge boost to international producers of business jets, which fly at higher altitudes.China’s military controls the country’s airspace and all civilian and private flights must be approved by military and civil aviation authorities far in advance, a process that sometimes takes weeks or longer.Because of this there are less than 150 helicopters in the whole of China, according to aviation consultancy Frost & Sullivan, compared with tens of thousands in the US.The total number of “general aviation” aircraft, including all non-military aircraft not operated by commercial airlines, in China was less than 900 by the end of 2008, according to Chinese state media reports, compared with 220,000 in the US.“This is the beginning of a new chapter in China’s general aviation development,” said Martin Lin, China president of Textron, the company that owns Bell Helicopters, Lycoming Motors and Cessna Aircraft.“This is not only a huge boost for us but also for Chinese manufacturers who will speed up design and production capacity to meet demand,” he told the Financial Times. The Chinese companies that are most likely to be benefit from the opening of the lower airspace are almost all subsidiaries of state-owned Aviation Industry Corp of China (Avic).Besides Textron and Eurocopter, the international companies that could receive a boost include Piper Aircraft, Hawker Beechcraft, Sikorsky, AgustaWestland, Turbomeca Engines and Russian Helicopter Holding Company.Apart from wanting to support a domestic aviation industry, Beijing has decided to open its lower airspace now because it realises the economic and social benefits outweigh the security concerns of the military.Following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, which killed nearly 100,000 people in mostly mountainous terrain, the government was confronted with the country’s urgent need for medical rescue helicopters and air ambulances.Other parts of the economy where there is huge demand include flight training, agricultural applications, such as crop spraying and tourism, and wealthy individuals who want to fly in their own planes and helicopters.Industry experts say China’s aviation infrastructure will need a rapid upgrade to meet the expected surge in demand.“There is a great demand in China for private aircraft and quasi-commercial flights but the infrastructure is not currently up to the task,” said Martin Craigs, president of Aerospace Forum Asia. Pilot training would also be a “huge issue”, he said.China’s desire to build up its own helicopter and light aircraft industry is part of a wider plan to become a global aerospace power.On Tuesday, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (Comac) said it had signed deals with domestic state-controlled airlines to build 100 of its C919 160-seat jets.Comac was established with the specific task of trying to design and build large jets to reduce the China’s dependency on Boeing and Airbus and eventually compete with them internationally.However, international industry executives attending the Zhuhai Airshow in southern China expressed doubts about the significance of the C919 orders.The C919 is scheduled to make its first test flight in 2014 and first delivery by 2016. Industry executives said at this stage the Comac orders seemed to be only statements of intent rather than firm sales.
36;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-11-08T01:41:24Z;USAF $3bn helicopter order sparks concern;;The US Air Force is considering making unusual use of an obscure 1930s law to close off a $3bn-plus helicopter order from competition, sparking concern among some industry executives.Government spending watchdogs have suggested the move could set a precedent for increased military procurement without competitive bidding.The contract, known as the Common Vertical Lift Support Platform, is to provide about 90 helicopters for surveillance and response around sensitive sites such as missile silos, and VIP transport around Washington DC, replacing 1960s-era Bell “Hueys”.The USAF has not made a decision on the order, but defence analysts and executives believe it is looking at buying Sikorsky Blackhawks, manufactured by United Technologies, from the US Army.Under the terms of the 1932 Economy Act, it could do so without opening up the purchase to competition, providing it can meet the regulatory requirement to show that its purchase “cannot be obtained as conveniently or economically by contracting directly with a private source”.If the deal is not opened to competition, it would be a blow to AgustaWestland, owned by Finmeccanica of Italy, and to Bell, owned by Textron of the US.Both companies have helicopters they believe would meet the USAF’s requirements.Dan Hill, a vice-president of AgustaWestland, said: “It would be extraordinary for a contract this big not to be opened up to competition, using this Depression-era legislation.”Citizens Against Government Waste, a lobby group, described the possibility as a “desperate attempt” to circumvent the defence department’s attempts to make procurement more competitive and cost-effective.“If you never have a competition, then how will anyone know if the taxpayer is getting the best deal?” it asked.The USAF said: “All options are under review and no decisions have been made.”Jim McAleese, a defence consultant, said: “It would be very unusual to have a brand new programme that is not currently needed in the immediate fight in Iraq and Afghanistan that is worth several billion dollars and find that it is sole sourced.”The US Army is buying about 74 Sikorsky Blackhawk helicopters a year, at a cost of about $19m each, under a multiyear contract that is projected to run through 2015.The heightened interest in the CVLSP in part reflects the dearth of military projects available for helicopter makers.The planned multibillion-dollar contract for a new fleet of presidential helicopters was cancelled last year after the cost soared, and a new contest is progressing slowly.
37;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-10-20T19:20:08Z;Boeing rejects recession fears;;US manufacturers have rejected fears of a global slide into recession with a series of strong results and positive statements, showing the benefit of strong growth in emerging economies in Asia and the Middle East.Aerospace and capitals goods companies reporting third-quarter earnings, including Boeing and United Technologies, forecast that full-year profits would be at the top end of previous forecast ranges or higher.Boeing, the world’s second-biggest aircraft maker by sales, raised its forecast for the year by about 5 per cent, on strong demand for commercial aircraft.“Both passenger and freighter markets [are] rebounding more sharply than originally anticipated,” said Jim McNerney, chief executive.He said the growth was fuelled by increasing air travel globally, but he stressed that emerging markets continued to show the strongest recovery.Net income in the quarter was $837m, or $1.12 per share, against a loss last time and beating analysts’ average expectation of $1.05.Boeing booked 257 orders in the quarter with just 36 cancellations, compared with its net order book addition of 79 aircraft previously.Its contract backlog stands at 3,401 aircraft, valued at $255bn.Mr McNerney said in a statement that the orders reflected “improved overall market confidence”.United Technologies, which makes Pratt & Whitney aero engines and Sikorsky helicopters, also reported rising orders, and said it expected earnings per share of $4.70 for the full year, at the top of its previous forecast range, even though its sales projection was unchanged.Third-quarter earnings were $1.30, up 14 per cent, and again ahead of analysts’ forecasts.The company said year-to-date equipment orders in China were up more than 15 per cent, excluding currency effects.Eaton, the industrial equipment and components manufacturer, raised its forecast of full-year earnings by 10 per cent, thanks to better-than-expected second-half growth and looked forward to stronger markets for all its businesses in 2011.Sandy Cutler, chief executive, said emerging economies, where Eaton makes about 25 per cent of its sales, were particularly healthy, but US sales were also up 8 per cent year on year.“Among investors there have been concerns that things are starting to cool off and we won’t see earnings momentum going into next year. But we are seeing abnormally strong activity for the time of year.”Textron, the manufacturer of Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters, made a loss of $0.17 per share in the quarter, because of a write-off linked to its Canadian finance unit, but it raised its forecast for underlying earnings from continuing operations.
38;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-09-23T21:12:59Z;US investors shaken by jobless news;S&P 500 housebuilders index edges lower;US stocks slid back under the key 1,130 level led by losses for financials and industrials after initial jobless claims unexpectedly climbed for the first time in four weeks.The S&P 500 closed down 0.8 per cent to 1,124.83, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.7 per cent to close at 10,662.42 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent lower to close at 2,327.08.The S&P 500 broke out of its summer trading range, rising above 1,130, on Monday and analysts have been watching to see whether the new level will hold. After a day of choppy trading, all 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 fell, with four down more than 1 per cent.Initial claims for unemployment benefits increased by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 465,000, compared with a consensus forecast for claims to remain steady at 450,000.“[The market falling] is curious as we find it hard to believe that anyone would be surprised by weaker-than-expected jobs data,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist of Miller Tabak.“The labour market remains weak and while any number of people continue to suggest, as they have for several months now, that robust hiring is just around the corner, such job growth simply isn’t materialising,” he added.Investors shrugged off some positive economic data. Sales of existing, rather than new, homes climbed 7.6 per cent in August, just above analyst estimates.But at an adjusted annual rate of 4.13m this was still almost 20 per cent lower than this time last year.The S&P 500 housebuilders index dropped 2 per cent. DR Horton was down by 2.5 per cent to $10.62 and Toll Brothers lost 1.6 per cent to $18.25.Leading indicators – a compendium of forward-looking economic data some of which have already been released – was also slightly positive, rising 0.3 per cent, more than the 0.1 per cent forecast.Financials, which led the fallers on Wednesday, also headed up the sell-off on Thursday after Bank of America cut its profit projections for banks.The S&P 500 financials sector fell 2 per cent with Goldman Sachs losing 2.1 per cent to $144.91, Citigroup dropping 2.1 per cent to $3.80 and JPMorgan Chase declining 2.1 per cent to $39.10.Industrials also dropped with conglomerate Textron lower by 2.8 per cent to $19.60 and aircraft manufacturer Boeing sinking 2 per cent to $62.65.In earnings news, Red Hat jumped 9 per cent to $40.07 after sales of its software soared.The world’s biggest provider of Linux programmes reported profit of 19 cents per share, above forecasts of 18 cents as revenue rose 20 per cent to $219.8m.Red Hat led the risers in the information technology sector, which was up 0.7 per cent, the most in the broader index.There was mixed news from retailers reporting results. Homeware seller Bed Bath & Beyond rose 3.2 per cent to $43.40 after it beat profit and sales expectations and raised its full-year forecast. Net income rose to 70 cents per share in the second quarter compared with estimates of 63 cents per share.The retailer now predicts earnings per share for the full year will rise by about 20 per cent compared with a previous forecast of a 15 per cent increase, saying it was “cautiously optimistic”.But elsewhere in retail, the picture was less rosy, with Rite Aid dropping 13.6 per cent to 95 cents.The pharmacy chain posted a second-quarter loss of 16 cents per share, excluding exceptionals, which was in line with analyst forecasts. It said same- store sales in the quarter fell 1.5 per cent.The company lowered its full-year forecast blaming a “sluggish economy”.Tiffany dropped 1.9 per cent to $44.69 after the luxury jeweller was downgraded from “neutral” to “sell” by Goldman Sachs, citing tough sales comparisons, slowing margin tailwinds and higher marketing costs in the short term.Among restaurant chains, DineEquity said same-store sales at its Applebee’s restaurants had increased 2.7 per cent in the first 11 weeks of the quarter, sending its shares up 1.7 per cent to $41.25.
39;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-09-21T18:02:03Z;From grey operations to good business;;"Makers of big corporate aircraft turned out in force last week to display their wares at Jet Expo, Russia’s business aviation show held in Moscow.The Russian market has ridden out the financial storms relatively well. “We are impressed with the resilience of the Russian business community and its prospects for growth,” Sean McGeough, Hawker Beechcraft’s president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in the run-up to the show.Fellow Wichita manufacturer Cessna’s Citation Mustang, new CJ4 and CJ3 were kept busy doing demonstration flights. And Italy’s Piaggio Aero said it was aiming for first delivery of its fast – 400 knot – and shapely twin turboprop, the P180 Avanti II, early next year once it gains Russian certification.The show was, however, quieter than in previous years. And the country is still a tough nut for western companies to crack. Officially, at least. Many operators have been doing unofficial work in Russia. It’s a similar situation to that in the Middle East, which I highlighted a few weeks ago.The problem of grey operations is big elsewhere, too. Aoife O’Sullivan of Gates and Partners, the aviation law firm, has drawn attention to how widespread the practice is in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. The word is that the authorities in Russia and elsewhere know very well the scale of the problem, and can point to every illegitimate operation.One jet operator that is not following the grey route is Austria-based Jetalliance. Its deal to take 49 per cent of Aeroflot Plus, Aeroflot’s private aviation subsidiary, makes it the first western company to operate – legitimately – within Russia. Lukas Lichtner-Hoyer, Jetalliance founder and chief executive, told me in Vienna this month that he was hoping to have a CJ3 and a Sovereign on the air operator’s certificate next month. “They will be the first western-origin planes on the charter market in Russia,” he said.In fact, grey is a description that would be hard to apply to Jetalliance. Looking around the state-of-the-art recording studio that Mr Lichtner-Hoyer is building for his own rock band – above the garage that looks after his racing Porsches – is enough to demonstrate that. But even within the confines of private aviation, he has some radical ideas. Look out for a profile of Jetalliance soon.I also met the chief of GlobeAir, another Austrian company. One of the criticisms often levelled by the business community at aviation companies is that they are set up by pilots or aviation enthusiasts – who let their passion overwhelm their business sense. Like the Jetalliance chief, GlobeAir chief executive Bernhard Fragner is a pilot. But, also like Mr Lichtner-Hoyer, he keeps a very close eye on the figures.GlobeAir is in that very difficult field – air-taxi operations. It initially had bandwagon jumpers aplenty, but in the wake of the global credit crunch and especially the collapse in 2008 of Florida-based DayJet, which had laid plans for a fleet of 1,400 Eclipse 500 jets, there have been as many people saying that the model will never work.But Mr Fragner, who started with three Cessna Mustangs and now has a fleet of six, insists he is already making a profit.This is a subject dear to the heart of everyone at the Light Jets Europe conference hosted this week by Oxford Airport – or London Oxford Airport as it calls itself.The event has just transformed itself from the Very Light Jets event – understandably, given the loss of credibility that resulted from the bankruptcy of VLJ pioneer Eclipse Aviation, along with others, such as Adam Aircraft Industries, which have fallen by the wayside. Many companies set out their stall in this sector. Yet the only manufacturers now making aircraft that might even remotely be said to fall into the category are the long-established ones – Cessna and Embraer. And the Embraer Phenom 100 is a bit on the big side to fit comfortably into the class.Cessna was always canny, though. Even as it launched its Mustang programme to steal the air from under the Eclipse’s wings, the company called its offering an “entry-level jet”. That strategy worked, as it was not so tainted by the apparent failure of the VLJ dream.However, Eclipse Aerospace has certainly done extensive work in updating the limited jets that the original Eclipse Aviation manufactured. It says it definitely will resume production; time will tell about that.It also has to hope that the global financial climate will be more clement than now. It seems that in spite of an apparently long waiting list for Mustangs, if you want one now, you can have one now.But that, at least, made Mr Fragner’s life easier when he wanted to upscale his operations, making it simpler to react to growing demand quickly rather than having to put in orders far ahead and just hoping the work will be there when the aircraft arrive.Trusting to an uncertain future is something that he has learnt to do. I met him on a Thursday. He said that on Monday morning there were no bookings for that week: none at all. But by Tuesday morning, the week was fully booked. And that week was not extraordinary. According to Mr Fragner, 90 per cent of bookings are made just two days before the date of travel. So he really has to keep his nerve.That is pretty much the leitmotif of the industry. Keep your nerve and, if the fundamentals are in place, trust that it will turn out OK.That is not the best practice for pilots, though. Mr Fragner says he is a very conservative pilot. There is no room for risk when he is in the left-hand seat. Nor, indeed, when any of his pilots are doing the same job. I guess it’s good for him, and for the industry, that he is more of a risk taker when behind a desk.Uncertainty continuesThe outlook for the sector as a whole is still cloudy, the latest report from JP Morgan confirms. Uncertainty about the economy as a whole is holding back demand, forcing business aircraft makers to eat further into their backlogs.Dassault Aviation, the French maker of large twin- and triple-engined aircraft, is fighting to stop orders falling away but says it expects to see record production levels this year.Demand for large jets is holding up better than for small- and medium-sized ones, JP Morgan’s September Business Jet Monthly says – “but we’re not ready to say that large business jets are out of the wood”. On a more positive note, however, the report says that both used jet prices and utilisation are edging up.Morgan Stanley, commenting on the outlook for Cessna parent Textron, also adds a guardedly positive note. Rejecting the market’s apparent expectation of a “multi-year downturn in biz jets with no rebound in sight”, it says it believes “the question remains when, not if, a biz jet recovery occurs”.It may not be time yet to break out the champagne. Or even the fizzy lemonade. But many in the industry are taking heart from a number of signs that point to a lifting of the gloom."
40;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-09-17T05:21:35Z;Bell Helicopter banks on Chinese tycoons;;At Guangzhou Suilian helicopter pilot school, business is busier than ever, with its six trainers booked solid almost every day.“Learning to fly a helicopter is becoming a new hobby in China as rich people are getting tired of golf and cars,” says Guan Xiwen, general manger of the school in Guangzhou. “We have to turn down students sometimes.”This new-found interest is fuelling a burgeoning helicopter market in the world’s most populous nation. While the number of crafts sold globally increased just 7 per cent in 2008 and 5.7 per cent in 2009, China’s fleet grew by more than a quarter from 108 in 2008 to 137 this year, according to Frost & Sullivan, the consultancy. Zhang Yue, the tycoon who controls Broad Air Conditioning, pioneered the trend by securing the country’s first private helicopter pilot’s licence in 1997.The number of helicopters in commercial use in the country is expected to triple to about 450 by 2015, Frost & Sullivan says. This would make China the fastest growing market in the world, outpacing India and Russia.One company banking on that potential is Bell Helicopter, one of the world’s oldest and biggest helicopter manufacturers.The US company, which has sold just 20 helicopters in China since entering the market in 1984, including several to Mr Zhang, expects demand from the country’s nouveau riche to lift annual sales to 10 to 15 craft – at a list price of $6.5m each – in the next few years. Bell is set to announce its first Chinese order for the 429, its latest model, next week.“The rich people who have enjoyed luxury cars are looking for the next step, which will be something aviation-related,” says CM Hwang, Asia Pacific business development manager at Bell. “This is great growth potential for us.”The rising interest comes as Beijing is looking at lowering airport charges for helicopters, according to Bell. Local media have reported that the government is considering opening up more low-altitude airspace to accommodate helicopters.For Bell, an arm of conglomerate Textron, opportunities in China are well-timed because rivals such as Eurocopter and AgustaWestland have been catching up fast in recent years. Bell once controlled about half of the world’s commercial helicopter market, but its market share has slipped to 30 -40 per cent currently.Bell has also been attracting business from utility companies such as State Grid. The country’s biggest power network operator, which uses helicopters to patrol its power lines, is Bell’s single biggest customer in China having bought five craft.Bell faces heated competition in China, with at least nine other companies, including state-owned giant China Aviation Industry Corporation and most international manufacturers, also present.As business improves, Bell and its rivals are facing a new problem: a lack of pilots. China currently has fewer than 650 licenced helicopter pilots.The teachers at Suilian will be kept busy for quite a while.

The better-than-expected headline figures on manufacturing and unemployment sparked a four-session rally, but details in the reports created concerns about the pace of the economic recovery.The S&P 500 financial sector slid 2.4 per cent on the back of worries about European banks. Bank of America fell 2.2 per cent to $13.21, Citigroup was lower by 2.1 per cent to $3.83 and JPMorgan Chase lost 2.3 per cent to $38.28.

But it warned rising costs would put pressure on earnings in the third quarter, which the company forecast to come in between 57 and 63 cents a share, below analysts’ est­imates of 74 cents. Its shares fell 2.7 per cent to $46.50.Sara Lee, the food and household group, was also down 0.7 per cent to $14.37 after issuing a forecast that fell short of expectations. It said earnings for the year ending June 2011 would be between 88 cents and 95 cents a share compared with a consensus forecast of $1.02. Fourth-quarter earnings also missed expectations after wheat, meat and coffee prices rose, squeezing profit in its North American retail division.Estée Lauder also fell after forecasting earnings for 2011 below the average analyst estimate. The cosmetics company said profit would be between $2.80 and $3.05 a share, excluding some items, compared with the consensus forecast of $3.19. Shares dropped 2.6 per cent to $58.80 after it also missed expectations for its fourth quarter.Brinker International’s Chilis chain and the Wendy’s-Arby’s Group Arby’s chain suffered from declining sales in their restaurants.

44;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-08-02T14:29:00Z;US factory output slows in July;;Growth in the the US manufacturing sector slowed in July for the third month running, adding to evidence that the economic recovery is cooling.The Institute of Supply Management said on Monday that its index of factory activity had fallen to 55.5 in July from 56.2 in June. It was the 12th consecutive month that manufacturing expanded, but was the lowest reading since last December.New orders and production stalled in July, while employment and rising inventories supported the sector. Although more than half of the 18 industries tracked by ISM reported factory expansion, executives complained that a slow economy had “killed” orders for new machinery and that retailers were “unwilling to gamble on inventory”.The data comes as economists debate the prospect of a double-dip recession, following last Friday’s government report showing economic growth slowing to an annual rate of 2.4 per cent. Those figures offered a mixed picture for manufacturing, with a surge of foreign imports denting output but business demand remaining strong.In spite of signs of a slowdown, last month several US manufacturers signalled continued confidence, with manufacturers such as United Technologies, Textron and Eaton raising their profit forecasts.Gregory Hayes, chief financial officer at United Technologies, which produces air conditioners and elevators, said he saw “signs that the worst is behind us” thanks to a rise in revenues and new orders.Drew Industries, which makes recreational vehicles, said on Monday that output usually slowed in July because of plants shutting down for a week, but that generally the manufacturer had been “delighted” by the strong demand for trailers and RVs compared with last year.US manufacturing activity in July appeared to outpace China’s factory sector, in which expansion slowed to its lowest level since February 2009 as the government curbed lending.A separate report released on Monday by KPMG showed that optimism among Chinese manufacturers had sunk to its lowest point since January 2009. Meanwhile, US manufacturers are feeling more hopeful that cash-hoarding companies will ramp up new orders.

Caterpillar and 3M are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Worries over weak private sector job creation, uncertain equity markets and a moribund construction industry have prompted many observers to take an increasingly gloomy view of the US’s economic recovery.With Europe’s financial woes and signs of slowing growth in China, many are concerned at the prospect of a double-dip recession.However, the US industrial sector is striking a quite different tone. The results from Caterpillar and 3M came a day after United Technologies, Eaton Corp and Textron issued results well ahead of analysts’ expectations.“While there are significant economic concerns around the world that we are watching closely, orders have continued to outpace our shipments, and we expect to increase production in the second half of the year,” said Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar’s chief executive.Caterpillar made a net profit in the quarter of $707m or $1.09 per share, up from $371m or 60 cents a share in the same period last year and beating analysts’ consensus forecast of about 85 cents per share.Caterpillar’s revenues in the second quarter were $10.4bn, up from $8bn last year and above expectations of about $9.8bn.The company increased its outlook for the full year, saying it expected 2010 profits of $3.15-$3.85 per share on revenues of $39bn-$42bn, up from its prior forecast of $2.50-$3.25 per share and revenues of $38bn-$42bn.Meanwhile, 3M made a net profit of $1.12bn or $1.54 per share in the second quarter, up from $783m or $1.12 per share last year and ahead of analysts’ expectations of $1.48 per share. Revenues rose to $6.7bn from $5.7bn a year earlier.The company expects full-year earnings of $5.65-$5.80 per share, up from its prior projection of $5.40-$5.60.“There will possibly be a period of slower growth in end markets later this year,” said George Buckley, chief executive of 3M. “This isn’t a “double-dip” per se. It’s just a soft spot – very normal as economic growth takes a breather for a while.”
46;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-07-22T02:04:22Z;US manufacturers bullish on earnings;;A clutch of US industrial companies on Wednesday boosted their earnings outlook for the year and reported increased quarterly revenues, suggesting a vein of underlying strength to the manufacturing economy.In past months, weak jobs numbers from the US, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and indications that industrial production in Asia is beginning to slow have all weighed on international equity markets.But second-quarter earnings have offered some more positive indicators.United Technologies, Eaton Corp and Textron – which make a wide range of goods from aircraft engines to E-Z-Go golf carts – handily beat the benchmarks set by analysts.Textron closed up 8.7 per cent to $19.65, Eaton rose 5.9 per cent to $73.14 and UTC was down 0.8 per cent to $67.03.Since 2008, companies have focused on slashing costs to cope with tumbling demand. That helped them to sustain margins and profits, but investors have been waiting for signs of sales growth that would indicate the next phase in the fitful economic recovery.At UTC second-quarter organic revenues rose for the first time in over a year and total revenues climbed 5 per cent to $13.9bn. Orders also improved at units like Otis, the elevator company, which tend to recover later in the economic cycle.Net profit and earnings per share were both up 14 per cent on the same period in 2009, at $1.1bn and $1.20 respectively.“UTC’s results this quarter reflect strong execution in an improved end market environment,” said Louis Chênevert, UTC’s chief executive. “The return of revenue growth, combined with our cost reduction actions, led to solid earnings growth.”Meanwhile, Eaton said sales grew 16 per cent to $3.4bn in the quarter and were 9 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 2010 “reflecting the continued expansion in our markets around the world”. Net profit climbed to $226m compared to $29m in 2009, giving earnings per share of $1.33 compared to 17 cents.“As we survey our end markets, the year is shaping up to be better than we had forecast in April,” said Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive. “We now anticipate our overall end markets will grow by 8 per cent versus our earlier forecast of 6 per cent.Still, Mr Cutler cautioned that “you are going to see fairly different growth rates for companies depending on what their mix of businesses is…Those that have a significant portfolio of late cycle businesses probably won’t recover entirely till 2011.”And cost cutting remains the key driver of profitability. UTC now expects earnings per share of $4.60 to $4.70 in 2010, up from earlier forecasts of $4.50 to $4.65 thanks to careful cost controls.Textron raised its full year earnings per share forecasts to 55-65 cents, from 30-50 cents. It also increased its sales estimate to $10.9bn for the full year, up from $10.5bn.For the quarter, Textron made a net profit of $82m compared with a $58m loss last year, giving earnings per share of $0.27 compared to a 23 cents loss. Revenues in the quarter rose 3.7 per cent to $2.7bn.Executives struck other notes of caution. Scott Donnelly, Textron’s chief executive, said the company was reviewing its outlook for sales of certain business jets in the light of the dip in business confidence in Europe.And UTC said that currency weakness in Europe could create an 8 cents per share translation headwind for the full year and reduced its revenue guidance to about $54bn.Also, Mr Cutler noted that “the rate of economic growth in China has moderated slightly” but added that the company still anticipates “solid global growth continuing during the second half of the year.”To demonstrate its confidence the company raised its guidance for the full year and also increased its quarterly dividend by 16 per cent to $0.58 per share.

The US Conference Board revised its leading economic indicator index for China in April to a rise of only 0.3 per cent from its previously reported 1.7 per cent.“It just demonstrates the current level of risk aversion and fear that a two-month-old piece of data on China, coming out of the US, can spook the markets so much,” said Uri Landesman, president at Platinum Partners, a New York-based hedge fund.He expects trading to remain range-bound in the near term and the S&P to retest support levels at the 1,401 level.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 3.1 per cent to 1,041.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.7 per cent to 9,870.30 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.9 per cent to 2,135.18.The Vix index, a measure of market volatility, was up 21.8 per cent to 35.31.Industrial stocks were some of the hardest hit on Tuesday as worries about the strength of the global economy mounted.Textron, a conglomerate active in the aircraft, defence and industrial sectors, was one of the biggest fallers as it dived 10 per cent to $16.80.Deere & Company, the agricultural equipment maker, lost 5.3 per cent to $55.43, General Electric declined 3.5 per cent to $14.48 and Terex Corp, a commercial equipment manufacturer, dropped 7.4 per cent to $19.03.Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, slid 5.5 per cent to $60.85. The company said late on Monday that it planned to buy out one of its partners in a Chinese joint venture.The materials sector also underperformed the main indices on worries about the strength of demand should the global economy slow down.Titanium Metals Corp lost 9 per cent to $17.82, AK Steel declined 9.4 per cent to $12.07 and Cliffs Natural Resources dropped 10.9 per cent to $48.49.Bank of America dropped 4.4 per cent to $14.57, Wells Fargo fell 4.1 per cent to $25.93 and JPMorgan Chase declined 3.8 per cent to $37.06 following a report by Moody’s arguing that the three largest US debit card issuers may lose a combined $1.38bn in annual revenue from the proposed cap on interchange fees being considered by Congress.Tesla Motors, an electric car company that has yet to make a profit, priced its initial public offering above its forecast range to raise $226m. Its shares were up 40.5 per cent on their first trading day. The maker of the $109,000 Roadster sold 13.3m shares at $17 each after offering them in a range of $14-$16.Zimmer Holdings, the maker of surgical products, was one of the S&P 500’s best performers as it gained 0.1 per cent to $54.60. The stock was raised to “buy” from “neutral” at Goldman Sachs on Tuesday.Barnes & Noble, the book retail chain, fell 19.1 per cent to $13.27 after reporting a fourth-quarter loss that was bigger than analysts had expected.Shares in Emerson Electric, a diversified global technology company, were
3.5 per cent lower to $43.29.The company raised its previous offer for Chloride, a London-listed power solutions group, to 375p per share from the 275p-per- share offer made in April, which was rejected by Chloride. It hopes the move will break up an agreed bid for the Chloride from ABB, the Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering group.Consumer staples stocks, typically seen as a defensive sector, were among the session’s best performers in a falling market. The group was led by Procter & Gamble, which fell 0.5 per cent to $60.32. Clorox was down 1.1 per cent to $62.73 and Johnson & Johnson lost 0.4 per cent to $59.24.General Mills, maker of products such as Lucky Charms and Cheerios cereals, was down 1.3 per cent to $36.90, even after it said it was increasing its quarterly dividend by 14 per cent compared with last quarter to 28 cents per share."
49;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-06-07T18:25:20Z;Clyde Blowers to acquire German rival;;Clyde Blowers, one of the UK’s largest privately owned engineering groups, is spending £125m ($181m) to acquire German manufacturing equipment maker, Automatik Plastic Machinery.The company will be merged into Clyde Blowers’ Swiss-based subsidiary Maag Pump Systems, acquired as part of the $1bn deal that saw the Scottish group acquire the fluid and power division of Textron in 2008.Jim McColl, chairman and chief shareholder in Clyde Blowers, said the Automatik deal would allow it to extend its offering to manufacturers from the pumping to “pelletising” of plastics into exact measures ahead of further processing into parts.The company, was previously acquired by Zurich-based private equity firm CGS Management from quoted Swiss company Rieter Group in 2008.The deal, which will see the sellers take up shares in expanded group, sees Clyde Blowers take on €35m of debt, valuing the equity of the target company at just short of £100m.The combined company,to be known at Maag Automatik, will employ 450 in ten countries, taking Clyde Blowers’ headcount to 5,700.Mr McColl, a former management consultant, signalled last month that he was looking to spend up to £1bn on acquisitions over the next three years as he announced a 37 per cent jump in profits at the group.Among the company’s other operations is ClydeUnion, the Glasgow-based company taken on three years ago when it was in danger of being closed by previous owners Weir Group.
50;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-05-17T12:32:08Z;Clyde Blowers eyes £1bn for buy-outs;;Clyde Blowers, one of the UK’s largest privately owned engineering groups, is looking to spend up to £1bn ($1.4bn) on acquisitions around the world in the next three years, on the back of a 37 per cent jump in profits in 2009, according to Jim McColl, its chairman and majority shareholder.Mr McColl, a 57-year-old former management consultant, is targeting divisions of large European or US engineering groups which he thinks could be given a new lease of life.Over the past two years he has positioned the company for growth, despite the global recession that has battered the profits of most engineering companies.“I told my top managers 18 months ago that I did not want to hear any of them talking about a downturn. My view was that in many of our businesses we had such a small market share we could make some big advances without any of our competitors really noticing,” Mr McColl says.He sees “abundant opportunities” for acquisitions ahead, particularly in fields connected with infrastructure development and renewable energy.Mr McColl has built up Clyde Blowers with the help of a novel approach in which he enlists venture capital companies to subscribe to a fund for acquisitions, giving them a stake in the ownership of new businesses, but without any management control.For instance, he set up a £225m fund with several financial groups that helped to finance the £620m acquisition of several businesses from Textron, the US conglomerate. Mr McColl says the same approach could swell the amount of money available to finance deals over the next few years.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the Clyde Blowers group came to £125m in 2009, up from £91m the year before. Group sales grew 11 per cent, from £1.21bn to £1.35bn.Clyde Blowers – of which Mr McColl owns 60 per cent – employs 5,500 people worldwide, of whom 1,500 are in the UK.About 30 per cent of group sales last year were in emerging markets. “There are some amazing prospects in countries such as China for western companies …So many of them have been so worried about a downturn that they have cut jobs and lowered their expectations, ignoring the opportunities for growth,” Mr McColl says.This year, Mr McColl believes that Clyde Blowers is on course to push up revenues to £1.6bn, while he is targeting growth in ebitda to £159m.He says that ClydeUnion, which makes large pumps worth up to $1m, is a good example of his company’s approach to growth.Clyde Blowers bought the Glasgow-based company three years ago when it was in danger of being closed by its previous owner, Weir Group, and set about expanding the workforce, mainly by taking on more sales engineers.“I introduced the philosophy that the more engineers we could employ to address opportunities by working up bids for projects around the world in fields such as nuclear energy or water treatment plants, the more business we were likely to win,” Mr McColl says.In the past 18 months, ClydeUnion has hired 200 of these engineers, taking its worldwide engineering staff to 500.“At the beginning of 2009 our engineers were bidding for £50m worth of work per month, but by the end they had the capacity to bid for £200m worth of work. Since on average about 10 per cent of the bids end up with firm orders, increasing the amount of engineering talent we brought to the company had a big impact in pushing up our ability to increase revenues,” he says.Translating the orders into sales was not a problem, Mr McColl says, because this part of Clyde Blowers can outsource manufacturing. Last year, sales at ClydeUnion increased 137 per cent, to £256m, while ebitda went up 98 per cent to £31.1m.
51;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-05-03T23:07:08Z;Jet prices: Market split overshadows optimism;;Order cancellations and hundred-million dollar revenue falls are never good news. But for Cessna and the business jet market, they are, perversely, a sign of slow improvement.In the first quarter of the year revenues at Cessna, the leading business jet maker, tumbled by almost 50 per cent to $433m and the order backlog fell 17 per cent to $4.1bn, as cancellations continued to come in.The company, owned by industrial group Textron, reported an operating loss of $24m for the three months to end-March. In the same period of 2009, it made an operating profit of $90m.Still, Scott Donnelly, the new chief executive of Textron, was cautiously optimistic, suggesting that the business jet market was heading towards a turn and that revenues, of which Cessna makes up about a third, had bottomed out.Shares in Textron, which also owns Bell Helicopter, jumped more than 12 per cent on the day of the results.“World economies generally appear to be recovering,” he said. “We believe the economic trend will translate to an eventual rebound in orders for business jets and commercial helicopters.”He said official data showed people were flying more in their business jets, that corporate profits were up and that Cessna was seeing more prospective buyers taking demonstration rides.According to UBS, 2,704 used business jets were available for sale at the end of March, or about 15 per cent of the total operating fleet, down 12 per cent from the peak in May 2009. In January, Cowen and Company noted that US business jet departures rose 10 per cent.“Clearly, the past 18 months have been difficult … but the increased level of sales activity towards the end of the quarter bodes well for this industry to start to turn,” Mr Donnelly said.Difficult is perhaps an understatement.In 2007, business jet makers seemed unstoppable, as deliveries surged to more than 1,000 for the first time and then rose again in 2008. Cessna and its peers, Gulfstream, owned by General Dynamics, Bombardier and others, planned for growth.By 2009, however, the bottom had fallen out of the market, as the global economic downturn and a wave of adverse public sentiment took their toll.Cash-strapped companies and individuals looked to sell assets and used business jets flooded the market. At the low point in May, almost 18 per cent of the entire fleet of business jets was up for sale and prices fell more than 50 per cent.With used jets in abundance, deliveries of new aircraft plunged. Last year, the business jet industry delivered 870 aircraft worth about $17.3bn, down 34 per cent on the previous year.To cope, Cessna cut its 16,000-strong workforce in half, slashed its production rates and began to move work to lower-cost locations. Hawker Beechcraft and other rivals also cut jobs.The recovery has been slow, says Brian Foley, an industry consultant. “The good news is that for a while we drove off a cliff and were bouncing off the rocks below. But now there seems to be some stability forming in the market.”The latest data from UBS, however, suggests that the outlook is fragile. In March, prices continued to fall in three out of six categories of used aircraft and a market survey showed sentiment had stalled after improving for eight months.Moreover, the market has begun to fracture – seemingly splitting in two as the recovery takes hold, says Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Company.Larger aircraft made by companies such as Gulfstream have recovered strongly. Used models are in short supply, thanks to interest from international customers who want long-range aircraft, rich individuals and private companies.At Gulfstream, orders for large-cabin aircraft improved steadily throughout 2009, and the company is predicting a low to mid single-digit increase in revenues in 2010 and a slight bump to profit margins.The market for mid-sized jets, however, remains weak and General Dynamics does not see any recovery in 2010. Inventories of secondhand short- and medium-range planes remain elevated at 17 and 15 per cent of the fleet, compared with a norm of about 12 per cent.“In Cessna’s markets there are still good used planes available and its competitors have also been dropping their prices.” Mr Rumohr says. “Also, more of their buyers are publicly owned US companies that have been under pressure.”Some analysts worry that any bounceback in the market as a whole will be muted.“Between 2006 and 2008, credit was very loose and half of all business jets were financed, many with deals including zero per cent down and low rates,” says Mr Foley. “That is all gone now. Lenders are asking for 20 to 30 per cent down now.”At the same time, companies such as NetJets that stimulated the market by selling fractions of aircraft are trying to repair their balance sheets and are not adding new jets, removing another key driver of demand.In his 10-year forecast, Mr Foley paints an attractive picture. Manufacturers will sell 8,900 business jets worth about $170bn, but annual sales will be limited.“It is going to be a modest rise – 2.5 per cent – a year and [in the 10 years] it will not quite reach where it was in 2008.”

53;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-04-29T21:44:17Z;20 questions: Jack Pelton, Cessna;Aviation enthusiast pilots corporate jet maker beyond recession;"Jack Pelton is chief executive of Cessna, the aircraft manufacturer that is a subsidiary of the Textron group, and is based in Wichita, Kansas.An aviation enthusiast, Mr Pelton has worked in the sector for three decades, and holds a commercial pilot’s licence, owns a single-engine plane and counts restoring antique aircraft among his pastimes.Cessna, like other corporate jet makers, was hit by the financial crisis and the public outcry in 2008 when the CEOs of the big three US carmakers flew in private jets to Washington to request taxpayer bail-out money.What are your three best features?
Approachability, sense of humour and passion for aviation.And your worst?
My looks, lack of patience and always trying to do 40 hours in 24.Strangest corporate jet specification?
You would never print the details if I told you. But it had to do with a very large person and a toilet.Best airport?
Long Beach, California, where I learnt to fly.Worst airport?
Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai, India.Has volcanic ash been an opportunity?
No, it has impacted us just as it has impacted everyone in the airline industry.What has the episode taught you?
That Mother Nature can hurt the economy.Most influential book?
The Bible.Guilty pleasure?
Quintessa, one of Napa Valley’s best.Do you ever travel economy?
I have travelled in economy in the past. Today, I like to think of economy as flying myself in my Cessna Turbo 206 single-engine piston airplane.Would you ever tell a CEO to fly economy?
Absolutely not. CEO effectiveness is all about productivity and business travel helps increase productivity.When do you turn off your BlackBerry?
Never. But I do keep it in another room when I sleep.What’s the worst job you’ve ever done?

Moving too slowly on making personnel changes when I have known the person is the wrong fit with the job.What is the smartest business idea you have ever had?
I like to think that it is not one single idea. But rather that each and every idea compounds the last so that over time the impact will be profound.Have you ever praised an employee and not meant it?
No, I could never do that as I am too transparent. As with most leaders, I probably err in not praising enough.What is your golden rule?
No surprises.What is your most hated business expression?
When people say, “We have an opportunity” in lieu of calling it what it really is: “We have a BIG problem.”Has your job made your personal life suffer? Fortunately not. I am blessed with an understanding wife who knows I love what I do and is supportive. Without her support, my personal life would be a wreck and I would not be as effective at work.How do you want to be remembered?
If you are being remembered, you are dead, so it really doesn’t matter."
54;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-04-12T20:54:08Z;Dow hits 11,000 ahead of earnings season;;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday closed above 11,000 for the first time since late September 2008, with the other main indices also recording modest gains.Investors mostly shrugged off the news about the Greek rescue package as they looked forward to the start of the new earnings season that aluminium producer Alcoa was set to kick off after the session closed.“The markets will be looking closely at the top and the bottom line [of the earnings results] to gauge how far along in this recovery we are,” said Brad Sorenson, director of market and sector analysis at Schwab Center for Financial Research.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent at 1,196.48 the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 0.1 per cent to 11,005.97 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent higher at 2,457.87.However, some analysts fear the markets could be set for a correction. “It would appear that just as individual investors have begun to show signs of warming up to equities, professional investors are showing greater nervousness as they consider where the markets are headed after arriving at 18-month and 19-month highs last week,” wrote John Stoltzfus, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities.Alcoa was 1.3 per cent higher at $14.57 ahead of its quarterly earnings.Electricity producer Mirant Corp strengthened 18.2 per cent to $12.68 as it announced a merger with RRI Energy in a $1.6bn stock transaction. The merger is aimed at cutting costs and taking advantage of rising power prices. RRI Energy was up 14.7 per cent to $4.53.Palm, a maker of smartphones, was up 17.1 per cent to $6.04 on reports that the company was looking to sell itself and was seeking bids as soon as this week.A-shares in Berkshire Hathaway, an insurance and investment conglomerate headed by Warren Buffett, lost 0.5 per cent to $120,465 while the B-shares were flat at $80.48 as Barclays Capital initiated coverage on the stock with an “equal weight” rating. Price targets for the A and B shares were $132,000 and $88, respectively.Analyst Jay Gelb said Mr Buffett “probably has enough time to set his
succession plan in motion to minimise disruption”.The Vix index fell 3.8 per cent to 15.52 to touch its lowest since June 2007.The airline sector was given a boost by comments from Giovanni Bisignani, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, the industry’s trade body.“Mergers and consolidation is a must,” he said. “No other industry is so fragmented, so we have to consolidate in order to build more efficiency.”Continental Airlines led the sector, rising 7 per cent to $23.03, UAL Corporation, the parent company of United Airlines, rose 4.7 per cent to $21.47 and US Airways advanced 4.1 per cent to $7.62.Following gains late last week after releasing strong March sales data, leading department stores fell yesterday. Macy’s lost 2.4 per cent to $22.94, Nordstrom declined 1.3 per cent to $42.01, and JC Penney fell 1.8 per cent to $30.96.Industrial conglomerates were some of the S&P 500’s biggest risers. General Electric climbed 1 per cent to $18.71 ahead of its quarterly results release this week, Leucadia gained 4.9 per cent to $26.84, and Textron climbed 2.3 per cent to $22.59.Shares in AIG rallied 8.1 per cent to $41.22 following reports that the company had unwound most of its troubled mortgage trades with Goldman Sachs.Financials strengthened across the board, ahead of what is expected to be a positive earnings season. “It is the leading sector performer so far this year. A lot of the good news is probably already priced in. There could be a bit of pullback when the results come out,” said Mr Sorenson.JPMorgan Chase was up 0.4 per cent to $46.14 and Bank of America rallied 0.4 per cent to $18.66 – both are set to release quarterly results this week – while Citigroup advanced 2 per cent to $4.64.Under Armor, a maker of work-out clothing, rose 2.1 per cent to $32.95 following an upgrade to “overweight” from “neutral” at Piper Jaffray."
55;TXT;Textron Inc;2010-03-16T18:31:15Z;Manufacturing: Mill towns are well suited to modern era;;When Harvey Nichols opened its first store outside London in Leeds 14 years ago, it created national headlines and at a stroke changed the northern city’s outdated image as a grimy, soot-covered mill town.The upmarket department store is about to raise eyebrows again this month as it showcases local textiles. The industry that once defined Leeds – when Montague Burton and J Hepworth and Son (now Next) were producing thousands of suits a day – has not gone away, just upmarket.Shoppers can touch cloth, woven in Keighley, that is used in the world’s most expensive suit – launched last year by Alexander Amosu and costing £70,000 ($106,000) – and the cashmere/mohair cloth, woven in Huddersfield, used for the dinner suit worn by Daniel Craig as James Bond.In all, 11 mills will take part in the exhibition, continuing a tradition that began with the fast-flowing streams and soft water that powered the woollen industry. Fashion houses such as Prada and Gucci still come to buy high quality cloth.Suzy Shepherd, a co-founder of Leeds Fashion Works, which is staging the exhibition, says: “Too many people really believe that the Yorkshire area, where the high-profile production of textiles had its birth, no longer has much to offer. The Harvey Nichols display …will dispel this myth once and for all.”Yet the area has always been about more than textiles, with Leeds once dubbed the city of a thousand trades.The region remains the second biggest manufacturing area in the UK, employing 162,000 people, or 8 per cent of the national workforce, according to 2008 figures. These jobs create more wealth than average, as most companies operate in high-margin fields. Manufacturing provides a balance to the large professional services sector.The biggest sectors are engineering, which employs 53,000, printing, with 26,600, food and drink, chemicals and healthcare. In Leeds alone, manufacturing accounts for 11 per cent of the city’s £15bn annual economic output.Productivity within manufacturing is higher than in many other sectors, with average output per worker at £46,500.Last year’s announcement that Carlsberg is closing its Tetley brewery, dating to 1822, has provoked outrage.Big employers remain, however, including Moores Furniture Group, Lever Fabergé, Schneider Electric, Sulzer (UK) Pumps, the Swiss supplier to the oil and gas industry, Arla Foods, the Danish dairy group, and Communisis, the printing company.Barnsley has Billington Holdings, the structural steel company that has just won a contract to refurbish the famous Café Royal in London, and some of the UK’s biggest bakeries.The bulk of foreign investment in the region in 2008 went into manufacturing, according to Ernst & Young, the professional services firm. The backbone of the region’s manufacturing however, is smaller, often family-owned businesses.Jo Haigh, a Huddersfield-based business consultant, says smaller companies have been hard hit by the recession and by banks failing to lend. “I have dealt with two administrations in the past few weeks in textiles. It is incredibly tough,” she says.Howard Pickard, managing director and the fifth generation of his family to run LBBC, an engineering company, has seen a lot of engineers around Stanningley, between Leeds and Bradford, pack up their tools because of competition.He says those that survive have a world beating product. LBBC’s is a valve that seals autoclaves. Because of its expertise, Resomation has just appointed it as its partner for a pioneering burial technique. The Scottish company has developed a water and alkali-based process that accelerates natural decomposition and offers a greener alternative to burial and cremation. The process has regulatory approval in the US and Canada.Down the road, Hainsworth, another old family company, is moving into eco-friendly woollen coffins.Microdat, which supplies the hard-hit brewing industry, is expanding despite the downturn. It is taking on six staff after winning two big orders, and has also received its first order from the US.The company’s 2010 order book, at £3m, has already exceeded of total business in 2009. Steve Midgley, founder and managing director, says: “It takes strong nerves to keep investing during a downturn, but our policy seems to have paid off.”Others are also heading abroad. Brandon Medical, the leading Leeds-based manufacturer of operating theatre equipment and medical audio & visual systems, is to start production in India under an agreement with Trivitron Healthcare, India’s biggest medical technology provider.The region seems to have woken up to the need to export, as UK growth is set to remain sluggish for some time to come. Royal Bank of Scotland figures show exports of goods from the region are growing faster than the national average.The value of exports by companies increased by £119m, or 4 per cent, between the second and third quarter of 2009. This compares to 1 per cent nationally.The average value of goods sold abroad per exporter in Yorkshire and The Humber increased by 9 per cent in the same period to about £807,000, still below the £1.13m national average.………………………………………Profile: DB Gear SystemsDavid Brown is a big name from the past that plans to carve out a big future for itself, too. The company is based in the engineering heartland of Huddersfield, 15 miles from Leeds.While once famous for its tractors and owning Aston Martin, its leading product has always been its gear systems, which are in every Royal Navy ship afloat as well as nuclear submarines, Challenger battle tanks and steel mills and coal mines worldwide.Now known as DB Gear Systems, the company is celebrating its 150th anniversary. Peter Bulkley, marketing director, says it is aiming to expand into new areas such as renewable energy after a recent change of ownership.“We see renewable and rail as significant growth opportunities,” he says. DB recently won a contract with Clipper, the US company, to design a gearbox for its new generation of offshore turbines to be built in the UK. Clipper was attracted by DB’s expertise in making durable and reliable gearboxes for large applications.The two prototypes, funded by the UK government, cost £1m each, stand 175m high and generate 10MW. “They will sit miles out to sea. They have to keep working, as you cannot just go and repair them,” says Ian Farquhar, UK general manager and head of renewables.He says that, if Clipper keeps to its plans, “the impact on our business would be significant. It would bring in £150m in sales and create 1,000 jobs.”As an example of DB’s capability, Mr Bulkley cites gears used in Australia for conveyors constantly moving iron ore on to trains for transfer to a port and shipping to China. “If the drive goes down, they could lose A$1m a day.“Reliability is critical because the cost of failure is huge. We have the equipment that can do it and the people who can support it. Our expertise is in precision and reliability at massive scale.”Unlike many local manufacturers, DB has not had to cut hours or staff in the recession. It has redeployed some people from making things to servicing them as it moves to a more flexible model.Clyde Blowers, a Scottish company, bought DB in 2008 from Textron of the US, the owner of Bell Helicopters and Cessna, which had moved out of renewables and channelled big investments elsewhere.It employs 1,140, with 450 at its head office and factory in Huddersfield. Turnover held steady in 2009 at £152m.Geoff Charlson, chief executive, says: “There has been a cultural shift. People understand the need for continual development as the company takes advantage of different opportunities in the marketplace. They know we are with them for the long haul.”Take the division in France, for example. Half its sales went to the automotive industry, hit heavily by the downturn, so it went out and won new contracts in servicing.The previous approach might have been to cut jobs. “2007 was the first year we had not reduced the workforce for many, many years,” says Mr Charlson.All senior executives have had leadership training while the company has set up a gearing academy with the University of Huddersfield that can award staff a post-graduate qualification, the MSc.It is not looking to outsource but makes products in the market where they are used. It has manufacturing bases in Australia, South Africa, Sweden, France, the US, Thailand and a new joint-venture in China. For example, South Africa makes gearboxes for mine machinery and crushers, with parts up to 14m in diameter.China will specialise in rail, as the country builds a high-speed network. Mr Bulkley says this could lead to repeat business.“It is not about the sale of the first piece of equipment but building a 20-year relationship,” he explains.

The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1.20 per cent to 2,116.09.However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.14 per cent to 9,882.17, helped by strong performance from blue-chips, such as International Business Machines and Exxon Mobil.Even some stronger than expected corporate results and a firm oil price, which pushed above $79 a barrel, could not lift many stocks.US Steel saw some of the heaviest losses, falling 7.8 per cent to $37.41, in spite of its better than expected results. The company posted a smaller than expected loss. Its shares were hit by worries over demand over the coming months, particularly for flat-rolled steel from US car makers following the end of Detroit’s “cash for clunkers” programme.Alcoa and Walt Disney lost more than 1 per cent after US consumer confidence numbers came in below estimates. Alcoa fell 3.54 per cent to $12.81 and Walt Disney was down 1.68 per cent to $28.17.Johnson Controls said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit surged, but its shares fell 4.76 per cent to $25.03, also on worries over demand. Valero Energy posted its third loss in four quarters, triggering a 4.34 per cent fall in its shares to $19.39.Stocks suffered as big demand for US Treasuries in a two-year auction raised doubts among some investors over the economy. Bidding for the $44bn on offer in two-year Treasuries was the highest in two years, according to analysts.The economic data was mixed, but most investors focused on the consumer confidence numbers, which unexpectedly fell in October for the second consecutive month. The Conference Board’s index fell to 47.7, weaker than the consensus expectation of a reading of 53.1. Confidence was hit by growing concerns that job market conditions would worsen in the near term, analysts said.However, Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller Composite index of home prices rose 1.2 per cent in August on the month, above expectations. That helped slow the annual pace of declines in the main 20-city index to 11.3 per cent.IBM shares rose 0.45 per cent to $19.39 after it approved an additional $5bn in stock repurchasesBP’s third-quarter results, beat third-quarter earnings forecasts, sent its shares up 4.22 per cent to $57.82. Shares in other oil majors, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, also rose, up 2.29 per cent to $74.91 and up 1.51 per cent to $76.59 respectively.Most analysts expect the US to escape recession with third quarter gross domestic product expected to rise more than 3 per cent, when the data are published tomorrow.Aircraft maker Textron was one of the best performing stocks as its shares rose 7.14 per cent to $19.67 after it posted unexpected profits.The company, which makes Cessna airplanes and Bell helicopters, made big savings from job cuts, helping to compensate for reduced production.Profit from continuing operations excluding some costs was 12 cents a share, beating the average Wall Street estimate.Analysts warned that equities could face continuing pressure over the next month as most of the good news from stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings over the past two weeks has now been priced into the market.The S&P 500 is up 3.7 per cent since October 1 and 57 per cent since its March 9 low this year.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: “It will be really hard for the market to go much higher from here. The market may well edge lower over next few weeks.“I don’t think we will get a true sense of where stocks or the economy is going until we get retail sales numbers following Thanksgiving at the end of November.”Peter Cardillo, chief market strategist at Avalon Partners, added: “Investors are going to be cautious. We might see some profit-taking from here until there are clearer signs of where the economy is going.”

Disappointing new home sales soon renewed investors’ concerns and Wall Street gave up its fleeting gains.“Typically, consumer sentiment would be a really good gauge on how likely they are to spend,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. “But this is why the unemployment figures next week will be so important. People can be as optimistic as they like and they may feel like things are getting better but that’s not going to bring about a great deal of spending right away.”The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent lower at 1,044.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 9,665.19 and the Nasdaq fell 0.8 per cent to 2,090.92. Since last week, the S&P lost 2.3 per cent, the Dow was down 1.6 per cent and the Nasdaq fell 2 per cent.After a shaky start to the week, Wall Street hit 11-month highs on Tuesday due to the weak dollar and rising commodity prices. As the US currency strengthened and oil sank below $70, commodity stocks pulled the market lower on Wednesday and Thursday. Poor data from the National Association of Realtors on existing home sales also hit sentiment and the Federal Reserve’s policy statement left the market nervous.This week has been the most active week for equity listings since December 2007 and analysts at JPMorgan said heavy issuance may have been weighing on equities.Textron, the industrial conglomerate, added to the woes of the sector on Friday. The shares fell 2.5 per cent to $17.88 after Cowen cut its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “outperform”. General Electric fell 1.3 per cent to $16.37.Caterpillar, after closing 2 per cent lower on Wednesday and Thursday due to falling commodity prices,fell 1.3 per cent to $51.20. The shares had been lifted in early trading after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “neutral”. Homebuilders were firmly in negative territory even before the release of the home sales data.KB Home, the Los Angeles homebuilder that targets first-time buyers, posted a narrower loss for its third quarter after cutting costs and focusing on selling smaller houses. Its chief executive said he did not expect to see any “meaningful improvement” in the US housing market in the near future. KB’s shares fell 8.5 per cent to $16.96.The pessimism spread to KB’s rivals and Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder, fell 1.2 per cent to $19.96 and Beazer Homes fell 5 per cent to $5.49.Research In Motion, which makes BlackBerry phones, added to the losses on the Nasdaq. The group posted quarterly results just above analysts’ estimates late on Thursday but gave a disappointing outlook. Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “buy,” saying it had doubts about the company’s ability to maintain market share in North America. The shares fell 17 per cent to $68.19.Allos Therapeutics erased early gains and was down 3.5 per cent at $7.87. The shares had spiked after it secured approval for a drug designed to treat lymphoma. Consumer groups performed well early on as investors looked for less risky stocks. Sara Lee lifted confidence after Unilever said it had agreed to pay $1.87bn for its personal care brands. The shares gained 6.4 per cent to $11.21.

Analysts had expected 250,000 job losses.Disappointing news on factory orders also offset better-than-expected data on non-farm productivity.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 994.75. On Tuesday, the index fell below 1,000 for the first time since the middle of August. The Nasdaq fell 0.1 per cent to 1,967.07, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3 per cent to 9,280.67.“Even though the ADP numbers were a little bit disappointing, it is still consistent with improving data so I think what we’re going to see . . . is the market trying to stabilise over the next day or so before we move into the long weekend,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.Energy companies were some of the market’s best performers following BP’s announcement that it had made a significant oil discovery at its Tiber Prospect in the US waters of the Gulf of Mexico.ConocoPhillips, one of BP’s partners in the Tiber, closed up 0.4 per cent at $44.34. The materials sector also fed the market’s gains after the price of gold climbed to a three-month high during the day.As the mood of uncertainty persisted, investors headed towards the consumer staples sector later in the day. Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort, was one of the main beneficiaries, rising 5.9 per cent to $46.39. Coca-Cola climbed 2.3 per cent to $49.8.After leading Tuesday’s decline, the S&P financials group flirted with gains for brief periods before closing down 1 per cent.Wells Fargo rose 0.5 per cent to $26.09, after Bloom-berg reported the bank planned to pay back bail-out money to the US government without issuing new shares.The San Francisco-based lender had been at the centre of a sell-off in the financial sector on Tuesday as fears grew about the health of the banking system.But concern still lingered. Citigroup closed up 0.4 per cent at $4.56 and Bank of America was up 1.1 per cent at $16.27.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac suffered after the Mortgage Bankers Association proposed that Congress transform the government-controlled mortgage lenders into several smaller privately-held companies backed by government guarantees.Fannie Mae was down 13.8 per cent at $1.37, while Freddie Mac retreated 13.7 per cent to $1.64.The industrial sector also showed losses as investors digested the stream of mixed economic data.General Electric was down 1.1 per cent at $13.20, while US Steel Corporation was down 0.6 per cent at $41.71.Textron, which owns a network of aircraft, defence, industrial and finance businesses, escaped the sector’s decline and closed 12.2 per cent up at $17.39 after an upgrade from Goldman Sachs.However, homebuilders maintained losses even as the broader market wavered.Hovnanian fell 7.4 per cent at $4.65, while Standard Pacific was down 1.2 per cent at $3.26. The stocks had enjoyed a rally a week previously when US home sales data for July came in above forecast.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Walgreen fell 0.7 per cent to $33.81 after the drugstore chain announced that comparable front-end sales had fallen 1.3 per cent in August as shoppers cut back on discretionary items.After a rally on Tuesday on news of trials of seasonal flu vaccines, Novavax fell 10.7 per cent to $5.94 on a downgrade.The utilities sector remained in the red for most of the day.
59;TXT;Textron Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

and Colgate-Palmolive will report their second-quarter results.After falling as much as 1.3 per cent, the S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 979.62. Equity volatility on the S&P rose, with the CBOE Vix index settling just under 25.Of the 10 major S&P industry sectors, technology was a rare standout, while utilities and energy dropped around 1.5 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite turned positive at mid-afternoon and closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,975.51 as tech continued to exert its leadership over the market.The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared early losses and settled 0.1 per cent lower at 9,096.72, as energy stocks weighed on blue chips.Ahead of earnings this week, Chevron slipped by 0.7 per cent to $68.34, while Exxon Mobil was down1.2 per cent at $71.89. The Dow was also hurt by American Express, which was lower by 2.5 per cent at $27.68 in the wake of a brokerage downgrade.In deal news, IBM, another member of the Dow, said it will buy SPSS, a provider of predictive analytics software, based in Chicago, for $50 a share, or $1.2bn.Shares in SPSS surged 41 per cent to $49.45, while IBM was lower by 0.3 per cent at $117.28.One bright spot for blue chips was General Electric, up 1.6 per cent at $12.52 as the conglomerate said its finance unit needs further capital.Further signs of a potential bottom in house prices helped homebuilders, with the S&P index up 0.1 per cent.In May, the S&P/Case-Shiller home price index posted its first month-over-month gain since its peak in July 2006.“A reversal in the direction of home prices, if sustained, will do a lot to help stabilise the banking system and re-liquefy the economy,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. “The broadening out in home price grains is perhaps the most important aspect of the report.”However, the Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence dropped more than forecast in July to 46.6, amid concerns over employment prospects.“The US consumer remains the weakest link in the very modest US upswing,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Securities.While the rally from the lows set in March remains intact, with the S&P 500 closing at a fresh eight- month high on Monday, some investors caution that the lowering of the bar for the second-quarter earnings season is an easy hurdle for companies to overcome.“Much of the improvement in profitability appears to be the result of expense-cutting via workforce reductions and inventory management, as opposed to top-line revenue growth,” said Wasif Latif, vice-president of equity investments at USAA Investment Management Company.“More than two-thirds of companies have reported sales declines,” he said. “To increase earnings on a sustainable basis, sales need to pick up.”Among earnings reports, Viacom recorded a drop of 32 per cent in second-quarter profits, as revenue fell 14 per cent to $3.3bn and missed a forecast of $3.5bn. The media conglomerate’s shares closed down 1.8 per cent at $25.15.Meanwhile, Office Depot was trading down 18 per cent at $4.38, after it reported a wider-than-forecast loss of $82m for the second quarter, and sales fell 22 per cent.Valero Energy reported a second-quarter loss, but it beat analysts’ estimates. The independent oil refiner saw its revenue tumble by 51 per cent for the quarter, which was not as bad as feared. That sparked a drop of 2.4 per cent to $18.32 in its shares.Shares in Textron jumped 18 per cent to $13.11. The maker of corporate jets recorded a second-quarter loss and cut its 2009 sales forecast, but beat estimates."

He was accused of allegedly profiting from a hoax takeover offer for Harman International, the S&P 500 audio systems group.Mr Braikan was found at his house with a gunshot to the head according to an interior ministry official.The SEC had obtained an emergency court order freezing more than $5m in trading profits in various US accounts in Mr Braikan’s name, and related entities. The other defendants include Kipco Asset Management Company (Kamco) and United Gulf Bank, both of which are affiliated to Kuwait’s ruling family.The SEC claimed that Mr Braikan and the other related entities amassed large positions in Harman shortly before the false rumours surfaced and then sold them as prices soared.It also alleged that two of the entities were involved in a similar transaction related to a second US company – Textron – in April.Kamco said that the transactions were undertaken “under specific instructions of its client in normal course of business. Kamco has or had no proprietary investment or any interest in the related shares.”United Gulf Bank said it “only provided custody and transaction execution services for those trades in its normal course of business”.Both further said that they made no gain from trading in the shares of Harman and Textron, while Al Raya – which is part owned by Citigroup – said it committed no violations.The saga is embarrassing for Kuwait, which is grappling with internal problems in its financial sector after two leading Kuwaiti investment houses defaulted and a commercial bank had to be bailed out by the government.The rumours about the bogus takeover of Harman surfaced last Sunday following a Kuwaiti newspaper report that a Saudi Arabia-based company – Arabian Peninsula Group (APG) – intended to take over the US company. Faxes, with Kuwaiti codes, were sent to newsrooms, but no record of APG could be found.Harman’s share price climbed more than 40 per cent in pre-market trading on the following Monday. The US company denied that it had received any bid from the mystery suitor.The other defendants – Kamco and United Gulf Bank – are subsidiaries of Kuwait Projects Company (Kipco), one of Kuwait’s best-known companies, and chaired by a son of the emir.

As the industry is forced to retrench rapidly and painfully, it is also having to fight a desperate rearguard action to save its reputation.The image of business aviation has been dangerously undermined, as the use of private jets has become one of the most potent symbols of corporate excess during the era of imploding financial markets, bank rescues and deepening recession.The fateful decision by leaders of the US automakers to fly by private jet to Washington last November to plead their case for government financial help has come to epitomise the unacceptable behaviour of parts of the world’s corporate elite.US congressmen were quick to ridicule the chief executives. For advocates of the use of private jets as highly efficient business tools, it was a very damaging own goal that has undermined the corporate aerospace sector at a moment of dangerous vulnerability.”There’s a delicious irony of seeing private luxury jets flying into DC and people coming off them with tin cups in their hands, saying that they’re going to be trimming down and streamlining their businesses,” Gary Ackerman, a Democrat from New York, told a House of Representatives hearing.”It’s almost like seeing a guy show up at the soup kitchen in high hat and tuxedo …Couldn’t you all have downgraded to first class or jet-pooled to get here?” he asked the auto industry chiefs.The business jet makers are trying hard to combat the storm of political protest at the perceived fat cat travel habits of some leading corporate executives. But they are being forced to take up the public relations battle just as they need to focus all their attention on reshaping their own businesses.“This is an extremely difficult time for our industry,” Pete Bunce, president and chief executive of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (Gama) said last week.“We are dealing first and foremost with the severe negative effects of a worldwide economic downturn, but also with unwarranted criticism focused on the industry.” The result had been the cancellation of orders and the loss of more than 15,000 high-paying jobs in the US alone in recent months.“The reality is that the US general aviation industry leads the world in innovation and remains one of the few American industries with a positive balance of trade,” said Mr Bunce. “We will continue to work with governments around the world to recognise that general aviation can play a key role in propelling the economic recovery.”For the moment, however, the industry appears to be in freefall. Jet makers have been stunned by the speed of the decline, as orders are deferred or cancelled, leading to plunging deliveries, wholesale job cuts, suspended development programmes and corporate failures among some of the smaller producers.Last year global business jet deliveries were still rising thanks to several years of surging orders that had built up record order backlogs. Deliveries increased again last year by 16 per cent from 1,138 in 2007 to a fresh peak of 1,315, up from only 518 at the bottom of the last economic cycle in 2003, according to Gama.But as the turmoil in financial markets intensified, cutting off sources of funds to buyers of new jets, and as the recession spread around the globe during the second half of last year, the impact was quickly felt in business aviation The tide has turned with shocking speed. Last week Gama said business jet deliveries in the first quarter had already fallen by 36 per cent to 191 from 297 a year ago.The shrinking of orders and deliveries has happened much more rapidly in the business jet sector than in the rest of the commercial aerospace industry.Some corporate jet makers have already announced several rounds of jobs cuts in only a few months, led by Cessna, the world’s biggest maker of light and mid-sized business jets and a subsidiary of the struggling Textron group.Cessna first signalled in November that it was planning to pare back its planned production increase in 2009, but what started as a modest reduction of its ambitions has developed into a rout.Two weeks ago it added yet another round of redundancies with the result that as many as 6,900 jobs will be eliminated from a workforce that stood at around 16,000 late last year, a reduction in the workforce of as much as 43 per cent.Deliveries of Cessna’s family of Citation business jets reached a record 467 last year and it had originally been planning to raise output further to 535 in 2009. Instead, in a series of deep cuts, deliveries are being reduced to only 290-300 this year. The labour content is dropping even more sharply, as a growing share of production, as much as 40 per cent, is accounted for by the new range of Citation Mustang very light jets, which require less work than the bigger jets.Textron announced two weeks ago that Cessna had suffered 92 net order cancellations in the first quarter alone. Its business jet deliveries in the three months dropped by 27 per cent to 69 from 95 a year ago.The recession has become so severe that Cessna was forced two weeks ago to suspend the expensive development of its new range of larger business jets, the Citation Columbus, launched in February last year.The Columbus was planned to be Cessna’s first intercontinental executive jet, taking it into direct competition in the market for large business jets with France’s Dassault, Canada’s Bombardier and Gulfstream of the US.Development costs for the new range were expected to total around $780m with Cessna aiming for first flight in 2011 and the start of deliveries in 2014.Textron is being forced to return about $50m in deposits taken for initial Columbus orders, and the impact of the suspension will be felt across the supply chain, where groups such as Pratt & Whitney Canada, Spirit AeroSystems, Rockwell Collins, Vought and Goodrich had been chosen as leading suppliers to the programme.Scott Donnelly, Textron chief operating officer, told investors two weeks ago: “These are pretty extraordinary times. We have cases every day where a customer comes out, they’ve made all their deposits, they’ve come out, they’ve done the paint, everything they want on the aircraft and they’ve had to lay off 20 per cent of their workforce. And they come back to us and say, ‘Look we can’t fly our new airplane into our town after we’ve just laid off a bunch of employees’.”All the leading business jet makers are being forced to shrink their operations, while more serious casualties have included Eclipse Aviation, the US pioneer maker of very light, four-passenger corporate jets.Hawker Beechcraft of the US said in February it would remove 2,300 jobs on top of an initial 500 it eliminated late last year, a combined reduction of close to 30 per cent of the workforce of around 10,000.Gulfstream of the US has cut about 1,200 jobs, while Canada’s Bombardier, one of the world’s big four aircraft makers, said last month it was cutting another 3,000 jobs or around 10 per cent of its aerospace workforce in response to the deepening recession in both commercial and private aviation.The latest reduction came only two months after Bombardier announced it was cutting 1,360 jobs bringing the total to 4,360 or close to 15 per cent of the group’s global aerospace workforce since early February.According to Bombardier, business aircraft demand “deteriorated rapidly” during the second half of last year and is expected to remain weak “for the foreseeable future.” It has forecast a drop in business jet deliveries of around 25 per cent this year.Mark Van Tine, chairman of Gama, says the industry is “facing some of the most severe turbulence that we have seen in decades”. Markets outside the US are no longer able to make up for the steep fall in demand in North America.Current flying activity remains depressed. According to the latest study from UBS, take-offs and landings by business jets declined by 30 per cent year-on-year in March. The market is “characterised by significant oversupply, plummeting pricing and tight financing,” says the UBS report.And, crucially, it says its key indicators and contacts are “not yet signalling a bottom”.
63;TXT;Textron Inc;2009-04-09T21:34:03Z;Textron soars on acquisition hopes;;Shares of Textron soared by 49 per cent amid speculation the industrial conglomerate could be broken up and sold to a consortium of Middle East and US investors.Al-Watan, a Kuwaiti newspaper, reported on Thursday that a United Arab Emirates group was close to a deal to acquire Textron, whose businesses range from Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters to E-Z-Go golf carts, for $21 a share, or more than $5bn. The buyers would then find a US company to take over Textron’s defence division, the paper said, citing unnamed sources.The report captured the imagination of many investors who had pining for this very scenario since the credit crisis began to take its toll on Textron’s finance unit, which has originated loans for everything from Bell aircraft to vacation homes.A company spokeswoman declined to comment on “market rumours.”Textron rejected the NYSE’s request to issue a public statement ”indicating whether there are any corporate developments which may explain the unusual activity,” adding more weight to speculation that deal talks are underway - even if the would-be buyers are far from the Middle East.“Textron is probably having exploratory discussions with a lot of parties,” one banker said.Textron shares surged $4.45 to $13.56 on the New York Stock Exchange.Facing mounting losses, Textron unveiled a plan in December to sell or liquidate most of the finance businesses unrelated to its own products, or roughly $7.9bn the division’s $11.4bn portfolio of managed receivables.The company has also said they would not rule out selling some of its core businesses to help weather both a credit crisis, which has punished its finance arm, and a deepening recession that has sapped demand for its aircraft and industrial gear.“While it’s hard to call, a takeout here would not be shocking, given the liquidity needs and management credibility issues at present,” Stephen Tusa, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a note to clients.Mr Tusa also said the $21-per-share price “looks expensive,” noting he valued the industrial businesses at $12 a share. The finance division, he wrote, “could be worth negative $1.5-2bn.”Industrial bankers have long held the view that there is no single buyer for Textron because of its incongruous mix of aerospace and defence assets, the struggling financial division and an industrial business that builds products including golf carts and tools.”It’s not really a sensible strategic collection,” said one dealmaker.Nevertheless some bankers wondered why Textron would want to hand itself to a consortium, rather than to retain control of its own destiny. While Textron is struggling against slowing demand for many of its products and posted a loss in the fourth quarter, it recently sold assets to raise $365m and has drawn down $3bn in credit lines to boost liquidity.The also noted that any bid from a non-US entity could draw scrutiny from Washington, especially if a domestic partner does not step with a simultaneous bid to acquire Textron’s defence operations.Rather than selling the whole company, bankers said Textron might be better-served to sell its industrial or defence units - or even just one key asset that could extract a decent price, such as Bell - allowing the rest of the company to survive as a better-capitalised entity.Bell could attract broad interest from companies including Boeing, United Technologies’ Sikorsky, or Lockheed Martin, industry experts said.Textron has been viewed as a potential private equity target for the past decade because of its disparate assets, but it would have difficulty drawing buy-out bids in this credit-strained climate.Smaller pieces of the company could still draw interest, however, including the industrial unit that includes its golf-cart manufacturing operation, whose links to Augusta National Golf Club, host of the Masters tournament, could serve as icing on the cake for some private buyers. Its main rival, Club Car, was once owned by private equity.

This triggered a 22.7 per cent fall in Sun’s shares to $6.56.Banking stocks also suffered after Mike Mayo, an analyst at Calyon Securities, began coverage on 11 leading banks, giving them all an “underperform” or “sell” rating. Mr Mayo, one of the earliest analysts to turn bearish on banks, warned loan losses might exceed those seen during the great depression.Billionaire investor George Soros added his doubts about banks’ health later in the day, saying: “The banking system as a whole is basically insolvent.”Wells Fargo fell 6.7 per cent to $15.25, while Citigrouplost 4.6 per cent to $2.72 and JPMorgan dropped 3.7 per cent to $28.20.Investors are relying on banks to pull markets out of their slump more than any time in the past 60 years, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg, and worries over their profitability weighed heavily on the markets as a whole.After a very late rally, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.8 per cent down at 835.48 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 7,975.85 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.9 per cent to 1,606.71 points.“This was a dramatic run up and as we approach earnings season investors are being cautious and taking profits off the table at any opportunity,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford,But George Feiger, chief executive of Contango Capital Advisers warned the slide is a sign of more fundamental problems. “The big problems with the economy are still there,” he said. “We are still only at the beginning of this problem.”Commodities companies also declined on the back of falling materials prices. Steel makers suffered particularly badly after Deutsche Bank warned demand for steel in North America could fall 25 per cent this year. US Steel fell 2.7 per cent to $25.16 and AK Steel dropped 4.7 per cent to $8.82.The defence sector received a late shot in the arm as Robert Gates,
the defence secretary, announced an overhaul of government spending. Lockheed Martin gained 8.9 per cent to $73.28 after Mr Gates said the government would double the budget for Lockheed’s F-35 fighter plane.Northrop Grumman also stood to benefit from increased spending, and its shares lifted 9 per cent to $47.94.Lockheed was also involved in another of the day’s big stories, as speculation mounted that it might look at acquiring Textron, the maker of Cessna aircraft. Textron’s share rose 11.3 to a two-month high of $8.26.Cisco added to the pressure already weighing on the technology sector because of the withdrawal of IBM’s offer for Sun. Cisco was downgraded by Goldman Sachs from “conviction buy” right back to “neutral”, with the bank saying recent gains in the company’s stock meant future growth was now priced in. The technology company fell 3.5 per cent to $17.53.Credit Suisse meanwhile said: “We believe Cisco has seen further incremental weakness in its enterprise business, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of total revenues.”General Motors was one of the session’s few risers, lifting 8.1 per cent to $2.27 after Fritz Henderson, its new chief executive, said bankruptcy was not inevitable for the company.Ford also gained ground after it was able to reduce its debt by $9.9bn after swapping much of it for cash and equity. Shares in the carmaker advanced 16 per cent to $3.77.Bristol-Myers Squibb, the pharmaceutical company, performed well after it renegotiated a licensing agreement with Japan’s Otsuka Pharmaceutical to sell the Abilify schizophrenia drug for an extra 29 months. It s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $20.51. The healthcare sector was also bolstered by insurers, which rebounded after falling on Wachovia’s prediction that government proposals to cut their subsidies could cost them as much as 20 per cent of their earnings.Humana gained 3.3 per cent to $26.31 and UnitedHealth picked up 6.8 per cent to $21.93."
65;TXT;Textron Inc;2009-03-24T23:38:36Z;UTC eyes potential M&A targets;;If any United Technologies investors were still wondering if the deepening recession would damp the conglomerate’s enthusiasm for acquisitions, UTC’s five-and-a-half-hour presentation earlier this month left little doubt where its executives stood.“We’re a willing buyer,” said Louis Chênevert, UTC’s chief executive, whose words were echoed repeatedly by a number of his lieutenants throughout the meeting.The conglomerate, which owns businesses that include Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, is on the lookout for deals. UTC has set aside $2bn as a “place holder” budget that could be exceeded if the right opportunity emerged among the dozens of potential targets it has in its sights.Mr Chênevert also made it clear he would be willing to use the company’s stock to help pay for larger acquisitions – piquing the interest of industry executives, analysts and advisers who have been waiting for the company to pursue an aerospace rival such as Rockwell Collins or Goodrich.Nicole Parent, an analyst with Credit Suisse, said UTC would probably be willing to stretch its M&A budget to $8bn.“There are nice businesses out there that fit terrifically,” Ms Parent said. “But they aren’t for sale.”UTC needs willing sellers, though, and may find them as they turn to deals that would bolster some of their other businesses.Almost half of the $15bn UTC has spent on acquisitions since 2000 went to build out its fire and security unit, and the company wants to expand the division in the US. One possibility is Monitronics International, an alarm-monitoring company controlled by ABRY Partners. ABRY, a private-equity firm, has put the business up for sale, people familiar with its plans said.Textron has not ruled out selling some core businesses, including the conglomerate’s Bell helicopter unit, to help weather a credit crisis that has punished its finance arm. Jeffrey Pino, who runs Sikorsky, called such a deal “an interesting hypothesis” earlier this month.The downturn has pulled many share prices to lows unseen in years. And much like the homeowner convinced his or her property is undervalued, chief executives are reluctant to sell divisions or entire companies at such depressed levels.But Jim Geisler, UTC’s vice-president of corporate strategy and planning, says things are changing. “It’s in the process of changing. Most CEOs can tell you their 52-week high. That process takes a little bit of time.”Nick Heymann, an analyst with Sterne Agee, predicted the deals would not come until later this year.“You will see a lot of M&A once you see what the new normal is,” said Frank Aquila, a partner with Sullivan & Cromwell. “The disjuncture of buyer expectations will lead to more unsoliciteds than we have seen for a long time.”While Mr Chênevert ruled out going “hostile” – as UTC did last year when the company sought to acquire Diebold, the maker of automated teller machines, after its efforts to negotiate with management failed – people familiar with the matter have argued UTC would consider going public with unsolicited offers.
66;TXT;Textron Inc;2009-03-15T09:25:21Z;Pension fund treads a thorny path;;"Norway likes to think of itself as an ethical model for others. It spends 1 per cent of its gross national income on international development assistance and $1bn (£723m, €783m) to save the rainforest in Brazil.But the paradoxes within one of its most visible efforts, the ethical investment strategy of its government pension fund, show how difficult it is to bridge the irreconcilable differences between the two main purposes of the world’s second largest sovereign wealth fund: to make money while investing ethically. The most recent contradiction, and probably most ironic, is the finance ministry’s current consideration of whether to exclude companies for carbon emission violations.Norway’s NKr2,275bn (£239bn, €258bn, $329bn) Government Pension Fund - Global, originally known as the Petroleum Fund, is funded by revenues from fossil fuels and even invests in oil companies. The government was obliged to take up the matter after Norwegian environmentalist group Bellona last year made a formal recommendation to the ministry as part of a white paper on the fund’s management to be submitted to parliament on March 27.The paper is the culmination of the most exhaustive review of the fund’s ethical guidelines since their introduction five years ago. It will provide the eventual basis for any potential changes to the guidelines this summer.“Climate change was central [to the public consultation process],” says Martin Skancke, finance ministry director general for asset management. “But the advice was broad, including positive screening, active ownership and separate allocations towards green technology companies.”Several companies have also made recommendations in the current consultation for the fund to abstain from tobacco company investments. The fund can presently exclude tobacco companies on an ad hoc basis if their marketing poses a serious violation of ethical norms. So far, none have been excluded and in fact the fund has ownership in some of the major tobacco companies, such as Altria and Philip Morris, according to its year-end report.The list of contradictions does not end there. The fund has excluded Lockheed Martin from its investment portfolio, yet the country buys its planes. The fund also temporarily blacklisted US oil company Kerr McGee for pollution violations at a Western Sahara project, despite a Norwegian company being involved in the project.Moreover, Norway has a formal ethics council for the Government Pension Fund - Global, but cannot present conclusive evidence that ethical investing pays off financially.“It’s not difficult to find the paradoxes in this,” says Gro Nystuen, chair of the ethics council. “But if you try and do everything 100 per cent, it is paralysing.”Ms Nystuen is one of five council members, part of whose job it is to recommend which companies to exclude. She says the ethical part of the government pension fund’s investment strategy dates back to the late 1990s when journalists unearthed an embarrassing revelation about the fund’s investment in a Singapore company involved in anti-personnel land mines shortly after Norway hosted the international Land Mine Ban conference in Oslo. The situation prompted the eventual formation of the independent advisory council on ethics in 2004.The blacklist of excluded companies comprises polluting miners, weapons producers and companies with labour violations. The council gets its leads from the Ethical Investment Research Service, a UK screening company that looks at the 7,000 companies in the fund’s portfolio and mines for keywords. Eiris sends the council the names of 40 to 60 possible offenders every month. The council also gets tips from non-government organisations and journalists.The fund recently excluded investments in Canadian mining company Barrack Gold for environmental damages and US company Textron for cluster weapons production. There are currently 29 companies excluded from the fund’s investment portfolio.The council’s work has been conducive to changing the way some companies behave.Monsanto is a key example. The council initially recommended in 2006 that the finance ministry exclude the US agricultural company because of its use of child labour in its cotton seed production in India. But after working together with the company, and even going so far as to physically go into the fields and count children, the ministry decided last year to keep Monsanto because it had made significant improvements.The fund’s ethical investment strategy has also been influential in changing the way other pension funds invest. The Swedish AP Fund was persuaded to disinvest in Wal-Mart following Norway’s lead; Norwegian pension fund KLP has followed the government pension fund’s recommendations, and the fund has influenced the New Zealand Superannuation Fund."
67;TXT;Textron Inc;2009-02-08T19:28:47Z;Business aircraft makers face severe test;;Business jet makers reeling from the US political attack on some of their highest profile corporate high fliers are being forced to make increasingly drastic cuts in production and jobs in the face of the deepening global recession.Jim Schuster, chief executive of Hawker Beechcraft, one of the leading US corporate jet suppliers, said: “We are undoubtedly facing one of the most severe tests in our company’s history.”The group said last week it would remove 2,300 jobs on top of an initial 500 it eliminated late last year, a combined reduction of close to 30 per cent of the workforce of about 10,000.Big production and job cuts have also been announced by Cessna, part of the US Textron group, and by Canada’s Bombardier.The downturn and the credit crunch are biting deeper and more quickly into the operations of the business jet makers than the suppliers of commercial jets, although Boeing has also announced recently it is cutting 4,500 or close to seven per cent of the jobs from its commercial aircraft division.Mr Schuster said Hawker Beechcraft was being forced to reduce production and workforce levels further “due to the increasing severity of the global economic decline”.He said the US government’s stimulus package had failed sufficiently to loosen credit markets, which were “absolutely vital” to the success of the business aviation sector.At the same time, orders from previously high-volume business segments, in particular fractional jet ownership groups such as NetJets, part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group, had slowed considerably.Mr Schuster condemned the political attacks in the US that had “cast general aviation as a wasteful extravagance instead of a critical business tool and the source of millions of American jobs.”Corporate use of business jets has come under increasing fire in the US since the leaders of US carmakers flew to Washington by private jet to plead for government financial help.Intervention by Treasury officials forced Citigroup to scrap the purchase of a Gulfstream jet.Jack Pelton, chief executive of Cessna, the world’s biggest maker of light and mid-sized corporate jets, said since the third quarter last year jet orders had dropped significantly and cancellations and deferrals of orders were seriously affecting 2009 production growth.The number of hours being flown by the existing business jet fleet had slowed, inventories of used aircraft were growing, the US domestic market remained very soft, and “the international markets that were very strong a year ago are now quiet,” said Mr Pelton.Cessna had also been hit by a deferral of a significant number of planes by NetJets that were scheduled for delivery in 2009.It is eliminating another 2,000 jobs, bringing the total cuts to 4,600 in three months, and is planning to reduce jet production by 20 per cent to 375 in 2009 from a record 467 last year.Mr Pelton said: “The challenges we face are unprecedented in recent memory”.Customers and potential customers continued to feel the impact of declining corporate profits and tight credit markets.Bombardier, the world’s leading business jet maker by value of deliveries, said last week its business jet orders had fallen by 42 per cent from 452 to 262 in the 12 months to the end of January.The group had been hit by a “greater than usual” level of order deferrals and cancellations and was cutting deliveries in 2009 by about 10 per cent from 239 in 2008.Bombardier is removing about 1,360 jobs or 4.5 per cent of its 30,000 strong workforce, comprising 1,010 temporary jobs and subcontractors and 350 permanent employees - at its plants in Montreal, Wichita, Kansas and Belfast in Northern Ireland.Guy Hachey, Bombardier Aerospace president said: “The industry is experiencing strong turbulence and we anticipate more volatility in the short term”.

Boeing, the world’s second-largest aircraft manufacturer, also announced 10,000 job losses and cut its revenue forecast for this year.A string of smaller US manufacturers such as Illinois Tool Works, a diversified manufacturer, Kennametal, an industrial toolmaker, and Timken, a bearings and speciality steelmaker, also issued poor quarterly earnings results and profit warnings. Oshkosh, the Wisconsin-based truck maker, withdrew its 2009 profit forecast completely.George Buckley, 3M chief executive, said the economic climate in the fourth quarter of last year “was different from any pattern we’ve ever seen before”. 3M’s profit in the fourth quarter was $536m or 77 cents a share, down from $851m or $1.17 per share in the same period a year earlier.Lewis Campbell, Textron’s chief executive, said 2009 was “setting up to be the most challenging year ever for most manufacturing companies”.Textron is braced for a sharp decline in demand for corporate jets, which have become a symbol of executive profligacy. Citigroup cancelled a jet order this week after widespread criticism, while Starbucks said it would sell two of its three jets.

Most analysts expect that the more than year-long recession will get worse before it gets better and investors are bracing themselves for more pain in 2009.Bright spots have been few and far between. Even the usually steady consumer staples sector is down by almost a fifth this year.The financial sector in particular has been decimated, with the S&P Financials index down almost 60 per cent so far this year.The embattled automotive sector was in sharp focus early this week as it suffered steep losses on the back of a bleak forecast from Toyota and the expression of continuing doubts about the sector by analysts.Toyota’s American Depositary Receipts were down 1.1 per cent for the week at $63.65. Ford shares were down 22.4 per cent at $2.29.The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, has shown signs in recent days of trending broadly downwards and ended the week down 3.2 per cent at 43.36.While volumes remained low throughout the holiday shortened week, several pieces of generally disappointing economic data were issued, giving investors some direction.The US Department of Commerce said the US economy shrank at a 0.5 per cent annual pace in the third quarter after consumers and businesses cut spending
and the recession gathered steam. The department reported that new-home sales fell for the fourth month in a row in November and the pace of existing home sales plunged by a record 8.6 per cent in that month, while the median home price dropped for a fifth straight month to $181,300, according to the National Association of

Toyota’s American depositary receipts were down 0.8 per cent at $60.33.Ford was the third most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange and its shares were down 15.4 per cent at $2.19, making it the fourth-biggest faller on the S&P.Stock market investors have been left reeling through the market turmoil of recent months and the S&P 500 is down more than 40 per cent this year, on course for its worst year since the Great Depression.David Buik, of BGC Partners, said among the reasons for the stock market’s rollercoaster ride was the “irrational decision” by the US Treasury to allow Lehman Brothers to fall by the wayside when, before that decision, AIG, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae had been accommodated.“There is nothing more toxic than fear and uncertainty to galvanise equity operators to dump their books unceremoniously,” he said.“That’s exactly what happened in extreme degrees of volatility that had never before been experienced in the living memory of mature markets.”By the close in New York, the S&P 500 index was down 1 per cent at 863.16 while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.7 per cent at 1,521.54.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.2 per cent as well, at 8,419.49.While volumes remained low in the holiday shortened week, several pieces of economic data were issued, giving investors some direction.Wednesday’s session will end early and the markets will remain closed on Thursday for Christmas Day.The US Department of Commerce said the US economy shrank at a 0.5 per cent annual pace in the third quarter after consumers and businesses cut spending and the recession gathered steam. The decline in GDP in the third quarter against the previous three months was the steepest since the third quarter of 2001.Separately, the Commerce Department reported that new-home sales fell for the fourth month in a row in November and prices remained below levels of a year ago.The pace of existing home sales plunged by a record 8.6 per cent in November while the median home price dropped for a fifth straight month to $181,300, according to the National Association of Realtors.The banking sector was in focus, with shareholders on Tuesday expected to vote in favour of two bank deals forged at the height of the financial crisis this year.The fire sales of Wachovia and National City to Wells Fargo and PNC Financial, respectively, took place under regulatory pressure to stabilise the banks’ deposit bases after heavy mortgage-related losses led to concerns over capital.Wells Fargo shares were 1.6 per cent lower at $26.99 and PNC shares were 0.8 per cent higher at $43.01.Textron, the manufacturer of Cessna jets, Bell helicopters and E-Z-Go golf carts, was the biggest faller in the S&P after it reduced its fourth-quarter outlook, citing the deteriorating economy. Its shares were down 20.5 per cent at $12.20.Citigroup, down 3.4 per cent at $6.50, was among the most traded stocks.The banking group announced on Tuesday that it had sold its Indian information technology subsidiary to India’s Wipro Technologies for $127m.Other financial groups also traded slightly lower.

Equity was provided by Clyde Blowers Capital fund ll LP, a private equity fund that had raised £225m by its first close last month and is expected to raise a further £25m. Boston-based HarbourVest Partners and Pantheon Ventures, based in the UK, are co-lead investors in the fund alongside Bank of Scotland and Swiss-based LGT Group. Clyde Blowers was assisted in raising the fund by JPMorgan Cazenove.Mr McColl says: “The bigger private equity funds relied more on financial engineering – gearing something way up, taking some cost out and then their equity proportion goes up.“That is going to be more difficult to do going forward, because they are not going to get the gearing – certainly in the short to medium term – that they got in the past, if it ever returns to what it was,” he says.“So a lot of the people who invest in private equity funds are sitting on their hands just now. But the ones who are doing something are looking for real added value from an operations team – and that is what attracted them to our team, our track record and the skills and knowledge we had demonstrated.”Having started in the unglamorous business of cleaning boilers, Clyde Blowers now has expertise in power generation, including nuclear power, oil and gas, water – both waste water and desalination – and the metals and minerals
industry. “We have been able to build up a lot of knowledge about those sectors,” says Mr McColl.Clyde Blowers, which delisted from the stock exchange in 1999, had previously financed its acquisitions on a deal-by-deal basis, but Mr McColl found this was becoming increasingly difficult.“My goal was to maybe get a portfolio of six or seven businesses, each with their own financial structure.” he says. “However, it became clear that if you’ve got different partners in each group there are conflicts – because every one of your partners wants you to focus the maximum amount of your time on the venture that they are in – and not on the others. So it became clear that a model that had the same partners in every deal would work quite well.”Clyde Blowers and its backers have established an eight-year fund, but Mr McColl hopes to triple the value of its investments over a three to five-year period.“We want to keep this to £250m to start with and look at raising our second fund in two years’ time. That would likely be quite a bit bigger.”In spite of the gloomy economic climate, Mr McColl is upbeat about his group’s prospects – particularly since its acquisition of Textron’s fluid and power
division.“We have been round all the businesses, they are all fairly focused on infrastructure-type projects such as the nuclear industry in China. We are the number one supplier of pumps in the world to the nuclear industry. The oil and gas sector is still generating good revenue, and another big areas is desalination and waste water.”It took Clyde Blowers and its backers nearly 18 months to set up the fund, and Mr McColl admits he was lucky to have been able to complete the Textron deal in September, before the banking meltdown.“We have found it is a good model. If you need to do an acquisition quickly, you decide – because the investors do not take any part in what you decide to do. Because of that they have to do a lot of diligence on you so they know they can trust you.“But now they have given us the money we can spend it however we like. If we spend it in a bad way we’ll not get anything else off them.”"
72;TXT;Textron Inc;2008-11-09T22:37:17Z;Business-jet makers cut production levels;;Weakening global economic growth is starting to hit production plans at leading business-jet makers, as new order volumes shrink and corporate and private flyers reduce activity.Cessna, a division of Textron of the US and the biggest maker of light and mid-sized corporate jets, is cutting its planned production for 2009 by more than 10 per cent “due to continued softening in the global economic environment”.Hawker Beechcraft, the former Raytheon Aircraft business that was sold last year to Onex Partners and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, said it was cutting production and was removing about 500 jobs, or 5 per cent of its 10,000 workforce.Jim Schuster, chief executive, has written to employees warning of the “very serious challenges” facing the group “due to the unprecedented worldwide economic decline. These events have had a serious impact on the global business climate in general and represent a serious risk to general aviation and Hawker Beechcraft,” he said.“The decline in wealth and available credit directly affects our customers’ ability to purchase new aircraft.”In common with most leading busines-jet makers, Hawker Beechcraft still had a record order backlogworth about $7bn, but Mr Schuster said the group was approaching 2009 “with extreme caution as we expect to see eventual erosion in new aircraft orders and deliveries – this could have a serious impact on cash flow”.The group was reducing production plans, inventories and capital expenditure, he said. Kansas-based Hawker Beechcraft said its operating profits had fallen from $62.1m to $15.3m in the third quarter, partly due to the impact of a four-week strike by its engineering workers in August.Cessna said its detailed planning was still under way but it forecast deliveries would only be “slightly up” on the 475 planned for 2008 instead of the previously planned 13 per cent increase to 535 jets. Revenues would be unchanged next year at about $5.9bn.Cessna accounts for about 40 per cent of Textron’s estimated total turnover for 2008 of $14.5bn.Cessna had a $15.6bn order backlog at the end of September.Business-jet service bases are reporting they are selling lower volumes of fuel, especially in the US, as private-jet flyers and corporate flight departments choose to fly less.The latest monthly business-jet report by UBS said flight activity was again sharply lower in September.
73;TXT;Textron Inc;2008-10-30T14:21:51Z;Defence and engineering: Naval contract may prove useful anchor;;Des Browne hailed it as a “historic day for defence” when he celebrated in July the signing of the £3bn contract to build the UK’s biggest aircraft carriers.Mr Browne, who was the UK’s defence secretary at the time, was speaking at BAE’s Govan yard on the River Clyde, where the workforce has been building Type 25 destroyers. The new order will support more than 3,000 jobs at BAE’s Govan and Scotstoun yards in Glasgow, and sustain 1,600 jobs at Babcock Marine’s naval dockyard at Rosyth on the Firth of Forth, where the ships will be assembled.The Ministry of Defence reiterated that the ships were still due to be in service in 2014 and 2016, in spite of a delay of more than six months in signing the contract.Confirmation of the long-awaited order gave an important counter-cyclical boost to the Scottish engineering sector, as it came only weeks before confirmation that the credit crunch had led to the sector’s first fall in order intake for almost five years.The latest quarterly review by Scottish Engineering, the support group for the industry, also found in September that while prices had risen in both UK and export markets, they had not matched the rises in fuel, energy or raw materials – so profit margins had tumbled.As expected, the oil and gas sector continued to perform strongly, but the survey found machine shops and mechanical engineering had been hit hard.Peter Hughes, chief executive of Scottish Engineering said: “The one area that goes against the negative trend is large companies, which are still reporting a positive order intake. The majority of companies are also reporting ongoing positive results in terms of output volume, but these are based on the positive intake figures for previous months. ”One large company benefiting from its work for the mining, oil and gas industries is the Glasgow-based Weir Group, which increased its profits by 75 per cent in the first half of the year. The group is also well diversified geographically and said the continuing industrialisation of China and India would continue to have a “tremendous effect” on its core businesses.Weir does not just benefit from strong capital spending by mining customers such as BHP and Rio Tinto. For every dollar of original equipment the group’s mineral division sells, it expects to make another $5 from spares across the life of the piece of equipment.Another boost for the manufacturing sector came in September when Clyde Blowers, the engineering group owned by Scottish entrepreneur Jim McColl, agreed to pay up to $645m (£369m) for the fluid and power division of Textron, the US group that makes Cessna business jets.The division comprises four separate businesses – two of which feature a famous name in British engineering. David Brown Gear Systems, based in Huddersfield, has 1,113 employees at 18 locations in 11 countries. David Brown Hydraulics, based in Poole, has 119 employees in nine countries.Union Pumps, a producer of highly engineered centrifugal and reciprocating pumps, is also included in the deal. It has 730 employees at 10 locations in six countries, including the UK, the US, Canada and France.Mr McColl said: “I am delighted to sign a deal of this magnitude, especially in the current economic climate. We are talking a total value of $1bn.”That figure included additional working capital, bonding facilities, and integration costs.Union Pumps will integrate with Clyde Pumps, the company formed last year by Mr McColl, 55, following his purchase from Weir Group of the Glasgow company Weir Pumps, where he had started his working life as a 16-year-old apprentice. The purchase saved 600 jobs as Weir had planned to sell Weir Pumps to Sulzer, a Swiss group, which intended to close the plant.Scottish Engineering found that in spite of a general drop in order intake (31 per cent up on the previous quarter, 35 per cent same, 34 per cent down) optimism was still high in the electronics and oil and gas sectors, as well as in large companies.UK prices across all sizes and sectors were extremely positive, as were export prices. But when the survey looked at UK profit margins and export margins it showed that there was a big gap between negative margins and the positive prices.Mr Hughes said: “On a more positive note, the weakening of sterling against the euro will certainly assist with exports, and companies which have been working hard on improving their productivity via a variety of lean programmes will be better placed to weather the storm.”
74;TXT;Textron Inc;2008-08-06T17:46:46Z;When some parts don’t fit;;It is rare for Jeffrey Immelt, the urbane and personable head of General Electric, to voice his displeasure at the back-seat chief executives who offer him unsolicited advice on how to run the US conglomerate.But in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Immelt found himself railing against the “trading culture” that has spread from Wall Street to corporate America.“People think that running GE is like driving a stagecoach: if horse number three breaks down, take it out and shoot it,” he said during a November 2006 interview. “It is a lousy way to run a company like GE.”Sometimes, though, even chief executives like Mr Immelt have to pull the trigger in shedding a beloved workhorse.GE said last month it would be likely to spin off its consumer and industrial division. A proud part of the company’s heritage – the electric toaster, washing machine and the incandescent light bulb were all invented there – the division’s focus on low-margin businesses turned it into a laggard within the portfolio. And its drag on the company’s overall growth rates had worsened amid the US economy’s slowdown.While GE could have made the investments necessary to revive the division’s prospects, such as expanding a distribution network for selling appliances outside the US, Mr Immelt and his team found more productive uses for that capital in other parts of the company.The dilemma is a familiar one to managers of many of the world’s conglomerates. Showing a knack for making the right calls on what to add or subtract is what defines a conglomerate’s success and is its leaders’ principal duty. Indeed, conglomerates have traditionally been built on the premise that their diverse set of businesses will enable them to outperform less diverse companies.As Chris Zook, head of the global strategy practice at Bain, the management consultancy, says: “Conglomerates tend to have around a third of their divisions in businesses they have no long-term logical reason to be in.”For executives, it is also knowing when to let go that counts. Supplanted long ago by energy, aviation and financial services as the drivers of GE’s profits, the C&I division nonetheless held more than just sentimental value to Mr Immelt and his predecessor, Jack Welch. The businesses made money, reliably churning out cash GE could plough into faster-growing operations or use to fund long-term research projects or finance acquisitions.“The more you want to focus on those businesses and invest in those businesses, the more you look around at the others and say, ‘Hey, does this really fit the profile?’ ’’ says Pam Daley, GE’s senior vice-president of corporate business development. “Then you have to make some tough decisions.”In his seven years at the helm, Mr Immelt has jettisoned more than $50bn in businesses. Gone are insurance, plastics and industrial supply, among others. “This is a 130-year-old company, and it does evolve,” Ms Daley says.Other conglomerates have, too. ITT, an industrial company whose sprawling corporate empire once also included hotel chains and life insurance arms, insists its divisions meet targets on revenue, return on invested capital, per-share earnings and free cash flow. At Textron, whose interests range from golf carts to Cessna corporate jets, each business is measured by its ability to increase its value by 15 per cent annually.“When you have a portfolio as diverse as ours, there is really no other way to compare businesses on an equal footing,” says Stuart Grief, vice-president of strategy and business development. “We use the exact same lens to look at acquisition targets.”Textron screens deals for their ability to capitalise on a list of 11 “megatrends” – sweeping concepts such as economic growth in developing countries, an aging population and limited natural resources. The system puts pressure squarely on divisional managers not only to meet performance objectives but to come up with new ideas.The process can often foster intense competition for resources even among those businesses considered “winners”. At ITT, unit managers present their best ideas to senior executives, who then determine how much the company will invest. “We have more good ideas for good growth than we can afford,” says Steve Loranger, ITT’s chief executive. “We put money on the best bets.”Even if a business has matured to a point where those growth targets are no longer realistic, the unit may still be worth hanging on to, Mr Grief says. “If it’s for cash and we need cash, then that’s value.”Indeed, that free cash flow in turn can be used to fund dividend payments, stock buybacks and, of course, acquisitions. “In some cases, the business is an important talent incubator,” Mr Grief says. “But if [generating cash] is all it is doing, that’s a tough one.”Severing ties to what was once a flagship business can also be gut-wrenching. “It’s never an easy decision,” says Sandy Cutler, chief executive of Eaton.Eleven years ago, Eaton sold what Mr Cutler calls the company’s “mother product line”, its axle and brake business. In the decade that followed, Eaton snapped up 42 companies.Today, those acquisitions contribute more than 70 per cent of Eaton’s revenue. “We don’t believe in the old cash cows,” Mr Cutler says. “People take enormous risks when they say, ‘We’ll hold this cow, and it won’t turn into green cheese.’ ”But the choice of whether to keep or sell a struggling subsidiary is influenced by more than a manager’s assessment of its long-term value. At times investors want more immediate gratification. While the decision to spin off C&I was not prompted by recent pressure on the company to lift its stock price, Ms Daley acknowledges that GE is in the “glare of public scrutiny all the time”.“We do the best we can to balance the long-term interests and the need to keep a healthy dividend, to deliver nice results and get good growth for our shareholders day to day,” she says.Nevertheless, companies such as Loews – a hotels to energy group that describes itself as an “unabashed and proud conglomerate” – tell investors to forget about quarterly earnings.James Tisch, Loews chief executive, says buying and selling to satisfy investors’ craving for quarterly gratification is just bad business. “We worry about long-term value. In a downturn, we don’t feel the pressure to sell poorly-performing businesses,” he says. “Our shareholders know and expect that in a downturn our earnings will go down.”
75;TXT;Textron Inc;2008-07-17T20:35:53Z;Wall Street rallies on banks’ earnings;;The S&P 500 rallied for a second session on Thursday and edged back out of bear market territory as better-than-expected results from JPMorgan and another sharp drop in oil prices cheered investors.The day began in ebullient mood with stocks rising sharply after a number of leading banks and fund managers reported results.JPMorgan said profit fell 52 per cent to $2bn due to costs from the takeover of Bear Stearns in March and mortgage-related writedowns. But that was a smaller fall than expected.Shares in JPMorgan rose 13.5 per cent to $40.80, adding to the biggest one-day gain in almost six years that they made on Wednesday.PNC Financial Services Group, the Pittsburgh-based bank, and BlackRock, the asset manager, also posted better-than-expected earnings, while Merrill Lynch soothed investors by selling its stake in Bloomberg back to the data and services company for $4.5bn.PNC rose 13.5 per cent to $65.75, BlackRock added 16.2 per cent to $207.98 and Merrill advanced 9.8 per cent to $30.73.An exception to the positive news was the Bank of New York Mellon, which said second-quarter profits slumped 31 per cent to $309m on costs related to certain tax issues. Its shares fell 7.3 per cent to $35.42.The financial sector as a whole jumped 6.1 per cent in early trading while an index of investment banking shares rose 7.3 per cent.Analysts warned that any relief rally was likely to be short-lived. A number of them downgraded or cut their earnings forecasts for Wells Fargo, whose estimate-beating results on Wednesday spurred the biggest ever gain in financial shares and the biggest one-day rally on the S&P 500 since April.Keith Horowitz, a Citigroup analyst, said: “We expect to see a pick up in dilutive capital raises in the third quarter and increased concerns about spillover into commercial credit quality, which should continue to pressure [banking] stocks.”The benchmark S&P 500 pared gains late in the day but still closed 1.2 per cent higher at 1,259.97 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.8 per cent to 11,438.92 points, while the Nasdaq Composite finished 1.2 per cent higher at 2,312.30 points.In the past few weeks, earnings reports have been one of the only bright spots in an avalanche of bad news centring on the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.With 11 per cent of S&P 500 companies having reported second-quarter earnings so far, 72 per cent have beat expectations, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The number is even more surprising given that 34 per cent of the companies that have reported were financials.Outside of the financial sector, earnings reports were mixed on Thursday however. Danaher and United Technologies both beat analysts’ quarterly earnings expectations thanks in part to solid overseas sales and a weaker dollar. Danaher rose 6.2 per cent to $80.90, while United climbed 5.9 per cent to $64.70.Textron, however, held the sector to a 1.5 per cent gain after it noted rising energy costs and the weaker economy and forecast third-quarter profits that fell short of expectations. Textron slid 5.9 per cent to $43.25.Coca-Cola also disappointed investors. The world’s largest soft-drink maker said second-quarter profit fell after writedowns at its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises. Coca-Cola holds a 35 per cent stake in Coca-Cola Enterprises.Coca-Cola fell 3.8 per cent to $50.34 while Coca-Cola Enterprises, which posted a $3.17bn second-quarter loss, fell 0.1 per cent to $16.83.Those results, and poor same-store sales forecasts from Safeway, knocked the consumer staples sector into the red. Safeway fell 10.8 per cent to $26.78, while the sector lost 0.5 per cent.Market gains were also limited by some poor macro-economic data showing moderately higher rates of unemployment and further weakness in the housing sector.In the background, oil prices fell for a third day, helping consumer-facing and energy-dependent stocks.Carnival rose 9.7 per cent to $36.42, while General Motors climbed 11.9 per cent to $12.85. Sherwin-Williams also rose 12.3 per cent to $53.86 after the paint retailer said second-quarter profit fell less than analysts estimated.
76;TXT;Textron Inc;2008-07-14T09:59:46Z;Helicopters: Fresh designs should lift speeds;;Some of the most exciting initiatives in rotorcraft involve aircraft that will turn the idea of the conventional helicopter on its head.But manufacturers are also busy coping with demand for existing models.“The types of conflict we’re seeing have turned into helicopter-based operations,” says Scott Starrett, vice-president of government programs at Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation of the US, a subsidiary of United Technologies.“Iraq is like Vietnam without the jungles,” says Bob “Too Tall” Kenney, vice-president for government programs at Bell Helicopter.Sikorsky’s Multi-Year VII contract with the US government, signed last year, is worth more than $7bn and involves more than 1,800 Black Hawks and Seahawk transport and light cargo helicopters.“International sales on the military side have gone up,” says Mr Starrett and are 20 per cent of the total.Sikorsky is chasing big potential orders from Turkey, Poland, Taiwan, Australia and Singapore. And parts supplied for the army upgrade programme in Texas are “running at about $100m a year”.The backlog at Sikorsky as a whole is more than $12bn, with the military side accounting for two-thirds of that. Manufacturing capacity has been expanded, including a new facility in Poland that will become a body manufacturer for Army M model Black Hawks.The company also has high hopes for the armed Battlehawk, as a new build or upgrade. And it intends to have on static display at Farnborough this week a militarised version of its S92.Eurocopter last year derived 49 per cent of its €4.1bn ($6.5bn) revenues from defence sales, in keeping with its aim of cross-fertilising civil and military sides.The NH90, a collaboration with AgustaWestland among others, is the largest military helicopter programme in Europe, with orders for 507 aircraft.Last month, Brazil and Eurocopter signed a deal to produce a Super Cougar variant of its AS532 transport in Brazil.At AgustaWestland, a Finmeccanica subsidiary, military business accounted for 75 per cent of its €3bn revenue. By 2010, the split is expected to have moved to 70 per cent military. At the end of last year, the backlog was €9bn, of which about 70 per cent was military.Its helicopters cover most of the range. The largest, at 16 tonnes, is the UK-built AW101, called the Merlin in the UK and the one chosen over domestic rivals for the US presidential chopper.The UK has ordered 70 Future Lynx helicopters from AgustaWestland for the army and navy, with the first aircraft due late next year. Turkey recently ordered 50 AW129 attack helicopters, with options on another 412, to be built in Turkey.At Bell Helicopter, a division of Textron, the largest programme is the Osprey Tilt-Rotor, now in production in collaboration with Boeing. Its first deployment in Iraq was free of significant problems, says Mr Kenney, a former Marine helicopter pilot.The V-22 Osprey showed the advantages of its speed, range and noise signature. “If you’re a terrorist with a Sam missile hearing a helicopter, you’ve got time to finish your breakfast and go and shoot at it,” he says. “With the V-22 it’s on top of them before they know it.”Blade erosion in Iraq’s sandy conditions was less of an issue than expected, but the “largest hit for Bell was the engine/air particle separators,” says Mr Kenney. Problems with the hydraulically driven separators resulted in a few engine fires, but the issue was resolved about a month ago.Bell won the Armed Reconnaisance Helicopter contract to supply 512 ARH-70s, worth $5.4bn, although the programme became plagued by political problems.Bell and Boeing are working on a four-propeller quad-tilt-rotor concept for heavy-lift requirements from the US and Europe. Mr Kenney describes it as “two V-22s on top of a C130 Hercules size fuselage”.In-service use of the Osprey is also highlighting the need for small vertical take-off aircraft with the speed to escort the V-22. The top speed of helicopters is restricted by retreating-blade stall of the main rotors.The European company has looked at other solutions but is not actively pursuing any. But across the Atlantic, Sikorsky has dusted off its design for an aircraft with dual, coaxial, counter-rotating rotor systems, with a rear pusher propeller giving it a top speed of 250kt.Piasecki of the US has also revived old designs with its proposal to upgrade Black Hawks with a pusher propeller and fixed wings. Mil and Kamov of Russia also have designs for helicopters with pusher propellers to increase top speed.The Bell Agusta BA609, on track for certification in 2011, is a smaller tilt-rotor that would lend itself for militarisation – AgustaWestland will have a military mock-up on display at Farnborough.
77;TXT;Textron Inc;2008-04-18T20:48:26Z;Wall St rises sharply ending week higher;;"Wall Street stocks cantered towards the weekend break, climbing for a fourth straight session on Friday after Citigroup posted first-quarter results that were worse than some expected but better than many feared and Google impressed investors with resilient earnings.The biggest US bank posted its second quarterly loss in a row on writedowns of about $12bn. Revenue fell by almost half, but that was better than a number of analysts had forecast.During the past year Citigroup shares have lost more than half their value amid a slew of writedowns, but on Friday they clawed back 4.5 per cent to $25.11 and were 7.5 per cent ahead for the week. Other financial stocks rallied on the news. Bank of America rose 2.9 per cent to $38.56 and Lehman Brothers added 4.3 per cent to $45.50. The S&P 500 financials index gained 1.8 per cent on the day and 5.2 per cent for the week.Google also made ground. Overnight, the internet search company delivered revenues and earnings well ahead of estimates for the first quarter thanks to overseas growth. Google surged 20 per cent to $539.41 as a number of analysts significantly raised target prices for the stock, citing the company’s ability to skip past signs of a US slowdown.Stocks eased off their highs towards the close but the benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 1.8 per cent at 1,390.34 on the day and 4.3 per cent ahead for the week – its best finish since February.The Nasdaq Composite added 2.6 per cent to 2,402.97 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.8 per cent to 12,849.36.Positive earnings reports from a number of large US corporations this week helped soothe fears a US economic slowdown would hit profits, sparking a broad-based market rally and sending measures of volatility to their lowest levels this year.Technology companies have led the way. On Tuesday Intel, the semiconductor titan, offered a ray of hope to the beleaguered sector with solid results and upbeat forecasts for the full year.That news was followed by sturdy earnings reports from Ebay and IBM. Over the week Intel rose 6.2 per cent to $22.55, Ebay added 2.7 per cent to $31.71 and IBM rose 7.2 per cent to $124.40.Industrial stocks found momentum this week on the back of strong earnings
from conglomerates such as United Technologies, CSX, and Textron.Those results reassured investors that diversified international companies can find growth abroad to offset soft domestic markets, and they helped overturn losses in the sector triggered by disappointing results from industrial bellwether General Electric last Friday.Upbeat results from Honeywell International and Caterpillar on Friday bolstered that rally, pushing an index of industrial stocks up 4.7 per cent for the week.Honeywell added 6.3 per cent to $60.99 on Friday while Caterpillar shares rose 8.5 per cent to $85.28.During the week UTC, CSX and Textron climbed
4.3 per cent to $72.51, 8.8 per cent to $61.24 and 6.7 per cent to $60.97 respectively.In spite of a series of massive losses and writedowns begun by Wachovia on Monday and capped by Citigroup on Friday, financial stocks for the most part performed well this week.The run began on Tuesday after a handful of regional banks, including Regions Financial and M&T Bank, cheered investors with
better-than-expected results.Those results were followed by mostly inline earnings reports from JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch.Investors responded positively, sending JPMorgan shares up 7.6 per cent to $45.76 and Merrill shares up 8.4 per cent to $47.35 for the week. But analysts were wary, pointing to “problem” assets, a slowing economy and the rising costs of funding as potential headwinds.Analyst are also sceptical about equity market resilience in the face of macro- economic data showing weakening growth, rising inflation and continued distress in the capital markets.“To us, the Pollyanna-ish calm expressed by the equity market relative to the grim reality displayed in numerous credit-market indicators is a source of constant difficulty,” said Rob Carnell of INGMany believe expectations of about 7 per cent earnings growth from S&P 500 companies excluding financials remain far too optimistic.The sector for which forecasts remain highest however was the leading gainer during the week. Energy stocks rallied strongly, up 7.7 per cent, on the back of record high oil prices.BJ Services and Baker Hughes led the sector, climbing 16.3 per cent to $33.21 and 12.5 per cent to $80.80 over the week."
78;TXT;Textron Inc;2008-04-17T20:47:45Z;Wall Street rebound lead by financials;;In a muted session of trading US stock markets went sideways on Thursday as investors weighed a mixed batch of earnings reports and an unlikely rally in the downtrodden financial and consumer discretionary sectors offset losses in healthcare and industrials.Highlighting the ambivalence of much of the day’s earnings news were industrial conglomerates including United Technologies Corp, Danaher and Textron. The trio posted estimate-beating first-quarter profits but cautious outlook statements from UTC and Danaher dented the stocks.UTC fell 2.5 per cent to $70.79, Danaher lost 3.5 per cent to $74.16 and Textron dropped 2.8 per cent to $60.44, dragging the S&P industrials sector down 0.8 per cent.Pfizer also stumbled. The shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $20.40 after the drugmaker said first-quarter profits fell as generic medicines cut into its sales.The news hit competitors Eli Lilly and Merck, which fell 2.2 per cent to $51.39 and 2.7 per cent to $39.22 respectively, knocking 0.8 per cent off the healthcare sector.Meanwhile, a pessimistic outlook statement from Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone company, hurt US rival Motorola, whose shares slid 1.6 per cent to $9.05.By the close, however, a rally in financials helped markets limp into positive territory for a third day in a row. The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the day 0.1 per cent ahead at 1,365.54.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 2,341.83 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly flat for the day at 12,620.16.Positive earnings news from IBM overnight and Google after the close on Thursday which both beat expectations, helped extend a rally in technology stocks that began on Wednesday when bellwether Intel released strong results and forecasts.IBM climbed 2.2 per cent to $123.08. Google said first-quarter profits jumped 30 per cent as expansion abroad more than compensated for a slowdown in advertising spending in the US. Google shares surged 11.8 per cent to $502.66 in after-hours trade.There were other bright spots on Thursday. Trading in the financial sector began in desultory fashion after Merrill Lynch reported its third quarterly loss in a row on $6.5bn of writedowns and said it would slash jobs to reduce costs.But that was broadly in-line with expectations and, by the close, investors had shrugged off the bad news sending Merrill shares, which have lost about half their value in the past year, up 4.1 per cent to $46.71.Its peers, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley, rose 4.6 per cent to $43.64 and 2.2 per cent to $46.42 respectively, while the S&P Financials index gained 1.4 per cent.MGIC, the biggest US mortgage insurer, soared 19 per cent to $12.49 after it lost less money in the first quarter than expected. Be-leagured bond insurers Ambac and MBIA also made ground, adding 8.7 per cent to $5.76 and 9.1 per cent to $12.71 respectively.Supervalu, the second-biggest US supermarket chain, gained 5.3 per cent to $30.60 after it said fourth-quarter profit rose more than analysts had estimated.Leggett & Platt led the consumer discretionary sector 0.4 per cent higher. Shares in the maker of supports for car seats jumped 14.6 per cent to $16.45 on an analyst upgrade.So far this year, the S&P 500 has fallen about 7 per cent as investors worry that a slowing US economy will begin to dent corporate profits. Analysts predict that first-quarter earnings will drop 12.3 per cent in total – a number many see as still too optimistic.For the most part investors skipped past a series of economic reports released on Thursday morning that added depressing details – rising unemployment and a slump in manufacturing activity – to the picture, of stagnation in the US.Materials stocks were also in focus on Thursday.

79;TXT;Textron Inc;2008-03-11T19:27:17Z;Engineering: Grand old names are gone but survivors find success;;Yorkshire Fittings (YF), the UK market leader in the manufacture of fittings and valves for the plumbing industry, and 600 Group, the UK’s biggest machine tool maker, are reminders that there are some traditional engineering companies in West Yorkshire that are still going strong.“A lot of the engineering business has migrated overseas,” says Mike Saunders, YF’s managing director. “But we think it is important for our customers to be able to offer them a rapid response and not have to wait eight weeks for it to be shipped from the Far East.”YF, part of the Dutch Aalberts Industries, and the quoted 600 Group, have shrunk their workforces over the years. But they have survived because of their strong brand names, good design and development skills, and heavy investment in automation.Their success contrasts with the gloomy message coming out of official statistics. Over the five years to the end of 2005, numbers employed in engineering in West Yorkshire fell 26 per cent, to 42,600, according to Leeds City Council’s economic handbook. The decline was in line with the national average.Andy Tierney, who heads the northern operations of headhunters Jonathan Lee Recruitment, says that numbers employed in engineering in West Yorkshire are still declining but there are “lots of individual companies that are doing reasonably well”.Dave Wilson, of the Yorkshire branch of the Engineering Employers Federation (EEF), agrees, noting that while numbers employed are expected to continue falling, engineering production is on a rising trend. Most Yorkshire engineering companies have successfully refocused and restructured themselves to meet the challenges of globalisation.One of the problems of measuring the health of West Yorkshire’s engineering industry is the absence of local flagship names, such as Sheffield’s Dyson Group, Derby’s Rolls-Royce or GKN in the West Midlands.Many of the grand old names of the West Yorkshire engineering industry, such as Yorkshire Imperial Metals, Vickers’ Challenger tank factory in Leeds, or Thorn EMI’s giant Bradford TV factory, have long gone.However, several of the big names of the past still survive, albeit under different ownership.Schneider Electric, one of the world’s biggest electrical transmission companies, took over Yorkshire Switchgear in 1989, and this is now the hub of the French company’s successful UK operation. Meanwhile Huddersfield’s Holset Engineering, the world’s leading manufacturer of turbochargers for commercial diesel engines, is now the global headquarters for Cummins Turbo Technologies.Huddersfield’s David Brown, another great Yorkshire engineering name, is still making gearboxes, as a subsidiary of US industrial conglomerate Textron. Shipley’s Marston Radiators, another automotive supplier, is now the UK manufacturing hub for Denso Marston, part of Japan’s Denso, and employs more than 1,000 staff in West Yorkshire.Cummins has invested heavily in Holset, and the West Yorkshire operations of companies ranging from Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy, (medical technology) to Sulzer Pumps prove that many of the most successful engineering companies in Yorkshire have benefited from the extra investment that can come with foreign ownership.Not that West Yorkshire is lacking its own home-grown engineering success stories. Ilkley’s NG Bailey, a large building services contractor with more than 4,000 staff and £500m ($1bn) revenues, is a family-owned business that has been operating for more than 80 years. It regularly wins awards for its mechanical and electrical engineering skills and its NG Bailey Engineering Academy in Leeds can train up to 500 apprentices.But West Yorkshire engineering’s greatest growth potential is based on the rising number of electronics companies clustered around Bradford. Some, such as Filtronic, were set up by former Leeds University academics, while others, most notably Pace Micro Technology, a leading technology developer for global payTV industry, and Eldon Technology, an electronics design house now owned by Echostar of the US, can trace their origins back to engineers who worked at the new product research centre of the former Radio Rentals TV factory in Bradford.These companies in turn are starting to spawn new high-technology companies, such as Red Embedded, which was spun out of Pace in 2004 and specialises in the design and development of digital consumer audio visual products.The Advanced Digital Institute (ADI), an independent research and development institute, was recently set up in Bingley to encourage more high-technology electronic businesses to locate in West Yorkshire. Although it has been backed by Yorkshire Forward it is generating its own revenues from research contracts and is well on its way to being able to fund itself when the public sector money runs out in five years time.
80;TXT;Textron Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Cessna goes for long haul;;Cessna Aircraft, a subsidiary of Textron of the US, is to develop its first intercontinental executive jet.The move takes it into direct competition in the market for large business jets with France’s Dassault, Canada’s Bombardier and Gulfstream of the US.Development costs for the new range, to be named the Citation Columbus, are expected to total around $780m.Cessna said it was aiming for first flight in 2011, certification by the aviation authorities by 2013 with deliveries to start in 2014.The aircraft maker has selected Pratt & Whitney Canada to supply its new PW810 engine range to power the Citation Columbus after a tough competition against offerings from Rolls-Royce and Snecma.The deal is the launch contract for the new generation PW800 series of jet engines producing up to 10,000lbs thrust.Alain Bellemare, president of P&WC, said the win represented “a multibillion opportunity” in potential orders over the life of the programme and would open doors to both the large-cabin, long-range corporate and the regional jet markets.Cessna is the biggest maker of business jets by volume but has previously concentrated its efforts in the market segments for light and mid-size jets, where it is the dominant supplier.It is also one of the pioneers of the emerging segment for very light jets with its Citation Mustang for which it started deliveries last year.The Citation Columbus is designed to overcome the group’s absence from the most lucrative segment of the fast-growing business jet market, however, where demand is particularly strong in international markets outside North America.In the last two years international markets have begun to exceed demand from the US, traditionally the dominant buyer of private jets.Cessna said that business jet orders from outside the US accounted for 53 per cent of its total jet orders last year, which rose by 48 per cent to a record 773.It said its delvieries of business jets rose from 307 in 2006 to 387 last year and were forecast to rise again to 470 this year. Deliveries increased by 50 per cent between 2005 and 2007.Lewis Campbell, Textron chief executive, said the planned range of large cabin jets was “an important strategic step” in the long term positioning of the Cessna product range in the global market place.The strength of demand is encouraging several leading business jet makers, including Bombardier and Dassault, to embark on the development of new products, supported crucially by advances made by the engine makers.P&WC’s selection to power the Citation Columbus follows Rolls-Royce’s victory last summer in a hotly contested competition to supply a new corporate jet engine in the 10,000lbs thrust range, the RB282, for a range of super-midsize business jets being planned by France’s Dassault. It defeated rival jet engine makers including P&WC, General Electric, Honeywell and Snecma.The RB282, potentially the first in a family of small engines for the corporate and regional jet market, is to be assembled and tested at a new plant to be built by the UK jet engine group in Virginia in the US.The Dassault contract for Rolls-Royce and the Cessna contract for P&WC are the first breakthroughs for the engine makers in a key segment of the business jet market. They establish the first routes to market for major new engine technology programmes.The fuselage and tail section for the Columbus are to be supplied by Spirit AeroSystems.Cessna said the Citation Columbus, priced at $27m (at 2008 prices) would have a range of 4,000 nautical miles at a cruising speed of Mach 0.8 carrying eight passengers. It will be the largest and longest range business jet ever built by Cessna.

Technology stocks were particularly weak after an analyst downgraded several semiconductor companies.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7 per cent to 13,043.96 points, its worst percentage decline on the first trading day of a year since 1983. The S&P 500 closed 1.4 per cent lower at 1,447.16 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.6 per cent to 2,609.63.The Institute for Supply Management’s survey showed that manufacturing weakened unexpectedly in December. The ISM index fell 3.1 percentage points to 47.7 last month, against expectations it would be little changed. A reading of 50 marks the line between growth and contraction.“Clearly the worries that we finished 2007 with are continuing into 2008, with these ISM numbers coming out so weak,” Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said. “The Fed is caught between a rock and a hard place trying to fight inflation while dealing with the slowdown in US growth.”Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting emphasised the difficulty of “unusually uncertain” economic conditions and indicated the Fed remained “exceptionally alert” to the possible need for further rate cuts.The futures market fully priced in the likelihood of at least a 25 basis point cut at the end of this month compared with a 68 per cent chance a week ago.Semiconductor stocks were sold after Banc of America Securities downgraded eight companies – three of them to “sell” – saying a cyclical recovery had run its course, while inventories had risen above equilibrium levels.BofA analyst Sumit Dhanda cut Intel to “neutral” and told investors to sell shares in Advanced Micro Devices. The shares fell 4.9 per cent to $25.35 and 4.8 per cent to $7.14 respectively. The PHLX semiconductor sector index lost 2.9 per cent to 396.34.Also in the chip sector Qualcomm fell 2.4 per cent to $38.39 after it said it expected an “immediate short-term impact” from a court ruling that it must halt chip sales that infringe patents belonging to Broadcom. Broadcom gained 1.5 per cent to $26.52.Amazon outperformed after Citigroup told investors to buy the shares citing expectations of strong revenue growth and margin expansion. The shares gained 3.9 per cent to $96.25.Transport groups struggled as oil prices soared and after JPMorgan downgraded FedEx from “overweight” to “neutral” because of weak freight demand and higher fuel costs. The shares fell 3.9 per cent to $86.16.YRC Worldwide, the trucking company, fell 9.7 per cent to $15.43 after warning it expected to incur charges in the fourth quarter related to previous acquisitions. Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell 5 per cent to $26.82 after Goldman Sachs said that cost inflation was acting as a large offset to cost savings activity.Investors also sold restaurant chains after Bear Stearns downgraded the sector to “underweight”. Analyst Joseph Buckley cut Starbucks to “peer perform” from “outperform” because he expects less affluent consumers will start to feel economic pressures. The stock fell 5.7 per cent to $19.31.Shares in Industrial companies declined after the ISM report and as Citi downgraded Textron, the industrial conglomerate, to “hold” from “buy”. The shares fell 6.3 per cent to $66.81.Financials fell heavily as National City said it would slash its dividend by almost 50 per cent and that it planned to raise more capital to cope with credit market turmoil. The shares dropped 5.3 per cent to $15.59. The S&P investment bank index shed 3.5 per cent with Morgan Stanley, down 4.1 per cent at $50.95 and Lehman Brothers, 5 per cent weaker at $62.19.Newmont Mining, the world’s second largest gold producer, rose 7.3 per cent to $52.39, the best performer on the S&P, as gold prices surged to a record high.As oil prices rose, energy stocks benefited. Transocean, the world’s largest offshore drilling company gained 2 per cent to $145.95.
82;TXT;Textron Inc;2007-11-27T19:17:58Z;Secrets of the must-read autobiography;;I am fascinated by the psychology and personalities of entrepreneurs so I read their autobiographies avidly. These books are a mixed bunch. Many of the most intriguing figures never put pen to paper, while others who do produce memoirs that are almost unreadable. Invariably they never do it for the money – one assumes it is ego and a desire to tell their story. But there are certainly some volumes worthy of study.The pioneer was probably Andrew Carnegie, the billionaire steel baron from Dunfermline, reputedly one of the richest self-made men of all time. He was also a great philanthropist and gave most of his fortune away. His 1920 autobiography is a decent read and an excellent insight into the extraordinary industrialisation of America in the early 20th century.Ray Kroc, the fast-food pioneer who created McDonald’s, wrote an autobiography with the revealing title of Grinding It Out. He was a tough, unsentimental man who invented an entire industry and built the world’s largest restaurant chain. For anyone interested in the food business it is essential reading.One of the finest books I’ve ever read about venture capital was written by a man called Roy Little, with the eccentric title of How to Lose $100,000,000 and Other Valuable Advice. He ran a legendary conglomerate called Textron, which he developed in the go-go 1960s. Later he was a pathfinder in private equity, and relates his investing ups and downs with refreshing modesty.Another inspiring tale of an industrial empire is the late Nigel Broackes’s autobiography, A Growing Concern, about Trafalgar House. His group owned Cunard, the Ritz, construction companies and the Daily Express, among other assets. I bought a yacht that had once been owned by Mr Broackes: it was an expensive mistake I shall not be repeating. But his book is worth getting.More recently I found James Dyson’s story, Against the Odds, an impressive work – a bit like his vacuum cleaners. It describes how he spent a decade in a shed perfecting his invention and has since gone on to become one of Britain’s most successful industrialists as well as an evangelist for design.There are, however, plenty of simply awful memoirs by rich businessmen. Sumner Redstone’s A Passion to Win is poorly written and dull, even though he has had an eventful life. It is proof that even though you can make money and own world-class media assets, it doesn’t make you a great communicator. Similarly, “Chainsaw” Al Dunlap’s book Mean Business is a case study in conceit and delusion. A turnround expert who specialised in sacking staff with relish, he got his comeuppance when the appliance maker Sunbeam fell apart along with his reputation.This year provides a reasonable crop of magnates telling their tales. Alfred Taubman, the retail mall developer who went to jail for antitrust violations, has written of his downfall at Sotheby’s in Threshold Resistance. It’s worth reading if you’re a retailer or in the auction game. And ex-jeweller Gerald Ratner has published the tale of his decline and recovery in The Rise and Fall…and Rise Again. He once gave a speech at a club I organised and is easily the funniest entrepreneurial orator I’ve ever heard. His book is painful, especially about his fateful “prawn sandwich” speech and his sister’s suicide after their parents disapproved of her proposal to marry outside her religion. The book is self-effacing, revealing and human.By contrast, I was recently sent Sir Ronald Cohen’s book, The Second Bounce of the Ball. It is hard to believe this book would have been published if the writer had not been very rich and well connected. He may have started the buy-out giant Apax but his book, which is billed as a guide for entrepreneurs rather than an autobiography, is boring beyond belief. I’ve bought two investments from Apax – a dental company and a restaurant business. Both were troubled situations, and in each case we fixed them and made money. Of course, it is a successful organisation overall, but its founder misses the point about books written by entrepreneurs. What readers really want to know are details of the setbacks and struggles, and what really makes business builders tick. The rest is padding.Lukej@riskcapitalpartners.co.ukThe writer is chairman of Channel 4 and runs Risk Equity Partners, a private equity firm
83;TXT;Textron Inc;2006-10-16T21:16:16Z;NetJets orders 30 Raytheon aircraft;;NetJets Europe, part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group and the leading operator of business aircraft in Europe, placed an order on Monday for 30 jets from Raytheon Aircraft of the US valued at more than $350m at list prices.Delivery of the 30 Hawker 750 executive jets, for which NetJets Europe will be the first customer, will begin in the first quarter of 2008 and will be completed between 2010 and 2012.NetJets Europe is already adding 27 more aircraft to its fleet this year, taking the total to 116, as it exploits rapid growth in Europe for private aviation.It has spent nearly $750m in the two years 2005 and 2006 on aircraft supplied chiefly from Raytheon and Cessna, a subsidiary of Textron, of the US.NetJets Europe expects to take delivery of 25-30 more aircraft next year.Last month, it placed the biggest order by value for corporate jets in Europe so far with an agreement to buy 24 Falcon 7X jets from Dassault, the French aircraft maker.That order was worth about $1.1bn.
84;TXT;Textron Inc;2006-10-16T17:06:49Z;Embraer: Brazilian manufacturer aims to break into big league;;Embraer, the Brazilian aircraft maker, has set its sights on breaking into the established ranks of the world’s leading business jet makers.In the last 10 years it has already become the world’s leading maker of regional jets – commercial aircraft of up to 100 seats – overtaking its Canadian rival Bombardier.“Our vision is to cover every niche of the market, but this is a development step by step,” said Mauricio Botelho, Embraer chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times. “It is progressing on a very firm timescale. In 10 years’ time we will be a very relevant player.”Turnover from corporate jets was forecast to rise from less than $200m last year to more than $600m in 2006, he said Mr Botelho has been the architect of the emergence of Embraer as one of the world’s leading aircraft makers and he is intent on building business jets into a second leg for the group alongside regional jets.The business jet sector is far more fragmented than regional commercial jets, where Embraer and Bombardier are the only substantial players.The Brazilian group faces tough competition from Gulfstream, a subsidiary of General Dynamics, and Cessna, a subsidiary of Textron, both of the US, Bombardier of Canada and France’s Dassault.Another player, Raytheon Aircraft, is being offered for sale by the parent Raytheon group, the US defence and missiles concern, which is seeking to concentrate on its core defence business.Raytheon said in the summer that Credit Suisse, the investment bank, had been hired to explore a “potential sale of the business, an initial public offering or spin-off to shareholders or some combination thereof.”Embraer’s first foray into business aicraft has been focused on its Legacy 600, a super midsize business jet derived from its E145 regional jet. Deliveries of the Legacy, priced at $24.7m and with capacity to seat up to 16 passengers, are building up to around three a month. The aircraft was launched at the UK Farnborough airshow in 2000 and first entered service a year later.The group shipped 13 Legacy 600s to customers in 2004 and 20 in 2005. Deliveries are expected to rise to 25-30 a year in 2006 and 2007.It is making another incursion into the market at the top end with the recent launch of the Lineage 1000 jet in the ultra-large class of aircraft based on airliners. Derived from the E190 regional jet, the Lineage 1000 is expected to enter service in the second half of 2008, with 3-4 deliveries planned for 2009.Priced at $40.95m and with a capacity for up to 19 passengers, the Lineage 1000 will have a range with eight passengers of 4,200 nautical miles (7,800kms) allowing it to fly non-stop from London to New York, Moscow to Tokyo or Dubai to Tokyo or Johannesburg.Embraer’s biggest gamble to date, however, in rolling out its corporate jet strategy is the development of an all-new family of aircraft at the bottom end of the market, as it seeks to be one of the leading players in the newly emerging market segment for very light jets.As at the end of June Embraer had a total order backlog of $1.25bn for business jets, and it had already taken 235 orders for the new Phenom 100 and 300 jets announced in the first half of 2005.Deliveries of the Phenom 100 very light jet are due to begin in mid-2008 with production of 15-20 aircraft planned by the end of that year. Deliveries of the Phenom 300 light jet should start in the second half of 2009 with combined production forecast to total 120-150 aircraft.The Phenom 100, priced at $2.85m (at January 2005 economic conditions), will seat four passengers and have a range of 1,160 nautical miles (2,148kms), while the Phenom 300 light jet will have room for 9 passengers and a range of 1,800 nautical miles (3,334kms). It is priced at $6.65m (January 2005 conditions).Embraer’s attempt to break into the very light jet segment was given significant support earlier this year when it was chosen by JetBird, a start up Geneva-based company, that is planning to introduce one of the first pan-European air taxi services.JetBird placed a firm order for 50 Phenom 100 jets with options for another 50 aircraft. The contract allows JetBird to convert the positions into either Phenom 100s or 300s, and it is due to take delivery of its first aircraft in April 2009.Domnhal Slattery, the founder of JetBird and a former head of Royal Bank of Scotland’s aviation capital division, says the group is seeking “to revolutionise the executive travel market in a manner similar to the low-cost airline transformation of the commercial air travel market.”The Embraer Phenom aircraft has been chosen, he says, to achieve high aircraft utilisation and efficient turnaround times in order to keep operating costs low.With the use of the Phenom 100, chosen against US competitors such as the Eclipse 500 and the Cessna Mustang, JetBird is aiming to bring executive jet travel to a market for whom it has previously been too expensive, he says.JetBird is seeking to develop Europe’s first “low cost, on-demand, executive jet service” initially from Zurich in 2009, and subsequently from other major European cities.
85;TXT;Textron Inc;2006-05-01T21:18:01Z;Netjets Europe adds to its fleet;;Netjets Europe, the biggest operator of business jets in Europe, is adding a further 30 aircraft this year valued at $445m at list prices to expand its fleet by a third to 119 by the end of 2006.The group, part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, said it would have invested nearly $750m in new aircraft in the two years 2005 and 2006 with large orders placed chiefly with Raytheon and Cessna, a subsidiary of Textron, of the US.It is also purchasing long-range jets from Gulfstream, a subsidiary of General Dynamics of the US, which have the capability to fly non-stop from London to Beijing or to Los Angeles, and from France’s Dassault.Mark Booth, Netjets Europe chief executive, said the group had ended a decade of losses since its launch in 1996 and had been achieving an operating profit since the second half of 2005.He said the European operation would be profitable at an operating level in 2006 and there was a “50-50 chance” of achieving a net profit for the first time this year. “I guarantee a net profit in 2007,” he told the Financial Times.Netjets Europe has been expanding rapidly and claims to be the ninth-largest airline in Europe by fleet size. It has a commercial air operator’s certificate (AOC) through Netjets Transportes Aereos (NTA), based in Lisbon, which is regulated by the Portuguese civil aviation authority. To qualify as a European union carrier it is 49 per cent owned by Netjets of the US and 51 per cent by European investors, whose identity it refuses to disclose. It has become one of the leading recruiters of pilots in Europe with a pilot workforce of 580 in a total European workforce of around 1,200, which includes 380 at its Lisbon operations headquarters and 100 sales, marketing and finance staff in London.Mr Booth, the former News Corp executive and former head of BSkyB, said Netjets Europe had recently signed its 1,000th customer after recruiting 400 new customers in 2005 to its corporate fractional ownership and card membership programmes.It has grown from a base of 89 customers in January 2002, and Mr Booth forecast it would have more than 1,200 by the end of the year.The recent expansion of the customer base has come through the popularity of jet card membership schemes in Europe, which are attracting an increasing number of wealthy individual customers, who prefer the simplicity of buying private jet travel by the hour rather than purchasing a fraction of ownership of an aircraft.Prices for the Netjets card schemes start at £85,000 ($155,000) for 25 hours of occupied flying time of a small private jet.Mr Booth said the business was still chiefly based on fractional jet ownership by big European corporations, however, which accounted for 78 per cent of the flying hours of the Netjets Europe fleet and included 10 of the companies in the Eurostoxx 50 index of leading European corporations.The improvement in the profitability of the Netjets Europe operation has been in contrast with the performance of Netjets in the US, which “dipped far into the red,” according to the latest letter to shareholders by Mr Buffett in the Berkshire Hathaway annual report.“I said last year that this business would earn money in 2005,” said Mr Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway chairman, “but I was dead wrong.”Netjets fell to a pre-tax loss of $80m in 2005 from a pre-tax profit of $10m in 2004.

The bond, which matures in 2015, was priced to yield 55 basis points above the mid-swap rate, at the tight end of the price guidance after nearly 200 investors placed orders worth more than €2bn.More than 60 per cent of the bonds were sold to investors outside Germany.“The trade was a great diversification play for investors, with an improving credit story that still offered a little bit of yield,” said Mark Dodd at West LB, which managed the sale with ABN Amro and Commerzbank. “Investors didn’t have a lot of this name on their books.”S&P last month upgraded ThyssenKrupp to BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating. Moody’s Investors Service rates the company Baa2 and Fitch Ratings has assigned a BBB+ rating.Following a quiet February, activity in the corporate primary market picked up this week with euro issues from DaimlerChrysler, the German carmaker, and Textron, the US industrial conglomerate. But demand for new bonds still outweighs supply.“Though we have had close on €2.5bn worth of supply this week, it is clearly not enough to satisfy a market that has been running short on new issues for the best part of 14 months,” said Suki Mann, credit strategist at SG CIB.Rede Ferroviaria Nacional, the state-owned Portuguese railway operator known as Refer, sold €600m of bonds with a 10-year maturity. The bond was priced to yield 20bp above the mid-swap rate. JP
Morgan and Merrill Lynch lead-managed the sale.Toyota Motor Credit, the financing division of the Japanese automaker, sold $1bn of global bonds with a maturity of five years. The bonds, which will pay a coupon of 4.25 per cent, were priced to yield 37bp over the comparable Treasury.Toyota is one of the few corporate borrowers that retains a AAA-rating.In the sovereign market, Belgium hired four banks to sell a new 10-year benchmark. ABN Amro, Barclays Capital, HSBC and KBC lead-managed the sale. Belgium is rated Aa1 by Moody’s Investors Service, AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and AA by Fitch Ratings."

The bond, which has a maturity of January 2037, was priced at a yield premium of 26 basis points above the 4 per cent 2037 German government bond, in the middle of the 25bp-27bp guidance. BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and the National Bank of Greece managed the sale.The Dutch state treasury agency said it was considering issuing a bond with a maturity slightly longer than 30 years. The agency said it had hired three banks to examine whether investors wanted a 10-year or a 30-year bond.The bond will be sold through a direct auction in the second half of March or April. If it issues a 30-year bond, a new 10-year would be launched “a few months later”, the agency said.Supply in the corporate bond market was picking up, and ThyssenKrupp, the German steelmaker, attracted orders worth more than €1.75bn for its first bond sale since Standard & Poor’s upgraded the company to investment-grade status three weeks ago.The company was expected to sell €750m of bonds with a 10-year maturity at a yield spread of 55bp above the mid-swap rate, at the tight end of the 55bp-58bp guidance.S&P upgraded ThyssenKrupp to BBB- on February 10. Fitch rates the company BBB+ and Moody’s has assigned a Baa2 rating.ThyssenKrupp said it wanted to “lock in currently attractive long-term funding and extend its debt maturity profile”. ABN Amro, Commerzbank and WestLB are managing the sale, which will be completed on Thursday.Textron, the US industrial conglomerate, sold €300m of eight-year bonds at 31bp above the mid-swap rate, to refinance its existing euro deal that matures this month. The order book grew beyond €600m.“The market har been starved of supply, so we see a lot more demand for these smaller-sized deals,” said Frazer Ross at Deutsche Bank, which managed the sale with JPMorgan.
