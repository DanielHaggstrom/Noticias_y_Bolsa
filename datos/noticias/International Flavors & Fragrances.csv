0;IFF;International Flavors & Fragrances;2019-12-16T19:11:08Z;IFF-DuPont $26bn deal bets on meatless future;US flavouring group seeks first-mover advantage with purchase of nutrition venture;A plant-based burger piled high with fixings is pictured in the investor slides for International Flavors & Fragrances’ $26.2bn deal to buy DuPont’s nutrition and biosciences business.The two companies would combine knowhow to serve the fast-growing meatless meat market, the presentation said. IFF offers features such as grill marks and antioxidants, while DuPont’s capabilities include the texturants that impart a beef-like mouth feel and the plant-based protein itself.The merger announced on Sunday reflects attempts across the food technology sector to follow consumers as they try out products they perceive to be more healthful, have fresher ingredients or leave a smaller environmental footprint. The rise of plant-based burgers epitomises the trend.“This is not about scale,” Andreas Fibig, IFF chief executive, told analysts on Monday. “This is about first-mover advantage to redefine our industry and deliver what our customers demand.”DuPont is a leading vendor of the cultures, enzymes, soya proteins and probiotics that underpin consumer food trends, according to Mr Fibig, while IFF’s edible offerings have been focused on taste, colour and food protection.The merged businesses would extend their wares beyond food vendors to also supply the pharmaceuticals and consumer products industries. Mr Fibig pointed to laundry detergent that could contain both DuPont’s enzymes for removing stains and IFF’s scents.Lauren Lieberman of Barclays said the DuPont business would give IFF access to more value-added, “tech-forward categories, in which it has little to no presence”.DuPont turned down bids from Kerry, the Irish food company, and Dutch chemicals company DSM, as it “ultimately believed that expanding their product offering was preferential to deepening their product offering,” said Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein.The combined company would have an enterprise value of $45.4bn and annual revenues of about $11bn. DuPont shareholders would own 55.4 per cent and IFF shareholders 44.6 per cent of the new company, which will be led by Mr Fibig.The tax-free deal will also include a $7.3bn cash payment to DuPont, which broke off from DowDuPont earlier this year. The nutrition and biosciences division to be sold has provided about 8 per cent of DuPont’s revenue.The tie-up marks the largest-ever acquisition in an industry that is increasingly consolidating.IFF last year bought Israel’s Frutarom Industries for $7.1bn including debt, elevating it into the world’s second-largest flavours and fragrances group. The addition of Frutarom expanded IFF’s footprint in high-growth markets such as natural colouring and health ingredients, according to Citigroup.Likewise, Geneva-based Givaudan pursued demand for organic ingredients when it acquired Naturex, a French maker of natural food and personal care components, for $1.6bn. Archer Daniels Midland, a US-based wholesale grain and oilseed processor, has ventured into the value-added flavour and ingredients markets with acquisitions including UK-based Probiotics International in 2018.IFF investors gave the deal a chilly reception, driving New York-based company’s shares down 7.8 per cent to $123.57 at midday. DuPont rose 0.5 per cent to $65.12.Analysts acknowledged the strategic rationale behind the deal but noted IFF investors’ concerns following the Frutarom takeover, which has not grown as investors had hoped.Had Kerry won the bidding it would have become the largest company on Dublin’s stock market.Jason Molins, head of food and beverage at Goodbody stockbrokers, said the failure to land the DuPont unit was a blow to Kerry, which now faces the prospect of two rivals merging to become the clear industry leader. Mr Molins, who said he believes Kerry had the financial firepower to buy the DuPont unit, said other potential deals of equivalent scale are unlikely to emerge soon.Kerry declined to discuss the DuPont bid, saying the company does not comment on speculation about deals. “As we have said previously, M&A plays an important part in our strategy and we will continue to investigate opportunities that can accelerate our growth and deliver significant shareholder value.”

But investors are turning their noses up at its latest deal, the $26.2bn purchase of DuPont’s nutrition unit. This is a pity. Like a piquant combination of spices, it should grow on them.IFF specialises in flavours and fragrances used in food, beverages and pharmaceuticals. DuPont’s N&B business is all about textures. Its products include soy proteins, probiotics and enzymes — ingredients used in fast-growing segments such as meat substitutes.This merger resembles yet another takeover by acquisitive IFF. Its CEO Andreas Fibig stays in charge. It creates a giant with an enterprise value of $45.4bn and annual revenues of $11bn. It will leapfrog Swiss rival Givaudan to become the industry leader.A Reverse Morris is involved. This is a tax gambit, not an English folk dance. Shareholders in the vendor end up with a majority stake in the acquirer.DuPont shareholders will own 55.4 per cent of the new company, in line with their unit’s contribution to earnings. Dupont will get a $7.3bn special cash payment, funded by new debt taken on by the new group. Less than half of this can be accounted a premium payment by IFF.The deal values DuPont’s N&B business at about 18 times ebitda. That is less than the 20.3 times IFF paid for Frutarom, but still no bargain. Fear that IFF may be overpaying explains an 8 per cent drop in its share price on Monday. Concern over the New York based group’s ability to digest another mega-deal so soon after the last one also weighed.Auctions stimulate overpayment via the fear of missing out. But the opportunity for IFF to broaden its reach beyond taste and smell may simply be too good to pass up.Big consumer goods companies are scrambling to meet rising consumer demand for natural ingredients. Subtle differences in eating pleasure — or the lack of it — can give one brand an advantage over another. IFF hopes buying N&B nutrition will strengthen its negotiating position with customers.The new company will have net debt of $10.5bn, or 4 times ebitda. This makes the deal hard to swallow for some. However projections of $300m in annual cost savings and $400m of revenue benefits — if realised — would go a long way to making it palatable.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

2;IFF;International Flavors & Fragrances;2019-12-15T22:33:49Z;IFF-DuPont deal creates $45bn flavourings giant;New York company wins bidding against Kerry for nutrition and biosciences unit;International Flavors & Fragrances agreed on Sunday to buy DuPont’s nutrition and biosciences business for $26.2bn, the latest acquisition by the New York company as it seeks to become a major supplier to the consumer goods industry.The deal will create a giant in the flavourings and nutrients industry, providing ingredients for products from vegan burgers to salad dressing to laundry detergent.The combined company will have an enterprise value, which includes debt, of $45.4bn, with annual revenues of about $11bn.IFF beat Ireland’s Kerry Group in the auction of the DuPont unit. The unit will be spun off and merged using a Reverse Morris Trust structure that means DuPont’s shareholders will not have to pay tax on the deal.Under the terms of the agreement, DuPont shareholders will own 55.4 per cent of the new combined company, while existing IFF shareholders will own the remainder. The company will be run by Andreas Fibig, IFF chief executive.If the transaction is approved, DuPont shareholders will also share in a $7.3bn special cash payment.The latest deal comes a year after IFF agreed to acquire Frutarom Industries, an Israeli flavour maker, for $7.1bn including debt, part of its plan to consolidate the food flavouring sector.The industry is dominated by four major companies — Givaudan, Firmenich, IFF and Symrise — which provide flavours and fragrances for use in food, beverages and pharmaceuticals.Sales have enjoyed steady growth in recent years as big consumer goods companies scramble to meet rising demand for natural, rather than artificial, scents and flavourings.“With highly complementary portfolios, we will have global scale and leading positions in key growth categories to capitalise on positive market trends, drive strong profitable growth for our shareholders and create opportunities for our employees,” Mr Fibig said.The enlarged group is targeting about $300m of cost savings within three years of the tie-up. The two companies have a combined headcount of more than 23,000 employees and more than 180 manufacturing sites.Ed Breen, chairman of DuPont, will become the lead independent director on a 13-person board, of which seven will be appointed by IFF and six by DuPont.The deal is the latest in a series of transactions involving DuPont. The old conglomerate merged in 2017 with Dow Chemical, but was split this year into three businesses. One retained the name DuPont, of which the nutrition and biosciences was part — until the deal announced on Sunday.Greenhill and Morgan Stanley were the financial advisers to IFF, while Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton gave it legal counsel. Credit Suisse and Evercore were advisers to DuPont and Skadden Arps gave it legal advice.
3;IFF;International Flavors & Fragrances;2018-05-07T18:10:46Z;Flavour-maker IFF buys rival Frutarom in $7bn deal;Changing consumer tastes are driving a rush of food industry deals;International Flavors & Fragrances, a manufacturer of ingredients for many of the world’s top food products, has acquired Israeli rival Frutarom Industries, highlighting how changing tastes are driving consolidation in the sector.IFF, whose shares have risen more than 41 per cent in the past four years, has a market value of $11bn. The New York-based company said on Monday the acquisition of Frutarom will transform it into a global leader in natural scent and flavouring and accelerate its exposure to small and midsized customers.The acquisition of Frutarom for $7.1bn including debt will help IFF gain new smaller health-conscious brands, which are enjoying higher margins than those controlled by consumer conglomerates such as Unilever and Kraft Heinz.IFF shares fell 9.6 per cent to $128.47 amid concerns that the company might be overpaying for the deal.At the heart of the deal is the need faced by most of the industry to catch up with consumers who increasingly demand natural — rather than artificial — scents and flavourings.“People are looking for more clean labels,” Andreas Fibig, IFF’s chairman and chief executive told the Financial Times. “The kind of brands that you’d find at Whole Foods.”The deal came on the day that snack giant Mondelez said it would pay $500m to acquire Tate’s Bake Shop, which makes its cookies with brown sugar and butter rather than corn syrup and vegetable oil.Consumer goods giants across the globe are battling to ignite sales as shoppers turn away from products that delighted previous generations, like cans of sugary cola and processed cookies.The deal will fold Tate’s cookies, brownies and pies, which are sold through upmarket stores like Whole Foods, into the Oreo empire of Mondelez. Tate’s “gives us an attractive entry point into the fast-growing premium cookie segment”, said Dirk Van de Put, Mondelez’s chief executive.The race to meet changing consumer tastes has fuelled a series of deals in the flavour and fragrance industry — which is dominated by IFF, Givaudan, Firmenich and Symrise — as the incumbents look to acquire smaller, millennial-friendly brands.Geneva-based Givaudan, a top flavours and fragrances maker, recently acquired French natural ingredients group Naturex for $1.6bn.Analysts say F&F companies are indispensable to the consumer goods industry and can therefore command a premium for their products, as subtle differences in flavours are often the reason why consumers prefer one brand over another.Under the terms of the deal Frutarom’s shareholders will receive $71.19 in cash and 0.249 of a share of IFF common stock for each of their shares. The offer values Frutarom at $106.25 per share — an 11 per cent premium to the Israeli group’s closing price on Sunday.Frutarom, which sells over 70,000 products to more than 30,000 customers in over 150 countries, said it expects to take in more than $1.6bn in sales this year and aims to hit $2.25bn in sales by 2020.
4;IFF;International Flavors & Fragrances;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;A whole lotta flavour: IFF strikes $7.1bn deal for Israel’s Frutarom;;"A savoury deal all around.

International Flavors & Fragrances on Monday agreed to acquire Israeli flavour maker Frutarom Industries for $7.1bn including debt, in the latest deal to be struck in the fast consolidating food flavouring sector.Under the terms of the deal, Frutarom’s shareholders will receive $71.19 in cash and 0.249 of a share of IFF common stock for each of their shares. The offer values Frutarom at $106.25 per share - or an 11 per cent premium to the Israeli group’s closing price on Sunday.The deal comes just two months after Geneva-based Givaudan said it would buy French natural ingredients group Naturex for $1.6bn and underscores how the flavours and fragrances (F&F) industry is quickly becoming a hotbed for dealmakings.The sector has enjoyed steady sales growth in recent years as big consumer goods companies scramble to meet rising consumer demand for natural - rather than artificial - scents and flavourings.The industry is dominated by four major companies - Givaudan, Firmenich, IFF, and Symrise - which provide flavours and fragrances for use in food, beverages and pharmaceuticals. As subtle differences in flavours are often the reason why consumers prefer and remain loyal to one brand over another, analysts say F&F companies are indispensible to the consumer goods industry and as such can command high premiums for their products.IFF, which has seen its shares rise by over 41 per cent over the past four years, has a market value of $11bn. The New York-based company said on Monday the acquisition of Frutarom will transform it into a global leader in natural scent and flavouring and accelerate its exposure to small and mid sized customers.“This transaction is a big win and a fantastic outcome for shareholders, customers and employees of both companies,” said Andreas Fibig, IFF’s chairman and chief executive. “Frutarom has an extremely attractive product portfolio, including broad expertise in naturals and diverse adjacencies with capabilities beyond our core taste and scent businesses. It also has significant exposure to complementary and fast-growing small- and mid-sized customers.”Frutarom, which sells over 70,000 products to more than 30,000 customers in over 150 countries, said it expect to take in over $1.6bn in sales this year and aims to hit $2.25bn in sales by 2020.(Photo: Getty Images)"
5;IFF;International Flavors & Fragrances;2011-01-10T23:59:17Z;DuPont to buy Danisco for $5.8bn;;DuPont of the US has agreed to buy Danisco of Denmark in a $5.8bn recommended deal that strengthens its presence in the food ingredient and enzyme markets.The acquisition reflects a push by DuPont to increase its exposure to the food and nutrition industry amid rising global demand, particularly from emerging markets. Danisco makes additives such as sweeteners and emulsifiers for a range of foods, drinks and animal feeds as well as enzymes for detergents and industrial processes.The deal also represents a bet by DuPont on the use of enzymes to make fuels and plastics from agricultural waste.Copenhagen-based Danisco already has a joint venture with DuPont focused on developing enzymes for advanced “second generation” cellulosic ethanol, which it hopes to bring into commercial production about 2013.Ellen Kullman, DuPont chief executive, said that by addressing growing demand for food and clean energy, the acquisition would sharpen the group’s focus on two of the biggest socio­economic challenges facing the world.“Biotechnology and speciality food ingredients have the potential to change the landscape of industries, such as substituting renewable materials for fossil fuels and addressing food needs in developing economies,” she said.The deal would be the biggest for DuPont since its $7.7bn acquisition of Pioneer, the seed producer, in 1999.Danisco said its board unanimously recommended the DKr665-a-share cash offer, which represented a 25 per cent premium over Friday’s closing price. The stock closed at DKr657 on Monday, suggesting investors saw little likelihood of a higher offer.Jorgen Tandrup, Danisco chairman, said the company had contacted other potential bidders but none would match DuPont’s offer, which amounted to 12.8 times last year’s earnings before interest, tax and depreciation.Shares in DuPont closed down 1.5 per cent after it said the acquisition would reduce earnings this year, although it argued that revenue growth and the end of one-off acquisition costs meant the deal would enhance earnings in 2012.Analysts said the biggest potential upside came from Danisco’s expertise in making enzymes for the ethanol industry.Danisco has been at the forefront of efforts to produce cellulosic ethanol, which is seen as superior to conventional corn-based ethanol because it competes less with food supplies, but has been bedevilled by technical difficulties.DuPont will assume $500m of Danisco debt and finance the deal with $3bn of cash and the remainder in new debt. Danisco was advised by Deutsche Bank.
6;IFF;International Flavors & Fragrances;2008-04-17T20:47:45Z;Wall Street rebound lead by financials;;In a muted session of trading US stock markets went sideways on Thursday as investors weighed a mixed batch of earnings reports and an unlikely rally in the downtrodden financial and consumer discretionary sectors offset losses in healthcare and industrials.Highlighting the ambivalence of much of the day’s earnings news were industrial conglomerates including United Technologies Corp, Danaher and Textron. The trio posted estimate-beating first-quarter profits but cautious outlook statements from UTC and Danaher dented the stocks.UTC fell 2.5 per cent to $70.79, Danaher lost 3.5 per cent to $74.16 and Textron dropped 2.8 per cent to $60.44, dragging the S&P industrials sector down 0.8 per cent.Pfizer also stumbled. The shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $20.40 after the drugmaker said first-quarter profits fell as generic medicines cut into its sales.The news hit competitors Eli Lilly and Merck, which fell 2.2 per cent to $51.39 and 2.7 per cent to $39.22 respectively, knocking 0.8 per cent off the healthcare sector.Meanwhile, a pessimistic outlook statement from Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone company, hurt US rival Motorola, whose shares slid 1.6 per cent to $9.05.By the close, however, a rally in financials helped markets limp into positive territory for a third day in a row. The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the day 0.1 per cent ahead at 1,365.54.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 2,341.83 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly flat for the day at 12,620.16.Positive earnings news from IBM overnight and Google after the close on Thursday which both beat expectations, helped extend a rally in technology stocks that began on Wednesday when bellwether Intel released strong results and forecasts.IBM climbed 2.2 per cent to $123.08. Google said first-quarter profits jumped 30 per cent as expansion abroad more than compensated for a slowdown in advertising spending in the US. Google shares surged 11.8 per cent to $502.66 in after-hours trade.There were other bright spots on Thursday. Trading in the financial sector began in desultory fashion after Merrill Lynch reported its third quarterly loss in a row on $6.5bn of writedowns and said it would slash jobs to reduce costs.But that was broadly in-line with expectations and, by the close, investors had shrugged off the bad news sending Merrill shares, which have lost about half their value in the past year, up 4.1 per cent to $46.71.Its peers, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley, rose 4.6 per cent to $43.64 and 2.2 per cent to $46.42 respectively, while the S&P Financials index gained 1.4 per cent.MGIC, the biggest US mortgage insurer, soared 19 per cent to $12.49 after it lost less money in the first quarter than expected. Be-leagured bond insurers Ambac and MBIA also made ground, adding 8.7 per cent to $5.76 and 9.1 per cent to $12.71 respectively.Supervalu, the second-biggest US supermarket chain, gained 5.3 per cent to $30.60 after it said fourth-quarter profit rose more than analysts had estimated.Leggett & Platt led the consumer discretionary sector 0.4 per cent higher. Shares in the maker of supports for car seats jumped 14.6 per cent to $16.45 on an analyst upgrade.So far this year, the S&P 500 has fallen about 7 per cent as investors worry that a slowing US economy will begin to dent corporate profits. Analysts predict that first-quarter earnings will drop 12.3 per cent in total – a number many see as still too optimistic.For the most part investors skipped past a series of economic reports released on Thursday morning that added depressing details – rising unemployment and a slump in manufacturing activity – to the picture, of stagnation in the US.Materials stocks were also in focus on Thursday. Citigroup cut US Steel from “buy” to “hold”, knocking the shares 0.4 per cent to $154.78.JPMorgan cut International Flavors & Fragrances from “neutral” to “underweight”, sending the shares down 3.2 per cent to $44.65.Wednesday’s biggest gainers also fell. Monsanto, the agricultural group, retreated from its record high, dropping 3.2 per cent to $127.34.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gave up 0.5 per cent to $112.66.
