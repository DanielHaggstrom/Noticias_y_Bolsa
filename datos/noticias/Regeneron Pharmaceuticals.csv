The trial will start at New York hospitals but be expanded to 16 sites. It is expected to enrol up to 400 critically ill coronavirus patients, studying the drug’s impact on their fever and need for extra oxygen. It will also look at whether it prevents deaths or even hospitalisation. Many pharmaceutical companies have started trials based on existing drugs, which have proven they are safe to take, to see if they are effective at treating Covid-19.The drugs fall into three broad categories: antibodies taken and adapted from people who have recovered from the virus and used for infusions for the sickest patients; antivirals, such as drugs designed for HIV, Ebola, and malaria, which could stop the replication of the virus in the earlier stages; and antinflammatories, such as Kevzara, for treating immune system reactions like the one that occurs in the later stage of the disease.A study in China of favipiravir, an antiviral developed by the Japanese Fujifilm group, is due out soon, while the first results from a study into remdesivir, an antiviral originally developed by California-based Gilead for Ebola, is expected in mid-April. Kevzara is an antibody but was not designed for Covid-19. Christos Kyratsous, vice-president of research in infectious diseases at Regeneron, said the drug may be able to provide some “temporary support”, especially in countries where the healthcare systems are overloaded. How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereHe said anecdotal evidence from studying similar antibodies in China made him optimistic, “but we believe that it needs to be tested in the clinical setting to make sure the data we are getting is unbiased”, he said. John Reed, Sanofi’s global head of research and development, said Kevzara could be a potentially important treatment option across the world. “We expect to rapidly initiate trials outside the US. in the coming weeks, including areas most affected by the pandemic such as Italy.”Sanofi and Regeneron are working on efforts to develop a vaccine to Covid-19. Regeneron is prepared to scale up manufacturing if the trial shows Kevzara is effective, Mr Kyratsous said, with facilities in Alberta, New York and Ireland.

The latest sell-off extended the benchmark index’s decline this week to more than 8 per cent, which would mark its steepest drop since the financial crisis.Only five companies have managed to post a week-to-date gain by Thursday afternoon.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has been the top performer with a 10.4 per cent rise, as the company races to develop treatments for coronavirus. In early February, Regeneron said it was expanding a partnership with the US Department of Health and Human Services and treatments could be made available for testing or “compassionate use” within a few months.Shares in Gilead, whose antiviral drug remdesivir is the subject of a clinical trial for the treatment of Covid-19, have jumped 5.9 per cent.Clorox, known for its disinfecting wipes and other cleaning products, and CME Group are each up more than 3 per cent.Netflix is another unsurprising member of the winners’ circle, with the streaming video giant positioned to remain a fixture on consumers’ screens if offices or schools are forced to close. Shares are up 0.8 per cent this week and about 18 per cent year-to-date.Although they are down for the week, Steris and Quest Diagnostics have notably outperformed the broader market. Steris, which makes sterilisation equipment and other products for medical providers, is down just 0.6 per cent. Quest, a clinical lab, has fallen by the same margin.The utilities sector, considered a defensive play in equities, has recorded the slimmest decline this week at minus 7 per cent. Consumer staples, healthcare and real estate have outperformed the benchmark S&P 500, while energy has registered the steepest decline at 15 per cent.
2;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2019-02-11T17:24:55Z;Sanofi and Regeneron cut price of Praluent by 60%;Drugmakers lower cost of anti-cholesterol drug amid slow take-up and political pressure;Sanofi and Regeneron are slashing the list price of anti-cholesterol drug Praluent by 60 per cent, as the drugmakers respond to pressure from US health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers reluctant to adopt the costly medicine.Praluent will have a list price of $5,850 a year from early March, down from about $14,000 previously. The price cut is designed to make the drug more affordable for older patients using Medicare, cutting out-of-pocket costs to between $25 and $150 a month, depending on the plan.Drugmakers had hoped that injections for people with dangerously high cholesterol would become blockbuster drugs. But Praluent, and its rival Repatha, had struggled to gain traction in a market dominated by statins that can cost less than $50 a year.A 2017 study in the journal Circulation claimed that even for patients with a severe hereditary form of high cholesterol, insurers rejected the drugs 63 per cent of the time. Pharmaceutical companies have faced vocal criticism for high drug prices from both sides of the political divide in the US. Several politicians are floating proposals for government intervention on drug pricing and the Food and Drug Administration, the US regulator, is speeding up approvals of cheaper generics versions of drugs that are no longer under patent. The price cut follows a similarly dramatic discount by Amgen of its anti-cholesterol drug Repatha in October. Praluent now has the same list price as Repatha. French drugmaker Sanofi and Regeneron had already cut the net price for a significant proportion of patients covered by Express Scripts, the largest standalone pharmacy benefit manager in the US. Leonard S Schleifer, president and chief executive at Regeneron, said the cut should help senior citizens who had still found it hard to afford the medicines because of high co-pay costs. “Offering a lower-priced Praluent will help lower seniors’ out-of-pocket costs and thereby remove another barrier to receiving this important medicine,” he said. Michelle Carnahan, North America head of primary care at Sanofi, called on insurers to pass on the price cut to patients. “We hope that payers will do their part to help ensure savings are directly passed on to more patients, through lower out-of-pocket costs,” she said. Praluent was approved by the FDA in 2015 and was the first drug of its kind — called a PCSK9 inhibitor — to receive approval. The drug promotes the body’s ability to remove cholesterol from its own system, and is particularly useful for patients with a severe hereditary form of high cholesterol.
3;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2018-05-01T11:00:27Z;Sanofi slashes price of wannabe-blockbuster cholesterol drug;Sales of Praluent have been hurt by the campaign to limit US pharmaceuticals costs;Sanofi and Regeneron have agreed to slash the price of a novel cholesterol-lowering drug, in an attempt to boost flagging sales of what investors had hoped would be a blockbuster new medicine.The discounts on the US price of Praluent — an injection for people with dangerously high cholesterol who need something more powerful than the cheap statins taken by millions of Americans — are a further sign that pharmaceutical companies are losing their pricing power.Sanofi said it would lower the net price of Praluent for a significant proportion of patients covered by Express Scripts, the largest standalone pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) in the US. Praluent, which was launched in 2015, is part of a new class of cholesterol drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, which Sanofi developed in tandem with New York-based biotech Regeneron, its longstanding partner.In exchange, Express Scripts will make it easier for patients to receive the medicine by removing barriers that have been put in place to limit uptake of the expensive drug.The French drugmaker did not disclose the discounted price, but one person briefed on the negotiations said it would be in the range of $4,500-$8,000 per year — a significant reduction of at least 45 per cent on the medicine’s list price of $14,500.Analysts had predicted blockbuster sales for PCSK9 inhibitors, with peak revenues of up to $6bn a year, which would have put them among the best-selling classes of drugs of all time.But health insurers and PBMs balked at the high price tag — which compares to less than $50 for an annual supply of statins — and refused to pay for the medicines unless doctors and patients completed a laborious “prior authorisation” process involving lots of paperwork.Implementing a prior authorisation process for expensive medicines has become a favourite tool of insurers and PBMs seeking to control costs, and it has had a chilling effect on sales of some drugs.Last year, Praluent generated just $195m in sales for Sanofi and Regeneron, and Repatha, a rival drug made by biotech company Amgen, brought in $319m — putting both medicines well short of analysts’ revenue forecasts. Amgen said last year that three-quarters of prescriptions for Repatha in the US were being rejected for reimbursement.The deep discounting announced by Sanofi on Tuesday provides further evidence that insurance companies and PBMs are having some success at holding down drug prices in the US after years of budget-busting increases. A report published last week found that net spending on medicines grew by just 0.6 per cent in 2017, the lowest level of inflation recorded in years.The deal could also boost Praluent’s market share, which has lagged behind Repatha. Express Scripts will make Sanofi the exclusive provider of PCSK9 therapies for 25m patients on its national preferred formulary, and will simplify the prior authorisation process. Doctors prescribing Praluent will have to fill in a single “attestation” form rather than submitting laboratory results and detailed patient histories.Michelle Carnahan, who runs Sanofi’s diabetes and cardiovascular business in the US, said the deal “addressed head-on the frustrations caused by complex pre-authorisation requirements that can hamstring physicians and restrict access to an important medicine”.

The appeal court also reversed a decision that banned the companies from selling their medicine, known as Praluent.Shares in Amgen fell 1.6 per cent as investors digested the news that the company’s drug, Repatha, would not have the market to itself. Sanofi’s Paris-listed stock edged up by 0.6 per cent.Analysts had touted the new cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, as an alternative to the statins taken by millions of people to prevent heart attacks and strokes, which would have made them one of the most lucrative classes of medicines in years.But sales of the medicines have been sluggish since they were launched at the end of 2015, as healthcare systems and insurers have balked at the pricetag — $14,000 a year versus just a few cents a day for generic statins.
5;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2017-07-02T17:34:11Z;Fears over a medical gold rush in cancer drug race;With almost 800 trials under way observers warn scientific rigour is being compromised;It might sound like a strange complaint against an industry often accused of scrimping on research to fund marketing efforts, but some executives and scientists say drugmakers are doing too many clinical trials in the hot new field of immunotherapy.Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb have dominated the first wave of immunotherapy with their “checkpoint inhibitors”, which release brakes in the immune system so that it can attack tumours, while Roche, AstraZeneca and Pfizer are trying to catch up by launching rival versions. Almost $9bn worth of these checkpoints have been sold since they went on sale two years ago. Early enthusiasm for the medicines has given way to a determination to push response rates substantially higher. Although a minority of about 20 to 30 per cent of patients respond extremely well to the drugs — living for months or years longer than their doctors would expect — the majority derive no benefit. “There is some pushback,” said Jill O'Donnell-Tormey, chief executive of the Cancer Research Institute. “Are there too many trials? Are we just throwing spaghetti at the wall, by taking compound ‘X’ or ‘Y’ and adding it together just to see what happens?” Most scientists say checkpoints do not need to be replaced with something else, but rather augmented with new drugs that can further cajole the immune system into fighting cancer. This has led to an unprecedented amount of clinical research sponsored by drugmakers, which are combining checkpoints with other medicines to try to find a magic bullet to treat cancer. The sheer number of studies has sparked fears that some companies are engaging in a medical gold rush, hoping to chance upon the right cocktail without doing the appropriate scientific groundwork. Almost 800 clinical trials involving a checkpoint are under way in the US, according to a government database, more than 700 of which are testing the drugs in combination with one or more additional medicines. This compares with about 200 in 2015.Some investors are unnerved by such haste, says Brad Loncar, who runs an exchange-traded fund focused on immunotherapy: “People are concerned there is not as much scientific rigour as there should be.” The world doesn’t need any more [checkpoints]. We need other things. We should be finding a way to develop other medicines beyond thesePascal Soriot, chief executive AstraZeneca, which is trialling its own immunotherapy combination, admitted as much in a recent interview with the Financial Times. “The field is very competitive. Right now you have a lot of companies that take bets . . . without a lot of data,” he said. “So we also have to consider the speed, and sometimes we’re going to have to take educated risks with maybe not as much conviction or data to support the clinical programme, but enough of it.” While Mr Loncar believes that the recent surge in clinical trials is fundamentally a good thing for patients, he says the field should move at a speed that allows scientists to fully understand the reasons behind a particular success or failure. “When trials fail there’s not enough time or effort to look at the details to understand why things are not working,” he says. With five checkpoints on the market, the class of medicines is well-established, but many drugmakers are nonetheless developing their own versions, such as Novartis, Eli Lilly and Regeneron. In total, there are roughly 50 of these medicines, pejoratively known as “me too” products, in the pipeline. Some executives say the latecomers may find it increasingly difficult to fill their trials with “naive” patients who have not already been treated with a checkpoint. Many will have taken the drugs already, either because they have completed one of the hundreds of existing studies, or because their doctor has prescribed the medicine to them on an “off-label” basis, whereby they are given an immunotherapy to treat a cancer for which it is not approved.“The level of pre-treatment and controlling for that is something we want to be cognisant of, because we want to ensure we have a consistent set of baseline patients to evaluate,” says Vas Narasimhan, global head of drug development at Novartis. “And I would say that’s getting more complex.” Theoretically, it should not be difficult to recruit participants given that only 4 per cent of cancer patients end up on a trial in the US. But the pharma industry has struggled to widen the pool beyond highly educated people who live in urban centres. Patients can also be reluctant to enter a randomised trial because they might end up in the control group that does not receive the drug, a fear that some companies have tried to assuage by allowing people to cross over into the treatment arm once their cancer worsens. Designing trials in this way can cloud the results significantly, however. Dr Roger Perlmutter, the top scientist at Merck, has little sympathy for laggard companies, arguing they should instead focus their efforts on unearthing new drugs or looking for biological clues that might predict which patients are most likely to respond. “It’s going to be difficult for those who are coming in late, but really that’s the way it should be,” he says. “The world doesn’t need any more [checkpoints]. We need other things. We should be finding a way to develop other medicines beyond these.” And some investors fear that the proliferation of checkpoints could end up commoditising one of the most promising drug classes in years. The rush to develop so many “me-too” drugs is best explained by the widely held belief that checkpoints will form the backbone of combination immunotherapies in the future. Those companies without their own in-house versions will have to strike deals with a rival company every time they discover a promising molecule that might be used in a cocktail, reducing their flexibility and wasting time in a highly competitive field. “We fully recognise there are others out there, but we decided to develop our own because we felt it was a necessary ingredient,” says Dr Israel Lowy, a vice-president at Regeneron. “We wanted the flexibility to trial it in combinations.” He adds: “There is a lot of room to improve if we do come up with the right combination. That’s the future. We are only at chapter one in the book of immunotherapy.” There is a huge excitement about the promise of experimental combination immunotherapies, which contain two or more medicines designed to encourage the immune system to attack cancer. Several companies unveiled encouraging early data on such cocktails last month at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the world’s largest gathering of cancer experts. Merck presented favourable results from a small trial combining its immunotherapy, Keytruda, with a drug made by biotech group Incyte: 35 per cent of patients with a certain type of lung cancer responded when given both drugs, about double the rate that doctors would expect if they were taking Keytruda alone. And Bristol-Myers unveiled early data that suggested a new cocktail containing a medicine known as “Lag 3” could help melanoma patients who have already tried an immunotherapy but failed to respond. However, with the price of a single immunotherapy already running at $150,000 per patient each year, many fear that cash-strapped healthcare systems will be unable to bear the cost of treatment regimens that combine two or more drugs. “The individual drugs are very expensive and the system won’t bear adding one on top of another,” says Brad Loncar, founder of an exchange-traded fund focused on immunotherapy. “The combo itself will have to be marketed as a single thing,” he adds, predicting that drugmakers will offer significant discounts for patients who end up taking a cocktail containing several medicines. Mr Loncar predicts that such cost pressures will lead to further consolidation in the immunotherapy field, as companies try to ensure they own all the ingredients in a cocktail so that they can set the price. “The only way to offer these discounts is if you own every component of the combination yourself,” he adds.

Robert Koch identified TB in 1882. It’s been almost 25 years since the World Health Organization called TB an emergency. We still don’t have the tools: we have no vaccine, and treatment and diagnosis for many is unchanged. If Koch woke up from his grave, he would feel very familiar in the laboratory. It’s a failure of humanity — the bug is outsmarting us all.Why are we failing to achieve more?
Everyone is trying very hard but there is something that doesn’t click. I think things will come together in the next 2 or 3 years. We are not using the most advanced tools and not making sure everything is monitored. It’s a failure of the system if we are unable to detect, diagnose or put on treatment for those with TB. It’s a waste of life, of hope. After all these efforts, we are not even detecting half of multi-drug resistant TB.What needs to change?
Unless we have the proper tools — new drugs and diagnostics — we won’t go anywhere. We need to empower people in the community to have a massive scale-up of treatment. We don’t have disaggregated information and we are still working on paper to collect statistics, while news is circulating instantaneously. We need to move out of the Stone Age.

The facility has received £200m funding from the UK government and medical charities.“UK Biobank has amassed an enormous amount of securely stored health, lifestyle, medical and biological data,” said Sir Rory Collins, Biobank’s leader. “This exciting initiative is expected to start producing novel findings rapidly during this year.”Drug companies are keen to gather human genetic evidence to make their product development more efficient, said Sir Rory. An estimated 90 per cent of potential medicines entering clinical trials turn out not to be effective and safe enough to reach the market; they usually fail through an incomplete understanding of the link between a drug’s biological target and human disease, which genetic evidence can provide.GSK, the largest UK pharma company, and Regeneron, a big US biotech, have jointly made an initial investment of about £12m for the first phase of the DNA project, which will sequence 50,000 samples this year at the Regeneron Genetics Centre in New York’s Hudson Valley, one of the world’s largest genome sequencing laboratories.In accordance with Biobank’s founding principles, designed to give industry an incentive to use the resource while preserving public access, the two companies will have exclusive use of the DNA data for a relatively short period — nine months — after which they will be made available to the wider scientific community.The essential guide for decision makers in health — straight to your inbox every FridayThe project will begin by sequencing each person’s “exome” — the genes that code directly for proteins, the main working molecules of biology. Later it may move on to whole genome sequencing, reading the full complement of DNA inside the nucleus of every human cell, which includes key regions that control the activity of genes.George Yancopoulos, chief scientist at Regeneron, described Biobank as a “fabulous opportunity”. He said the structure of the NHS, with which the resource is closely integrated, would give the UK programme an edge over similar efforts in the US and elsewhere, because genetic data can be matched more easily with updated patient records. In contrast, patient records in the US are scattered across different insurance companies and public health plans, and they move around as patients switch from one provider to another.Patrick Vallance, president of R&D at GSK, said the Biobank initiative “demonstrates how important the UK is as a centre for innovative research”.Companies throughout the pharmaceutical industry are scrambling to tie up access deals to genomic data. Last year, for example, AstraZeneca announced a collaboration with Human Longevity Inc, the US company run by genomics pioneer Craig Venter, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge.Additional reporting by David Crow in New York"
8;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2017-03-12T13:00:48Z;Eczema drug from Regeneron tipped for blockbuster status;Analysts predict first medicine for skin illness will make $6bn in annual sales;When Morgan Burns’ severe eczema cleared up at the age of 13, he thought he had been handed a reprieve from the painful condition that plagued his childhood.“But in law school it came back with a vengeance and it was all over the place — my hands, elbows, feet, knees, back,” recalls Mr Burns, 47. “No part of my body was spared.”He embarked on an unsuccessful “20-year quest” to treat his cracked and bloody skin, until one day he secured a place on a trial of a new drug discovered by Regeneron, the New York-based biotech company. The medicine, Dupixent, changed his life.“Over the next six to eight weeks, there was a continuous improvement until one day my skin was basically clear,” says Mr Burns, a lawyer, who has been injecting himself with the drug each week for the past 14 months.The US Food and Drug Administration is due to decide whether to approve the new medicine for moderate to severe eczema, or atopic dermatitis, this month, and analysts are predicting blockbuster sales for Regeneron and its commercial partner, French drugmaker Sanofi.If Dupixent is given a green light, it is expected to be the most lucrative drug launch of the year, with annual revenues of $4.6bn by 2022, according to EvaluatePharma, the research group.There are no approved medicines for moderate or severe atopic dermatitis, which affects 8.5m adults in the US and EU, so patients must make do with steroid creams and other, sometimes questionable, treatments.Adnan Butt, analyst at RBC, is forecasting peak annual sales of up to $6bn, a figure predicated on a price tag of roughly $25,000 per patient per year for Dupixent, which patients will probably have to take for life. He says the dearth of options for patients will make it easier for Regeneron and Sanofi to charge such a price.But some physicians think insurers and pharmacy benefit managers — often referred to as “payers” — could demand steep discounts, or require doctors and patients to jump through several hoops before agreeing to reimburse the drug.“Payers have their antenna up and . . . they will be aggressive in containing utilisation,” says Dr Peter Bach, a pricing expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. He points to the difficulty that Amgen, Regeneron and Sanofi have had securing reimbursement for their new cholesterol-lowering drugs, and similar problems for Novartis’ recently launched heart medicine.Faced with the economics of an older and sicker population, US payers have increasingly been driving a harder bargain with drugmakers. They have been emboldened by the public outcry over egregiously priced medicines such as the $10,000 acne cream and the $750 Aids pill.Analysts say the launch of Dupixent will be a test of whether drugmakers can convince buyers to foot the bill for new medicines with premium prices. In a sign of the importance of the negotiations, Leonard Schleifer, Regeneron’s chief executive, has handled them personally.“There is no competition, so from a market perspective we would be free to price the drug at a very robust price,” says Dr Schleifer. “But I feel that we should be responsible, and price the drug responsibly.”In return, he says, he wants payers to agree to a “grand bargain” where they will reimburse the medicine for patients who need it.“I’m very optimistic that this formula of working together with a breakthrough product but being responsible in pricing will lead payers to be equally appropriate on how they make the drug accessible,” he says.Regeneron says there are roughly 300,000 patients in the US who do not have their atopic dermatitis under control, but some analysts think the number could be as high as 500,000.Before trying Dupixent, Mr Burns attempted lots of treatments, including standing in a sunbed-style lightbox and slathering himself with vegetable oil once a day. “It sort of helps until you realise all your clothes are stained,” he says.In the most serious cases, doctors use toxic drugs that suppress the immune system such as cyclosporine, which is used in organ transplant patients, and methotrexate, more commonly associated with cancer treatment. Neither medicine has been endorsed by regulators, meaning physicians use them “off label”.“All of them increase the risk of infections and [cancer] down the road, so they are associated with some pretty heavy baggage,” says Dr Jonathan Silverberg, a dermatologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago who conducted trials of Dupixent.By targeting a biological pathway that triggers atopic dermatitis, Dupixent can control the condition without suppressing other parts of the immune system, meaning it is much safer than drugs such as cyclosporine.“[Dupixent] is able to target very specifically this inflammation without the collateral damage of hitting other parts of the immune system that are needed to fight off infections,” says Dr Silverberg.During late-stage clinical trials, around two-thirds of patients taking Dupixent with a steroid cream saw a dramatic improvement in their eczema, while nearly 40 per cent achieved clear or almost clear skin. Participants also reported a marked reduction in itching, the number one complaint among sufferers of atopic dermatitis.We do not want Dupixent to be used for millions of patients who don’t really need it. We want it to be used for the thousands of patients that really need itThe pathway targeted by Dupixent is also thought to cause several other allergic conditions, and Regeneron is trialling the medicine in people with asthma, nasal polyps, food allergies, as well as children with atopic dermatitis.Mr Butt describes the product as a “pipeline within a drug”, and compares it to anti-inflammatory agents such as AbbVie’s Humira and Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade. The medicines were first approved for arthritis but went on to become the world’s top-selling drugs after being proven to work in a wide range of illnesses, generating a combined $23bn in sales last year.The essential guide for decision makers in health — straight to your inbox every FridayMany atopic dermatitis patients also suffer from asthma and other allergic illnesses, and Regeneron and Sanofi are hoping that Dupixent could help control two or more conditions. That would allow the companies to make a “two-for-the-price-of-one” argument when negotiating with cash-strapped healthcare systems.“If you have one molecule that does two things you essentially have a cost-effective way of doing combination therapies,” says Elias Zerhouni, president of global research and development at Sanofi, likening the approach to “sending a missile with multiple warheads”.Dr Zerhouni stresses that the drug is intended to be used only in patients for whom there is no effective treatment. “We do not want Dupixent to be used for millions of patients who don’t really need it. We want it to be used for the thousands of patients that really need it.”

Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
10;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2017-01-12T16:56:01Z;Sanofi confident it can overturn Praluent patent ruling;French drugmaker faces questions over how to offset declining Lantus revenues;Under pressure to deliver a new blockbuster medicine, Sanofi, France’s biggest drugmaker, bet big on a new class of cholesterol-lowering products with its Praluent treatment.Last week it was dealt a harsh blow after the drug was ordered off US shelves in a patent dispute with rival Amgen. Now Olivier Brandicourt, Sanofi’s chief executive, is facing questions over how he can plug the revenue gap left by the sure and steady decline in sales of its best-selling insulin medicine, Lantus.Mr Brandicourt is confident that the injunction announced last week can be overturned. He also argues it is in the “public interest” that Praluent remains on the market and questions Amgen’s approach to the litigation given the risk of uncertainty for the 18,000 US patients taking the drug.District Judge Sue Robinson ruled that Sanofi and Regeneron, which helped develop Praluent, were infringing patents held by Amgen, which makes a competing drug, Repatha. Sanofi and its US partner were given 30 days to stop selling Praluent in the US, although this was extended to 45 days in a hearing this week.Both drugmakers are appealing against the decision and Mr Brandicourt says they have a “fair chance of winning”.“The judge herself may not have given the full scope of what we wanted to bring to the party and to the jury members, and in our defence I feel we have been a little short changed,” Mr Brandicourt told the Financial Times at the JPMorgan healthcare conference in San Francisco this week.In a market where US president-elect Donald Trump has said pharmaceutical companies are “getting away with murder” over pricing, Mr Brandicourt will find it even harder to make up lost revenue if Sanofi and Regeneron lose their appeal.Analysts at Bernstein had expected Praluent revenues to reach $2.3bn by 2025, making it Sanofi’s biggest medicine by sales.Mr Brandicourt says that withdrawing Praluent from the US is akin to having allowed a single statin to have a monopoly when the drugs were first used in the 1980s, as he says Amgen’s Repatha will be the only drug of its class available in the US.The market for PCSK9 inhibitors could be worth up to $6bn a year at peak, according to analysts. The medicines block a type of protein that reduces the liver’s ability to release LDL or “bad” cholesterol, which is identified as a major cause of heart disease.While it is estimated that as many as a third of US adults take statins, roughly a fifth do not respond well to the treatment and continue to register high levels of cholesterol.Insurers in the US have been reluctant to pay for PCSK9 inhibitors since their launch in 2015, after balking at a price tag as high as $14,000 a year versus a few cents a day for statins.Analysts say, however, that insurers will have to drastically expand access to the medicines if soon-to-be-published research shows they reduce heart attacks and strokes, rather than simply lower cholesterol.Amgen executives told investors in San Francisco this week that about three-quarters of prescriptions for its Repatha were being rejected by insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The company says it will net about $250m of sales from Repatha in 2016, but the drug would have generated $1bn in revenues if all prescriptions were authorised.Without the potential windfall from Praluent, Mr Brandicourt could struggle to offset declining revenues from Lantus, which had sales of more than $6bn in 2015, and which is being is being challenged by a cheaper “biosimilar” alternative made by Eli Lilly.However, Lantus is a biologic drug harvested from living cells — meaning it is not possible for a generic manufacturer to produce a carbon copy as they can with a pill — so rivals must instead produce a “biosimilar” version that has the same effect. But being relatively new, biosimilars are being used with caution, resulting in a less rapid switch from branded medicines.Mr Brandicourt says Lantus is not facing a “patent cliff”, but rather a long and gradual decline that he describes as a “patent hill”. Goldman Sachs estimates sales will fall to roughly $2.9bn a year in 2020.
11;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2017-01-06T16:47:37Z;Regeneron shares tumble as US court blocks cholesterol drug;Judge says Praluent infringes on patents held by Amgen covering rival treatment;Investors wiped more than $2bn from the market value of Regeneron, the New York-based biotech group, after a court took the highly unusual step of permanently blocking the company from selling its cholesterol-lowering medicine in the US.Regeneron and its commercial partner Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals group, were ordered to pull their medicine, Praluent, from the market within 30 days by a US district judge, who ruled the drugmakers were infringing on patents held by Amgen.Patent disputes are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, but analysts said it was virtually unprecedented for a court to block sales of an existing medicine that was already being prescribed to thousands of patients a week.Analysts have touted the new cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, as an alternative to the statins taken by millions of people to prevent heart attacks and strokes, which would make them one of the most lucrative classes of medicines in years.Sales of the drugs have been sluggish since they were launched at the end of 2015, as healthcare systems and insurers have balked at the pricetag — $14,000 a year versus just a few cents a day for generic statins.But analysts expect US sales of the cholesterol-lowering drugs to surge to about $6bn a year if soon-to-be-published clinical trials show they can reduce the chances of patients suffering a deadly cardiovascular event.Shares in Regeneron fell 6.5 per cent in early trading in New York, while Sanofi’s Paris-listed stock was down 2.7 per cent. Amgen, which makes the only rival drug, Repatha, gained 3 per cent.Sanofi and Regeneron have 30 days to appeal against the verdict or to come to some kind of commercial arrangement with Amgen, which would most likely involve paying a royalty to their rival.However, a statement from Amgen suggested the company was unwilling to do a deal with the competing drugmakers. “Protecting intellectual property is essential to our industry as it reinforces the incentives for the large and risky investments we make,” said Robert Bradway, Amgen’s chief executive.Amgen said it had the “ability to supply” everyone being prescribed Praluent and that it would “work to ensure a smooth transition for patients who wish to switch”.Regeneron said it would “immediately appeal” against the decision and said the “best interests of patients will be greatly disserved” by the ruling.Amgen now has a monopoly in the US market. The California-based biotech company has a reputation for fiercely protecting its intellectual property and is disparagingly known as a “law firm with fermenters attached” for what some rivals see as a strategy of putting patent disputes before its core business of making drugs.The decision surprised analysts, who were divided on whether Regeneron and Sanofi’s drug will be permanently banned in the US.“Regeneron may appeal or negotiate with Amgen in the meantime, though we think neither are likely to be successful,” said Jeffrey Holford, an analyst at Jefferies.However, Geoff Meacham of Barclays said: “We continue to maintain that this case is far from over and will probably take a few years to play out in appeals.”Ronny Gal, analyst at Bernstein, said: “We have been asked by investors if Amgen would ‘dare’ to force Praluent off the market — we think they certainly would.”Praluent and Repatha block a protein known as PCSK9, which reduces the liver’s ability to release the LDL or “bad” cholesterol that is identified as a major cause of heart disease.PCSK9 inhibitors are not intended to fully replace statins, the main defence against heart disease since the 1990s, but there is a sizeable number of patients who find statins intolerable or who need additional cholesterol reduction.
12;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2017-01-05T22:22:52Z;Amgen blocks competitors from selling rival cholesterol drug;;Amgen won a court ruling that blocks its competitors from selling a rival to its new cholesterol-lowering medicine, sending shares in the large biotech group up by 4.66 per cent in after-hours trading.A US district judge in Delaware ordered Sanofi, the French drugmaker, and Regeneron, the New York biotech, to stop selling their drug Praluent because it infringes on patents protecting Amgen’s medicine, Repatha.Shares in Regeneron, which discovered the drug, were halted, while American depository receipts of Sanofi, the biotech group’s commercial partner, were down 3.98 per cent.Sales of Praluent and Repatha have been sluggish since they were launched in 2015 and 2016, respectively, although analysts predict they will surge in future years if they are proven to reduce heart attacks and other “cardiovascular events” in soon-to-be-published studies.The so-called PCSK9 inhibitors reduce the liver’s ability to release the LDL or “bad” cholesterol that is identified as a major cause of heart disease, and have been touted as an alternative to statins.However, US insurers have resisted paying for the drugs without proof that they actually reduce heart attacks and strokes, rather than just lowering cholesterol.The drugs have a list price of $14,000 per year compared to just a few cents per day for generic statins.
13;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2016-10-17T14:50:33Z;Regeneron, Teva in retreat after drug setback;;Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Teva Pharmecuticals were stung Monday morning by news of a clinical trial setback for a new pain drug they are co-developing.Regeneron saw its shares dip by about 1 per cent after announcing that US regulators had put on hold a clinical trial involving an experimental treatment for chronic low back pain due to safety concerns. The drop shaved off about $350m off the stock’s market valuation. Teva, which is collaborating on the drug, also saw its US-listed shares off by about 1 per cent on Monday.The US Food and Drug Administration had ordered the hold and told Regeneron and Teva to amend the study protocol after observing a case of adjudicated arthropathy – a type of joint disease – in one patient who had osteoarthritis. As a result, Regeneron said it had stopped dosing study patients and was working to design a new study phase that excludes patients with osteoarthritis.The drug, fasinumab, aims to offer treatment for millions of Americans who suffers from chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis without the use of highly addictive opioids, by targeting proteins that grow nerve cells. Rivals Eli Lilly and Pfizer are racing to develop a similar drug, tanezumab, which aims to treat osteoarthritis, back pain and cancer pain, which they aim to submit for approval by 2018.Regeneron chief scientist officer George Yancopoulos said in a statement that the company was making “data-driven decisions” for the next study phase that the company hopes “will maximize the potential benefit for patients in need, while minimizing the likelihood of side effects.”Regeneron has seen its share price soar 512 per cent over the past five years, thanks in part to blockbuster sales for Eylea, which treats a degenerative eye disease and saw US sales reach $2.6bn last year, an increase of 54 per cent from the year before. Its shares were trading at about $367.17 on Monday morning, their lowest point since August.

Positive data and bets by hedge funds that the oil price would rise also helped to send prices higher.But Monday’s pullback led to a broad decline in oil company stock prices.Marathon, the Houston-based exploration and production company, led the pack, falling 6.9 per cent to $15.64 amid the additional investor pressure triggered by managerial changes.JR Sult, the company’s chief financial officer, left the company on Monday, citing personal reasons. Pat Wagner, vice-president of corporate development and strategy, has been named interim chief financial officer.Marathon, also the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 index on Monday, has struggled due to the prolonged drop in oil prices.It reported its sixth straight quarterly loss this month, cutting its production outlook for the year. It has curtailed spending and sold off more than $1bn in assets.It said its revenue fell below $1bn in May for the first time since it became a standalone company in 2002.Other oil stocks also struggled. Murphy Oil was down 3.3 per cent to $29.07, Noble Energy fell 1.5 per cent to $35.57 and Southwestern Energy declined 1.8 per cent to $13.47.At the other end of the spectrum, pharmaceutical companies saw early gains after Pfizer reached a deal worth $14bn to acquire California biotechnology company Medivation.Pfizer, the world’s second-largest drugmaker, saw its stock tick up by 0.2 per cent before giving up ground and closing 0.4 per cent lower at $34.84. Medivation, not in the S&P 500 index, soared higher, up 19.7 per cent to $80.42.The top three performers in the S&P 500 index were pharmaceutical companies.Regeneron rose 3.6 per cent to $418.65, Vertex Pharmaceuticals gained 3 per cent to $100.96 and Alexion Pharmaceuticals climbing 3.3 per cent to $136.53.Elsewhere, clothing brand Urban Outfitters saw its stock fall 3.2 per cent to $36.61 as Goldman Sachs downgraded it from buy to neutral. The bank suggested it was at “near peak” operating performance, leaving less room for meaningful improvement.The S&P 500 was relatively unchanged at 2,182.6, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 18,529.4, and the Nasdaq Composite ticked 0.1 per cent higher to 5,244.6.

Albemarle, a chemicals company, rose 2.5 per cent to $81.32, while Mosaic, a potash fertiliser producer, gained 1.5 per cent to $26.57.The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent for the day to 2,102.9, nearing its all-time high of 2,134.72 reached in May 2015. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 17,949.4, and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent higher at 4,862.6.The higher index levels reflected the sharp turnround in sentiment among US equity investors after markets were shaken by the UK’s Brexit vote the previous week.Oil and natural gas producers were supported as hot summer weather forecasts suggested stronger air-conditioning demand, which feeds back to power plants that burn gas. Among the gainers in the sector were Chesapeake Energy, up 7.2 per cent to $4.59, and Southwestern Energy, up 3.4 per cent to $13.01.Healthcare stocks added to the market’s strength, helped by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, up 0.4 per cent to $349.23, and Celgene, up 2.1 per cent to $100.70.On the losing side of the ledger, chipmaker Micron Technology dropped 9.2 per cent to $12.50 after reporting poor sales and cuts to its payroll.

That compares with a consensus for a 1 per cent decline.Momentum picked up in March. Urban Outfitters had previously signalled that same-store sales at all three brands could decline during the quarter. Sales had been boosted by the leap year, it said.The retailer has faced increased competition from fast fashion retailers such as Zara and H&M.Urban Outfitters said it was acquiring a pizza chain last year in an attempt to lure customers back. “We remain favourable regarding the long-term outlook of the company,” said Richard Jaffe, an analyst at Stifel.The retailer was “driven by a talented management team, significant growth opportunities, industry-leading omnichannel capabilities and strong brand equity, fuelled by highly differentiated merchandise assortments that resonate well with each brand’s targeted customers”.Urban Outfitters shares have advanced 50 per cent this year.Stocks turned mildly positive by midday after a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the US factory sector expanded last month for the first time since August.By the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.6 per cent at 2,072.78, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had climbed 0.6 per cent to 17,792.75 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.9 per cent higher at 4,194.54.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals was the biggest gainer, jumping 12.43 per cent to $405.25.

Telecoms has recorded its best quarterly gain since 2010, while the performance of utilities ranks as the best three month stretch since 2003.Among the main telecoms companies in the S&P, Verizon Communications, a blue-chip telecoms group, rallied 17 per cent to $54.08, while AT&T advanced 13.8 per cent to $39.17.In utilities, Consolidated Edison, a power utility, rose 19.3 per cent to $76.62.On the other side of the spectrum, the two big sectors that ended the quarter in the red were healthcare and financials. Healthcare fell 5.9 per cent, while financials declined 5.6 per cent.Biotechnology stocks sustained a particularly strong hit, with the sector sliding 13.3 per cent, as investors moved away from stocks that are seen as risky and grew more worried about potential regulatory action on drug prices.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals dropped by a third to $360.44, while Gilead, the biggest group in the sector, dropped 9.2 per cent.Financials, meanwhile, came under pressure as the odds for a Fed rate rise for 2016 dimmed and yields on long-term Treasury bonds dropped. Banks earn profits on the difference in the rate they pay for funds and what they earn on loans, so lower-for-longer rates are seen crimping their net interest margins.In addition, there have been lingering concerns about lenders’ exposure to the embattled energy sector. Indeed, Fitch said earlier this month that the default rate among the riskiest US corporate borrowers may hit its highest level ever outside a recession this year.On Thursday the S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 2,059.74, posting a quarterly gain of 0.8 per cent. That leaves the benchmark about 3 per cent below its record closing high of 2,130.82 set in May 2015.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by the same margin on the day to 17,685.09, locking in a first-quarter advance of 1.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite was nearly unchanged on Thursday at 4,869.85, logging a quarterly loss of 2.8 per cent.The S&P 500’s mild first-quarter rise belies the intense volatility that sent the market barometer falling more than 11 per cent for the year at one point. But a stabilisation in the price of oil, brighter sentiment on the US economy and action by global central banks stoked a sharp rebound late in the quarter. The CBOE’s Vix, a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500, was at 13.95 on Thursday, down from a quarterly peak of 28 in mid-February.

19;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2016-02-25T13:02:50Z;Ireland election: voters not convinced of country’s recovery;Poorer areas not feeling benefit of growing economy and job creation;Paddy Flannery can believe that Ireland’s economic revival has reached his home city of Limerick — even if he cannot feel it for himself.He reads in the newspapers about improvements in Dublin and elsewhere, sees signs of it dotted around Limerick in the form of new jobs and investment, and hears Irish prime minister Enda Kenny’s re-election slogan, “Let’s keep the recovery going”.Yet, from his vantage point in the city’s deprived Moyross district, where unemployment is twice the national average, the recovery is something that is happening elsewhere.“I can see it, but I can’t feel it,” says the community activist, who has campaigned on behalf of the area for most of the 40 years he has lived in it. “It will be a while yet before people [here do],” he adds.His observation captures the ambivalence that many in Ireland feel about the revival of the country’s economic fortunes from its worst ever recession as they prepare to vote in Friday’s general election.Despite Ireland being the fastest growing EU economy last year, voters appear unconvinced by the outgoing government’s assertion that the country has been brought back from the brink. In parts of Limerick, Ireland’s most socially deprived city, Mr Kenny’s claims to take credit for the recovery have largely fallen on deaf ears.His inability to convince voters that they are better off now than during the five-year downturn that began in 2008 has made for an unexpectedly difficult election for Mr Kenny and his ruling Fine Gael party — even as opinion polls show its support at about 30 per cent, meaning it will comfortably remain the single biggest party in the new parliament.Four years ago, Ireland’s jobless rate topped 15 per cent as the effects of the crisis bit deeply. But by last month it had fallen to 8.9 per cent, in line with the eurozone average. Foreign direct investment in the booming pharmaceuticals and technology sectors helped the Irish economy grow 7 per cent last year. A net 50,000 new jobs were created in 2015, according to official data, taking the total since the recovery began in mid-2013 to about 160,000.Critics say Mr Kenny’s recovery is too Dublin-centred. Yet there is evidence that other Irish cities are starting to benefit, too. David Jeffreys, co-founder of Action Point, says revenues at his Limerick-based software developer have jumped from €1m to €7m since 2009, while employee numbers have risen from fewer than 10 to 65.“If you look at where we are now and where we were five or six years ago, it’s two different worlds,” Mr Jeffreys says.The strongest evidence of Limerick’s revival is provided by Regeneron, a US biotech company investing $650m to build a drug-ingredients facility that will employ 500 people in the city by the end of next year.The project has particular resonance for the city because it will be on the site of the former Dell manufacturing facility, which closed in 2010 with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs.“We have been supported by the whole city, they were biting our hands off” to win the investment, says Niall O’Leary, a Regeneron vice-president. “The city is coming back, too. It’s changed for the better even in the two years I’ve been here.”Yet the skilled, well-paid jobs that will be created by Regeneron — the type on which Ireland’s economic revival has been built — are of little use to most in Moyross. “There are a lot of young males in this area who haven’t done well at school, and this is compounded by the lack of manual labour jobs,” Mr Flannery says.In some ways, Limerick is unlucky. As the rest of Ireland boomed during the Celtic Tiger years of the 1990s and early 2000s, the city descended into years of drug money-fuelled gang violence perpetrated by a handful of local families.The problem has now been tamed, but it has left behind a legacy and almost certainly cost the city jobs and the opportunity for economic progress. “The Celtic Tiger didn’t roar in Limerick, and we missed that period of investment,” says Conn Murray, chief executive of Limerick City and county council.Limerick is still dealing with the consequences of those two lost decades. The lure of out-of-town shopping centres has left O’Connell Street, its handsome main thoroughfare, almost deserted. The city is awash in plans for regeneration and revival, but it is too early to call it even a work in progress.Still, Mr Flannery is optimistic that the recovery will eventually make its way to Moyross. “If the capital is doing well, surely the whole of Ireland will benefit . . . It’s how you disperse it around the country that will make the difference,” he says. “By then,” he adds,” Friday’s election will have long passed.”

The Kenilworth, New Jersey-based company is conducting a large, late-stage trial for Anacetrapib, a drug that uses a similar mechanism to Evacetrapib. Analysts are expecting sales of $567.2m for the Merck drug in 2019, and $858.6m the following year, according to a poll by Bloomberg.Jeffrey Loo, equity healthcare research analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said the news from Lilly “raises more uncertainty” about Merck’s drug, but “doesn’t necessarily mean [it] won’t be efficacious”.Eli Lilly shares shed 8 per cent at $79.45 by the close of trading.On the other side of the spectrum, companies that were recently approved for new cholesterol drugs climbed on the day. Amgen, which gained US Food and Drug Administration approval for a drug called Repatha in August, climbed 2 per cent to $153.03. Meanwhile, Regeneron, which in partnership with Sanofi scored a green light from the FDA for Praluent in July, rallied 4.6 per cent to $526.83.Mr Loo said both of those drugs are aimed at lowering “bad” cholesterol among people who do not respond well to so-called statins, such as Lipitor.Elsewhere, Phillips 66 said its board approved an increase in its stock buyback of $2bn, bringing the total authorisation to $9bn. The Houston-based oil refiner also unveiled a $3.6bn capital budget for next year, excluding its Philips 66 Partners’ capital programme.Of those capital expenditures, $2bn will go to the midstream business, which includes the continued construction of a liquefied petroleum gas export terminal on the Gulf Coast. It is also investing in pipeline projects to move crude oil from North Dakota’s Bakken region to market centres across the US.Meanwhile, $1.2bn will be invested in the company’s refining business, with 70 per cent of that sum heading to safety and environmental initiatives.By close, the shares were up 0.4 per cent to $83.87.The US energy sector as a whole dropped after its best week of 2015 amid a decline in the price of crude oil. Chevron, an oil major, fell 1 per cent to $88.75. Marathon Oil, which is a big performer in the shale arena, dipped 3 per cent to $18.96.Freeport-McMoRan, the mining heavyweight, saw its shares dip 4 per cent to $12.94. The move came after a 27 per cent surge last week on news the company might spin off its oil and gas division.Shares of US airlines flew higher on the day.

21;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2015-10-06T21:25:23Z;Express Scripts agrees deal for heart drugs;Pharmacy group secures big discount on medicine’s $14,000-a-year price tag;The largest pharmacy group in the US has agreed to make two expensive new heart drugs available to its patients, after securing big discounts from the companies which make the medicines and implementing strict curbs on who is eligible.Express Scripts, the number one pharmacy benefits manager, said it had reached an agreement that covers 25m of its members after the makers of the medicines agreed to cut the $14,000-a-year price tag, although it did not disclose the size of the discount.According to some estimates, the US healthcare system will end up paying more than $20bn a year for the so-called PCSK9 inhibitors, which reduce levels of “bad” or LDL cholesterol by between 55 and 70 per cent.The FDA recently approved two of the drugs — Repatha, made by Amgen, and Praluent, made by Sanofi and Regeneron — for people who have had a heart attack or stroke but cannot reduce their LDL cholesterol to safe levels using statins alone.The drugs were also approved for a genetic condition known as familial hypercholesterolaemia, which leads to dangerously high levels of LDL cholesterol.However, there has been uncertainty over whether companies like Express Scripts, which run prescription drug programmes for employers and insurers, would agree to pay for the medicines because of the huge price tag.Dr Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, said it would not spend more than $750m on the drugs in 2016 because it had secured a discount.The group will also implement an “aggressive utilisation management programme” to ensure only those patients who are eligible for the drugs will receive them.There has been concern that doctors will prescribe the drugs more widely to those patients who experience side effects on statins, which cost less than 50 cents a day, and the utilisation management programme is designed to stop this happening.We did pit them against each other and made it clear we were willing to go exclusive, but the best case scenario is to get the economics you want and the broadest accessDr Miller said both companies had agreed to limit any price hikes for the entire contract, although he would not specify how long the agreement lasts.The negotiation over PCSK9 inhibitors is the most closely watched since Express Scripts refused to pay for Gilead’s $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pill last year and instead signed an exclusive agreement with a rival after securing a big discount.Dr Miller said he was again prepared to give exclusivity to either Amgen or Sanofi-Regeneron but that he had achieved a good enough deal to offer both products.“We did pit them against each other and made it clear we were willing to go exclusive, but the best case scenario is to get the economics you want and the broadest access,” he told the Financial Times.Express Scripts is the first of the large pharmacy benefits managers to sign a deal for the new drugs and its competitors are expected to announce similar agreements shortly.Anthony Hooper, an executive vice-president at Amgen, said: “This is an important milestone for patients. We will continue to engage constructively with other payers to enable patients to have access to Repatha.”
22;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2015-07-12T12:32:26Z;Drugmakers premiere summer blockbusters;New multibillion-dollar drugs offset patent expiries;Blockbuster drugs are back. A wave of new multibillion-dollar medicines for heart disease and high cholesterol, added to recent breakthroughs in cancer and hepatitis C, is reviving optimism that the pharmaceuticals industry has moved beyond the heavy patent losses of the past few years.Last week, Entresto — a heart disease treatment from Novartis, which cut death rates by 20 per cent in clinical trials — was approved by US regulators. Analysts are now tipping it to reach $6bn in annual sales.Similar expectations surround anti-cholesterol drugs from Sanofi of France and Amgen of the US, both of which look set for approval from the US Food and Drug Administration in coming weeks. They were recommended by the regulator’s advisory panel last month.These three weapons against heart failure— the world’s biggest killer — come on the heels of a new category of cancer drugs that harnesses the human immune system to destroy tumours. The first of these so-called immunotherapies was launched by Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb last year and analysts expect them to generate $35bn of annual sales within a decade.Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences has sold about $20bn-worth of its Sovaldi hepatitis C medicine and a follow-on product called Harvoni since the former was approved 19 months ago — making it the most successful drug launch in history.All of the successes reflect a broader pharmaceuticals resurgence. A record 61 drugs were introduced around the world last year, according to Citeline, the research firm, compared with an annual average of 34 in the previous decade.Elias Zerhouni, president of research and development for Sanofi, says the industry is finally feeling the benefits of scientific advances triggered by the sequencing of the human genome 15 years ago. This has led to more targeted treatments and a deeper understanding of the biological processes behind disease.“People are using human genetics in ways that have never been possible before,” he says, citing the way that Sanofi’s new Praluent drug targets a particular protein, called PCSK9, associated with high levels of the “bad” cholesterol linked with heart disease.Praluent and Repatha, the rival Amgen product, are aimed at people who do not respond to statins, the mass-market cholesterol-busters that emerged from pharma’s last golden age of innovation in the 1990s. It was the expiration of patents on blockbusters from this era — such as Pfizer’s Lipitor statin — that sent the industry into a slump from which it is only now recovering.Sales lost to cut-price generic competition reached a peak of $37bn in 2012, according to Evaluate, the research group. But that figure is now falling and forecast to reach $12bn by 2020 — because the paucity of innovation over the past decade has meant fewer drugs patents are ending.A combination of declining patent expiries and rising drug launches ought to create fertile conditions for growth. With an ageing world population, increasing incidence of chronic disease and widening access to healthcare, there is certainly no shortage of demand. Investors appear confident: S&P’s pharmaceuticals index has risen by almost a quarter in the past year.Amid all this optimism, however, there is little sense of triumph among pharma executives. Instead, the mood has been unsettled as a wave of mergers and acquisitions have swept the sector. Big drugmakers have been scrambling to buy promising young biotech companies and trading businesses with each other as they jostle to build the strongest product portfolios.Rather than a sign of confidence from a resurgent industry, some explain this M&A boom as preparation for challenges ahead.Downward pricing pressure hitherto associated with the cash-strapped public health systems of Europe has been spreading across the Atlantic, as the US gets serious about cutting waste from its private health market. A backlash by insurers and health providers against Gilead’s $1,000-a-pill hepatitis C drugs last year was seen by many as a harbinger of tougher times in the world’s biggest pharma market.Alert to these pressures, Novartis has indicated that it will experiment with outcome-based pricing for Entresto in an effort to encourage wide uptake. This would involve a link between price and performance to ensure the company is only rewarded if the medicine works.Sanofi and Amgen are also braced for difficult negotiations over the price of their PCSK9 drugs. Mr Zerhouni acknowledges that, while levels of innovation have risen, so too have commercial hurdles. “If you are not first in class, best in class or a very fast second you will not see a return [on investment].”June 2015: An NHS decision not to stock a new cancer drug from AstraZeneca has seen the UK pharma group accuse the country of stymieing scientific innovation. Andrew Ward explains the predicamentWatch videoThese pressures are also prompting a rethink of the way drugs are developed. Secretive in-house R&D operations are being broken up in favour of collaboration with academia and biotech. Sanofi’s Praluent, for example, was developed in partnership with a smaller US partner called Regeneron. Meanwhile, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have launched fast-track approval processes to speed the path of breakthrough medicines.All these factors have played a role in the R&D renaissance. But Julian Remnant, life science partner at Deloitte, warns that productivity is still depressed by high costs. According to the Tuft Center for the Study of Drug Development in Boston, the average bill for a new drug has risen to $2.6bn, from $802m the last time an estimate was made in 2003.Return on R&D investment edged up to 5.5 per cent in 2014, from 5.1 per cent the year before, according to Deloitte, but Mr Remnant says it is too soon to declare an improving trend. “The industry has got wind in its sails again but it needs to use this momentum to drive change.”Big pharma was supposed to have moved beyond the blockbuster era. Instead of medicines for the masses, many of today’s drug breakthroughs are targeted at specific genetic mutations in smaller numbers of patients.However, there are still plenty of opportunities where the potential market size and price are high enough to achieve blockbuster drug status: annual sales in excess of $1bn. Eleven blockbusters are expected to launch this year, up from three in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters. These include:Praluent (Sanofi/Regeneron): A clinical trial last week showed it reduced “bad cholesterol” by an average 64 per cent among patients with an inherited form of high cholesterol or pre-existing heart disease. Forecast 2019 sales: $4.4bnEntresto (Novartis): A twice daily tablet that reduces strain on a failing heart. Reduced hospitalisation and deaths by one-fifth in trials compared with an existing drug. Forecast 2019 sales: $3.7bnIbrance (Pfizer): Granted conditional approval by US regulators in February for women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer — the most common form of the disease. In combination with AstraZeneca’s Faslodex, the drug slowed cancer progression by 9.2 months, compared with 3.8 months for Faslodex alone. Forecast 2019 sales: $2.8bnRepatha (Amgen): A rival to Sanofi’s Praluent targeting the PCSK9 protein associated with high cholesterol. Both were recommended by an expert panel of the US Food and Drug Administration last month but questions remain over how widely they should be used. Forecast 2019 sales: $1.9bn

It was led on Thursday by a near 3 per cent advance in the biotech sector.The gains follow comments from Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen on Wednesday that the central bank would raise rates slowly and there remained division over the pace at which it should tighten.“The underlying message from yesterday’s meeting was that the prevailing bias remains for the start of policy normalisation later this year,” said Millan Mulraine, strategist with TD Securities. “Wrapped within that message was a dovish tone that suggests the Fed is placing a greater burden on the data to justify any policy action.”The comments buoyed biotech and pharmaceutical companies, which have enjoyed a strong rally this year on industry consolidation and drug advances. Shares of Celgene advanced 4.24 per cent to close at $116.92, Regeneron climbed 2.94 per cent to close at $527.97, Vertex gained 2.89 per cent to close at $127.63, and Amgen rose 2.87 per cent to close at $160.12.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 had set intraday and closing record highs earlier this year.US stocks have also been somewhat rangebound as investors readied for the Fed to move and concerns mounted over valuations.A narrower pace of tightening than expected in March has helped alleviate some of those concerns. Strategists with Wells Fargo note that despite a heightened sense of nervousness by investors, “the bull market likely remains intact”.“Nervousness is rather normal around the first Fed tightening,” said Gina Martin Adams, a strategist with the bank. “Nervousness is also usually rather scarce at the time of bull market peaks.”Two flotations were also well received by the market, with shares of Fitbit and Univar climbing. Shares of the fitness tracking device maker soared 52 per cent to $30.40 in their debut, lifting the company’s valuation to $6.2bn. Fitbit closed at $29.68.Univar, which sold shares on Wednesday at $22 apiece, gained 15.45 per cent to $25.40.Shares of Oracle slid 7 per cent to $41.56 midday after the software maker said profits fell by nearly a quarter to $2.8bn as a strengthening dollar cut into sales. Oracle closed at $42.74.Oracle, which offers database and cloud products for companies, said overall sales fell 5 per cent from a year earlier to $10.7bn in the three months to the end of May, attributing roughly $900m in lost revenues to the dollar.The company reported adjusted earnings of 78 cents a share, short of analyst expectations for 87 cents.Overall, markets advanced on strengthening economic data, as initial jobless claims declined by a better than expected pace and an index of manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region hit its highest level of the year.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both climbed 0.9 per cent to close at 2,120.88 and 18,113.84 respectively.

24;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2015-06-09T23:16:28Z;New heart drugs set to add billions to US healthcare bill;Breakthrough cholesterol-lowering medicines could add $150bn to US health bill;"An expensive new class of heart medicines that threatens to add tens of billions of dollars to the US healthcare bill is set for approval after a panel of experts endorsed one of the new drugs.The medical professionals on Tuesday recommended approval for Praluent, a medicine made by Sanofi and Regeneron, and will meet on Wednesday to examine Repatha, a rival drug made by Amgen, which reduced LDL or “bad” cholesterol by between 55 per cent and 70 per cent in a series of large, late-stage clinical trials.Analysts said they were confident Repatha would be recommended given the backing for Praluent.The drugs would then be set for final approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, the pharmaceuticals watchdog, which almost always follows the recommendations of these advisory committees.Doctors have hailed the arrival of such so-called “PCSK9 inhibitors” as the biggest development in cardiology since the 1990s, when the introduction of statins led to a remarkable reduction in LDL cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease.The advisory panel suggested that Praluent should only be given to specific groups of patients, such as those with familial hypercholesterolaemia, a genetic condition that leads to very high levels of LDL cholesterol.Sanofi, Regeneron and Amgen say the new drugs are not intended to replace statins but are aimed at three groups of patients: those who take statins but still have high levels of LDL cholesterol; those who cannot tolerate statins; and those who have already had a heart attack or stroke.The companies have not yet released pricing information, but analysts and healthcare professionals are working on the assumption they will cost in the region of $10,000 per year.CVS Caremark, the pharmacy group, said that even if the drugs were only given to those with dangerously high levels of cholesterol they would cost the US healthcare system about $16bn a year. That would dwarf the initial costs of Gilead’s Sovaldi, a $1,000-per-pill medicine that sparked a national outcry over drug prices.If this class proves to be as safe and effective as trials suggest, then they could become the biggest class in all of pharmaceuticals, although that would take years to accomplishIf the drugs were also given to statin intolerant patients they would add a further $20bn of costs, while including those with a history of coronary disease would add as much as $150bn, according to CVS Caremark.Despite the huge success of statins, which now cost as little as $4 for a month’s supply, heart disease remains the biggest killer in the US and most other developed countries.Dr Paul Chew, Sanofi’s chief medical officer, said: “Statins have been around for a long time. They are and were a tremendous innovation. But there has been nothing since their arrival that can take LDL cholesterol down by 50-60 per cent, even in high-risk patients.”American Depository Receipts in Sanofi rose 3.6 per cent in after-hours trading in New York on Tuesday. Shares in Regeneron were suspended all day because of the panel hearing.Unlike some medicines, PCSK9 inhibitors are so-called “maintenance drugs” which are intended to be prescribed on a regular basis, normally for the rest of the patient’s life. That means they could put a bigger strain on healthcare systems than drugs such as Sovaldi, which can cure Hepatitis C after 12 months.“If this class proves to be as safe and effective as trials suggest, then they could become the biggest class in all of pharmaceuticals, although that would take years to accomplish,” said Dr Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits manager.Jeffrey Berger, a cardiologist at the New York University Langone Medical Center, said: “The new class of medicines has very exciting properties. Preliminary data suggest they will be a very effective medicine in the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease.”However, he said the profession should wait for data from a series of long-term trials before getting too excited. While studies have conclusively shown the drugs can lower levels of LDL cholesterol, that does not necessarily mean they will reduce the incidence of heart attacks or strokes, he said."

Provenge promised to turn the body’s immune system into a weapon against disease, offering fresh hope to the one in seven men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Known as an “immunotherapy”, it was one of the first treatments of its kind to win approval from US health regulators. When the Food and Drug Administration gave Provenge the green light in 2010, investors piled into shares of Dendreon, the company that made the treatment, sending its market capitalisation to almost $8bn.Analysts hailed a new blockbuster, forecasting peak revenues in excess of $4bn a year. But late last year, Dendreon went bankrupt. Provenge was a flop. Annual sales of just $300m had been hamstrung by its price tag — $93,000 a treatment — and the emergence of better alternatives. The company’s shares, which hit a high of $54 in 2010, ended up being worth a few cents; its assets fetched less than $500m in a fire sale in February.The demise of Dendreon served as a reminder that many companies working on revolutionary drugs fail, but it has done little to calm market excitement surrounding the biotech industry, the subject of intense takeover activity in the past 12 months. The companies in the sector offer to harness two decades of huge advances in genetic science to create new drugs for some of the deadliest diseases. If they succeed they will save countless lives and deliver a windfall for the investors who have been piling into the sector for the past two years.When it comes to funding, the biotech industry has never had it so good. Investors are flooding the sector with money. The New York Stock Exchange Arca biotech index has risen by over 200 per cent since the start of 2011 to 4,131 points, easily outpacing the S&P 500, which has grown 64 per cent. At this rate, it will not be long before the cumulative market capitalisation of US biotech companies tops $1tn.Big pharma groups, facing the loss of exclusivity on many of their drugs and big gaps in their pipelines, have been busy buying biotechs at hefty premiums. Younger companies are able to raise funding with relative ease, first from venture capitalists and then from the public markets: there were 82 initial public offerings of biotech companies in 2014, according to Credit Suisse, eclipsing the record of 67 set in 2000.Adding substanceFor some, the exuberance is eerily familiar to the bull market that preceded the biotech crash of 2000. Yet many investors, analysts and executives say it is different this time. Then, investors were betting on the promise of genomic science, which, much like the dotcom boom of the same period, failed to immediately live up to the hype. Now, however, they are investing in more advanced treatments as the scientific breakthroughs of the past decade reach commercialisation.“We are in a different era. Unlike past bubbles, where there was not a lot of substance, we have terrific science . . . leading to breakthrough therapies,” says Ron Renaud, chief executive of Rana Therapeutics, a Massachusetts-based biotech group.If the bulls are wrong, the consequences would be devastating for investors, who stand to lose hundreds of billions of dollars, but also for patients. Should markets take fright, the industry would struggle to secure the funding, hampering its attempts to discover the next breakthrough drug.It took over a decade for the biotech sector to recover after the 2000 bubble burst. Some fear any similar fall today would leave the genetic medicine revolution moving back into the slow lane.Investors are already jittery. Last month, Gilead, the California-based maker of a $1,000-a-day hepatitis-C pill, prompted a sharp sell-off across the sector by warning its treatments should not be used in combination with a particular type of heart drug. Mixing the two had led to abnormally slow heartbeats in nine patients, one of whom had died of cardiac arrest.Analysts were sanguine about the impact on Gilead, let alone other biotech companies, but that did not stop the correction erasing all of the March gains on the NYSE Arca biotech index. It was the third time in six months that investors ditched biotech stocks because of problems at Gilead, the largest biotech group with a market capitalisation of $150.9bn at the end of last week.Yet some bulls point to the very existence of large-cap biotechs as a sign that bubble fears are overdone. In 2001, the cumulative market capitalisation of the top five biotech groups was $82bn. Now Gilead, Amgen, Biogen, Celgene and Regeneron are worth over $500bn combined. Gilead is bigger than many of the best-known names in pharma, including GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb, while Biogen is larger than AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly.The success of these groups, all of which were founded in the late 1970s or 1980s, shows the biotech model is scaleable and long-lasting, according to Ravi Mehrotra, biotech analyst at Credit Suisse. That is propitious for some of the groups that recently completed IPOs, such as Bluebird Bio, a specialist in rare diseases, which has seen its market capitalisation surge by almost 400 per cent to $4bn since its IPO in 2013.“The financial markets for the first time know that successful biotechs can attain greater than a $100bn market cap . . . and thus it is logical for them to pay more for present day small and mid-cap companies that may be the bellwethers of the future,” he says.Others argue that a big leap forward in genetic science is now producing effective drugs marking a clear difference to the 2000 bubble. “Before the 1990s we only had a crude understanding of genomic science — it was a black box,” recalls Kevin Starr, a partner at Third Rock Ventures, which has raised $1.3bn to invest in biotech and life sciences companies. “Circa 2000, we had the human genome and there were suddenly lots of investments in companies trying to understand genomics. But they weren’t applying the science to anything investible.”Mr Starr, who worked at biotech group Millennium between 1998 and 2003, recalls how the initial euphoria surrounding genetic science was replaced by the realisation that many of their discoveries were not “druggable”.“We thought if you found the gene that caused a disease you would simply be able to ‘drug it’. The technology had great promise, but then we realised it would take decades.”But, says Mr Starr, better scientific knowledge is now coinciding with a big data revolution that makes it easier to crunch laboratory data, while advances in automation and miniaturisation have made drug development cheaper.‘Not amazing enough’Genomic science is producing revolutionary new drugs, from a cure for hepatitis-C to immunotherapy treatments. Yet some believe that the companies’ prospects do not justify their stratospheric valuations.“My gut reaction is that biotech valuations are always too high,” says Amit Roy, a pharmaceuticals analyst at the independent Foveal research group. “We need to think about which patients are going to get given the drug. The same mistake is always made: the drug is amazing, but it is not amazing enough.”Mr Roy accuses some analysts of “double counting” in their sales forecasts. When a new drug is close to getting regulatory approval, some incorrectly assume the drug will be given to all the patients who would benefit. But when a rival therapy is approved, they perform the same calculation — although the two drugs are chasing the same set of patients.Even bullish analysts admit it is a stretch to set current biotech valuations using traditional metrics. “When I look at valuations, the old way I used . . . no longer works,” says Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum. “Almost all the stocks I cover . . . trade above, in many cases double-digit percentage points, their base case DCFs,” he adds, referring to a common valuation method known as discounted cash flow. “You can get to current stock prices if you assume greater R & D productivity going forward than has been the case over the very long term,” says Mr Schoenebaum.Competitive fieldIan Read, chief executive of Pfizer, admitted recently that he was concerned by “buoyant” valuations of biotech stocks. Yet Pfizer was one of the companies involved in a three-way bidding war last month for Pharmacyclics, the maker of a drug for blood cancers. It offered $19.8bn for the group, according to people who worked on its offer, but was trumped by AbbVie, which ended up sealing a deal for $21bn.Richard Gonzalez, chief executive of AbbVie, described the takeover battle as “one of the most competitive I’ve ever seen”. But for some, the $21bn price tag for a company that makes just one drug was proof that the sector is overheating.Mr Gonzalez’s estimates imply the drug will achieve annual peak sales of $11.5bn, compared to the typical Wall Street estimate of around $6bn. A recent straw poll of over 300 analysts found almost 90 per cent thought AbbVie had overpaid for Pharmacyclics.“Are there valuations that are out of proportion to reality? There probably are,” says Brent Saunders, the chief executive of Actavis who engineered the biggest takeover of 2014 — the $70.5bn acquisition of Botox maker Allergan. “There are certain areas where there are arms races,” says Mr Saunders.He puts hepatitis-C, where there are two companies offering an effective cure with a third soon to join the fray, in that category. Some investors fret the drugs will not be able to command high prices with so much competition.Some lawyers and bankers say high prices could make it harder for big pharma groups to justify takeovers to shareholders. Geoffrey Levin, partner at legal firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, says high valuations and a healthy market for IPOs are prompting some big pharma groups to target smaller, often privately held, biotech groups, where the early stage science is riskier, but the potential rewards are far larger.Yet few believe the large-cap pharma groups will stop doing big-ticket biotech deals any time soon because they desperately need new products to fill their own drug pipelines, depleted by years of under-investment and R & D failures. Barely a day goes by without a spike in the shares of a biotech group. Names that are often mentioned as takeover targets include Receptos, the Californian maker of drugs for autoimmune disorders including multiple sclerosis and BioMarin, which develops treatments for rare genetic diseases.“Since most big pharma R & D pipelines are not producing new products with as much revenue as they need to replace drugs going off patent, these companies are willing to pay a premium for new therapies that have received, or are close to receiving, [regulatory] approval,” says Frank Aquila, an attorney at Sullivan & Cromwell. “Today, more times than not, they will be biotech products.”If anything, a large correction in biotech stocks could be helpful for big pharma, allowing companies to pick up promising assets at depressed valuations. It would be a problem, though, for nascent biotech groups or for the venture capital groups they turn to for their first rounds of funding.“I’m worried that a few high-profile failures could tar others with the same brush, which would have some blowback for the rest of the industry,” warns Mr Starr. “Whenever you get success, you see a herd mentality.”As home to pioneers such as Alexander Fleming and Louis Pasteur, Europe has a rich history of medical science. Yet the region’s investors have struggled to match the enthusiasm of US counterparts for helping push innovation from the laboratory bench to the hospital bed. While Europe boasts several of the world’s biggest pharmaceuticals groups, such as Roche, Novartis and Sanofi, it has relatively fewer of the young biotech companies that keep the US life sciences sector in a constant state of renewal.With a market capitalisation of SFr13.5bn ($13.8bn), the biggest homegrown European biotech group — Actelion of Switzerland — is a fraction of the size of top US counterparts such as Gilead and Biogen.European biotech entrepreneurs bemoan a lack of risk appetite and specialist investment funds of the kind that have fuelled the US boom. This leads to a more conservative approach by European start-ups, according to Adi Hoess, chief executive of Germany’s Affimed. “If you see €40m on a US biotech’s balance sheet you are worried because it means they need to raise more. If you see a European company with that much money you do not need to worry for at least two years.”The greater pool of capital available in the US has led several European companies to cross the Atlantic in search of funding. Adaptimmune of the UK this month became the latest to announce plans for a Nasdaq initial public offering.At the same time US companies are looking at European deals, with Bristol-Myers Squibb agreeing to invest $100m in Uniqure, a Dutch gene therapy company. This US interest has combined with signs of a revival in local appetite to boost companies such as Genmab of Denmark, Sobi of Sweden and Galápagos of Belgium, which have seen strong share price rises in the past 12 months. But only when some of these begin emulating the likes of Gilead by making serious profits are European investors likely to embrace this riskiest of sectors. Andrew Ward"
26;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2015-01-22T09:13:08Z;US investors double down on biotech bets;Advances in innovation help sector add to 2014 gains, bucking wider January sell-off;Investors in US equities confronted with a volatile market so far this month are returning to one of their favoured trades of recent years: betting on biotech.Having risen 100 per cent over the preceding two years, biotechs have maintained their ability to outperform the broad S&P 500. Already this month the Nasdaq biotech index has risen 5.7 per cent, rebounding from a sell-off during December and adding more than $40bn to its market cap, compared with the broader S&P 500 which is little changed.The leadership by biotechs reflects how companies in the sector sit at the cutting edge of potential medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs, promising huge rewards for investors. In a low-growth environment biotechs are seen by investors as one of the few sectors that can deliver compelling opportunities.After four years of double-digit gains for the sector and five years when it has finished ahead of the benchmark S&P 500, Wall Street believes the biotech boom can continue.“We have witnessed significant innovation in the biotech industry over the early part of this decade, highlighted by cures in hepatitis C and transformative advances in prostate cancer, multiple sclerosis and numerous orphan diseases,” said Geoffrey Meacham, an analyst with Barclays.“Rather than signalling a period of innovation lag, we believe we are still in the early-to-middle innings of a wave of innovation.”The bank also expects brisk earnings growth and projects a 19 per cent rise in large-cap biotech earnings this year, compared with an 8 per cent advance by the S&P 500 and an 11 per cent rise by healthcare, given drug launches and a slate of trials.But risks remain high, particularly for smaller companies awaiting data from trials and for looming drug launches. Goldman Sachs noted that expectations for some upcoming debuts varied greatly, which could present a hurdle for stocks. Forecasts for Vertex’s much-anticipated cystic fibrosis treatment range between a low of $1.3bn and a high of $2.8bn in 2016, which could represent three-quarters of the company’s overall sales.Rather than signalling a period of innovation lag, we believe we are still in the early-to-middle innings of a wave of innovationThe potential for lower payouts from pharmacy benefit managers and a rotation into other sectors of the market could also dent the biotech bull run.“Any sector that has had a three year-plus run like biotech, the risk grows as correlations between stocks grow,” says Matthew Harrison, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. “A speed bump for one of the major biotechs appears to have significant sector implications.”Market valuations of three stalwarts of the industry — Biogen Idec, Gilead and Regeneron — have more than doubled over the past two years. New treatments, including Gilead’s blockbuster Sovaldi and Harvoni hepatitis C medications, have proved a fillip. Wall Street expects the latter to generate sales of $39.6bn between 2015 and 2017.The soaring valuations of the largest biotech companies are not particularly troublesome, according to analysts with Barclays and Morgan Stanley, who point to metrics such as price/earnings and equity value-to-sales ratios. The Nasdaq biotech index trades with a p/e of 42.7 times expected 2015 results, below the 72.6 level recorded in 2012 but far above that of the S&P 500, data from Bloomberg show.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
27;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2014-09-18T15:36:26Z;Europe struggles to catch US biotech bulls;The Nasdaq biotech index is on the rise again;Boom times are back for US biotechnology. After a wobble in the spring when Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, warned that valuations were stretched, the Nasdaq biotech index is on the rise again, up 20 per cent since January.Yet, across the Atlantic, the mood is more subdued. Valuations are rising in Europe too, but without the fizz that has surrounded the US sector for most of the past two years.Almost $4bn has been raised by US biotech companies in 43 initial public offerings and follow-on fundraisings this year, while in Europe the comparable figures are $1.4bn from 28, according to Dealogic.“UK and European IPO markets have been doing almost as well as the US market this year, but whereas the US has been led by biotech listings, there have been relatively few in Europe,” says Richard Truesdell, head of capital markets at Davis Polk, the law firm.To seasoned observers, this more cautious European approach might seem welcome given the heavy losses suffered after the previous biotech boom 15 years ago.However, to others, it is evidence of a lack of risk appetite that is undermining European life sciences. “When I go to London and explain the biotech growth story they view the sector as very risky,” says Geoffrey Hsu, partner at OrbiMed, a US-based healthcare fund manager. “There have been some failures that still colour perceptions even though the sector has changed a lot in the past decade.”As bulls such as Mr Hsu see it, Europe is missing out on a historic re-rating of the biotech industry as commercial dividends finally start to flow from the decoding of the human genome and other scientific advances.Sceptics say they have heard this story before. Hype about the potential of genetic sequencing to open a new era of personalised medicine, in which treatments are tailored for individual patients, helped inflate a biotech bubble in the late 1990s that quickly deflated as it became clear such breakthroughs were still years away.However, Mr Hsu and others say the sector is now more mature, with big biotech companies such as Gilead Sciences, Amgen and Biogen producing revenues to rival traditional big pharma, and a new wave of upstarts such as Regeneron and Alexion showing similar promise.In Europe, such success stories are rare. The £32bn sale of UK-listed Shire to AbbVie of the US in July will, once completed, remove one of the few young European life science companies to have broken into the big league.After Actelion of Switzerland, with a market capitalisation of $13bn, it is a big jump down to the next rank of young pretenders, such as Morphosys of Germany, Genmab of Denmark and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum with valuations of around $2bn.Gilead, king of the US biotech sector, in contrast, is now bigger even than traditional European pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi, with a valuation of $157bn after the success of its groundbreaking hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi.There are many factors that explain the transatlantic disparity. Some say the greater entrepreneurial drive in the US helps commercialise scientific discoveries that in Europe might remain languishing in a university laboratory. Others say it reflects the incentives for innovation created by America’s private healthcare market compared with Europe’s cash-strapped public health systems.Whatever the underlying reason, it manifests itself in a much tougher financing environment for European biotech – both in terms of venture capital and equity funding from public markets. This translates into slower and more cautious drug development compared with lavishly funded US rivals.This has led several European companies to make initial public offerings in the US, including GW Pharmaceutical, the UK-based maker of cannabis-based medicines for epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. Its shares spent a decade stagnating on London’s junior AIM market before adopting a dual listing on Nasdaq last year. The stock has since soared from an offer price of $8.90 to $88.56 after success in clinical trials, valuing the company at $1.8bn.However, there are tentative signs that Europe could be warming up to the biotech growth story.While, still a long way short of US levels, the amount raised by biotech companies in European equity markets this year is already more than double the amount raised in the whole of 2013, according to Dealogic. A big part of this was the £200m raised in London in March by Circassia, an anti-allergy specialist, in what was the largest biotech float anywhere in the world so far this year.A steady stream of IPOs has followed, especially in Paris, spurred by French tax incentives for investment in research-based companies.Rafaèle Tordjman, managing partner at Sofinnova, a healthcare-focused French venture capital fund, says American investors are increasingly looking to European biotech as valuations soar in the US. In some recent fundraisings they have accounted for as much as two-thirds of the participation.While nobody is expecting a Nasdaq-style boom, numerous European biotech companies are considering IPOs. Hugh Griffith, chief executive of Nucana, an Edinburgh-based cancer drug developer, says he will consider both London and New York for a potential float. “The breadth of analyst coverage and the depth of the investment pool in the US is attractive, but the UK market is opening up.”This optimism is echoed by Jim Phillips, chief executive of Midatech, an Oxford-based specialist in nanotech-based medicines which is considering an IPO. “I am surprised how vibrant London is feeling,” he says. “I think there is hope for the sector.”Wrong formula: groups struggle to make successes payWhen AbbVie moves its tax domicile to the UK in coming months, it will mark a homecoming of sorts for the Chicago-based pharmaceutical company’s most important product, Humira.The rheumatoid arthritis medicine was the world’s best-selling drug last year, with revenues of $10.7bn, and it owes its success to scientists in the UK, where it was developed by Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT).But the medicine was licensed to Abbott, of which AbbVie used to be part, and CAT was bought by AstraZeneca, creating a case study in how the spoils of drug innovation often land a long way from the laboratories where they were discovered.As AbbVie proceeds with its £32bn takeover of UK-listed Shire – a so-called inversion deal in which the US company will move its tax home to Britain – the story of Humira also shows how European biotech companies have struggled to match the success of US counterparts in commercialising scientific breakthroughs.Shire and CAT are among a series of promising UK life science companies that have been swallowed by big pharma over the past 15 years, in contrast to US biotech companies such as Gilead Sciences and Biogen, which have become powerhouses in their own right.Richard Girling, partner and healthcare specialist at Centerview Partners, the investment bank, says the UK in particular has an opportunity to thrive in biotech through its world class university science and government initiatives such as the 100,000 Genome Project, which aims to harness genetic research within the National Health Service.However, Mr Girling says investors need more patience if they are to build a life science sector to rival that of the US. Many have been stung by past failures in an industry where only about 7 per cent of drugs in early-stage development reach market.“Most biotech companies don’t succeed on their first molecule or target so they need time and financial headroom,” he says. “There is more venture capital money coming back into the European market…but it is going to take a few years to really rebuild.”
28;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2014-09-02T20:47:33Z;Biotech stocks buoyed by bullish broker UBS;US equity markets waver following Monday holiday;US biotech stocks were buoyed on Tuesday after brokerage UBS lifted price targets for a swathe of companies in the sector on its view that new medications and potential merger and acquisition activity will boost earnings.The investment bank said it remained bullish on the sector, despite a 22 per cent advance by the Nasdaq biotech index this year, ahead of the release of new trial data this autumn.If successful, analysts with the bank say it could “trigger price-to-earnings multiple expansion” as expectations are currently low.“We continue to see new product cycles and mid to long-term growth as a strong basis for valuation despite relative outperformance of large-cap biotech over the past few years,” Matthew Roden, an analyst with UBS, said.Mr Roden added large biotech groups, flush with cash from recent drug hits, would aid shares of smaller companies in the sector.“We are more bullish on mergers and acquisitions given the inflection of cash flows in large-cap, coupled with the need for large-cap to address toughening growth comps by 2016-17, and because mid-caps have done a good job in value creation,” he said.The sector’s advance this year has been in fits and starts, cooling after US politicians, as well as officials at the World Health Organisation, voiced concerns over the price tag of a successful Hepatitis-C treatment.Strong sales results from the Gilead medication alleviated some of those concerns. Several analysts on Wall Street predict first year sales of the treatment will near $10bn.UBS increased its price target on Gilead to $125 from $115, Achillion to $15 from $11, Regeneron to $360 from $320 and Amgen to $155 from $129.Regeneron shares climbed 3 per cent to $359.50, Achillion rose 6 per cent to $12.27 and Gilead advanced 2 per cent to $109.36.Tuesday offered another lesson for investors in biotech: disappointing trial data can cut short a stock’s rally, as was the case with Exelixis.The company, which is engaged in prostate cancer research, said it would lay off 70 per cent of its staff after an experimental drug failed a late-stage study, sending shares 55 per cent lower to $1.85.Family Dollar, which has agreed to sell itself to Dollar Tree for $8.5bn, said it would review a new $80-a-share offer presented by Dollar General, lifting all three companies.In a short statement it said that its board “has not changed its recommendation in support of the merger with Dollar Tree”.Family Dollar last month rebuffed Dollar General’s first, $78.50-a-share bid, arguing that the chief obstacle was its concern that US competition regulators would quash a deal to combine the country’s two largest discount chains.Dollar General said it would divest more stores in an attempt to gain regulatory compliance.Family Dollar shares rose nearly 1 per cent to $80.22, Dollar General increased 1 per cent to $64.36 and Dollar Tree advanced 2 per cent to $54.46.Norwegian Cruise Line agreed to pay $3bn in cash and shares for smaller rival Prestige Cruises, which operates the Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Sea Cruises brands.Kevin Sheehan, the chief executive of Norwegian, said that the acquisition would provide for a “solid accretion to earnings per share and drive long-term shareholder value”.Analysts with Stifel Nicolaus said the deal “makes sense” considering Prestige’s position in the luxury cruise market.“Luxury has been the one area of cruise which has been relatively stable over the past couple of years, whereas the contemporary brands have been more impacted by economic events while also being impacted by negative press headlines about the cruise industry,” Steven Wieczynski, an analyst with Stifel, said.Shares of Norwegian soared 11 per cent to $36.99.Overall, US equity markets wavered following a Monday holiday. The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,002.28 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 17,067.56. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 4,598.19.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
29;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2014-07-30T17:21:24Z;Rising sales and job cut plan boost Amgen;;The biotech sector was lifted on Wednesday by better than expected results from one of the industry’s bellwethers as well as regulatory approval of a medication from a smaller peer.Amgen, the second-largest member of the Nasdaq biotech index, lifted its full-year earnings forecast as sales of several of its drugs accelerate.The company said it now expects 2014 earnings – excluding certain items – to range between $8.20 to $8.40 per share, up from a range between $7.90 and $8.20. Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of $8.10 per share.The upgraded forecast accompanied second-quarter results, which showed an 11 per cent rise in revenues to $5.2bn and 23 per cent increase in profits to $1.55bn.Sales of Enbrel, Amgen’s top drug for arthritis, rose 7 per cent from a year ago. Total product sales rose 8 per cent.Robert Bradway, the company’s chief executive, called the quarterly results “robust”.The company said it also planned to cut as many as 2,900 jobs, or 15 per cent of its workforce, in a bid to cut costs and restructure.The California-based company will consolidate facilities and expects to close plants in Seattle and Bothell, Washington, and Boulder and Longmont, Colorado.“The company is making progress advancing the pipeline while implementing restructuring to redirect spending to support upcoming new product launches in 2015 and 2016 needed to drive top-line growth,” Citi analyst Yaron Werber said.UBS analysts noted Amgen was an “industry bellwether” and its strategic initiatives would likely light a path for other large-cap peers.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals shares advanced after the biopharmaceutical company said the US Food and Drug Administration had approved its eye treatment – an injection called Eylea – as a treatment for Diabetic Macular Edema.Analysts with Citigroup estimate Eylea could tally sales of $1.8bn this year.Shares of Amgen advanced 5 per cent to $129.98 while Regeneron climbed 6 per cent to $322.18. The broader Nasdaq biotech index rose 1 per cent to 2,692.61.Twitter shares surged 20 per cent to $46.30 after the company’s latest quarter bucked a disappointing trend in user numbers. The much-watched number of monthly active users increased 6 per cent quarter on quarter and 24 per cent year on year to 271m.Although chief executive Dick Costolo has been squeezing more advertising revenues from each of the company’s users, anxiety over Twitter’s ability to add users has shaped the performance of the shares so far this year.Analysts across Wall Street lifted price targets on the company following its results, with those at RBC saying Facebook provided a “clear road map” of where Twitter profits could go.Facebook shares climbed 1 per cent to $74.68, Yahoo advanced 3 per cent to $36.60 and LinkedIn rose 4 per cent to $187.29.SodaStream shares popped 10 per cent to $32.76 after the company reported second-quarter results ahead of Wall Street forecasts.Revenues climbed in Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East and Africa last quarter, lifting overall sales 6.6 per cent to $141.2m.Profits slipped to $9.2m, or 43 cents a share, from $12.9m in the year-ago period. The company said US sales remained under pressure as it “struggled to drive consumer demand and retailers worked through excess inventory carried over from the holiday season”.SodaStream added it is trying to “reposition” the brand in the US “behind health & wellness”.Genworth Financial shares slumped by more than a tenth after the company said higher-than-expected claim costs in its long term care insurance business forced the company to conduct a review of the adequacy of its reserves.Second-quarter profits also trailed Wall Street expectations, at 31 cents per share. Shares declined 14 per cent to $13.98.Overall, equity markets moderately increased after a better than expected report on US economic activity.The S&P 500 rose less than 0.1 per cent to 1,970.07 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 16,880.36. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 4,462.90.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

Broadly, however, investor shifts seem to point to further weakness, he says.“Although a short-term trading focus generally does not mesh well with most institutional fund managers’s management style, we expect that shorter, more volatile multi-week rotations are likely to persist through the second quarter and into the third,” Mr Sluymer said.Tesla shares declined 2.11 per cent to $193.91, Facebook fell 3 per cent before recovering to close slightly higher at $59.08 and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals slipped by 0.67 per cent to $288.08.Coca-Cola led the benchmark S&P 500 after the company reported adjusted earnings that matched Wall Street expectations.First-quarter profits fell to $1.62bn, or 36 cents a share, from $1.75bn, or 39 cents a share, in the same quarter in 2013.Revenues declined 4 per cent to $10.6bn. When adjusting for certain items, Coca-Cola said it earned 44 cents per share.The Atlanta-based company said volumes of sparkling beverages in the North American market fell 1 per cent during the quarter.On a call with analysts, chairman and chief executive Muhtar Kent said he was determined to “accelerate” sparkling beverage growth by increasing marketing efforts as well as making new investments to support its brands.“These strategies to accelerate sparkling growth are solid and we expect to see improving results throughout the year,” he said.Shares in Coca-Cola rose 3.72 per cent to close at $40.17.Aaron’s, the US retailer that specialises in renting and selling furniture, was under pressure on Tuesday after the company rejected a takeover proposal and announced it had purchased a retail credit financing firm.The company has agreed to pay $700m for Progressive Finance Holdings, a maker of software used by retailers in the controversial so-called “lease to own” part of the retail market.Aaron’s, which has a market value of about $2.1bn, also rebuffed a takeover offer from private equity firm Vintage Capital. Shares in the company declined just over 4 per cent to end at $29.24.Overall, US equity indices shook off early declines to end the day slightly higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.68 per cent to 1,842.98 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.55 per cent higher at 16,262.56. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.29 per cent to close at 4,034.16.
31;REGN;Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
