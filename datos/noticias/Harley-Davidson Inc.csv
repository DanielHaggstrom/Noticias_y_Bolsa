Consider what has happened to beer and breakfast cereal. But in the case of Harley-Davidson, maker of the motorcycle brand, changing millennial tastes may actually be the issue.The company is seeking a new boss this week after Matt Levatich unexpectedly stepped down late Friday as chief executive. His was a bumpy ride. Since taking the helm in May 2015, Harley has lost half of its market value even as the S&P 500 gained 40 per cent. Revenue grew in only one of Mr Levatich’s five years at the top. Operating margins nearly halved to around 11 per cent.America is by far Harley’s biggest market, nearly 70 per cent. Hog-riding baby boomers there are ageing fast and making fewer purchases. The problem for Harley is young people do not have the spending power — or the interest — to make up for that decline. Why spend $20,000 on a loud, heavy motorcycle when you can Uber, cycle, scooter or use public transport to get around?Harley has tried to appeal to younger folk by launching lighter and more affordable models. It also made a foray into electric bikes with the introduction of the LiveWire last year. Neither initiative has gained much traction however. Motorcycle shipment volume fell for a fifth straight year in 2019. Mr Levatich has had his share of mis-steps. He failed to navigate through President Donald Trump’s tariff war two years ago. Harley’s move to shift some manufacturing out of the US to avoid EU tariffs earned it the ire of Mr Trump. Bringing in the company’s first-ever global brand president last year was a fiasco. That person was dismissed after just six months over personal-conduct violations.There are no easy answers to fixing Harley’s sales woes. Whoever becomes the next Harley chief may simply have to accept that the US market is in decline. The company’s energy should focus harder on attracting more overseas riders to the famed American brand.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

1;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2020-02-28T23:27:57Z;Harley-Davidson chief steps down after market struggle;Motorcycle manufacturer has battled to reverse a decline in sales;The chief executive of Harley-Davidson has stepped down as part of a leadership shake-up at the American motorcycle manufacturer, which has struggled to reverse a decline in sales.The Milwaukee-based company said on Friday it had appointed board member Jochen Zeitz as acting president and chief executive, replacing Matthew Levatich, who has led the company since 2015. Mr Levatich has also left his position on the board. Mr Zeitz also replaced Michael Cave as chairman and will retain the position once Harley-Davidson appoints a new chief executive. The company said it will an external search firm. Mr Zeitz, the former chief executive of sportswear company Puma, said in a statement that the board and Mr Levatich “mutually agreed that now is the time for new leadership at Harley-Davidson”. During the 55-year-old Mr Levatich’s tenure as chief executive, Harley-Davidson sought to revamp its model line-up and develop a new generation of riders to increase sales. It launched its first electric bike, the LiveWire, last year in a bid to attract new, younger customers. However, sales continued to decline last year. “Matt was instrumental in defining the ‘More Roads to Harley-Davidson’ accelerated plan for growth, and we will look to new leadership to recharge our business,” Mr Zeitz added. “He has worked tirelessly to navigate the company through a period of significant industry change while ensuring the preservation of one of the most iconic brands in the world.” Mr Levatich, a 26-year veteran at Harley-Davidson, will remain with the company until the end of March to assist with the transition. Shares in Harley-Davidson rose 5 per cent in after-hours trading. The company has grappled with declining motorcycle demand in its home market, as well as competitive pressure from rivals such as Polaris, owner of the Indian brand. Harley-Davidson’s global retail sales fell 4.3 per cent to 218,273 units in 2019. Sales in the US were down 5.2 per cent.Harley-Davidson also found itself in the middle of a tariff fight between the US and European Union, which targeted the company’s bikes in a set of retaliatory levies in 2018. Harley-Davidson shifted some motorcycle production to plants located outside the US, drawing the ire of Donald Trump.
2;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2019-10-14T19:03:54Z;Harley-Davidson’s first electric motorcycle hits production snag;Bike maker halts deliveries of the LiveWire after finding glitch;Harley-Davidson halted production of its first electric motorcycle after finding a glitch, hitting pause on a model that the iconic American brand hopes will spark sales growth in its home market.The company has temporarily stopped production and deliveries of the LiveWire due to a “non-standard condition” discovered during a final quality check. Harley-Davidson said additional tests are “progressing well”. It did not provide a timeline for when production may resume.“We are in close contact with our LiveWire dealers and customers and have assured them they can continue to ride LiveWire motorcycles. As usual, we’re keeping high quality as our top priority,” Harley-Davidson said in a statement.Harley-Davidson in 2014 first revealed plans to develop an electric bike in an effort to attract new, younger riders and in turn boost lacklustre sales in the US. The Milwaukee-based company reported domestic retail sales that were down 10.2 per cent year-over-year in 2018. In July, Harley-Davidson lowered its forecast for global shipments this year to a range of 212,000 to 217,000 units, compared with 228,051 last year.Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said dealers’ expectations for LiveWire sales are “cautious”, citing in part the new model’s price of around $30,000. The LiveWire, which was initially expected to arrive in showrooms in August, also faced reported delays.“The limited initial units are expected to sell well, which is not unexpected for a brand-new and long-touted model. However, it does not seem that pre-orders have picked up meaningfully over the last several months beyond early adopters, as the $30K price tag is too steep for many, particularly younger riders for whom the bike was largely intended,” he wrote in a note to clients last week.Shares in Harley-Davidson dropped nearly 2 per cent immediately following news of the production halt but have since clawed back most of those losses. The stock was down 0.2 per cent in recent trading.
3;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2019-07-23T12:05:53Z;Harley-Davidson trims motorcycle shipments forecast as tariffs bite;US group says it is struggling to secure favourable trade treatment for Thai operations;Harley-Davidson on Tuesday lowered its full-year motorcycle shipment forecasts citing delays in regulatory approvals and weaker European retail sales, highlighting how Washington’s tariff war has made business more complicated for corporate America.The Milwaukee-based company said it recently “obtained regulatory approvals confirming that motorcycles shipped from the company’s Thailand operations to the EU would receive more favourable tariff treatment than if they were shipped from the US”.However, the motorcycle maker said the approval process took “considerably longer” than planned and that alongside “softer than expected European retail sales” prompted it to lower its forecast for motorcycle shipments this year.For the full year, the company now expects shipments of between 212,000 to 217,0000, lower than its April forecast for 217,000 to 222,000.It also cut its full-year motorcycles segment operating margin to between 6 to 7 per cent, down from between 8 to 9 per cent before.Harley-Davidson now forecasts a $100m hit from tariffs this year, down from its previous estimate of as much as $120m, as it has become one of the highest-profile victims of Washington’s multi-fronted trade battle and faced new tariffs in Europe and China in retaliation for levies introduced by President Donald Trump, and tariffs at home that have increased the costs of components and materials that the company imports.The softer outlook accompanied a 6 per cent decline in second-quarter revenues to $1.43bn, just shy of analysts' expectations for $1.44bn, according to a Refinitiv survey of Wall Street analysts, as the company shipped fewer motorcycles amid weak domestic demand.The company shipped 68,757 motorcycles in the quarter, down 5.3 per cent from a year ago but in the range it had previously guided for.Worldwide retail sales decreased 8.4 per cent, and in the US they were down 8 per cent driven by “continued weak industry sales”.Net income slid to $195.6m or $1.23 a share in the three months ended in June, down from $242.3m or $1.45 a share in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for restructuring costs and the impact of “incremental tariffs” the company posted adjusted earnings of $1.46 a share, exceeded analysts’ expectations.Harley-Davidson is targeting building 2m new riders in the US and to grow its international business by halfway through the end of 2027. The company, which has struggled to draw in millennial consumers, is targeting the electric market as it seeks to grow its customer base and said preparations are ongoing for a September delivery of its first electric motorcycle.In the current quarter, the company forecast motorcycle shipments of between 43,000 to 48,000.Harley shares, which are up less than 1 per cent year-to-date as of Monday’s close, were down more than 4 per cent to $32.90 in pre-market trade.
4;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2019-03-05T15:37:24Z;Harley-Davidson aims to put tykes on bikes with StaCyc deal;Historic motorbike group buys children’s electric bike maker in move to woo younger riders;Harley-Davidson has bought a maker of electric bicycles for children in a bid to woo younger riders, as the historic US motorcycle manufacturer looks to turn round declining sales and offset an ageing customer base.The Milwaukee-based company said on Tuesday it had purchased StaCyc, a small producer of electric bikes. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.The deal marks the motorbike maker’s latest effort to diversify its business away from its traditional large and loud cruising motorbikes and — more importantly — help it glean insights on how to cater to younger consumers who may one day buy a Harley.“The StaCyc electric two-wheelers will provide an entry point for the youngest riders to enjoy the thrill of riding,” the company said in a statement.StaCyc was founded in 2016 and its electric bikes retail for between $649 and $699, roughly a tenth of the cost of an entry-level Harley.The acquisition comes almost a year to the day since Harley’s last deal. The company, which has long shied away from large-scale acquisitions, has recently made a scattering of new investments. In 2018 it bought a stake in California-based Alta Motors, a maker of electric-powered dirt bikes and motorcycles. Harley said at the time that the investment would help it as it readies for the debut of a new electric motorbike this year. “We’ve said previously that we believe electric vehicles are where global mobility is headed and they hold great appeal for existing riders as well as opportunity to build new riders,” said Heather Malenshek, Harley’s senior vice-president of marketing and brand.The shift away from traditional petrol-powered vehicles comes as Harley struggles to bolster sales of its flagship motorbikes, which start at $6,899 but can cost upwards of $40,000 for top-of-the-line models. Last year it reported a 6 per cent drop in motorcycle shipments, led by a 10 per cent decline in the US, its largest market. That followed a 7 per cent global decline in 2017.Complicating matters for the company was last year’s political dispute over tariffs, which Harley was drawn into after it said it would move production of some of its motorcycles bound for Europe out of the US. Its decision drew a rebuke from US President Donald Trump, who likened the move to waving the “white flag”. New tariffs are expected to cost Harley up to $120m in 2019, the company said in January when it reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings.In a bid to shift its traditionally masculine image and appeal to a wider customer base, the company has in recent years pushed to reach women and has introduced smaller and more affordable bikes, albeit with mixed success. Harley also opened nearly two dozen stores last year that sell branded sweatshirts and jeans, which chief executive Matt Levatich told analysts and investors in January was “one of the first and easiest ways people ‘try us on’ and begin their journey with us”. The acquisition of StaCyc fits that mould.Harley shares were little changed on Tuesday at $37.52, giving the manufacturer a market value of $6bn. The stock remains roughly 50 per cent below a post-financial crisis high set in 2014.
5;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2019-01-29T18:30:52Z;Harley-Davidson sees $120m hit from tariffs this year;Motorcycle maker’s shares fall on disappointing outlook;New tariffs around the world helped wipe out profits at Harley-Davidson in the final quarter of last year and are expected to cost it up to $120m this year, as the US motorcycle maker becomes one of the highest-profile victims of escalating trade disputes.Harley set out the costs of new tariffs in Europe, China and the US on Tuesday as it reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings and forecast lower than expected shipments for 2019, sending its shares down 7 per cent by midday in New York.It said it planned to minimise the impact of those tariffs by using its plant in Thailand to serve the European and Chinese markets.As an iconic American brand, Harley-Davidson was made a target for tariffs by China and the EU in retaliation for levies introduced by President Donald Trump. It has also been hit by some of the tariffs imposed by the US, which have increased the costs of components and materials that it imports.The company faces tariffs of 25 per cent in the EU and China, and 10-25 per cent on some of the components it imports into the US.Those tariffs around the world cost it about $13m in the fourth quarter, Harley said. Along with restructuring costs of about $23m, that meant the company reported net income of just $495,000 for the quarter.John Olin, chief financial officer, told analysts on a call that the company expected additional tariff costs on its exports and imports to be approximately $100m-$120m this year, equivalent to about a fifth of the $531m net income it reported for 2018.That impact is on top of the effect of the Trump administration’s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Harley’s raw materials costs were up $17m last year, and Mr Olin said “the primary driver of that was the tariffs”.He added that Harley intended to “mitigate” the impact of the European and Chinese tariffs by the end of the year.The company’s new plant in Thailand, heavily criticised by Mr Trump, opened in the third quarter of last year. Mr Olin said that the group intended to “utilise it to make more of our product”, targeting international markets including China, following a plan set out in 2017, before the latest round of tariffs had hit.He said: “We expect to be producing the majority of our motorcycles for the EU, China and Asian markets [in Thailand] by the end of this year.” As a result, he added, the cost of tariffs should be much lower in 2020.In 2018 the group sold 228,051 bikes worldwide, a 6.1 per cent drop from 2017.Harley projected that it would ship 217,000-222,000 motorbikes this year, representing a further fall of up to-5 per cent. That forecast was below the 228,190 shipments expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix, according to Reuters.“Our initial impression of Harley-Davidson fourth-quarter results was disappointing, underwhelming outlook for ’19 motorcycle shipments,” said analysts at Stifel.Matt Levatich, Harley’s chief executive, said: “The challenges we experienced during the year reinforced the commitment we have for our More Roads to Harley-Davidson accelerated plan for growth . . . New and different people, riders and non-riders, are taking notice of Harley-Davidson and the thrill of riding.”
6;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2018-07-24T19:15:15Z;US tariffs: tale of two countries;Companies that avoid global supply chains are in fine shape;Sometime presidential candidate John Edwards campaigned as the antidote to “two Americas”: one where the privileged prosper and another where everyone else struggles. There may be two corporate Americas now. One for technology companies built on human capital and digital commerce. And the rest that cannot avert the messiness of global supply chains caught in the crossfire of protectionism and creeping input costs.Late on Monday, Alphabet shrugged off the large EU fine of last week and reported a jump in revenue of 25 per cent, the biggest gain in four years. Its stock hit a record high on Tuesday, a sign that encroaching regulation does not seem to stop its market share gains in digital advertising.It is a different story for America’s industrial stalwarts. Whirlpool, the appliance company, missed earnings targets on Monday. It cited steel costs that had reached “unexplainable” levels, driven in part by the new steel tariff policy. Whirlpool, importantly, also cited increasing oil prices that have made both resin costs and freight transport pricier.Volatile costs give industrial companies at least a partial pass for weak second-quarter earnings. But their underlying business challenges still deserve scrutiny. Harley-Davidson is facing a $2,200 per bike retaliatory tariff from the EU that it has said it will absorb. However, Europe is only now a crucial battleground for the company because its core North American customer is ageing and replacement domestic demand has not developed.US tariff policies are a worsening muddle. Winners and losers are randomly distributed. President Donald Trump’s tariff exemption and waiver policy is equally haphazard. On Tuesday, reports emerged that the US would, remarkably, spend billions in direct aid to farmers hurt by the trade war. There is perhaps a third corporate America: the US of tariff victims with helpful political connections.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
7;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2018-07-24T10:59:44Z;Harley-Davidson warns of bigger hit from tariffs;Motorcycle maker cuts margin forecast as result of trade spat between US and EU;"Harley-Davidson cut its profit margin forecast for the year as the motorcycle maker, caught in the crossfire of the US-EU trade war, said it expected tariffs to hit its business harder than previously thought.Margins on the brand’s motorcycles were now expected to be 9 per cent to 10 per cent “given the expected impact of tariffs in 2018”, Harley said on Tuesday. The company put the 2018 cost of the tariffs at between $45m and $50m but said it hoped to take steps to reduce manufacturing expenses and adjust supply-chain logistics to compensate for about half that extra cost. “We are working with the [Trump] administration, with all the governments we can, to get these tariffs removed,” said Matt Levatich, president and chief executive. “We are very engaged; there is constant dialogue.”The warning came despite strong results from the group, which cheered investors and sent shares 8 per cent higher in early afternoon trading. Harley vowed to maintain its forecast for global shipments for 2018 at between 231,000 and 236,000. The group’s second-quarter earnings per share came in well above market consensus at $1.45, compared with the year ago figure of $1.48.“Our manufacturing optimisation, demand-driving investments and commitment to manage supply in line with demand remain on target and continue to strengthen our business,” said Mr Levatich.Harley was targeted by the European Commission in June, along with other high-profile US products such as Levi’s jeans and bourbon whiskey, after President Donald Trump introduced tariffs on steel and aluminium. The motorcycle maker announced it would shift some production of EU-destined models from the US to other international plants as a result, invoking the ire of Mr Trump on Twitter. Harley sold 6 per cent fewer motorcycles in its core US market in the second quarter of 2018 compared with the same period last year, the sixth consecutive quarter of declining US sales.The decline reflects the fact that Harley riders in the US — many of whom are Trump voters — are ageing, depressing demand at home. The company said its research had shown that the tariff issue — including Mr Trump’s attacks on the company for moving jobs overseas — had led to “no discernible shift” in US sales or attitude to the brand.“European ridership is key to the global strategy,” said Craig Kennison, a Baird analyst. “Harley sold nearly 95,000 bikes outside the US last year, 39 per cent of bikes sold. Down the road, Harley would like international markets to represent half the business.”In May, the company said it expected margins as a percentage of revenues to be between 9.5 per cent and 10.5 per cent, already down 2-3 percentage points from 2017 because of plans to overhaul its factory production.The company said it would “share plans to accelerate its strategy to build the next generation of riders globally” on July 30. Over the first half-year, US sales were almost 9 per cent lower, compared with a 0.5 per cent rise internationally — although that concealed a 7 per cent decline in Asia-Pacific and 5 per cent fall in Canada. Profits for the quarter across the group fell year-on-year as sales shrunk, with net income of $242m down from $259m, and revenues of $1.71bn down from $1.77bn a year ago."
8;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2018-06-29T12:26:55Z;Harley-Davidson boss drives Donald Trump into a fury;Plan to move motorcycle production out of the US sparks political backlash;As an off-road motorcycle enthusiast, Matt Levatich is used to rough rides.When testing Harley-Davidson’s first electric bike, he nearly flew off the course after misjudging his speed going over the top of a hill.This week, the boss of the emblematic motorcycle group hit another bumpy patch — but not because of dirt tracks.This time it was trade wars after Harley was targeted by the European Commission as well as other quintessential US groups such as bourbon whiskey and Levi’s jeans in retaliation against Donald Trump’s levies on imported steel and aluminium.As a result, the company announced it would shift production of Europe-bound motorcycles to factories outside the US to avoid paying EU tariffs.Much like the guttural tone of one of its Twin Cam engines roaring into action, this kicked into spluttering like the fury of the US president, who was previously photographed shaking hands with Mr Levatich over a bike in front of the White House.“Trump held him up like a prize pony, then the prize pony turns round and bites him,” said one person who works with Harley.A series of Twitter outbursts from Mr Trump promised retribution. “If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end — they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!” he wrote.Much like bouncing off the crest of the dirt hill, Mr Levatich — a process-driven engineer by training — may have misjudged the political reaction.Many of Harley’s own employees, interviewed this week in the Financial Times, said they supported Mr Trump’s policies. “It’s a very blue-collar, very American, culture,” said one former director.“Sales to the police and military is a huge part of Harley’s business, and anything that paints them as un-American would worry them.”But the move was necessary to rebalance the company.Harley’s traditional buyers are getting older, while the US bike market, the beating heart of the company, is in decline.Profits and shipments fell last year and shares have fallen by a quarter in the past 12 months.Growth internationally is challenging.Although two-wheel vehicles are increasingly popular in Asia — Vietnam has 42m registered bikes, against 8m in the US — buyers favour cheaper, simpler rides than thundering American metal.Back at home, older riders selling their bikes has flooded the second hand market, providing new competition in the form of used Harley-Davidsons.But perhaps the company’s main problem is not convincing bikers to buy its products but in converting non-bikers, especially millennials, to the freedom of life on two wheels.Even Mr Levatich’s eldest son only learnt to ride following pressure from his Japanese college roommate.Harley has begun offering riding classes at dealerships, with the aim of “growing” riders who may then buy its products.But watching the stock slide raises the question whether Levatich — a 53-year-old dyed-in-the-denim biker whose daily work uniform is biker boots, jeans and flannel — is the right evangelist for the new era.After an engineering degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York and stints in manufacturing consultancy, he joined the company in 1994, working his way up to become chief executive in 2015.When visiting dealers overseas, he often sets out with just his bike and a backpack, spending several days on the road without the usual entourage that accompanies travelling CEOs.“The dealers love him, because he’s a biker,” said one former director.He tinkers in his garage at weekends and owns four Harleys.“At its heart, Harley is a lifestyle brand,” said another person who knows him. “You will get sussed out straight away if you’re not genuine — and he is.”A sticker on his computer at Harley’s headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, says, “Ride Every Day” — an unofficial company policy imposed after he noticed a declining number of bikes in the parking lot.But as Harley steers towards the future, it will take all his considerable biking balance to keep the icon on the right track.
9;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
10;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2018-06-28T03:00:30Z;Foxconn tells the story Trump wants US to hear;Manufacturer’s Wisconsin project is President’s good news counterpoint to Harley;"When Foxconn breaks ground on Thursday on a $10bn LCD manufacturing complex in Wisconsin, President Donald Trump will be there to claim credit for securing the Taiwanese group’s promise to deliver 13,000 jobs.But while Mr Trump helps Foxconn celebrate in Racine county, Wisconsin — a key swing district that helped him win the presidency in 2016 — just up the road at Harley-Davidson, executives will be figuring out who will lose their jobs, after the company said it must offshore production to battle retaliatory EU trade tariffs.That landed Harley in the presidential doghouse. In a series of early morning tweets on Tuesday, Mr Trump lashed out at the company, gleefully forecasting more offshoring will be the “beginning of the end” for the iconic American brand.But Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer and a key supplier to Apple, was sending exactly the message that Mr Trump wanted to deliver, with its vote of confidence in US manufacturing, and in Wisconsin, part of the industrial heartland that Mr Trump had promised to save. So the timing could not be better for an event focused on the jobs story that Mr Trump wanted to tell: a $10bn deal that he brokered, with the not insignificant help of $3bn in state aid and a further $1bn in local incentives and highway funding. The project is controversial. Proponents claim it will jump-start the modernisation of an area hit hard by globalisation, while also creating tens of thousands of new jobs in construction and knock-on industries, on top of the 13,000 promised by Foxconn.Critics said Wisconsin offered too much state money to land the project. They also claimed the scheme was an environmental threat, although Foxconn last week announced a water recycling plan that could defuse some of that opposition. And a small number of landowners are still refusing to sell their homes for the project, although the local village has threatened to take them by eminent domain if necessary, raising the risk of protracted litigation. Sceptics also point to a promised $30m Foxconn factory in Pennsylvania that never got built.“I don’t think it will fail to happen like in Pennsylvania” said Matt Montemurro, president of the local chamber of commerce, the Racine Area Manufacturers and Commerce. “We are down the road far enough now.”Mr Trump plans to hold a fundraising breakfast on the fringes of the event, after blitzing his followers with emails urging them to pay for the equivalent of online raffle tickets for the chance to break bread with the president.Only a few hundred Foxconn jobs are on the horizon so far. Construction is just getting under way on the 1,000 acre advanced manufacturing facility, which the Taiwanese company hopes will one day anchor a Silicon Valley-style high technology centre in the heart of the Rust Belt Midwest. But with over $100m in construction contracts recently awarded, jobs in the construction trades will start opening up soon; the company and the state are forecasting 16,000 temporary jobs will be created building the facility.“Foxconn will serve as a magnet for talent,” said Jenny Trick, director of the Racine County Economic Development Corporation, which beat nearby Kenosha county in bidding for the deal. And the boost in construction work was already good news, said local resident Tim Price, who works in construction — even though his house was commandeered for the development. Mr Price sold his three-year-old home for 40 per cent over the appraised price to make way for Foxconn. “He’s a guy that can make deals,” he said of the president, as he gazed across the fields to where yellow construction machines are just visible on the horizon, breaking ground for Foxconn. He voted for Mr Trump in 2016 and plans to do so again in 2020. Louis Woo, special adviser to Foxconn founder and chief executive Terry Gou, said trade friction was a driving force behind the company’s decision to set up in Wisconsin, which was made before Mr Trump launched his current trade campaign. “That’s one of the reasons why we are here, because of the escalation of the trade dispute between the two biggest trading partners (US and China)”, he told the Financial Times in an interview. He forecast a happy ending to the current friction though: referring to the leaders of China and the US, he said “I believe they have somehow struck a friendship at a level of trust, in just a matter of time they will come to an agreement on how to solve this issue”.Supply of skilled labour for the plant could be a tougher nut to crack. Labour is tight in the surrounding area, as it is in much of the Midwest, and the kind of high-tech skills Foxconn needs are in short supply. But Mr Woo says Foxconn is “not just building a factory, it’s building an ecosystem to encourage start-ups”, adding “we want to build an ecosystem to rival that of Silicon Valley, so the young generation of talent, instead of going to west or east coast, stays in the Midwest or even comes to the Midwest”."

Those measures were imposed by the EU last week against $3.3bn in US imports as retaliation for US steel and aluminium duties. The move by the iconic American brand, combined with a sharp fall in US equity markets on Monday due to fears of a trade war with China, served to illustrate what critics have repeatedly warned would be the economic consequences of the president’s protectionist trade policies. But in a series of morning tweets on Tuesday, the president both lashed out at Harley-Davidson and fired back at critics, reiterating threats to impose import taxes on US companies that offshore production and to raise tariffs on cars imported from Europe. “A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country — never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end — they surrendered, they quit!” Mr Trump said. “The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!”Mr Trump insisted that he was working to open up overseas markets and to get other economies, including the EU, to lower their trade barriers to US goods. “We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers, workers and companies,” he said. “We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!”While the president claimed he was already having success the reality is that most of the US’s major trading partners have chosen the same path as the EU and to retaliate rather than capitulate to the president’s strong-arm tactics. The president also referenced a much bigger fight brewing over the transatlantic trade in cars and parts, signalling again that he planned to impose tariffs on automotive imports from the EU and arguing they would balance any loss of jobs at Harley and other companies. “We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E.U. in that they have long taken advantage of the U.S. in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs,” he said. “In the end it will all even out — and it won’t take very long!”The best way to help American workers, consumers and manufacturers is to open new markets for them, not to raise barriers to our own marketAddressing reporters later on Tuesday, the president insisted that the tariffs he was imposing were prompting a surge in new investment in the US as well as bringing a new source of revenue. “Tariffs could be a very positive thing,” Mr Trump said. “You know in the old days when we had tariffs, we didn’t have income tax. When people wanted to come in, you look at the days of [President William] McKinley and some others — when people wanted to come in, they had to pay a price.”The EU’s top trade official on Tuesday said Harley-Davidson’s decision to move production was evidence that there would be “consequences” for US companies and consumers from a tit-for-tat trade war. “The consequences are that American companies and American business and American consumers . . . will react and that they will put pressure on the US administration to say ‘Hold on a minute’,” said Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU trade commissioner. Chad Bown, a former member of President Barack Obama’s council of economic advisers now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Harley-Davidson’s move was predictable and illustrated the multiple ways in which US firms were likely to be hit by the Trump trade policy and have to adapt. The Wisconsin-based motorcycle maker was facing a trifecta of trade woes, Mr Bown said, in the form of higher costs due to the president’s steel and aluminium tariffs, bearing the burden of retaliatory tariffs and also having to watch competitors such as BMW benefit from new EU trade deals that would give them an advantage in markets such as Japan. “I think we can expect to see other American companies do the same thing,” he said. “It’s just the cost of bad trade policy.”That message has been echoed increasingly loudly by members of Mr Trump’s own Republican party. Paul Ryan, the Republican House speaker who represents a Wisconsin district, reacted to the Harley decision by pointing his finger at Mr Trump’s tariffs. A spokeswoman for Mr Ryan called the move “further proof of the harm from unilateral tariffs”.“The best way to help American workers, consumers and manufacturers is to open new markets for them, not to raise barriers to our own market,” she said.Mr Trump and his supporters insist that Harley-Davidson is only using the EU tariffs as an excuse to mask a longer-term offshoring policy. The company already has overseas operations in Brazil, India and Thailand and earlier this year said it would be shifting production from Kansas to Thailand. “That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how unbalanced & unfair trade is, but we will fix it,” the president said.In another tweet, Mr Trump said he had hosted “officials” from the company, and had “chided them about tariffs in other countries, like India, being too high.” He said other companies were “coming back” to the US, and added, “Harley must know that they won’t be able to sell back into US without paying a big tax!”
12;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2018-06-26T04:36:21Z;Harley-Davidson workers back Trump despite jobs shift;Most blame only the EU as motorcycle maker moves some production away from US;It is time for a smoke break at the Harley-Davidson power-train facility in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, and the talk is all about tariffs.The men and women who build these famous American motorcycles are weighing the latest unintended consequence of Donald Trump’s presidency: the possibility they could lose their jobs because of a tit-for-tat trade war that has caught the Harley in its crossfire.The century-old Wisconsin company that Mr Trump has called “an American icon” — and which he has praised as a symbol of stubborn survival against the decline of the American Rust Belt — said on Monday that it would have to move some US production overseas to avoid EU tariffs. The motorcycle maker was the first US manufacturer to scale down domestic production in response to the levies, which were imposed as retaliation for US steel and aluminium duties.The workers gathered outside the factory gate could end up as collateral damage, but most are sticking by their man regardless. Wearing earphones draped around their necks and safety blinders on their glasses, most happily volunteer that they voted for Mr Trump and would do so again — tariffs or no tariffs.“He wouldn’t do it unless it needed to be done, he’s a very smart businessman,” said one Harley employee whose name is embroidered on his work shirt — though he asks not to be quoted by name.“I think he’s playing poker: I’ll hit you with this, you’ll hit us with that, I think this will bring them to the table — unless he’s completely crazy,” chimed in another, who also declined to be quoted on the grounds that he could get into trouble with the company for speaking out.Asked whether they blame the president or the EU for causing Harley’s offshoring decision, most say emphatically that they blame only the Europeans. “The president was just trying to save the US aluminium and steel industry,” said one approvingly.Harley-Davidson said on Monday that it maintained a “strong commitment to US-based manufacturing”, but that its facilities in India, Brazil and Thailand would increase production to avoid paying the EU tariffs that would have cost it as much as $100m.When asked whether the latest news could make him vote against Mr Trump if he runs for a second term in 2020, one worker, who gave his name only as Tod, replied: “No, I don’t think so. It’s going to take a little bit more than that. He’s doing good things. We’ll just have to see who runs on the other side, that might change my vote.”Mark, another Harley worker sitting astride his motorbike during the afternoon shift change at this plant that employs about 1,000 workers, said: “I think Harley is just using it as an excuse” to move more production overseas, after a recent decision to close the company’s Kansas City plant. “They will just blame it on Trump.”Mr Trump later appeared to echo that argument, castigating the company for using the tariffs as a pretext. “Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag,” he tweeted, highlighting the irony that such a symbol of made-in-the-USA greatness would be one of the first casualties in his trade battle.Several workers said they thought they could find other employment if they lost their Harley jobs — partly because the US economy is booming.Still, they are the last people that Mr Trump would want to hurt with his trade manoeuvring. He won the presidency in 2016 largely by winning swing states such as Wisconsin, which had not voted Republican in a presidential election in more than 30 years. And that was largely because blue-collar voters like them chose him and his promise to revive American manufacturing.Mr Trump and his party cannot afford to lose their support just ahead of midterm congressional elections that are likely to see the Democratic party working hard to get more voters to the polls.Scott Dunn, president of ACV, a hydraulic repair company located just outside the Harley plant, probably speaks for many Trump supporters in this area when he said: “I think he’s right to confront the issue” of unfair trade.Mr Trump’s backing, especially in the Midwest, has so far proved remarkably resilient. Even those who might be directly hurt by his policies are not rushing to abandon him.“He’s making changes, trying to get the country back where it needs to be,” said one Harley worker, grinding a cigarette butt into the pavement before returning to work.The details of how he does so may matter less than the mere idea that Mr Trump is trying to “make America great again”.Understanding the American psyche / From John Moore, Guildford, Surrey, UK
13;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2018-06-26T03:40:29Z;US trade envoys arrive in India in bid to resolve trade tension;New Delhi hopes to negotiate truce following tit-for-tat tariff threats;US negotiators will arrive in New Delhi today for talks after an increasingly bitter trade dispute that has threatened to disrupt the otherwise warm relationship between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Mark Linscott, assistant US trade representative, will meet Indian officials for a two-day meeting in an attempt to calm tensions that Mr Trump says is about Harley-Davidson motorcycles but experts say is more to do with milk.Last week India announced a plan to raise tariffs on 29 US imports in retaliation for Washington’s decision to include India in its list of countries covered by higher steel and aluminium duties.But India delayed rolling out the higher levies until August and removed high-powered motorcycles from its list — an issue Mr Trump had repeatedly raised in public, accusing the country of “ripping off” Harley-Davidson by imposing 50 per cent import duties on powerful motorcycles.“India is opening up a negotiating position,” said Biswajit Dhar, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru university. “It has lodged its actions via the World Trade Organization, and if the US is willing to negotiate on aluminium and steel, maybe we will withdraw what we have done.”Mr Trump and Mr Modi have forged a strong connection as two populist leaders from outside the political mainstream. The US administration also sees India as the natural counterweight to China, and wants New Delhi to play a greater role in regional politics and security.But trade has been a niggling source of tension that has been brought to the fore by Mr Trump’s decisions to raise import tariffs.The total trade in goods and services between the two countries last year was $126bn — far less than the $630bn in trade between the US and China. However, India counts the US as its biggest export destination, with a surplus of nearly $30bn.Officials on both sides say the Harley-Davidson issue is a distraction, with the company selling just 4,000 motorbikes a year in India out of 240,000 globally. The company also announced on Monday that it would shift some of its production outside of the US — including to a plant in India — in the wake of the Washington’s trade battles with Europe.But the deeper trade irritations are real. US companies say India has taken advantage of the country’s “general system of preferences” under which it can export certain items tariff-free but then levy high charges on American products, especially dairy and medical equipment.American farmers are frustrated that India charges 30-60 per cent duties on their milk products, while medical manufacturers have protested against price caps and high duties on coronary stents.The US trade representative is reviewing whether India should continue to receive the benefits of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) given its own trade policies.In a note published in April, Erland Herfindahl, the deputy assistant trade representative for the GSP, said: “India has implemented a wide array of trade barriers that create serious negative effects on US commerce.”The US has also complained about $7bn worth of Indian export subsidies, which are part of Mr Modi’s plans to boost domestic manufacturing but which Washington says violate WTO rules.India, meanwhile, says it should be exempt from the steel and aluminium tariffs given that its companies tend to make small amounts of specialised steel products that are not produced in the US.“This was uncalled for,” said Ravi Sehgal, chairman of India’s Engineering Export Promotion Council. “It triggered an unnecessary situation where egos have now flared up.”Officials in New Delhi are worried that the US could target other goods, especially pharmaceuticals, which in 2016 comprised 16 per cent of Indian exports to the country.For now, Mr Modi’s government is stressing the opportunity to negotiate a truce — and even to begin talking about a broader trade deal. But those close to the process warn that such aims are ambitious given past experience.After talks at the US-India trade policy forum last year, the office of Robert Lighthizer, US trade representative, released a terse statement.“Ambassador Lighthizer expressed concern about the $29.6bn US trade deficit with India, urging the Indian delegation to further liberalise the Indian economy to facilitate American exports,” it said. “Across many of these areas, both sides had differing views that could not be resolved immediately.”Experts warn that since that meeting last year, little has changed.“What with the current mood of the US administration, I don’t think they are going to back off,” said Prof Dhar. “This is likely to be somewhat protracted.”
14;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Body and soul, Harley leaves its mark on America;But being an exporter of Americana heritage might be why the EU has used it for retaliatory tariffs;When Michael Priem went to Harley-Davidson 18 years ago to help with its digital strategy, the motorcycle maker’s chief executive asked him a question: can you show me any other brand that has been tattooed on more people’s bodies?Sure enough, one survey found in 2004 that Harley was the brand people were most willing to have inked on their skin, beating Walt Disney, Coca-Cola and Nike by a wide margin. “That’s how passionate people are about the Harley brand,” said Mr Priem, the founder of a Minneapolis advertising company: “It’s part of their personal identity.”The brand has also become part of many Americans’ national identity. A Harley T-shirt acts as a sartorial shorthand for the country’s unique combination of liberty, patriotism and rebellion. That is no doubt why the EU has chosen to impose retaliatory tariffs on Harley motorcycles. Being “an exporter of Americana heritage” made it “a prime target”, Mr Priem noted.The Milwaukee manufacturer is no political novice: Ronald Reagan slapped tariffs on Harley’s Japanese rivals in 1983, and visited one of its plants once the company was roaring again to argue against trade wars.I’ll take the roar of 150 Harleys any day. It’s the sound of freedomIts bikes have also provided countless photo opps for politicians keen to connect with its proudly and loudly all-American riders. When Senator John McCain addressed a Harley rally before the 2008 presidential election, he noted that Barack Obama, his rival, had drawn large crowds in Berlin. “I’ll take the roar of 150 Harleys any day,” he said. “It’s the sound of freedom.”The company is pushing the same message with its newest slogan: “All for freedom. Freedom for all.” When brand agency MBLM studied the emotions brands provoked, Harley conveyed not just a sense of Americana and nostalgia but an outlaw style of independence, says managing partner Mario Natarelli.But MBLM has also seen Harley’s brand fall down its rankings in the past year, driven by younger Americans who do not feel the same affection for the company that their parents do. “This is a brand from an era of America that was something to be celebrated,” Mr Natarelli said, but “I don’t think [it] is going to gain much relevance over time”.America’s easy riders are ageing and overwhelmingly male, giving the company a demographic hill to climb. New motorcycle registrations have been falling as have its royalty revenues from licensing, even as it revved up its advertising spending. Harley is now trying to widen its appeal and investing in getting more people riding, rather than just wearing its T-shirts.European tariffs provide an unwanted headwind, and the company has responded by saying it would shift more production to facilities in India, Brazil and Thailand. Doing that without damaging its made-in-America image will not be easy.Nor will it solve a broader problem for Harley and other national icons: surveys such as the Anholt-GfK Nation Brands Index and the Edelman Trust Barometer show that “Brand America” has taken a few dents in the Trump era.Harley may not be the last flag-waving American brand to find itself paying a price for its government’s America First trade policies.andrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.com
15;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2018-06-25T21:45:21Z;US trade war with Europe revs up as Harley-Davidson shifts production;Trump expresses surprise that motorcycle maker is ‘first to wave the White Flag’;"The Trump administration’s trade war with Europe widened on Monday after Harley-Davidson announced it would move some manufacturing out of the US to avoid EU tariffs and Brussels prepared further retaliatory measures in case of new White House duties.The motorcycle maker is the first US manufacturer to scale down domestic production in response to the EU tariffs, which were imposed on Friday against $3.3bn in American imports as retaliation for US steel and aluminium duties. Harley-Davidson’s decision illustrates why many pro-trade members of President Donald Trump’s own Republican party have raised concerns about the potential economic consequences of the multiple fronts he has opened in his trade offensive.The president himself expressed surprise at the decision, in a pointed tweet later on Monday. “Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag,” he wrote. “Taxes just a Harley excuse — be patient!”Although Europe originally appeared to be collateral damage in Mr Trump’s trade battle with China, the president has in recent weeks grown more aggressive with Brussels, threatening 20 per cent tariffs on all imports of cars manufactured in the EU.Officials said the European Commission has started work on identifying a list of about €10bn in US imports to target if Mr Trump carries through with his auto threat. The total is based on the same calculations the EU used to retaliate against the steel and aluminium duties, though officials cautioned Brussels has yet agree on its measures.Financial markets on Monday were rattled by the signs of escalation in both Europe and Asia, where Mr Trump is expected to impose new restrictions on Chinese investment in sensitive American technologies.Technology shares were hit particularly hard after reports of the White House decision, which was confirmed on Monday by Steven Mnuchin, US Treasury secretary, who said the new measures would not focus just on China but on “all countries that are trying to steal our technology”. Officials said they would be published on Friday.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite suffered the worst losses among major indices, down over 2.5 per cent in afternoon New York trading. Semiconductor maker Micron Technology, which earned more than half its revenue from China last year, was among those suffering the steepest declines.Mr Trump has ordered an investigation into whether imports of cars and parts — including those from the EU, Japan, Canada and Mexico — present a threat to US national security. The transatlantic trade in passenger vehicles and parts was worth about $60bn last year. EU officials said on Monday that they had not yet decided on exactly how to retaliate to the threatened auto tariffs. But the breakdown of a G7 summit earlier this month had convinced Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and other EU leaders that they needed to stand up to Mr Trump, they said.The idea of imposing tariffs on European cars on national security grounds “is deeply offensive and it is wrong . . . and furthermore it will have very, very severe economic consequences if it were to happen”, EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in an interview last week. Harley-Davidson, which saw its shares fall more than 6 per cent after Monday’s announcement, said its facilities in India, Brazil and Thailand would increase production to avoid paying the EU tariffs that would have cost it as much as $100m. Harley said it maintained a “strong commitment to US-based manufacturing”.Although it is one of the first US companies to detail the financial impact of the escalating trade tensions, German automaker Daimler last week issued a warning that its profits would be hit by new Chinese tariffs on US imports.“Harley-Davidson believes the tremendous cost increase, if passed on to its dealers and retail customers, would have an immediate and lasting detrimental impact to its business in the region,” the group said in a regulatory filing on Monday morning. As a result, it said, it had decided to shift production rather than raise prices. The EU tariffs have pushed up the levy on Harley motorcycles exported to the EU from the US to 31 per cent from 6 per cent. Harley said it would bear the cost of this increase in the near-term, and expected to take a hit of $30m to $45m for the remainder of 2018. On a full-year basis, the aggregate annual impact of the EU tariffs would be about $90m to $100m.The company said ramping-up production at its non-US plants would require additional investment and take at least nine to 18 months to complete. The revenue Harley generates in the EU is second only to that from the US. The company sold nearly 40,000 new motorcycles there last year, amounting to about 16.5 per cent of global sales, or more than two-fifths of its sales outside the US.“Harley-Davidson’s announcement today is the latest slap in the face to the loyal, highly-skilled workforce that made Harley an iconic American brand,” said Robert Martinez Jr, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, one of Harley’s two unions.“Does Harley even understand what ‘Made in America means?”Additional reporting by Jamie Smyth in SydneyCommission gets a taste of its own medicine / From Geoffrey Van Orden MEP, Conservative Defence &amp; Security Spokesman"
16;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2018-06-22T15:49:19Z;Trump threatens 20% tariff on EU car imports;Shares of European carmakers fall on new risk of trade war following president’s tweet;Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs of 20 per cent on imports of cars from the European Union, in a further escalation of trade hostilities with key partners that hit shares of major automakers.The US president said he would act if the EU did not remove tariffs and barriers on US products soon. The scale of the levy is slightly smaller than the 25 per cent tariff on imported vehicles that was previously discussed, but it prompted a retreat in share prices of auto giants including Volkswagen and BMW. Mr Trump’s warning followed the imposition on Friday of retaliatory tariffs by the European Union on products including peanut butter, whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The EU move was prompted by the US decision to put tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and then refusing to exempt allies including the EU, Canada and Mexico. The president’s new threat comes as his administration is conducting a national security investigation into imports of cars from all over the world. Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, said on Thursday that his department expected to complete that probe by early August. The administration is said to be looking at announcing auto tariffs before November’s midterm elections in which the president is keen to position the Republican Party as tough on trade. In a Friday morning tweet, Mr Trump said: “Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U.S. and it great companies and workers by the European Union, if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!” The administration’s plans face significant pushback from Republicans in Congress. In a hearing this week, senators questioned Mr Ross pointedly about his invocation of national security in examining auto imports. He and other administration officials have said that they consider the auto industry vital to US economic security. The proposed barriers will heighten fears that the tit-for-tat escalation of trade measures will start damaging growth as well as hitting stock markets. This week central bankers including Jay Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said they were picking up increased anxiety about the trade prospects and that investment decisions were being delayed as a result. Funds invested in global equities suffered their biggest one-week outflow ever in the week ended June 20.Shares of BMW dropped 1.5 per cent following Mr Trump’s tweet, and Volkswagen and Daimler also both fell sharply before recovering some ground to trade down 0.3 per cent. The EU’s 10 per cent tariff on passenger vehicles has long been a focus of Mr Trump’s trade ire. The US charges just a 2.5 per cent duty on cars imported from Europe. The US also has a 25 per cent tariff on light trucks that has been in place since the 1960s and is the result of another trade dispute with the EU. The US imported $191bn in passenger vehicles and light trucks last year. More than $42bn in auto imports came from the EU, $20bn of that from Germany. The EU retaliatory measures against Mr Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs, which took effect on Friday, target some €2.8bn of imports from the US. The EU’s list slaps 25 per cent tariffs on dozens of US products ranging from peanut butter to pleasure boats. One product — playing cards — gets a 10 per cent tariff. Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU’s trade commissioner, said on Wednesday that “the rules of international trade, which we have developed over the years hand in hand with our American partners, cannot be violated without a reaction from our side”. She added that if the US removes its tariffs, the EU measures will also be removed. Brussels is formally challenging the US action at the WTO.The EU list is designed to inflict economic and political pain while minimising damage to European businesses and consumers. Among the targeted products are orange juice — a key export from the swing state of Florida — and bourbon whiskey, an emblematic product from Kentucky, the state represented by US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. It also targets cranberries and Harley-Davidson motorbikes from Wisconsin, the home state of House of Representatives speaker Paul Ryan.
17;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2018-04-24T13:27:08Z;Harley shares roar higher on first quarter results;;Harley-Davidson shares are all revved up this morning after the motorcycle maker delivered a better-than-forecast set of results and said it would soon reveal new steps to boost performance and shareholder value over the next five years.The Milwaukee-based manufacturer previously revealed a set of goals to be achieved by 2027, including plans to add 2m new Harley riders in the US (where sales have been declining), growing the international business to be 50 per cent of annual volume and launch new “high impact” motorcycles profitably and sustainably.The company said today it was refining plans to “deliver significant value through 2022” and intends to reveal these additional steps to improve performance over the summer.Harley reported a 2.7 per cent year-on-year rise in revenue to $1.54bn in the first three months of 2018, which came in comfortably above the median estimate of $1.23bn in a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.Net income was down 6.2 per cent from a year ago to $174.8m, but above estimates for $154.7bn.Sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the US dropped 12 per cent from a year ago to 29,309 units, while international sales outside the US grew 0.2 per cent to 21,777 units as high single-digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa and Latin America offset declines in Asia Pacific and Canada. Total worldwide sale were down 7.2 per cent.Harley maintained its full-year outlook for shipping between 231,000 and 265,000 motorcycles this year, and said it expected to ship 67,500 to 72,500 during this second quarter. It stuck with its forecasts for operating margin, manufacturing optimisation costs, capital expenditures and effective tax rates, but added it expected operating income for its financial services division would be “flat to down modestly”.Harley shares were up 6.1 per cent to $43.20 in pre-market trade.
18;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2018-01-30T14:26:45Z;Harley-Davidson sees lower 2018 bike shipments, shares sputter;;Harley-Davidson shares sputtered on Tuesday after the motorcycle maker said its shipments fell short of its own target last year and predicted a decline in 2018 as well.Harley-Davidson shares fell more than 5 per cent to $52.50 in pre-market trade after the company said its overall motorcycle shipments suffered a 7.9 per cent year-on-year decline in 2017 to 241,498 - at the low end of its earlier guidance for shipments of between 241,000 to 246,000 units.Moreover, for 2018, the Milwaukee-based company said it expects shipments to fall again. It is forecasting motorcycle shipments of between 231,000 to 236,000 or down by about 2 to 4 per cent — with about 60,000 to 65,000 of those being shipped in the first quarter.The drop in shipments came as Harley reported a 6.7 drop in global retail motorcycle sales to 241,788 last year, compared to 2016, led by an 8.5 per cent decline in the US.Harley has previously said it aims to have 2m new riders by 2027. The company which is struggling to draw in millennial consumers is targeting the electric market as it seeks to grow its customer base. Harley said on Tuesday that it remains on target to launch its first electric motorcycle in 18 months.The company also said that it would close its assembly plant in Kansas City and merge those operations into those of its plant in York, Pennsylvania, resulting in 400 net job loss.It expects to incur restructuring costs of between $170m to $200m and capital investment of about $70m over the next two years. It is also expects ongoing annual cash savings of between $65m to $75m after 2020.“Our actions to address the current environment through disciplined supply and cost management position us well as we drive to achieve our long-term objectives to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders globally,” said Matt Levatich, chief executive.In the fourth quarter, sales were down 9.6 per cent in total, with an 11.1 per cent slide in the US and a 7.7 per cent fall overseas.In the fourth quarter, net income fell to $8.3m from $47.2m in the year ago period. That translated to earnings per share of 5 cents, down 81 per cent from 27 cents in the year ago quarter.Profits were hurt by a $53.1m tax charge associated with the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a $29.4m pre-tax charge for a voluntary product recall. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 47 cents a share topped the average analyst estimate of 45 cents, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.Revenues for motorcycles and related products rose 12 per cent from a year ago to $1.05bn, just ahead of estimates.

20;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2017-12-20T19:00:28Z;Big bike industry revs up in Thailand;Thailand attracts high-end motorcycle manufacturers as domestic sales soar;In less than a decade, Thailand has gone from a marginal producer of “big bikes” — loosely defined as motorcycles over 400cc or 500cc — to a leading exporter, mirroring the country’s success as an auto manufacturing hub. Nearly all major brands now assemble in the country. Even Harley-Davidson, which has long touted its “Made in America” image, announced plans earlier this year to open a plant in Thailand.We estimate that worldwide sales of big bikes total at least $10bn a year. Entry-level models generally cost under $6,000 before tax, several times the price of an average scooter, while high-end sports bikes and cruisers can exceed $30,000. Worldwide, about 1m motorcycles over 500cc were sold last year.Approximately 115,000 motorbikes 400cc and larger were assembled in Thailand in 2016, and roughly 90,000 were exported. This year, production is on track to reach 176,000 and exports 133,000 (see chart).Thailand now accounts for about 15 per cent of global big bike manufacturing, according to our research — output worth well over $1bn. Triumph was the first manufacturer to make Thailand a key export base, launching full assembly in 2007. It produced more than 40,000 bikes in the country last year, about 80 per cent of its global sales volume. Honda has relocated assembly for most of its under-700cc motorbikes from Japan to Thailand, where it produces 16 models for global export. Ducati’s latest plant expansion doubled capacity to 20,000 units a year.Major brands continue to introduce new Thailand-produced models. In November Ducati said its new flagship bike, the Panigale V4 “superbike”, would be assembled in Rayong for delivery to Asian markets.The rush of manufacturers into Thailand can be attributed to three complementary factors: investment incentives, market access, and the country’s strength as a vehicle production base.In 2012, Thailand’s Board of Investment (BOI) issued a package of incentives for the manufacture of motorbikes of at least 500cc, and expanded this to bikes over 250cc in 2013. The benefits include tax-free import of machinery, unrestricted foreign ownership and corporate tax holidays for engine manufacturing. The BOI also negotiated directly with Triumph and Ducati to win their pre-2012 investments.The government has recently signalled continued support for motorbikes and cars with a Bt3.7bn ($111.8m) vehicle R&D testing centre and proving ground currently under construction.The second reason manufacturers are expanding in Thailand is to avoid import tariffs and gain competitive access to both the domestic market and others linked to the country by free trade agreements, including the rest of Asean. Vehicle import duties in Asean are extremely high: Thailand has a 60% tariff on imported motorbikes and rates can exceed 100% in other countries. This makes bikes from Europe and the US, which have no relevant trade agreement with Asean, extremely uncompetitive.A Ducati executive told FTCR that tariffs, rather than production costs, were the main reason for expanding production in Thailand. Harley-Davidson similarly cited trade barriers as its motive for opening a plant there. Although Japanese manufacturers can now export to Thailand without tariffs under a bilateral free trade agreement, exporting from Thailand still reduces trade barriers to some markets.Third, Thailand’s manufacturing “super cluster” on the eastern seaboard is a highly competitive production base for vehicles and related components. Ducati said the supply chain and quality of labour make Thailand an ideal export base. According to the BOI, Honda invested in big bike production in Thailand in part because as much as 95 per cent of parts for each model can be sourced locally.Strong demand for higher-end motorbikes in Thailand has both driven the production boom and been fuelled by it. A growing domestic market makes it more attractive to produce in the country, particularly for European and American brands subject to full import tariffs. As manufacturers make Thailand an export base, they can also offer bikes to the local market at attractive prices. We estimate that Thailand now accounts for approximately 3 per cent of the global big bike market, and is likely to reach about 5 per cent in five years, based on industry forecasts.In the first three quarters, new registrations of over-400cc bikes hit 25,000 units — the same number as were registered in all of 2016 (see chart) — and are on pace to exceed 30,000 by the end of the year. Sales are likely to quicken in the final months of the year thanks to high-profile motor exhibitions and the launch of 2018 models.A Honda representative told FTCR that the company expected its big bike sales to rise 10 to 15 per cent in Thailand next year, and for the entire market to expand at about 10 per cent a year over the next five years. Ducati similarly predicts about 10 per cent growth in domestic sales next year. BMW was more cautious, forecasting single-digit growth with the possibility of an upside surprise.Before 2012, most big bikes were imported and sold for premium prices (many for over Bt1m) due to high import duties and hefty mark-ups reflecting a low-volume market of a few thousand sales per year. This rapidly changed in 2012 and 2013 as Ducati, Honda and Kawasaki launched locally assembled models costing 200,000 to 400,000 baht, giving many aspiring riders an affordable entry into the segment. Sales doubled between 2012 and 2013 and have grown strongly since.These brands and others have aggressively expanded their distribution channels. Honda, the market leader by units sold, had only three showrooms nationwide in 2013 but now has 20, one in almost every second-tier city.Two other factors support a rosy outlook. First, top brands are planning to streamline the second-hand market. This will bring first-time riders into the segment and make it easier for existing owners to resell when they upgrade. BMW will launch a pre-owned programme and trade-in scheme, and Ducati and Honda have indicated similar plans.Second, there is a swiftly growing market for “mid-size” bikes in the 250cc to 500cc range in Thailand. Total sales in this segment reached 25,000 last year, according to an industry source, about the same as the above-400cc segment. Bikes in this category are relatively affordable and easy to ride, attracting new riders who will later upgrade to more expensive machines.

In the current quarter, it also expects shipments to be down 10 to 20 per cent from a year ago.Shares in the company fell 5.9 per cent to $48.95 by the close of trading.Second-quarter revenue decreased 5.6 per cent to $1.58bn, compared with Wall Street estimates of $1.6bn. Investors were also disappointed after Harley said US retail motorcycle sales were down 9.3 per cent from a year ago.“We believe soft, used motorcycle prices adversely affected the industry new motorcycle sales in the quarter,” said chief financial officer John Olin on an earnings call. The used motorcycle market could pose a challenge for the company to meet its goal of adding 2m riders in the US by 2027.However, while, profits slid to $258.9m, or $1.48 a share, compared with $280.4m, or $1.55 a share, in the year ago period, they topped analysts’ expectations of $1.39 a share.The slump in Harley shares came alongside mixed trading for Wall Street. The S&P 500 gained less than 0.1 per cent to 2,460.61, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.3 per cent to 21,574.73 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent higher at 6,344.31.Financials were among the worst performing sectors, off 0.3 per cent following poorly received results from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. A Republican move to abandon their efforts to replace Obamacare also renewed investor concerns about President Donald Trump’s ability to deliver on his economic agenda.Elsewhere, investors also soured on Chipotle after the burrito chain said it temporarily closed one of its restaurants following reports that customers fell ill after eating there, reigniting memories of a painful food-safety scare in 2015.Jim Marsden, the group’s food safety chief, said that Chipotle was working with local health authorities to “understand what the cause may be and to resolve the situation as quickly as possible”.He added that the symptoms were consistent with a highly contagious illness called norovirus. The infection is generally spread through food, water or touching contaminated surfaces, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It causes unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms, ranging from stomach pain to diarrhoea and vomiting.“Norovirus does not come from our food supply, and it is safe to eat at Chipotle. We plan to reopen the restaurant today,” Mr Marsden said.For investors, the incident hearkens back to the crisis the company faced in 2015 when a series of at least six outbreaks were thought to have caused sickness in 485 people across 13 US states.Chipotle shares dropped 4.3 per cent to $374.98 on Tuesday. They have yet to recover even close to the record closing high of $757.77 they struck in August 2015.
22;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Harley-Davidson shares poised for worst day in more than a year;;Harley-Davidson shares were on track for their biggest one-day drop in more than a year after the motorcycle maker issued downbeat outlook and posted disappointing US sales in the second quarter.Shares in the Milwaukee-based company fell 9.7 per cent to $46.94 after it said it now expects ship 241,000 to 246,000 motorcycles to dealers worldwide this year, down between 6 to 8 per cent from a year ago. That compared to its previous outlook for shipments to be flat to “down modestly”.Moreover, in the current quarter it expects shipments to be down between 10 to 20 per cent from a year ago.That accompanied a 5.6 per cent drop in second quarter revenue to $1.58bn, compared with Wall Street estimates of $1.6bn. Investors were also disappointed after Harley said retail motorcycle sales in the US were down 9.3 per cent from a year ago. That followed a 5.7 per cent decline in the previous quarter and came despite a much easier comparison in the second quarter of 2016, analysts noted.“We believe soft, used motorcycle prices adversely affected the industry new motorcycle sales in the quarter,” John Olin, chief financial officer at Harley said on the earnings call.However, while, profits slid to $258.9m or $1.48 a share, compared with $280.4m or $1.55 a share in the year ago period, it topped analysts’ expectations of $1.39 a share.With Tuesday’s decline, Harley shares are down more than 19 per cent so far this year.
23;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2017-06-23T14:31:02Z;Harley/Ducati: not such an easy rider;Buying the Italian racer would be a stretch for the US brand;"A man who comes of age sells the motorbike in favour of a sensible family car. Reports suggest that Volkswagen is preparing to do likewise by offloading Ducati, the Italian motorcycle maker it acquired in 2012 during its empire-building days.This seems rational. Ducati’s €550m of revenues are trifling in the group context, or for that matter next to BMW’s €2bn of annual motorbike sales. There is little industrial synergy between motorcycles and cars. Selling Ducati would send a signal that Volkswagen is focusing on rehabilitation.The 2016 flotation of Ferrari has also reset the valuation bar for trophy automotive assets. At more than 4 times sales, the Italian supercar company is priced more like a luxury goods group than a carmaker. VW might fancy that Ducati, another brand with racing heritage, will also attract a rich multiple and a €1.5bn price tag.It is less obvious who might buy it. Ducati has had multiple private equity owners already. They have struggled to make small-volume manufacturing work financially. Another rumoured buyer is Harley-Davidson, the US maker of throbbing cruisers.Harley is trying to reduce its dependence on the hairy old American bikers of stereotype, and increase its non-US sales. Ducati would do that at a stroke; its race pedigree appeals to younger riders. And Harley could apply its branding expertise; its own sales of “general merchandise” amounted to $285m last year.But buying Ducati at the kind of price VW has in mind looks a stretch. Harley has a substantial financing business that needs a strong credit rating to keep its funding costs down. Loading up on debt might imperil that. VW is unlikely to want Harley’s US-listed shares in payment and a public share issue would be dilutive.VW may yet have to compromise on price — or keep its outrageously powerful superbikes in the garage.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
24;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2017-04-18T20:13:25Z;Harley-Davidson shares skid after sales miss;Motorbike maker’s weakness accelerates S&P 500 sell-off;Harley-Davidson shares were among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 on Tuesday after the maker of motorcycles recorded weak retail bike sales in the first quarter.Shares in the Milwaukee-based company fell 4.2 per cent to $56.91, taking the company’s year-to-date losses to 2.5 per cent. Harley said global retail sales, which represent sales from dealers to the final consumer, fell 4.2 per cent from a year ago — against Wall Street’s estimates of a 1.7 per cent rise. While sales in Latin America were strong, those in the US dropped 5.7 per cent from a year ago — against consensus estimates of 2.4 per cent growth — partly influenced by its decision to reduce shipments of model year 2017 motorcycles.Analysts at Morgan Stanley noted that the weakness in retail bike sales arrived despite strong economic and credit conditions and noted that it was unclear if delayed tax returns could have influenced results.“We don’t think the market likes this number very much, leaving a high cash generating franchise butting up against fundamental/leveraged buyout value,” said the bank.Harley’s net income slid to $186.4m in the first quarter from $250.5m a year ago, while earnings per share fell 22.8 per cent to $1.05 — but topped analysts’ estimates of $1.02. Revenues from motorcycles and related products fell nearly 16 per cent to $1.3bn, short of analysts’ expectations.The company also unveiled a long-term strategy to build 2m new Harley riders in the US by 2027 and grow international businesses to half of its annual motorcycle volume over the same period. Harley-Davidson also said it aims to launch 100 new, high-impact motorcycles over the next decade.The decline in Harley shares accompanied a sell-off on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent to 2,342.19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.6 per cent to 20,523.28 with a 4.7 per cent drop in shares of Goldman Sachs weighing on the price-weighted index. The Nasdaq Composite was off by 0.1 per cent to 5,849.47.Elsewhere, WW Grainger sounded an ominous start to the earnings season for industrial stocks after the supplier of maintenance and repair equipment cut its full year sales and earnings forecasts.The $12bn distributor of industrial parts said it now expects sales to grow between 1-4 per cent and a range of $10 to $11.30 in 2017 for earnings per share as its campaign of aggressive discounting erodes profitability. The group had previously forecast sales growth of 2 to 6 per cent and earnings per share of $11.30 to $12.40.Shares in the company tumbled 11.4 per cent to $197.57.For the three months to end of March, net sales rose just 1.3 per cent to $2.54bn, just shy of the $2.56bn the market was expecting. Net income meanwhile fell to $173.3m, compared to the $184.9m recorded in the prior year period. Adjusted net income of $171.6m, or $2.88 per diluted share, also came in below forecasts of $177.1m or $2.99 a share.“Overall, the first quarter clearly fell short of our expectations, driven primarily by the stronger than anticipated customer response to our US strategic pricing actions, with a greater volume of products sold at more competitive prices,” said chief executive DG Macpherson.
25;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2016-10-18T12:30:48Z;Harley-Davidson earnings hit by weak US sales;;"Harley Davidson, the iconic motorcycle maker, said on Tuesday it planned to “steamline” its business later this year after a steep drop off in demand in its all important US market dragged third quarter earnings sharply lower.Sales volume in the US, where about three-quarters of its motorcycles are shipped, were down 7.1 per cent for the three months to September 25. This in turn weighed on total group revenue, which fell 4.3 per cent to $1.1bn during the period.“We continue to effectively navigate a fiercely competitive environment and an
ongoing weak U.S. industry,” said chief executive Matt Levatich.Net income fell nearly 19 per cent to $114.1m, compared to the prior year period. That’s a steeper drop than the $115.5m the market was expecting.Earnings per share however fell by a smaller margin to 64 cents a share, compared to 69 cents last year after the company bought back over 2m shares from investors during the quarter.While the Wisconsin-based company kept its target of shipping 264,000 to 269,000 bikes this year, it acknowledged the tough trading conditions in the US and said it planned to streamline its operations in the fourth quarter of 2016.It expects to incur expenses of approximately $20m to $25m in the fourth quarter, primarily for employee separation and reorganization costs.Shares were mostly unchanged in pre-market trading on Tuesday."
26;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2016-08-18T20:54:07Z;US energy stocks a bright spot for equity investors;Rising oil price supports the sector as cyclicals are favoured over defensive shares;US energy groups remained a bright spot on Thursday for investors in what has otherwise been a lacklustre week for Wall Street as the rally in crude oil gathers pace.The S&P 500 energy sector has climbed 2.8 per cent over the past four days, for a gain of 4 per cent during August, handily outperforming the broad market.While energy has led the market, investors have this month also sought technology and financials, while selling the high-dividend paying stocks within the utilities and telecoms sectors.The advance in energy shares on Thursday came as the price of West Texas Intermediate, the US oil marker, climbed $3.81 to $48.28 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, advanced beyond the $50 threshold on Thursday for the first time since July 5. It gained $3.90 to $50.86.The oil price has been supported by several factors, including bullish weekly inventory data released on Wednesday by the US energy department, a weakening US dollar and renewed talk over a potential Opec production freeze.The gains for energy groups this week are broad, with 35 of 37 stocks in the S&P 500 energy index in the black. Among the sharpest risers have been Marathon Oil, an exploration and production group, up 13.3 per cent to $16.68. Halliburton, a large oilfield services company, has risen 6 per cent to $46.46, while integrated energy group ExxonMobil has ticked up 1.2 per cent to $88.91.Elsewhere, the shares of Harley-Davidson fluctuated after the group was accused by the US Environmental Protection Agency of selling after-market devices that circumvent emissions checks built into its motorcycles’ engines.Harley allegedly sold almost 340,000 Screamin’ Eagle engine tuners from 2008 to 2015 that boost the power of the motorcycles’ engines, but that also bypass “a device or element of design installed on the motorcycles in compliance with applicable regulations”, according to a complaint filed in federal court in Washington.The company contended in a statement that the products were “intended for off-road and closed-course competition” and not for use on public roads as the US alleged.Still, it said on Thursday morning that it forged a settlement with the US where it would “no longer sell its competition-only tuner in the US”, but would continue to sell a performance tuner “designed to ensure Harley-Davidson motorcycles retain 50-state and EPA on-road emissions compliance”. It will also pay a $12m civil penalty.Harley added that “this settlement is not an admission of liability but instead represents a good faith compromise with the EPA on areas of law we interpret differently”.Harley’s shares fell as much as 8 per cent on Thursday, but trimmed the decline to 1.7 per cent after the pact with the US was unveiled. It closed the day at $53.54.The shares of Hormel Foods, meanwhile, climbed after the group said it expected a “strong finish to fiscal 2016”.As a result, Hormel, which makes meat products, raised its earnings per share guidance for the period to $1.60-$1.64, from a previous view of $1.56-$1.60.Hormel shares rose 1.9 per cent to $37.04, reducing the year-to-date fall to 6.3 per cent.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher at 2,187, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 18,597.7, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.2 per cent to 5,240.2.

Harley-Davidson will report earnings at the end of this month.RW Baird noted the company’s strong balance sheet with only $750m of debt, excluding its financial services arm. However, RW Baird cut its rating to neutral from outperform, maintaining its target price for the stock at $54.“We have no information that would corroborate takeout speculation surrounding the company, and are aware of no credible source behind the rumour,” it said in a research note. “With shares above our fundamental price target, we would need evidence to support a takeout scenario to sustain our outperform rating here.”UBS analysts also downgraded the stock to neutral. KKR were previously rumoured to be making a bid for Harley-Davidson in 2010, which was also unconfirmed. RW Baird described the motorcycle company as “among the most valuable brands on the planet with an intensely loyal customer base”.Other big declines were concentrated in the energy sector, which fell 1.9 per cent, as Brent crude lost 4.3 per cent, to close the day at $47.96. The materials and financials sectors also lost ground, falling 1.9 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively.Among the worst performers were Southwestern Energy, which fell 10.4 per cent to $11.66, Chesapeake, which gave up 6.3 per cent to $4.30 and Marathon Oil, which lost 6.1 per cent to $14.72. Murphy Oil, which led the energy sector’s gains last Wednesday, dropped 7.9 per cent to $30.09.At the other end of the spectrum, a number of food, beverage and consumer companies led the S&P 500 index. Dr Pepper Snapple, the soft-drink maker, was the best performers on the S&P 500 — rising 1.8 per cent at $97.34, buoyed by the company’s limited exposure to Europe, good news in light of the UK’s vote to leave the EU.Campbell Soup gained 1.7 per cent to $67.19, Clorox, which manufactures cleaning products, rose 1.5 per cent to $139.24, and US supermarket operator Kroger, moved up 2.1 per cent to $37.33.Consumer staples was the second-best S&P 500 index, rising 0.5 per cent, behind utilities, which gained 0.7 per cent.On the day, the S&P 500 dipped 0.7 per cent to 2,088.6, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6 per cent to 17,840.6, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.8 per cent to 4,822.9.

All of the yardstick’s 10 industry sectors were higher on the week.On Friday consumer stocks led the pack. Netflix, the video streaming service, gained 5.7 per cent to $96.67, Amazon rose 1.4 per cent to $725.68 and Best Buy climbed 2.5 per cent to $31.36.The automotive sector also gained after carmakers reported a solid month of sales. Ford Motor added 1.2 per cent to $12.72 and General Motors rose 2.1 per cent to $28.89. BorgWarner, a car parts supplier, increased 2.6 per cent to $30.29, while AutoNation, a chain of dealerships, was up 1.8 per cent to $47.83.Harley-Davidson, the US motorcycle company, surged 19.8 per cent to $54.25 on an unconfirmed takeover rumour reported by The Fly, a financial website.Air transports also lifted off, with American Airlines up 3.6 per cent to $29.33, United Continental 0.8 per cent higher at $41.37 and Alaska Air Group up 0.8 per cent to $58.74. Cruise ship operator Carnival rose 1.5 per cent to $44.86.Industrial stocks found support in a robust reading from the Institute for Supply Management’s index of US manufacturing activity. Parker-Hannifin, an equipment supplier to mobile and aerospace industries, increased 1.2 per cent to $109.34.Materials stocks also climbed. Investors boosted Alcoa after the aluminium producer this week reiterated plans to break into a commodity business and a company producing specialised metal products, driving the shares up 3 per cent to $9.55. Albemarle, a chemicals company, rose 2.5 per cent to $81.32, while Mosaic, a potash fertiliser producer, gained 1.5 per cent to $26.57.The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent for the day to 2,102.9, nearing its all-time high of 2,134.72 reached in May 2015. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 17,949.4, and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent higher at 4,862.6.The higher index levels reflected the sharp turnround in sentiment among US equity investors after markets were shaken by the UK’s Brexit vote the previous week.Oil and natural gas producers were supported as hot summer weather forecasts suggested stronger air-conditioning demand, which feeds back to power plants that burn gas. Among the gainers in the sector were Chesapeake Energy, up 7.2 per cent to $4.59, and Southwestern Energy, up 3.4 per cent to $13.01.Healthcare stocks added to the market’s strength, helped by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, up 0.4 per cent to $349.23, and Celgene, up 2.1 per cent to $100.70.On the losing side of the ledger, chipmaker Micron Technology dropped 9.2 per cent to $12.50 after reporting poor sales and cuts to its payroll.

As a result of the weaker operating metrics, Devon was under more pressure to protect its credit rating.“Combined with other recent asset sales, we have now announced $1.3bn of gas-focused upstream divestitures,” said Dave Hager, Devon chief executive. “As we’ve said previously, proceeds from these tax-efficient transactions will be utilised to further strengthen our investment grade financial position.”The move announced on Monday included the divestiture of upstream assets in east Texas, the sale of non-core positions in the Anadarko Basin’s Granite Wash area and overriding royalty interest across 11,000 net acres in the northern Midland Basin.Devon’s shares jumped 4.7 per cent on Monday to $37.59. They are still down by about 41 per cent over the past 12 months.The broader energy sector also posted a strong performance on Monday as the price of US crude oil climbed by 2.2 per cent to $49.69, a 10-month high.Among the gainers were oilfield servicing group Halliburton, which rose 4.8 per cent to $44.91, and pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, which gained 3.2 per cent to $18.57.Elsewhere, Harley-Davidson’s shares were in the red after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the motorcycle maker to “neutral” from “buy”.“Our dealer checks over the last two weeks suggest that foot traffic has been mixed if not weak in the first two months of [the second quarter],” said Patrick Archambault, Goldman analyst.Mr Archambault also cautioned over “concerns about long-term brand relevance” and “demographic headwinds” that could weigh on the Wisconsin-based company.Harley’s shares slipped 1.6 per cent to $45.08, bringing their decline over the past 12 months to 17 per cent.Best Buy shares also fell after Hubert Joly, chief executive, said in a regulatory filing after the closing bell on Friday that he had reduced his stake in the electronics retailer by 43.8 per cent.Mr Joly sold about $12.8m worth of stock on June 2 for “diversification of his portfolio”, the regulatory filing said, adding that “he continues to exceed his officer stock ownership requirement with holdings of approximately $40m in vested and unvested [Best Buy] shares, stock units and options”.Best Buy shares fell 3.2 per cent to $31.33.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had gained 0.5 per cent to 2,109.4, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.6 per cent to 17,920.3, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5 per cent to 4,968.7.The energy and materials sectors led the way higher while the utilities sector lagged behind.

The most recoveries were also made in warmer months and in California.And for those in the market for bikes this year, here’s what thieves have their eyes on. Honda motorcycles were the most stolen and recovered, with 8.674 thefts and just 3,352 recovered. Meanwhile, just 348 Triumph motorcycles were stolen and of those 204 were recovered.Harley Davidson bikes were the fifth most stolen and most recovered, with 4,416 bikes purloined and just 1,412 making it back to their owners.

They jumped 4.3 per cent to $46.85 on Wednesday.Elsewhere, the S&P 500 financial sector rallied 2.3 per cent after JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, disclosed a slimmer-than-feared decline in its first-quarter profits.The New York-based lender said its net income fell to $5.5bn, or $1.35 a share, from $5.9bn, or $1.45 a share, in the same period in 2015. Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.24 a share.The news sent the New York-based company’s shares up 4.2 per cent to $61.79. Other big banks climbed as well: Bank of America rose 3.6 per cent to $13.75, Wells Fargo advanced 2.7 per cent to $49.05 and Citigroup climbed 5.7 per cent to $44.27.The gains came despite US regulators objecting to the so-called “living wills” of several US lenders, including JPMorgan, BofA and Wells Fargo.Banks have had a tough year amid concerns that a reduction in the Federal Reserve’s rate rise plans may put a pressure on lenders’ margins.Potential credit losses stemming from the energy sector have also been a lingering worry.CSX also rose after its posted first-quarter profits that matched Wall Street’s expectations. The railway operator said its earnings declined 19.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $356m.The fall came amid “ongoing coal headwinds”, said chief executive Michael Ward. Indeed, US coal railway traffic plummeted 35.9 per cent in March from the same month in 2015, according to the Association of American Railroads.The decline was kept in check, however, by a 12 per cent fall in expenses as CSX “reduced its cost structure in the face of the challenging market environment” and benefited from low fuel prices.The stock rose 4.2 per cent on Wednesday, cutting its 12-month decline to 22.9 per cent.The S&P 500 climbed 1 per cent to 2,082.42, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.1 per cent to 17,908.28 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6 per cent to 4,947.42.The advance on Wall Street came amid a global rally sparked by upbeat trade data from China, Asia’s biggest economy. The better than expected JPMorgan earnings also provided a bullish jolt to the markets.Financial, technology and consumer discretionary stocks posted the biggest gains. Meanwhile, utilities, telecommunications and consumer staples all declined.The article has been corrected to reflect Robin Farley was wrongly referred to as Mr.
32;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2016-01-06T01:12:23Z;Issuers raise $15.8bn in first test of 2016 bond market;Disney, Ford and Citigroup among first companies to sell new bond offerings;US and European companies raised $15.8bn on Tuesday, in the first test of US capital markets since the start of the year after turbulence in Chinese financial markets kept the primary market shuttered on Monday.Eight companies and banks waded into the market with new bond offerings, in the new year’s first bout of US issuance.Offerings included multibillion dollar deals from Walt Disney, Ford Motor Credit, Citigroup, Santander UK and Barclays and represented the busiest day in nearly a month, since Visa sold $16bn of debt at the start of December.The sell-off in Chinese equity markets— triggered by lacklustre manufacturing data — spilled over to global bourses on Monday, with benchmark equity indices in the US and Europe sliding as concerns over the country’s economy resurfaced.“China clearly affected the market in terms of access for issuers, but what you saw through the course of [Monday] was the credit market outperforming equities,” said Todd Mahoney, head of fixed income syndicate in the Americas for UBS. “It gave issuers the confidence to test the market despite another day when equity futures were down.”Companies’ gradual return to the market underscored investor reticence after a challenging 2015, when investment grade US corporate bonds slid 0.7 per cent, according to Barclays Indices.Analysts and bankers on Tuesday said that they nonetheless expected rising yields on high-grade corporate debt to attract portfolio managers to new transactions in the coming weeks, despite recent outflows.Strategists with Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimate that the US high-grade market now accounts for three quarters of global corporate yield income, up from half in 2011. Yields on high-grade debt have climbed to 3.66 per cent, up from 2.84 per cent last April.The deals on Tuesday included a $3bn offering from Disney across five tranches, which ranged from three to 30 years in maturity.The entertainment company behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens offered $1bn in 10-year bonds with a 3 per cent coupon at a yield of 3.05 per cent, roughly 80 basis points above the benchmark Treasury, according to a person familiar with the deal.Bankers were able to tighten the spread from initial pricing indications earlier in the trading day, and the 10-year debt ultimately sold at a yield below Disney’s last bond offering in September.Barclays raised $4bn in five- and 10-year notes, the day’s largest offering, while Citi sold $2bn worth of 10-year bonds.The financing arms of Deere & Co and Harley-Davidson, as well as Entergy Arkansas, also tapped US fixed income markets. The US offerings were joined by a $4.5bn debt offering from the European Investment Bank and a €3.25bn deal from Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler, among other global deals, according to Dealogic.Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, said she expected a busy few days of debt issuance ahead of the start of earnings season in the US, when many companies enter blackout periods.Ms Lurie added that investors were closely attuned to swings in volatility, which could affect when companies come to market.“We’ll see more sporadic issuance, similar to 2015 where you had periods of a lot of issuance and periods the market was quiet,” she said.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
33;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2015-10-20T20:52:22Z;IBM stumbles as quarterly profits fall;Technology company partly attributes decline to stronger dollar;IBM came under heavy pressure on Tuesday after it posted a sharp drop in quarterly profits and cut its outlook for the year.It said late on Monday that both its net profit and revenue fell 14 per cent in the third quarter. Part of the decline was attributable to a stronger US dollar and the divestment of a business. But the results still showed continuing signs of weakness for a company once famous for its mainframes and floppy disks.IBM has seen its sales decline year-on-year every quarter since the first quarter of 2012, according to data from Bloomberg. Meanwhile, its strategic imperatives unit, focused on forward-looking markets such as cloud computing, is growing quickly but remains a small part of its total portfolio.“We continue to see challenges for IBM’s core business and expect sales to decline as growth in strategic imperatives will be more than offset by declines in the core business,” wrote Sherri Scribner, a research analyst at Deutsche Bank, in a note to clients on the heels of the report.IBM’s shares tumbled 5.7 per cent to $140.68, pushing the stock to a year-to-date decline of 12 per cent. Its market value has plunged more than 40 per cent since hitting $242.7bn in 2012.Elsewhere, shares of Yum Brands rallied 1.9 per cent to $73.05. The parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, among other brands, said it would spin off its China unit. Until recently, the group had been a bright spot for the fast-food chain, but food safety scares and strategic mis-steps have caused the China division to stagnate.Monster Beverage was another big advancer on the day. The maker of energy drinks is testing its products at select McDonald’s locations, according to an analysis by Robert Ottenstein, head of Evercore ISI’s global beverages research team. Mr Ottenstein said the results had been “positive”. The shares rallied 5.2 per cent to $139.61.United Technologies jumped 3.9 per cent to $95.64 after the US industrial heavyweight revealed stronger than expected quarterly profits and a $12bn share buyback plan. It said the buyback included a $6bn accelerated share repurchase using the net proceeds from its sale of helicopter maker Sikorsky.Harley-Davidson, the biggest US maker of motorcycles, skidded deep into negative territory after its quarterly results trailed estimates, and it cut its expectations for worldwide shipments this year. The shares dropped 14 per cent to $48.25, knocking its year-to-date loss to 27 per cent.The Nasdaq biotechnology index tumbled 3.2 per cent, with more than 130 per cent of the companies it tracks in the red on the day. The sector, which has been a favourite throughout the bull market, has faced intense volatility as scrutiny of drug price increases among some politicians has escalated.The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,030.77, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1 per cent to 17,217.11 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.5 per cent to 4,880.97.
34;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
35;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2015-10-20T16:49:55Z;Harley-Davidson shares stall on competitive outlook;Stronger dollar helps foreign rivals grab US market share in motorcycles;Harley-Davidson has been forced to rein in its ambitions for the year, sending the manufacturer’s shares plunging in their biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis.The motorcycle maker warned of intense competition for the “foreseeable future” as foreign rivals take advantage of the stronger dollar to take market share in its own backyard.That took its toll on Harley’s domestic sales last quarter, which dropped 2.5 per cent to 48,918. By contrast, the Milwaukee-based manufacturer’s overseas sales climbed 0.9 per cent from a year earlier, with Asia leading the way. Sales rose 5.1 per cent there and clocked a 2.4 per cent jump in Europe, where the broader economy is showing tentative signs of recovery.Despite the rosier picture beyond US shores, Harley still cut its full-year shipment forecast and now expects that to be as much as 2 per cent lower than in 2014. The company, whose origins stretch back to 1903, said it expects to ship 265,000 to 270,000 bikes this year.Matt Levatich, chief executive, vowed to accelerate growth, pledging to increase Harley’s marketing spending by 65 per cent and invest 35 per cent more in developing its fleet.Although Harley had warned in July of stiffening competition from the likes of Kawasaki in Japan and Polaris in Germany, investors punished the stock on Tuesday. The shares tumbled 15 per cent to $47.56, in their biggest drop since November 2008.Harley said profits for the three months ending on September 27 fell to $140m from $150m in the year ago period.
36;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2015-09-22T15:53:51Z;Walker falls victim to deep Republican rift;Wisconsin governor fails to bridge gap between party’s establishment and outsiders;When Scott Walker delivered a fiery speech in Iowa in January, it was music to the ears of conservatives nervous about Jeb Bush becoming the standard bearer for Republicans and their campaign for the White House in 2016.After impressing people with tales about his Sisyphean battle with the unions in a Democratic state, the Wisconsin governor soared in the polls, reaching a peak of 25 per cent in February. But his campaign ended on Monday after CNN revealed in a poll that his support had sunk to “an asterisk”, meaning less than one per cent of Republicans backed his candidacy.He was in some ways the architect of his own fall. While his conservative credentials were never in doubt, his foreign policy experience came under early scrutiny after he spoke at Chatham House, the UK foreign policy think-tank, but refused to discuss world affairs. He was later mocked for saying his victory over the unions qualified him to tackle the so-called Islamic State in the Middle East.The Harley-Davidson riding politician also flip-flopped on issues such as immigration and his suggestion that the US build a wall along the Canadian border. His attempt to compete with Donald Trump, the property mogul, who was proposing the same for the Mexican border, was widely lampooned.“Walker’s failure shows how difficult it is to try to bridge the gap between the populist rightwing and mainstream conservatives,” said Vin Weber, a former Minnesota congressman supporting Mr Bush, the former Florida governor. “It shows other candidates in the race that you have to plant your flag and tell people what you believe.”His spectacular decline was also propelled by the rise of political outsiders — led by Mr Trump— who have turned the 2016 GOP race on its head. Mr Trump has stolen many of the angry, working-class white men who should have been a natural constituency for Mr Walker, a college dropout who casts himself as an everyday American who wears unassuming clothes.While Mr Trump took some of his supporters, Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, also stole a big chunk of his support, not least among evangelical Christians in Iowa. Ultimately, Mr Walker failed on two fronts. He could not compete with the outsider insurgents riding a wave of anti-Washington sentiment, and he failed to distinguish himself from the rest of the field.“Walker looked for a time like the candidate who could unite the GOP’s affluent donors and hard-pressed voting base,” said David Frum, a former speech writer for George W Bush. “But as elite and base have turned against each other, Walker was caught in between.”Republican debate leaves race to lead party in 2016 wide openRead moreThe influence of the political outsiders, who have been joined at the top by Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, has also been felt by Mr Bush. The former Florida governor has amassed a war chest of more than $100m fuelled by big mainstream Republican donors. But he has failed to spark much excitement among the grassroots, and is lagging in the polls where his decline has to a lesser degree mirrored the fall of Mr Walker.Ironically for Mr Walker, his departure from the race comes on the heels of the second Republican debate where Ms Fiorina appeared to find a chink in the armour of Mr Trump, whose poll numbers have since dipped. Some mainstream Republicans now believe — although not for the first time — that the real estate magnate may have already peaked.Larry Sabato, a politics expert at the University of Virginia, said the biggest impact of Mr Walker leaving the race was that it marked the start of a “serious winnowing” of the Republican field. In his speech on Monday, Mr Walker called on other candidates to drop out to narrow the field so that the party could focus on defeating Mr Trump, whose anti-immigrant rhetoric threatens the GOP’s chances of winning the White House.Candidates shift from anti-Hispanic to anti-Islamic rhetoric in heated presidential battleRead more“That’s bad news for Trump and Carson, whose success depends heavily on keeping the candidate field large and the vote fractured,” said Mr Sabato. “Walker declared war on Trump in withdrawing. That’s good news for more mainstream candidates, such as [Marco] Rubio, [John] Kasich [Ohio governor], and maybe Bush. I get the feeling this may be a turning point, when the GOP starts to get serious about trying to pick a winner.”One well-connected Republican said Mr Rubio was likely to attract more of the support and money that would have stuck with Mr Walker had his performance been better. The young Cuban-American senator was seen to have a good debate performance last week, and has since risen in the polls.Another question is which candidate will benefit most from the $900m that Charles and David Koch, the industrialist billionaire brothers, and their network of rich donors intend to splurge on the race. Earlier in the campaign, Mr Walker was seen as one of the most likely recipients for their cash.@DimiSevastopulo

On Tuesday the company affirmed its outlook for motorbike shipments to grow between 2 per cent and 4 per cent this year, or between 276,000 and 281,000 bikes, compared with initial forecasts of 4 per cent to 6 per cent growth.The Milwaukee-based company, revered by leather-clad bikers, saw a dip in second-quarter profits but beat analysts’ expectations, sending its shares 5 per cent higher by close of trading. Shares in Harley have fallen 14 per cent over the past year.Harley’s sales have slipped this year, even as demand for motorbikes remains strong, which the company blames on currency swings and price-cutting from its rivals abroad, which include Kawasaki and Honda in Japan, and Polaris in Germany.Harley has opted to trim production rather than cut its own prices so as to “protect its premium brand”, the company said in April.Net income for the three months to the end of June fell 15 per cent to $299.8m, or $1.44 a share, from $354.2m, or $1.62 a share, a year ago. Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.39 a share.Overall revenues for the second quarter dipped to $1.7bn from $1.8bn a year ago.In a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, the company said it expected the currency impact to hit revenues by 5 per cent in the third quarter.Matt Levatich, Harley’s chief executive, said: “In the face of a tough competitive environment, driven mostly by currency and greater competitive activity, we are leveraging our many strengths and meeting the challenge head on.”Harley maintains a stronghold on its biggest customer segment — men aged 35 and up in the US — where its market share has jumped from 49 per cent in 2008, to 62 per cent in 2014.Globally, Harley sold 88,931 motorbikes in the second quarter, down 1.4 per cent from its 90,218 a year ago.Sales fell 8.9 per cent in Europe, 2.6 per cent in Latin America, and 9.9 per cent in Canada in the second quarter. Asia-Pacific was a bright spot for Harley where sales rose 16.6 per cent in the region, despite a slowdown in the Chinese economy.

But that figure fell short of its previous forecast of 282,000 to 287,000 motorcycles.Harley, which derived just over 35 per cent of its sales outside the US last year, reported a 1.1 per cent sales drop in the first quarter in Asia Pacific and a 5.6 per cent drop in Europe. Sales in Latin America edged up 0.3 per cent and were 5.7 per cent stronger in Canada.However, in the US, the company said aggressive discounting in the motorcycle market weighed on results. There, sales were down 0.7 per cent from a year ago to 35,730.“We had picked up on a number of these promotions coming from Japanese manufacturers in [the] first quarter, and while most of our dealer contacts believed that the competitive environment had not had much of an impact on their higher-end sales, we believe the entry-level bikes are much more at risk to competitors’ actions,” said James Hardiman, an analyst at Wedbush.Overall, Harley’s profits rose to $269.9m, or $1.27 a share, from $265.9m, or $1.21 a share, a year earlier. Revenues declined 3 per cent to $1.67bn.Shares of Harley-Davidson, which have fallen 16 per cent in the past year, declined nearly 10 per cent on Tuesday to $55.72.Athletic apparel maker Under Armour, issued full-year sales guidance that missed Wall Street forecasts, despite the success of US golfer Jordan Spieth, who promotes the brand.The company lifted its full-year revenue forecast to $3.78bn, from $3.76bn, but the guidance fell short of estimates for $3.81bn.The outlook came alongside a drop in first-quarter profits. The Baltimore, Maryland-based company reported profits of $11.7m, or 5 cents a share, in the three months ended in March, compared with $13.5m, or 6 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Sales climbed 25 per cent to $804.9m.“As far as we’re concerned, Under Armour just needs to keep doing what it’s doing because the results are impressive,” said Randall J Konik, an analyst at Sterne Agee. “From a stock perspective, however, we see few near-term catalysts to drive share price appreciation . . . and increasingly high expectations that are getting harder and harder to beat,” he added.Shares of Under Armour fell 4.8 per cent to $83.52.United Technologies shares gained 0.4 per cent to $116.95, after the US industrial conglomerate said first-quarter profits topped Wall Street forecasts. However, sales declined 1 per cent to $14.5bn, missing estimates, as the strong dollar weighed on results.New York-listed shares of Israeli drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals rose more than 1 per cent to $64.16, after the company offered to buy US drugmaker Mylan.Teva offered $82 a share in cash and stock for each Mylan share, valuing the company at $40.1bn. Mylan shares rose 9 per cent to $74.07.US stocks fluctuated between losses and gains throughout the session.The S&P 500 ended the day 0.2 per cent lower at 2,097.29 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.5 per cent to 17,949.59.

It left its guidance unchanged, expecting to ship 270,000 to 275,000 motorcycles to dealers in 2014.“Full-year guidance is unchanged on all fronts (shipments, gross margin, capex) which should be seen as good news given a growing chorus of shorts that believed Harley would be forced to lower its guide for the second consecutive quarter,” said James Hardiman, an analyst at Longbow Research.Analysts at Longbow believe the numbers are positive for the Harley-Davidson story and that the relaunch of the Road Glide models should be a “significant benefit” for the company over the next three quarters.Shares climbed 8 per cent to $62.83. The company’s shares have fallen10 per cent so far this year.Chipotle shares slipped 7 per cent to $608.66 after the Mexican fast-food chain forecast 2015 same-store sales growth to be in low-to-single digits and on analyst concerns about commodity inflation.Chipotle’s net income surged 57 per cent to $130.8m, or $4.22 a share, ahead of expectations. Revenue increased by almost a third to $1.08bn. Profits climbed despite a rise in food costs.Comparable restaurant sales increased 19.8 per cent, ahead of expectations for a 16.7 per cent gain.“Low-to-mid single-digit comp guidance for 2015 is irrelevant, in our view, as witnessed by the multiyear track record of low initial guidance,” said John Glass, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “However, commodity pressure, which reared its head despite the recent price increase, will likely persist into 2015, upending a part of the bull thesis.”Analysts at Morgan Stanley lowered their price target to $696 while maintaining their “overweight” rating.Shares of Illumina advanced 9 per cent to $179.55 after solid third-quarter results.The company reported net income of $93.5m or 63 cents a share in the three months ending September. Revenue gained nearly 35 per cent to $480.6mThis beat Wall Street expectations for earnings of 46 cents a share on revenue of $451.5m.Apple shares gained 3 per cent after the company beat Wall Street forecasts on fourth-quarter earnings, revenues and iPhone sales. The company spent more than $20bn on dividends and share buybacks in the quarter.Coca-Cola shares slipped 6 per cent to $40.68 after the company reported a decline in third-quarter profits. The company also announced a $3bn cost-cutting programme that failed to calm investors, as it continues to struggle with currency headwinds and soft sales.US stocks gained on hopes of more stimulus from the European Central Bank to stimulate growth in the eurozone.The S&P 500 gained 2 per cent to 1,941.22.

40;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2014-10-17T16:19:34Z;Riding Harleys in Andalucía;New tours from motorbike maker Harley-Davidson offer the chance to live out ‘Easy Rider’ fantasies;"Afternoon rush hour in Granada and the streets are buzzing with scooters and bicycles. They weave along the cobbled lanes around the Alhambra at breakneck speed, beeping horns, ringing bells and racing through the narrowest of gaps. Most riders are in shorts and T-shirts – any other kind of protection has to be ditched to cope with the stifling heat.So when I pull up outside Las Tomasas, a restaurant overlooking the palace, dressed in full leathers and astride a hulking, thudding Harley-Davidson, the waiter looks bemused. However, the sight of big, classic US motorbikes on these ancient roads is likely to become increasingly common. Earlier this year, the US manufacturer began marketing its own holidays in Andalucía, the latest addition to a worldwide range of “authorised tours”. Guests can choose from fully escorted trips, on which they ride in a convoy of up to 15 motorbikes, with a guide and support vehicle; a “semi-guided” trip, with the option of riding alone but with a guide on call; or a self-guided itinerary, which still includes pre-booked hotels, maps and sightseeing suggestions.I am on a self-guided tour with a friend – both of us “born-again bikers” who owned motorcycles as teenagers, loved the film Easy Rider and the image of Harley-Davidson but still aren’t quite ready to buy into the bandana-wearing dream – at least not without an extended test ride first. A tour of Andalucía seems like the perfect opportunity.Our adventure started at the Harley dealership in the heart of Málaga, a 15-minute taxi ride from the airport. Our two bikes, mid-range Heritage Softail Classics, were parked outside and looked magnificent, with sparkling chrome and leather saddlebags. There was a €1,000 deposit to pay, a couple of forms to sign and then we were handed the keys. It was no more complicated than collecting a hire car, except with rather less luggage space.Overdressed and under-prepared for the sweltering heat of southern Spain, the first 30 minutes escaping Málaga were hot and uncomfortable. Around town, a 1690cc Harley engine sounds like a noisy sewing machine; it was only when the coast road opened up ahead of us that the bikes took on the purr of a Spitfire.It’s possible to ride from Málaga to Granada in under two hours – but it is far more picturesque to follow the coast to Motril and then turn north along the narrow, winding N-323. The Harley may be a heavy bike but it is also remarkably easy to handle, happily chugging around bends at 50mph. Traffic was scarce and soon we were counting more goats than cars and breathing in the scent of lemon trees.The next morning, the scenery softens as we head north on the N-432 to Córdoba. Lemon trees give way to fields of sunflowers, then groves of olives. When we reach the motorway to Seville, the central reservation is a riot of pink and red oleander bushes. They shower us in petals every time we follow an overtaking truck in the fast lane.Although Seville sits 50 miles inland, it has an old port on the River Guadalquivir, and that is where we head. It’s an area enjoying a renaissance after the shipyard shut down three years ago, where restaurants such as Puerto Delicia and Becerrita serve avant-garde menus based on traditional Andalucían cuisine.Our route from here heads south towards Jerez de la Frontera, the sherry capital of Spain. We cover 350 miles in two days and despite being more used to a car seat than a motorcycle saddle, the relaxed riding position of the Harley proves surprisingly comfortable. Spanish drivers also seem unusually respectful of motorbikes.After the overwhelming beauty of Seville and Granada, Jerez is something of a let-down. However, as we pore over a map, sitting on the square outside La Cruz Blanca restaurant, wandering street musicians help us to unwind from our long ride. It’s early evening by the time we drag ourselves away to visit the nearby Tío Pepe distillery; later, at the atmospheric Tabanco El Pasaje, we stumble across a flamenco evening.On the road south from Jerez to Tarifa, it is impossible to ignore the historic Muslim influence. Some signs are written in both Spanish and Arabic, while Morocco is clearly visible, 10 miles across the Strait of Gibraltar. Tarifa is a laid-back hangout for windsurfers, and a centre for whale-watching tours. Tourists mix with dreadlocked surfers and there’s a feeling that anything goes.Our final day of riding is by far the most scenic, taking us north from the busy port of Algeciras on the winding back roads to Ronda. It’s challenging too, with hairpin bends and frost damaged tarmac across the Sierra de Grazalema. The beautiful “white towns” of Andalucía are a constant distraction but the A-405 route must surely be on every biker’s list of dream destinations.Back in Málaga, after 600 miles of inspirational riding, it’s tough swapping two wheels for a taxi again. I’ve bonded with my bike, and seem to have found my inner Dennis Hopper – even if I’m still not quite ready for the bandana.——————————————-Jeremy Taylor was a guest of Harley-Davidson (authorizedtours.harley-davidson.co.uk), the Spanish Tourist Office (spain.info) and Andalucía Tourism (andalucia.org).

41;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2014-07-22T17:07:16Z;Chipotle outpaces rivals on strong sales;Results contrast with those from McDonald’s;Chipotle continued to outpace rivals in the fast food sector, reporting strong gains in same store sales as peers including McDonald’s, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell fail to ignite consumer interest.Profits at the chain known for its steak and barbacoa tacos climbed 26 per cent to $110.3m, or $3.50 a share, in the quarter to June 30. Sales climbed 29 per cent to $1.05bn as same-store sales rose 17.3 per cent.Analysts on Wall Street had expected profits of $3.09 a share from sales of $990m.The results contrasted with those from McDonald’s, which once again saw tepid demand in the US for its burgers and fries. Same-store sales at the company’s US outlets declined 1.5 per cent in the quarter, a steeper dip than analysts expected.While McDonald’s has continued to focus its strategy around lower cost items through its dollar menu, executives at Chipotle have lifted prices at the chain’s 1,600 restaurants since April, a decision they argue has offset rising food inflation.The move received little push back from Chipotle’s fervent following and the company now expects same-store sales to increase by a “mid-teens” percentage over the remainder of this year.“We continue to believe Chipotle [is] the best growth story in restaurants,” Jeffrey Bernstein, an analyst with Barclays, said. “With most restaurants struggling to drive positive traffic, Chipotle remains an anomaly, justifying an outsized valuation.”Shares in the Mexican restaurant chain soared 12 per cent to $659.77 on the news, while McDonald’s retreated 1 per cent to $96.27. Taco Bell owner Yum Brands advanced 1 per cent to $74.84.Harley-Davidson led the benchmark S&P 500 lower on Tuesday after the company cut its outlook for full-year shipments.The motorcycle maker now forecasts a 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent rise in shipments this year compared to 2013. In April, it had predicted growth of between 7 and 9 per cent.The company pinned the blame on poor weather and a lull in sales of one of its models before the release of a new version later this year.Harley-Davidson shares fell 5 per cent at $63.46.Profits at Coca-Cola, the world’s biggest soft drinks maker, slipped in the second quarter as sales in the US failed to lift off.The company said net income fell 3 per cent to $2.6bn, or 58 cents a share, in the quarter to the end of June. Revenues were also under pressure, falling to $12.6bn from $12.7bn.Coca-Cola, which built its brand and fortune selling the world fizzy drinks, is grappling with a US market that is losing its taste for sugary drinks.The company said Coca-Cola volumes in North America edged up 1 per cent in the quarter, while overall sales in the region were flat.Shares in the company fell 3 per cent to $41.19 while rival PepsiCo declined 1 per cent to $89.17.Crocs, the struggling maker of colourful plastic clogs that were ubiquitous a decade ago, announced it will close or convert up to 100 of its stores and lay off 183 employees.The closures are expected to save $4m in 2014 and $10m in 2015, as Crocs seeks to save cash and revive its business.Crocs announced the move along with second-quarter earnings that were ahead of Wall Street expectations. Shares of Crocs advanced 13 per cent to $16.72.Netflix shares dipped 5 per cent to $431.09 after the company said its international expansion would drive losses in the division higher.The company, which started in the US, has expanded aggressively across Europe and racked up losses of $712m abroad since 2012.The initial losses have not dented Netflix’s ambition beyond the US. It plans to add service in France and Germany this September. Analysts with Jefferies said the expansion would “pressure” the company’s margins.Overall, US equity markets rose after a report showed the sale of previously owned homes recovered more than expected and core inflation in the country eased.The S&P 500 advanced 0.5 per cent to 1,983.53, touching a new record high earlier in the day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 17,113.54.

42;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2014-07-02T17:13:09Z;Constellation cheered by Modelo results;;Constellation Brands was toasted by investors as the $5.3bn acquisition of beer maker Grupo Modelo, completed last year, showed further signs of paying off.Shares in the wine, beer and spirits company jumped 2 per cent to $90.45 on its results for the quarter, continuing an upward trend since Constellation acquired the Mexican business.Its market value has risen 76 per cent during the past year.A marketing campaign for its newly acquired beers, including Model Especial and Corona, had lured consumers as the summer began, the brewer said.Constellation raised its annual profit forecast to between $4.10 and $4.25 a share, up from an earlier estimate of $3.95 to $4.15.The group, which is based in New York, secured Modelo’s US business after regulators forced larger rival Anheuser-Busch InBev to offload it.AB InBev was seeking approval to buy the rest of Grupo Modelo.Sales more than doubled to $1.53bn in the quarter from a year earlier while profits followed a similar upward path, climbing to $215m.Ahead of the bank earnings season, shares in Bank of America rose 2 per cent to $15.85 after Deutsche Bank upgraded its target value from $16.50 to $18.Analyst Matthew O’Connor noted that shares in the lender were almost 10 per cent below recent highs after investors had priced in a “slew of disappointments”, including weaker first-quarter results than expect, an accounting error that halted capital deployment plans and the US Justice Department mortgage settlement.“These issues are well known at this point,” Mr O’Connor wrote.“[Earnings per share] power has an upward trajectory and if macro conditions improve, EPS and valuation should both benefit.”He concluded that there was less litigation risk for the bank, apart from remaining mortgage issues, than for some of its peers that face action over Libor manipulation, foreign exchange trading and money laundering scandals.Shares in Delta Air Lines fell 5 per cent to $38.24 after it reported lower growth than expected in passenger revenue per seat available.The measure increased 4.5 per cent in June, year on year, but was less than expected because of lower international yields.Domestic demand had been strong, Delta reported, but business demand to Latin America was lower because of the World CupShares in Tyson Foods rose 3 per cent to $38.96 on news that it had sealed its deal to acquire Hillshire Brands for $8.55bn after beating rival bidders.Tyson’s acquisition of Hillshire had been only a matter of time after a bidding war with Pilgrim’s Pride forced the price up to $63 a share – about 70 per cent higher than Hillshire’s value before the battle erupted.For the acquisition to happen, Hillshire had needed to extricate itself from a promise to buy Pinnacle Foods.Tyson disclosed on Wednesday that it had paid Pinnacle a $163m termination fee on behalf of Hillshire to shelve that deal.Shares in Hillshire were little changed while Pinnacle Foods was down 2 per cent to $31.48.Harley-Davidson fell 4 per cent to $67.80, after broker Raymond James downgraded the motorcycle company from “strong buy” to “market perform”.Overall, US equities remained on a modest upward march. The S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 1,974.62. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.1 per cent upwards to 16,976.24 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.02 per cent to 4,457.73.
43;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2014-04-22T21:52:08Z;Harley-Davidson races up S&P leaderboard;;Harley-Davidson, the maker of the eponymous motorcycles, raced up the S&P 500’s leaderboard after reporting better than expected first-quarter profit.Buoyed by demand in the US, Asia and Europe, the manufacturer’s profits jumped by almost a fifth to $265.9m, or $1.21 per diluted share.Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.08 a share and Harley’s ability to speed past Wall Street’s forecasts sent its shares up 6.4 per cent to $71.87.The stock has gained 41 per cent in the past 12 months, double the return of the S&P 500.On a second straight day of gains for US stocks, the better performances were not confined to manufacturers.Shares of Netflix, whose online video streaming service is disrupting the television industry, climbed 7 per cent to $372.90 after the company on Monday night reported a surge in first-quarter profits.With subscriber growth still rising, investors also welcomed Netflix’s plan to raise prices.Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald lifted their rating on the company to buy, citing second-quarter forecasts and strong international expansion.“Netflix has got a lot more compelling,” said Cantor’s Youssef Squali.The results from Netflix kicked off a critical week for the Nasdaq 100, the home of the largest companies on the wider Nasdaq Composite index.Companies representing 52 per cent of the market capitalisation of the Nasdaq 100 report first-quarter results this week, with social network Facebook and Apple, the iPhone maker, due to report after the stock market’s close on Wednesday.The Nasdaq’s 1 per cent jump on Tuesday suggests that investors are less anxious than they were before the index’s recent sell-off tempered some valuations.The technology-heavy index remains down 0.4 per cent in 2014 after surging 38 per cent last year.Equity investors were also in the mood to look on the brighter side of Tuesday’s US economic data.Sales of existing homes dipped 0.2 per cent in March but the decline was far shallower than economists had feared.Economists at Barclays argued that “while this marks the seventh time in the past eight months that existing home sales have posted month on month declines, we think that transitory headwinds such as higher mortgage rates and unusually severe winter weather have played a significant role, and we would expect existing home sales to pick up as these effects fade”.And home improvement chain Home Depot, whose fortunes are closely tied to the housing market, was the biggest gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Its shares rose 2.2 per cent to $79.67 after brokerage BMO Capital Markets raised its rating on the shares to outperform.Home Depot’s last quarterly results beat Wall Street’s forecasts and the company reports its next results on May 20.Pharmaceutical companies were buoyed on Tuesday by news that activist investor Bill Ackman had teamed up with generic drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals in pursuit of Allergan, a sign that deal activity in the industry remains buoyant.In a short statement, Allergan said it would consider the $45.6bn hostile offer.Analysts at Jefferies said consolidation in the industry was expected to continue, lifted by healthy fundamentals at large-cap drugmakers and “pipelines stocked with high-value candidates”, albeit with “significant clinical risk”.“The 10-year consolidation theme shows no sign of letting up,” Jefferies analyst David Steinberg said.“After less than four months, 2014 is shaping up to be a record-setting year. Most notably, the average transaction size of purchased public companies has swelled to $6.4bn.”Shares of Allergan climbed 15.25 per cent to $163.65.Overall, the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 1,879.55 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.4 per cent to 16,514.37. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.97 per cent to 4,161.46.
44;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2014-04-22T21:27:42Z;Harley-Davidson: hog heaven;Group is pushing its bikes on new customers – and it is working;We all know the stereotype: a burly, middle-aged American white guy atop his hog, cruising the open road, pipes roaring. The limited market of rebel pensioners was once a concern for investors in Harley-Davidson. But the future of the legendary motorcycle maker might look very different.The company has retooled its product line to appeal to a wider range of easy riders. This strategy – along with a multiyear overhaul of its manufacturing that was wrapped up last year – is working. The shares are up 40 per cent in a year and are gaining on their pre-crisis high. To keep the pace, Harley needs to make even bigger inroads with new customers.Both sales and earnings beat expectations in the first quarter, lending some confidence to Harley’s plans. The shares jumped 6 per cent on Tuesday. But retail sales of motorcycles in the US (nearly two-thirds of the total) rose a modest 3 per cent. Worse yet, that was in an easy comparison with a year ago when they dropped 13 per cent.An especially cold winter in the US is a legitimate excuse for this type of shortfall, however, given the kind of purchase. International markets fared much better. Dealers sold 11 per cent more Harleys abroad – including 9 per cent more sold to tear up highways in Latin America, and sales a fifth higher in Asia Pacific.Back in the US, motorcycle sales to “outreach” customers (those aged 18-34, women, African Americans and Hispanics) also grew at more than twice the rate of sales to core customers, in 2013 versus the year before.Harley’s stock has already been speeding. The last year’s increase was nearly double the gain of the S&P 500. At $72, shares are trading at 18 times forward earnings. Wall Street estimates call for an 18 per cent increase in earnings per share. For enthusiasts who believe that pace of growth can be maintained, there is still time to take a ride.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
45;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2014-04-21T13:16:44Z;Deutsche Börse Photography Prize 2014, The Photographers’ Gallery, London – review;Diverse and demanding offerings make this year’s exhibition a must-see;"This annual exhibition has tended to polarise opinion among members of the various photographic tribes. But this time there is no hesitation in saying that you should go, see and think.Two candidates present films that are much stronger than the photographs on the walls. Richard Mosse made Enclave, an artwork that is inescapably a film, a searing trip through the lunatic micro-wars of the Kivu lands in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which was shot on obsolete military infrared film stock and is shown this time on eight screens in a basement car park not far from the gallery.Mosse shows only a handful of pictures, which deal with part of his enquiry but sell it short. The photographs in the gallery are no more indicative of the whole film than posters outside would be. Infrared film shows vegetation in a range of pinks and crimsons and puces, and one of the points of Mosse’s film is that cruel, mad lawlessness is hard to see in the standard tropes of western war photography or journalism. It is no coincidence that infrared film was designed to make the invisible visible. It’s a brilliant metaphorical tool, as well as a technical medium. But only a fraction of what it can do is on the walls. Seen only as photographs, Mosse’s deeply troubling film is emasculated.The opposite applies to Alberto García-Alix, who has made something quite different: in effect a slide-show of his own images over a number of years. All autobiography involves a degree of navel-gazing, but this autobiography doesn’t rise above that. Once you gather that García-Alix is happy to put it all out for us – from the smack needle in his arm to a view in a bathroom mirror of his urinating penis – there is not very much left. Outcast rebel rocker survives heroin and various other abuses, and grows to be a famous artist in Spain, and here are a few not-very-illuminating snaps to show the journey. It’s all rather conventional outlawry, with Harley-Davidson, for example, taken very much at its own brand value. The fact that this took place as Spain moved from Francoism to its more liberal present is neither here nor there. The film, De Donde No Se Vuelve (From Whence There is No Return), adds elements that take this humdrum stuff and elevate it. Careful sequencing and a degree of movement give it rhythm. Music sets a mood as only music can. And the voice of the artist talking slowly over the pictures successfully gives them an intimacy, a poetry and a poignancy that the pictures on their own lack.Jochen Lempert shows a very likable set of pictures about patterns in nature. Trained as a biologist, Lempert takes the cataloguing, listing aspect of photography and makes it poetical. The best of his pictures are elegant little groups, deliberately unframed and taped directly to the walls, in which patterns form and reform to make shapes that we – anthropocentric as we are – can’t help but scan for meaning. So a skein of geese high in the sky takes the shape of a face – and not any face, but a recognisable face: Lempert gives it the title “Fromme Helene” (Pious Helene), a well-known 19th-century comic character.A lovely group of photograms of frogs show the creatures’ delightfully graphic shapes. Some of them scooted as the pictures were taken, and Lempert has rendered the skittering movements between long periods of stillness that are characteristic of the beast. These are nicely weighted things at a fine intersection between science and whimsy.They rely, though, too heavily on whatever words go with them. They are pictures to which anybody – the artist, loyal friendly critic, viewer, prize panel – can attach their own meanings. They are empty vessels to be filled by anything anybody wants to think when confronted by them. That’s a very common trick in contemporary art, but it misses photography’s primary function as a means of communication.Lorna Simpson is represented by a set of pictures, “Summer ’57/Summer ’09”, that goes far beyond charm. Simpson found a set of anonymous pictures from 1957 of an African-American woman in Los Angeles. The woman’s partner, a shutterbug, had taken pictures of her in a series of cheesecake poses in playsuits and other informal clothing. Simpson later re-enacted some of these poses, and she exhibits the two series as one. In doing so she brings modern feminist and critical thinking to bear on her archive hoard.But it’s not just the absurdities of the pin-up role that are examined; we’re looking deep into the territory that Maya Angelou and Walter Mosely made their own, of the black diaspora from the South and from poverty. The pin-up poses are set in a sparsely furnished middle-modest new development in a suburb. A convertible called a Sunliner is proudly shown off. There is hope and sunshine and new furniture on the hire-purchase plan. Yet there is also a scrupulous artist asking us to leaven the original standard readings of these vernacular pictures into something richer, darker and more complex.In one of the pictures, the modelling was done one sunny afternoon in a park. The woman wears a bikini and has eyes only for the photographer. Behind her, two white men in Stetson-type hats are fully clothed and although they share the park with her, they don’t really inhabit the same world. With neither tub-thumping nor academic gobbledegook, this clever set of small black-and-white pictures take us a long way into thinking about some aspects of the African-American experience, about the dream of prosperity for all, about changing attitudes to women, and about the business of reworking history.This is good stuff. Each of the four artists can stand for a separate tendency in modern photography. Mosse takes his place among the likes of Donovan Wylie or Simon Norfolk or Sophie Ristelhueber in offering new ways of thinking about conflict. García-Alix and Lorna Simpson both use the camera to tell us about themselves, García-Alix more narcissistically while Simpson is much more in touch with cultural and sociological patterns. And Lempert is pushing hard at the boundaries where photography crashes into science. In all of them, we are asked to do more than simply see pictures.

Triumph now manufactures or assembles its machines at seven different facilities: two in the UK, three in Thailand, one in Brazil and one near Delhi.Stroud said the company was gaining share in a shrinking global market and on track to sell a record 51,000 motorcycles worldwide this year, up 8 per cent year-on-year. New markets to be tackled in the current financial year, ending in mid-2014, included China and Indonesia as well as India.A year ago, Triumph began assembling its motorcycles in the Amazonian city of Manaus in Brazil, and expects to sell 3,500 machines there in the financial year, for a market share of nearly 7 per cent of sales of those with large engines. “Triumph has grown to become a truly global business,” he said.Royal Enfield, the Indian brand owned by Mumbai-listed Eicher Motors, sold about 113,000 motorcycles in India last year, including 95 per cent of those with engines larger than 350cc. In a mirror image of Triumph’s push into India, Royal Enfield is seeking to boost its hitherto vestigial presence in the UK.Related reading:

47;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2013-06-12T23:07:52Z;Consumers;A world of increasingly well-informed and wealthy consumers is driving a revolution in how goods are made, marketed and sold, writes Louise Lucas;"From the immediate postwar era, when shortages, rationing and black-market dealings defined the consciousness in much of Europe, to the freshly minted middle classes proliferating across Asia, Latin America and Africa, the ability to see, want and buy is an integral part of the human psyche. Manufacturers of goods – both those we need and those we could comfortably do without – have monetised this with abandon.Thus, more than a century after the first Ford motor car rolled off the assembly line, there are now more than 1bn cars on the planet. In China alone, 120m passenger cars ply the roads; this in a country whose roads not two decades ago were dominated by bicycles.However, the capriciousness of consumers, and the size of their wallets, makes this two-way traffic. In 2011, for the first time since the second world war, Italians bought more bikes than cars – a big turnround for the country that spawned marques such as Fiat, Ferrari and Lamborghini and where car ownership became a symbol of the 1960s economic miracle.Or take fashion. The desire for cheap but chic clothes has, over the past two decades or so, resulted in disposable fashion and the rise of stores selling of-the-moment kit that, with T-shirts going for $5-$10, are clamouring for attention on the world’s high streets.Some, such as Zara of Spain, have new stock arriving on a weekly basis, enticing customers to come in and update their looks each weekend. A wealth of supply chains make that easier: switching suppliers for western European branches from, say, China to the Czech Republic makes just-in-time shopping easy. If bright orange is suddenly in, tangerine bikinis can be on the hangers within days.The luxury sector does not move quite as fast but is no less covetable. That market, whether for yachts, frocks or safaris, is set to hit $1.5tn this year, roughly matching the entire economic output of Spain or Australia, according to Boston Consulting Group.Luxury goods and services have the merit of being about more than keeping you warm or – in the case of a $1,000 bottle of aged Scotch whisky, sating a thirst. These are status symbols that, in the natural order of things, go with accumulating wealth.This is seen in the rapidly growing sales of luxury goods in the likes of China, which accounts for 10 per cent of the global market. Chinese travelling overseas make a further 12 per cent of purchases, according to Altagamma, the Italian luxury industry association.Manufacturers have played to this, carefully segmenting their product ranges. In retail too, supermarkets might offer basic ready meals alongside middle-of-the road versions and pricier, hopefully nicer, top-of-the-range ones. And designers have diffusion or “little sister” lines, or offerings of $60 perfumes to those who are unable to splash out $2,000 on a bag, for example.Distillers have also perfected the art, selling vintage whiskies in crystal bottles, monogrammed if desired. Diageo, the world’s biggest distiller and the name behind Johnnie Walker Scotch (bottles from £18 to £100,000, for the Diamond Jubilee limited edition), has perfected this art, serving some of its priciest concoctions in the Johnnie Walker House in Beijing and Shanghai.These clubhouses, redolent of decadent 1920s Shanghai, illustrate another way manufacturers and retailers are exerting their pull on consumers’ purse strings. Membership of clubs, whether exclusive drinking houses or supermarkets’ everyone-qualifies loyalty schemes, allows purveyors of goods to track our habits and learn our tastes, thus encouraging us to buy more.Supermarket loyalty cards prove the point. Buying nappies, for example, will flag you up as a new parent and thus a potential customer for infant rice cereal, rattles or soft toothbrushes for barely existent baby teeth.Again, power works both ways. Along with more money, consumers have greater leverage in the form of price comparison websites and smartphone apps in a world where austerity looms large.It is perhaps fitting that people power, which has been a powerful agent for change in the political dynasties of the Philippines and swaths of the Arab world, is alive and kicking in the shopping aisles of the west.——————————————-Brands“In a single day, how many really nonsignifying fields do we cross?” Roland Barthes, the French semiotician, parlayed everything from Greta Garbo’s face to laundry soap through his prism. But brands, those all-important names we covet, consume and then consume some more, remain among modern society’s most prevalent signifiers, writes Louise Lucas.Brands are everywhere: shouting from the television (through adverts and product placements), billboards and the moment you enter a shop. Not for nothing is an early signifier in The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald’s novel and now a Baz Luhrmann-directed film, the enormous yellow spectacles advertising the all-seeing optician TJ Eckleburg.Branding is part of our culture as well as business. There is even a museum of brands in London, housing the collection of more than 12,000 labels, packages and posters of “consumer historian” Robert Opie.A brand, says Don Williams, chief creative officer of pi global, the branding consultancy, is “a distinctive entity which communicates its values, what it stands for, what it does, how it’s different, what it looks like, how it behaves… nations are brands, religions are brands, actually … WE are brands”.Brands, their purveyors believe, build loyalty and ensure we stick with Dove shampoo, Toyota cars or Apple iPhones, for example. Manufacturers of consumer goods, such as Procter & Gamble of the US and Anglo-Dutch Unilever, spend 10-15 per cent of sales on advertising and promotion – much of this brand building.Monetising that brand loyalty is ever more important for businesses, whether it be supermarket loyalty cards or licensing marques – those remote-controlled Ferrari toy cars or Samsung on the shirts of Chelsea footballers.Some companies are taking this to new levels. Ferrari and Harley-Davidson are among those making a decent chunk of their revenues from branded goods alongside their cars and motorbikes, for instance. Deluxe designers have perfumes – usually licensed out – from Gucci’s Guilty to Prada’s Candy.Office addresses, or rather the buildings that house them, are increasingly brands in their own right – London’s The Shard or Kuala Lumpur’s Petronas Towers, for instance.“The world revolves around brands; unless you’re standing naked in a field, you’re surrounded by brands and brand identities,” says Williams.Perhaps subconsciously – for this is how signifiers work – he is echoing Barthes. “Here I am, before the sea; it is true that it bears no message. But on the beach, what material for semiology! Flags, slogans, signals, signboards, clothes, suntan even, which are so many messages to me.”…Online marketplace/EcommerceThe first product sold on eBay, the auction website, was a broken laser pointer, writes Barney Jopson. In September 1995 its founder, Pierre Omidyar, posted it for sale on a website he first named AuctionWeb. The pointer sold for $14.83. When Omidyar asked whether the buyer understood that the pointer did not work, he was reportedly told: “I’m a collector of broken laser pointers.”Two months earlier Jeff Bezos had opened Amazon.com, but Omidyar was more interested in the business of helping others sell online – by creating an open-access marketplace where they could be matched with buyers.In part he used old ideas: the auction and the outdoor marketplace. What was new about the eBay online flea market was that it tested whether strangers could build enough trust over the internet to trade with each other. It sounded unlikely to many at the time. Today, it seems ludicrous to doubt.Trust was built by sellers who offered product photos, contact phone numbers and shipping details. And by payment systems, public scoreboards for customer service and policing mechanisms. Now, online marketplaces are a fixture of global retail.No bazaar is without rogues and counterfeits. But online marketplaces have produced great advances in consumers’ ability to research, price-check and buy a wider range of products.Even Amazon got in on the act. It wants to offer the world’s largest selection of merchandise, but only wants to hold the more popular goods. In 2000, it opened its own marketplace – and so-called third-party sellers now account for 40 per cent of the sales volume on its website.Many sellers are ordinary folk clearing out household junk. Online marketplaces give them an easy way to turn that into cash. In an era of economic volatility and environmental stress, that is an underappreciated form of recycling.…Powerful consumersFrom the ability to post product reviews on social media sites to comparing the best prices on smartphones while in a shop, consumers have never had so much power, writes Andrea Felsted.While in the past it was retailers who decided what customers wanted to buy and then put the goods in shops, today consumers hold the upper hand.Much of this has been driven by the ability to buy online. According to retail research group Verdict, UK online sales this year are set to account for £1 of every £8. Internet sales are also powering ahead in the US where, according to Bain & Company, the consultancy, online will account for just under 12 per cent of total sales by 2015.Some retail analysts suggest that with the rise of tablet computers and smartphones a second internet boom has taken place, as consumers can shop online more easily and frequently. Conlumino, the retail consultancy, says mobile accounted for 10.9 per cent of UK online retail sales in 2012.Smartphones are also enabling consumers to check prices online. They can be in one store but checking the price of a product in a competitor’s shop. This takes away from the retailer one of the traditional givens – that if a consumer was in your store at least you had some influence over them. Not any more.This is leading to the concept of showrooming, whereby shoppers go to a shop to test or examine a product before buying elsewhere, usually online. According to a survey from TNS, part of Kantar, the consumer research group, 33 per cent of people worldwide admit to showrooming.When it comes to the nuances of showrooming, some 43 per cent of people use their mobile to read product reviews while in store, but 31 per cent use their mobiles to compare prices, according to TNS. Some 14 per cent use their phones to check availability in other stores, while 14 per cent examine whether it is easier to order online.In the US, some shoe retailers, frustrated at consumers who try on shoes for fit in physical stores but buy them cheaper online, have dubbed these shoppers “fit-lifters”. But TNS says stores can still engage shoppers – and nudge them to the tills – even when they are surfing on their smartphones in the shops. It found that 38 per cent of people are interested in redeeming coupons on their mobile phones, while 30 per cent would like to receive coupons when they walk past a product.David Suddens, chief executive of R Griggs Group, the maker of Dr Martens footwear, says with the rise of multi-channel, it is the way of the world for retailers. “We have to let consumers do what they will do,” he says.…Customer segmentationSegmenting customers has long been a stock-in-trade for marketing people, writes Andrea Felsted. But an idea that changed the entire dynamics came in 1995, when Tesco, the UK’s biggest retailer, launched the Clubcard, a customer loyalty scheme that gave it a mass of data to mine about how people shop.Clubcard was developed by Terry Leahy, a marketing man by background who was to become Tesco chief executive in 1997. The scheme could not only analyse consumer habits but also spot gaps in Tesco’s offerings.A similar approach has been adopted around the world; in the US by, for example, Kroger, the supermarket chain. Meanwhile, in the intensely competitive UK supermarket sector, Tesco’s rival J Sainsbury uses the Nectar loyalty programme.In a market where shoppers are bombarded by vouchers and coupons, the loyalty schemes help retailers tailor offers to their customers.Janet Smith, Tesco’s head of group loyalty, has described untargeted offers, such as coupons printed in newspapers, as “bland”. In contrast, offers using Clubcard data give “customers discounts on the things they want to buy”.Justin King, Sainsbury chief executive, has said: “If you target [money-off vouchers], you will give customers coupons they value… It works very powerfully.” But a new frontier in segmentation is opening up: the information provided by online searches, or the products shoppers buy via the internet.Online searches can be used to build a detailed profile of a customer. For example, if a shopper is of a particular age or gender, he or she may need to buy certain products. This data could then be used to send consumers specific offers or promotions.The Office of Fair Trading, the UK consumer protection watchdog, is looking at whether online retailers are personalising prices to customers, based on factors such as their browsing history.Personalised pricing takes customer segmentation a stage further. The theory is that retailers may not offer just discounts and promotions, but also adjust the prices they offer to a website visitor based on the visitor’s past online behaviour or location.The OFT first looked at this issue in 2010 but found no evidence of this type of personalised pricing in the UK, although it recognised the area was still evolving. Consequently, it wants to understand the changes that have taken place since the 2010 study, to ensure regulatory controls keep pace with technology and business strategy."

But how far can you extend a brand?THE ADVICEThe brand expert: Rita CliftonAny business, whether a global corporation, a local business-to-business widget maker or an international film studio, wants to generate more returns for less risk – and that is exactly what a strong brand and effective brand extensions do.Stretching established brands is a more efficient way of generating value than launching new ones, with all their expense and uncertainty.However, you have to be clear what your brand equity is. Is it going to give you competitive advantage versus the competition in that new sector? Is the new product going to enhance or dilute your brand?Apple is the king here – it can offer people beautiful, functional design across their lives. But who wanted Harley-Davidson perfume, Bic underwear …or another Jaws?The writer is chairman of Populus——————————————-The author: Martin LindstromFor decades Hollywood has not only set the standard for how far brand extensions can go, but has also been the driver in educating consumers on why they can’t live without a Shrek lunchbox or a Twilight Band-Aid.Every year the bar for what is acceptable in brand extensions is set lower (there are even Hello Kitty bras), and only the limits of consumer fantasies determine how far brand owners can go. The key is to make sure the core values of your brand and the core purpose of your merchandise are still present.For example, if you use the Homer Simpson bottle opener, it plays a recording of “duh”. Now imagine if you replaced The Simpsons brand with Lego. Instead of “duh”, you’re more likely to say “huh”?The writer is the author of ‘Buyology’ and ‘Brandwashed’——————————————-The academic: Jonah BergerHollywood makes new movies about existing characters or stories because things such as GI Joe and Lord of the Rings have strong brand equity: consumers know the originals, so they value something else based on it. But brand extensions are also about fit – like restaurant dishes. Could a Chinese restaurant offer fried chicken? Sure. Would you want to buy fried chicken from a Chinese restaurant? Probably not.Nike has a strong, well-known brand, so it could extend into many domains. But toothpaste? Or even dress shoes? Those are too far from its known expertise, so brand fit is lower. Marketers must remember that consumers want to buy from an expert.The writer is an assistant professor of marketing at Wharton and author of ‘Contagious: Why Things Catch On’
49;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2013-01-07T00:03:16Z;Yoony Kim;The MBA graduate says the gender divide should be viewed as valuable diversity;"Yoony Kim is an MBA graduate of Nyenrode Business Universiteit in the Netherlands, where she now works as an international marketing manager.Born and raised in Seoul, South Korea, Ms Kim attended the Ewha Womans University before moving to London to study for a masters in marketing communications at the University of Westminster. She completed her MBA at Nyenrode in 2011 and has worked as a marketing manager at Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle manufacturer.In her spare time, Ms Kim enjoys cooking and exercising.1. What academic achievement are you most proud of?My MBA. It opened a completely new chapter for me, both professionally and personally. This is the magic of education, you not only gain the knowledge and skills for work but you also learn about yourself. You can identify where there is room for improvement and discover your hidden capabilities.2. What is the best piece of advice given to you by a teacher?If there is nothing further you can do to change the situation, giving up is no longer a shameful failure; it is a brave decision.3. What is your biggest lesson learnt?Happiness comes from within and it is close to impossible to make others happy if you are not happy yourself. Sometimes we tend to forget about ourselves and focus on making other people happy, which is all very well but how can you do so if you are feeling miserable?4. What would you do if you were dean for the day?I would make a point to attend as many classes as possible, to be with the students. I believe education is a very personal and life-changing experience and as an educational institution we can never do enough to be as personally relevant as possible.5. What is the worst job you have ever had?As a marketer, I sometimes faced the challenge of dealing with the “special” stakeholders. In my case, the most special ones were celebrities. I found it very difficult to understand what they really wanted, so I struggled to figure out how to assist them.6. What advice would you give to women in business?Consider gender differences as valuable diversity. Think “fair” rather than “equal”. I believe in embracing and enjoying differences. When you focus too much on being equal in the literal sense, you tend to think more about being the same. Why would you want to be the same when you could benefit more from being different? On the other hand, being fair allows you to acknowledge different circumstances, capabilities and competences. Only when these are considered can you bring out the best in each other, including yourself.7. How do you deal with male-dominated environments?I have a perfect example. As you may know, the motorcycle industry is an extremely male-dominated environment. Being a frontline player at Harley-Davidson in Korea – which is a male-dominated society anyway – could be considered challenging, but actually my gender was an advantage because I was a rare breed within the company. It was easier for me to be noticed while carrying out my roles and responsibilities. After I realised this, I could relax and be myself at work.8. What is the last book you read?I recently read a Korean book which has been translated into English as Please Look After Mom. It is a book about a love/hate relationship between a mother and her daughter and it has made me realise how important it is to acknowledge and appreciate the unconditional love of family.9. Who are your business heroes?During my time at Harley-Davidson there was an enthusiastic customer who had had a serious accident and could no longer ride his motorcycle. But despite this, he never stopped hoping he’d be able to ride again in the future. He was one of the happiest customers I knew. His story reached Harley-Davidson headquarters and he was presented with a customised motorcycle, specially designed for him to be able to ride. He then went on to found a company that supports people with similar physical challenges.10. What is your life philosophy?My life motto is “crazy, addictive and wild”. I believe that the people with the least regrets are the ones who have devoted themselves 100 per cent in every situation, so whether I’m dealing with a professional or a personal matter, I try to put my heart and soul into it. I also do not necessarily believe in luck. I think luck is an opportunity that is identified and explored by those who are ready to take it. So, if there is a goal you would like to achieve, make sure you are ready so you can act upon it immediately."
50;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2012-11-19T17:40:52Z;Corporate tales to boost sales;;"The customers camping outside an Apple store the night before a product launch are clearly interested in more than just the latest iPad: they are fans with a passion for everything the brand stands for. Consumers often make buying choices based on a brand’s values and culture, whether riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle or flying Virgin Atlantic. Now companies that sell to other businesses rather than consumers are also exploiting their thinking and values to stand out from the crowd.In marketing jargon this process is called “thought leadership marketing” – where businesses market their ideas, expertise, values and philosophy instead of merely their products. In contrast to traditional consumer brand marketing, this tactic aims to wrap up a company’s “big ideas” via a multitude of content using various channels both to engage and to educate its target audience.Creating content for customers is a key part of the strategy, with online information – from blog posts to downloadable reports – helping to build a long-term relationship between buyer and seller. The shipping company UPS, for example, created “the new logistics”, a website showing businesses how to use logistics to expand, covering considerations from customer service through to money-saving ideas.Ann Handley, chief content officer of MarketingProfs.com, an online resource for marketers, and author of Content Rules, recently published research showing that 91 per cent of business-to-business companies are incorporating content into their marketing. This content is not only
published online but also includes conferences and seminars where industry experts are brought together to discuss new ideas.“I think it’s more than a trend. I believe this will be a critical aspect of doing business for B2B,” says Jesse Noyes, managing editor at Eloqua. The marketing automation software company – clients include Siemens and Johnson & Johnson – hired Mr Noyes, a former business journalist, to create and deliver a series of marketing manuals and online content that is shared with clients. The Social Media ProBook, for example, is a
42-page ebook containing data, expertise, tips and opinion. When publications are such a hit, they are shared online by the marketing industry and grab attention in a noisy marketplace. Some of Eloqua’s ebooks have been viewed 90,000 times.●Make the most of your in-house experts. “Hire content producers and ‘brand journalists’ who are essentially embedded in your company – pulling those stories out, and crafting them for a larger audience,” says Ann Handley of MarketingProfs.com.●Put your customers first. “How can you help them shoulder their burdens, ease their pain? Your content should grow out of that – in other words, stop talking about yourself!” says Ms Handley.●Produce content that addresses the right questions. “Content is often about sharing what you know, not what you sell,” says Jesse Noyes, at Eloqua. Start a blog, a Facebook group, use question and answer forums.●Use social media to engage with your audience. Do not just tweet out links to your content. “Social media is about conversation, not a new bully pulpit. If you’re going to be part of the conversation, you need to bring something of value,” says Mr Noyes.Mr Noyes says content is helpful because business-to-business purchases often require a lot of research before a decision is made. “The buyer wants more than product specs and pricing data. They want to know the people they’re buying from know their space, understand their customers’ needs and jobs,” he says. Creating content “is the best way to position yourself as a smart group of people ready with an answer to clients’ most burning questions”.This is not new for consultants and professional services firms. For example, McKinsey Quarterly is the consultant’s business journal, which looks at management trends and ideas using content provided by its consultants and clients. Boston Consulting Group, meanwhile, has the online portal BCG Perspectives and Booz & Co publishes Strategy + Business magazine, its own quarterly.Similarly, Open View Venture Partners, a venture capital firm in Boston, recently created a website called Open View Labs as a resource to help entrepreneurs.Peter O’Neill, vice-president and principal analyst of B2B technology marketing at Forrester Research, says content and idea creation is an especially relevant marketing tool for technology companies. This is because many services such as cloud computing and marketing automation software can be difficult to grasp for executives. “It is a way to stand out from the competition, create interest and earn the trust of potential buyers early in their problem-solving process. This makes them more likely to seek that firm when they enter the actual buying cycle,” he says.American Express’s Open, the small-business division of the credit card company, publishes an online hub providing advice and networking opportunities. Not only does the site try to build long-term relationships with clients by producing content the small businesses are unlikely to find elsewhere, but that information is then shared among the community via social media. The forum has 193,000 Twitter followers.Using content to establish deeper relationships with customers is ultimately a way of reframing the sales process. Because business-to-business deals can take a long time to close, vendors need to start building the relationship by sharing expertise; selling the features and benefits can come later.“In the B2B world, you are often talking about a long-term complex sale – 18 to 24 months is not uncommon. So at the awareness phase, it is less effective to talk about benefits and price because (quite often) you are talking through a buyer’s pain points,” says Ms Handley.Producing content is a way to demonstrate empathy with the challenges faced by clients. “Buyers want to be convinced that their suppliers understand their business and their issues,” says Mr O’Neill. “Even if the products are commodities, they care about other factors like reliability, quality and relationship.”In her book, Ms Handley tells the story of Hubspot, a supplier of marketing software, which published a video online called Dude, cold calling is for losers in 2008. The video risked alienating those in their audience who use cold-calling; but in taking such a provocative stance the video amassed more than 66,000 views on YouTube and many comments on the company blog.“Thought leadership really just means acting as a resource to your prospects and customers,” says Ms Handley. “In other words, you solve problems for them, you share resources with them – all with an eye toward helping. And not purely ‘selling’.”Another benefit is that, unlike business-to-consumer relationships, where customers can usually switch from one supplier to another, long, fixed contracts mean it is often difficult to break business-to-business relationships.“When you decide as a company to embrace marketing automation, you need to think long-term. It’s not a one-shot decision with minor impact,” says Alexandre Papillaud, marketing operations manager for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at McAfee, the cyber security company and one of Eloqua’s customers. “You need to trust your vendor, not only the product, but also their thinking. How do they see marketing in future, how can they be innovative for me so I can beat the competition?”Of course, he adds, a business cannot hide a poor product behind a good idea. “Thinking is great but me and my team need something that works, is easy to use and efficient. Thinking is not what will make my business run,” he says."
51;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2012-11-02T18:31:22Z;First Person: Niven Ladd;‘I still ride a Chopper even though I’m 54’;"Most people of my age will remember the Chopper from their childhood, thanks to the distinctive handlebars and banana-shaped seat. It’s the bicycle that every child wanted back in the early 1970s. Even today, I don’t feel out of place riding mine. I own 10 now – and even ride a girls’ model from time to time. People just smile or wave as I pedal by; nobody laughs. My bikes are quite a talking point among teenagers, because all they have are BMX and racer bikes. There’s never been another two-wheeler quite like the Raleigh Chopper.I got mine for Christmas in 1971, when I was 12. The box was too big to fit under the Christmas tree, and I had no idea what was inside. When I pulled it apart and found a Chopper, I was totally gobsmacked. It was a three-speed Mk I model, painted in standard orange with big, chunky tyres. I can’t remember much else about that day, apart from the fact that I went straight out and rode my Chopper up and down the street until teatime. My dad worked in construction at the time, so he and Mum must have scrimped and saved to raise the £53 to buy it.The Chopper was designed by Alan Oakley, who based it on the Harley-Davidson ridden by Peter Fonda’s character in Easy Rider. That’s why it was such a cool bike, because the high handlebars made it look like a “chopper” motorcycle from the film. It was such a radical style that I think Raleigh was brave to even consider putting it into production. Up until then, bicycles all had the same style of frame – the Chopper was totally out there and had a touch of Hell’s Angel about it. The gear-change was revolutionary. Instead of a thumb lever on the handlebars, the Chopper had a car-like gear-stick on the crossbar, which was inspired. More expensive models had five- or 10-speed options.The Chopper was a brilliant-looking bike but it did have a few design flaws. Riding home from school was a nightmare for me because I had to cycle up a big hill with only three gears. The small wheels also meant my legs were spinning really fast but my friends could all overtake on their racers. But while I couldn’t go as quickly, my Chopper was great for pulling wheelies – I just had to lean back on the banana seat and the front wheel would lift up in the air.The long saddle was also perfect for giving a “backie”, or carrying a friend. That changed in 1972, when Raleigh moved the seat forward on the Mk II model for safety reasons. The Chopper died in the late 1970s when the BMX craze started. A Mk III model was launched in 2004 but it was rubbish and never took off.Unfortunately, the original Chopper had a structural weakness in the frame, which meant that mine rusted away in 1986. I was still living with my parents near Maidstone, in Kent, and I forgot all about Choppers for 10 years, until I read an article on them in a classic car magazine. My brother, Sheldon, had also ridden a Chopper as a child and I discovered his bike tucked away in the family shed. It was covered in dust but just needed a good clean-up. Not long after that, I started looking around for parts and old Choppers on the internet – and I became totally obsessed with them because they were such a special part of my childhood.Some of my Choppers are worth a lot of money. A Mk I three-speed is worth from £500 upwards, and my 10-gear model has been valued at £5,000. Except for the rubbish Mk III, which I got rid of, I own every type of Chopper ever made, including a customised chrome model, so I don’t want any more. The bikes are just a hobby and I work full-time as a coach trimmer on classic cars. I’m also a bit of a perfectionist and like my freedom, which might explain why I never married. If the sun is out, I still like nothing better than taking my Chopper out for a ride."
52;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2012-10-23T20:36:46Z;Production delays drag Harley-Davidson;;Harley-Davidson’s third-quarter profits fell by almost a third as motorcycle shipments slowed amid disruptions to production at its largest factory because of a technology upgrade.The Milwaukee-based company said net income fell to $134m in the three months to September 30, or 59 cents per share, from $183.6m, or 78 cents per share, the same quarter a year ago.The motorcycle manufacturer, which has spent the last few years streamlining its business to improve profitability, is introducing a new production system at its York, Pennsylvania facility to boost efficiency and allow the company to better respond to fluctuating market demand.“A major piece of our restructuring work is behind us,” said Keith Wandell, chief executive. “We believe Harley-Davidson is on track to deliver growth through our strategy, with investments in new markets, new products and improved manufacturing and retail capabilities.”Shares in the company rose 7.7 per cent to $46.89 by market closeUS motorcycle sales declined 5.2 per cent because of a limited availability of new motorcycles in July, August and early September.Harley has sought to expand its market share outside the US and international sales rose 7.6 per cent, offsetting some US weakness. Global motorcycle sales fell 1.3 per cent.Revenue generated by motorcycles and related products decreased 12 per cent to $1.09bn.Harley stood by its earnings guidance for the year, forecasting a 5 to 7 per cent increase in motorcycle shipments compared with 2011.The company has stepped up its marketing efforts to attract new kinds of customers such as women, ethnic minorities and young adults – groups that have not been traditionally seen as typical Harley-Davidson riders.“Their market share among women, black and Hispanic riders as well as younger customers has improved. It’s a pretty effective strategy,” said James Hardiman, analyst at Longbow Research, ahead of the earnings release. “ International sales have been a boost for the company as well.”In Latin America, Harley saw 16 consecutive months of double-digit growth led by Brazil and Mexico, while Japan, Australia, China and India also saw gains.Gross margin rose to 34.7 per cent from 33.7 per cent in the same quarter in 2011. The company said it expected a downward pressure on gross margins in the next several quarters due to currency fluctuations.Operating margin from motorcycles and related products was 13.3 per cent, compared with 14.7 per cent in last year’s third quarter.
53;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2012-08-23T20:11:12Z;New road for a macho brand;;At an upscale midtown Manhattan bar earlier this month, a throng of specially invited female bloggers are greeted with cocktails, pumping music and videos on large screens showing youthful, beautiful women with windswept hair riding majestic looking motorcycles. Some of the attendees learn how to straddle, shift and roll the throttle on a partially disabled sports bike, while others cheer each other on as they follow instructions on how to squat, grip and rock a fallen bike upright.The event is part of a drive by Harley-Davidson Motor Company to revamp the company’s image and extend the brand to women. The stereotype of Harley-Davidson motorcycle owners – or hogs – has been of bulky, white men over the age of 40, with even bulkier two-wheelers. But demonstrations such as the one in New York have been offered at women’s garage parties and other events around the country. The 109-year-old Milwaukee-based motorcycle manufacturer has been reaching out to women as well as ethnic minorities and younger riders, as its core constituency of male baby boomers declines through old age.“It’s about changing perception,” says Claudia Garber, Harley-Davidson’s director of women’s marketing outreach. She says the company wants to understand better what women feel about the Harley brand, addressing issues that may have kept them away. “Many women assume that they cannot handle a Harley, due to the size and weight,” she explains.More than 750 garage parties for women were hosted by Harley-Davidson dealers last year. These show-and- tell outreach events have also been combined with female-friendly training and a marketing drive heavily focused on women’s empowerment, featuring advertising slogans such as “Freedom. Adventure. Camaraderie. Will you answer the call?”Harley-Davidson already dominates the US women’s motorcycle sector, last year boasting a market share of more than 65 per cent among women who are white and over 35 years old. It created its first “women’s community” several years ago to provide information and inspiration to women who wanted to learn to ride. But this year it has launched a women-specific campaign online and in print.It has also created dedicated marketing teams to service the new customer segments. However, one challenge has been to make sure its core customer base remains suitably looked after and does not feel alienated by any perceived “feminisation” of such a staple, macho brand.Dino Bernacchi, director of marketing communications for North America at Harley-Davidson, says the advertising for the women’s campaign contains the same messages present in the company’s regular advertising material. “There is a common denominator in the passion, the self expression, personal freedom and about living life your way,” he says.Doug Spong, president of Carmichael Lynch, which until 2010 held Harley-Davidson’s advertising account for 31 years, agrees. “The company has to speak to the core and has to let others listen in,” he explains. “All Harley riders – whether it be women, young riders or members of the Hispanic or African American communities – have a shared mindset.”Mr Spong notes that other traditionally masculine companies such as carmaker Porsche have succeeded in extending their brands to women. Porsche’s 2002, Stuttgart-designed SUV, the Cayenne, tapped into the female market while maintaining its sleek designs and record-setting performance. “These women still had that Porsche attitude,” he explains. “They didn’t want a low horsepower hatchback mommy vehicle. They wanted something fun, cool, fast and powerful, but they also wanted to put a kid and a car seat and some groceries in the back.”A similar dynamic was at play when Gillette extended its brand to women with the introduction of its Venus range of products. Then, the common denominator that was emphasised in the branding and marketing was Gillette’s pedigree and expertise in shaving technology, skin and hair. Nonetheless, there are key differences that highlight the challenge faced by Harley-Davidson.First, Gillette created a new brand in Venus that could be marketed and packaged differently from men’s products while still retaining Gillette’s name. In addition, Gillette points out that about half of the men’s grooming products sold are actually bought by women shopping for their husbands, sons or boyfriends. “So there was already that idea of marketing a male brand to women without softening or feminising the brand,” the company says. Finally, after the company was bought by Procter & Gamble in 2005 – a year after Venus was launched – it was helped by the larger group’s broader experience marketing to women.While Harley-Davidson’s own efforts to reach out to women have been widely praised, some argue the company has taken the wrong approach in its communication. “Tagines such as ‘Don’t just go along for the ride’, to put it crudely, sound like they were written by a man patting a woman on the head,” says Steve Centrillo, co-founder and managing partner of Smiths, a New York-based advertising firm.Other advertising experts say that by segmenting its new target markets, Harley-Davidson risks putting off potential consumers. “By creating a separate part of the website just for women or African Americans for example, you’re saying to that person they are not your core customer. Rather than being inclusive, you are saying this is where you belong,” says David Prince, a social media strategist and multicultural strategic planner at Consultant.Nonetheless, women in the US motorcycle industry have welcomed the company’s inclusion of them in its advertising material. Jan Plessner, editor of LadyMoto.com and a former Kawasaki public relations manager, says other manufacturers are likely to learn from Harley-Davidson’s initiative. “Women have for a long time been so absent from advertising campaigns and now these motorcycle manufacturers are slowly waking up to this huge untapped market. We will see more from these companies in the next few years,” she says.…Beyond advertising, there are also lessons in the area of product design. Harley-Davidson has pushed the option of customisation rather than risk pigeonholing women by pushing them towards women-only bikes. The company has been helped by the fact that many female riders prefer the lower-seated motorcycles for which it is famous.“By and large, women don’t have the same stature and size of bikes as men but again, they have the same mindset as the man,” says Mr Spong. “She wants to ride the same bike he does, they aren’t a ‘special need’. The company has to retain the DNA of the brand. After all, this was one of the first logos of a company people thought to tattoo on themselves.”

Shares plummeted 32.8 per cent to $6.94.The S&P 500 struggled higher as the day opened but fell as much as 0.5 per cent before paring back some of its losses. The benchmark index closed 0.3 per cent down at 1,375.34.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed 0.3 per cent lower at 12,977.13, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,920.21.Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, noted that many observers were already expecting the Fed to take action next month rather than in August because the most important issues facing markets remained in Europe.Market commentator Mike Ingram of BGC Partners also continued to focus on European monetary policy, noting: “Supportive statements from the leaders of France and Germany have helped to maintain the momentum and create the expectation that we are about to see some game-changing move in the ongoing eurozone crisis saga.”No single sector dominated on Wednesday as trading patterns fluctuated throughout the day. By the market’s close, nine out of 10 sectors on Wall Street were in negative territory.In healthcare, Humana rallied 4.8 per cent to $63.91. The shares traded at an all-time low on Tuesday after the US health insurance company lowered its full-year outlook.In materials, DuPont, one of the world’s largest chemical companies, saw its shares rally in the morning session after it was reported that Monsanto’s $1bn suit over patent infringement would go to a jury. However, the stock gave up most of the gains to close 0.5 per cent higher to $49.94,United States Steel added 4.6 per cent to $21.61 while Dow Chemical rose 1.8 per cent to $29.30.One of Wall Street’s best performers on Wednesday was Frontier Communications, whose shares rose 10.7 per cent to $4.34. The phone and internet provider to consumers and businesses in rural and small towns beat analysts’ earnings estimates.The telecoms sector continues to be Wall Street’s strongest performing sector, with the S&P telecom index gaining 20 per cent in the year to date.Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, rose 3 per cent to $33.55 after reporting a 6 per cent increase to $9.9bn in cable revenue over the second quarter. The largest US cable network by market capitalisation has gained more than 40 per cent since the beginning of the year.Direct rival Time Warner, which owns television networks such as HBO, reversed earlier losses to rise 1.2 per cent to $39.60, despite missing earnings estimates.The automotive sector was also in the spotlight as carmaker GM is due to release earnings on Thursday. GM shares traded 0.2 per cent higher at $19.66, while rival Ford lost 2.2 per cent to $9.04.The industry was buoyed by strong second-quarter sales news from Chrysler, which saw a 13 per cent rise in sales in July, its best performance in that month in the past five years.GM and Ford, however, did not fare as well over the month, reporting a 6 per cent and a 4 per cent drop in US fleet purchases, respectively.In other earnings news, Harley-Davidson shares fell 3.6 per cent to $41.67 after reporting better than expected earnings, but the group lowered its outlook for the year’s second half.There was grim news from MasterCard, which saw its shares decrease by 2.2 per cent to $427.20 after it reported worse than expected net revenues and it issued a warning of a worldwide slowdown in consumption.In technology, Facebook and Zynga continued to hit record lows. Shares in the social networking site fell 3.8 per cent to $20.00, while the games manufacturer slid 4.8 per cent to $2.81.Bank stocks were mixed. Bank of America closed 1.6 per cent lower at $7.22, Wells Fargo added 0.3 per cent to $33.90 and JPMorgan Chase was unchanged at $36.00.
55;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2012-08-01T15:23:34Z;Harley-Davidson profits rev up;;Harley-Davidson’s second-quarter net profits rose by 30 per cent on higher motorcycle sales in the US and abroad, but its shares fell following a cautious growth outlook on the back of worries emanating from Europe.The Milwaukee-based company reported net income of $247.3m, or $1.07 a share, up from $190.6m, or 81 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Earnings were 2 cents a share higher than analysts’ expectations.But Keith Wandell, chief executive, said that Harley-Davidson was taking a more guarded view on growth in the second half of the year, as the company faces a challenging eurozone economy, which is affecting sales, and currency headwinds.“We’re being cautious in our expectations for retail in the back half of the year, given the economic uncertainty in many markets,” said Mr Wandell on an earnings call with analysts.Shares fell 4.53 per cent to $41.67, after falling more than 10 per cent in early New York trading. The New York Stock Exchange said it was reviewing 148 stocks, including Harley-Davidson, after numerous companies saw sharp swings in their prices in the first 45 minutes of trading.The company has stepped up its efforts to attract new kinds of customers such as women, ethnic minorities and young adults– groups that have not been traditionally seen as typical Harley-Davidson riders.In the three months to July 1, global retail sales of new motorcycles were up 2.8 per cent, including growth of 4 per cent in the US.The company has been streamlining its manufacturing since early 2009 and has sought to expand its market share outside the US.Retail sales rose 10 per cent in the Asia Pacific region and 37.9 per cent in Latin America, offsetting weaker demand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where sales fell by 6.4 per cent.In the second quarter, the company incurred restructuring charges of $6.2m. Revenues generated by motorcycles and related products increased 17 per cent to $1.57bn year-on-year. Gross margin rose to 35.9 per cent from 35 per cent.Motorcycle shipments improved 25 per cent to 83,502. The company expects to ship 51,000 to 56,000 motorcycles in the current quarter, a decrease from the year-earlier period, due to expected disruptions to production at its plant in York, Pennsylvania, where the company is installing new software.But Harley-Davidson affirmed its estimated shipments for the year saying it expects to ship 245,000 to 250,000 motorcycles to dealers and distributors worldwide in 2012, a 5 to 7 per cent increase on 2011.
56;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2012-04-25T18:37:52Z;Harley-Davidson profits up 44%;;Harley-Davidson said first-quarter net profit rose by 44 per cent as the US motorcycle manufacturer reported better than expected US sales.Shares in the company rose nearly 6 per cent by 2pm in New York after the company said it had been helped by an improved economic climate and younger customers embracing the brand.Net income rose to $172m, or 74 cents per share, from $119m, or 51 cents per share, for the same quarter a year before. Analysts had expected earnings at about 72 cents per share.“We continue to be encouraged by the strong trend at retail and in earnings over the past several quarters. Our first-quarter performance reflects the outstanding appeal of our products, the ongoing results of our transformation strategy, the efforts of our dealers and employees, and improving macroeconomic conditions in the US,” said Keith Wandell, chief executive.Worldwide product sales, including motorcycles, parts and accessories, jumped 20 per cent to $1.27bn year on year, beating expectations of $1.22bn. Sales were led by a 26 per cent increase in the US.Harley-Davidson said more than a third of new motorcycle sales in US and two-thirds in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in 2011 were to riders new to the brand.Analysts said the company had been trying to increase its market share in the US over the past five years by reaching out to younger customers, women and ethnic minorities through its advertising campaigns.“There have been growth concerns about the company as what happens when their core customers, the baby boomers, stop buying? The company is seeing faster growth with their outreach customers,” said Edward Aaron, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Gerrick Johnson, analyst at BMO Capital Markets said: “With high gas prices, younger people are more attracted to motorcycles. The average car gets 13 miles to the gallon, where it is over 50 miles for the average Harley-Davidson bike.”“The company is making a concerted effort to reach new demographics and tailoring products specifically targeting women or the younger rider for example,” he added.The Milwaukee-based company raised its shipping expectations for 2012 from 245,000 to 250,000 motorcycles worldwide this year, reflecting increased consumer demand. The company added it had “limited ability” to produce any additional motorcycles next year.Harley-Davidson reiterated that restructuring activities initiated in 2009 would result in one-time overall costs of up to $520m through to 2013, including costs of $50m to $60m in 2012.

Stocks recovered later in the week as a resolution to a Greek debt restructuring deal was reached and strong non-farm payroll employment data from the US supported hopes of a labour market recovery.China’s two largest online video providers, Youku and Tudou, soared as the US-listed companies announced an all-share merger on Monday that raised the prospect of creating a profitable market leader. Shares in larger Youku climbed 27.4 per cent to $31.85, while smaller rival Tudou jumped 156.5 per cent to $39.48.Banks were leading the losers with the benchmark index’s financials off by as much as 0.8 per cent as the day began with reports that Greece’s new bonds – following last week’s debt swap – were trading at distressed levels. Citigroup recovered early day losses and ended up 0.3 per cent to $34.29, while Wells Fargo dropped 0.5 per cent to $31.51. Bank of America fell below the $8 threshold, down 0.8 per cent to $7.99 and Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $18.20.But volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, continued to fall, down 7 per cent to 15.92. The Vix, or Wall Street “fear gauge”, climbed above 20 before resettling last week as fears of global economic woes crept back into the market.The S&P 500 utilities index was the best performing sector, up 1.1 per cent. Gains were led by Constellation Energy, which added 3 per cent to $37.23 and Edison International, which climbed 1.8 per cent to $43.69.The Nasdaq Composite index moved down 0.2 per cent to 2,983.66, edging away from the 3,000 mark that it eclipsed two weeks ago for the first time since the dotcom boom. The Nasdaq fell despite gains by Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the index. The company finished up 1.3 per cent to $552.Oracle, the software company, lost 1.4 per cent to $29.71 after Jefferies lowered its rating from “buy” to “hold”.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.3 per cent to 12,959.71. The blue-chip heavy index was led by ExxonMobil, which rose 1.5 per cent to $85.55. The oil company was reported as having reached an agreement for payments with the government of Iraq for work on an oilfield in West Qurna.Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, climbed 0.2 per cent to $29.84 after being upgraded from “hold” to “buy” by Nomura.“Lowe’s has begun to make tough decisions . . . In many ways, it is following what Home Depot did three years earlier when it slowed growth, shut stores, cut costs and addressed inventory. The bottom line is that Lowe’s has begun to play offence,” said Aram Rubinson, analyst at Nomura.Rival home improvement group Home Depot was up 0.5 per cent at $48.59 even as Nomura maintained its “hold” rating on the company’s shares.United Continental Holdings, the parent of United Airlines, was down 1 per cent to $19.62 after analysts at Bank of America downgraded shares in the recently merged company from “buy” to “hold”, citing oil prices. Southwest Airlines, another US carrier, fell 2.4 per cent to $8.28.Harley-Davidson, the iconic motorcycle maker, hit a 52-week high and closed up 2.6 per cent to $48.11 after analysts at Citigroup raised its price target.Confectioner Hershey gained 1.8 per cent to $60.56. The chocolate maker was upgraded from “hold” to “buy” by equity analysts at Goldman Sachs Investor Research.Michael Kors, the retail group, fell by as much as 5.8 per cent before finishing down 2.1 per cent to $48.57. The company, which went public last December, said shareholders had agreed to waive lock-up restrictions with underwriters.American Apparel rose 21.5 per cent to $0.91 on a report that George Soros was considering offering a credit line to the struggling retailer.
58;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2012-03-06T17:28:00Z;Four wheels good, two wheels better;Carmakers increasingly are recognising the potential in motorcycles for the urban market;"In the motor industry, as in most others, the easy option is silo thinking. For many carmakers, that means four is the only number of wheels they will countenance on their bandwagon.Yet there are lessons from the motorcycle world that carmakers should heed, especially as they wrestle with the idea that quadrupling the world’s car population to 4bn over the next four decades could bring not just traffic but also their industry to a standstill.But the good news is that this path could put enjoyment back into motoring. Some of the cars I have driven recently are outstanding compared with their predecessors, let alone the vehicles of a few years ago. But congested, unintelligently policed roads make any car – no matter how smart or high-performing – a trial to drive.One of the reasons for the silo thinking is that relatively few makers of four-wheelers are involved in making two-wheelers. Honourable exceptions include, in Japan, Honda and Suzuki. And in Europe, Peugeot with its scooters, plus BMW with an increasingly dynamic range.But, more normally, car designers come up with machines like the risible Dodge Tomahawk concept bike. Even BMW, which should have known better, produced the C1 enclosed scooter that was, while being visionary in parts, flawed in execution. And disappointing in sales.There are a few factors, though, that indicate some thinking outside the usual silos. One is BMW’s launch of a pair of big-engined scooters – following in the tracks of all the Japanese and Italian bike makers with the sort of machines that are wildly popular in many continental European countries as well as Japan.Another is the planned sale of Italy’s Ducati – the two-wheel brand that probably has the greatest cachet after Harley-Davidson but produces machinery that is much more innovative than that of its US rival. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz of Germany are said to be interested.A third is the success in sales and margin terms of low-cost, entry-level cars from, for example, Dacia in Europe and Tata and others in Asia. The two-wheeled counterparts of such cars are, of course, an area of core competence for the likes of the Japanese motorcycle makers, although some of their European rivals, such as Ducati, long ago left that end of the market.South-east Asia shows how motorcycles can be a central part of any mobility solution. Laos and Cambodia, where I travelled recently, are also a reminder that small-capacity motorcycles – which the developed world tends to reserve for learners – are central.There is not much you cannot carry on even a lightweight motorcycle with a bit of ingenuity and maybe a willing accomplice sitting on the back: a plate-glass window for a shop-front; an extensive food stall, complete with gas burners and cold-drinks cabinet; an entire family complete with a young child sprawled across his father’s lap, just one of four on the 90cc bike, eating breakfast from a Styrofoam container.It could be argued that this is just a stage in a country’s mobility evolution – and people will ditch the bikes for cars as soon as they can. There is evidence for that, not just in the recent history of European countries, but also in present-day India.But then other factors come into play. Heavily congested cities such as Paris and London indicate that even when the weather is far from ideal for perching atop a means of conveyance, two-wheelers can come back into favour. The runaway success of the tilting, three-wheel Piaggio MP3 scooter attests to that.Some carmakers have tried to capture motorcycle benefits such as a small footprint and minimal use of raw materials with attempts at small four-wheelers, with seats for one or two. But they stop short of the answer – tilting, enclosed motorcycles, such as the MonoTracer from Swiss company Peraves, or its new electric version, the E-Tracer, go much further. They are exciting to drive, but the main problem with these low-volume products is their high price.But with the financial backing of a big carmaker – and the carrot that the long-term survival of the industry, rather than just saturating one undeveloped market after another until they run out, is key – prices should come down.Any discussion of the role of two-wheelers cannot ignore the safety aspects – preferably without the shrillness of those who imagine that a world without injury or death on the road is possible. Cabin motorcycles can be a big step forward in this respect.But two-wheelers also have much to learn from four-wheelers. Electronic rider aids such as traction control and anti-lock brakes took longer to reach the world of motorcycles and scooters, but they are fast becoming more widespread.Bikes will always fall over at a standstill without a supporting leg, a sidestand or retracting wheels (as in the Peraves machines). But that is a good reminder of the real issue in safety: any number of lane-departure warnings or anti-lock brakes cannot make up for poorly trained or inattentive users.That also represents the opportunity for enthusiasts. A ride on a two-wheeler is rarely as boring or dull as driving even the best car in gridlocked traffic will be. Add a little more safety and comfort to the two-wheel mix, and that’s a potent combination for drivers – and for the industry.For more articles and features on the car industry, go to www.ft.com/future-car-2012"
59;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2011-12-14T17:12:16Z;Two-tier system divides US carmaker workers;;"Elisa Gurule struggles to get by on the money she earns attaching fenders and bumpers to Chrysler and Dodge cars. She and her 10-year-old son were forced to move in with her mother this year because she could no longer afford her home.“I can’t live on $15 an hour,” she says.Ms Gurule’s frustration with her wages is exacerbated by the fact that many of her colleagues at the assembly plant in Sterling Heights, north of Detroit, do the same work yet are paid almost twice as much and enjoy far more generous benefits.North American employers increasingly demand that new recruits accept much lower wages than longer-serving workers doing the same jobs, putting the labour movement – eager to secure jobs in a weak economy, boost membership and protect workers’ rights – on the horns of a dilemma.The two-tier system “creates divisions among the workforce which doesn’t do anybody any good”, Ms Gurule says.This divide is not only straining shop floor traditions but has the potential to feed wider tensions in US society. “We’re going to be losing the middle class as we know it, and the result will be the politics of resentment in this country,” says John Russo, co-director at the Center for Working-Class Studies at Youngstown State University in Ohio.The number of lower paid workers is likely to rise over the next few years, he says. “You have a large number of people who are retiring who didn’t take earlier buy-outs. They’ll be replaced either by second-tier or, now, third-tier workers,” he added, referring to fears that another strata of employees who work fewer hours is emerging.The difficult choices faced by both unions and employees was encapsulated by a recent vote in which Ms Gurule joined tens of thousands of other workers at Chrysler, General Motors and Ford Motor to endorse new labour contracts that raise some wages but enshrine the two-tier system at the three Detroit carmakers for at least the next four years.The practice of lower pay for new recruits first flourished during the Reagan administration in the 1980s as companies facing competition persuaded unions to retreat from their once-inviolate principle of “equal pay for equal work”. More than 40 per cent of all labour contracts that expired in 1996 contained two-tier pay provisions, according to BNA, a business and legal publisher. Many of these early initiatives fizzled out as the economy improved.The two-tier system made a comeback about a decade ago, notably among hard-pressed automotive parts suppliers. Delphi and Visteon, once part of GM and Ford Motor, forced the United Auto Workers trade union to accept lower pay for new hires in 2003. Others, such as Harley-Davidson and Köhler, followed suit. Now BNA estimates that 20 per cent of US workers were covered by two-tier wage provisions last year, though it cautions that its surveys are based on a relatively small sample.Wages should be competitive, said Sergio Marchionne, Chrysler’s chief executive, but he sees the flaws in a two-tier system. “The whole notion of trying to get this organisation to work in unison when you’ve got this kind of economic disparity between the people on the line is not something that can go on forever,” he says. Despite his reservations, Chrysler expects to raise the proportion of tier-two workers in its plants from 13 per cent now to at least 25 per cent by 2015.For the unions, a two-tier system could help them staunch declining membership as it encourages carmakers and others to hire new people. The UAW’s membership rose last year for the first time in six years. Even so, at 377,000, it stands at little more than half the level of 2001.“These are certainly challenging times,” says Thea Lee, deputy chief of staff at the AFL-CIO labour federation. “With the loss of so many jobs in unionised sectors, like manufacturing and construction, it poses a threat to our survival.” She added: “When the economy is weak and unemployment is high it makes it difficult to negotiate a strong contract.""The latest contracts in Detroit represent a move to narrow the gap. Ms Gurule’s wages should rise from $15 to $19 an hour by 2015 and she should benefit from improved healthcare.The carmakers and the UAW are sure to face pressure to dismantle the two-tier system when the next contracts are negotiated in 2015. But with labour costs at GM, Ford and Chrysler now close to those of the non-union Japanese and European-owned plants in the southern US, carmakers are unlikely to want the gap to widen again. Companies in other sectors battered by foreign competition are sure to take a similar line.Additional reporting by Jeremy Lemer"

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
61;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2011-12-01T22:47:57Z;Corporate logos get under consumers’ skin;Some customers are branding themselves;When Steve Jobs died earlier this year, Paul Talbot, a tattoo artist and graphic designer in the Midlands, decided to commemorate his passing.“I’m a huge Apple fanboy and I run a tattoo studio, so I had an Apple logo tattooed on my foot,” he says. “My wife Karen had one on her ankle.”Mr Talbot chose the company’s 1976-98 rainbow logo and says he went as far as to ensure the font he used to write “R.I.P.” under the Apple was the one used by the company in the 1980s.Mr Talbot is not alone in decorating his skin with the Cupertino-based company’s trademark. Terry Johnston, a freelance photographer in Michigan, had a modern Apple logo inked on to his wrist in 2005. He too describes himself as an aficionado. “I’ve been an Apple loyalist for years,” he says. “I’ve grown up working with [Apple devices]. The tattoo gets a lot of attention and even though I have others, it’s the one people always comment on.”Mr Johnston is in the process of having his arms covered in what tattooists describe as “sleeves”, but the Apple on his wrist will remain the only logo. “Some of my older tattoos will be covered up. But I’ve said, ‘You can’t go over the Apple logo. You have to work round it’,” he says.Not many brands inspire this kind of devotion. Harley-Davidson, Apple and Nike are among those that people regularly ink on to their skin.A quick Google search will reveal other examples such as Microsoft Windows, Google, Facebook Dell and some designer logos, but these are relatively rare.“People get tattoos for three reasons: love, loyalty and bravado,” says Amy Krakow, author of The Total Tattoo Book and founder of New York-based Propaganda Marketing Communications.“If you’re an Apple fan, you own a computer that has only 8 per cent of the market. Apple is also the most emotional brand in the world. So you have love and loyalty there.”For Harley-Davidson, another much tattooed brand, the motivators are similar, even if the demographic is very different. “A lot of bikers got them when tattoos were very out of favour. Harley tattoos play to love, loyalty and bravado too,” she adds.And the online casino Goldenpalace.com paid Karolyne Smith of Utah to have its name tattooed on her forehead in what was undoubtedly a highly successful publicity stunt.Social changes have also propelled growth in the popularity of branded body art. Tattoos have become far more widespread and acceptable than 20 years ago. “I know a lot of tattooists who’ve made so much they’ve retired,” says Ms Krakow.On the corporate side, people also now identify more closely with brands, in a way that they might once have identified with religions or groups or organisations such as the armed forces.Ms Krakow adds that tattoos often signify a rite of passage: “If you’re a member of the US marines, you get a ‘Semper Fi’ tattoo . . . so if you’ve made a fortune in an IPO, you might get a logo tattoo.”Cory Doctorow, the blogger and science-fiction author, had a “sad Mac” tattooed on a bicep to commemorate a marathon seven-day data recovery effort.Still, there are pitfalls. Corporate tattoos age: any MySpace and Windows XP tattoos are almost certainly looking a little passé.As Ms Krakow points out: “If you’re working for a company, it might not seem such a good idea when you change jobs.”Also, people’s feelings about brands change.Still, there is a long tradition of altering tattoos. As Scott Perry, a branding expert, puts it: “You could always change the RIP under the Apple symbol to read RIP OFF.”
62;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2011-11-28T18:05:34Z;Manaus: Free trade zone is jungle capital’s passport to success;Joe Leahy says the city should focus on transport links, not rely on tax breaks;"At the Fiam international investment fair, models drape themselves over the latest motorcycles, which range from Brazilian-made Dafra and Chinese-owned Kasinski, to Harley-Davidson and Honda, the US and Japanese manufacturers.Gleaming South Korean and Japanese-brand flat screen televisions are on display alongside expensive smartphones.The surprising thing is, we are deep in the Amazon jungle, in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state and the country’s improbable centre of consumer goods production. By air, the journey time to Miami is little longer that to São Paulo.Originally founded to exploit the jungle, the old rubber capital is today being held up as a counter-intuitive solution to deforestation in the Amazon.By providing tax breaks that encourage industrial development in the area, the government has created urban jobs for labourers who might otherwise have been out logging or starting illegal farms.Adalberto Luis Val, director of Inpa, the national institute for Amazonian research in Manaus, says: “This generates social inclusion and so reduces the pressure that people put on the forest. We should find alternatives like that for other places.”Located near the encontro das aguas, where two mighty arms of the Amazon river meet, Manaus had its heyday during the rubber boom of the late 19th and early 20th century, when rubber was the most important commodity export in Brazil after coffee.Some of the city’s most impressive monuments, such as the pink-and-white opera house, date from this period, when fabulously rich rubber barons imported acts from overseas.After smuggling out seeds, the British eventually started producing rubber in Asia, sending Manaus into decline, until it was revived by the governments of the 1960s. They were afraid that if Brazil did not populate the Amazon region, someone else might.In order to encourage settlement, the federal government awarded the city a system of import-duty and fiscal incentives, offering generous relief from a taxation system widely seen as one of the world’s most burdensome.Manufacturers flocked to the city. Today, Manaus has a population of 2m and, with its heavy traffic, concrete towers and flashy shopping malls, it looks like a suburb of São Paulo, even though it has few transport links to the outside world, other than the river and an airport.Ironically, this scheme was even less successful at achieving the aim of populating the state than initiatives by previous governments. With 95 per cent forest cover, it remains one of the best-preserved parts of the Amazon. This is partly because much of the state is subject to seasonal floods, but officials claim that the zona franca, or free-trade zone, has also helped.Today, the zona franca employs 120,000 people directly and 500,000 indirectly. It produces most of Brazil’s motorcycles and bicycles, and a large number of its electronics. The tax breaks make manufacturing 35 per cent cheaper here than in the rest of the country, according to Ernst & Young, the professional services firm.These benefits include a reduction of up to an 88 per cent on import tax, depending on the product; an exemption from the federal government’s excise duty, which can reach 35 per cent; and reductions of 55-100 per cent in value added tax, again according to the product.“Aside from these tax breaks, there is an extra incentive in terms of land,” says Oldemar Iank, acting superintendent for Suframa, the Manaus free-trade zone. The government runs schemes to provide land to manufacturers at virtually no cost.Manaus recently scored an important victory, when Dilma Rousseff, the country’s president, agreed to extend its tax privileges for another 50 years.“This represents a great success for us,” says Mr Iank. “It gives investors security because it is guaranteed by the Congress.”But even with these guarantees, Manaus needs to remain vigilant. With such poor transport links and situated so far from its markets, it would quickly fade back into the jungle without its tax advantages.The city seems to have lost an important battle in the competition between Brazilian states to win a project by Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, to produce in the country, the iPad for Apple, the US technology group.The $12bn proposal, which the government expects would create 100,000 jobs, is most likely to go to São Paulo state at this stage – although there are still questions over whether it will go ahead at all.Indeed, Amazonas stands to lose the most from the so-called “tax wars” between Brazilian states, where each tries to undercut the other by offering incentives to manufacturers to settle in their jurisdictions. By law, states are not permitted to offer tax breaks without the approval of their peers, but in the past this requirement has been ignored.Yet for now, even without the iPad project, things are looking good for Manaus, which is continuing to attract new factories.One of the most recent newcomers is a sister company of Flextronics, the electronics group, that is planning to make the Xbox games console for 30 per cent less than it would cost to import it.“We are the only region that has this model of development,” is how Marcelo Lima Filho, secretary of planning for Amazonas, explains this success."
63;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2011-10-21T17:12:32Z;US earnings tell story of resilience;S&P on course for double-digit profit growth but that could change;The three months from July to September inclusive may have been a torrid period for the financial markets. But the message from big US companies reporting third-quarter earnings this week has been remarkably upbeat.Although the start of the earnings season has included high-profile misses – notably from Apple, Goldman Sachs and Alcoa – companies in the S&P 500 are on course to record their eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit profit growth.Indeed, this week’s big story has been the resilience of equities in the face of big economic worries, the greatest of which remains the eurozone debt crisis.After a brief flirtation with bear market territory at the start of October, and despite continued disagreement between eurozone leaders on how to resolve the crisis, the S&P 500 has bounced back. It is up more than 9 per cent this month, and on Friday traded at its highest level since early August.The best-performing sectors this month are energy, materials, consumer discretionary and industrials. All boast high earnings growth expectations.Recent turmoil has left US and, up to a point, European markets trading at cheap levels versus the outlook for company profits. This means long-term investors could be tempted to look for bargains if they believe what they are hearing from companies and analysts.“Given the uncertainty over Europe, it is not prudent to jump into the market with both feet, but if you have a three- to five-year time horizon, there are great bargains out there,” says Anthony Conroy, head of trading at BNY ConvergEx.Analysts expect a blended average of actual and forecast earnings for the S&P 500 to rise 14.6 per cent for the quarter from a year ago according to S&P Capital IQ. That figure is up from 12.4 per cent a week ago but below the mid-July estimate of 16.94 per cent.In Europe, investors and analysts have more muted expectations for earnings, which are traditionally reported later than in the US. The deteriorating European economic outlook and financial turbulence of recent weeks has led analysts to pare earnings growth forecasts to just 7 per cent this year, and 12 per cent for 2012.“After seeing earnings growth in the first half of the year, it’s now very likely it will slow in the second half,” says William Davies, head of European equities at Threadneedle.Investors are pricing in a bleaker scenario, particularly for banks and cyclical stocks that are exposed to global growth, such as construction, chemicals and mining.“There are a lot of reasons not to own European banks right now, even if they do look cheap,” Mr Davies says. “There will have to be recapitalisations, but we don’t know how big the potential shareholder dilutions will be.”That contrasts with the US, where during the next 12 months analysts expect S&P earnings of $106.19 per share, according to FactSet. That estimate translates into a 12-month forward price to earnings ratio of 11.5 times, well below the 10-year average of 14.9 times.At its current level of 1,240, the S&P 500 is lagging behind expectations of more than $100 earnings per share for 2012. Based on a historic multiple of 15 times earnings, the S&P should be much higher, at about 1,500, argue the bulls.“When you see stocks trading at 11 or 12 times earnings, they really appeal from a value perspective, but a lot of people have been burnt entering the market,” says Mr Conroy.Some investors expect earnings to falter as the economy struggles for traction. The fallout from the bursting of the mortgage and credit bubble may take years to clean up.What is ominous for US companies is the fact that their margins are highly elevated and over time should revert lower towards their long-term average. The only way margins can keep growing is via a stronger economy or further cost-cutting.Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive at General Electric, said during an earnings conference call that the conglomerate’s margins had hit a low for the year in the third quarter.Indeed, a number of US companies derive earnings from their European operations, and slower growth in the region may hit their bottom line.The obvious candidates for any contagion from the eurozone are US banks, and the latest results from Citigroup, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan disclosed that they were seeing renewed stress in consumer balance sheets, with more homeowners and credit-card borrowers falling behind on their payments.Another threat for internationally exposed members of the S&P is a stronger dollar. The sharp rise in the currency during the third quarter has influenced results, with Alcoa, Harley-Davidson and IBM adversely affected.In contrast, Johnson & Johnson derived a boost from the stronger dollar, and says that if it continues, it expects 12 cents to be added to its full-year earnings per share.Just over a quarter of S&P companies have reported so far. Justin Walters, co-head of research at Bespoke Investment Group, says: “By the end of next week, more than 1,000 companies will have reported, and we’ll have a much better feel for the direction that this earnings season has taken by then.”
64;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2011-10-18T14:31:39Z;US banks rise despite Goldman loss;;Bank stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday even though Goldman Sachs posted its second quarterly loss as a public company and Bank of America only avoided being in the red after accounting adjustments and disposals.The main S&P 500 was up 2 per cent at 1,225.38, its highest close since August 3.But Apple, the highest weighted stock in the index, fell more than 5 per cent in after-hours trading, after the firm reported quarterly earnings of $7.05 a share, on revenue of $28.3bn, both much lower than expected.That knocked S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures significantly, suggesting both indices may open lower on Wednesday.Goldman, the biggest US investment bank by market capitalisation, closed up 5.5 per cent to $102.25 despite posting an 84 cents per share loss as the bank’s investments were hit by falling asset prices.Investors were cheered as the bank revealed $2bn in share buy-backs, significantly more than expectedBut Richard Staite, US bank analyst at Atlantic Equities warned: “I think the management will be reluctant to shrink the balance sheet and return much more capital to investors through buy backs”.Goldman took a $1bn hit on its investment in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and $1.9bn in other mark-to-market losses. Investment banking net revenues fell 33 per cent year-on-year to $781m as underwriting revenues seized up with the initial public offering market stalling over the summer.Bank of America surged 10.1 per cent to $6.64 after posting earnings per share of 56 cents on net profit of $6.2bn, its first profit since the first quarter of 2011.But stripping out $3.6bn from the sale of a stake in China Construction Bank and a $4.5bn boost from an accounting adjustment widely used by banks this earnings season to bolster the value of their own debt, BofA was lossmaking.“It’s a relief just to get through most of the major bank announcements and not hear anything too terrible,” said Randy Warren, principal of Warren Financial Service.Mr Warren initiated a position in BofA in August when the stock sunk to $7 and he was impressed by the bank’s work to boost its capital position.BofA’s tier 1 common equity ratio reached 8.65 per cent, well on course to meet Basel III requirements by 2019.Trust bank State Street jumped 10.7 per cent to $37.49 after posting earnings per share of 96 cents, handily beating the average forecast in a Bloomberg poll of analysts of 88 cents.That gave a boost to its rivals Bank of New York Mellon, up 7.6 per cent to $19.77, and Northern Trust, up 4.4 per cent to $38.78, but analysts warned State Street’s performance might not be mirrored at other trust institutions.“State Street is less banklike than the other two, which means it faces less regulatory risk and is less vulnerable to losses on outstanding loans,” said Jeff Hopson at Stifel Nicolaus.Financials in the S&P 500 were up 5 per cent, significantly outperforming every other sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.6 per cent to 11,577.05 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.6 per cent to 2,657.43, into positive territory for the year.In a frantic last hour of trading the S&P 500 had jumped as high as 1,233 on reports Germany and France have agreed the outlines of a $2trn European bail-out package, but sellers forced the market back down towards 1,220, where all previous rallies this summer have ended.Homebuilders, which had been sold heavily on Monday as bank earnings figures suggested mortgage delinquencies may be on the rise again, rebounded strongly.Lennar was up 9.3 per cent to $15.92, DR Horton jumped 11 per cent to $10.59 and PulteGroup was up 11.2 per cent to $4.46 after a better than expected sentiment report from the National Association of Homebuilders.Pharmaceutical company Hospira plunged 21 per cent to $29.51, after it cut its earnings per share guidance for the year to between $2.95 and $3.05, less than the analyst consensus estimate of $3.91, because of production problems at its largest manufacturing plant.IBM fell 4.1 per cent to $178.90 after the computer giant’s quarterly earnings, out after the close of markets on Monday, showed flat performance in major European markets.Coca-Cola was down 0.4 per cent to $66.74 despite reporting increased profit of $2.22bn, as margins shrank.Motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson fell 7.8 per cent to $34.31. Quarterly results appeared strong with retail sales up 5.4 per cent year-on-year, much better than expected. But margin was hit by the strong dollar and restructuring costs at its main manufacturing plant in York, Pennsylvania.
65;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2011-10-09T03:15:56Z;The careerist: Sharing your extracurricular activities;What should you tell colleagues about what you do outside working hours?;"Talking to colleagues about what you do outside of work can be a way of building rapport and adding to your personal brand. But are there some things you just shouldn’t share?What can it do for my career?
Talking about personal details in the office can be beneficial. Executive coach Ros Taylor says: “I’m a great believer in the idea that you should bring yourself to work. So often people are one dimensional.”Ms Taylor says that she has worked with buttoned-up solicitors who put on leathers at the weekend and ride Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Telling colleagues they do this humanises them at the office. She adds that even if your pastime isn’t for everyone, “talking about it may be seen as standing up and being counted – it makes you look more confident”.And letting your professional mask slip a little is no bad thing. “I tell people, ‘I keep chickens and bees,’” says Jennifer Holloway of personal branding consultancy Spark. “It’s revealing and it gives them something to chat about.”Alex Babic, a director at executive search firm DW Simpson, says: “People at work know that I do stand-up comedy and voice-overs. It is a talking point and something that they remember you for.”
Are there limits to what is acceptable?
“It is a fine line,” says Ms Holloway. “If you imagine a ladder that has the most professional you at the top and the very drunk you at the bottom, you need to decide what rung you want to reveal of yourself.”She says that a further complication is a kind of “social hygiene” factor that you get with pastimes such as hunting, religion and politics.However, she adds that even potentially tricky activities can work in the right context. “I worked with a hunter once and he was worried about saying he did that in a company report. But he went ahead and it turned out that a lot of his customers were farmers, so that was OK.”Ms Taylor agrees. “I’ve coached a CEO who collected death masks – he had one of James Joyce. Even strange pastimes can be quite consistent with who you are.”However, you shouldn’t become a pastime bore, as epitomised by the runner who tells colleagues about every training session. “Don’t inflict your hobbies on other people,” says Ms Taylor.
What if I don’t want to divulge?
“There might be things you keep to yourself,” says Ms Holloway. “But you should never actively lie, because doing so and getting caught will almost certainly be very embarrassing.”For this reason, you may need to exercise caution on sites such as Facebook and Twitter. You should also keep some divide between the work and personal spheres – or there could be practical considerations.Mr Babic says: “I talk about my stand-up afterwards rather than announcing gigs beforehand. If I had a dozen colleagues watching, I could guarantee it would be the night I’d come across as a big angry, unfunny man wrestling with his demons, rather than a comic Lothario.”"
66;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2011-09-06T18:06:33Z;US banks lead Wall Street lower;;US bank stocks fell sharply on Tuesday – following the lead of their European counterparts 24 hours earlier – as renewed fears about eurozone sovereign debt hit investors’ confidence as they returned from a long Labor Day weekend.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 led the market lower, with bank shares down 1.8 per cent as the S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,165.24.The broad index has now more than reversed the late August four-day rally, and is trading only 60 points above its year lows seen early last month.“There is no reason to think this ends anytime soon,” said Dan Greenhouse, chief strategist at BTIG, blaming European politicians for the falls in US equities.Morgan Stanley was the biggest faller among the big banks, off 4 per cent at $15.33. Citigroup fell 2.5 per cent to $27.70. Bank of America, the biggest faller in early trading, pared some losses to close down 3.6 per cent at $6.99.On top of bond market jitters about Italian sovereign debt, US banks had their own bad news to contend with, as federal lawsuits against big banks dominated US headlines over the holiday weekend. The possible settlement of one case concerning foreclosure practices was balanced by a new case announced on Friday over mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.But Nomura analyst Brian Foran held out hope for bank stocks, predicting mortgage refinancing revenue “will be big in the second half of 2011”.In a note to clients Mr Foran argued that as many as 75 per cent of US mortgage holders have an incentive to refinance at current record low interest rates. “Capacity constraints and pricing power,” mean banks are better placed than customers to benefit, as they can charge customers interest rates higher than banks’ own cost of funding.Mr Foran upgraded Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp – up 1.4 per cent at $9.75 – from hold to buy, because of its large mortgage book.Mr Foran also said big mortgage originators, Wells Fargo – down 1.2 per cent to $23.92 – and Bank of America should receive temporary revenue boosts from refinancing.Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, said another refinancing spike, “would be helpful but not a game changer”.Even at the peak of the last refinancing spike in the fourth quarter of last year, mortgage refinancing revenue only accounted for 14 per cent of revenue at Wells Fargo and 11 per cent at Fifth Third.Credit Suisse recommended clients buy regional bank stocks, arguing low interest rates are already priced into their business models because most regional bank lending is to commercial clients at variable rates.On the other hand, national banks are likely to see interest rate margins compress over time, as fixed rate consumer loans mature and are refinanced at lower rates.Analyst Craig Siegenthaler recommended buying Fifth Third, Zions and Synovus Financial.But Zions and Synovus both fell, down 1.2 per cent to $15.99 and 2.2 per cent to $1.31 respectively. Bellwether regional bank, Regions Financial was among the the biggest fallers in the S&P 500, down 5.8 per cent at $3.89.Consumer discretionary stocks fell 0.4 per cent, with Harley Davidson, down 2.4 per cent to $35.15, suffering after a survey of dealers by RBC Capital Markets found sales growth likely slowed in August.Homebuilder PulteGroup fell 4 per cent to $4.21.But consumer staples were also off 0.4 per cent, and utilities were down 0.6 per cent as defensive stocks fared badly too.Netflix shares rose 2.7 per cent to $218.77, after the company announced its Latin American customers will have access to Miramax content.Netflix shares are still down almost 10 per cent for the month after the breakdown, last week, of contract renewal talks with the cable network Starz.International Paper Company, the largest US pulp and paper maker, was the biggest riser in the S&P 500. Its shares rose 8.9 per cent to $27.77 after the company successfully concluded its 3 month battle to acquire shipping-box manufacturer Temple InlandThe $3.7bn bid values Temple-Inland at $32 a share. Temple shares rose 25 per cent to $30.85.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, underwriters of Dunkin’ Brands summer IPO, both initiated coverage of the donut and coffee chain owner. Goldman told clients to sell the stock. Morgan Stanley rated it hold. Analysts at both banks said the potential for earnings growth was already reflected in the share price.Dunkin shares rose 0.1 per cent to $27.02Energy stocks were down 1.1 per cent, but Sunoco was up 5.3 per cent at $38.03, after the chemical manufacturer decided to shut its last two petroleum refineries.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off 0.9 per cent at 11,139.3, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent at 2,473.83.
67;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2011-09-02T21:14:23Z;First Person: Sheeja Mathews;Friends of the Bangalore resident implore her to visit their offices on her motorbike, so they can prove they know her;"I was 12 or 13 when I started riding bikes. I used to take my dad’s old two-wheeler out around the neighbourhood. That was long before I got a licence, but my dad knew that I was a safe rider. All the tom-boyish kids I knew were getting their wheels pretty quickly. It wasn’t until my early twenties that I got serious about riding though. I’d gone into human resources after university, and was working for a multinational investment company in Bangalore. I started riding my husband’s bike, a Yamaha Rajdoot 350, to work.I could have just taken the bus; my office has an official bus that picks up employees from home. But I found that boring: just sitting in a bus, going to and from work at set times. Traffic in Bangalore is terrible and I was often on the road for three hours a day. I preferred to ride, and my husband wasn’t using his bike much anyway. If I hadn’t taken it out, it would have sat in the garage.A few years ago, I heard about these drag races that get organised in Bangalore every six months. I signed up. The races happen on a hill, over a 2km stretch where all the traffic is blocked off. Basically, you climb up with your bike and then race down. There are twists and turns; one wrong move and you’re down. But the speed! Oh my God. It’s absolutely amazing.I raced twice in the ladies’ category and won both times. My husband always teases me. He says, “How many ladies actually participated in those races?” OK, I’ll admit that there were only three competitors. But I beat them all and I’m really proud of that. I never spoke about this in my office, of course. Only my closest friends knew that I would sometimes bunk off work on a weekday to do a race or to practise driving.At the end of last year, a Harley-Davidson showroom opened in Bangalore. It became a landmark, with people crowding around to look at the bikes and take pictures. In February, I pulled my husband aside and said I wanted to order a Harley. If you ask me, Harley-Davidsons are for the most passionate drivers. They’re ridden by rough-and-tumble people. And I’m not a plain Jane. I ordered a standard Iron 883, for about Rs7.8 lakh (£10,350). To be frank, I had my eye on the heavier bikes in the store, but they were way beyond my budget. That was probably for the best, because my model is very sleek and better for riding in the city.As soon as the bike arrived in June, I became a celebrity – I was on the national news in India, in the daily papers and on TV. They told me: you’re the first woman in India to own a Harley! I had no idea. Now, every time I stop at a traffic signal, people surround me. Sometimes they get really close; they want to check the bike’s mileage or ask if it’s hard to handle. Friends want me to visit their offices with the bike, so they can prove to their colleagues that they know me.My son is especially excited. I took a week off work because he wanted me to drop him off and pick him up from school on my bike. His friends didn’t believe him that it’s his Mumma with a Harley. I never expected this to get so much attention. At some point, though, it becomes too much. At every meeting, on every call, people just want to talk about the bike.But soon, there will be fresh news and this will pass over. I think it’s just a matter of time before more women in India start owning Harleys. Already, women here are getting into heavy biking, and I’m starting to see a lot of ladies riding two-wheelers. I just heard about a lady in Hyderabad who has bought a Harley; she’s the second woman in India.Still, women don’t take to racing as much. And I’m really looking forward to racing on my Harley.

Richard Bove at Rochdale Securities released a note arguing the bank’s balance sheet remains strong, helped by new deposit inflows of $18.2bn in the quarter just ended, and as much as $20bn in the past two weeks.Trading in bank credit markets had sparked some of the worry as well. Five-year credit default swaps on BofA rose 9 basis points to 380bp, or $380,000 annually to insure $10m in debt, according to Markit. Earlier it had spiked to 435bp, surpassed its previous high in March 2009 of 390bp, before narrowing later in the day.Goldman Sachs CDS prices also initially rose before narrowing sharply, adding just 7bp to 245bp on the day, well below their peak levels in 2008.Charles Schwab rose 6.1 per cent to close at $11.97 after SEC filings revealed board-member Roger O. Walther had exercised an option to purchase 17,034 shares.There was some good news for banks. The number of banks on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s “Problem List” fell from 888 to 865 in the second quarter, the first decline since 2006. The total assets of “problem” institutions fell from $397bn to $372bn.The broad S&P 500 index rallied strongly, up 3.4 per cent to1,162.35, on continued hopes that Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke will signal further quantitative easing at his Jackson Hole speech on Friday.Sprint Nextel recorded its largest single day gains this year. Shares climbed 10.1 per cent to close at $3.59 on reports it will begin selling Apple’s iPhone 5 in mid-October. At the moment Sprint’s larger rivals, Verizon and AT&T, are the only US networks licensed to sell Apple’s popular handset.Sprint managers had been hinting to analysts for some time that the iPhone 5 would be part of their line up by the end of the year, according to Michael Nelson at Mizuho Securities. “The iPhone’s popularity combined with Sprint’s marketing focus on unlimited customers could allow it to reverse the decline in lucrative postpaid customers,” he said.Energy stocks performed strongest up 4.6 per cent. Solar panel firms outperformed, as the price of polysilicon, the main material used in the manufacture of photovoltaic panels, rose to $51.96 from $51.17, in a sign of rising demand.MEMC Electronic Materials was up 12.7 per cent to 46.83. First Solar gained 7.6 per cent to close at $94.33.The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.0 per cent at 11,176.76, and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 4.29 per cent at 2,446.06.Nvidia Corp, a maker of graphics chips, climbed 11.0 per cent to $13.23, after Wells Fargo raised its recommendation on the company, in anticipation of, “a seasonal lift in PC-related chip demand and beyond that a recovery in the consumer PC end market”.Harley-Davidson Inc shares were up 6.5 per cent at $34.20 after a survey of US motorcycle dealers by Robert W. Baird found the company is on pace for sales growth of 11 per cent in Q3, almost double Baird’s previous growth forecast.Heinz was a rare faller. Its share lost 1.2 per cent to close at $51.44, after the condiment maker reported earnings per share of 70 cents, taking a hit of 8 cents per share from one-off expenditure on productivity improvements.Walgreen was down 0.6 per cent at $34.68 after Barclays Capital lowered its 2012 earnings per share estimate to $2.74 from $3.10. Walgreen is at risk of losing $5 billion in annual revenue over a dispute with Express Scripts over how much the pharmacy benefits manager pays Walgreen to fill prescriptions.Markets did not seem ruffled by worrying economic data. The Richmond Federal Reserve’s index of factory output on the mid-Atlantic eastern seaboard fell to -10 in August from -1 in July. opened.In the US, sales of new single family homes fell by a month on month 0.7 per cent in July to a seasonally adjusted 298,000, which was the worst performance since February. Most analysts had expected a slight uptick in sales. Shares in homebuilder PulteGroup fell 4.0 per cent to $3.61.

It raised its full-year earnings forecast to $13.25 a share, versus the $12.31 that analysts had been anticipating.IBM shares were up 5.7 per cent at $185.21. It led the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which added 200 points, rising 1.6 per cent to 12,587.42.There were hints of caution, as IBM explained that many of the sales of servers were delayed refreshings of existing equipment rather than new sales.But tech traders drove shares of other IT infrastructure groups higher. Broadcom and F5 Networks, which build data storage and networking equipment, led the sector.Broadcom added 6.2 per cent to $34.70, and F5 gained 6.1 per cent to $118.56.Technology groups dominated gains, with the S&P 500 sector higher by 2.7 per cent, its best one-day gain since July 2010.The Nasdaq Composite index enjoyed its best session since October, rising 2.2 per cent to 2,826.52.The broader S&P index – where tech shares make up the largest weighting – was up 1.6 per cent at 1,326.73, its biggest gain since March.The index was boosted by a jump in News Corp, whose shares jumped 5.5 per cent to $15.79. Rupert Murdoch, the company’s chairman and chief executive, was questioned by MPs on a UK parliamentary committee on Tuesday and denied responsibility for alleged phone hacking.Apple recorded earnings of $7.79 a share versus forecasts of $5.87 a share. The shares hit $400 in after-hour trading. Apple’s shares are 10 per cent above their 50-day moving average at $376.85, an all-time high. The shares were up just 0.8 per cent on Tuesday.But strategists at Bespoke Investment Group say that should not prevent big gains if Apple tops estimates of $5.87 in earnings per share for the quarter.“History has shown that the stock has actually done better on report days when it has been overbought than when it has been oversold,” they said.Kevin Pleines, Birinyi Associates analyst, noted that Apple never issues guidance above what Wall Street expects, and so has easily beaten expectations in every quarter since 2004. During trading the day before it reports, Apple has registered gains 71 per cent of the time.The financial sector is lagging, up 1.4 per cent on the session, due to mixed trading among its biggest members.Bank of America reported a one-time writedown of $8.8bn related to settlements of mortgage fraud accusations.But the rest of BofA’s businesses earned 33 cents a share, which topped estimates of 28.7 cents. Improvements were seen in its market share of fixed income trading and growth in consumer loans.Wells Fargo topped estimates by earning 70 cents a share, versus forecasts of 69.4 cents. It set aside fewer dollars for loan loss reserves, leading to a record net income of $3.95bn for the quarter.Wells Fargo shares led the financials, gaining 5.7 per cent to $28.41.BofA’s shares were down 1.5 per cent in trading, to $9.57.Banks that reported strong earnings earlier were stronger. JPMorgan was up 1.4 per cent at $40.39, and Citigroup added 0.7 per cent to $38.02.Goldman Sachs delivered the first disappointing bank earnings of the second-quarter earnings season, thanks to its heavy reliance on trading. The shares fell 0.7 per cent in early trading to $128.49, at one point touching their lowest level since 2009.The Dow was led by IBM and The Coca-Cola Company, which reported earnings per share that topped forecasts by 1 cent, thanks to strong international demand. Its shares rose 3.4 per cent to $69.40.The top advancer in the S&P 500 was Harley-Davidson, the motorbike manufacturer, which jumped 8.9 per cent to $45.11.It reported the first year-over-year quarterly boost in US sales since 2006. That was its highest price since 2007.Avery Dennison was the worst performer in the index, falling 13.7 per cent to $32.65 after the designer of business equipment warned that its third-quarter earnings would fall short of expectations.
70;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2011-07-17T16:17:18Z;Luxury motorbike sales accelerate in India;;Every day India’s cities hum with the sound of hundreds of motorcycles precariously weaving their way through traffic. For most riders the two-wheeler is the cheaper and more flexible alternative to a car but for a growing band of more affluent Indians owning a customised superbike has become the ultimate symbol of the country’s new-found wealth.Sales of premium bikes made by the likes of Italy’s Ducati, Japan’s Suzuki and Harley-Davidson of the US have grown steadily over the past few years after New Delhi in 2007 agreed to permit the import of bikes with a more than 800cc engine as long as they met certain emissions standards.Foreign brands say they are attracted by India’s rising income levels, growing demand for luxury goods and evidence of an organic motorcycle culture.Germany’s BMW recently started selling superbikes through two of its dealerships. And last month Triumph, the iconic British motorcycle manufacturer that collapsed in the 1980s and was later resuscitated by a property tycoon, said it would move into India. The group has tapped Ashish Joshi – the former European head of Royal Enfield, the British motorcycle marque that was revived by India’s Eicher Motors – to lead its Indian charge.Fans of the Rocket III and Daytona 675 have been urging Triumph to enter the Indian market for some time but the group says its focus has been on increasing sales at home and in developed markets such as the US and Italy.Triumph, which produces just 50,000 bikes a year, last year launched in Russia and says moving into India now is about “getting a toehold” in a market with lots of potential.Analysts say that while India’s broader bike market has seen double-digit growth over the past few years, the premium segment is still just a niche market.Foreign companies are required to pay hefty import taxes that in effect double the cost of the bikes, although some manufacturers have sought to reduce costs by assembling bikes in India. And with prices starting from $9,000-$20,000, they say performance bikes are still out of the reach of many middle-class professionals.“We have entered the Indian market at a time when leisure riding is at a nascent stage and feel we can shape that,” says Anoop Prakash, managing director for Harley-Davidson India. “I’m quite bullish. In 2010 the market for premium bikes stood at 1,000 units a year. My view is that the market could see a 10-fold increase over the next five to seven years in India.”Ducati, meanwhile, says it expects to double the number of bikes sold in India to 200 in the next 12 months.The units sold may be low but auto experts calculate that the high profit margins on each bike mean premium manufacturers are making money out of India. They often reap extra sales from merchandising or from customers who just want to soak up the super bike experience in cafés connected to the showrooms or at sponsored rock concerts.But analysts say foreign brands cannot expect a smooth ride. Mr Prakash says India’s regulatory environment is not always easy to predict. On the one hand the government was very “encouraging” about Harley’s initial investment. But he says the industry was surprised when the government decided to raise the duty on completed knocked down (CKD) kits for car and bike manufacturers, based on a revision of the definition of CKD in India, from 10 per cent to 60 per cent in the April Union Budget. The government settled on a 30 per cent rise but Mr Prakash says the move “caught everyone off guard”.Harley absorbed the rise in duty and remains committed to the market. But Mr Prakash says such moves “may give some of our peers pause for thought”.
71;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2011-05-23T17:34:36Z;Zippo feels heat as US sales decline;;"Zippo, the US lighter manufacturer popularised by US soldiers during the second world war, is increasingly looking to international markets and alternative products as efforts to curb smoking have damped its domestic sales.Greg Booth, chief executive of the Pennsylvania-based company, says Zippo will begin selling grills, lanterns, patio heaters and Tiki torches next year as it continues to look for new ways to diversify its business. Meanwhile, China, its biggest international market and home to more than 300m smokers, represents its greatest hope as tobacco use declines in the US.“We make products that generate flames, and there are a lot of reasons why people buy lighters other than smoking,” Mr Booth told the Financial Times.Zippo has been trying to separate its fortunes from cigarettes for many years as bans across the US hampered demand for expensive lighters. Those troubles were compounded by restrictions imposed on travelling with lighters and knives, which Zippo also makes, after the US terrorist attacks on September 11 2001.At its peak in 1996, “windproof” lighters accounted for more than 90 per cent of Zippo’s sales when it sold a record 17.3m. Those figures have fallen precipitously, and this year the company expects to sell 11.5m, with lighters accounting for just 54 per cent of its $200m annual revenue.Mr Booth estimates that tobacco use is falling by about 2 per cent per year in the US and that there is a correlation between sales of that and Zippo lighters. The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the US has just 46m smokers.Cologne, watches and apparel now represent a significant part of Zippo’s portfolio as it seeks to translate the success of its lighters into other products.Lee St James, who was a creative director for Ketchum Advertising and worked on Zippo’s rebranding efforts in the 1990s, says that some of its ventures have failed to succeed because they have strayed too far from its roots. He compares the company to Harley Davidson, another iconic US brand, which overextended its name
to other products before refocusing on the motor-cycle.“Marketing the Zippo fragrance was a bit of a stretch,” Mr St James says, noting that many consumers feared it would smell like lighter fluid. “They need to look at things that are relevant to their history. It’s an amazing piece of Americana.”Founded in 1932 and family owned, Zippo became standard equipment for cigarette-smoking soldiers and the rectangular metal lighter with the flip-top lid has been immortalised in countless films. Rare collectable Zippos sell for thousands of US dollars while the basic model costs about $20.According to Mr Booth, the strength of the Zippo brand in the US has made it more challenging for the company to launch new products domestically because the name is so deeply associated with lighters.Overseas purchases now represent 60 per cent of Zippo’s total sales and in China and India the growth has been especially rapid. Zippo lighter sales have advanced by 30 per cent year-on-year for the past 10 years in China, and last year they rose by 69 per cent in India.The importance of the Chinese market, which accounts for nearly a quarter of Zippo’s international lighter sales, is ironic for a manufacturer that five years ago filed trade complaints against Chinese companies for selling counterfeit Zippo lighters.“Zippo had voracious competition from the Chinese that were flooding the market with cheap knock-offs,” says Ann Dugan, director of the University of Pittsburgh's Institute
for Entrepreneurial Excellence.“But they educated Chinese consumers about the special qualities of the brand and at a certain level of affordability, they prefer the real thing too.”"
72;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2011-04-19T22:11:01Z;Polaris to buy oldest US motorcycle maker;;Polaris Industries, a US-based maker of all-terrain and other specialised vehicles, aims to challenge Harley Davidson’s dominance of the heavy cruiser motorcycle market by buying Indian Motorcycle, the US’s oldest bike maker.Polaris plans to combine Indian with its own 13-year-old Victory bike brand to achieve improved economies of scale. “Harley will finally have a run for their money if Polaris plays their cards right”, said Stephen Julius, owner of Stellican, a London-based private equity firm that specialises in the takeover and the revival of distressed heritage brands and has owned Indian for seven years.Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Indian has yet to turn a profit since it restarted production in late 2008. It has built about 1,000 bikes during that period, a small fraction of Harley’s annual output of about 250,000 units.Motorcycles and other on-road vehicles made up 4 per cent of Polaris’s 2010 revenues, totalling $1.99bn.Harley, which has sought to rejuvenate itself over the past two years, reported first-quarter net income of $119.3m, or 51 cents a share, on Tuesday, almost double the $68.7m, or 29 cents, earned a year earlier. The improvement was due mainly to a sharply improved performance by its financial services arm, as well as a 3.5 per cent rise in bike sales.Europe led the sales growth but US retail sales fell slightly. Citing “challenging macroeconomic conditions” for the US decline, Keith Wandell, chief executive, expressed caution on prospects for the rest of the year and said the company remained focused on becoming “leaner, more agile and more effective”.Indian was founded in 1901, two years before Harley, and was the US’s biggest motorcycle maker for a time before the first world war. However, the company subsequently fell on hard times, filing twice for bankruptcy.Stellican bought the trademarks in 2004, restarting production at a factory in North Carolina. Indian now has 30 dealers, including one each in France, Switzerland, Japan and South Korea.“We’ve done the heavy lifting” Mr Julius said. “Polaris will have the scale in manufacturing, distribution and purchasing to turbocharge the development of the company.”Indian’s Chief model, whose hallmark is the Red Indian logo on its fuel tank, pioneered the heavy cruiser market now dominated by Harley. Typically priced at $25,000-$35,000, these bikes have become increasingly popular among rich urbanites, such as lawyers and bankers.Polaris and Indian, like Harley, have sought to boost revenues with parts, accessories, clothing and other branded merchandise.
73;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2010-12-14T23:10:16Z;A head for lotions and potions;;There is a paradox at the heart of the success of John Paul DeJoria, co-founder of John Paul Mitchell Systems. Mr DeJoria has used his smooth public persona to build a haircare products company with sales estimated by US business magazine Forbes at $900m a year. But he remains cautious, not to say secretive, when discussing other parts of a business empire that has given him a personal fortune estimated by Forbes to be $4.2bn.Meeting the Californian entrepreneur for a chat is a little like running into Colonel Sanders. Few founders are as instantly recognisable. His grey ponytail and neatly clipped beard have appeared in millions of posters and other promotional media for the company since he set it up in 1980 with Paul Mitchell, a Hawaii-based hairdresser, who died in 1989.Now 66, Mr DeJoria is still energetically fronting up the brand, including at a recent “European Gathering” for 1,500 hairdressers in Birmingham. Sitting in his plush hotel suite, the tall, fit-looking man in a charcoal long-sleeved T-shirt and blue jeans ex­plains that the UK event mirrors a US shindig that is attended by a maximum of 3,000 people “because that’s about all the hands I can shake”. The fun typically includes pep talks, demonstrations by well-known hairdressers and sometimes the arrival of Mr DeJoria – thanks to some stage trickery – astride a flying Harley-Davidson motorcycle.His back story is that he grew up in poverty in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles, belonged to a street gang in his teens and was so short of funds when setting up John Paul Mitchell Systems that he slept in his car. Mr DeJoria is at pains, however, to qualify the implied wretchedness. “We didn’t know that we were kind of poor, because everyone around us was too,” he says. “We were happy kids, you know.” As for the gang, “street gangs in those days didn’t kill anybody”. The baseball bats and flick knives were for show, apparently.Moreover, Mr DeJoria’s extemporised motor home was a Rolls-Royce: “It was 20 years old and leaked a little, but it was still a cool car.” He had joined the navy after school and then worked at “everything you can imagine”, before joining Redken, the haircare products business, in 1971.By 1980 he had a track record as “a promoter and businessman”. He wound up sleeping in his Rolls-Royce partly because separating from his first wife had cleaned him out, and partly bec­ause the investor backing his start-up with his old friend Paul Mitchell got cold feet at the last moment.The business partners had only $700 between them. This disappeared into the pocket of the graphic designer of their packaging artwork. The other suppliers for their new haircare range had mercifully agreed to be paid in 30 days. This gave them a window in which to drum up orders from salons and distributors, making just enough sales to pay for stock.“It was hand to mouth,” Mr DeJoria recalls. “We had no money and no loans. It was two years before we could pay our bills on time and have $2,000 left over in the bank. When that happened, we knew we had it made.”The keystone of the privately owned business’s strategy then and now is to sell its products only to hair salons. Some of the goods are used by hairdressers on site. Some are sold on to salon customers. Hairdressers often have close relationships with regular female clients and that makes them persuasive salespeople.According to Mr DeJoria, the business has flourished by giving hairdressers high-quality products that meet their needs. For example, one of its first three products was a conditioner that did not need rinsing out and functioned as a cutting lotion. “It was a very niche product,” he says, “But it saved time and money for the hairdresser.” The business, in which Mr DeJoria has a majority stake, now has more than 100 products in its range and sells in more than 80 countries. He fights a constant battle against grey market sales – John Paul Mitchell Systems products being sold through supermarkets.Mr DeJoria is also at odds with Forbes, which he says has spurned his entreaties to remove him from its list of billionaires. Researchers added him in recognition of the growing scale of Patrón Spirits. This is an premium tequila business that Mr DeJoria, who now lives in Austin, Texas, set up with his friend Martin Crowley in 1989. The spirit, made not just from the agave plant, but from the “highlander Weber blue agave”, retails for about $40 per hand-blown bottle. It is smoother than some other tequilas and its luxury positioning has made it popular with hip-hop musicians such as 50 Cent.Swiss-registered Patrón makes the tequila in Atotonilco, Mexico. “We built a 17th-centurychateau for our staff to work in,” says Mr DeJoria. “Everyone there gets free lunch.” The company only publishes its sales as defined by nine-litre cases of tequila, which topped 1.74m in 2009.But this was apparently enough to give Forbes a handle on the value of the company. “They don’t know about all the other things that I do, because I won’t tell them,” says Mr DeJoria.Nor, sadly, will he tell the Financial Times. His beautiful manners preclude him from saying, “Mind your own business, buddy.” But attempts to extract the names of the oil, gas and renewable energy companies in which he has stakes are fruitless. They only lead, via the tenuous connection of environmentalism, to an anecdote concerning the donations he gave bell-ringing street corner Santa Clauses when he was a kid. He is a committed philanthropist, supporting a range of humanitarian and environmental charities.“I’d rather be low key in my life,” Mr DeJoria says. He adds that “Donald Trump and I are the opposite of each other”.You cannot reach Mr DeJoria by e-mail because he does not read e-mail. In working life he favours “fewer moving parts”, as he puts it. For example, there is no middle management in his companies because “people are capable of supervising themselves and doing a darn good job”.“Wherever I am is the headquarters for John Paul Mitchell Systems,” he concludes. But this is less a grandiloquent declaration than an insistence that businesses need not be complicated to succeed. Or involve too much grandstanding by the proprietor. Give or take the odd dramatic entrance astride a flying motorcycle.
74;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2010-12-10T22:52:29Z;Sale of the week: Malcolm Forbes toy collection;;"Sale: The Malcolm Forbes toy collectionLocation: Sotheby’s, 1334 York Avenue, New York, tel: +1 212 606 7000Date: Friday (December 17) at 2pm. On view Saturday 10am-5pm; Sunday 1pm-5pm; Monday-Thursday 10am-5pm. Day of sale 10am-1pm. Catalogue at www.sothebys.comNeed to know: The late publishing tycoon Malcolm Forbes collected everything from hot air balloons to historical documents and from Fabergé eggs to Harley-Davidson motorcycles, of which he owned 68. But toys were perhaps his greatest passion. For decades he trawled attics, antiques shops and salerooms in pursuit of battalions of lead soldiers, squadrons of model aircraft and, in particular, flotillas of miniature ships. But, unlike many fanatics, he did not always demand that his purchases should be in pristine condition – while he would gladly snap up old toys that were boxed and in mint condition, he was just as happy to buy those that bore evidence of vigorous play. As the collection grew, Forbes decided to display the miniature soldiers, boats and motorcycles on the first floor of the Forbes building on New York’s Fifth Avenue, enlisting the services of his son, Robert, as curator. This is the second sale of toys from the collection since Malcolm’s death in 1990.Highlights: Comprising 237 lots, the sale is tipped to raise up to $5m; the star of the show is a 47in gunboat that is estimated at $200,000-$300,000. Not exactly your average bath toy, this replica of a 19th-century battleship is made from cast iron and has a fully operational, gas-powered engine. There is also a 38in recreation of the Lusitania, the luxury liner that sank after being torpedoed by a U-boat in 1915, which Forbes bought at Sotheby’s in 1983 for $28,600 – it’s now worth almost 10 times as much.Among thousands of lead soldiers are sets containing hundreds of infantrymen and cavalry, both on foot and on horseback. One display depicts a battle between Italian and Ethiopian troops ($10,000-$15,000) while another incorporates a model castle populated by more than 24 complete sets of soldiers made by toy firm Britain’s ($12,000-$18,000). Forbes’s love of motorcycles extended to toy versions and the sale features more than 100, including some rare clockwork examples. One of the very first Monopoly sets is also up for grabs. Handmade by the game’s inventor, Charles B Darrow, it features a round board and is estimated at $60,000-$80,000. The ultimate Christmas present, surely?"
75;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2010-12-03T19:16:02Z;Fed up;It is easy to be outraged now, but the alternative was worse;WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, eat your heart out. Interpol will not be chasing Bernie Sanders, the senator who inserted a small clause in the 383,000 word Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill compelling the Federal Reserve to release this week’s other trove of information. Nevertheless, outrage in some quarters is as great as that from despots portrayed unflatteringly in the pilfered cables.Anger at the Fed is misplaced. As memories of the financial panic fade, it is easy to decry the huge sums dispensed and the variety of recipients. But the size and scope of the facilities only serve to underscore just how bad things really were. Had Ben Bernanke baulked, we would be pillorying him today for the graver error of being too conservative.Another point of criticism is the prodigious sums lent to foreign institutions, provoking Mr Sanders to pledge an investigation. This betrays a misunderstanding of the interconnectedness that led to the crisis. Just as Lehman’s bankruptcy sparked a global liquidity freeze, the further collapse of an even larger institution such as Barclays would have had huge ramifications in the US and might have pushed the system over the edge.Only the Fed has the ability to create the world’s reserve currency out of thin air. This privilege has benefited Americans greatly over the years, but it also comes with great responsibility. When banks had become too big, the Fed’s duty was to save them.Finally, the fact that money flowed to non-banks such as Harley- Davidson, and to hedge funds, is also being criticised. But the disintermediation of the financial sector in recent decades and the reliance on non-bank lending meant that far more was at stake than motorcycles and masters of the universe. Any of them could have toppled the global system. Hillary Clinton has reason to be red-faced this week. Ben Bernanke does not.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
76;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2010-11-08T20:41:25Z;Rok fall shows perils of style over substance;;Rok’s Garvis Snook has fallen victim to the iron law of financial communications: if you’re pictured on the way up in your leathers astride a Harley-Davidson, or scaling a climbing wall with your finance director, your fall will be fast and your landing hard.Rok’s descent into administration was sudden. As of last week, it looked as though the chief executive might merely have to issue another embarrassing profit warning. But it was also grimly inevitable.Like Mark Tincknell, ex-chief executive of Connaught – which also works in social housing maintenance, also called in the administrators, and, spookily, is also headquartered in Exeter – Rok’s Mr Snook showed a shocking overconfidence, as budgetary pressure on key customers mounted and concerns about financial and operational controls widened earlier this year. Humility, in the form of the reversal in September of Rok’s earlier decision to suspend Mr Snook’s erstwhile climbing partner, Ashley Martin, came too late.Yes, the repair and maintenance specialist royally botched its explanation of its troubles. But that was not the main reason for Rok’s fall. Unwanted publicity – plus news of Connaught’s separate problems – may have unsettled creditors, but this wasn’t what undermined the group, either. The mundane reality for Mr Snook, who has gone from “Teflon Garvis” to “Tinfoil Garvis” in the space of a few days, is that it was a simple slump in demand for some of Rok’s core services that knocked the scaffolding away from his carefully constructed image.Farewell to family GuyThe plight of Gartmore, as recounted by its executives, sounds a bit like A Series of Unfortunate Events, the run of children’s novels in which a horrid tragedy interrupts the central characters’ blissful existence and condemns them to a lifetime of ghastliness.Yet that implies that unforeseen accidents of fate have driven this tale of woe for investors. In fact, the Guy-meets-Gartmore, Gartmore-falls-for-Guy, Guy-falls-out-of-love-with-Gartmore, Guy-lives-happily-ever-after plot was written when the funds group was floated less than a year ago in an effort to reduce debt accumulated in a prior leveraged buy-out.Once Roger Guy’s co-star Guillaume Rambourg left in the summer, it was surely odds-on that Mr Guy himself would quit. Internally, the belief that Mr Guy’s reputation was somehow bound up with his continued presence at Gartmore looked flimsy. A man who had already made a fortune that more than offset any loss he might inflict on his stake in the group by leaving was unlikely to fret about the impact on his image – particularly if he decided to put his family first. A series of fortunate events might have prevented his departure, continued underperformance of his funds (down 1.9 per cent and 3.2 per cent in the year to September 30) made the decision to leave relatively easy.Oddly, it might have been possible for Gartmore to craft a happier ending out of Mr Guy’s decision – rebalanced team, diversified approach etc – had other senior personnel not quit at the same time. Jeff Meyer, Gartmore’s hapless chief executive (now forced to plug another gap as chief investment officer), looks isolated, while shareholders can only rue their costly complicity in one truly unfortunate event: the initial public offering itself.That’s all, folks!It’s hardly controversial to say that building two new aircraft carriers without aircraft to fly from them risks making Britain “a laughing stock”. But saying so when you’re deputy chairman of one of the builders is decidedly iffy. Lord Hesketh – who told Monday’s Daily Telegraph the programme was a “Looney Tunes” operation “about to turn into a classic British disaster” – duly removed the pistol from his top drawer and did the honourable thing by resigning from the board of Babcock International.That his comments were published on the eve of Babcock’s results and also blamed BAE Systems for the cost of the programme simply compounded the gaffe. BAE’s former chief executive Mike Turner is Babcock’s chairman.As a former Tory minister and a Babcock director since 1993, Lord H should have recognised that, whatever his private opinion, the concept of collective responsibility applies even more strongly to the boardroom than to government. Still, he did at least go out fighting. Having long ago exceeded nine years on the Babcock board, the deputy chairman could not be counted as an independent non-executive under governance guidelines. The manner of his parting suggests he was rather more independent than most people gave him credit for.andrew.hill@ft.com
77;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2010-10-24T19:49:10Z;US motorcycle sector extends decline;;US motorcycle sales shrank by 14.1 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, extending the unremitting decline to 15 consecutive quarters.Sales are now less than half the level at the peak of the market in 2006, according to the California-based Motorcycle Industry Council. Highway bike sales totalled 383,000 last year, down from 660,000 in 2008 and 724,000 in 2007.Keith Wandell, Harley-Davidson’s chief executive, told analysts last week that “the economy has yet to turn around in a convincing way and many consumers remain on the sidelines”.Harley forecast that its shipments would be 5 to 7 per cent lower this year than 2009. Besides the 107-year-old Milwaukee-based company, the main players in the US market are Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Yamaha and, to a lesser extent, BMW.One factor contributing to the malaise is that in the US bikes are ridden mainly for sport and recreation, putting the two-wheelers low on most households’ shopping lists. Far more Asians and Europeans use motorbikes for commuting and running errands, making them an essential item even in tough economic times.Some Japanese bike makers did not produce 2010 models. Excess inventory and heavy discounting contributed to a plunge in used-bike prices, further denting demand for new bikes. Many prospective buyers have also struggled to obtain financing.Mr Wandell said that one of Harley’s priorities was “to aggressively manage supply in line with demand”.Harley has closed about 40 dealerships so far this year and is seeking a further contraction in its retail network, especially in urban areas.It has shipped almost 50,000 fewer bikes in recent years than its dealers have sold in a drive to bring down inventories and halt the slide in used-bike prices. Craig Kennison, analyst at RW Baird, estimates that Harley’s US dealers have more than halved their average inventory over the past three years.Besides an economic recovery, the industry is pinning its hopes on an improving image, and rising ownership among women and young men.The industry council says it is buoyed by a growing willingness among mainstream businesses, such as financial institutions, to feature bikes in advertisements, helping to dispel their “bad boy” image. The council estimates that women now make up 12 per cent of US bike owners.Another glimmer of hope is that while bike sales continue to decline, demand for motorcycle tyres was 7.7 per cent higher in the first nine months of this year than in the period January to September 2009. This could mean that Americans are finding new uses for their bikes and that replacement demand is building.Mr Kennison predicts that sales will start to improve next summer.
78;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2010-07-20T21:31:53Z;Harley-Davidson races ahead;Motorcycle maker sees net income climb to $71.2m;Harley-Davidson shares roared ahead by 13 per cent on Tuesday morning after the Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker reported unexpectedly strong acceleration in second-quarter earnings.Net income climbed to $71.2m, or 30 cents a share, from $19.8m, or 8 cents, a year earlier. The advance was mostly due to a rebound at Harley’s financial services arm.Retail motorcycle sales were 5.5 per cent lower than a year earlier, including an 8.4 per cent dip in the US.Keith Wandell, chief executive, cautioned that demand for new motorcycles was likely to remain challenging for the rest of this year, “and we will manage the business based on that expectation”.
79;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2010-04-20T21:04:07Z;Wall St boosted by healthy bank earnings;;"US stock prices rallied for the second session on Tuesday, helped by gains in the highly weighted financials sector and some strong earnings announcements that boosted the bulls.“Today, it’s a welcome back, risk-recovery trade day around the globe supported by positive earnings surprises from global brand names in diverse sectors in Europe and the US – as well as an improvement in German investor sentiment for the first time in seven months,” said John Stoltzfus, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities.He added: “This week belongs to earnings season with the economic data points back-end loaded for Friday and giving full focus on earnings as 135 companies in the S&P 500 report.”After the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent at 1,207.17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 11,117.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent higher at 2,500.31.Goldman Sachs, in the spotlight after regulators filed fraud charges against the bank on Friday, fell 2.1 per cent to $159.98 in spite of reporting significantly better-than-expected quarterly results, boosted by record fixed-income trading.Net profit increased 91 per cent to $3.46bn, or $5.59 per share, in the quarter, from $1.81bn, or $3.39 per share, a year earlier. The average analyst estimate was $4.14 per share.AIG, the troubled insurer that lost $2bn insuring collateralised debt obligations, including $6bn worth of Goldman’s, is considering pursuing Goldman to recoup some of those losses.The rest of the financials sector was higher as investors appeared to shrug off worries that the action against the bank would impact the wider sector.JPMorgan rose 1.1 per to $45.88 and Bank of America climbed 1.2 per cent to $18.61.Citigroup rose 1.8 per cent to $4.97 as the bank’s target price was raised at UBS to $5 from $3.75.IBM, the world’s largest technology services provider, lost 1.9 per cent to $129.69 in spite of the company raising its full-year earnings guidance and reporting better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, boosted by an 18 per cent rise in consulting-
services signings.First-quarter profit was $1.97 per share from $1.70 per share a year earlier, compared with average analyst expectations of $1.93 per share.Procter & Gamble, the consumer products company, shed 0.1 per cent to $63.19 after it said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 9.5 per cent to 48.18 cents per share.Delta Air Lines dropped 0.2 per cent to $13.16 after the airline reported mixed first-quarter results with lower-than-expected revenues but a drop in losses from previous quarters.The largest carrier by passenger numbers lost $256m, or $0.31 per share, in the quarter to March, compared with a $794m, or $0.96, loss in the same period the previous year.Revenues climbed 2.5 per cent to $6.85bn, helped by rising fares, more bag-checking and fuller planes, but fell short of analyst forecasts of $7bn.Coca-Cola lost 1.5 per cent to $54.47 as the soft drinks company reported quarterly results that missed average analyst estimates, hurt by a decline in North American sales volumes. Revenues in the first quarter rose 5 per cent to $7.53bn, but fell short of the analysts’ average estimate of $7.72bn.Health insurer UnitedHealth Group lost 0.8 per cent to $30.98 even after the company posted first-quarter earnings that rose 21 per cent on the same period a year ago, beating analyst estimates. The company said rising Medicare enrolment offset losses in private-sector plans.Regional lenders were also in focus. US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon both beat earnings expectations. US Bancorp was up 2.2 per cent to $28.21, while BNY Mellon, was up slightly to $32.15.PNC Financial, which sold a unit earlier this year to BNY, was up 2.2 per cent to $64.92.But regional depository banks were some of the biggest fallers of the session after lacklustre earnings reports from two companies. State Street fell 4.2 per cent to $45.28 after it said earnings in the first quarter were in line with expectations but revenues disappointed.Smaller rival Northern Trust lost 5.1 per cent to $55.37. Earnings per share were 64 cents, compared to average analyst estimates of 71 cents per share.Motorbike maker Harley-Davidson was one of the top risers in the S&P 500 index as the company jumped 7.3 per cent to $35.17 after posting better-than-expected first-quarter results."
80;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2010-04-20T20:35:10Z;Earnings trump Goldman and Greek worries;Investors dismiss worry that bank probe could stall rally;21:30 BST: Risky assets saw firm demand on Tuesday as investors appeared reluctant to let the “Goldman wobble” become the catalyst that stalls the multi-month rally.The FTSE All-World equity index rose 0.8 per cent, and commodities saw buying, after traders absorbed another batch of generally solid corporate earnings.But markets also got a reminder of the possible monetary headwinds, after the Indian central bank raised its repo rate 25 basis points to 5.25 per cent and warned of inflationary pressures.Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar surged– again reaching parity with the US dollar – after the Bank of Canada indicated it might raise interest rates in June. Short-term US Treasuries sold off, and the yen plunged as investors embraced risk and fled lower-yielding markets.The situation for Greece also appears to be intensifying, judging by the fresh spike in bond yields. Spreads on Greek sovereign debt and default insurance pressed further into record territory.Earnings results continued to be generally strong, though the impact on equities was uneven. The problem is that with shares having had such a good run of late, these bottom lines are providing less bang for the stock-market buck – witness the reaction to Tesco’s figures in the UK and Coca-Cola’s and IBM’s in the US. Shares of all three were lower on the day.The key driver of sentiment appears to be financial results, with Goldman Sachs reporting a near-doubling of its earnings and US lenders also beating expectations, which added to a string of strong performances from Citigroup, JPMorganChase, and Bank of America.“Upside surprise so far is mainly driven by big banks,” said Thomas Doerflinger, US equity strategist at UBS. “This is bullish as financials are the biggest expected contributor to profit growth in 2010 and have relatively high uncertainty.”But the blow-out numbers also ensure the saga surrounding the banking sector is likely to stay on the front page – surely a drag for the market. Already, Goldman’s situation is slowing the return of the securitisation market, which is critical to making more credit available to businesses and consumers.Indeed, news on Tuesday that the UK’s Financial Services Authority was to launch a formal investigation into Goldman Sachs only reiterated how Wall Street’s dismissive second-day response to the regulatory attack on the banking sector seems dangerously haughty.● Global bourses displayed a generally more positive mood following Wall Street’s late rally on Monday. And this continued as New York opened with a further gain of 0.7 per cent gains as earnings from the likes of financials and consumer cyclicals such as Citigroup and Harley Davidson lent support.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 leapt 1.4 per cent as some of the restrictions on flying were lifted. In London, the FTSE 100 rose 1 per cent, with banks rebounding. The FTSE Global Banks index rose 1.1 per cent.The FTSE Asia-Pacific index climbed 0.5 per cent, though the region’s performance was far from homogeneous. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo gave up early gains to finish down 0.1 per cent, while Sydney edged 0.2 per cent higher.Shanghai could not rebound from its 4.8 per cent plunge of the previous session, and it finished fractionally lower as the clampdown by Beijing on property speculation continued to resonate. Hong Kong’s rise followed the global tone as it gained 1 per cent.● Greek bond yields hit their highest since 1999 as Athens auctioned €1.5bn of three-month bills. The yield on the 10-year benchmark note surged 45bp to 7.93 per cent – the highest mark in over a decade – with some investors increasingly concerned that a form of debt default is becoming inevitable.The yield on Portugal’s 10-year paper rose 2bp to 4.65 per cent. This is a fresh seven-week high and suggests traders are worried that other so-called peripheral eurozone economies will have trouble coping with debt levels.● Such concerns provided little incentive to hold euros, and the single currency fell 0.4 per cent versus the dollar to $1.3437 despite a stronger-than-forecast reading of German investor sentiment for April.A jump in UK inflation saw sterling advance 0.4 per cent versus the euro to 87.59p.The dollar pulled back from early weakness, rising less than 0.1 per cent on a trade-weighted basis to 81.03 thanks to a 0.8 per cent gain, to Y93.17, on the highly-weighted yen. The greenback dropped 1.5 per cent against the Canadian loonie, to C$0.9995 – the second trading session this year it has reached parity.● Highly-rated sovereign bonds saw fluctuating fortunes. Two-year US Treasury notes shot back up above 1 per cent for the first time since last week, rising 3 basis points. Traders were crediting Canada’s impending rate decision, which would reduce demand for lower-yielding short-term US debt.The yield on US 10-year notes was flat at 3.80 per cent, while those of equivalent German Bunds fell 1bp to 3.09 per cent. UK 10-year gilt yields jumped 4bp to 4.02 per cent after the inflation figures.● Gold gained despite the steady dollar, adding 0.2 per cent to $1,138 an ounce.Industrial commodities picked up steam following little action in Asia. Copper climbed 0.5 per cent to $3.53 a pound in New York trading, and oil recovered ground after a 4 per cent two-day sell-off. Benchmark US crude rose 1 per cent to $83.94.Additional reporting by Telis Demos in New York
81;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Victory’s Vision is excess on wheels;;"“This is a Marmite bike,” says Victory dealer Mark Spies. “People either really love it or they really hate it.”But this is no breakfast spread made of brewery waste products. The leftovers that constitute this motorcycle are the sprawling dreams of automotive excess, from the days before vehicles became embarrassed about their very existence.With looks that are a cross between a 1950s Cadillac, Judge Dredd’s bike and a high-intensity sound-and-light show, this is certainly a hard bike to ignore – not least because it is huge.Weaving through traffic on it is like lane splitting in a large car – and scarcely any stealthier. Not only is the Vision big, but it also has more lights than Blackpool and Coney Island combined. Better colours, too.What is more surprising is that Victory Motorcycles, the Minnesota-based manufacturer of the Vision, is a relative newcomer to bike making. An offshoot of Polaris, a long-established manufacturer of snowmobiles and small all-terrain vehicles, Victory sold its first motorcycle in 1998. The plan was to out-Harley the top-selling market leader, Harley-Davidson, with a range of bigger, more extrovert machines – but very much in the company’s mould of long, large bikes with large-capacity V-twin engines.This is not just slavish copying, though. As the Japanese manufacturers found, the expectation of the target market in the US is that bikes have two wheels, a lot of chrome, a certain heft and a big V-twin motor – just as car drivers expect their next purchase to have four wheels.The target market is mainly buyers who can count this machine as an automotive toy to take out only when they feel like it; perhaps on a small number of big touring trips a year. So, while it is a lifestyle accessory, it also has to be able to cover distances. Which means it must have some weather-deflecting ability. And if the optional heated handlebar grips and seats are fitted, they must work well enough beyond the first chill.But none of this diminishes the primary function of the Vision: to soak up attention. From the woman in a Vauxhall car who professed undying love – for the motorcycle, at least – to the chap on an ageing bike who followed me for miles, the Vision tends to vacuum up attention more efficiently than any Italian supercar.It is a motorcycle whose designers were unable to lift their pencils after sketching already long, sweeping lines. The result is a bike that both shows off and disguises its bulk.In city traffic, it is almost a liability. People walk into each other on the pavement to look at it, but it is not going anywhere faster than the cars. The road obstacles that have sprouted in London make it hard to thread through traffic on anything wider than a bicycle. The Victory feels almost four times as wide, and about a dozen times less manoeuvrable. Sitting squarely behind the car in front is the only option.But the built-in sound system helped keep me entertained, even though it subjected everyone nearby to my taste in music.My partner, when installed on the back seat, commented: “This is like a mobile dining room.” Given that we keep a couple of our motorcycles in the dining room, this was apposite. It was probably more comfortable than our dining room, she added, except that the seat gave little grip when using the powerful brakes.On another occasion, my daughter Cicely, sitting in regal splendour on the pillion throne, pointed out I was rather tense while riding the Vision in town. And the manager of a motorcycle shop we parked outside was aghast that it had no reverse gear.“I thought you were having trouble pushing it backwards into that bike bay,” he said.As the ABS version weighs a truck-like 395kg even before filling the vast, six-gallon, 300-mile fuel tank, some degree of forward thinking is required – like not nosing into a kerb. It may be easier if you weigh more than 100kg and are 6’ 6” tall. For ordinary folk, technique is more important than size – and I could not get the technique down well enough to be comfortable, despite the low, 26.5-inch seat height.I am sure if you do enough miles on the bike, the weight will cease to be so important. But if you just keep it in the garage for sunny weekends and long trips, it will be a fresh learning curve each time you climb aboard. And then you may find, as I did, that all the attention has trouble compensating for the traffic-cursed bits at each end.This is a shame, as on the highway the bulk of the Vision disappears. Wide bars make it easy to steer, and the fairing does indeed deflect the worst of the weather. Cruising at legal speeds, propelled by the 1,731cc motor, is effortless. And it is all very civilised, with plush suspension and little apparent vibration from the motor, as should be the case for a bike with a purchase price starting in the UK at £17,495 ($26,500) before adding in the £1,000 electric reverse.Even Harley has struggled in the financial crisis, laying off workers, shutting its Buell sports- and touring-bike subsidiary and putting the recently bought Italian sports-bike manufacturer MV Agusta up for sale again. But Harley has also upped its game and made its bikes smoother and easier to ride.They cannot, however, compare with Victory’s bike for sheer visual impact. And neither can the closest Japanese offering, the rather civilised, American-built Honda Gold Wing.The Victory also has the extra cachet of rarity. If that is important, and if your riding consists mostly of long stretches of open road, and if you welcome the stares of awestruck onlookers, then you are squarely in the Vision’s sights."
82;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2010-03-16T20:45:31Z;Fed’s improving outlook lifts US stocks;;US stocks rallied as the Federal Reserve announced its widely expected decision to keep interest rates unchanged and gave a slightly more optimistic outlook on the state of the US economy and labour markets.“The Fed remains in no hurry to raise interest rates,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics, a research company. “The statement suggests that the doves still have the upper hand.”The Fed has room for manoeuvre said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, the wealth management arm of KeyCorp.He said: “With a large balance sheet, the Fed can maintain rates [as they are] and make small, incremental adjustments that attract less fanfare [than a rate change].”“However, inflation will be an increasing concern unless energy prices flatten.”US housing starts for last month fell 5.9 per cent to 575,000, as expected. Bad weather in the northeastern and southern US damped construction.Housing permits also fell 1.6 per cent but are running ahead of starts, usually a sign that new building is set to rise in the future.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent at 1,159.46 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 10,685.98.The Nasdaq was 0.7 per cent higher at 2,378.01 – its highest level since August 2008.General Electric, the infrastructure, finance, and media company, led the Dow higher, gaining 4.5 per cent to $18.07 – its highest price in two years – on positive broker comment and news that it would resume paying a dividend to shareholders in 2011.The company has “earnings momentum slowly building” and “for the first time in more than 10 years, the pieces are in place for earnings upside”, said JPMorgan in a note to clients.Limited Brands was 4.2 per cent higher at $24.71 as the company, which owns the Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works retail chains, said it would issue a special $1-a-share dividend and start a $200m share repurchase programme. The stock is at its highest level since July 2007.Starbucks was up 3.6 per cent to $25.29 as the global coffee shop chain was raised by UBS to “buy” from “neutral”, citing strong earnings growth expected for the next two years at least.The broker raised its earnings per share forecast to $1.34 from $1.27 to reflect “the growth potential from international cost savings opportunities, the global roll-out of Via [instant coffee] and licensing of Seattle’s Best Coffee”.The Japanese steakhouse chain Benihana surged 8.8 per cent to $6.40 on reports that the company is the target of a bid by Russell Glass, a former Icahn Associates executive. It is reported that he has offered $7 a share.Ford rose 0.7 per cent to $13.49 on comments by Alan Mulally, the company’s chief executive, that he expected the carmaker to pick up market share in the US as Toyota grapples with a global product recall of several of its models.Also, UBS raised the stock’s target price to $15 from $13 and retained its “buy” rating.Harley-Davidson firmed 7 per cent to $28.35 on renewed speculation that the motorcycle maker may be acquired in a leveraged buy-out. The company has not commented on the proposed takeover.Genpact, an outsourcing company spun off by General Electric, lost 6.7 per cent off its shares to $14.91 as it forecast lower current-quarter sales than analysts were looking for.Cliffs Natural Resources, a leading iron-ore producer in North America, rallied 4.9 per cent to $66.27 as the stock’s target price was raised from $65 to $85 by Deutsche Bank.Intel Corp was one of the best performers in the Dow, gaining 4 per cent to $22.01 as the chipmaker said it had already shipped more than 100,000 units of Xeon 5600, a server chip that went on sale on Tuesday.Oriental Financial Group rose 5.8 per cent to $12.25 as it announced it had placed a 7.6m share offering at $11.40 a share. The Puerto Rico-based lender expects net proceeds of about $87m from the offering. The offer is at a 2 per cent discount to the stock’s Monday closing price.
83;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2010-02-19T23:14:39Z;Don’t expect moonlit dawns;Director Luc Bondy has the European predilection for grand ideas and abstraction, but can be bracing in his judgments;"I was shocked. I didn’t expect it. The whole hall was vibrating around me. I thought the walls were going to fall in. I have never had a reaction like that before. All I could think was that if someone had had a gun, they would have shot me.”Chomping on a beefburger in the Young Vic café, Luc Bondy remains calm as he reflects on the calamitous reception prompted by his new production of Tosca at New York’s Metropolitan Opera last autumn. Calm, but still a little incredulous. “I mean, if you see it, it is not as if it is very shocking …”The audience at the Met evidently did not agree, booing lustily as soon as Bondy made his curtain call, thrusting the veteran European director on to the world’s front pages the following morning. “You know, opera audiences on a first night,” he continues, from the safe haven of one of London’s most happily eclectic theatrical spaces, “they come, they invite clients, they drink champagne, they don’t want to be disturbed. I am not against people who are rich. But there is a kind of …vulgarité in the air.”Ouch. That will teach them. Having watched a recording of the notorious production, I find myself in sympathy with Bondy. I had expected to see jarring anachronisms and gratuitous gimmickry: Cavaradossi roaring in on a Harley Davidson, Tosca lighting up a joint at the family planning clinic, all that kind of thing. But the production was in period and, if anything, rather restrained. True, Scarpia has a cheeky interlude on the sofa with three loose-ish women, one of whom makes a beeline for his agitated manhood. But check out what he is singing: “Violent conquest is far more exciting than gentle consent! I care not for sighs and milky moonlit dawns!” This is not Cary Grant.Bondy has another pop at his audience. “I think they expect Scarpia to be elegant, upright, in the Tito Gobbi tradition.” But, truth is, he is a sleazebag rapist, and Bondy wants people to know it. He is, finally, philosophical about the episode. “There was a cabal that was pro-Zeffirelli [director of the much-loved production that preceded Bondy’s version]. And then, even he attacked me, without knowing me!” He shakes his head again. “I was very surprised. Puccini is good. But it’s not the Bible.”Bondy is in London to direct the Young Vic’s new production of Arthur Schnitzler’s early play Liebelei, freshly adapted by David Harrower under a new title, Sweet Nothings.There is, as Bondy acknowledges, more room for manoeuvre here than in Puccini’s pious crypts and battlements. The Viennese playwright’s deceitful moral universe has inspired such notable adaptations as David Hare’s The Blue Room and Stanley Kubrick’s final film, Eyes Wide Shut. There is little trace of innocence in Schnitzler’s work; just a usually tragic conjunction of irresistible forces – social snobbery, erotic allure – and fatally vainglorious protagonists.Bondy lauds the contemporary resonance of Schnitzler’s insights: “The way he talks about sexuality is completely modern.”Bondy is the epitome of the itinerant European director, having worked in most of the continent’s major opera and theatre houses. He took over Berlin’s Schaubühne after Peter Stein’s resignation in the 1980s, and is currently director of the Vienna Festival, to which Sweet Nothings will travel in the spring. He has the European predilection for grand ideas and abstraction, but can be bracing in his judgments. When he mentions the great Viennese author Robert Musil, I express regret that I have never read his masterpiece, The Man Without Qualities. “It is unreadable,” he replies quick as a flash. “I think people are afraid to say how boring it is.” His desert island author, he says, is Proust. He pauses. “And Dostoevsky.”I say it is remarkable to observe the grip of fin-de-siècle Viennese culture on modern sensibility: you can’t turn the corner these days without bumping into multi-million-pound Klimts or being hosed down with post-Freudian psycho-babble.“Freud wanted to meet Schnitzler,” says Bondy. “He said: ‘You write what I think about.’ But Schnitzler was afraid that it would disturb the way that he wrote. He didn’t want it to be analysed. They never met.” The challenge of directing Schnitzler, he says, is in “finding the balance between lightness and melancholy”. It is a tension he sees everywhere. “It is a mistake to think of Oscar Wilde as only funny. It is very black.”That’s not how it is normally played in Britain, I say. “All work is best appreciated outside the country in which it is produced. You never see the best Shakespeare in England, the best Molière in France.” Twenty-first-century London may just be the perfect place for Schnitzler. Just don’t expect any milky moonlit dawns.‘Sweet Nothings’, Young Vic, London. March 1-April 10. www.youngvic.orgpeter.aspden@ft.com

84;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2010-01-01T22:35:37Z;Harley-Davidson revs up to lure Indian fans;;For most Indians, the term “chopped hog” would probably summon up visions of roast suckling pig in Goa, one of the country’s few pork-eating states.But recently, bike fans in Mumbai’s gritty former textile mills district got a taste of what American author Hunter S. Thompson meant by the term in his book, Hell’s Angels.In a publicity event before the formal opening of sales in India next year, US classic motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson turned over a collection of its “hogs” – the CVO, Touring, Softail, Dyna and Sportster models – to local enthusiasts for test rides.“Maybe today a young Indian who sees a Harley can’t afford it,” Anoop Prakash, Harley-Davidson’s India director, says of the bike’s starting price of Rs700,000 ($15,000). “But if he falls in love with the bike now, he’ll buy it when he can.”Harley-Davidson is the latest of the world’s motorcycle brands to target the Indian consumer. The country is the world’s second-largest two-wheeler market after China, with sales of 3.52m units in the first half of the fiscal year ending next March, up 15 per cent against a year earlier.While Harley will appeal to the richest urban riders, the bulk of the Indian market– and the attraction for mainstream motorcycle companies – lies at the lower end of the consumer pyramid, particularly in the vast rural hinterlands.Harley’s motorbikes serve every possible transport function, from commuter vehicle and family car to beast of burden and even a gift as part of a dowry.The market leader is Hero Honda, 26 per cent owned by India’s Munjal business family and 26 per cent by Japan’s Honda.The company, which began business in India in 1983 and today makes more than half the country’s motorcycles, has had a blockbuster start to the financial year in spite of the downturn, with sales up 21 per cent year-on-year between April and November to 3.04m units.Its main competitor is homegrown motorcycle producer, Bajaj Auto, whose market share in November reached nearly 27 per cent, up from about 23 per cent earlier in the year, on the back of sales of new models. Bajaj sold 11 per cent more motorcycles between April and November against a year earlier.Rural areas today account for about 40 per cent of Hero Honda’s sales, a number that is expected to rise steadily beyond 50 per cent in coming years as rural incomes increase, Pawan Munjal, the chief executive of Hero Honda, said.With motorcycle penetration in rural India below 7 per cent of the market compared with about 25 per cent in urban areas, there is plenty of room for growth.“The sales ratio between rural and urban sales is slowly inching up, and I do believe the bigger growth will keep coming from the rural market,” Mr Munjal told the Financial Times.Some analysts believe a poor monsoon this year could curb rural spending, with farmers preferring to put on hold discretionary purchases such as motorcycles until the fate of their crops becomes clear.“Farmers are indeed upgrading from bicycles to motorcycles. Even those who don’t need motorcycles are buying them. With the bad monsoon, they may put this on hold,” HSBC analyst Sachin Gupta said in a recent report.But farmers still have extra money in their pockets after a $16bn government farm loan waiver.The government has also increased its support prices for crops by 11 per cent, a move that should offset the loss of income from the monsoon, according to Jatin Chawla, an analyst at IIFL, a Mumbai-based brokerage.The other much-touted threat to India’s motorcycle market is the emerging “ultra low-cost car” segment, led by the Tata Nano, with a starting price of about Rs100,000.Tata Group chairman, Ratan Tata, says the Nano’s direct target market is motorcycle users. But analysts say motorcycles are still far cheaper to run. Not surprisingly, Hero Honda’s Mr Munjal is also a sceptic.“The Nano is priced closer to premium end bikes, and the premium end bike user is not a Nano user,” says Mr Munjal.Harley-Davidson’s Mr Prakash is not targeting Nano buyers. With other high-end motorcycles making inroads into India, such as Italy’s Ducati, he is keen to spread the religion.Harley plans to open five dealerships in the country’s most prosperous cities and states next year.Marc Billimoria, a banker and one of the test riders, said: “We’ve never had something like this in India …it’s a dream come true.”

The group, which is considered an economic bellwether of business activity and consumer spending, said its forecast reflected the outlook for fuel prices as well as a modest pace of economic recovery.Futures extended their early declines on Wall Street after data showed an unexpected rise in the number of Americans filing fresh claims for unemployment benefits.“Admittedly, the job claims numbers weren’t great but the leading economic indicators and the Philadelphia [Fed] numbers were terrific,” said Phil Orlando, chief market strategist at Federated Investors. “I would have thought that the market would have been acting much more positively.”However, Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said that a distinctive pattern had begun to emerge on Wall Street since August.“We’ve been cautioning people to watch out for the latter part of this month,” he said. “The market has normally been strong in the early part of the calendar month until right around options expiration and then it’s been weak in the latter part of the month.”Citigroup shareholders’ losses also continued to mount up after the bank sold $17bn of shares at such a low price that the the US government was forced to delay the partial sale of its stake in the bank. The shares, which have already lost almost 20 per cent this week, were down 6.7 per cent at $3.22. Citigroup’s problems weighed on investor confidence in the sector, helping to send S&P financials down 1.2 per cent.By midday, the S&P 500 was down 0.9 per cent at 1,099.21, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had also lost 0.9 per cent to 10,342.80 and the Nasdaq was 1 per cent lower at 2,185.00.The financial sector was also hurt by Meredith Whitney downgrades. The banking analyst group cut its forecast for Morgan Stanley, sending the group’s shares down 3.9 per cent to $29.16. Meredith Whitney, which is headed by the analyst who won a following on Wall Street for her warnings about toxic assets in 2007, also reduced its forecast for Goldman Sachs, prompting the bank’s shares to drop 2.1 per cent to $161.57.Harley-Davidson added to the downbeat mood, falling 4.6 per cent to $25.66 after Goldman Sachs added the motorcycle manufacturer to its conviction sell list.Analysts at the bank said they expected year-on-year sales in October and November to have dropped 35 to 40 per cent: a steeper decline than Wall Street’s current consensus. Earlier this month, the manufacturer said it would cut almost half of its workforce at its central Pennsylvania plant.Among the market’s gainers, Pier 1 Imports, which sells imported furniture, reported a third-quarter profit after analysts had predicted a loss. The retailer said it had benefited from improving sales as well as cost cuts, sending its shares up 5 per cent to $5.23.While Rite Aid posted a third-quarter loss, it was smaller than expected, sending the shares up 10.5 per cent to $1.47. The country’s third-largest drugstore chain reported fewer charges than last year and also said its pharmacy division had shown particular improvement.General Mills edged 0.7 per cent higher to $68.80 after the food company reported higher-than-expected results. The group, which owns brands such as Cheerios cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice-cream, also said it had boosted its advertising budget by almost 40 per cent.In deals news, Apollo Global Management announced that it was buying Cedar Fair at a 27 per cent premium to Wednesday’s closing price, sending shares in the amusement park owner up 23.4 per cent to $11.20.The total transaction was valued at $2.4bn, including the refinancing of the company’s outstanding debt, and ranked as the third-largest LBO this year, according to Capita IQ data.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
87;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-12-16T22:56:54Z;White House plans green tax break extension;;The Obama administration on Wednesday announced plans to extend tax breaks for clean energy investment by $5bn, hoping to simultaneously create jobs and increase the use of renewable energy.The proposal, which has to be approved by Congress, would allow new or expanded manufacturers of technology such as solar panels and wind turbines to receive a 30 per cent tax credit.“We have to jumpstart growth in green manufacturing – and part of that is encouraging companies to build the components of green technology right here on American soil,” Joe Biden, vice president, said when announcing the initiative.The $787bn economic stimulus package included a $2.3bn tax credit to support an additional $5.4bn in private capital investment in green technologies, which Mr Biden described as an “overwhelming success”.Mr Biden announced the extension of the tax credit after talks at the White House on Wednesday with the heads of manufacturers including Dow Corning, Honeywell, Procter and Gamble, Harley-Davidson and Goodyear Tire.The tax credit applied to the building and equipping of new, expanded, or re-tooled factories that manufacture the products needed to power the green economy, the White House said.The programme would cover technologies including wind, solar, batteries, energy efficiency, advanced transportation, and advanced energy transmission, it said.With the unemployment rate still at 10 per cent and the jobs market lagging the economic recovery, the administration is ploughing increasing effort into creating green jobs.President Barack Obama championed clean energy technologies at an employment summit at the White House last week and at a Home Depot store in Virginia on Tuesday, he called for tax incentives for homeowners who make their houses more energy efficient.“The simple act of retrofitting these buildings to make them more energy-efficient… is one of the fastest, easiest and cheapest things we can do to put Americans back to work while saving families money and reducing harmful emissions,” Mr Obama said on Tuesday.The programme is popularly called “cash for caulkers” after the popular “cash for clunkers” car subsidies offered over the summer.
88;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-12-04T01:19:00Z;Services sector dip drags on Wall St;;An unexpected contraction in the services industry last month and sharp sales declines among retailers pushed US stocks lower on Thursday.The services index from the Institute for Supply Management, which tracks businesses such as banks and restaurants, had shown the industry was expanding in October.After struggling to hold on to its early gains, the S&P 500 gave up in the last 30 minutes of trading and fell sharply, ending 0.8 per cent lower at 1,099.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 10,366.15 and the Nasdaq was down 0.5 per cent to 2,173.14.The market had initially been buoyed by data showing that fewer Americans had filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week.The figures came ahead of Friday’s closely-watched government report on payrolls, which analysts believe will show the unemployment rate has held steady at 10.2 per cent. But Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com, said investors had been nervous the rate could be higher. “Given that there was a surprise last time, people are concerned that we are going to get another surprise this time and no one wants to be out in front of that,” he said.Positive corporate news had also fuelled Wall Street’s early optimism. Comcast finally sealed an agreement to take control of NBC Universal from General Electric. The deal, which values the unit at $30bn, will create one of America’s largest media companies.Comcast also said it would increase its dividend by 40 per cent and would complete a $3.6bn stock buyback in the next three years, helping boost its shares 6.5 per cent to $15.91. General Electric lost 0.4 per cent to $16.Shares in Bank of America advanced 0.7 per cent to $15.76 despite heavy declines among financials after the country’s biggest lender agreed to repay $45bn of federal bail-out funds. The bank plans to sell up to $18.8bn in securities that will convert into common stock once shareholders approve an increase in the bank’s shares.Retailers weighed on the market throughout the day after more than 80 per cent missed their November sales estimates.Like-for-like sales at Saks, the upmarket department store chain, plunged 26.1 per cent during the period, sending its shares down 5 per cent to $5.90.Shoppers also spent less at Macy’s over the Thanksgiving holiday, resulting in a 6.1 per cent sales decline last month.Its shares dropped 3 per cent to $15.81. All sectors of retail performed worse than forecast but the biggest disappointments came among the clothing chains catering to teenagers.But shares in Collective Brands, which owns the Payless Shoesource chain, jumped 7.6 per cent to $21.71 after the group reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter.Collective said it had benefited from a successful back-to-school season and stronger sales of boots.Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle manufacturer, said it would cut almost half of its workforce at its central Pennsylvania plant. But after a long-running dispute with its union, it agreed to keep the site open rather than moveto Kentucky. The shares dropped 3.2 per cent to $28.63.Toll Brothers, the largest luxury homebuilder in the US, posted a bigger than expected loss in the fourth quarter.However, the group also reported a strong rise in new contracts, indicating that conditions in the industry were improving. The shares still fell 7.5 per cent to $18.02. An unexpected jump in pending home sales had buoyed the sector this week.UTI Worldwide climbed 12.1 per cent to $14.85 after the shipping company reported third-quarter sales above estimates.The group said the number of goods sent by air had increased in October, marking the first rise since early last year.
89;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-09-12T00:22:30Z;Triumph takes on Harley-Davidson;;"As I rode under a dark grey storm along the narrow roads of Buckinghamshire, large pellets of rain splattered down relentlessly, gathering in my lap. This wet, gloomy weather is far from the biker’s dream of big, blue skies and empty highways. But that hasn’t stopped British bikemaker Triumph from aiming squarely at the American biking idyll with its latest cruiser, the Thunderbird.It is a confident but risky move: in reaching for the cruiser market, Triumph has had to play by the rules that have put Harley-Davidson in the leading spot and kept it there.Cruisers are long and low; they have flat or high handlebars. They have forward foot-pegs and little cornering clearance. These defining characteristics describe a traditional Harley – but they also sum up what many buyers expect of any motorcycle. Just as most car drivers would regard with great suspicion any vehicle that did not have four wheels, most cruiser riders would not look favourably on a bike without these classic features.Triumph already has cruisers in its range. The Rocket III, for example, with its 2,300cc engine, outdoes most in the big and wide stakes. But the Thunderbird is aimed at the traditional middle sector, an area in which it has not yet pitched a contender.Harley has been hit by the recession, so this is a good moment to strike. Such is Triumph’s bravado, it even boasts of plans to be the second-biggest seller of cruisers within 10 years. So it has been assiduous in following the rules, and the Thunderbird has all the styling that buyers of these motorcycles demand.But where Japanese bike makers have also aped Harleys by using V-twin motors, Triumph has given itself a unique selling point with a parallel twin engine. This layout harks back to Triumph’s 1950s and 1960s heyday, but it has been cleverly modernised by giving the engine an architecture that makes it sound very similar to a V-twin. Ignition of the two cylinders is 270 degrees apart, which means that the bike has the offbeat exhaust rumble familiar to all cruiser riders.At 1,597cc, or 98 cubic inches, the engine can supply enough grunt to move the rather portly motorcycle surprisingly quickly. And, operating through a six-speed gearbox in which top gear is an overdrive, and a belt rather than chain final drive, it delivers a smooth and sophisticated ride.Which is slightly more than can be said for the chassis. It is accomplished enough, so that it feels safe, but gives a rather remote feeling from the wheels. Especially when using the powerful brakes.And then there is the riding position. Bombarded by raindrops, I felt as if function had lost out completely to style. With arms and legs out, even 70mph is not comfortable for any length of time. And that riding position made it impossible to avoid my spine being jarred as the bike tried manfully but failed to iron out moon-crater-sized Buckinghamshire potholes.When I first saw the pillion accommodation that I would be asking the Professor, my partner, to use, my heart sank lower than the height of the rider’s seat. However, after an admittedly short ride she was favourably impressed. While the rear seat is tiny, it has enough padding that the Professor pronounced it better than any Harley she has sampled.Triumph does, however, offer more comfortable seats, and a range of alternative parts. As the company points out, Harley buyers tend to spend about £2,000 on accessories. Buyers of Triumph’s own Rocket III tend to spend upwards of £1,500. More than 1,000 accessories designed alongside the bike are already on offer from Triumph, including a big bore kit which takes the engine up to 1,700cc, with a commensurate increase in power and, of course, grunt.Even without adding masses of chromed engine covers and other parts to the bike, it looks good. The single-colour bikes are also rather sophisticated and understated – which is a hard act to pull off with a machine that is all about attracting attention.There are aspects that are less effective. The built-in steering lock is separate from the ignition switch, so less usable. It is also pretty much the same as the one on the 1966 Triumph Tiger Cub I once owned, which makes a mockery of progress.But for riders seduced by the endless highway dream, who want something other than a Harley but with more character – and heritage – than the Japanese offerings, the Thunderbird could well hit the right spot.The quality could even, as Triumph hopes, succeed in winning over riders of other types of bike. But unless the only riding they do is on Arizona highways, or at the very least sun-soaked byways elsewhere, they should include in their riding dreams the likelihood of acting as an outstretched sponge when it rains.………………………………..The detailsTriumph ThunderbirdHow much

90;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-08-27T17:21:56Z;Harley-Davidson plots India sales drive;;Harley-Davidson said it planned to start selling its motorcycles in India next year, in a clear move to exploit the subcontinent’s fast-growing market and mitigate losses suffered in the US.India is the second-largest market for motorbikes and is dominated by small and inexpensive models – which cost on average less than Rs60,000 ($1,227) – and are used as an alternative to cars.India, where motorcycle sales have grown 15 per cent this year, could help lift Harley, which slashed its sales forecast for the year in July after having reported a sharp drop in its US and global sales due to the financial crisis.“Given the rapid development of India’s economy and physical infrastructure, this is exactly the right time to bring the world’s greatest motorcycles to one of the world’s largest motorcycling nations,” said Matthew Levatich, Harley’s president.Analysts are sceptical about whether Harley’s premium bikes will be able attract Indian bikers given that the starting price will be $14,000 - double the cost of a 883 model in the US. The reason of such hike is that the Milwaukee based group will have to add a 105 per cent duty on all its motorcycles, said Anoop Prakash, Harley-Davidson India’s managing director.“They can expect decent sales only if they price it competitively, say starting at Rs700,000 ($7000),” said Debsena Banerjee, an automotive analyst. “If not, then with people spending less in today’s time, Harley might find it tough selling the desired number of bikes.”The other main challenge for Harley will be India’s creaking roads and highway infrastructure. Although India’s transport ministers Kamal Nath said this year that the government would spend about $21bn to overhaul the country’s road network, it could take years before plans are implemented.“We are encouraged by the [Indian] government’s investments made into infrastructure. We are bringing into India the second chapter of motor bike riding,” Mr Prakash said.Harley, which has opened a subsidiary close to New Delhi and has begun looking for dealers in India’s main cities, has not yet said which models will be on sale in the subcontinent and at what price.The US group will also merchandise accessories and riding equipment throughout the country and Mr Prakash did not rule out plans to start manufacturing certain parts of the Harley in India.The company’s main competitor would be India’s Royal Enfield – a direct descendant of the famed British motorcycle maker – whose designs are little changed from the 1950s and whose bikes also enjoy a cult status among vintage bike aficionados.Royal Enfield, based in the southern city of Chennai, India’s automotive hub, has seen its business grow more than 20 per cent this year and plans to add four new dealers to the existing 149 in the country.Yamaha, Honda, Ducati and Suzuki are the other main foreign competitors with which Harley will have to battle for market share.
91;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-07-16T20:40:46Z;US stocks rise in choppy trade;;"US stocks rose close to their highs for the year on Thursday after a late rally pulled the markets out of a range following a choppy morning.The afternoon’s gains were fuelled in part by words from prominently bearish economist Nouriel Roubini that the recession would end this year.That helped overcome early nervousness about the ramifications of a possible bankruptcy by CIT Group, the commercial lender.CIT, which is struggling to fund itself, said there was no “appreciable likelihood” of a government bail-out, leaving the company facing a bankruptcy filing.The shares collapsed 75 per cent to 41 cents, and the effects were felt on the rest of the market.“We might not see the effect of a CIT bankruptcy straight away but, if somebody doesn’t step in to fill the gap they will leave in the market, it will have an effect on medium-sized businesses and so on unemployment,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim.This was enough to keep markets subdued during the morning, in spite of a record drop in the number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits.Even impressive profits from JPMorgan were not enough to spark an early rally.The bank reported revenues and profits easily above what analysts expected on record income from its investment banking side.The shares fell 0.4 per cent to $36.13 after a weekly gain of over 12 per cent.But stocks pulled out of their range after Mr Roubini’s comments and data showed sentiment among homebuilders rose in June.Homebuilders jumped on the data, with Lennar gaining 4.4 per cent to $9.55 and Pulte Homes picking up 3.9 per cent to $9.02.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.9 per cent at 940.74, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 8,711.82 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.2 per cent to 1,885.03.There was support for the markets from the technology sector, with IBM rising 3.2 per cent to $110.64 as investors bet correctly the company would beat profit estimates when its results were released after the bell.Biogen Idec rose 0.9 per cent to $47.10 after the company managed to increase revenues by 10 per cent from the previous year, boosted by strong sales of its multiple sclerosis drugs.Rival Baxter also beat expectations with its earnings. The company raised its earnings forecast for the year and the shares rose
3.1 per cent to $54.74.The healthcare sector also showed strength, triggered by positive earnings from two biotech companies.But microchip maker Xilinx knocked confidence in the sector after its results disappointed after Tuesday’s strong showing from market leader Intel.Shares in Xilinx fell 1.9 per cent to $20.26 after it warned that profit margins could be squeezed this year even though it beat its estimates for the past quarter.Marriott International also disappointed investors even as it reported net income above what analysts had forecast. The hotel operator’s shares were down 6.2 per cent to $20.44 as the company refused to provide guidance for the next quarter, saying the “current global economic and financial climate continues to make predictions very difficult”.This also knocked shares in rival Starwood Hotels, which dropped 2.8 per cent to $21.13.Mobile handset maker Motorola was a heavy faller, losing 4.2 per cent to $6.33 after European rival Nokia warned of shrinking profit margins amid continued declines in global sales.Harley-Davidson shares were volatile in the morning after the release of its quarterly earnings, dropping to $16.65 before climbing 8.4 per cent to $18.96 as it beat bearish estimates and said it would cut 1,000 more jobs.The gain came even as profits fell 90 per cent and the company warned of “continued weak” consumer spending for discretionary purchases.Meanwhile shares in Mosaic, the fertiliser company, leapt 12.2 per cent to $49.98 after a Brazilian newspaper reported that Vale, the Brazilian iron ore miner, may bid for the company at $56 per share."

The forecast is 25 to 30 per cent lower than the 303,479 units the company shipped in 2008.The company said it was cutting 700 blue-collar and 300 salaried jobs in what Mr Wandell described as “difficult actions”. Earlier this year, it said it planned to cut 1,400 to 1,500 production jobs and 300 non-production positions this year and in 2010.“We ware committed to doing what is required to enable Harley-Davidson to operate as a competitive business and employer over the long haul,” said Mr Wandell, who took over as chief executive from James Ziemer in May.Harley-Davidson’s second-quarter net income was $19.8m, down from net income of $222.8m a year ago. Revenue was $1.15bn, down 27 per cent from $1.57bn in the second quarter of 2008.The company took a $72.7m credit loss provision for the reclassification of its motorcycle loan receivables, plus $28.4m impairment charge on its earnings relating to the 1995 purchase of Harley-Davidson Financial Services, its credit division.HDFS has been hit by rising credit losses and restricted access to capital markets over the past year, and lost $62.1m in the second quarter.The company said it would temporarily shut or slow down production lines at four engine and assembly plants in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Missouri. It said a decision would be made later this year on the status of its York, Pennsylvania assembly plant.Harley-Davidson said it still expected its full-year gross margins to be between 30.5 per cent and 31.5 per cent.

But for the 13,000 screaming fans in the Mandalay Bay arena in Las Vegas, the brutality on display was what they had paid hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of dollars to see.Welcome to the world of Ultimate Fighting Championship, a mixed martial arts (MMA) contest that last Saturday celebrated its 100th broadcast event. From relatively humble beginnings when it was shunned by media companies and attacked by politicians, UFC has become one of the US’s fastest-growing media properties thanks to careful management of its broadcasting rights and a ruthlessly efficient promotions strategy.Privately owned by three high school friends, the brothers Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta, and its president, Dana White, UFC has tapped into a growing public appetite for violent sport. Its marquee fights take place in a cage called the “Octagon” and are broadcast live in the US via pay-per-view on satellite and cable television, and regularly outstrip boxing title bouts.Last Saturday’s event is expected to have generated more than 1.3m pay-per-view sales, with each buyer paying $44.95 to watch three tightly contested bouts. It was broadcast live or nearly live in 70 countries.UFC’s success and the willingness of the public to pay for televised fights is in no small part due to Mr White, the company’s president. Stocky, shaven-headed and prone to expletive-laden outbursts, the former amateur boxer owns 10 per cent of the company and is in charge of day-to-day operations.Mr White is also UFC’s public face, signing fighters to exclusive contracts, negotiating deals with an array of heavyweight sponsors that include brewer Anheuser-Busch, the US army and Harley-Davidson, and fronting The Ultimate Fighter, a weekly UFC reality television show on Spike, a Viacom-owned cable channel.“We think this is going to be the biggest sport in the world,” he told the Financial Times before the start of Saturday’s event. “If you think about the NFL, there’s nothing bigger in the US. They are spending so much money trying to grow it in Europe but no one in Europe cares [about American football]. We put two guys in the Octagon and it’s something that everyone around the world understands. Fighting is in our DNA.”His confidence is borne out by UFC’s meteoric growth. SNL Kagan, a research and consulting firm, estimates that UFC generated $40m in pay-per-view sales in 2005, increasing to $270m by 2008. Lorenzo Fertitta told the FT that he expects the company to generate revenues of more than $300m in 2009, with first quarter revenues up 41 per cent.UFC also has one of live sporting events’ highest average ticket prices of $276. Front row seats at UFC 100 were going for more than $10,000 a piece on the secondary market, although most tickets usually range from $75 to $1,000.Deana Myers, a senior analyst with SNL Kagan, says UFC is the most lucrative pay-per-view property in the US, making more money each year than boxing. “They’re generating a huge amount of pay-per-view buys compared with boxing,” says Ms Myers. “Boxing doesn’t have the talent that it used to have when Mike Tyson was around. UFC has positioned itself well and has a huge fan base.”Yet the competition came close to imploding in the years after it was launched in 1993. It achieved instant notoriety after its first contest, when one fighter was punched so hard that his teeth flew out of the cage. Senator John McCain, an early critic, called the sport “human cockfighting” and worked hard to have it banned.Lacking legitimacy and commercial appeal, the brand began to struggle and in 2001 it was bought by the Fertitta brothers for a knock-down price of $2m.Mr Fertitta says the first four years were “rough” and they have invested more than $40m since purchasing UFC. Mr White says the company had to secure legitimacy before it could grow commercially. “The old owners would put the fights on where there were no sanctions, so eventually Senator McCain went to the cable companies to get it banned,” he says. “When we bought it we decided to do things differently. We ran towards regulation.”When Zuffa, the Fertitta-owned holding company, bought UFC, the competition was banned in 45 states. Mr White introduced new rules to shake off the infamous “no-holds barred” tag and now UFC is sanctioned in 40 states.Embracing regulation was a sound commercial decision, adds Mr White. “This many people want to see a freak show,” he says, holding his hands a short distance apart. Then he opens his arms wide. “But this many want to see a sport.”UFC may have been toned down from the days when anything was permissible apart from eye-gouging, but it is still a violent sport. Strikes with the knee and elbow are acceptable, as are choke holds that can render fighters unconscious.There were plenty of fighters in need of medical treatment on Saturday: the first two bouts ended when the losing fighters passed out and needed to be revived. By the end of the evening, the mat in the Octagon was covered in blood.The clash between Brock Lesnar and Frank Mir was the evening’s most hotly anticipated fight. With a neck as thick as a tree trunk, Mr Lesnar, a former college wrestling champion, used his superior weight to pin Mr Mir to the mat while striking him in the face, a technique known as “ground and pound”. By the fight’s swift conclusion, Mr Mir’s face was a bloody pulp.Mr White argues that UFC is no more or less dangerous than other contact sports and he points out that no one has ever died fighting in UFC, unlike boxing.The violence is also inherent to UFC’s appeal, helping it defy the recession and steal fans from the fake theatrics of World Wrestling Entertainment.“There has been a shift away from staged wrestling towards the realism of UFC,” says Ms Myers.The business model also differentiates the sport. Unlike boxing, where fight promoters work with broadcasters and arena owners, UFC has complete control over its commercial activities. This seems to have worked in its favour. “A boxing promoter like Don King will do the deal to get the fight staged and that’s it,” says Mr White. “The venue will stage the fight and sell the tickets and a TV company like HBO will sell it on pay-per-view. We rent the arena, we sell our own tickets, we put it on pay-per-view …we risk everything every time we put on a show.”Mr White controls UFC with an iron grip. He forced a chastened Mr Lesnar into a humiliating apology after Saturday’s bout after the fighter said he would not be drinking Bud Light – one of the event’s sponsors – “because they don’t pay me nothin’”.Mr White’s success with UFC has also spawned imitators. Elite XC, a rival MMA group, enjoyed a brief spell in the spotlight last year when it signed a deal to broadcast bouts on the CBS network. But the company burned through cash and despite attracting large audiences, it staged only three events for the network.A key moment was the 2005 launch of The Ultimate Fighter, which follows 16 fighters battling to win a six-figure UFC contract. Mr White calls the show UFC’s “Trojan horse”. Before it launched, UFC’s pay-per-view fights would do well if they exceeded 100,000 sales. Thanks to the programme, interest has exploded.“They have done a great job building a brand and awareness via their show on Spike,” says Mark Cuban, owner of HDNet, which broadcasts rival MMA events. “They then leveraged that into an enormous following, which in turn led to the great pay-per-view numbers.”Mr Cuban adds that UFC “absorbed a lot of losses” to achieve its dominance. “It won’t be easy for other promotions to compete with the UFC, but it’s certainly possible,” he says.Rivals are also cropping up internationally – Japan, for example, is a hotbed of MMA. But UFC’s international appeal is also growing, and fights have been held in the UK and Germany. One event last year in Montreal attracted 21,000 fans, the largest audience for an MMA fight in North America.UFC is televised in 100 countries and broadband expansion could allow the group to broadcast global pay-per-view events using its own web-based platform.“When everyone can watch TV on the internet, how many pay-per-view buys do you think we’ll do?” says Mr White. “Four million? Five million? We can take this all over the world.”
94;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-07-02T14:07:13Z;Expert warns of dangers to consumer lending arms;;Rodgin Cohen, chairman of law firm Sullivan and Cromwell and a key architect of several US bank rescues, has called on the Obama administration to refrain from forcing non-banking companies to sell or close their lending arms as part of a proposed bank regulatory overhaul.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Cohen also called for changes to accounting and tax rules that he said were suppressing bank merger activity.The Obama administration’s regulatory proposals were “well thought through”, said Mr Cohen. But one facet that could pressure companies into selling or shuttering their consumer lending units – part of a government effort to separate banking activities from other types of commerce – appears ill-advised, he said.Groups including General Electric, Target, UnitedHealth, General Motors and Harley-Davidson have built industrial loan companies and trusts. These ILCs allow companies to accept Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured deposits, make loans to customers and issue credit cards, but are less regulated than traditional banks.Detractors of the model say that letting retailers or manufacturers perform banking functions can pose a systemic financial risk. But Mr Cohen, who is an advisor to GE, said these financing arms did not present problems in the recent crisis. At the very0 least, he argued, companies that have already put money and effort toward ILCs should be “grand­fathered” and allowed to maintain them.US Bancorp chief executive Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the Financial Services Roundtable, echoed that sentiment in an interview and said forced closures or sales of ILCs could hurt consumers who rely on those loans.“Competition is good,” Mr Davis said, in contrast to some bank executives who decry the model. “Taking those institutions away doesn’t make sense.”“Sloganeering is easy,” Mr Cohen said, referring to the concerns over mixing banking with commerce. But “even if you accept [this] argument, the right answer would be to reinstate the barrier or make the barrier stronger but permit the companies that have been able to utilise both to continue.”Forced sales of industrial banks or other financing arms, he warned, could cause collateral damage to the businesses and consumers who use their lending services.Mr Cohen, whose firm advises on corporate mergers and acquisitions, also said purchase accounting rules that force an acquiring bank to mark a target bank’s loans to market are “nonsensical”. The rules would generally result in huge markdowns in today’s climate, and many potential acquirers are not willing to shoulder that burden.Bank deals could also become more prevalent if acquirers could use their target’s losses to shelter more of their profits against tax, he said, in the way Wells Fargo and PNC were handed tax breaks for their purchases of Wachovia and National City.
95;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-06-12T15:04:30Z;Glass: Artistic, modern and covetable;;In their quest to find new materials to give a fresh look to their designs, jewellers are turning to glass. Not in any attempt to use the crystal as a faux gemstone because it is less expensive than precious stones or because buyers in this economic climate are searching for a less ostentatious look. The simple reason is that glass is fashionable.Not since René Lalique, the master glass-maker in fin de siècle Paris who revolutionised the world of jewellery with his Art Nouveau sets of jewels worn by Sarah Bernhardt, has glass been so a la mode.So why the sudden return to glass? For a start, the design has improved because a number of avant garde designers are using the material for “artistic” jewels in modern covetable pieces. Tom Binns, whose pieces are worn by Michelle Obama, is at the forefront of the trend with his Glass Beach jewellery containing pieces washed up on the shore in California where he lives. He mixes the glass, which has been smoothed by the salt water, into ethereal pieces dripping with crystal and rhinestones. “The design blunts the edge and the pieces have a lustre and texture,” says Nathalie Kabiri of Kabiri. “People love that whole found object or treasure thing.”Kabiri also stocks work by Josh Hickey, an American designer based in Paris. The jewel-like pieces are made from old French wine bottles that Mr Hickey smashes and sets into edgy, shaped, oxidised silver and 18-carat gold. Glass jewels have their roots in the 19th century when the crystal was set with foil in an attempt to make it resemble a diamond. But new modern glass style is not trying to masquerade as anything valuable. Ms Kabiri says: “It’s the fact that they are working in a material that isn’t expensive that allows the designers to be freer and experiment with more abstract pieces.”When it comes to bigger pieces, no one is doing anything punchier than Katie Braine and Charlotte Legge at Legge & Braine. The company makes huge glass knuckledusters like giant cakes in vibrant colours.Neighbours in London, with artist printmaking and sculpting backgrounds, they set up their jewellery business five years ago, determined to work with glass.“We wanted to use the industry that exists in Murano in Venice,” says Ms Braine who was living in Venice at the time, “we were inspired by the wonderful artists we found there”.Legge & Braine is encouraging the artisans who do “lamp work” (working with multiple layers of glass with bumps of colour on the surface or plunged into the centre like a floral design) away from tourist souvenirs towards flamboyant designer-led jewels. “We don’t speak Italian and they don’t speak any English,” laughs Ms Braine, “so it leads to some interesting mistakes”. The new collection for the autumn is called Champagne Supernova which are star shaped solid cabochon super-sized rings in psychedelic colours with centre stones of tiger’s eye, lapis lazuli, garnet and turquoise for women with strong fingers to balance, as Ms Braine puts it, “the star ship Enterprise”.So impressed were the glass experts at Maison Baccarat in Paris that the house commissioned Legge & Braine to create a collection.The use of young guest designers at Baccarat has transformed the company’s collections from unadventurous pieces your maiden aunt might wear to groundbreaking graphic contemporary work. The French art craftsman, Stefano Poletti, has created Pampilles for its autumn-winter 2009 collection which is a range of statement pendants and earrings based on the chandelier drop.Lalique’s philosophy is to twist the inspiration of its historic pieces. “We like to take something around our cultural heritage,” says Caroline Scholl, head of design, “and make new stories for a new stage.” René Lalique favoured three classic themes of femme, faune and fleur, which led to a magnificent bestiary of exotic women, extreme versions of creatures such as dragons and serpents as well as plant life. “We give the ideas a trendy forward-looking feel,” says Ms Scholl.The Cabochon ring designed by René Lalique is still one of the best sellers in more than 14 shades. The new collection called Daydream comes in abstract shapes but in Lalique’s emblematic frosted satin-finished glass surface work. The next collection has been inspired by modern architecture and art, “We don’t follow trends,” says Ms Scholl, “we try to set them.”Carol Woolton is Jewellery Editor of British Vogue……………………………………………Designers diversify to attract a wider customer base in a tough retail marketAs Kate Moss scaled the zebra-striped steps of the Metropolitan Museum for the Costume Institute gala last month, her Marc Jacobs gold lamé dress failed to capture the attention of her peers, writes Nicola Copping. Instead, all eyes drifted upwards … to her turban.Nestled among the twists and turns of the Maharajah-inspired headpiece sat an 18-carat, royal blue sapphire by the jewellers Harry Winston. By co-designing a bejewelled turban with Ms Moss herself, Harry Winston had leapt beyond the traditional parameters of fine jewellery and directly into high fashion.The jewellery company is not the only one to make the leap. Although it may not be bejewelled turbans that tickle the fancy of every modern jeweller, the conventional fare of rings, earrings, bracelets and necklaces are now simply not enough for the more experimental.Take Solange Azagury-Partridge. At the Unwearable Jewels exhibition at London’s Sebastian & Barquet gallery, she unveiled decorative objects for the home that incorporated precious and semi-precious stones, including handmade carpets, tables, plaques and, the star of the show, a shimmering chandelier encrusted with 200 carats of diamonds worth $2.8m. “The customer wants something different now,” says Ms Azagury-Patridge. “If I’m anything to go by, I wouldn’t want a generic piece of jewellery or something that everybody else has.”For many established brands, diversifying their product output has become part of their DNA. Van Cleef & Arpels has produced a precious metal clutch bag every year since one of the Arpel brothers saw a top client shovelling her necessaries into a tiny cigarette box in the 1920s. Cartier has been producing clocks, pens, vanity cases, book ends, lipstick holders, ink pots and board games for more than 100 years.Chopard, meanwhile, decided to diversify into accessories several years back by introducing bags, pens, sunglasses, ties and porcelain. “Many of the accessories in our collection are at an accessible price point which allows new young customers to step into the Chopard world more easily,” says Caroline Gruosi-Scheufele, the brand’s co-president.From Theo Fennell sterling silver ketchup sleeves to Versace’s crystal furniture, De Grisogono’s silver incense burners to the Australian fine jeweller Calleija’s diamond-encrusted champagne coupes, the possibilities for jewellers to use their talents beyond the conventional means are becoming increasingly prevalent. Indeed, diversifying and attracting a wider customer base is becoming a necessity in an increasingly tough retail market.Jean Christophe Bedós, CEO of Boucheron, says: “Jewellery and watch-making continue to have pride of place, but other creative fields must also be explored.” Boucheron’s Magnetic Quatre gold cube paperweight has been created to coincide with the launch of the film Home and is inspired by the Boucheron Quatre ring.For the most extreme example of innovation, look no further than jeweller Stephen Webster.He has applied his skills to a Grey Goose vodka ice bucket, a Perrier Jouet bottle stopper, a customised guitar and even an embellished Vespa and a Harley Davidson.
96;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-04-27T22:03:46Z;Macao’s City of Dreams bets on high rollers;;On Cotai Strip, a reclaimed area in Macao billed as Asia’s answer to Las Vegas, workers are busy putting the finishing touches on City of Dreams, the newest casino in the former Portuguese colony.With a dome-shaped theatre, a Hard Rock-themed casino, stylish nightclubs and Harley Davidson motorcycles in the jackpot, Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) is betting that the $2.1bn project will be able to defy a slowing market in Macao and a deepening global recession when it opens its doors in June.In 2008, gaming revenue in Macao grew by 31 per cent to $13.5bn but there was a sharp slowdown in September after Beijing imposed visa restrictions that curtailed visitors to casinos from some parts of mainland China. High-rollers, meanwhile, also found it more difficult to tap credit as the global financial crisis worsened.For Lawrence Ho, son of “king of gambling” Stanley Ho and MPEL’s chief executive, the success of City of Dreams is not only crucial for his company but also the empire of the Ho clan, the most powerful family in Macao.When Macao ended Stanley Ho’s 40-year gaming monopoly in 2002 and granted licences to international tycoons, including Sheldon Adelson of Las Vegas Sands and Steve Wynn of Wynn Resorts, some called it the end of an era.Analysts predicted Sociedade de Jogos de Macao (SJM), Stanley Ho’s gaming flagship, would lose its leading position as early as this year as bigger casinos and shinier gaming floors built by US rivals were expected to outdo his smoky gambling dens.In 2004, when Mr Adelson opened Sands Macao, the first casino operated by a foreign investor, doors were smashed and fences broken as gamblers forced their way in.The opening of Wynn Macao in 2006 and Venetian in 2007 continued to captivate the crowds and put more pressure on Stanley Ho.But five years on, SJM is still the biggest casino operator in Macao, the world’s largest gaming market.Las Vegas Sands and MGM Mirage, SJM’s heavily-leveraged foreign rivals, have recently been preoccupied with refinancing loans taken out during the boom times.Las Vegas Sands has stopped construction of its partially-finished developments on Cotai, where most building work by other casino operators has also been halted.Cranes now loom over idle building sites.The company, which has been struggling to offload its real estate and retail properties at the Venetian, has also declined to comment on speculation that it would sell Sands Macao, saying only that it would continue to explore all options.Analysts have speculated that cash-strapped MGM Mirage, which has a Macao joint venture with Pansy Ho, Stanley Ho’s daughter, could be forced to sell its 50 per cent stake in the tie-up, most likely to its partner.“By maintaining its leadership for so long, SJM has proved a lot of people wrong,” says Billy Ng, analyst at JPMorgan, who expects Stanley Ho to maintain a lead until at least next year.With Lawrence Ho and Pansy Ho, the Ho family has three of Macao’s six gaming licences and control about half of the sector, which has grown about five times since 2002.“Their market share may be smaller but don’t forget the pie is much bigger now,” says Gabriel Chan, an analyst at Credit Suisse.Adding to this is Shun Tak, Stanley Ho’s conglomerate, which has been benefiting from the territory’s breakneck growth in the last few years thanks to its vast interests in Macao’s property, transportation and hospitality industries.All these give the Ho family an upper hand again.City of Dreams is set to put MPEL, a partnership between Lawrence Ho and James Packer’s Crown group, in the best position to benefit from any turnround in Macao’s gaming sector.The property is likely to be the only large-scale casino opening in the enclave in the next two to three years.It is estimated to double MPEL’s market share to about 17 per cent in 2010.Although casino revenue in the first quarter of 2009 dropped 13 per cent from the same period last year, it was 8 per cent higher than the level in 2008’s fourth quarter and in line with the third-quarter figure. This is in spite of the fact that the beginning of the year is traditionally a low season.According to Morgan Stanley, gaming revenue in Macao is expected to decline 11 per cent in the first half of 2009 but is likely to rebound by 4 per cent in the second half of the year.“The worst is likely to be over as long as there are no more big corporate problems,” says Francis Lui, deputy chairman of Galaxy Entertainment, a Macao casino operator. “This year I am cautiously optimistic.”
97;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-04-20T21:19:47Z;Sacked in the City;;"Disappointing news for Harley-Davidson salesmen and providers of cordon bleu master classes – the number of City bankers facing redundancy is shrinking, with estimates of job losses in the wholesale financial services sector falling by 15 per cent in six months. The Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy, now reckons 29,000 bankers will slink off clutching black bin bags this year, down from its October estimate of 34,000.Even that figure will mean a hefty 10 per cent of those in wholesale finance will lose their jobs this year – on top of the 28,000 scythed down in 2008 – in spite of some stabilisation of financial markets. Peak to trough, ranks will be thinned by 16 per cent, to 295,000, down from a high of 353,000 in 2007. This is about twice the estimated peak-to-trough fall in UK gross domestic product. A decade of job creation in the sector will be reversed in just 24 months.Even if the pessimism continues to abate, Alistair Darling, the chancellor, should remain concerned over the health of his most valuable cash cow. Tax revenue from the financial services sector this financial year could tumble 42 per cent from its 2007 level to £39bn – a loss equal to four-fifths of the country’s defence budget. Lost income tax and National Insurance contributions as well as shrunken corporation tax and value added tax receipts account for the bulk of this drop.The big question is whether the sector undergoes a structural decline in profitability as higher capital requirements against trading books and reduced regulatory tolerance of leverage depress returns. In a world of low interest rates, in which fund managers struggle to offer 3-4 per cent returns, high fees will be hard to swallow. Barring a collapse in the rest of the economy, the days when the financial sector contributed 14 per cent of all government taxes revenues have gone for good.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

98;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-04-16T21:03:45Z;Tech and media stocks lift Wall Street;;Technology and media stocks staged a late rally on Thursday to take the equity markets higher after a day spent struggling for traction despite good results from JPMorgan.Investors bet on good results after the bell from Google, taking the company 2.4 per cent higher to $388.74. The company then reported better than expected profits. Google was joined by Apple, which rose 3.2 per cent to $121.45 and Microsoft, gaining 4.9 per cent to $19.76.Hewlett-Packard was another major gainer in the sector, rising 5 per cent to $36.60 after research firm IDC said the company had taken top spot in the US PC manufacturing market last quarter from Dell.Media companies also benefited from the bets on Google, as well as better than expected results from publisher Gannett.Gannett, which publishes USA Today, gained 3.2 per cent to $3.60 despite profits falling 60 per cent. Later in the day it was joined by bigger media conglomerates. Time Warner rose 6.8 per cent to $23.73 and Disney lifted 4 per cent to $20.51.“Media companies have been very beaten up and we would expect them to see some gains as the economic data improves,” said Tuna Amobii, an analyst at S&P.This helped take the Nasdaq Composite index to new highs for the year, up 2.7 per cent at 1,670.44 points. The benchmark S&P 500 index also rallied, rising 1.6 per cent to 865.30 points, as did the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which picked up 1.2 per cent to 8,125.43 points,.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Sun Microsystems bounced on news that it had asked IBMto resurrect takeover talks, but pared those gains when CNBC said IBM rejected the approach. Sun finished 4.4 per cent up at $6.40. IBM was 2.6 per cent higher at $101.43.Earlier, positive job figures and better than expected earnings from JPMorgan struggled to boost investor confidence.The country’s second-largest bank by assets reported earnings that beat expectations by about one-third, helping the stock gain 2.1 per cent to $33.24. But JPMorgan’s results were counterbalanced by Lincoln National after the insurer’s debt and financial-strength ratings were cut by Moody’s, which said it might downgrade the company again unless it received the $3bn in federal money it is seeking. The stock fell 4.6 per cent to $9.62.Figures showing US housing starts fell by 10.8 per cent in March, more than analysts had predicted, also weighed on financials.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said: “I think a lot of the gains from JPMorgan were already priced in and financials are focusing on the data on housing starts.”Regions Financial, the regional bank, surged 34 per cent to $6.70, however, after Dowd Ritter, the chief executive, said the company would make a profit for the first quarter, with analysts having previously predicted a loss.Data showing initial jobless claims fell less than expected in the week ending April 11 failed to spark a major rally. Investors were more concerned that the number continuing to claim such benefits had risen above 6m for the first time since records began.There was good news from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve which said that manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region had slowed its decline in April.But confidence was tempered when General Growth Properties, the second-largest US owner of shopping centres, filed for bankruptcy protection. This exacerbated fears that commercial property would be the next shock for the market. Real estate companies initially tumbled before being caught in the late buying. Prologis gained 1.9 per cent to $8.61.Harley Davidson made better earnings than expected and reaffirmed its full-year outlook on shipping numbers. Its shares rose 5.7 per cent to $18.11.Southwest Airlines took some of the sheen from the airline industry, however, after AMR’s narrower than expected losses. Southwest lost more than expected, as low demand took its toll. Its shares fell 7.1 per cent to $7.10.Rosetta Stone provided confidence for stocks after it beat estimates for its initial public offering. The language instruction company sold shares at $18 after expectations of a maximum $17, and then rose 39.6 per cent during the day to $25.12.
99;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-04-07T21:21:45Z;Engineer makes big noise;;In India, one of the most used components of any motor vehicle is the horn. Drivers navigating livestock, pedestrians, animal-drawn carts and motor vehicles lean heavily on their horns to express frustration, if not to clear a path. Trucks are emblazoned with the slogan “horn please”.Responsible for much of India’s distinctive road noise is Roots Industries, a small private company that is also the country’s biggest hornmaker. It was founded in 1970 by K. Ramasamy, a US-trained automotive engineer, now 60, who has been obsessed with auto horns since his childhood in an affluent land-owning family near the southern town of Coimbatore.Mr Ramasamy’s fascination stems from his father’s habit of installing a German-made Bosch horn in every car he acquired. “He said no Indian horn would last,” Mr Ramasamy recalls. “It stuck in my mind that I should make horns similar to Bosch, so we would not need to import.”Little known outside the auto industry, Roots has quietly integrated into the global economy over the past 15 years or so, supplying both leading Indian vehicle makers such as Mahindra & Mahindra, and foreign marques such as Harley-Davidson. Throughout most of 2008, Roots ran three shifts a day, six days a week, turning out 400,000 horns a month for its home market and for export.Now, as global vehicle sales have slumped, Roots has cut production to two shifts a day, five days a week, to make 173,000 horns a month. It has cut its workforce by 25 per cent to 875, mainly shedding single young men. But with one Indian worker often supporting up to five people, Roots has also sought to slash labour costs by reducing shifts and salaries rather than by shedding workers completely.“It is predominately a social responsibility to keep them as far as the company can withstand,” Mr Ramasamy says. “They don’t have any facilities like unemployment benefits.”Despite the difficulties, Roots’ revenues for the year ending in March 2009 are Rs965m () although they are expected to fall below Rs900m in the year ahead.The challenges confronting Roots are typical of those facing the countless small manufacturers that helped drive India’s years of fast growth and are now struggling to survive the global downturn.After India loosened its tight economic controls in 1991, numerous private entrepreneurs such as Mr Ramasamy emerged from traditional landowning and trading families to meet pent-up domestic demand for manufactured goods and tap the new opportunities offered by globalisation.But after ramping up operations, these small manufacturers are reeling. “People didn’t believe that growth would slow down,” says Subir Gokarn, chief economist for Asia Pacific for Standard & Poor’s.Indian manufacturers are theoretically bound by strict labour laws that make it hard to shed permanent workers. In reality, many factory owners in the worst-hit sectors have simply ceased operations and closed their premises as they wait for the global economy to recover.Roots employees have long re­ceived monthly statements of the company’s performance and have stoically accepted their falling pay, says Mr Ramasamy. “We have profit-linked salaries for everybody,” he says. “Everything is transparent…Whatever actions we take, they understand the need for such actions.”Back in 1970, the young engineer’s quest to create durable Indian horns to rival those of the German company began on his return from the US with a master’s degree in automotive technology. To raise capital, he opened a garage and began fixing cars, shocking many in a conservative Hindu society with traditionally strict divisions between education and manual labour.“People thought: ‘Why is this boy getting into a garage with oil, mud, muck, dirtying himself’,” Mr Ramasamy recalls. “But I enjoyed it because it was my hobby. In our religion, it says ‘work is worship’. So how can we think differently of different work?”Initially the aspiring entrepreneur developed a radiator coolant recovery system and a brake system, but struggled with sales. “I had no financial strength for advertising,” he says. The 1973 Opec oil embargo was also a blow to Indian car sales, which averaged 50,000 a year in the 1970s.But after a decade of tinkering and materials research, Mr Ramasamy in 1982 unveiled a horn with a lifespan of 200,000 “cycles”, nearly double the local standard. Roots started selling them as spare parts, but in 1986 started supplying Maruti-Suzuki, then a fledgling car venture.By 1989 Roots was the largest hornmaker in India, then still a tiny market constrained by state production quotas. But growth ac­celerated after government reforms in 1991. “Business really began picking up,” says Mr Ramasamy. He attended his first overseas trade fair in 1992 and started exporting to the Middle East and Europe two years later.As he built the business, Mr Ramasamy wrote three times to Bosch to request a partnership. He had to be patient: it was only after two decades from his first contact that Bosch signed a long-term technical collaboration and buy-back agreement with Roots – a moment Mr Ramasamy recalls as “a great joy”. To finance the deal, he sold a 25 per cent stake in Roots to Reliance Industries, although Reliance plays no active role.Roots also pushed into the US market, setting up an engineering and marketing office in Cadillac, Michigan, to work with leading US carmakers, although it has now closed because of the downturn in the US market. By 2004, it supplied half the horns used by Ford Motor Co in North America from a $1m, purpose-built factory. But Roots ended the arrangement last March after Ford pressed Roots for lower prices. “Raw material prices were going up very much, but Ford wanted to reduce the price,” Mr Ramasamy says.Roots also built a factory in Malaysia, which opened in 2003, to supply south-east Asia, although promises of a south-east Asia free trade zone have not been realised.With day-to-day management left to trusted professionals, Mr Ramasamy is still pursuing his quest for a lighter, more energy-efficient, longer-lasting horn.“We are working on many other products,” he says. “When the upturn comes, we will be ready.”
100;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-02-13T20:49:59Z;Berkshire Hathaway lends Tiffany $250m;;Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to invest $250m in bonds issued by Tiffany, the luxury jeweller, in the latest in a series of bond deals with stressed companies.For Mr Buffett, the deal marks the billionaire’s latest investment in a corporate icon. He has sought to capitalise on the downturn to buy stock or debt in companies ranging from General Electric and Harley-Davidson to Swiss Reinsurance and Goldman Sachs, in arrangements that often pay Berkshire a double-digit coupon.The retailer has been hard hit by the fall in US luxury demand, and saw its net sales in November and December fall by 21 per cent, with comparable sales at its US stores down by a third. As a result it expects to announce a fourth quarter loss when it reports results in March. Its efforts to refinance debt were also thrown into disarray when the credit crisis errupted in September.The crisis has pushed lower end US jewellers, including Fortunoff and Whitehall, into bankruptcy. But Tiffany has a strong luxury brand, and a strong international presence that has so far been less heavily hit by the slowdown.“This is more of him putting cash to work with companies he thinks will survive,” said Whitney Tilson, a managing partner at T2 Partners and a Berkshire shareholder of Mr Buffett’s move.Also, for an investor with more than $30bn in cash at the end of third quarter, the Tiffany deal “is not even a rounding error for him,” Mr Tilson said.Tiffany’s shares have lost a third of their value since September. It says it will use the proceeds of the bonds, which will have an annual yield of 10 per cent, to refinance its debts and for general corporate purposes.In November last year the jeweller at when the credit crisis broke it had been in negotiations to raise $300m to repay $100m of senior notes coming due this year, and to fund potential share repurchases.It subsequently sold $100m in bonds due in 2015 to institutional investors in December, at 9 per cent.Berkshire Hathaway is buying two tranches of bonds, maturing in 2017 and 2019 respectively.Berkshire has recently bought $750m in combined debt from Harley-Davidson, the motorbike maker, USG, which makes construction walling and Sealed Air, the maker of Bubble Wrap.Mr Buffett also invested $8bn on preferred shares of General Electric and Goldman Sachs that pay 10 per cent, and bought $2.6bn convertible notes from Swiss Re, that pay 12 per cent annually.
101;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-02-06T19:32:01Z;Ultimate bargain-hunter never had it so good;;Warren Buffett’s highly anticipated – and usually entertaining – annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders will not arrive for at least a few more weeks. But many investors can probably guess at least one key theme to the latest dispatch: it was a tough year for both Mr Buffett and Berkshire.Berkshire’s profit has slumped for five consecutive quarters, a streak expected to continue when the company reports its fourth-quarter results. Its class A shares have dropped 37 per cent since the start of 2008, battered by concerns for Berkshire’s derivatives losses and portfolio of financial stocks, barely besting the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 Index during that period.While too soon to tell, Mr Buffett’s October New York Times article encouraging Americans to buy stocks has yet to prove prescient.And, despite his years of unrivalled experience, like everyone else, Mr Buffett is learning to come to terms with an economic downturn unlike anything investors have experienced in their careers: even if, as he said last month during a television interview on PBS’s Nightly Business Report, “my approach to investing I learned in 1949 or 1950 from a book by Ben Graham and it’s never changed”.Yet in one important sense, Mr Buffett, the ultimate bargain-hunter, is having the time of his life. He has found deals, at extremely favourable terms, with some of the world’s best-known and respected companies, including General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Wrigley, Dow Chemical and Harley-Davidson.“In his younger days, whenever the market crashed he never had enough money,” said Alice Schroeder, author of The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life.“This is the first time in his career he’s had enough capital to take advantage of the opportunities presented to him.”His latest – this week’s £2.6bn investment in Swiss Re, the struggling reinsurer – will pay Mr Buffett hefty annual interest as well as giving him the right to raise Berkshire’s stake at an attractive price.And with few willing to predict the imminent recovery of the global economy, Mr Buffett’s buying spree should continue. Berkshire had more than $31bn in cash at the end of the third quarter.Ms Schroeder, a former stock analyst who wrote the biography with Mr Buffett’s co-operation, said the billionaire had remained “restrained” in his approach to investments, guided by a deeply held suspicion that there was always “a better deal that comes along”.“People who think they don’t like his terms now may like them better in a year,” she said.A call to Mr Buffett’s office was not immediately returned.While Mr Buffett’s October letter alluded strictly to a decision to add stocks to his personal investment account, the search for a higher return than what cash provides is a strategy he has embraced recently at Berkshire, too.“I’ll follow the lead of a restaurant that opened in an empty bank building and then advertised: ‘Put your mouth where your money was’,” Mr Buffett wrote. “Today my money and my mouth say equities.”The steepening downturn will only add more opportunities to the menu and, chances are, Mr Buffett is still hungry.“My greed quotient has risen as stocks have gone down,” he told PBS. “There’s no question about that.”
102;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-02-05T21:53:34Z;Free-traders quiet on Buy American;;To judge by the reactions in Europe, Canada and Asia, the Buy American provisions in the economic stimulus bill that restrict some federal spending to goods from US companies are the opening salvos of a global trade war.But the most striking thing about the debate within Washington is how long the measures took to get noticed – and how little they are perceived as a protectionist act.The dwindling band of free-trade Democrats on Capitol Hill has been almost completely silent. It was two weeks before Barack Obama, US president, made a partial criticism of the provisions, saying they should be modified to be compatible with World Trade Organisation rules.Now that the Senate has narrowed its version of the provisions, an uneasy compromise is likely to emerge where Congress agrees the strongest set of restrictions that does not violate US commitments under the WTO and the North American Free Trade Agreement.Looking at the political environment and Mr Obama’s own journey to the White House, perhaps that is not surprising. Along with his well-known criticisms of the effect on jobs and wages of deals such as Nafta, Mr Obama’s campaign singled out Buy American as a symbol of economic patriotism.Last summer, according to the political website Talking Points Memo, the Obama campaign distributed stickers in the Pennsylvania rustbelt saying: “Buy American, Vote Obama”.In Wisconsin, home of the classic Harley-Davidson motorbike, it ran a radio ad mocking Mr Obama’s opponent, John McCain, for opposing a requirement that the US government buy American-built vehicles.Sherrod Brown, a Democratic senator from Ohio and leading light of the self-styled “fair traders” on Capitol Hill, says that opinion has been shifting away from untrammelled free trade for some time. “With each election, the Democrats coming into Congress have a much clearer sense of how American workers have suffered from the downside of globalisation,” he says.But even for those who still identify themselves as supporters of free trade, Buy American is a difficult issue on which to take a stand. Donald Manzullo, a Republican congressman from northern Illinois who has long campaigned for such measures to be more strictly enforced, points out that domestic content rules have been a feature of government procurement for over 70 years.“I believe in free trade,” he says. “I have voted for every free trade agreement put in front of me. All I want is for federal, state and local procurement officers to follow the law.”Mr Manzullo alleges hypocrisy among those European governments threatening litigation over Buy American. “Companies like AgustaWestland [a UK-Italian enterprise] ought to be thanking George W. Bush for buying his Marine One helicopter from them rather than Sikorsky,” he says. As he points out: “European procurement rules are far more restrictive.”It is a view echoed by Lori Wallach, director of the Global Trade Watch programme at Public Citizen, a liberal consumer group sceptical of the benefits of trade pacts. “Buy American is a very dangerous issue for any free-trader to take on,” she says. A wholesale 1930s-style raising of tariffs would evoke widespread opposition, Ms Wallach says, but restricting American taxpayer dollars to US companies brings out few principled opponents.The Republicans on Capitol Hill have concentrated criticism of the stimulus bill almost entirely on its effects on the US economy, not America’s standing abroad. Even Mr McCain, a staunch free-trader, introduced his unsuccessful amendment to strike the Buy American provisions out of the bill as something of an afterthought to his alternative stimulus programme.Criticism of the measure in Washington has largely been left to business associations such as the US Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable. “These are the same people responsible for outsourcing jobs abroad,” Ms Wallach says. “No one wants to stand alongside them.” Susan Aaronson, an expert on trade from George Washington University, notes that non-governmental organisations that are prepared to criticise US agricultural protectionism when it hurts developing countries are nowhere to be seen in the Buy American debate.The Washington reaction to Buy American suggests that much of Congress and the Obama White House, while still respecting existing treaty commitments, is not going to go out of its way to placate protesting trading partners. The judgment most experts made – that free traders within the Obama administration will have to spend most of their time playing defence – has thus far been vindicated.

104;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-02-04T00:54:08Z;Harley soars after Buffett buys debt offering;;Warren Buffett has given Harley-Davidson a vote of confidence by buying half of a $600m debt offering by the hard-pressed motorcycle maker.The move by one of the world’s most respected investors drove Harley’s shares up 15.8 per cent to $13.73 by the close of trading in New York on Tuesday.The shares have been pummelled in recent months by the softening motorcycle market and concerns about the company’s financial condition.The other half of the senior unsecured note issue was bought by Davis Selected Advisers, a New York-based portfolio manager that is already Harley’s biggest single shareholder.Neither investor was available for comment on Tuesday. Harley is the latest in a string of investments by Berkshire Hathaway, Mr Buffett’s holding company, which has been seeking to capitalise on the financial crisis by aligning itself with some the world's most successful brand-name companies. These include General Electric, Goldman Sachs and Mars, the confectionery manufacturer.The notes, which pay 15 per cent interest, were issued as part of a drive by Harley to strengthen the funding of Harley-Davidson Financial Services (HDFS), which finances its dealers and retail motorcycle buyers.This financing arm has been hit by rising credit losses and limited access to capital markets.The unit swung to a fourth-quarter operating loss of $24.9m from earnings of $38.6m a year earlier, and receivables held for sale have tripled to $2.4bn over the past year.Moody’s on Tuesday lowered the financing arm’s credit rating from A1 to A2, saying that “the downturn in the US economy, the erosion in consumer confidence and the contracting availability of credit are weakening the sales of Harley motorcycles, which are highly discretionary”.The debt issue will relieve the immediate pressure on HDFS, but the unit “still needs securitisation markets to improve or alternative options will have to be pursued”, according to Robin Farley, analyst at UBS.Ms Farley estimates that the notes’ high interest rate will cut Harley’s 2009 earnings by 18 cents a share.Harley last week reported a 58 per cent fall in fourth-quarter earnings to $77.8m. It also unveiled plans to cut 1,100 jobs, or 12 per cent of its workforce.The overall US motorcycle market shrank by more than a quarter in the final three months of last year as consumers continued to cut back on discretionary purchases.
105;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-01-10T02:29:44Z;Harley-Davidson’s new range of tourers;;"Joan Jett belted out the chorus to “I love rock ’n’ roll” into the desert air as I gunned the Harley-Davidson into the long sweeping turns of the hills that separate the Red Sea from the plain of the Sahara.The huge screen of the Ultra Classic Electra Glide kept the stinging sand out of my helmet, and kept the classic rock from the bike’s sound system in. On the surprisingly well-surfaced Egyptian roads, the touring motorcycle’s massive 400kg bulk seemed to melt away in the heat.The trip had not started so well. A delayed flight connection meant a night spent in a Cairo hotel lobby. When I finally arrived at the Red Sea to join Harley’s ride-out, I had time only for a shower before choosing a mount for the 280km tour over the hills and through the desert to Luxor.A night without sleep and a whole day riding Harleys, even the plushest and most comfy of the touring range, in challenging conditions should have added up to a waking nightmare. All too often Harleys are good on their own terms, but idiosyncratic to the point of obtuseness when compared to any other motorcycle. But the 2009 Harley range has undergone one of those stages in its evolution where the gradual improvement amounts to a recognisable step forward.Take, for example, the mounting of the V-twins that characterise Harleys. The big air-cooled lumps – of 96 cu in, or 1585cc – in the touring range have a large mass of metal reciprocating wildly when you rev them. That translates into a lot of vibration, which in the past has meant that using the engines’ top revs left you all shook up.Improved engine mounts isolate the rider much better. At times on that narrow strip of tarmac through the desert I had to check the rev-counter to know which gear I was in – our admittedly modest cruising speed of 100-130kph could be achieved in any of the top three gears. On last year’s bikes, buzzing the engine at its 5,500 rev limit was only for those with a total lack of mechanical sympathy.I must confess that I often find models from this Milwaukee manufacturer hard to distinguish. Aficionados and wannabe desperados can tell Harleys apart at a glance, but I find the Road King Classic, the Road King, the Electra Glide Standard and the Street Glide alarmingly similar in appearance. The Ultra Classic Electra Glide is easier to identify, as it is fully dressed in panniers, gigantic seat and so on. The rest differ more in details such as screens, pannier bags and the colour that the engine is finished in.Riding them, though, the differences are more apparent. The Road King’s main differences from the Road King Classic are the finish of the saddlebags, the shape of the seat, and a slightly bigger front wheel. Yet the larger wheel gives the Road King much more confident handling than its Classic sibling.All the touring bikes share a new, stiffer frame, and all have anti-lock braking – which saved my bacon when I saw, very late, a speed hump on an otherwise open dual carriageway, when our convoy at long last reached the fertile Nile valley. The anti-lock system comes in very early – but better that than not at all.Despite the improvements, all the bikes, not just the ones with “Classic” in their name, are styled to look like they could have ridden off the pages of a 1960s magazine. And they do a better job of blending tradition and technology than the guy I saw in Luxor talking on a mobile phone while riding an undersized donkey.However, he did a pretty good job of keeping up with our convoy. Even the shepherding skills of Sharif, the larger-than-life president of the local Harley Owners Group (HOG), could not stop taxi drivers jostling into our formation and slowing us down.Hidden behind the fairing of the Ultra and the Street Glide is a sophisticated sound system that had not just Joan Jett but also Mötley Crüe and various indistinguishable Steppenwolf tracks bouncing off the mountains. America’s “A Horse with No Name” might have been among them, and Neil Young’s “Unknown Legend” was hard to get out of my head (“Somewhere on a desert highway/She rides a Harley-Davidson/Her long blonde hair flyin’ in the wind”).It’s all part of the myth that Harley-Davidson taps into and that has made this brand so attractive to weekend warriors, or bankers who grow their hair before their annual HOG meet. But it doesn’t come without drawbacks. Even after two days on the bikes, the second covering a greater distance than the first, I had to think about how to use the idiosyncratic indicator switches. They might self-cancel but they are also more complicated than the one-button-for-everything simplicity of most other bikes. And the standard pillion seats slope backwards, which seems perverse unless it is aimed at tempting buyers into the 824-page accessories catalogue.Even within the self-referential world of Harleys, others in the current range are disappointing – for example, the XR1200, which is very self-consciously styled after the raw and successful XR750 that stormed to victory across many an American mile and half-mile oval track. But the touring bikes – especially, for me, the Road King – might even have made the crossover from good Harleys to good motorcycles.…………………The detailsHow much

106;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2009-01-07T21:46:00Z;Wall St falls on downbeat company news;;"Sweeping layoffs and profit warnings from a range of blue chips on Wednesday sparked the steepest Wall Street sell-off for more than a month and wiped out nearly all of the market’s new-year advance.All 10 of the S&P’s main sectors lost ground after glum corporate developments from the likes of Alcoa, Time Warner and Intel – coupled with a bleak labour market survey – heightened concerns that the year-long recession was deepening.The financial sector led the declines, down 5.1 per cent overall. Regional banks such as Regions Financial, off 10.4 per cent at $7.91, were among the hardest hit after Credit Suisse warned of the risk of more equity raising and dividend cuts. “The vast majority of regionals remain vulnerable to thinning core equity levels and outsized credit concentrations,” wrote Todd Hagerman, analyst.A rally in life insurance stocks came to an end after Keefe, Bruyette & Woods cut its price target on a host of companies in the sector. Lincoln National, which had rallied by about half over the prior month, gave up 14.4 per cent to $21.22.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley lost 4.8 per cent to $84.50 and 7.6 per cent to $18.10, respectively, after Sanford C Bernstein analysts highlighted expected lower revenue from lucrative equity underwriting both this year and next.“Virtually all the high-margin businesses of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are now declining or moribund – M&A, IPO, convert arbitrage, risk arbitrage, asset management and retail brokerage,” wrote the analysts, led by Brad Hintz.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 3 per cent at 906.65 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2.7 per cent weaker at 8,769.70 points and the Nasdaq Composite index 3.2 per cent lower at 1,599.06 points.The Vix, a closely watched technical measure known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, which last week fell to its lowest level since September, leapt 12.5 per cent to above 40 for the first time this year. The technology sector was one of the worst performing after lower revenue and margin guidance from Intel, whose shares shed 6.1 per cent $14.44.In the previous session, technology stocks had led the S&P to its highest level since November as investors snapped up cash-rich names, but the sector lost 3.7 per cent overall.Material stocks were also in focus after Alcoa became the latest company to unveil plans for job cuts – it intends to cut about 15,000 positions to cope with the recession.The market came under pressure from the outset after a report by ADP Employer Services showed that private sector US companies cut an estimated 693,000 jobs last month.The worse-than-expected figures sparked fears that Friday’s closely-watched non-farm payrolls report would show greater losses than already bleak forecasts.Alcoa shares were the worst performing on the Dow, off 10.2 per cent to $10.89 after the materials group also disclosed its third production cut in as many months.Monsanto helped pare the losses in the materials sector when it lifted its full-year earnings outlook after first-quarter profit more than doubled.Its shares rose 17.7 per cent to $86.16, but although the materials sector outperformed the wider market, it still dipped 1.6 per cent.The energy sector tracked the oil price sharply lower to end an eight-session winning streak, down 3.9 per cent overall.Offshore drillers came under further pressure after Citigroup issued a more bearish view of the sector.Pride International and Hercules Offshore lost 6.4 per cent to $17.88 and
4.4 per cent to $5.50, respectively, as the broker recommended clients sell the shares.Media stocks came under pressure after Time Warner warned that it expected to suffer a non-cash impairment charge of about $25bn in the fourth quarter and slashed its full-year financial outlook for 2008.Its shares dropped 6.3 per cent to $10.29, while Viacomlost 4.6 per cent to $20.97.Elsewhere, Harley-Davidson shed 12.4 per cent to $17.35 after Raymond James downgraded its view on the motorcycle stock to “underperform” after the analysts surveyed dealers to gauge demand."
107;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2008-11-13T23:29:05Z;DSLRs get in the picture;;"Some sounds like the “clunk” a quality car door makes as it is closed, the “chug” of a Harley-Davidson motorbike or the “click-swish” a single-lens reflex camera makes when you press the shutter button seem designed to be evocative.I have never owned a quality car or a Harley hog, but I have fond memories of the 35mm film-based SLR cameras I used to record many exciting events, places and people before the advent of digital photography. Although the motorised innards of most digital SLRs do not make that satisfying click-swish, they do generally help take excellent images, are easy to operate and fun to use.Many amateur photographers are well served by “point-and-shoot” digital cameras or a long-zoom fix­ed lens camera, but an SLR is a must for serious amateurs who want the flexibility and image quality that comes with an interchangeable lens system.Leading brands have this year launched several new digital SLRs (dSLRs) with innovative features, some only found on more expensive professional systems until now. These new cameras include Canon’s Digital Rebel XSi, known as the 450D in Europe, Nikon’s D90, Pentax’s K200D, the Olympus E3 and Sony’s Alpha DSLR-A350.Some general points: you get more dSLR features and higher megapixel counts for your money than even a year ago. But that does not mean the images will be better. As most professional photographers say, a good photograph is about much more than megapixels, shutter speeds and ISO (light sensitivity) numbers.Second, the dividing lines bet­ween what used to be called “high end amateur”, semi-professional and professional dSLRs have become blurred, especially since the price of the latest professional models, like Canon’s 21Mp D5 Model II, continue to tumble.Third, the lenses sold with most entry-level dSLRs are seldom the best choice. If you plan to get serious about digital SLR photography, you may want several fixed focal length and zoom lenses.Some of the features introduced in the latest dSLRs do make it easier to take high-quality images, and manufacturers are using them to differentiate their cameras. They include dust control, image stabilisation, extended dynamic range and “live view” screens.One problem with any interchangeable-lens camera is that dust can reach the digital sensor chip at the heart of a dSLR (look for little black spots in the same place in every image). To overcome this, most recent dSLRs feature dust sensors and dust control systems that either repel or shake off dust particles that enter the camera and land on the sensor.Image stabilisation systems help eliminate camera shake and make it easier to capture clear images, especially when using long telephoto lenses (200mm or more) or slow shutter speeds in low light without a tripod.Canon and Nikon have included image stabilisation technology in their lenses (typically designated “IS”) for years, but, others including Sony, Pentax and Olympus, have started building it into the camera body instead, and enabling owners to use any compatible lens, not just IS models. The importance of this depends on whether you anticipate buying more than a couple of lenses.Dynamic range enhancement is another feature of some of the latest dSLRs, designed to help take good pictures even when there is a big contrast range bet­ween light and dark areas of an image, eith­er by reducing the bright­ness of highlights or increasing the brightness of shadows. This seems to me “nice to have” rather than “must have”.“Point-and-shoot” digital camera users typically compose their pictures using the LCD panel on the back of the camera. In contrast, most dSLR owners compose pictures by looking through a viewfinder, like traditional film-based SLRs. But some of the new dSLRs feature “live view” LCDs, enabling users to use them just like point-and-shoot cameras.A growing number of dSLRs, inc­luding Nikon’s D90, are adding video recording capabilities – the D90 enables users to record high definition video clips. I am not sure how useful this is, but the D90 also takes excellent still images and is one of my favourite dSLRs.I am more concerned about factors like sensor size, image processing quality, start-up times, the accuracy of the autofocus system and continuous shooting speeds, and like most dSLR buyers, I am also swayed by the lenses I already own – in my case, mainly Canon.Indeed, among the dSLRs I have been testing, Canon’s 12.1Mp Digital Rebel XSi is probably the best value – it is slightly cheaper than the Nikon D90 but not quite as fast in continuous shooting mode or as good in low light conditions.Both have big bright 3in LCDs, updated image processing electronics and are comfortable to hold and operate. Although both lack in-body image stabilisation, their image quality is difficult to beat and they should be on any serious amateur dSLR buyer’s shortlist.paul.taylor@ft.com

108;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2008-10-16T18:47:29Z;Harley-Davidson;;Wall Street, usually slow to ditch a hot ride, spotted the potential for the wheels to come off fairly early with motorcycle-maker Harley-Davidson. As house prices cracked, pessimism abounded about a product that is essentially a luxury good for upper-middle class, middle-aged American men – one costing as much as an entry-level luxury car. Quarterly earnings confirmed the trend. Revenues sank nearly 8 per cent versus 12 months ago and earnings per share fell by one third. Last year was the first time sales declined since Harley went public in 1986.But with its share price down by two-thirds since the beginning of 2007 – the lowest level in nearly a decade – concerns about Harley’s future seem overdone. At eight times prospective earnings, the price no longer extrapolates the torquey pace of growth that saw unit sales double and revenues triple over the past decade. An admirable focus on profitability and a firm grip on inventory also are cause for optimism. Harley’s financing arm is a source of mild concern but the manufacturing business is far healthier than those of four-wheeled vehicles in Detroit. If there were a need to conserve cash, annualised dividends and buybacks combined amount to about $475m, or about half of last year’s net income. Lost market share this year to Japanese manufacturers such as Honda says more about high petrol prices than customer loyalty.Since the early 1980s, when its bikes were referred to pejoratively as “Hardly Ableson”, the brand’s value has risen steadily. The only problem is that loyal buyers are no longer rebels without a cause. Typically males in their late 40s, with half having owned a Harley before, they are being slowly augmented by international buyers. The recession will hurt but this 105-year-old American icon is selling for a bargain and still has plenty of road ahead.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click hereLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

109;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2008-08-30T00:19:09Z;Too hot to handle;;It had always whined. But when it started to screech I was forced to pay attention. The rear brake of the 1125R, from specialist US manufacturer Buell, had been made as cantankerous by roadwork-stymied London traffic as the taxi drivers around me – so it had decided to stick slightly. This resulted in a piercing, high-pitched noise that drowned out a constant whining from the gearbox. But a binding brake could not do more than slightly blunt the engine’s monstrous 146 horsepower output (great thundering horses bred to tame the American west).This is the first time Buell has designed its own road engine – although it is actually built by BRP-Rotax, an Austrian company that dominates the market in light aero-engines. In his 25 years of building quirky but sharp sportsbikes, Erik Buell, the company’s chairman, had always used heavy, slow-revving Harley-Davidson engines. But then, Buell is a former Harley man. And it all made more sense when Harley bought the company in the 1990s.This Rotax-built V-Twin unit is much more sophisticated and powerful than the Harley-based engines, but refined it is not.Every time I heard the mechanical mayhem of the engine, it amazed me that Buell could replace the ancient, noisy, clattery, barely silenced Harley engine with a brand new noisy, clattery, barely silenced motor. No fewer than three primary balance shafts in the engine calm down a lot of the vibration, but the aural assault of the engine and the bellowing exhaust is astonishing. In town, it verges on embarrassing – even without a screeching back brake.So it was with relief that I turned toward Turweston aerodrome in Northamptonshire. As I was in a rush, a motorway blast to get there revealed a fairing that worked well – perhaps too well. I could tuck in comfortably to the bike without feeling cramped, but was stuck in a pocket of air heated by the radiators.Passengers get a similar roasting. My partner, the professor, had commented on how much scalding air reaches a pillion passenger’s legs with other Buells. The 1125R was no better. My 12-year-old daughter, Cicely, also complained that there was no grab-rail to hang on to when we picked up speed, and that the tank was too far away to brace against when we braked sharply.I was going to Turweston to fly the latest Cirrus aircraft, reviewed here last month. That plane is the product of a pair of US entrepreneurs who founded Cirrus Design around the same time Erik Buell left Harley to go it alone. To complete a set of mould-breaking innovators, the Northamptonshire airfield is also home to engineer and motorcycle-maker Mick Broom, who has spent the past 25 years manufacturing the Hesketh V-twin motorcycle after the original company, founded by the eponymous F1-racing lord, went bust. Twice.The return journey to London showed the Buell 1125R in a better light. Shunning the overcrowded motorway in favour of fast, single-carriageway roads, overtaking was just a wrist-tweak away. The torque of the engine meant changing down a gear was rarely necessary. The bike is quick-steering but stable, with suspension that shrugged off mid-corner bumps. But the heat build-up presented another problem. Stopping for petrol, I filled up the tank – which is formed by the frame itself. This is ingenious, but as soon as the fuel was in the hot frame, it expanded and started to run out of the overflow – on to the very hot exhaust. Thoughts of flames fanning out beneath me kept me looking down at my right boot. But if I had been on fire, I would not have been able to hear warning shouts from other road-users.Fire risk apart, the bike has neat touches seen on all Buells: an exhaust beneath the engine, to keep the weight low and central, and a front brake that is both light and powerful. Such is its power and feedback that I hardly used the back brake. When I did, I wished I hadn’t, as I had to hook my foot underneath the pedal to lift it again and stop the screeching.Buell is fond of emphasising aggression in its bikes’ styling – and this one certainly looks low and mean. But also rather wide. Cicely thought it looked too much like a guppy from the front.Buell is no longer the only maker of aggressively styled sports bikes. This month, Harley completed the purchase of Italy’s MV Agusta, which includes the Cagiva brand – completing a curious circular path. When I first got into bikes, Harley had a huge line-up. I can still remember a double-page magazine ad that pictured all the models, including rebranded Aermacchi bikes made in Italy. American Machine and Foundry, owner of Harley from 1969, extended that Italian investment with the aim of broadening Harley’s appeal. (AMF also made parking meters, which for many aficionados crossed a line.) But in 1978, AMF sold the facility to Cagiva.After that, Harley made a textbook job of focusing on a single product. Now, with a range, including the Buells, that is already much wider than AMF could ever have dreamed of, it has diversified into Italian exotica. Again.That will give Buell some internal competition. The brand has already said it is improving the heat management of next year’s 1125R, as well as launching the 1125CR, which will have a more relaxed riding position but an even meaner look. As long as they bellow rather than screech, both should be a blast.More columns at www.ft.com/testdrive
110;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2008-08-27T17:31:25Z;Respectability and red tape at the bikers’ bash;;The man beside me at the motorbike festival drag strip made me nervous because he was a Hells Angel. I made him nervous because I am a journalist. The Hells Angels are the world’s most infamous motorcycle club. This is partly because journalists love writing about how infamous it is. Mutual suspicion results.I was there in pursuit of a story unremarked in the acres of print devoted to the club’s criminal connections. This concerns the counter-intuitive exploits of the British Hells Angels as an events management business.The Hells Angels are “one percenters”. These are motorcyclists who wear their condemnation as a lawless minority among bikers as a badge of honour. Hells Angels membership is not open to women, law enforcement officers or people who think motorbikes are boring. In Canada, Hells Angels are associated with drug dealing and in the US with violent affrays.In the UK the most public manifestation of this secretive club is as organisers of the Bulldog Bash, which I attended recently. Melvin Benn, founder of Festival Republic, which owns the huge Reading and Leeds music festivals, eulogises the event as: “An almost perfect example of a festival that gets it right. It knows exactly who its market is and does not try to be anything it is not.” The durability of the Bulldog Bash has business lessons to impart even if your favoured mode of transport is a BMW saloon rather than a chopped Harley-Davidson.According to Bilbo, the suitably Hobbit-like head organiser of the Bulldog Bash, the festival was set up 21 years ago to replace a defunct custom bike show in Kent. One weekend every year it attracts about 20,000 people to an airfield in Warwickshire. That makes it “one of the UK’s biggest small open-air festivals” by the standards of Neil Greenway, founder of the efestivals.com website.Mr Greenway doubts whether all of 2008’s record number of outdoor festivals will recur in 2009. Market latecomers and impending recession are stretching demand too thinly. Mr Greenway says: “The key to survival for smaller festivals is to have a clear target demographic.”The Bulldog Bash ticks this box as a bike festival run by bikers to which music has been added as an afterthought. Its core brand value is to celebrate biking as a revolt against authority rather than in its newer incarnation as a display of consumerism. This was encapsulated at the Bulldog Bash in the T-shirt slogan: “It takes more than co-ordinated leathers to turn a [expletive deleted] into a biker.”The attendance of crowds of men with alarming tattoos and motorcycle-club back patches added subcultural lustre to the event. But there are not enough of these customers to keep the festival going on their own. A wider constituency is attracted by the quarter-mile drag strip where riders can “run what they brung” – shred their tyres at speeds illegal on public roads. Mainstream motor-show organisers have only recently woken up to the potential of such entertainment.Admittedly the drag strip was not functioning when I visited it with Echo, a Hells Angel co-opted as a media minder. A yellow digger was making repairs, to derisive cheers from the crowd. Alternative fun was in full swing nearby. Helmetless stunt riders thundered round inside a Wall of Death, swerving up and threatening punters with decapitation before zooming deftly away. The live ammunition shooting gallery was doing healthy business. And in the music tent, heavy bands rocked dirtily.The selection of stalls along the site’s main drag also demonstrated a canny finger on the niche market pulse. If you needed a chrome exhaust pipe with a removable sound baffle to annoy your neighbours, you could buy one. If you wanted a fire-breathing witch-lizard tattooed down your spine, you could get it done on the spot. Concessionaires did not expect to make big profits but rents were correspondingly low.The Hells Angels on the 20-man committee running the festival are not aggressive in the commercial sense. They could easily jack up the entrance fee from £55 ($102, €69). Smaller music festivals charge £70 and upwards. Echo’s justification was that “most bikers don’t have a lot of money – after paying for a ticket they’ve just enough for a few beers and some bits for the bike”. That smacks of a mutual rather than a City ethic.The club is also unwilling to take risks with prices because it needs to balance returns with sustainability. Most private business owners ponder this trade-off, too. According to Bilbo, the bulk of any profits are ploughed back into future attractions. Last year, savings from past bashes paid for veteran plank-spankers Status Quo to perform.The biggest risks to the Bulldog Bash are reputational and regulatory rather than financial. “Gentleman” Gerry Tobin, a 35-year-old Hells Angel, was shot dead by an unknown attacker on the M40 after the 2007 Bulldog Bash. Local councillors ignored police advice to cancel this year’s festival. Warwickshire Constabulary responded with blanket security on local roads. The on-site security provided by the Hells Angels was rigorous, too. A hulking biker on the gate warned your wimpish, Volvo-driving correspondent that any misbehaviour would be punished with expulsion. Funny how a desire for respectability can creep up on outlaw bikers, just like everyone else.jonathan.guthrie@ft.comPost and read comments at www.ft.com/guthrie

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
112;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2008-08-07T19:19:23Z;Celebrate the past by looking forward;;"Intel celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, which makes it a Methuselah by Silicon Valley standards. To mark the event, the company will be donating 1m hours of volunteer work from its employees in areas such as humanitarian and environmental aid.“Individuals have the flexibility to choose what they do in terms of volunteer work, but it needs to be an NGO,” says Intel. “There will be individual celebrations, but we are very much focused on giving back to the community.” To provide an actual marker for the event, “we also worked with 500 kids around the world and asked them to describe what the next 40 years will be like with computers – and we have used these ideas to build an online mural, which we will turn into a physical print at some point”.Lego, the Danish toymaker, is a little older, marking its 75th anniversary last year. “We had a great party in Billund, Denmark, as well as parties at our global locations,” says Mads Nipper, executive vice-president for product development, marketing and sales. “There was a lot of active engagement from employees. At the main Danish party we invited all staff and former staff …It was like an amusement park with bands from each decade of the company’s life.”Lego also gave employees a €1,000 bonus. “We have a lot of anniversaries,” says Mr Nipper. Last year, the company marked the 50th anniversary of its iconic brick by bringing out a special edition of its first Lego kit, whose packaging included the sepia picture of a man using the bricks that appeared on the original box.Land Rover this year marks its 60th in a variety of ways. On its official birthday, Prince Charles visited the company’s Solihull factory. It also don­ated 60 vehicles, worth about £1m, to the Red Cross and the Red Crescent. There also was a celebration for employees. “All employees were invited to the Gaydon HQ for a weekend,” says Land Rover. “There is a book and an exhibition on the theme of adventure, with all proceeds going to Red Cross.”The company is not planning a big event for Land Rover owners but it anticipates that local enthusiasts’ clubs will run their own celebrations.Such styles of celebration are all a long way from the huge seated dinner for al employees, with a speech and a memento, that was traditional in the past.How businesses celebrate their anniversaries has changed greatly during the past 30 years, says Bruce Weindruch, founder and chief executive of History Factory, a company that helps organisations look after their past. “When we first started out, an anniversary was more an acknowledgement that you had achieved a milestone. A lot of that has gone, and the idea that old equates to good has disappeared,” he says.Now, the aim is to tie the celebration into something the company is doing at present. Fortnum & Mason’s 300th anniversary took place last year. One of the ways the company marked this was a £24m refurbishment of its landmark London store.There are good reasons for the modernisation of the company anniversary. First, we live in an accelerated business culture. To take an obvious example, the global range of the effect many Silicon Valley companies have had during the past decade would have been unimaginable 50 years ago. Intel is 40; Microsoft is 33; and Google has not even reached double digits – the 10th anniversary of its incorporation comes next month.Second, globalisation and the pace of mergers and acquisitions have made company histories more complex. Employees of a Malaysian subsidiary of a German conglomerate may not really care that the parent is 100 years old. Similarly, if a German brewery whose roots stretch back 600 years is bought by a 20-year-old American company, who should be celebrating, and what?“It should be localised as much as possible,” says business psychologist Ben Williams. “If you have a [south-east Asian] subsidiary, staff there are unlikely to give a damn how old the parent company is. You should celebrate anniversaries that are appropriate to them.”Another question concerns who the celebrations should be aimed at. For many companies, it is probably about staff, then vendors or suppliers. But for some businesses and brands, the customer element is much stronger.Harley-Davidson, which enjoys near-religious brand devotion from its customers, is having a relatively big celebration for its 105th anniversary, a milestone that companies with less devoted consumers and less iconic products might let pass entirely unnoticed.And, says Mr Williams, some anniversaries that should be celebrated are not usually regarded as huge milestones. “In some ways, I think the second anniversary is the most important of all,” he says. “If you’re a start-up and you survive for two years, you’re going to make it.”"
113;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2008-06-21T01:13:21Z;Flight test;;“Throw it about as much as you like,” tempts the voice at my shoulder. “You can’t break it.”The voice might belong to the reckless side of my ego. But in fact it comes from Mark Waite, European importer of the Super Decathlon, who is sitting behind me in the rear seat. Waite is more impish than reckless, but he is giving me free rein to tear up the sky.I had found him at his office, a room in the back of a hanger over the road from a sleepy airfield in Essex. After talking about cars and motorcycles (Waite has got the bug as badly as me – his collection of five motorcycles equals mine in number), we look at the aircraft I came to fly.The shiny Super Decathlon looks like a classic – and indeed it is, although brand new. Its manufacturer, Wisconsin-based American Champion Aircraft, is building a family of planes originally designed in the 1960s.Classic looks sell well in the US – a fact that American Champion’s near neighbour, Harley-Davidson, has been milking for years. Wing at the top of the fuselage, tailwheel undercarriage – the Super Decathlon is decidedly old-school, but also comfortably familiar to would-be pilots. “It’s like a Harley with wings,” says Waite. American Champion builds about 90 aircraft a year, of which half are Super Decathlons. Waite’s Blue Yonder Aviation brings about five a year to Europe.The aircraft, like present-day Harleys, have much modern refinement under their classic exteriors. Metal is used instead of wood in the wings, for example. But the construction would be familiar to the pioneers of flight – steel tube and aluminium covered by fabric.Another classic touch is the seating: the seats are one behind the other – not very sociable but it gives the pilot in the front an excellent view. And unlike many taildraggers the view over the nose when taxiing is good – which is useful when Waite and I have to go through a gateway, along a field and across the main road before we reach the grass runway at Earls Colne airfield.On the runway, the 180hp, fuel-injected engine means we are airborne almost as soon as I have brought the tail off the ground. And the constant-speed propeller enables the power to be exploited fully both when climbing and cruising. At 75 per cent power the Super Decathlon, despite its less-than-smooth lines, will zoom along at about 128 knots, or 147mph. That and the space in the back to throw in some bags mean you can use it as a tourer for yourself and one other.But it is also a brilliant toy for de-stressing after a long week. We find a former airfield turned into a quarry to play over. The massive scar on Essex’s fields is a reference point for when I become confused about where the sky and the ground should be. And that might happen because we are here to explore something that the Super Decathlon does rather well – aerobatics.The aircraft can cope with plus six and minus five times the force of gravity – much more than is comfortable. Without nearing those limits, Waite talks me through how best to tease loops, rolls and stall turns out of this predictable aircraft. It is not as “flickable” as more modern aerobatic aircraft, but for any level of proficiency short of superhuman that is an advantage. A roll rate of 160 degrees a second is fast enough for this mere mortal.The Super Decathlon gives the confidence needed to explore the limits of your ability. “When you’re not afraid of your aeroplane,” says Waite, “you’ll be a safer and better pilot.”Even spins, which I usually find terrifying, are relaxed. Or at least as relaxed as a manoeuvre can be in which the ground is rushing upwards and whirling crazily. After the first one I need to reset my brain’s circuit breakers, but the rest are laughably simple. I even catch myself chuckling at the ease of recovery with the standard technique of rudder into the spin and stick forward to break the stall. After a few they do leave me feeling a bit queasy, though.That queasiness is exacerbated when Waite shows me part of his rather spirited, and extremely proficient, aerobatic routine. Like car-sickness, air-sickness is more easily prompted when someone else has the controls. And when that someone is doing 3g entries to loops, flying inverted and stalling the aircraft while pointing vertically up, I think I do well not to feel more than a trifle peculiar.Coming back to Earls Colne, the drag of the airframe helps slow it down despite the lack of flaps. My landing is tidy enough, and uses only a small part of the grass runway. With practice, operating out of a grass strip of not much more than 500ft at the end of one’s garden should be possible.Later, Waite and I go up again from Manston in Kent to shoot some pictures. Broadstairs, Margate and the Thames estuary are all but ignored as we turn tightly and weave nimbly through the sky.But you don’t need to fly like this all the time. Rather like not using all the performance of your top-of-the-range, 185mph sports bike on every trip to the shops, you can use the Super Decathlon for sunny-evening bumbling around the sky. And when you want to get serious, you can string together a bunch of aerobatic manoeuvres. Or at least as many as your stomach can stand.……………………………………………..The detailsAmerican Champion Aircraft Super DecathlonHow much: Imported and certified in the UK, $200,000 to $220,000 with VAT, depending on options. www.blueyonderaviation.co.ukHow fast: Never-exceed speed 174kt.

Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch triggered a slide in banking stocks after the brokerage slumped to a $9.8bn quarterly loss.The S&P 500 fell 2.9 per cent to 1,333.25, hitting its lowest level since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 307 points, to close 2.5 per cent lower at 12,159.21.The Nasdaq Composite fell 2 per cent to 2,346.90 leaving the tech index 17.9 per cent below its October peak, on the verge of a bear market. Small cap stocks have already passed that marker, with the Russell 2000 now 20.5 per cent from its peak last July, after posting decline of 2.8 per cent to 680.57 on Thursday.The CBOE Vix index - Wall Street’s so-called fear barometer - shot up 16.6 per cent to 28.42, its highest since the end of November.Stocks went into a spin after the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s regional manufacturing index contracted sharply. The report added to concerns that US manufacturers are experiencing a marked slowdown, coming soon after the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index also weakened decisively.“The manufacturing collapse in the Philly index today was a bad number,” Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said. “Pretty much everything about the survey was bad.”Echoing these problems Harley Davidson shed 6.8 per cent to $36.95 after Citigroup told investors to sell the motorcycle manufacturer because it expects US retail sales to decline 10-12 per cent in the fourth-quarter.Traders were not reassured by Ben Bernanke’s Congressional testimony, where he pledged his support for a quickly implemented fiscal stimulus package but cautioned against widening the US budget deficit. His comments came as the White House confirmed that President Bush believes some kind of fiscal boost is necessary but did not provide details.The real-estate sector showed no sign of improving as housing starts fell 14 per cent to 1.006m units last month, the lowest since May 1991. Meanwhile building permits fell 8.1 per cent in December, capping their worst annual decline since 1974.“Housing starts and building permits collapsed,” said TJ Marta, fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “These figures point to a continued contraction in residential investment that will act as a drag on gross domestic product throughout 2008.”Better news on the employment front was quickly forgotten on Thursday amid the gloomy outlook for the US economy. Initial jobless claims fell 21,000 to 301,000, their lowest since September.Corporate news was led by Merrill Lynch, which wrote down $16.7bn of credit assets and fell to a $9.8bn fourth-quarter loss, much worse than analysts had predicted.Merrill’s shares dropped 10.2 per cent to $49.45. The S&P investment banking index slumped 5.4 per cent.Monoline insurers plunged after Moody’s Investors Service put Ambac Financial on watch for possible downgrade.Ambac’s shares slumped 51.9 per cent to $6.24 while MBIA, a rival insurer, fell 31.2 per cent to $9.22Downgrades of bond insurers could have repercussions for the credit markets which depend on their triple-A ratings to guarantee bonds of less credit-worthy companies.Commodity producers continued in free-fall after UBS initiated coverage of Monsanto with a neutral rating and said the agribusiness could miss expectations for the second quarter. The shares fell 11.6 per cent to $99.61.Fertilizer producers were also heavily sold after an analyst at Morgan Stanley raised concerns about potash inventories. Mosaic, lost 11.7 per cent to $81 and Potash fell 10.7 per cent to $120.24.Thursday’s falls leave the S&P down 9.2 per cent for the 2008 while the Dow has given up 8.3 per cent and the Nasdaq 11.5 per cent. The speed of these falls has surprised some analysts who believe the Fed may yet step in to cut interest rates, ahead of its late January meeting.“I do think people - even bears - are getting a little hesitant here by the speed in which this has come down, and therefore how aggressive the Fed might be,” Mr Paulsen said.
115;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2007-12-18T04:00:59Z;Dealmaking does little to dispel gloom;;A spate of deal-making failed to dispel the gloom on Wall Street on Monday as fears of an economic slowdown and rising prices sapped confidence from investors.The US Federal Reserve began a $20bn term loan auction in an attempt to ease liquidity bottlenecks in financial markets, but stocks extended last week’s losses amid concerns it may not be enough to end the credit squeeze.The S&P 500 closed 1.5 per cent lower at 1,445.91 points, for a fall of 4.6 per cent in the past week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 13,167.20. The Nasdaq Composite index declined 2.3 per cent to 2,574.46, a three-week low, after Internet and software stocks felt heavy selling pressure. Baidu.com, the Chinese search engine, fell 9.4 per cent to $356.Roger Volz, chief technical strategist at Swiss American Securities, said that as the end of the year approached hedge funds were “looking to push the button and lock in profits”.Shares in energy and mining groups fell after commodity prices waned but transport stocks outperformed as crude oil prices slipped. “We have been in a trading range market for five months – a tug of war between ‘recession’ and ‘no recession’,” Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards, said.Mergers and acquisitions returned to the agenda, led by Ingersoll-Rand, the diversified manufacturer, which agreed to acquire Trane, the heating and air conditioning systems company in a deal valued at $10.1bn. Ingersoll’s shares fell 11.4 per cent to $43.60 and Trane’s stock soared 21.6 per cent to $45.24.National Oilwell Varco agreed to buy Grant Prideco, the drill pipe supplier, for about $7.4bn in cash and stock. Grant’s shares rose 13.6 per cent to $53.91 but its buyer fell 8.6 per cent to $70.69.Bristol-Myers Squibb, down 1 per cent at $27.81, said it would sell a medical imaging unit to Avista Capital Partners, a private equity group, while Plains Exploration & Production, up 1.6 per cent at $55.17, said it would sell some oil and gas properties for $1.75bn.Loews, the US conglomerate, approved a spin-off of its interest in Lorillard, owner of the Newport and Kent brands, to form a separate publicly traded company.Loews’ shares rose 2.4 per cent to $47.94.A slowdown in merger and acquisition activity, particularly in private equity, has helped to depress the share prices of smaller companies by slashing takeover premiums. The Russell 2000 small-cap index, down 2 per cent at 745.11, has fallen 6.2 per cent this year.Although buyout firms have been hit by the tightening in credit markets, many companies remain flush with cash, as the popularity of share buybacks illustrates.Shares in Harley Davidson rose 1.5 per cent to $45.62, after the motorcycle group approved the repurchase of up to 20m shares.Investors were keeping an eye on the leading investment banks amid fears of further writedowns.Goldman Sachs, down 1 per cent at $208.63, reports quarterly results on Tuesday while Morgan Stanley, down 1.5 per cent at $49.53, releases fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow with Bear Stearns, 1.3 per cent weaker at $94.07, set to follow on Thursday.Citigroup on Monday downgraded a range of consumer finance companies, including Capital One Financial, the credit card provider. The shares fell 3.3 per cent to $45.66.“We expect consumer lenders/insurers to face further credit challenges as home prices decline 3 per cent to 5 per cent in each of the next two years, mortgage rates reset and the macro-economy slows,” said Bradley Ball, a Citi analyst.Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, rebounded 16.9 per cent to $26.66 after Moody’s affirmed its AAA rating.In the industrial sector, Caterpillar fell 3 per cent to $71.16 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the heavy equipment maker. llinois Tool Works, a diversified manufacturer, fell 6.1 per cent to $52.49 after it lowered its fourth quarter earnings guidance.Mr Volz said markets could expect further big price moves prior to Friday’s so-called quadruple witching, the quarterly expiration of contracts for stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures: “It bodes for a lot more volatility than normal.”
116;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2007-11-30T16:14:40Z;Easy rider goes down a storm;;"Could this be the holy grail of modern motorcycling? The one bike that you can do everything on? Tour sedately across continents with a pillion; ride twisty roads with verve; zoom around race circuit curves with your knee skimming the road?Triumph has pulled a storming bike out of the bag with its 675cc Street Triple. It looks like a downsized version of the attitude-filled 1050cc Speed Triple but is better described as a Daytona 675 sports bike that has dispensed with the fairing and other plastic.The Speed Triple is top of the class of civilised hooligan bikes – or hooliganised civilised bikes? – that draw for their styling on the machines used by stunt riders such as Kevin Carmichael, who can wheelie and stoppie a bike for miles before breakfast, and the stripped-down machines known as streetfighters. Improvement by reducing, removing and minimising has a noble tradition among motorcyclists – from full-dress Harley-Davidson touring bikes becoming choppers as far back as the 1950s to today’s customising movement, which once lurked in the fringes, spawning the “naked” bikes that every motorcycle manufacturer now includes in their model line-up.However, Triumph was ahead of the game – the Street Triple was conceived alongside the tiny and outstandingly good Daytona 675 fully faired sports bike, launched two years ago. The naked Speed Triple has a slightly detuned engine, giving it a fatter torque curve for better real-world useability, and twin bug-eye headlamps instead of the Daytona’s bodywork-mounted ones. Triumph talks of the Street Triple sharing the DNA of its 1050cc sibling – an idea scoffed at by my partner, the professor, who is a geneticist – but the bug-eyes ape the Speed Triple’s style, as do the sharply cut-off rear end and the stubby high-level exhausts.The Street Triple swaps the Dayton 675’s racing crouch for a more upright position that makes it easier to ride – the only exceptions are riding fast on motorways, where the wind-blast makes you wish for lower bars, and track riding, where a tucked-in position would allow you to cut through the air more cleanly. But the Street Triple scores on the public highway, whether in town or on winding trunk routes.At the bike’s launch at Lake Garda in Italy, the twistiest of mountain roads could be dispatched with ease. One stretch of road, also used as a race track, allowed me to use its handling almost to the full – keeping a bit in reserve for the unexpected, such as trucks on the racing line.The weight and balance make this bike unintimidating, unlike a number of models whose market is limited immediately by their seat height. BMW’s off-road pantechnicon, the R1200GS Adventure, is a case in point. A handful even for skilled Long Way Round riders Charley Boorman and Ewan McGregor, the bike is literally out of reach for those short of leg. A similar issue with Triumph’s otherwise excellent Tiger limits its riders (mostly) to men.No such problem with the Street Triple: being able to look down at the ground without experiencing a skydiver’s adrenaline rush is a great boost to confidence for newer riders as well as shorter ones. Other features that boost the rider’s confidence are powerful brakes with predictable stopping power. The Street Triple also offers great reassurance at corners – some bikes after a bend seem to wag their finger and reproach you: “Not so fast next time.” This machine says: “You could have gone faster but that’s OK – I’m ready when you are.”If you do want greater speeds, adrenalin rush is never far away. The broad spread of torque means almost any section of road can be ridden in at least two or three gears: a high one for looking at the scenery, a low one for putting your head down and chasing the road’s vanishing point.All this could solve a big problem for me. Replacing my five bikes – each for different moods – with just one would mean I won’t have to rip out my kitchen and replace it with a garage.rohit.jaggi@ft.com……………………………………….Honda’s Hornet carries enough of a stingNoise is central to the motorbike experience: one that is too quiet – like Honda’s gargantuan tourer the Gold Wing – starts to lose some of that essential rawness.The stubby silencer of Honda’s latest contender in the “naked” middleweight class, the CB600F Hornet, leaves a sound that is almost embarrassingly loud in quiet night-time villages and city streets. The bang-up-to-date sportsbike engine adds a touch of the supercharger-like whine that makes the KTM 990 Super Duke, another outstanding naked bike, aural sex on wheels.You need to rev the motor to make the Hornet perform as well the chassis keeps telling you it can handle. So, with just a tweak of the right wrist, you go from acceptable, throaty, busy burble to yowling mechanical frenzy.The chassis tells no lies. Reassuring and stable, it is as easy to ride fast as it is to ride slow. It is slightly cramped two-up, but the professor, my partner, found it possible to avoid headbutting me with her helmet too often.For extra reassurance, the Hornet can come with anti-lock brakes – ABS systems, now almost universal in the car world, are fast spreading from four wheels to two. The Hornet’s linked, anti-lock brakes are a touch lacking in feel, but are amply powerful.Its irritations are confined to a foot-rest that always snared my trouser leg when putting down the stand, and a crevice on the other side that frequently trapped a flailing bootlace, giving a few moments when I tried and failed to put down my right foot. But the balance of the bike was such that I could switch to extending the other foot with no problem.In my book the Hornet loses to the Street Triple only because it is too noisy. But if ABS and Honda’s legendary reliability are important, then the Hornet carries enough of a sting for all types of riding.Price £5,299

117;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2007-09-07T15:20:48Z;Second chance at love;;The sparkling-clean palace of cutting-edge technological innovation that is the Williams Formula One team headquarters, near Oxford in central England, would seem, at first blush, to be a curious match with Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The US bikemaker’s traditional image has more in common with the admittedly magnificent but decidedly low-tech topiary version of a Formula One car in the grounds than with the carbon-fibre and titanium confections that Williams produces for the racetrack. Yet this was the venue Harley chose for the UK launch of the latest version of its venerable Sportster family of 883cc and 1200cc motorcycles.Harley has made sizeable profits by harking back to its past, mimicking it, rehashing it, replicating it and just plain continuing it in its range of motorcycles. To the untutored eye, they can easily look very much like all the other two-wheelers that Harley has made since about 1970.It was about then that I first fell in love with Harleys. These simple machines championed design through function at a time when American carmakers had espoused form to the exclusion of dynamic abilities.But after years of teenage and older lusting, when I first threw my leg over a Sportster in the early 1990s the bike was a horrible, dismal disappointment. It was slow, it rattled, it handled appallingly and the brakes refused to do any more than hint at stopping ability.Thankfully, the Sportster has improved mechanically and become much more user-friendly over the years. The Nightster, the latest of the breed, has also been given the stripped-back-to-basics style that first attracted me. The tiny but exquisitely shaped petrol tank, the shortened rear fender and the black wheels indicate a minimalist approach.The only thing letting the bike down is slightly absurd front fork gaiters. The coarse pleats of the front suspension covers look more like flexible rubber hoses from a truck than the elegant items sported by British bikes of the 1960s and 1970s that they are meant to mimic.Heading out of the Williams headquarters and on to the busy main roads around Oxford, the Nightster was a smooth revelation. The narrow-angle V-twin engine gives Harleys their distinctive exhaust tone – described as making a sound like “potato potato” when the factory tried to patent the noise – but it also gives a lumpy power delivery. Electronic fuel injection has smoothed that out, as has the belt drive that Harley brought back into fashion. The gearbox is just as smooth, even though it will never be as slick as those in a Japanese sports bike, and the brakes take a bit of a squeeze at the lever but are effective.Such is the smoothness and power that the Nightster encouraged me to tweak the throttle in a very un-Harley way, egging me on to overtaking everything in front of me. The suspension complements such antics by making no false promise of excellence but still providing a plush ride and good handling for a cruiser.The Nightster feels like a small bike and not just in comparison with the leviathans that form the Big Twin range. With a low seat height, a subterranean centre of gravity and a nipped-in waist, its unintimidating mien makes it no surprise that Sportsters are the most common entry points to the Harley dream for owners new to bikes.The downside is that I had to ride with my knees hanging out in the wind. The fuel tank looks gorgeous but is too narrow to grip for legs forced apart by the width of the engine, which made cornering less involving than if I had felt part of – rather than perched on – the bike.Whatever the performance, though, the bike’s styling is the most important part of its appeal.Harleys’ names are another integral part of the image, cultivated as carefully as the Williams gardeners tend that racecar-shaped shrub. The name Sportster has always been something of a misnomer, though – the forthcoming XR 1200 will be the first of the line to be truly worthy of the name. Where Harley has driven home its advantage is in the bad-ass image – and Nightster is a perfect fit there.In a world where bad means good, a motorcycle that does not lean over very far or go very fast yet is called a Sportster, has found its place.‘Change everything and nothing‘Harley-Davidson has one eye firmly fixed on existing customers who want to buy a traditional, honest, American iron horse, but another is on new customers who want the rideability they have become used to with other brands. Along with ever-tightening emission and noise legislation, the bikemaker is being forced to put more technology into its ostensibly low-tech-and-proud-of-it products.So a fly-by-wire throttle control, as fitted to its big-twin Tourer range for next year, is right up there with the technological leaders in the closely fought Japanese supersports 600cc race replica class. An added benefit is that it tidies up the look of the right handlebar of bikes such as the Road King Classic, the long, low and traditional tourer, with a simple but effective windscreen and giant leather panniers.Much-improved brakes with ABS are also standard on the Road King Classic and other big tourers. The anti-lock system is rather crude so that, at an initial sharp application of the brakes, the system disconcerted me by bleeding off the pressure for a moment. That left me going faster than I expected but I could get used to that. The safety advantages and reassurance are invaluable on a bike I would need an army of helpers to lift if I dropped it.Hidden improvements such as these fit in with the Harley philosophy of “change everything and change nothing”. And while the bikemaker’s constraint is its conservative buyers, perhaps that is not too dissimilar to the rules that stop Williams unleashing all the technology it could on its Formula One cars.The test rideSay hello to: A lean, mean, and actually reasonably muscled machine.Engine: 1200cc Evolution V-twin, air-cooled and with electronic fuel injection.

118;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2007-07-19T21:24:52Z;S&P 500, Dow close at all-time high;;Wall Street rallied on Thursday as positive sentiment in the technology sector helped investors shrug off fresh worries about the hard-hit US subprime mortgage market.The bullish mood propelled the S&P 500 to a record close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average settled above 14,000 for the first time.Ben Bernanke, the US Federal Reserve chairman, told US lawmakers that losses from the subprime mortgage market could range between $50bn and $100bn.Leading the major benchmarks was the Nasdaq Composite, with a gain of 0.8 per cent to 2,720.04. One boost for the tech sector was a 12.5 per cent surge to $30.06 in Juniper Networks shares after the networking equipment maker swung to a second-quarter profit. Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral”, in the expectation that strong sales growth would boost operating margins.Cisco rose 1.7 per cent to $29.94 and had set a 52-week high of $30.So far this year, the Nasdaq’s gain of 12.6 per cent has outpaced the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the Nasdaq 100 has rallied 16.8 per cent. In a bull market, the more volatile technology stocks led the way as they enable investors to reap higher returns.“It’s no surprise that high beta stocks are doing well in this current rally,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. “People who have missed some of the rally, and are forced to chase returns, can get back in the race by buying high beta names.”Another factor in favour of the tech sector is that international sales form a larger proportion of total sales, say analysts. A faster growing global economy in conjunction with a sharply weaker dollar is a fillip for the sector and multinational blue chip companies.But a sour note for techs was struck by Ebay, which fell 1.6 per cent to $33.50, after the online auctioneer posted a 50 per cent rise in quarterly profit, but left its outlook for 2007 unchanged. Investors had hoped for a rise in guidance and also focused on lower global listings.After the closing bell Google reported a 28 per cent rise in second quarter profits that missed estimates as higher costs eroded better-than-expected revenue growth. Google slumped more than 6 per cent in post-market trade.Also after the close, Microsoft met earnings estimates and raised guidance. Microsoft initially rallied in after-hours action, following a gain of 1.9 per cent to $31.51 in regular trade.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices reported a loss in the second quarter as a rise in sales for the chip maker was offset by lower microprocessor prices and costs associated with the $5.6bn purchase of ATI Technologies, a graphics chip maker. In after-hours trade, the stock rallied further after a rise of 2.1 per cent to $15.87 at the closing bell.The enthusiasm for tech stocks lifted the broad market into record territory. The S&P rose 0.45 per cent to 1,553.07 a new record high. Among the major sectors, utilities, technology and energy led gains, while health care and financials declined.Among the financials, Bank of America said quarterly earnings rose 5 per cent with an increase in the provision for credit losses. BofA has now set aside $1.81bn to cover these losses, up from $1.01bn in the second quarter of 2006. Shares in BofA fell 0.2 per cent to $49.27.PNC Financial, a mid-Atlantic regional bank, said quarterly earnings expanded 11 per cent and was also buying Sterling Financial for $565m, or $19 per share. The stock slipped 2.5 per cent to $71.37.Shares in MF Global fell on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. MF closed at $27.55, after the financial firm had listed at $30 a share – lower than the expected range of $36 to $39, traders said.The American Stock Exchange Broker-Dealer index fell 0.75 per cent.Another financial stock in the news was American Home Mortgage Investment. The stock plunged 20.8 per cent to $10.76 as subprime worries among investors intensified and the company did not comment on the sharp decline.Blue chips rallied, led by IBM, and the DJIA rose 0.6 per cent to close at 14,000.41.In earnings news, IBM reported a 12 per cent rise in second quarter profit, and raised earnings guidance for 2007. The stock gained 4.3 per cent to $115.86 and had set a new five-year high of $116.48.Another Dow stock, Honeywell, posted a 24 per cent rise in quarterly profits, beating estimates. The stock rose 0.7 per cent to $60.98 and also reached a seven-year high of $61.90 earlier in the day. The company raised guidance for 2007 and also authorised the buyback of an additional $3bn in stock.Shares in Foot Locker surged 8.6 per cent to $22.71, after the company said it would consider putting itself up for sale. The shoe retailer recently failed to buy rival Genesco.In other earnings, Motorola recorded a quarterly loss amid lower revenue from weak phone sales. Shares rose 1.2 per cent to $18.22.Union Pacific reported a 14 per cent rise in quarterly profits. The railroad slid 0.1 per cent to $125.74.Hershey reported a 96 per cent drop in profits for the past quarter, as the confectionary maker invested in transforming its production lines. Its shares fell 3 per cent to $48.45.Harley Davidson reported a 19 per cent rise in profit and reaffirmed guidance for 2007. But domestic sales of motorcycles fell and the stock slid 2.9 per cent to $59.37.Investors will focus on earnings from two DJIA stocks, Citigroup and Caterpillar on Friday. Citi fell 0.9 per cent to $51.14, while Cat rose 0.9 per cent to $86.42 on Thursday.In economic news on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed survey reported a drop to 9.2 in July from a reading of 18 in June. The six-month outlook index rose 30.4 in July from a reading of 16.7 in June.Economists at Bear Stearns said: “This is a stronger report than suggested by the headline sentiment index.”Later this afternoon the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting in June are released.Earlier in the day, leading indicators for June fell 0.3 per cent, more than a forecast decline of 0.1 per cent.“Housing continues to weigh, a theme that ties in with the concerns Bernanke stated yesterday [Wednesday],” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “However, despite the decline, the trend in the overall index appears to have stabilised after declining early 2006 to a cyclical low in early 2007.”Stocks closed lower on Wednesday, but did pare the worst of their earlier losses.
119;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2007-07-19T21:21:27Z;Overseas orders rev up Harley sales;;Surging international demand helped Harley-Davidson offset a slump in the US market to report a 19.3 per cent rise in second quarter earnings.The Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker blamed a 5.5 per cent drop in US dealer sales on high fuel prices, rising interest rates and a fall-off in consumer confidence. The heavy bike market is experiencing its most severe contraction since the early 1990s.Harley acknowledged that, in a move reminiscent of carmakers, some dealers had offered discounts to move unsold inventory of 2007 models. Credit losses have also grown.On the other hand, Jim Ziemer, chief executive, said that “the appetite for our product has been almost insatiable in some international markets”. Sales outside the US jumped by 13.7 per cent in the second quarter, including increases in every big European country.Net second-quarter earnings climbed to $290.5m, or $1.14 a share, from $243.4m, or 91 cents, a year earlier. Revenues grew by 17.7 per cent to $1.62bn.Mr Ziemer forecast that Harley’s 2008 models, introduced last week, would boost US sales in the second half.Harley shares dipped by more than 4 per cent to $58.46 in early trading on Thursday.
120;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2007-06-25T20:28:30Z;Wall St down on subprime worries;;US stocks lost ground in late trade on Monday, as worries over the US financial sector’s exposure to the troubled mortgage market sapped sentiment.Stocks in the materials, energy and financial sectors led losses, while utilities were one of the few standouts. The rate sensitive sector was buoyed by lower bond yields, as concern over the mortgage market lingered.Meanwhile, a 0.3 per cent fall in existing home sales for May pulled real estate and home builder stocks lower on Monday.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,497.75 after rising to 1,514.29 earlier in the day. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,577.08 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to close at 13,352.05, after setting a high of 13,488.77 in early trade.The renewed selling in stocks pushed equity volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, to close near its high on Monday. In late trade, the Vix was up 6.9 per cent at 16.83, after a dip to 15.41 when stocks were in positive territory.Among financial stocks, Bear Stearns led losses with a fall of 3.2 per cent to $139.10. The bank remained in the spotlight after it pumped $3.2bn into one of its troubled mortgage hedge funds. In turn, analysts remain worried that woes could spread. Goldman Sachs lost 2.5 per cent to close at $216.74 and Lehman Brothers fell 2.1 per cent to $75.05.“Hedge fund losses, possible tax law changes and sub-prime mortgage write-downs bedevil equity markets,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. “Prior worries about higher oil prices and rising Treasury bond yields dissipate as the root of investment community unease.”This week marks month and quarter end, and leveraged investors may well value their mortgage positions at current prices and thus possibly reveal sharp losses in their portfolios.“We don’t think there are other funds like Bear Stearns Asset Management, although there may be a number of smaller funds that may face similar financing issues,” said Dominic Konstam, head of interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse.Another feature of the last week in June is that some portfolio managers may alter their holdings by selling poor performing stocks and buying those that have done well over the past three months.“Over the last four years, we have found that the stocks which tend to perform best up until the last week of the quarter have outperformed the market during the last week,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.Heading into July, investors are also likely to focus on second quarter earnings, which are currently forecast to grow about 4.5 per cent. Still, at the start of April analysts forecast first quarter earnings would expand at less than 4 per cent, only for actual profits to rise around 9 per cent.“Consensus earnings growth expectations for the S&P 500 appears low, similar to the trend seen late in the first quarter, arguably providing the fodder for a turnaround in stock prices as was the case in April and May,” said Mr Levkovich.Beyond financials, a broker upgrade for General Motors, from Goldman Sachs boosted the car maker by 2.3 per cent to $36.27. Goldman Sachs said shares could rise further should GM’s discussions with labour unions end on a positive note for carmakers seeking to control legacy medical and retirement costs.A broker upgrade for Omnicom boosted shares in the advertising company by 2.2 per cent to $103.97.Meanwhile, Walgreens. the pharmacy retailer, fell 1.6 per cent to $44.25, after it reported a 20 per cent rise in its third-quarter profit.Google, set a new record high of $534.99, before the stock closed up 0.5 per cent at $527.42 on Monday.Shares in Harley-Davidson were 3.1 per cent lower at $60.64, after Honda denied it is looking to buy the motor-cycle maker. The stock surged 4 per cent last Friday, amid hefty options trading.Blackstone lost 7.5 per cent to close at $32.44, after last week’s debut for the first private equity firm to list on an exchange.Investors awaited news of whether the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones, can strike an editorial independence pact with Rupert Murdoch and facilitate News Corp’s $5bn bid for the company. Dow Jones fell 2.2 per cent to $57.50, while NewsCorp rose 0.8 per cent to $23.50.
121;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Mangoes symbol of India-US trade;;In a symbolic move to boost low levels of Indo-US bilateral trade, the first batch of Indian mangoes are due to arrive in the US this weekend, ending a 17-year old trade dispute between the two countries.After months of negotiations, the US has agreed to import Indian mangoes for the first time after clearing concerns about insect importation.In exchange for mangoes, India is considering relaxing restrictions to allow the import of the Harley-Davidson motorcycles, currently barred from India because of emissions standards and high taxes.This mango-for-motorcycles diplomacy reflects efforts to double bilateral trade between India and the US within the next three years from about $30bn currently. By comparison, trade between the US and China amounts to about $350bn.David Mulford, US ambassador to India, said in a statement that the move was part of a pledge to “open US markets to Indian mangoes, an important national symbol in India. Bringing Indian mangoes to the United States is just one step in increasing agricultural trade between the US and India”.India is the world’s largest producer of mangoes but exports remain low. Japan last year allowed imports of Indian mangoes for the first time. The demand for mangoes in the US is strong, with an estimated market of 250,000 tonnes.As part of the agreement the Indian mangoes will be irradiated before entering the US, according to guidelines from the US Department of Agriculture.“The possibility of mango export to the US assumes commercial as well as symbolic significance, as access to the global marketplace will benefit Indian farmers and consumers, together with their American counterparts,” said Ron Somers, president of the US India Business Council, an industry group that led the lobbying for mango imports.The first shipment of 150 boxes of Alphonso and Kessar mangoes were flown from Mumbai to Boston early Friday. The first batch of mangoes come primarily from orchards in the western states of Gujarat and Maharashtra.The leading exporter of mangoes to the US is Mexico followed by Central American countries.The mangoes will be irradiated at certified facilities before entering the US. Each shipment must be accompanied by certificates issued by India declaring inspection and where the mangoes were grown. The fruit will be subject to inspection at the port of first arrival. To whet US appetite for mangoes, the US India Business Council will hold a mango-tasting festival at its global India summit in Washington this June.
122;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2007-02-04T19:29:46Z;Harley-Davidson;;Being a frequent subject of business school case studies is a bit like riding a motorcycle. It is pleasant – as long as you don’t let the thrill of the ride distract you from the dangers ahead.Take Harley-Davidson. On Friday, workers at the motorcycle maker’s largest assembly plant went on strike for the first time in 16 years. Its shares actually went up on the news despite dark mutterings from Harley that it could end up in the same position as Detroit’s car industry if it does not get its way.Such warnings sound premature with profits running at record levels. But they are a reminder of how unusual Harley’s return from the brink has been – and what it might risk if no quick settlement is reached.Harley once had a virtual monopoly in the US but was hit even worse by Japanese competition than Detroit’s big three. Its revival was based on positioning its bikes as a lifestyle choice with no real substitutes – and on copying the best of its Japanese rivals’ management techniques to ensure its products lived up to their billing. Chief among these was a collaborative approach towards employees in order to get continuous quality and efficiency improvements.That served Harley well. Shipments have risen fivefold over the past 15 years. But despite recent successes overseas, Harley’s size makes slower growth and some margin pressure likely. To avoid turning today’s pay negotiations into tomorrow’s legacy costs, the company is right to push for stingier healthcare benefits and tweaking the terms of new employees.Pairing that with subdued wage increases, however, was bound to cause unrest at a company that prides itself on treating all stakeholders well. Harley and its dealers have plenty of inventory to sit out a short strike. But it should remember that collaborative labour relations are easier to destroy than to build. Just look at Detroit.

The company also reported an 8.4 per cent rise in system-wide sales, better than the 7 per cent gain in revenue forecast by analysts. Its shares rose 2.38 per cent, or 98 cents, to $42.23.PepsiCo said third quarter profit rose nearly 71 per cent, helped by strength in its international business, non-carbonated drinks and salty snacks. The beverage and snacks company also lifted its forecast for the year. In spite of this, PepsiCo shares fell 1.58 per cent to $62.85.The S&P 500 closed up 0.95 per cent, or 12.87 points, at 1,362.82. The Nasdaq composite was up 1.64 per cent, or 371.91 points, at 2,346.18 at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a new record high of 11,948.26, up 0.81 per cent or 96.13 points for the day, the first time it has closed above the 11,900 barrier.The US trade gap rose to a record level in August. US imports outstripped exports by $69.9bn in August, according to the commerce department, up from the previous record of $68bn set in July.Alfred Goldman, of AG Edwards, said the upward movement of stocks was in spite of certain factors that may have been expected to have more of a negative impact recently. “This market has been ignoring several good excuses to go lower , such as North Korea’s nuclear test,” he said.He added that the Dow was up 10 per cent in the past two and half months, saying the market should be careful of going too far too fast.Early on Thursday, wholesale retailer Costco reported better-than-expected results and said it did not expect to restate results following a review of its stock option programme. Costco shares rose 7.65 per cent, or $3.83, to $53.90.Harley Davidson, the motorcycle maker, said its earnings climbed 18 per cent in the most recent quarter, beating Wall Street forecasts.

125;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2006-08-21T16:56:15Z;PepsiCo’s number cruncher must look beyond the figures;;Comment on this columnLipsmackin’. That was the market’s reaction to the announcement from PepsiCo last week that its current chief financial officer, Indra Nooyi, was to take over as chief executive from Steve Reinemund this October. Having served as CFO for the past five years, helping to steer PepsiCo’s strategic repositioning, Ms Nooyi seems well placed to take on the top job.This appointment ticks so many of the boxes scrutinised exhaustively by politically correct observers – and viewed with suspicion by professional sceptics – that the most important aspect of the news risks being overlooked.Yes, I have noticed: Ms Nooyi is a woman, now one of only 11 female CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. Nor has it escaped my attention that she is Indian, born in what was then Madras (now Chennai). At 50, she is at an age where some senior executives feel the hot breath of age discrimination at the back of their necks.What really matters about Ms Nooyi’s well-received promotion is that she has made the increasingly common move from the finance department to being in charge of the whole show. No longer sidelined as a mere “bean-counter”, the CFO or finance director is often seen as a quasi-deputy chief executive, in at the heart of all the big decisions, exercising a huge influence that reaches beyond the balance sheet. Companies as diverse as Southwest Airlines, International Paper, Harley-Davidson and Halliburton all have their former CFOs in place as CEO. Oracle’s chairman, Jeff Henley, was once its CFO. According to CFO magazine, as of last October almost one-fifth of Fortune 500 companies had a former CFO as CEO.The increased importance of the CFO role reflects the speed, volatility and sheer muscle of the investment community. In spite of ongoing unhappiness in boardrooms about the “tyranny” of quarterly reporting, no executive is under any illusion about the consequences of failing to hit the numbers. When a vacancy arises for a new chief executive, who better, shareholders might feel, than the person who has spent the past few years delivering on those financial targets?CFOs have often developed a sharp awareness of the risk factors that play out in different markets. They have been in the room listening to explanations when things have gone wrong. They are familiar with the sort of complexity global business brings with it today. “You don’t have to have been a CFO to make a good CEO”, the head of one of the UK’s “big four” accountancy firms tells me, “but it helps.”What is the downside here? There is clearly a danger that a former CFO will be tempted down the financial engineering route, too interested in the numbers and insufficiently sensitive to the broader needs of the organisation. Any narrowness of approach will hinder attempts to build lasting and sustainable growth.Mergers, disposals and acquisitions may well form an important part of a corporate strategy, but they are not a substitute for researching and developing new products, or investing in staff (who are, incidentally, people and not depreciating “assets”).But this is the good news about PepsiCo’s new boss. Ms Nooyi is – and this is not in any way meant to sound disrespectful – a bit of a fox. I mean she is a fox and not a hedgehog, according to the definition offered in the seventh century BC by the Greek poet and soldier Archilochus: “The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.”Business leadership today calls for the fox’s agility and breadth of experience rather than the hauteur of the hedgehog. The best CFOs know this. Norman Lyle, until last year group finance director of Jardine Matheson in Hong Kong, explained it once in these terms: “The CFO will have to deal with ambiguity. Things are not black and white. To have sound business judgment means that they need to have a comprehensive understanding of the business they are operating in. They need a deep and broad knowledge. There can be no ivory towers any more. The CFOs have got to get out and talk to people.”This rather chimes with what my father has spent much of the past 30 years trying to tell me: that I should aim to be a “Jack of all trades, and master of one”. (I will save the letters editor some trouble by acknowledging that I clearly have more work to do on both sides of that last comma.)Finance must not become too mighty or too proud. As John Connors, former CFO at Microsoft, put it: “When I hear a strategic plan has come out of the finance function, I know that that is a stock to avoid.” Seeing the face of John Mayo, former finance director of GEC/Marconi, smiling out of a newspaper last week was a reminder that even the most highly regarded financial brains can get things terribly wrong if their grand vision is not tempered with realism and sound judgment.It is also worth pointing out that in 1999 CFO magazine’s “most creative financial officer of the year” award went to Enron’s Andrew Fastow – who was not, incidentally, a certified public accountant, any more than the similarly scandal-hit Ahold’s former CFO Michiel Meurs was.As everyone knows, it takes two men to fill the gap left by one good woman. That is what is happening at PepsiCo, with Indra Nooyi’s former responsibilities being taken up by two male colleagues. Perhaps for once the uniformly positive market reaction is well founded. This is one CFO who knows what the numbers mean, but understands that they can never tell the whole story.Comment on this columnstefan.stern@ft.com

This means that Morgan must also ensure it has a good network of dealers to resell cars.“If Morgan are looking to increase repeat sales they will need to ensure that owners of their vehicles can get a decent residual price.”There are a lot of small-scale sports car manufacturers in the UK, but many run into trouble finding enough capital to keep the business ticking over, according to Mr Cooke.“We have seen TVR go through all sorts of problems. They just were not getting the volumes.”China can be the biggest threat and greatest opportunity for small production-run British sports car manufacturers such as Morgan, according to Rupert Merson, a partner at BDO Stoy Hayward, the business advisers.The sale of MG Rover could mean new competition for Morgan if the new Chinese owners decide to revive classic British car brands such as Austin Healey.“You only need something like that on the street being pumped out with some sophisticated manufacturing behind it for Morgan to be in trouble,” Mr Merson said. On the other hand, Mr Merson believes that China and its neighbours can provide lucrative new export markets for Morgan.“The US is a tired old market. There might be new markets for Morgan in south-east Asia.”Mr Merson also wonders whether Morgan relies too much on meeting safety requirements and not enough on reliability.“Many Morgan drivers might appreciate that they buy a car that can get them from London to Birmingham in one piece rather than one that will get them to the end of the
road but runs the risk of overheating.”He suggests that Morgan consider what Harley Davidson, the iconic US motorcycle manufacturer, did with its business, dramatically improving the reliability of its machines and building the Harley Davidson membership club for customers."

130;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2006-04-12T19:01:22Z;Harley-Davidson stays in gear;;Harley-Davidson quashed investor fears on Wednesday that it would cut production rates, although the iconic motorcycle manufacturer has pushed more shipments into the second half of the year.The US company is seeking to diversify its customer base with increased international marketing and a focus on female riders, but still relies heavily on a male-dominated domestic base that typically buys bikes in the second and third quarters.Jim Ziemer, president and chief executive, said full-year shipments would remain at 348,000-352,000 – a rise of 5.8-7 per cent. The 91,000 bikes planned for the second quarter include 13,000 of its 2007 models, which will not be shipped until the following quarter, the peak period for sales. The company shipped 77,000 bikes in the same period last year and announced a cut in production.The backloading of sales to the second half – when shipments will have to grow by 9-11 per cent to meet targets – unnerved investors, who pushed the shares down 5.5 per cent to $50.07 by midday in New York.Mr Ziemer said the production shift between quarters was “a matter of weeks” and said average selling prices remained above the recommended retail level, as it reported record first-quarter earnings and sales.Net profits rose from $227.2m to $234.6m in the three months to March 31, with rising margins pushing sales up 4 per cent at $1.29bn.Unit retail sales rose 6.9 per cent, with expansion in Europe and Japan pushing international volumes up 11.6 per cent, although non-US sales are usually stronger in the first quarter and attract dealer discounts.

Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP’s chief executive, dismissed Benatti on January 9 in a dispute that has coincided with reports of two break-ins at its Milan offices.Benatti came to London this week to give his version of events to a small group of reporters and he said that following his firing he has been unable to recover some of his own property that is still at the WPP offices. The personal effects left behind include paintings and sculpture. That €22,000 (£15,000) Harley-Davidson motorcycle sitting in the garage for the past six weeks is his too.Finding house price doomsayers has become harder than it once was. But not impossible. Jim Mellon, the financier, not long ago wrote a book called Wake Up!, predicting a global property crash.Over breakfast on Thursday he told Mudlark that he still believed UK house prices would fall by 50 per cent and it was time to get out of the market. Had he sold his own house? Er, no. “I don’t practice what I preach. But I don’t have a mortgage on it.”What about his $1.5bn (£864m) flotation of a new residential property company? That would be different, it being an investor in German homes.“Our forecasts for Germany are much more positive,” Mellon says.Vladimir Romanov, owner of Heart of Midlothian Football Club, intends to apply for a licence to open a British outlet of Ukio Bankas, the Lithuanian

Romanov’s high-handed methods caused Labour peer and former MP George Foulkes to quit as chairman, to be replaced by the owner’s son, Roman.Graham Rix was appointed head coach but has had to defer to the owner in choosing the team.Thursday was national day in Lithuania and everyone was said to be away ski-ing, so Mudlark was unable to establish whether the manager of a Ukio branch in Edinburgh would be allowed to pick his or her own staff.BNP Paribas is sending an Englishman to Paris and a Frenchwoman to New York in a shuffling of the bank’s top communications team to reflect its cultural diversity, now that more than half of the 110,000 employees work outside France.Jonathan Mullen is to become group head of media relations and internal communications, after more than five years as head of corporate communications for the bank in the UK.Mullen, who formerly worked at Salomon Smith Barney, honed his French experience with stints as a trainee at Technip and Rhône-Poulenc as well as working as a press officer for Paribas in Paris before its merger with Banque Nationale de Paris. He replaces Michèle Sicard, who becomes head of corporate communications in North America.Computer spell-checking programs occasionally throw up unintentionally inspired options. The FT’s editorial production system, for example, suggests, as an alternative to Sven-Goran Eriksson, Savant Groin Erections.

132;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2006-01-02T20:29:17Z;Nepal’s kingdom of discontent;;Every time Paras, Nepal’s unpopular crown prince, leaves the royal palace in Kathmandu, he unwittingly pushes the Himalayan kingdom a step closer towards a republican revolution. When his bodyguards menace people in bars, when he blocks traffic in the capital so he can roar around on a Harley-Davidson flanked by gun-toting outriders and when he shows himself to be indifferent to the miseries of a people caught up in a lethal war between security forces and Maoist insurgents, he is an anti-model for the dynastic principle. Nepal is a feudal society but, as the cartoons in the daily papers show, traditional respect for its god-king is crumbling.King Gyanendra, who threw out Nepal’s government and seized absolute power last February, has more urgent concerns than bringing a wayward son and heir to heel. He is facing an unprecedented threat to the throne he inherited from his murdered brother after the royal massacre of 2001. A new alliance between Maoist fighters and a coalition of seven political parties has left the palace isolated.On November 17, the Maoists and the parties, after meeting in New Delhi, announced they had agreed on a 12-point “understanding”. It called for a conference of democratic forces that would form an interim government, followed by elections to a constituent assembly. What role, if any, would be left for the king is vague. By bringing the Maoists into the mainstream, the alliance damaged the king’s legitimacy, proving that where his autocratic repression had failed, multi-party politics could succeed.The agreement marked the moment at which the Maoists prepared to trade their gains on the ground for a negotiating position in the design of a new constitution. The rebels launched their uprising against a “feudal” monarchy in the name of oppressed castes, women, indigenous tribes and other disadvantaged groups in 1996. Since then, at least 12,000 people have been killed, mostly villagers. The Maoists now control more than 75 per cent of the countryside and have established their own rule in many areas, leaving the royal writ to run only in the Kathmandu valley and provincial capitals.“In the popular imagination, we’re already living in a post-monarchical situation,” says Hari Sharma, director of Social Science Baha, a think-tank in Kathmandu. Nepal has not yet reached that “moment of madness” that would enable it to sweep away the monarchy, he says, but such an event is no longer inconceivable. “The popular press no longer venerates the king and he has not realised the significance of the radicalisation of the popular imagination. Nor has he understood that the parties have tremendously radicalised their agendas too because they want to address the fundamental issues raised by the Maoists.”In the coming days, parties and Maoists plan a final push to force the king to cede power and restore democracy. The crunch may come soon. Pro-democracy protesters are threatening to disrupt municipal elections that the king has called for February 8. Political parties that represent around 90 per cent of those elected to the last parliament are boycotting the polls, which they claim are a transparent attempt by the king to legitimise his power-grab. The Maoists, who yesterday ended the unilateral ceasefire they had declared on September 2 but renewed their commitment to the 12-point agreement with the parties, have vowed not to let the elections take place. The Royal Nepalese Army (RNA), loyal to the king, is looking nervous.“Our desire is to have a republic in Nepal, but that depends on our ability to mobilise the people and create a tsunami that sweeps away the monarchy,” said Madhav K. Nepal, leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), one of the political parties that agreed the joint programme with the Maoists.Other parties in the alliance, which spans a broad range of opinion, are more cautious, however, and the agreement itself nowhere mentions the word “republic”, preferring the deliberately ambiguous phrase “absolute democracy” that leaves scope for a constitutional monarchy. The Maoists are resolute in their calls for a republic but it is thought they may settle for a purely ceremonial role for the king if other core demands – such as land reform – are met.The parties believe that with the Maoists, who have in the past killed their local workers, now on their side and permitting their activities in rural areas, they can capture the peace ticket and bring unprecedented numbers out on the streets in pro-democracy demonstrations. In the best case, they hope this pressure will force the king to open negotiations with constitutional forces, ending a period in which he has marginalised the parties and recreated a medieval-style absolute monarchy modelled on the rule of King Mahendra, his father. In the worst case, they fear he will ruthlessly deploy the RNA against his own people. ,“The people are rising up slowly, slowly, and it looks like this is a grand finale,” says Kailash Sirohiya, managing director of Kantipur Publications, publisher of the Kathmandu Post, a leading English-language newspaper, and owner of an FM radio station whose transmission equipment was recently confiscated. “The November 17 agreement has made people believe the parties will be strong enough to do whatever they want and that the king’s options are shrinking. The Maoists are ready to join the mainstream if there is a commitment to complete democracy, with the king accepting a purely ceremonial role. But he is not interested in a purely ceremonial role. I’m afraid as to what will happen once the truce ends. There will be big, big bloodshed when they try to disrupt the elections.”What happens next in this mountainous Hindu kingdom has a geo-strategic importance that extends far beyond the Kathmandu valley. India and China, the two giants that lie on its southern and northern borders, both have significant interests in Nepal. While no one expects that Nepal will lead to another conflict between the two emerging economic giants of Asia, who briefly went to war over a border dispute in 1962, there is certainly the potential for it to become a very real source of friction.For New Delhi, the key issue in Nepal is water but there are many others. As the lower riparian country, India has a strategic interest in ensuring the stability of the Himalayan sources of some of the subcontinent’s most vital rivers, among them the Ganges. Chronically short of energy, India also has a keen interest in developing Nepal’s underexploited potential to generate and export hydro-power. A third worry, of particular concern to the Indian government’s Communist coalition partners, is that a Maoist victory in Nepal would be a shot in the arm for Naxalite and other hard-left movements that are gaining ground in poor states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.Beijing has a different set of concerns, principally related to worries that instability in Nepal would threaten China’s grip on Tibet. Just as a Maoist victory would encourage Naxalism in India, China fears that Nepal could become the base for anti-Chinese radicalism in Tibet and boost pro-democracy forces in Lhasa. Such activity, it worries, could be fomented by India or the US, whose Central Intelligence Agency is believed to have played an important part in backing a Tibetan resistance movement in the late 1950s and early 1960s that operated out of Mustang, a remote area of Nepal that juts into Tibet. Such concern has led Beijing to look sympathetically at the king as a bulwark against instability and pro-democracy forces.King Gyanendra has skilfully played India and China off against each other, reviving a cold war tactic his father used to great effect in the 1960s. Days before the February putsch, for example, King Gyanendra curried favour with Beijing by shutting the Dalai Lama’s cultural office in Kathmandu. In doing so, he has successfully divided the international community. Whereas India, the US and UK have tried to put pressure on the king to restore democracy by cutting off supplies of lethal weapons to the RNA since February, China has made no such commitment. Indeed, it has actually undermined this international effort, much to Indian, US and UK irritation, by recently supplying 18 truckloads of arms and ammunition.“Frankly, if this place deteriorates dramatically it’s going to affect Chinese interests pretty heavily,” says James Moriarty, the US ambassador in Nepal. “If we have a Maoist state here exporting revolution, everyone in the neighbourhood is going to face difficult decisions.”For King Gyanendra, the decision to play his “China card” is a last-ditch and desperate attempt to exploit divisions within India over the wisdom of squeezing the king militarily to get him to restore democracy. The Indian government is under pressure from its military security advisers to ease up on the king and help their fellow officers in the RNA, many of whom will have trained in India, in the fight against the Maoists. India and Nepal, they point out, share a 1,750km porous border. At the same time, cultural ties between the palace and India’s princely aristocracy and the support of Hindu nationalist groups for a monarch claiming direct descent from Vishnu make New Delhi sensitive to the criticism that it is leaving the door open to creeping Chinese influence.“Many in India still remember the 1962 ‘stab in the back’,” says Kundar Dixit, editor of the Nepali Times, a weekly newspaper, referring to China’s invasion of India. “Nepal played China and India off against each other, getting aid from each and letting the Chinese build highways right down to the Indian border. The king uses that fear to tweak India and it works brilliantly.”For the moment, as Keith Bloomfield, the UK ambassador to Nepal, puts it, there is still support for the king in western capitals but it is no longer given “unconditionally”. If the king continues to be seen as an obstacle to peace – by refusing to reciprocate Maoist ceasefires and by refusing engagement with the parties – and persists in travelling down an autocratic path diplomats believe will ultimately lead to a complete Maoist takeover of the country, India, Britain and the US could shift from a position of officially supporting the monarchy to one of letting the people decide.“That is not yet our position, but it could be,” says one top western diplomat. Whether Crown Prince Paras can hear their pleas over the roar of his Harley, though, is hard to tell.Bhutan’s monarch sets a peaceful example to a fractious neighbourIf Nepal’s King Gyanendra is looking for advice on how to preserve his throne, he could do worse than to look at neighbouring Bhutan, another landlocked and mountainous country wedged between India and China.In mid-December, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, Bhutan’s absolute monarch, announced that he would hold the country’s first national democratic elections in 2008 and hand over a constitutional monarchy to his son, the crown prince. By deciding to pre-empt demands for democracy, the Bhutanese kinghas displayed great wisdom. Such is his popularity that public enthusiasm for his new democratic constitution, now under discussion, has so far been minimal.Last week, the Bhutanese Crown Prince felt compelled to embark on a national tour to reassure people the monarch would continue to play an important role in Bhutan, despite the transition to democracy.The contrast with Nepal is stark. Nepal’s monarchy gave up absolute rule and handed power to political parties in 1990 after 50 days of street protests, but backtracked in February 2005 when the king seized power and sacked the government.Like Nepal, Bhutan has also provided China with an opportunity to tweak India’s nose this winter. In late December, Indian newspapers reported that 300 Chinese troops had made an uninvited incursion into Bhutan to build roads and bridges.Rattled by the development, the tiny kingdom informed New Delhi, discussed the matter in its parliament and told Beijing it had violated the 1998 Sino-Bhutanese treaty of peace and tranquillity. Relations between the two countries are now tense, with Beijing uneasy about the arrival of democracy on its southern flank. Bhutan, like Nepal, borders the Tibet region of China and fears Chinese claims on it. Three similar Buddhist kingdoms – Tibet, Sikkim and Ladakh – have disappeared as independent states. As a result, Bhutan for years had a deliberate policy of isolation, fearing outside influences would undermine its system of government.The 50-year-old king, who has wielded absolute power since the age of 16 with a philosophy of maximising “gross national happiness” rather than domestic product, has not made clear how much power his successor will retain in the new framework.The draft constitution provides for two houses of parliament – a 75-member National Assembly and a 25-member National Council. The king will remain head of state but be impeachable by two-thirds vote.Taking advantage of blistering Sino-Indian growth, however, will require Bhutan to throw open its economy. This process has started modestly with the development of a tightly controlled tourism industry.While economic growth is considered important, Bhutan is deeply concerned with preserving its culture, environment and identity and has let its economic development be guided by GNH.As a result of prudent macroeconomic management, development of hydropower resources and donor support, Bhutan has made good economic progress with GDP growth averaging 8 per cent over the past five years, according to the World Bank.Living standards have risen rapidly since Bhutan began a modernisation drive in the 1960s. With an average per capita annual income of $720, Bhutan’s 830,000 population is the richest in South Asia. Nepal’s 28m – on $260 – are the poorest.With its economy ravaged by war and dependent on remittances, Nepal is far behind but its potential, in hydropower and tourism, in particular, leaves scope for optimism.“Nepal has the potential to be the first middle-income country in South Asia if peace is restored,” says Sultan Hafeez Rahman, country director of the Asian Development Bank.

It rose from 310th place to end the year 16th and worth $160bn; less than half General Electric’s $373.2bn capitalisation.Oil’s high price lifted the producers’ valuations but had the opposite effect on the big carmakers.Ford, the US group, stayed among the world’s top 500 companies by the slimmest margin at 498. It had begun the year at 213. General Motors dropped out altogether, as did Harley Davidson and Peugeot, the French carmaker.Other names to disappear from the list include Gillette, the household and personal products group acquired by Procter & Gamble; Nextel, the telecommunications group bought by Sprint; and Lucent Technologies, telecommunications equipment manufacturer, whose share price failed to perform.But Lucent’s ejection was not typical of the technology sector’s performance and five years after the dotcom bubble, technology stocks are back. Softbank, the Japanese internet investment group that owns nearly 42 per cent of Yahoo Japan, was the third-biggest climber; up 192 places to 167.Apple, US computer maker, entered the top 100 at 88, high on the success of its iPod digital music player. This time last year, it was at 210.Google was history’s fastest growing company, having floated only 18 months ago. Highest new entry at 46, it would be higher still if stock not openly traded were included in its valuation."
134;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Hence, he is revisiting his energy policy in an attempt to commit to nuclear power; returning once more to education to reignite his early idealism and passion. He is currently in the first flushes of a fling with Legacy; he’s obsessed with her and she likes him, but it is not clear whether it is a lasting relationship.We can imagine the PM forsaking his car and getting astride the Harley Davidson on which he doubtless once pictured himself. His private office has found the current address of some of his old policy flames and he guns the engine and speeds off to see them.First stop: a meeting with his first true love, Education.“What went wrong between us, Education Policy? It was so great at first. We held hands, pumped cash into the system, introduced the numeracy and literacy strategy.”“I wanted more than you could give me, Tony. I wanted parental choice, school freedom. I wanted the private sector helping to run academies and freedom from the dead hand of the local education authorities. But every time I tried to talk to you, you got that distant look or were busy making lists of your five favourite crackdowns or the best criminal justice policies for a first date with the Sun.”“It was the Labour party – my family. They didn’t like you. They said you were wild and would make me go too far one day.”“Why didn’t you stand up to them, Tony? You said we’d change the world.”“I know. I’ve learnt my lesson.
I wish I’d gone further, faster. I’m standing up to them now.”“I’ve heard it all before, Tony.The PM turns to the camera. “She had such hopes for me. We could have done great things together. Was I too scared of my family?”Chastened by this conversation, he heads towards the home of another burned initiative, pulling up outside a nuclear power station, gone to seed.“Where were you, Tony? I waited.”“I’m here now, Nuclear Policy.”“What took you so long? You held that energy review in 2002. I thought we were going to be together.”“I’m sorry. It was my family and the public. They were never keen on you. They thought you were toxic. I was frightened to face them down.”“The man I knew was always facing down his family, telling them to change. Telling them he wasn’t prepared to live in that dreary old semi on opposition street for ever.”“We’re gonna do this thing. I am green lighting new nuclear plants.”“When?”“As soon as my new review of energy policy is complete. Where are you going? Don’t cry. I mean it this time. I won’t let them stop me again.”Outside the British HQ of the European Commission, stands the elegant European Policy.“Your problem is you can’t commit, Tony. So what if your friends didn’t like me. You said you liked me. You said I’d be at the heart of your life.”“You will be, European Policy. It just takes time to win people round. I’m working on it. I’m going to do the budget deal. To hell with the rebate. I’ll show how I feel about you . . . Just as soon as I get some movement on agricultural subsidies, square the press and clear it with Gordon.”“It’s too late, Tony, way too late.”“She’s right. Suddenly it all got too difficult and I just lost interest. But it wasn’t always that way. I held my nerve on Iraq. Some say I rushed in. Maybe I was overcompensating, wanting to stand up to the family. Anyway, that didn’t end well, either.”Or perhaps the bike is speeding to the crumbling home of another long-term flame – Pension Policy.“I told you I’d be back.”“Who are you?”“It’s me – Tony.”“I didn’t recognise you. Must be getting old.”“The Turner report is out soon. I said I’d fix things, Pension Policy.”“That’s what you said in ’98, when we were first stepping out. You promised me a big bang but all I got was a stakeholder pension.”“It was Gordon. He wouldn’t pay for it. But I’m ready to stand up to him in the two years or whatever is left to me before I hand over to him.”“Will you finish it before you go?”“We’ll make strides. There’ll be roadshows; debates; a big conversation, perhaps. This cave-in on public sector pensions is just a glitch. It doesn’t mean anything.”“You always did talk a good game, Tony.”Again, to the camera: “They all lost faith in me. I let them all down. I won’t make that mistake again. I’ll show I can commit. I’ll face down the family or die trying. There’s still time to get things right with Legacy.”"

137;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2005-10-12T20:41:26Z;Tech stocks suffer on Wall Street;;Disappointing quarterly earnings and downbeat analyst comments kept Wall Street technology stocks on the back foot on Wednesday.Apple Computer weighed on the sector a day after the maker of iPods reported below-forecast quarterly revenues, sending its shares 4.5 per cent lower to $49.25. PortalPlayer, which supplies the chips for iPods, was down 3.2 per cent to $26.13.The decline made the tech-laced Nasdaq Composite the worst performer of the three main US equity gauges and sent it to its lowest point in 3½ months.Downgrades compounded the technology sector’s woes. Prudential downgraded Intel, as well as the rest of the semiconductor sector. Shares in the world’s largest chipmaker headed 0.8 per cent lower to $23.24.Intel pulled its closest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, in its wake. AMD’s above-forecast quarterly results were overshadowed by dented hopes of higher margins. The Prudential analyst who was downbeat about Intel was positive about AMD, but this still did not prevent AMD shares from falling 12.5 per cent to $20.99. AMD has still managed to outperform the Philadelphia Semiconductor index so far this year.The chip index eased 0.4 per cent, with more than half of its 19 components bucking the downward trend. Risers included Texas Instruments, up 2.2 per cent to $29.72, and KLA Tencor, up 1.5 per cent to $46.55.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4 per cent, or 35.70 points, to 10,217.47, while the broader S&P 500 index edged off 0.6 per cent, or 7.15 points, to 1,177.72. The Nasdaq Composite index was 1.2 per cent, or 23.62 points, lower at 2,037.47.Marc Pado, US market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said that the market was approaching oversold levels fast and estimated that “being bullish sometime in the middle of next week will be the right camp to be in”.The Dow received strong support from Pfizer, which gained 2.2 per cent to $24.84 after a British judge blocked an attempt by a rival company to copy Pfizer’s highly successful Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol drug.Elsewhere among drug stocks, Merck put on 0.2 per cent to $26.80 while GlaxoSmithKline’s US-listed shares added 1.2 per cent to $50.73. However, it was Schering-Plough’s 4.2 per cent advance to $20.67 that led the gains for the Amex Pharmaceutical Index, which climbed 0.4 per cent.The drumroll of earnings reports continued, and Harley-Davidson shares added 2.9 per cent to $46.94 after the maker of the iconic motorcycles reported a 16 per cent increase in quarterly profits.True Religion’s guidance to better-than-expected profits was not enough to halt a 13.4 per cent decline in the clothing maker’s stock to $13.81. Analysts at Wedbush Morgan downgraded it, citing valuation concerns.
138;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2005-10-05T20:28:56Z;Profit warnings drag Wall Street lower;;Wall Street closed sharply lower for a second straight day on Wednesday amid profit warnings and economic data that raised fresh fears of the curse of stagflation.The Institute for Supply Management’s services sector index indicated that activity was slowing much faster than expected and showed prices paid surging to record levels.“We have growth that looks like it’s not sustainable and inflation that’s starting to hit everywhere,” said Chris Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “Stagflation talk is back and, at best, this is a market that is going to go sideways.”The data came just a day after three Federal Reserve members made hawkish noises about inflation and interest rates, with Thomas Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Fed, joining the chorus on Wednesday.As a result the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.2 per cent lower at 10,317.36, with the S&P 500 off 1.5 per cent at 1,196.39 and the Nasdaq Composite 1.7 per cent weaker at 2,103.02. The wave of profit warnings continued, with ADC Telecommunications slumping 13.5 per cent to $19.60 as it cut its fourth-quarter earnings guidance to 15-19 cents a share from 24-28 cents, due to weak sales of one of its cable products.Furniture maker La-Z-Boy fell 7 per cent to $12.37 after it said it would “significantly miss” earnings and sales forecasts for the current quarter owing to a shortage of foam padding, a weak retail environment and the impact from Hurricane Rita, which badly damaged a plant in Mississippi.Software maker Mercury Interactive slumped 14.5 per cent to $31.54 as it cut its third-quarter earnings estimate, citing the delayed timing of several large transactions and the restructuring of its European operations.Motorola dipped 1.4 per cent to $22.00. Late on Tuesday the mobile phone maker said it would take a third-quarter charge of $90m to cover severance payments related to a cost-cutting plan and asset write-downs.But Yum Brands, the owner of the Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut chains, rose 0.9 per cent to $48.68 as third-quarter profit rose 16 per cent, helped by its fast-growing Chinese operation.Burger chain Wendy’s reported a 5 per cent fall in like-for-like sales, but its shares still rose 1.2 per cent to $47.26 on the likelihood of an easing in beef prices.But General Motors slipped 4.8 per cent to $29.29 after it unveiled plans to sell its 20 per cent stake in Fuji Heavy Industries of Japan, with Toyota Motor paying $315m for an 8.7 per cent stake and the remainder being sold via a share buyback programme.Troubled auto parts maker Delphi plunged a further 10.4 per cent to $2.49 on renewed bankruptcy fears and Harley-Davidson fell 6.1 per cent to $44.82 as Bank of America downgraded the motorcycle maker amid worries of slowing demand.
139;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2005-07-13T17:45:35Z;Harley Davidson is leader of the pack;;The markets were little changed on Wednesday as investors digested a variety of mixed economic and corporate news.Wall Street was bolstered by some unexpectedly good news about the US trade deficit, which narrowed in May to $55.3bn. Although energy supply data showed stocks of crude falling because of storm disruption to oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, crude futures actually fell 61 cents to $60.01 for August delivery. A fall in oil is generally considered to be a positive development as high energy prices can erode corporate profits.Although the earnings season was not quite in full swing, there were good figures from a variety of companies. Harley Davidson led the pack with a 1.4 per cent rise in its share price to $50.38 on the back of better than expected results.By the close, the S&P 500 had crept up at 1,223.29, while the Nasdaq Composite was also slightly up at 2,144.11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 10,557.39.Edward Hemmelgarn, chief investment officer at Shaker Investments, said the markets flatness disguised an essentially positive momentum.“Keep in mind that the market has been moving rather strongly in July, and markets do not just go straight up without pausing for a day or so. It will continue to rise because analysts have once again underestimated earnings growth, and supply is falling in the market as companies buy back shares.”Among the most eagerly expected earnings news of the week will be Yum! Brands, the group behind KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, which was expected to report after the bell yesterday. Elsewhere in the sector, California Pizza Kitchen and Buffalo Wild Wings enjoyed a good day after they raised their earnings outlooks for the second quarter. Pizza Kitchen rose 15.4 per cent to $31.94 and Buffalo Wild Wings added 10.2 per cent, climbing to $33.14.Also moving were shares of Resources Connection, a provider of professional, legal, accounting and other staff, which added to gains in Tuesday’s after-hours session after it posted earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. The stock was up 20.1 percent at $29.35.There was some disappointing news from the drugmaker Abbott Laboratories, which dropped 4.2 per cent $47.65 after the company said third-quarter profit would be below expectations.IBM helped to bolster the Dow after an analyst at Sanford Bernstein raised the company’s performance rating. IBM rose 1.8 per cent to $81.45.Procter & Gamble and Gilletteboth gained ground on the news that the shareholders of the two consumer products giants had agreed to P&G’s proposed $52.5bn acquisition of Gillette. P&G moved 1.2 per cent higher to $54.58 while Gillette was 1.2 per cent higher at $52.30.
140;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2005-04-14T20:47:17Z;Market Overview: Equities ease on US concerns;;World equity markets fell on Thursday, dragged down by deepening concerns over the outlook for the US economy and corporate earnings.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average touched a fresh intra-day low for the year as a mixed start to the earnings season for US corporates added to worries over by poor retail sales data on Wednesday.The market has seen some relief this week from two recent negatives overhanging equity valuations – high oil prices and rising treasury yields. Both oil prices and bond yields have fallen. Oil briefly fell below the $50 mark yesterday for the first time in seven weeks.But these concerns have been replaced by worries over the US economy and consumer demand.After Harley-Davidson disappointed the market by cutting its profit targets for the year on Wednesday, it was the turn of Apple to slide after its revenue growth failed to meet expectations. The Apple setback and an unexpected first-quarter loss from Advanced Micro Devices offset strong results from the likes of Pepsi-Co and Southwest Airlines.World markets were also weighed down by weakness in mining and energy stocks following the fall in metal and crude oil prices this week. By the close of trade, the Dow was down 1.2 per cent, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.4 per cent.European shares were dragged lower by the Wall Street performance despite gains for most of the day on continental exchanges. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index dropped 0.2 per cent. Asian shares also fell. The Nikkei 225 index closed 0.6 per cent lower at 11,563.17, its lowest level since February 24.The dollar rose despite recent poor economic news. There were rumours that big investors, including Warren Buffett, were buying back the dollar after taking large positions against it.Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroders, said there was potential for the US economy to hit another “soft patch” in coming months amid high oil prices and increases in interest rates.“Rapidly rising commodity prices can be seen along with house prices as a sign of excess liquidity in global markets. An excess that the Fed will gradually drain from the system in coming months,” he said. “This means that we could see the combination of higher Fed funds alongside lower commodity prices later in the year. Markets would have to balance the implications of higher interest rates against the benefits of lower energy and raw material costs.”
141;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2005-04-13T21:52:47Z;Market Overview: Consumer slowdown puts damper on oil and interest rate cheer;;"A relief rally on world equity markets after the US Federal Reserve signalled a less hawkish than expected approach to interest rates this week came to a halt on Wednesday after disappointing US retail sales figures for March.The sales data offset the positive impact of a further fall in oil prices and a continued easing in bond yields following Tuesday’s release of the minutes of the March interest rate policy-setting meeting of the Federal Open Markets Committee.The minutes were hardly conclusive in giving clues about monetary policy direction but were widely interpreted as hinting that rate rises were unlikely to be accelerated. This was enough to prompt a Wall Street rally on Tuesday and follow-through gains on European markets yesterday. The dollar also came under pressure while 10-year US treasury yields hit a five-week low of 4.36 per cent.However, the lack of conviction behind the equity rally became clear after
the Commerce Department reported US retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent in March. This was far less than the 0.7 per cent rise expected by the market and shares retreated as sentiment was hit by the signs
of weakness in consumer spending.ING said seasonal adjustment problems might account for some of the undershoot due to the early timing of Easter this year, while the surge in imports of cheap Chinese textiles may also have contributed to a decline in the value of sales even if volumes remained firm. The bank added that high petrol prices remained a threat to sales in the
coming months by eroding purchasing power.A mixed start to the current US corporate earnings season also weighed on Wall Street with reasonable results from McDonald’s offset by a warning of a slowdown in profit growth by Harley-Davidson. About 31 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report quarterly results this week including the corporate goliaths Citigroup and General Electric. Next week about 160 companies will report. Technology shares were also hit yesterday by a downbeat forecast on orders by ASML, the Dutch electronic chip equipment maker.By the end of the trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent, while the S&P 500 index fell 1.2 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite index was 1.6 per cent lower.In Europe, shares rallied early on but struggled to make further progress in
the afternoon. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index broke through the psychological hurdle of the 1,100-points mark, rising 0.4 per cent to 1,101.82. The close left the index within striking distance of its 33-month high of 1,109 struck in early March.In Asia, Tokyo shares retreated after an accounting scandal surrounding Kanebo, the maker of textiles and toiletries, which admitted it had been overstating profits for years. Akiyoshi Nakajima, Kanebo’s chairman, was quoted as saying: “We decided that we had to uncover the truth about the past even if it meant facing harsh criticism from society.”Crude prices also fell after a higher-than-expected rise in oil inventories was revealed in weekly data supplied by the US Energy Information Administration. It was the ninth straight week that crude oil stocks rose, and the highest US crude commercial inventory level since June 2002. The fall also came after the International Energy Agency said in its monthly report that for the first time in two years, the risks on demand for oil were “edging towards the downside”."
142;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2005-04-13T16:26:50Z;Harley Davidson takes unaccustomed skid;;Harley-Davidson took an unaccustomed skid on Wednesday after warning of lower-than-expected earnings and announcing a cut in production of its distinctive motorcycles.Shares of the Milwaukee-based company were 17 per cent lower at $48.84 in New York at noon, pushing Harley's market value back below General Motors. Harley overtook the world's biggest carmaker last month after GM sharply lowered its profit estimates.Building on 19 consecutive years of record revenue and profits, Harley reported record first-quarter earnings of $227.2m, or 77 cents a share, up from $204.6m, or 68 cents, a year earlier. Revenues climbed by almost 6 per cent.But US motorcycle sales were ”relatively flat” in the first quarter, falling short of expectations. Second quarter earnings are now likely to be lower than last year, while earnings for the year as a whole are expected to grow by about 5-8 per cent, down from the earlier projection of a 15 per cent increase.Harley now expects to ship 329,000 bikes this year, 3.7 per cent more than in 2004 but 10,000 units fewer than its previous estimate. The drop in output will occur almost entirely in the second quarter.The cutback could jeopardise Harley's goal of reaching a production rate of 400,000 bikes in 2007. Still, Jim Ziemer, chief financial officer who will shortly take over as chief executive, said that “we see no reason to change our long-term unit growth projection of 7-9 per cent annually based on just three winter months of sales data”.
143;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2005-03-27T21:09:26Z;Europe hopeful of change in Cuba;;The last time Louis Michel, the European Union's commissioner for development and humanitarian aid, was in Havana he rode a Harley Davidson down a balmy Malecon, the city's picturesque seaside drive.That was in 2001 when he was Belgium's foreign minister. Mr Michel was back over the Easter weekend looking to mend the EU's tattered ties with the Communist-run island two years after President Fidel Castro locked up 75 pro-democracy activists. This time a motorcycle ride did not seem appropriate.“I am far more hopeful than I was before I came,” was about all Mr Michel had to say for his visit, which included a four-hour talk with Mr Castro, meetings with other officials, dissidents and Catholic Cardinal Jaime Ortega.“Cuba and the European Union must make a real effort to renew a political dialogue,” he said, before departing on Sunday.Mr Michel is a veteran of the on-again off-again political dialogue begun in 1996 when the EU tied improved relations on Cuban progress towards a more open society. He said authorities wanted improved relations based on “mutual respect for sovereignty and reciprocity”.Felipe Perez Roque, Cuban foreign minister, saidas much before Mr Michel's arrival but added thata fresh start should bemade by ripping up the 1996 common position.He said that was forced on the EU by José Mar´a Aznar, then conservative Spanish prime minister, in complicity with the US. “It is a unilateral measure and a conditional document aimed at reducing relations, not one that stimulates a dialogue and looks to improve relations,” Mr Perez said.In contrast to Mr Aznar's strong support for sanctions, Spain's new Socialist government has pushed for EU dialogue with Cuba.When the EU retaliated over the 2003 crackdown by stopping official visits and inviting dissidents to national day receptions, Mr Castro declared “we do not need Europe”. He cancelled plans to join the Cotonou aid agreement with Europe's former colonies and ordered his government to snub European diplomats in Havana.When the EU temporarily suspended sanctions for six months this year on condition that Cuba improve the human rights situation, Mr Castro said he did not need anyone's pardon for jailing enemy mercenaries.Mr Castro did conditionally release 14 of his opponents for health reasons and lifted the ban on contact with EU country diplomats.“I think things have changed, because yesterday during four hours I had in front of me a very kind man, very skilful and very healthy, full of energy, who seems to be wishing to make some headway with the European Union,” Mr Michel said.He added that the EU position on human rights and the release of imprisoned dissidents remained unchanged, but the bloc was not setting conditions for Cuba in the hope that engagement, rather than sanctions, would bring about improvements.But on Palm Sunday hundreds of flag waving and chanting government supporters besieged a few of the imprisoned dissidents' wives and female relatives as they peacefully protested by walking, dressed in white, down a main avenue in the Miramar district of Havana.“I am sceptical the government will respond positively to the EU initiative,” says Elizardo Sanchez, who heads the illegal but tolerated Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. “The situation in terms of civil, political and economic rights has deteriorated in recent days and it appears it will deteriorate further, barring a miracle.”He pointed to the recent mob action, last used more than a decade ago to silence dissent, and what he termed “threatening rhetoric”. Various officials have stated that the streets are for patriots and revolutionaries, not US mercenaries, which is what the government brands all opponents.Local analysts say Mr Castro's ways have little to do with Europe and everything to do with his arch-enemy the US.As Cuba's pro-democracy movement remains isolated and divided, the US has further tightened the embargo, doubled already hefty aid to dissidents and taken to calling for a regime change.Meanwhile, Mr Castro, 78, has found new strength from Chinese loans and a close alliance with Venezuela, which provides cheap oil in exchange for doctors. Europe, however, remains Cuba's main trading partner.Mr Castro, in power since 1959, speaks to the nation every Thursday evening about how the economy, in crisis since the demise of the Soviet Union, is on the mend after the tightening of state controls.Both Amnesty International and Christine Chanet, special United Nations envoy to investigate Cuban human rights abuses, condemned the situation on the island as the annual UN meeting on human rights got under way in Geneva.They also said the US approach provided Cuban authorities with an excuse for more, not less, repression.
144;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2004-12-13T20:21:50Z;Observer - US;;"BofA's top secret strategyDo you know that feeling of sending an e-mail then realising, with a sinking feeling, that it went to the wrong person? One poor analyst at Bank of America knows all too well: he broadcast internal restructuring plans for the bank's fixed income strategy team to a group of reporters.Still, he is not alone in this. Some will recall the London Stock Exchange's famous bungle during its planned merger with Deutsche Börse in 2000. The merger was supposedly friendly but looked otherwise after the LSE accidentally e-mailed newsdesks with an internal memo outlining its plans in the event of a merger collapse, plans best summed up as ""blame the Germans"".(Undeterred, Deutsche Börse on Monday launched another bid to take over the LSE.)As for Monday's BofA missive, said analyst e-mailed three minutes later with an excuse - jet lag and a lack of sleep - and a plea for the e-mail to be deleted. It happens to the best of us.Hog wildIt is hard to imagine any male chief executive getting more satisfaction from his company's products than the boss of Harley-Davidson. So it comes as no surprise to learn that the famed motorcycle maker's new chief executive Jim Ziemer owns three Harleys, including a 2003 Screamin' Eagle Road King.His predecessor, Jeff Bleustein, is also an avid rider of his Electra Glide and V-Rod bikes.Harley-Davidson has performed as well as its bikes in recent years. Its current market value of almost $18bn is not far behind General Motors' $22bn. Too bad Harley is based in Milwaukee, where the weather is hardly conducive to year-round riding. But in summer employees' bikes are lined up for a block or more in front of the head office.Very PCWhen Lenovo of China agreed to buy IBM's personal computer business, the deal included Big Blue's notebook operations in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. So what do the workers at what was a prestige foreign operation make of being returned to the mainland fold?Observer's man at the factory gates says the employees are not thrilled by the prospect of going to work for a lesser known domestic brand. Possible job losses and pay cuts are a worry.One young engineer admitted to a ""sense of loss"", despite having attended a meeting where Lenovo executives tried some inspirational talk about bright prospects for the enlarged group.According to another, ""the whole company seems placid. When we talk about it, we feel calm"". A third employee said he preferred IBM's culture to Lenovo's, although he wasn't sure what the IBM culture was.Tech rageFrustrated by complex features on new mobile phones? Overwhelmed by the intricacies of the latest computer software? Then try barbecuing an old computer mouse or, better, run an obsolete desktop through a carwash.This might be the best way to minimise ""computer rage,"" an increasingly common phenomenon that is putting new technology at risk, say two psychology professors at the University of Maryland.The pair have conducted an informal survey on technology frustration and rage for the past three years and found nearly 20 per cent of respondents admitted to dropping computers on the floor in a fit of pique. About 40 per cent confessed to mutilating a CD-ROM, while 80 per cent said they had cursed at their computers.Roughly speaking, about 10 per cent of high-tech gifts this holiday season may fall victim to ""computer rage"", they conclude. ""When people sink $3,000 into a new plasma TV and something goes wrong, sometimes a killer instinct takes over,"" says Kent Norman, who calls his research serious and silly.The answer to ""computer rage"" is to take out one's frustration on old equipment. Should one opt to cook up an old mouse, however, they suggest marinating it before throwing it on the barbecue.Free traitorPaul Samuelson is back stirring up the world of economics. The Nobel laureate who once accused J. S. Mill of perpetuating a shell game in his writings on free trade has come out swinging in The Journal of Economic Perspectives.He wrote recently that free trade outsourcing could lead to irreparable damage to the standard of living of America's semi-skilled and blue collar workers and exacerbate economic inequality in the US.Samuelson's apostate comments have been dismissed by free trade apostles such as the editors of The Economist and former student Jagdish Bhagwati as unrealistic. But his publisher, McGraw Hill, and editor Gary Burke are delighted.If his seminal textbook Economics is the Bible, says Burke, then Samuelson is the Messiah. With over 4m copies sold, he is to his publisher.Dollar dolourThese are dark days for the dollar but it is cheering to know that there is nothing so bad that currency traders cannot set it to music.

145;HOG;Harley-Davidson Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Gulf Arab holidaymakers travel closer to home;;"Instead of heading to the Florida coast this summer one Arab, a financial analyst, jumped on his Harley-Davidson and cruised 2,000km across the Arabian desert to Beirut.For tourists from the Gulf states, the richer of whom are among the world's top spenders, delays in getting visas to the US - and to a lesser extent Europe - and the suspicion that greets them at airports once they get there, has been changing travelling habits over the past three summers.""If it weren't for this, I'd be scuba diving in Key Largo now,"" says the analyst, speaking from the Mediterranean coast of Lebanon.The war on terror has made staying closer to home in the Middle East more attractive to Gulf Arabs, who traditionally take their holidays over the summer when temperatures on the Arabian peninsula can reach 50°C.Governments and investors in the Middle East have been responding to growing demand from the region with a rash of multi-million dollar developments, ranging from marinas and luxury hotels in Lebanon, to airport expansions in Cairo and more shopping malls and leisure parks in Dubai.The surge in intra-regional travel is helping to fuel recovery for countries such as Egypt, where the tourism industry was suffering from perceptions of insecurity in the region and needed insurance against the more fickle appetite of its patrons in the west.The Gulf market is lucrative, and Saudis often arrive in Egypt without package deals and paying full hotel rates, says Ulrich Houth, manager of the 1,250-room Marriott hotel on the Nile, which enjoyed near full occupancy throughout the summer.Having a flood of visitors with a reputation for heavy spending is good for traders too. One linen and lingerie shop owner in Cairo said that because of customers from the Gulf, her sales for July and August would equal the rest of the year combined.The number of Gulf Arab visitors to Egypt rose by 32 per cent from January to July.Significantly, says Hala El Khatib, spokeswoman for the Egyptian tourism minister, the amount of time Saudi and other Arab visitors spent in Egypt once they got there nearly doubled. This changing dynamic is encouraging a rethink in the industry.European visitors tend to come to Egypt to see the pyramids and cruise the Nile or escape their urban lifestyles at Red Sea resorts. Arab visitors generally stay in town.""Egypt has been looking into ways of catering for the Arab demand more and more so for example we are seeing more shopping and concert festivals in Cairo during the summer months,"" says Mrs Khatib.A more proactive and business-friendly government appointed in July has also changed the sentiment of investors, says Samih Sawiris, chairman of Orascom Hotel holdings.His company has revitalised four hotel projects as a result.But he says that Egypt has tended to cater for lower budget travellers in bulk and there is some way to go before it can draw in the Gulf's top end spenders.""We have not really regained our standing in the Gulf market.""The cream of the cream will still go to Europe or Lebanon first,"" he says.""Until we see our infrastructure being upgraded in the way of Beirut and as long as the guys can't do serious shopping we're not going to be real competition.""Before the 1975-1990 civil war, Lebanon's mountain resorts were the favoured destination for wealthy Arabs seeking reprieve from the desert heat.Beirut was the commercial, night-life and banking centre for the region.Now its resurgent city centre and waterfront is drawing back Gulf Arab families and the occasional Saudi biker on vacation.It is also drawing Khalaf al-Habtoor, the Emirates tycoon, who is investing more than $310m (€252m, £172m) in a leisure park, hotel, convention centre and spa all due to open next year."
