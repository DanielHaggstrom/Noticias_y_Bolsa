0;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2018-05-02T04:00:43Z;Scepticism over ‘value’ comeback despite energy surge;Investment strategy gains are over-reliant on one sector, reflecting little broader shift;Energy shares were the top US market performers over the past month but the move has not been enough to renew faith that “value” investing is on the way back.The S&P 500 value index nudged ahead of its “growth” investing counterpart during April, with gains of 0.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively.But analysts were nonetheless reluctant to declare a shift in market dominance between the two diverse styles of investing — the gains in April were not supported by other key sectors considered to be classic value plays.Value investors look for companies trading at a discount to their future cash flows or break-up value while growth investing entails buying companies that offer the hope of above-average growth but often trade with a larger price tag.“Value is working but not because of any macro investor preference for cheap stocks,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek. “Rather, it comes down to sentiment about energy stocks and the near-term direction of oil prices.”The energy sector gained more than 9 per cent in April to lead the S&P 500. Energy companies account for 12 per cent of the S&P 500 Value index, only second to financials at 25 per cent.Investors embraced the shares of energy companies with Andeavor (being bought by Marathon Petroleum), Newfield Exploration, Valero Energy, Occidental Petroleum and Pioneer Natural Resources among the top performers in the S&P 500 in April.“At the same time I had the energy story, I had industrials falling and financials were flat,” said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank.“Given the size of financials within the value groups, it is financials that have to move to have a sustained rotation from growth to value,” he added.Financial shares fell 0.5 per cent in April and industrials lost 2.9 per cent. Tech eked out a 0.03 per cent rise.Consumer staples, which make up 11 per cent of the value index, were the worst performers in April, dragged down by losses at stocks of Philip Morris, Kraft Heinz and Procter & Gamble.Value beat growth in March as well, and six out of the past 12 months based on S&P 500 indices, but remains a long-term laggard in performance to growth.“Value in a broad sense has been underperforming for over a decade,” said Tim Edwards, managing director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “It is not supposed to guarantee returns in the short term but people have begun to question how much patience do you need.”Sharp gains for the shares of high-growth technology companies, particularly a handful of large groups known as the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet) have helped to propel growth investing styles in recent years.But tech shares have stumbled this year on concerns about privacy and heightened regulation.Tech accounts for 41 per cent of the S&P 500 growth index, while energy is also in the index but accounts for just 0.3 per cent.
1;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2017-09-04T09:08:07Z;The impact of Harvey;How the tropical storm in Texas has left the oil industry facing multiple difficulties;Tropical Storm Harvey hit the coast of Texas near Corpus Christi last Friday night, and over the subsequent days brought “unprecedented” rainfall to the heartland of the US oil and gas industry. By Friday, at least 46 people had been reported to have died as a result of the storm.More than 45 inches of rain fell in some areas around Houston, with the heaviest downpour hitting the area to the south of the city. The highest recorded rainfall was nearly 52 inches at Cedar Bayou, not far from “refinery row” between Houston and Baytown. The National Weather Service reported flooding across an area about 250 miles long by 100 miles wide. The volume of rainfall has made Harvey a “1,000-year flooding event” for Texas, according to Shane Hubbard of the University of Wisconsin. Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, said he expected Harvey to be more costly than Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or super-storm Sandy in 2012. Katrina cost about $75bn in insured losses and, along with two other hurricanes that same year, triggered more than $100bn in federal spending. The damage from Sandy in the US was estimated at about $71bn, and the relief and reconstruction package approved by Congress was costed at about $50bn.About a quarter of the offshore oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico was shut in at the peak on Saturday, but the more significant impact on energy supplies appears to have come from the flooding onshore. Southern Texas is home to the heaviest concentration of refineries, pipelines and terminals in the US, processing and transporting fuel for the US and world markets. Many companies including Valero Energy, ExxonMobil, Motiva and Royal Dutch Shell shut down operations in southern Texas, and almost one-third of US refineries have been affected by the storm. Web pages with updates on the status of their operations were put up by Valero, Exxon and BP. The Energy Information Administration published a useful real-time graphic showing the track of the storm and other weather events in relation to US refineries, pipelines and production platforms, and the Department of Energy has been publishing regular updates on the impact on the regions oil, gas and electricity industries.The US shale oil boom has increased the concentration of US oil and gas infrastructure in Texas, reflecting the importance of the Eagle Ford formation in the south of the state and the Permian Basin in the west. Antoine Halff of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, published a thoughtful note on the resilience of US energy supplies in the age of shale, concluding: “No country, no matter how mighty an oil and gas producer it may be, is beyond the threat of catastrophic damage.” His colleague Jason Bordoff drew five lessons for policymakers. Housley Carr of RBN Energy had a useful overview of effects on oil markets. There was some panic-buying of fuel that caused shortages in and around Dallas, but on the whole US markets were adequately supplied, with an armada of tankers on its way to bring gasoline from Europe. The US wholesale gasoline price has risen by a third since before the storm, but fell back on Friday morning. The American Automobile Association predicted that the average retail price of gasoline in the US would spike to about $2.50 per gallon, its highest since 2015, but forecast it would quickly fall back by the end of the month.Fears of cholera and typhoid in the water, and toxic substances leaking from polluted “superfund” sites, have added to concerns about the impact of the flood. One focus for concern has been the fires at the organic peroxides plant in Crosby owned by Arkema, the French chemicals group spun off from Total in 2004. The Environmental Defense Fund published a blog post highlighting how the EPA had recently suspended the implementation of new regulations that would have imposed additional requirements on chemicals plants including Arkema’s.The question of the influence of climate change on the storm was discussed by Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University, Andrew King of Melbourne University, Friederike Otto of Oxford university, and The Atlantic. As Phil Klotzbach of Colorado State University pointed out on Twitter, the number of severe Category 4 and 5 hurricanes hitting US appears to have slowed sharply in recent decades. Before Harvey, the US had gone for 4,323 days without a hurricane in Category 3 or above making landfall, the longest period on record. But as well as its unprecedented rainfall, Harvey broke other unwelcome records, including persisting as a named storm longer than any other after making landfall in Texas.Climate science and policy were debated last week as a result of an article in the journal Environmental Research Letters by Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes of Harvard University. Discrepancies between what different employees of Exxon have said about climate change at different times and in different places have been a focus for environmental campaigners since reporting by InsideClimate News and the LA Times with Columbia Journalism School in 2015. The attorneys-general of New York State and Massachusetts have been investigating ExxonMobil over whether the company misled investors with public statements about climate change that were different from its private understanding. Exxon has sued the AGs, accusing them of acting in bad faith and going on a politically-motivated “unlawful fishing expedition”.Mr Supran and Ms Oreskes, who are respectively a postdoctoral fellow and a professor in the history of science at Harvard, took a different approach from the legal inquiries. They compared Exxon’s public stance on climate science and policy, as expressed in paid advertorials for the New York times over 1989-2004, with the views of its employees in internal documents and published scientific papers, and found clear differences between the statements heard by different audiences. Exxon rejected the analysis, saying the study had been “paid for, written and published by activists leading a five-year campaign against the company”, and was “inaccurate and preposterous”. Mr Supran and Ms Oreskes responded with a column in the Los Angeles Times, stressing that “the question is not whether ExxonMobil ‘suppressed climate change research,’ but rather how they communicated about it.”Nick Butler — Why the oil market should not misread Venezuela“It’s not just things. It’s history. That can’t be replaced . . . When I first saw it, all I could do was just sit in the yard and cry.” — Rachel Williams of Rosenberg, Texas, on the flooding that forced her to flee her home for the second time in 15 months.
2;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2017-01-26T11:00:58Z;Trump adviser Icahn faces conflict of interest scrutiny over biofuels;Billionaire gains on investment in oil refiner ahead of rule change;Donald Trump’s election has doubled the value of an energy company owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who was appointed special adviser to the president on regulatory reform. CVR Energy shares have surged on the expectation that the new administration will ease environmental rules including a federal biofuel mandate criticised by Mr Icahn that costs CVR more than $200m a year. Traders betting that the Trump administration will weaken the mandate have driven down prices for US ethanol credits that CVR and other refiners must purchase. The declines snowballed this week after the president imposed a freeze on new federal rules. “It’s true that I would benefit as a refinery owner, but so would every refinery as well as the small gas station owners and as far as I’m concerned the public, because certain of these refineries can now stay alive,” Mr Icahn said in an interview. By serving as an adviser without becoming a federal employee who would be required to separate himself from his investments, Mr Icahn has attracted scrutiny. His holdings span energy, railcars, finance and other regulated businesses. He helped the Trump team vet Scott Pruitt, who has been picked to run the Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees the biofuel mandate.“The EPA, in far too many instances, has run amok,” Mr Icahn told the Financial Times: “Overregulation is the reason corporations are afraid to invest and as a result there’s a lack of good jobs and productivity in this country.”“There’s a huge conflict of interest,” said Bruce Babcock, an energy economist at Iowa State University. Norman Eisen, a former legal ethics adviser for Barack Obama, said Mr Icahn’s title, responsibilities and involvement in personnel choices make him a “de facto special government employee” subject to conflicts rules preventing work on matters relating to his investments. The price of ethanol credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (Rins), has proven sensitive to news coming from the Trump team. They fell 8 per cent after Mr Pruitt was selected and another 6 per cent after Mr Icahn’s appointment. On Wednesday they plunged as low as 46 cents, down by more than half since December, according Oil Price Information Service. “This is the Icahn-Pruitt-Trump trade,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Opis. Mr Icahn’s general counsel, Jesse Lynn, called it “ludicrous” to suggest it was wrong for a businessman to offer advice on an industry he knew well. Mr Icahn will not take any actions that trigger government employee status and not be in a position to set policy, “merely to offer his suggestions,” Mr Lynn said. The market value of CVR, 82 per cent owned by Mr Icahn, has increased by $1.1bn since the election to $2.2bn. Congress passed the biofuel mandate in 2007 in an effort to wean the US from foreign oil. If refiners or importers cannot meet the target — set at 15bn gallons for corn ethanol this year — they must purchase Rins instead. Mr Icahn has criticised the provision, arguing the Rins market was riddled with fraud and that integrated oil companies and large petrol station chains should be required to buy them, not refineries.“Rins are the quintessential example of the absurdity of so many regulations the EPA has issued,” he said.Under Mr Obama, the EPA looked set to deny petitions to shift the Rin obligation away from refiners, arguing it could increase the complexity of an already complicated programme. The agency faces a test of its position after being sued in a Texas federal court last week by Valero Energy, the world’s biggest independent oil refiner, over the issue.In a confirmation hearing last week Mr Pruitt reassured senators that he would “make sure that the statute is upheld and enforced and not undermined”.Some experts doubted the Trump administration will water down the mandate, not least because it would infuriate the Corn Belt farmers who helped seal his victory. “It would be shocking for the president to cross those voters,” said Scott Irwin, an economist at the University of Illinois.But Barclays, in a research note, said it expected the new administration would cut required ethanol volumes and suggested ethanol Rins would drop further.

Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, rose 1.6 per cent to $46.59 a barrel.Oil prices tracked gasoline and diesel prices higher as the leak in the pipeline, which carries refined products from the biggest refining centre on the US Gulf coast to the biggest population centre on the US east coast, is only expected to be repaired over the weekend.“[The] Colonial pipeline leak has been bullish for East Coast gasoline,” said Aaron Pauker at RBC Capital Market.Shares in Marathon Petroleum climbed 4.5 per cent to $43.74, Valero Energy rose 3 per cent to $56.19 while Baker Hughes climbed 1.6 per cent to $49.18.Thursday’s gains took the sector’s year-to-date advance to 11.7 per cent.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 information technology climbed 1.7 per cent, driven by a rally in shares of Skyworks Solutions and Apple, the world’s most valuable company. Shares in Skyworks Solutions, which supplies chips to the iPhone maker, jumped more 6.4 per cent to $77.02.Apple, the world’s most valuable company, climbed 3.4 per cent to $115.57 — its shares have now advanced for four straight days, adding more than $60bn to its market valuation.Thursday’s advance took the gains in the technology sector to 1.5 per cent so far in September, leaving it the only sector in the green for the month.At the close, the S&P 500 had climbed 1 per cent to 2,147.3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 1 per cent to 18,212.5, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 per cent to 5,249.7.Elsewhere, US tyre manufacturer Goodyear Tire and Rubber rallied on Thursday after the company boosted its quarterly dividend by 43 per cent.Shares in the Boston-based company climbed 5.1 per cent to $32.39 after the company said it would increase its quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share as part of a plan to return up to $4bn to its shareholders.Meanwhile, shares in Global Payments rose 3.4 per cent to $76.05 after analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded the payment technology company to “buy” from “neutral” and raised their price target on the stock to $88 from $80, citing three key catalysts for the move.First, the upgrade was driven by analysts’ expectations that the company’s revenue growth could exceed 10 per cent over the next two years, ahead of consensus forecasts.Second, James Schneider, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, also said synergies from Global Payments’ $4.3bn acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems “are likely to exceed investor expectations”.Lastly, he noted: “We believe Global can benefit from industry consolidation, resulting in more benign pricing and lower churn.”mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

Oil and gas producers are big winners on the index this year, up 12 per cent — propelled by higher energy prices.Oil is on track for its biggest monthly gain in seven years with both West Texas Intermediate and Brent, the international benchmark, up over 20 per cent in April.Prices have rebounded from below $27 per barrel in the early weeks of the year — a 13-year low — on hopes that falling US production will help counter the ongoing oversupply and high crude oil inventories.Exxon, the world’s fourth-largest company by market capitalisation, released first-quarter results on Friday. Revenues were down 28 per cent while earnings fell 63 per cent year on year.The declines were less than expected and shares rose 1.9 per cent to $89.77, before closing up just 0.5 per cent at $88.45. Exxon’s shares were already up this week, despite the downgrade by Standard & Poor’s of the company to AA+.Market sentiment did improve when the US major showed restraint in increasing its dividend by just 3 per cent, the smallest rise in nearly a decade.In contrast, Chevron doubled expected losses. The US’s second-largest oil group reported a first-quarter after-tax loss of $725m.Its shares traded down 1.8 per cent to $100.61, closing 0.1 per cent down at $102.33. The stock remains up almost 14 per cent since the start of the year.Occidental Petroleum, another integrated oil and gas company, traded up 0.6 per cent to $76.67.Oil and gas refiners and marketers lost ground though.

5;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2015-12-16T19:10:31Z;End of US oil export ban brings only light relief;Domestic producers to compete for foreign markets for first time since 1970s oil embargoes;Washington lawmakers’ agreement to end 40-year-old restrictions on US crude oil exports provides some cheer for beleaguered energy companies as prices sit near their lowest level in seven years.The move will eventually allow domestic producers to compete for customers overseas for the first time since the Arab oil embargoes of the 1970s.But the world should not expect a flood of American oil anytime soon.Energy markets have changed since legislators first took up the cause of US producers suffering extreme price discounts for their crude. What was a domestic glut brought on by soaring shale oil production has spread overseas, with strong output from other countries building up global inventories as well.“You would be selling crude oil from the United States into a globally saturated market,” says Sarah Emerson, principal at ESAI Energy, a research group.That means that the clamour heard for US oil almost two years ago has quieted. West Texas Intermediate crude of the US now sells for about a dollar less than international benchmark Brent, a spread that hardly makes it worthwhile to ship cargoes from Texas to Europe, for example.Congress authorised the export ban in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo led to queues at petrol stations. At the time, crude export restrictions were needed to effect an economic policy that included price controls. But when price controls were abolished, the ban survived.As the US imported ever more crude, the ban for years was irrelevant for energy policy specialists. But as energy companies began to tap shale oil, imports fell sharply. The light, high-quality barrels extracted from regions such as Texas and North Dakota had difficulty finding enthusiastic buyers among oil refineries configured to digest heavier grades.Earlier this year, WTI’s discount to Brent was briefly more than $10 a barrel, prompting shale producers such ConocoPhillips and Continental Resources and their lobbyists to redouble their push to overturn the ban.The ban is porous: crude may be exported to Canada with a licence, for example, and the Obama administration in the past two years has also liberalised trade with Mexico and in an ultralight oil known as condensate. Through these avenues, US oil exports earlier this year rose as high as 600,000 b/d — more than the output of Ecuador, an Opec member.Michael Wojciechowski of consultants Wood Mackenzie says that in near future, allowing crude exports will probably redraw the map of destinations for US crude away from its near neighbours rather than boost overall volumes.“It might actually be a while before you see a net new barrel exported from the United States,” he says. “We are exporting barrels to eastern Canada and Mexico. What’s going to happen in the first instance is an optimisation of those exports.”Shares of US oil and gas exploration and production companies fell 2.4 per cent as WTI futures lurched down 4 per cent to $35.71 a barrel at midday in New York.In the longer term, the congressional agreement could be bad news for US refiners that have enjoyed fat profit margins by processing relatively cheap US crude into petrol and diesel sold at global prices.However, refinery investors seemed unbothered by the deal on Wednesday, with shares of Valero and PBF Energy each up 1 per cent. The legislation includes a tax credit for independent refiners, some of which are disadvantaged by another law that requires coastwise shipments of US crude to sail in more expensive US tankers.Oil producers were buoyant. John Hess, chief executive of Hess, a midsized independent US oil producer, says the decision “would have far reaching benefits for our country”, adding jobs, boosting investment in the US industry, and enhancing global energy security.Many Democrats had initially questioned the need to overturn the ban, raising concerns it would raise petrol prices and potentially increase greenhouse gas emissions as lower prices stimulated more consumption.Environmental groups reacted with fury to the lifting of the ban.Jason Kowalski of 350.org, which campaigns on climate change, calls the decision “political cowardice” and says: “This is a good reminder that, when left to their own devices, politicians will still cave to the power of ExxonMobil and their partners in crime.”For the package to win support from Democrats in Congress and from the Obama administration, it had to include extensions of tax credits for wind and solar power as well. The administration has said it opposes liberalisation of crude exports, but President Barack Obama is not expected to veto the bill on those grounds.US oil output has been in retreat since a peak of 9.6m barrels per day in April as producers slashing drilling campaigns in response to the plunge in crude prices. It is not clear that life without an export ban will do much to stimulate additional production, as the oil industry and environmentalists have argued. Under its reference case, Energy Information Administration economists concluded that allowing unfettered exports would not add any barrels of production by 2025.Jim Burkhard, vice-president of IHS, a consultant, says lifting the export ban would nevertheless embolden producers as they ponder future investment.“For US crude oil producer, that would remove a layer of uncertainty about price,” he says. “It would be a boost to confidence.”Additional reporting by Barney Jopson in Washington
6;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2015-11-25T17:43:49Z;US ethanol output tops 1m barrels a day;Refiners benefit from low corn prices and motorists returning to American highways;US ethanol output has topped 1m barrels a day for the first time as refiners take advantage of low corn prices and a caravan of motorists returning to American highways.The surge in supply shows how US ethanol plants, which mash corn into fuel and animal feed, have staggered back to life after being wounded by the financial crisis and then a historic drought.The ethanol industry has benefited as an improving jobs market and low oil prices prompt Americans to drive more. Travel on US roads rose 4.3 per cent in September to nearly 260bn vehicle miles compared with the same month last year, according to the Department of Transportation.As petrol consumption increases, so has demand for the ethanol that is blended into virtually every barrel sold. Department of Energy data released on Wednesday showed US ethanol plant output at 1.008m barrels per day in the week ended November 20, up 33,000 b/d from the week before and more than triple volumes of a decade ago. The US is the world’s largest ethanol producer, followed by Brazil.The growth comes despite uncertainty over US biofuels blending mandates. The Environmental Protection Agency in May proposed a plan that mandates less ethanol use than originally outlined in a 2007 law. The federal agency is expected to modestly increase these levels in a final rule to be released by November 30, Reuters reported.Ethanol producers, led by companies such as Poet, Archer Daniels Midland, Green Plains and Valero Energy, the last also an oil refiner, have expanded facilities in response to demand.Alex Thomas, trader and analyst at Vectra Capital in New York, said: “They’ve increased capacity steadily over the years. Some of that was masked in 2012 and 2013 with the drought we had in the Midwest — you had some plants shutting down because we ran out of corn. This is the first time that you’ve had enough corn, enough capacity and enough demand that they can produce that much.”4.3%rise in travel on US roads in September to nearly 260bn vehicle milesCompetition among ethanol plants has squeezed profit margins for ethanol producers. Iowa State University estimated recent returns over operating costs of just 11 cents per gallon at a typical plant in the state, down 60 per cent from the start of the year.Chicago ethanol prices were $1.5025 a gallon on Wednesday, off 0.2 per cent on the day and down 35 per cent from a year before.New York-listed ADM told analysts earlier this month: “We continue to confront very weak industry ethanol margins.”The high production inflated US ethanol stocks to 19.6m barrels last week, up 15 per cent from a year ago, according to the Department of Energy.
7;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2015-04-14T17:05:02Z;US close to ending era as net importer of energy;America to enjoy surplus for first time since 1950s thanks to abundant domestic fuel and efficiencies;The US is poised to cease being a net importer of energy for the first time since the 1950s as abundant domestic fossil fuel and efficiency measures reset its relations with world suppliers, a government forecaster has said.The Energy Information Administration’s annual energy outlook found that net energy imports would fall to zero by 2028 under its base case — or in just four years if oil prices or resources sharply exceeded expectations.The annual outlook was the agency’s first since oil markets began to collapse last year, dragging prices to six-year lows. In its base case, Brent crude would remain below $80 per barrel until 2020, well below its projection a year ago. The international oil marker was $58.72 per barrel on Tuesday, up 1.4 per cent.Companies have begun to export some of the US energy bounty despite restrictions, such as a four-decade-old ban on crude oil exports. Cheniere Energy plans to begin liquefying US natural gas for export at a Louisiana terminal this year.Oil refiners such as Valero are exporting record amounts of refined oil products such as diesel, while BHP Billiton and other producers have begun to export ultralight condensate oil after the White House loosened the crude export ban.The US energy trade deficit has shrunk by 54 per cent from a peak of $416bn in 2008.Adam Sieminski, EIA administrator, said: “With continued growth in oil and natural gas production, growth in the use of renewables, and the application of demand-side efficiencies, the projections show the potential to eliminate net US energy imports in the 2020 to 2030 timeframe.”Because of refineries’ appetite for crude oil, the US continues to be a large net importer of oil with volumes of nearly 5m barrels per day. Under two scenarios with higher oil prices or higher resources, EIA said the US would become a net petroleum exporter in 2021.US drillers have idled rigs in response to falling oil prices, leading to expectations that US crude production will level off this year. But in the longer term the EIA eyed “continued strong growth in domestic production in crude oil” from shale formations until 2020.The outlook for resilient production was echoed on Tuesday by the International Monetary Fund, which examined the effects of lower prices in its World Economic Outlook. It found that a 1 per cent reduction in oil investment was associated with a 0.4 per cent decline in production from prevailing trends, but only after five years.“Growth in oil production is not expected to slow significantly in the short term as a result of the recent oil price slump,” the IMF said.
8;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2014-12-03T09:02:58Z;US refineries run flat out to process cheap crude;The US industry takes advantage of falling oil prices and a flood of shale supply;"US highways grow visibly emptier as winter weather sets in. Traffic volumes decline, as does petrol consumption.Tell that to oil refiners. The US industry is processing record amounts of crude for this time of year, taking advantage of falling oil prices and a flood of supply from shale drillers. “They’re running refineries as hard as they can,” says John Auers, executive vice-president at Turner Mason, an energy consultancy in Dallas.Refineries’ hearty appetite has kept the price of high-quality “light” US crude closely in line with international prices, defying warnings that a glut would force deep discounts. Light Louisiana Sweet, the US Gulf coast benchmark, this week sold for just a dollar less than the international Brent benchmark, suggesting solid demand for it.Government policy has also helped maintain strong crude runs, emboldening refiners who argue that Washington should keep in place longstanding restrictions on oil exports. Under a four-decade-old law, shippers are free to export refined petroleum products but not crude.“The bottom line remains that we haven’t seen an oversupply of light crude,” says Jamal Kheiry, spokesman for Marathon Petroleum, an independent US refining company. “We believe the industry will continue to make investments and keep up with increased production.”The amount of oil purchased by refiners in the US will be an important guide for world oil markets, which have cut prices to $70 a barrel because of surging output in the US and the Opec cartel’s unwillingness to cut production. Refiners are by far the dominant customers for crude, which is largely unusable unless processed.In the week to November 28 gross inputs to US refinery distillation units were 16.554m barrels a day, the highest figure for any November week on record, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Refineries ran at 93 per cent of capacity.16.554mGross inputs (of barrels per day) to US refinery distillation units in the week to November 28 – the highest figure for any November week on recordThe US refining system has several advantages over competitors shuttling fuel around the Atlantic Ocean, says James Fallon, a director at the consultancy IHS. The first is access to cheap natural gas used to power refineries’ energy-intensive operations.The second is that US refiners can buy crude at a price cheaper than many global rivals, thanks to production increases from shale and rising imports of heavier oil from Canada.Third, many US refineries are close to docks that allow them to sell freely abroad. Net exports of refined petroleum products now total 2m b/d, a reversal of the US’s historic role as an importer.Domestic demand for fuel has been tepid since the financial crisis, but that is also now set to change. The winter slowdown notwithstanding, drivers are returning to roads in numbers last seen in 2008 and are again buying gas-guzzling vehicles.“The F150s [a Ford pickup model] and the SUVs are flying out of the dealers’ showrooms these days,” says Charlie Drevna, president of American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a refiner industry group. “You can’t put the spouse, the Rottweiler, the hockey equipment and the kids in a Smart car.”If production continues to grow . . . you will get to a day of reckoning when you can’t consume the crudeWhether US refineries and their neighbours in Canada – which is exempt from crude export restrictions – succeed in absorbing the rising oil tide is a preoccupation for oil traders and analysts.US crude oil production surpassed 9m b/d in recent weeks. Next year, the Energy Information Administration forecasts output will average 9.42m b/d.“If production continues to grow and you still limit the ability to export crude, you will get to a day of reckoning when you can’t consume the crude,” Mr Auers says. He believes this day will dawn in the next year or two, when production tops 10m b/d.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingDebate over whether to allow unfettered exports of US crude has intensified this year. Recent studies, including those by the Brookings Institution and the US Government Accountability Office, found allowing exports could spur higher crude production at home, weaken oil prices abroad and in turn reduce petrol prices for US consumers, since they are mainly steered by international markets.Refiners are investing to take advantage of cheaper US shale oil and suggest they have the capacity to handle the rising volumes. For example Valero, the largest US refining company, plans to add crude units in Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas designed to process oil from the nearby Eagle Ford shale. Overall US refining capacity is about 17.8m b/d, up about 400,000 b/d from two years ago.“American refiners are doing a good job of handling all the domestic production,” Valero says."

However, once that oil has been refined into another fuel – such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel – it can leave the country.The news that oil producers could export a type of oil that is lighter than regular crude depressed shares of refiners and sent the S&P Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing Index to its biggest one-day decline since 2011.Valero tumbled 8.29 per cent to close at $51.35, Phillips 66 slumped 4.21 per cent to $81.36 and Marathon Petroleum fell 6.34 per cent to end at $80.97.Analysts with Wells Fargo warned that the sharp pullback could be overdone as condensate demand and the size of initial exports, which are expected to begin this summer, are unknown.“We recognise that this will shake confidence in the refining outlook but this is not the end of the road, in our opinion – just an anticipated bump,” analyst Roger Read said.“Unfettered crude exports will require an act of Congress and the political will for that is undeveloped at this point.”The decision lifted independent oil producers, including those drilling in Eagle Ford and Bakken shale of Texas and North Dakota.Shares of SM Energy rose just over 6 per cent to $84.96, Pioneer advanced 5.15 per cent to $233.07 and Rosetta Resources climbed 5.25 per cent to close at $53.69.US broadcast networks were boosted by a Supreme Court ruling that found streaming television service Aereo violated their copyright in a decision that safeguards a key revenue stream for the companies.Broadcast networks – including CBS, Fox, ABC and NBC – earn some $4bn a year from so-called retransmission fees from cable distribution companies like Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Dish.A win for Aereo would have allowed cable distributors to follow its model of using tiny antennas to capture over-the-air television and redistribute it for free.June 2014: Michael Mackenzie discusses with Gregory Meyer how sectarian violence in Iraq coupled with high oil consumption in the US may affect the markets.The retransmission fees, which research firm SNL Kagan forecasts will rise to $7bn in coming years, have become a backbone for revenue at the networks.CBS, which is the largest US standalone broadcast network, rose more than 6 per cent to $62.48.Walt Disney shares advanced 1.48 per cent to $83.90, Twenty-First Century Fox rose almost 2 per cent to $34.88 and Comcast, which owns NBC, climbed more than 1 per cent to $53.21.Shares of Monsanto, the world’s largest maker of genetically modified seeds, climbed just over 5 per cent to $126.73 after the company raised its full-year earnings forecast and said it planned a new two-year $10bn share buyback programme.The company also announced a goal of doubling annual earnings by 2019 on the back of strength in its core seeds business and new big data offerings.Barnes & Noble, the US bookseller fighting fires both in its brick-and-mortar and digital businesses, said on Wednesday that it will split its Nook and retail divisions into two separate companies.“We have determined that these businesses will have the best chance of optimising shareholder value if they are capitalised and operated separately,” chief executive Michael Huseby said.The split is expected to take place in the first few months of 2015. Its shares rose 5.3 per cent to $21.65. Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times, holds a minority stake in the Nook business.Overall, US equity markets advanced despite a report that showed economic activity contracted at a worse than expected 2.9 per cent rate in the first three months of the year.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.49 per cent to close at 1,959.53 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.29 per cent higher to 16,867.51. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.68 per cent to end the day at 4,379.76.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
10;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2014-01-12T17:37:54Z;Oil refiners: Sweet surrender;Crude export ban should be lifted along with other measures of energy protectionism;US oil production is about as fast these days as the US government is slow. Nevertheless, momentum is steadily building, both politically and commercially, to allow domestic crude to be marketed abroad. And it presents a good opportunity to review other regulations that distort the energy supply chain.The export ban, instituted in the days of the 1970s Arab oil embargo, has now created a market distortion where domestic crude prices have diverged from the global one. And that has been wonderful news for US refiners who acquire that cheap US crude and then sell refined products such as diesel around the world at prices set by that higher global level.US oil production is expected to grow to more than 9m barrels a day by 2015. Gulf Coast refiners such as Valero, Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 now benefit from the recent split between the falling Light Louisiana Sweet crude and the global Brent prices. JPMorgan believes there will be a medium-term gap of $10 between another US crude oil benchmark, WTI and Brent. The bank said last month that would boost the value of its US refiner universe by a third. Nice work if you can get it.So it is unsurprising that Valero and other refiners will oppose lifting the export ban (though others such as Phillips 66 are supportive). Supporters of the ban say it lowers prices at the pump. However, US petrol usage remains tepid while exports of refined products have rocketed to almost 3m barrels a day, double 2006 levels.So instead of vainly losing the fight on the crude exports, refiners would be wise to broach reform of the Jones Act, another form of protectionism. The Jones Act forces shipping between US ports to be handled by domestic vessels and crews. As such, refiners on the east coast face transport costs of perhaps double or triple what a foreign ship would command. If the refiners do not deserve favoured status from Uncle Sam, neither do shippers.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
11;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Oil groups in rush for US crude export licences;;"Oil companies are securing licences to export US crude at a frantic pace as the shale boom leads to swelling supplies along the Gulf of Mexico.The US government granted 103 licences to ship crude oil abroad in its latest fiscal year, up by more than half from the 66 approved in 2012 and the highest since at least 2006, according to data obtained by the Financial Times.All but a dozen of last year’s licences were to Canada, where companies may buy US crude as long as they refine it there.The clamour for licences is unexpected as Canada is the top foreign oil supplier to the US.But huge production gains in states such as Texas, coupled with restrictions on coastal tanker movements to US refineries, encourage traders to buy cheap Gulf coast crude and sell it in eastern Canada at higher global prices.Exports to Canada totalled 99,000 barrels per day in September, the latest official data show. Traders estimate flows have since risen to about 200,000 b/d, the highest in more than a decade.Valero, the biggest North American refiner, has received a licence to export Eagle Ford crude from Texas to its refinery in Quebec, eastern Canada. Irving Oil, which owns Canada’s biggest refinery, has been buying US crude delivered by vessel and railway. Trafigura, the trading house, said a subsidiary has held an export licence to Canada for years.More than 3.3m barrels of US crude have been exported to Canada from the Port of Corpus Christi in Texas in the 11 months to November, said Dennis DeVries, director of finance. Volume has jumped 10-fold from 2012.The shipments compete with production from Canada’s offshore Atlantic fields. Chile’s state oil company ENAP bought some of the displaced Canadian crude, traders said.US crude oil exports to markets outside Canada have been tightly controlled since 1975, when the country was reeling from the Arab oil embargo.Jake Dweck, partner at the Sutherland Asbill & Brennan law firm, said: “Companies, particularly traders, often obtain licences to make sure they have the option to act if the market opportunity arises. So some end up actually using their licences while others just sit on them.”The government data show the US Bureau of Industry and Security last year also issued two export licences apiece to China, Italy, Mexico and South Korea; three to Panama and one to Singapore.The bureau did not divulge the nature of these licences, and export data show that apart from Canada, only China has bought a modest 267,000 barrels in January. Licences are good for a year, Mr Dweck said.Traders and lawyers believed the licences were for the potential shipment of Canadian oil transiting through the US, for other foreign crudes temporarily parked inside the US as a way station or for Alaskan crude to be sold in Asia.Even as US crude exports remain restricted, domestic refineries may export unlimited quantities of products such as diesel and petrol. Canadian refineries using US crude can also ship products anywhere, including back to the US."
12;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2013-10-16T15:11:11Z;US oil refiner exports hit Europe rivals;;America’s refiners are exporting a shale revolution. And, in doing so, they are about to transform oil trading and the global refining industry.US oil output is soaring as crude gushes from shale fields such as the Bakken in North Dakota and Eagle Ford in Texas. But laws restrict the sale of that crude abroad. Instead, refineries on the Gulf Coast are converting crude into petrol, diesel and other products before shipping it to Europe, Africa and Latin America.As these US product exports pour into the global oil markets, European refineries are feeling the impact: their share of the oil products market is shrinking.Shipping routes that have delivered profits to traders for decades are disappearing, too. A shift from crude to product trading has accelerated.“The US is becoming a very major exporter,” Ian Taylor, chief executive of Vitol, one of the world’s largest oil traders, told the Oil and Money Conference this month. “Fundamentally [this is causing] huge change.”Before 2011 the US was a net importer of petroleum products. But since then cheap shale oil has encouraged refineries to process more crude, just as domestic demand for petrol has dwindled thanks to more efficient engines.As a result, in the first week of September, the US exported a net 1.7m barrels a day of products, according to the US government, almost equal to Nigeria’s crude oil production. And these exports are now finding markets in Europe, Latin America and Africa, where they are often cheaper than alternatives.As well as cheap crude, US refiners can use cheap shale gas to power their operations and they operate under looser environmental regulations than European rivals. “US refiners . . . have higher utilisation due to structural advantages,” Valero, a US refining company said in a recent investor presentation.The weight of such a large volume of cheap product is bearing down on a number of markets.The clearest effect is on the transatlantic products trade. For decades European refineries have sent excess gasoline to the US east coast, while diesel flowed in the opposite direction to power the more fuel-efficient engines of European cars.But now one leg of that trade is shrinking as the US has less need for European gasoline. Tankers are having to sail across the Atlantic empty to pick up diesel for Europe, which is unwelcome for the traders who charter them.“It used to be that you could move surplus gasoline from Europe to the US, bring back some diesel, and think you were a clever guy, but life for the gasoline trader is getting tougher,” says one senior trader.As European refiners look further afield to sell their products, sending gasoline into Asia, for example, that is having knock-on effects in other markets.Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, the Gulf state’s national oil company, last week cut sharply its sale price for naphtha, a petrochemical feedstock, according to Reuters, amid growing competition from European supplies in the region.“As more US products enter the market, other refiners are having to work harder and harder to get rid of their surplus products,” says Jonathan Leitch, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie.Yet, the surge in US exports is only one element in a wider shift towards oil products trading. Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia are eyeing increased sales, after investing heavily in domestic refining capacity. The International Energy Agency is forecasting global trade in products will rise sharply over the next five years at the expense of trade in crude oil.At the same time, shipyards are seeing more orders for product tankers. Vitol took delivery of its first product carriers earlier this year, and more than 100 medium-range vessels are expected to be delivered next year, according to data from shipping brokers.European refiners are likely to be the main losers from increased Gulf refining capacity. As Gulf states import less diesel, the giant Indian refineries owned by Reliance and Essar are increasingly eyeing sales in the European market.“Europe is like a sieve. Everyone is dumping their excess products here,” says Amrita Sen at Energy Aspects in London.Torbjörn Törnqvist, chief executive of Gunvor, a commodity trading house, expects 500,000 to 700,000 barrels a day of refining capacity to close in Europe within two years to balance the market.That could be a relief for Gunvor and Vitol, which moved into the refining business last year, buying assets at rock-bottom prices when Swiss refiner Petroplus went bankrupt. They are now exposed to falling demand for products.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer
13;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2013-10-10T23:12:53Z;US eyes cutting ethanol usage;;The US would ratchet back its ethanol consumption mandate for the first time under a proposal that would ease costs for oil refiners and cool demand for farmers’ corn.The White House is considering a plan to require 15.21bn gallons of ethanol and biodiesel to be blended into motor fuels next year, well below the 18.15bn mandate dictated by Congress.The proposal, outlined in draft documents seen by the Financial Times, comes almost six years after lawmakers passed the mandate in an attempt to wean the US from foreign oil and back income for corn belt states.This policy crashed into the unexpected reality of weaker fuel consumption and an oil industry reluctant to sell petrol containing more than 10 per cent ethanol, making the targets unachievable in a problem known as the “blend wall”.The Environmental Protection Agency’s preferred option would hit not only Brazilian sugarcane growers, who export ethanol to the US, but for the first time cut required volumes of ethanol refined from corn. Less than 13bn gallons of corn ethanol would have to be sold under the draft proposal, below levels in force in the past two years and well below the 14.4bn statutory mandate for 2014.This would hit US ethanol refiners, such as Archer Daniels Midland and Poet as well as the farmers who sell them 35 per cent of the nation’s corn crop.EPA has sent its draft proposal to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review and has not released it for public comment. The agency, largely closed owing to the federal government shutdown, did not respond to requests for comment.A September 6 document indicates EPA plans to invoke powers to declare “inadequate domestic supply” as a way to justify the deviation from the congressional mandate. The Renewable Fuels Association, a biofuels lobby group, said this would be “patently unlawful”.“There is no basis to suggest that the strict criteria for a general waiver are met today,” said Bob Dinneen, RFA president.The renewable fuel and oil sectors have been at war with one another over the biofuels mandate, even as fuel retailers need some ethanol to meet emissions and octane requirements.Oil refiners’ shares responded positively to reports of the proposal. Valero, which also runs ethanol plants, closed 4.7 per cent higher, while HollyFrontier was up 6.1 per cent, Marathon was up 5.2 per cent and Phillips 66 was up 2.9 per cent.The American Petroleum Institute argues that the law’s requirements should be waived for next year on the grounds that because of the limit to ethanol use set by the blend wall, the mandate would cause “severe economic harm,” including “significant increases in the cost of fuel and substantial fuel supply shortages in the United States”.Patrick Kelly of the API said if the reported EPA proposals were confirmed, “directionally they’re doing the right thing, although we just think they could have gone a little further”.Jason Bordoff of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy said that if the figures were confirmed, he would expect a sharp fall in the price of the biofuels credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers, used by fuel suppliers to meet their regulatory obligations.“This potential reduction is more than what many in the market were expecting,” he said. “Industry could comply with these renewable fuel obligations without the incentive of a high RIN price to build out E85 infrastructure or produce more biomass-based diesel.”
14;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2013-04-29T19:55:44Z;US crude oil exports rise sharply;;US crude oil exports are flowing at the fastest rate in more than a decade in the latest sign of how the shale revolution is redrawing the world energy map.Foreign-bound shipments of US crude totalled 124,000 barrels per day in February, matching levels last reached in 2000, the US Department of Energy revealed in monthly data. All the exports went to Canada, the only destination where approval for exports is almost automatic under US lawThe rapid rise will intensify debates over whether the US should loosen export restrictions. Growth in US crude exports could also strengthen environmental opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, the project that would bring crude from the Canada’s tar sands to the central US.The shale drilling boom in states such as North Dakota and Texas has yielded a bounty of high-quality, low-sulphur crude that is ill-suited for many US refineries designed to process “sour” oils. Crude imports from Canada, a key supplier of “sour” barrels, hit an all-time high of 2.8m b/d in February, even as US imports overall dropped to a 17-year-low of 7.3m b/d.Canadian refiners such as Irving Oil have quickly added US shale oil to their menu of crude supplies. Irving has been buying crude delivered by rail from North Dakota to New York state, then sailing it to its refinery in Saint John, New Brunswick.Royal Dutch Shell is moving 50,000 b/d of Louisiana light crude to a refinery in Newfoundland province, according to Clipper Data. Valero, the biggest independent US refiner, has an export licence to bring Texas crude to its refinery in Quebec.Exporting US crude to Canada can make more economic sense in some cases than shipping it by vessel to US east coast refineries that rely on high-quality oil types. The Jones Act, a 1920 law, requires more expensive US-flagged vessels for travel between domestic ports.Valero estimated it costs $5-$6 a barrel to ship crude from the Gulf of Mexico to the US east coast but only $2 to ship to Canada’s east coast on a foreign-flagged vessel.Robert McNally, president of consultants Rapidan Group and a former White House energy official, said that while exports to Canada were routine, “any non-Canada export permit request will likely quickly get noticed and attract controversy”.In January, US data showed a small amount of crude exported to China but the oil was likely to have been extracted in a foreign country, imported to the US and then shipped on to China, the Energy Information Administration said. Such “re-exports” are legal.
15;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2013-03-17T18:09:27Z;US refiners count cost of ethanol credits;;The US refining industry’s lustre is dimming with investors as it faces billions of dollars in new costs related to biofuels policy.Shares of companies such as Valero Energy, HollyFrontier and PBF Energy have fallen amid worries about their exposure to the surging cost of credits used to comply with ethanol and biodiesel mandates. Refiners have been among the strongest US stocks in the past year.“We find it frustrating that an ancillary issue related to a mandated government programme that has essentially nothing to do with fundamentals is threatening to derail the bull run on the refiners,” said Chi Chow, analyst at Macquarie.US law requires refiners and wholesalers to blend increasing amounts of biofuels each year into the petrol they sell. They can also buy credits as a substitute for meeting blending obligations.The credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, topped $1 early last week after a rise of almost 2,000 per cent in 2013. This will cost the refining industry $7bn this year, estimates Paul Cheng, analyst at Barclays.Shares in Valero, the biggest independent with 16 refineries, have declined 5.3 per cent in the past two weeks. The company also owns 10 ethanol plants but on the whole needs to buy RINs to satisfy blending obligations.Mr Chow said Valero’s RIN obligations would cost nearly $900m this year. The company sells heavy volumes of unblended gasoline, he said as he downgraded the stock last week.The extent to which refiners and importers or consumers will pay the price of surging RIN costs is the subject of debate. Mr Cheng said most costs will be passed through at the pump, generating a net gain for the refining industry.Jack Lipinski, chief executive of CVR Energy, with two refineries in Kansas and Oklahoma, told analysts: “There is no way that the RINs cost will not get passed on”. CVR shares have fallen 5 per cent in the past two weeks.The biofuels industry argues that drivers would save money if oil companies funnelled more biofuels into their blends. Fuel companies in most cases refuse to blend more than 10 per cent ethanol into finished petrol, citing liability concerns.Bob Dineen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said: “Ethanol is cheaper than gasoline, and refiners should be using more ethanol, not less ethanol.”The risks of high RIN prices are not equally shared. Chevron, which owns five US refineries, last week said it blends more fuels than it refines, making it “a seller of RINs into this market”.“So as a company we’re not in a particularly vulnerable position on this today, but I will tell you that this is a regulation that just doesn’t work,” Mike Wirth, executive vice-president, said.
16;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2013-03-12T17:37:24Z;US equities step back from all-time highs;;US stocks retreated from multiyear highs on Tuesday with the leading US benchmark snapping a seven-day winning streak as investors looked to take profits.The S&P 500, which had been approaching all-time record levels during its multi-day run, fell 0.2 per cent to 1,552.48 New York.Defensive sectors, led by telecoms and healthcare, were among the few rising industry groups on the benchmark, while those more closely tied to the global economy cooled.“We’ve been up so many days in a row that we were due for some profit-taking,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. Meanwhile, the CBOE Vix index, a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500 and a gauge for investor nerves, rose 6.1 per cent to 12.34 after touching a six-year low a day earlier.“On a normal day, a jump in the Vix like this would definitely catch your attention, but considering where we are coming from it should be expected,” Mr Kinahan added.Shares in Yum! Brands were among the best performing stocks on the benchmark to start the day after the fast-food chain operator said its business in China picked up in February.The company, which operates fast-food restaurants such as KFC and Taco Bell, gained as much as 5.4 per cent in early morning trading. Its shares closed 1.3 per cent higher to $68.73.Jefferies’ analyst Andy Barish said the stock, which trades at a multiple of 23 times its forward earnings forecast for 2013, was fairly valued despite the better-than-expected sales results.Meanwhile, Costco rose 1.3 per cent to $103.75 as the wholesale retailer said higher membership fees helped it beat analysts’ forecasts for its latest quarterly profits. The company also reported a pick-up in market share against its competitors, including Walmart. Shares in Walmart were 0.9 per cent higher at $73.60.JC Penney, a US department store chain, climbed 4 per cent to $15.65 as it moved to deny market rumours that its chief executive was planning to step down amid the company’s troubles.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.3 per cent to 3,242.32, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished fractionally higher to 14,450.06.Boeing, the US aircraft manufacturer and Dow component, rose 0.9 per cent to $83.70 as reports said the company had received a 200 jet order from budget airline operator Ryanair Holdings.Shares in computer product maker Hewlett-Packard were 1.8 per cent higher to $21.40 as the UK’s Serious Fraud Office said it had launched an investigation into Autonomy, the software maker, acquired by the company for $11bn in 2011.The S&P 500 energy sector index was 0.1 per cent higher as benchmark crude prices rose.Refiners including Valero Energy, which gained 4.2 per cent to $45.55, pared some of their losses after a recent sell-off.Heading into Tuesday’s trade, analysts at Barclays said the ten largest publicly traded independent refiners had lost a total market value of $5bn. They added that the declines may be due to investor concerns over the impact of an increase in biofuel prices.Google lost 0.9 per cent to $827.61 as the internet search and advertising company agreed to pay $7m in a settlement with 38 US states for violating privacy rights.VeriFone rose 6 per cent to $21.68 a day after the electronics payments services company said its longstanding chief executive would step down. The company, which has lost 27 per cent from the start of the year, recently acknowledged that it had struggled in shifting from hardware-based business into software services.John Williams, analyst at UBS, said the management change should be a reason for investors to reconsider its shares: “Investors who were uncomfortable with management may not take a fresh look.”
17;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2013-03-11T19:22:03Z;Oil groups warn of biofuel risk to prices;;Spectacular moves in an obscure biofuel market threaten to lead to higher US petrol prices and even localised shortages in regions bruised by fuel queues after superstorm Sandy, the oil industry has warned.Fuel suppliers say they might export more petrol, or reduce US imports, as the surging price of credits certifying compliance with Washington’s renewable fuel mandate raises their cost of selling petroleum products.US federal law requires refiners and wholesalers to blend increasing amounts of biofuels each year into the petrol they sell. They can also buy credits as a substitute for meeting blending obligations. The credits are generated when biofuels are produced.The price of these credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers, has jumped 20-fold to records this year as traders fear that stocks will be exhausted by 2014. Ethanol credits breached $1 last week, up from 5.25 cents on December 31, according to Argus Media. More than 12bn ethanol RINs will be created this year.RINs have become the latest flash point in debates over the US renewable fuel standard, a mandate amended by Congress in 2007 and expected to require the sale of 13.8bn gallons of corn-based ethanol this year. The Environmental Protection Agency last year denied requests to waive the standard after drought decimated corn crops, the feedstock for most US ethanol.Ethanol sales have lagged behind mandated blending volumes because overall US petrol demand is weak and oil companies are reluctant to mix more than 10 per cent ethanol into each gallon, capping consumption.The widening divergence between the mandates and consumption means oil companies are fast depleting their RIN stocks.Traders say that if the RIN supply runs out they might stop importing petrol. Atlantic coast cities such as Boston and New York depend on inbound shipments from Canada, Europe and the central US.Patrick Kelly, senior policy adviser to the American Petroleum Institute industry lobby, said: “What the high RIN price does to the industry as a whole is disincentivise imports and additional production and incentivise exporting finished products.”Valero, the biggest independent US refiner, said: “If RIN prices stay elevated like this, eventually that will be reflected in the price at the pump and people in areas that are short refining capacity will notice it first.”The biofuels industry argues that any RIN shortfall could be remedied by installing pumps that deliver more ethanol-rich blends.Geoff Cooper, director of research at the Renewable Fuels Association, said: “To hear some oil companies tell it …this ‘blend wall’ is impenetrable. That is not the case. There are legal options available that the right RIN price is going to drive the market towards.”
18;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2013-03-11T16:02:40Z;Cut in fuel use reignites ethanol debate;;"“Wow, I’m going to double-check that number, it’s crazy,” exclaims Jeff Hove as instant messages flash up on his computer screen.The number on his screen, though, is correct: the price of a critical US biofuel credit has just breached $1. for the first time, after soaring 1,900 per cent this yearLast week’s price move has turned a little-noticed backwater of the energy markets into a near-obsession for dealers such as Mr Hove, in the US corn belt, to energy trading desks in Houston, London and Geneva. Some are getting burnt.The market is in “Renewable Identification Numbers”, or RINs. These 38-digit codes are at the heart America’s experiment with “green” fuels. As Washington requires more ethanol and biodiesel to be mixed into motor fuel, oil refiners and importers that fail to meet minimum targets have an alternative. They can buy excess RINs, which biofuel producers generate with each gallon they make, and claim them as credits.The sharp rise in RIN prices this year shows what happens when policy clashes with the realities of supply and demand. In 2007, Congress passed a law requiring more and more gallons of biofuels be sold each year. But fuel consumption has fallen, limiting how much ethanol can be blended with petrol.“People are driving less,” says Mr Hove, who sells RINs at RINAlliance in Des Moines. “But the volume of renewable fuels required out there is still growing.”Until recently there were plenty of RIN credits to close the gap between the government-mandated and actual ethanol use. Excess RINs totalled 2.6bn gallon-equivalents at the end of 2012.But last year the industry used 400m more RINs than were generated, the University of Missouri’s Food
and Agricultural Policy Research Institute estimates. This year, the deficit will more than treble to 1.35bn. Absent a change of heart in Washington, or a surprise increase in ethanol blending, stocks of credits are likely to fall to zero sometime next year.“In 2014, the RIN bank is insolvent,” says Andy Lipow, head of consultants Lipow Oil Associates.Ethanol mandates have worried agricultural markets for years as they swallowed more of the corn crop, but fears of a rise in grain prices have eased. “With flat or declining gasoline consumption, there’s a real question of how fast higher penetration rates will occur,” says Joseph Glauber, chief economist
at the US Department of Agriculture.Now energy traders are growing nervous. Some are warning of fuel supply shortfalls on the US east coast, where drivers saw fuel rationing after superstorm Sandy.More than half the east coast’s petrol demand is met by imports or shipments from the Texas region. “Refiners could try to avoid the extremely high cost of RINs by moving more barrels out to export markets, where there is no RIN requirement,” says Valero, an independent refiner.“If that happens, you theoretically could see price increases at the pump, particularly and probably first in areas like the north-east.” Valero owns ethanol plants in addition to oil refineries.Amid the uncertainty, New York gasoline futures have gained 13 per cent this year, compared with modest declines in crude. Physical gasoline for May delivery in New York harbour on Monday hit a 25-cent per gallon premium to its Rotterdam equivalent, an eightfold increase from January, according to Geneva Energy Markets. The persistence of this arbitrage opportunity suggests would-be European exporters are deterred by the cost of RINs. Indeed, one oil veteran describes “blood everywhere” as wholesale gasoline traders grapple with a market they had once ignored.The biofuel industry says the RIN market is signalling that oil companies should raise standard petrol blends from the 10 per cent status quo, known as E10. The US Environmental Protection Agency has approved a mix of 15 per cent for newer cars, but the oil industry has balked, citing product liability concerns.“The truth is, the E10 ‘blend wall’ was erected by the oil companies themselves, and it is little more than a convenient excuse for their refusal to move to higher-level ethanol blends,” Bob Dineen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, wrote last week.As US ethanol production took off in the past five years, the “food versus fuel” debate took centre stage as policy makers clashed over the wisdom of converting crops to energy sources. Turmoil in the RIN market suggests the next debate will be “fuel versus fuel”, or ethanol versus petroleum. This will pitch some of the world’s biggest companies against each other."
19;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2013-02-08T17:08:34Z;US crude exports argument needs refining;;President Barack Obama wants to double US exports. Will these include crude oil?This question, absurd until recently, is becoming serious. The US may still be a huge crude importer but rises in domestic supplies are shutting out millions of foreign barrels. This week the head of the International Energy Agency – a group that looks after western nations’ energy security – pointedly warned the US oil boom will end if Washington fails to lift its ban on most crude exports.And Lisa Murkowski, the senior Republican on the Senate energy and natural resources committee, declared: “All agencies should review policies affecting energy exports and remove unnecessary impediments. Energy exports are good for our economy.”The impending fight could overshadow current arguments over US exports of liquefied natural gas. Politicians, businesses inside and outside the energy industry and environmentalists will join the fray – with high stakes for investors.Exports would shuffle the boom’s winners and losers. Refiners, the weaklings of the oil patch a few years ago, have reaped windfalls buying oil at depressed US prices and processing fuel for sale at higher international prices. In the past two years the S&P 500 refining and marketing index, composed of stocks such as Valero and Marathon Petroleum, had total returns of 90 per cent.The companies drilling the oil have not been so fortunate. Daily US crude production has risen by 1.3m barrels in the past two years, reaching a 19-year high of 6.9m barrels a day. Yet shares of exploration and production companies lost 2.4 per cent.Most new output is high-quality, low-sulphur crude from states such as North Dakota and Texas. Many US refineries are set up to process heavier, lower-quality crude. Others sit far from pipelines so can be served only by costly trains and US-flagged tankers.“It may make sense to export a certain type of oil that you don’t have refinery capacity in a locality to be able to use,” says John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying group whose members include Chevron and Exxon Mobil.Refiners see it differently. They say they are adjusting to handle the new supplies. At Valero, high-quality sweet crude used to be a third of its feedstock, a spokesman says. Now it’s about half. To capture some of the stunning output from the Eagle Ford shale in Texas, Valero built a truck terminal at its nearby Three Rivers refinery. It plans to buy 2,000 railway tank cars this year to collect more cheap inland crude.It has also received permission to export some US crude to a Valero refinery in Quebec, Canada. But the spokesman suggests untrammelled US exports would be a bad idea: “It actually makes more sense to keep the oil here and refine it at a low cost and then export products.” Valero has been central to the US’s emergence as a top global diesel and petrol exporter.Exports of crude are much more politically sensitive than products. Shipments are effectively blocked to everywhere but Canada. But the restrictions, which date to the late 1970s, were irrelevant until now.Maria van der Hoeven, IEA executive director, argued in the Financial Times that the US needs to loosen export restrictions lest weak oil prices force drillers to give up on exploration.This seems improbable. Producers in North Dakota have found customers in states as far away as New Jersey despite high delivery costs. An easier fix to the refinery mismatch might be to let cheaper foreign tankers carry oil to the east coast.Further, environmentalists will argue, selling extra light crude abroad will simply feed demand for the heavier – and from a global warming perspective, more dangerous – oil poised to flow on the proposed Keystone XL pipeline from Canada.But there is another reason why enabling crude export makes sense, says Bill Reinsch, former undersecretary for export administration at the US Department of Commerce. The US is leaning on allies to stop buying Iranian crude amid sanctions over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme. “It’s hard to tell them, ‘Don’t buy from Iran,’ and then deny them an alternative source,” Mr Reinsch says.The arguments are still at a crude stage. Expect sharp refinements.gregory.meyer@ft.com
20;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2013-01-27T18:56:42Z;Refiners reap gains of US shale oil boom;;The US refining industry has been enjoying a remarkable revival thanks to the shale boom, making shares in companies such as Marathon Petroleum and Tesoro the best-performing of any large energy companies worldwide last year.In a sign of how shale oil and gas production is reshaping the global industrial landscape, refining has become more internationally competitive in the US, enabling it to export record volumes of oil products such as diesel fuel.An analysis published on Monday by PFC Energy, a consultancy, shows that in 2012 shares in US refiners rose by between 57 and 105 per cent, making their strongest recoveries since the collapse in oil prices and refining profit margins in 2008-09.The leading US refiners report full-year results this week and they are all expected to report strong gains with analysts forecasting earnings per share up 40 per cent at Valero Energy, 44 per cent at Tesoro and 63 per cent at Marathon Petroleum.The foundation for the revival in US refining has been the shale oil boom, made possible by advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing that have unlocked previously inaccessible reserves.Onshore production in states led by North Dakota and Texas has opened a wide gap between prices for inland US oil and internationally traded crude.On Friday night, international benchmark Brent crude was about $113 per barrel while US West Texas Intermediate at Cushing, Oklahoma, was about $96 and at Midland in west Texas was cheaper again at about $88.Refiners that can secure supplies of those cheaper crudes have a competitive advantage, both increasing their margins in the US and making them more competitive in export markets, particularly in emerging economies such as Mexico where – unlike in the US – fuel demand is still growing.“The entire structure of the US refining industry has been turned on its head,” says Robin West, of PFC. “Up until recently, oil was imported, refined on the coast and then transported inland. Now the crude is being produced inland and sent to the coasts and it’s a goldmine for the refineries that have access to it.”Inland refineries closer to the new production have been the principal beneficiaries. Shares in Dallas-based HollyFrontier, which has refineries in Kansas, Wyoming, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah, more than doubled last year.However, coastal refineries have also been able to secure cheaper supplies, sometimes by reversing the flows of pipelines – as with the Seaway pipeline which once took oil from Texas to Cushing but now goes the other way– or by moving oil on trains.Phillips 66, the refining, pipelines and chemicals group spun off from ConocoPhillips, said last year it was planning to buy up to 2,000 rail tank cars to take cheaper inland crude to its refineries on the coastThe wider distribution of cheap crude has meant that even Valero, which has half of its refineries in the Gulf of Mexico region, has benefited.US refiners have also been helped by the cheap price of natural gas – another result of the shale boom – which is a big input cost for refineries.Problems including the fire at Chevron’s Richmond refinery in California and an accident at new facilities owned by Royal Dutch Shell and Saudi Aramco at Port Arthur, Texas, also helped by keeping capacity out of the market.US refiners’ shares have not generally regained their peaks in the boom of the mid-2000s, sometimes known as “the golden age of refining”.From their highs in 2007, Tesoro’s shares are down about 30 per cent while Valero’s are down 50 per cent.Set against a patchy performance for the global energy industry last year, however, their record is particularly impressive.PFC’s analysis of the world’s 50 largest energy companies by market capitalisation shows shares in the US companies producing shale oil and gas had a mixed year, hit by weak natural gas prices.EOG’s shares rose 20 per cent but Devon’s fell 18 per cent. The largest western oil groups’ shares were flat or down slightly while national champions PetroChina and Gazprom were down 7 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively.With the US oil boom continuing, the refining industry’s strength seems set to continue, for a year or two at least.However, Mr West warns that, as new refining capacity comes on stream, profitability will come under pressure.Chi Chow, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, agrees. “There are eight new hydro-crackers for diesel planned to come on stream in the US and Europe,” he says.“You’re going to see the tight supply-demand balance that there has been for diesel start to loosen. Margins will flatten and potentially start to decline.”In this perennially cyclical industry, even if the shale boom persists, the boost it gives to refiners may not last too much longer.

It has lost 1.9 per cent this week.The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent lower at 12,938.11, and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.9 per cent to 2,960.31.Chris Krueger, senior policy analyst at Guggenheim Securities, warned his clients not to expect much from a meeting on Friday afternoon between Congressional leaders and President Barack Obama at the White House. The market appeared to agree, accelerating lower in the final 25 minutes of trading, as the talks got under way.“This meeting is more about optics than anything and likely represents the last chance for a deal,” Mr Krueger said. “The undercard for the day is the continued blame game that reached new highs on Thursday with the Congressional leaders throwing verbal haymakers at one another throughout the day.”Energy, materials and consumer discretionary stocks were the weakest, amid concern that a stumble in the US economy could hit global growth and domestic consumer spending.The energy sector was down 1.8 per cent in Friday trading and 4.1 per cent on the week. Notable casualties were Valero Energy, down 2.2 per cent at $33.10, and Anadarko Petroleum, off 2.0 per cent at $72.31. ExxonMobil shed 2.0 per cent to trade at $85.10.Markets, however, were hardly in crisis mode, even with the possibility that the January 1 cliff deadline will not be met. The Vix index, which measures volatility in the options market, rose above 21 to its highest level in five months, but that is still less than half the level it reached in August 2011 when politicians threatened to default on US government debt in the last budget showdown.The US government will not hit its debt ceiling again until around the end of February, giving potentially two more months of room for negotiations on a comprehensive tax and spending deal.A trading update from United Continental pushed the airline’s stock down 0.7 per cent to $23.04. Though passenger loads on domestic and international flights were both up, superstorm Sandy had hurt capacity, it said.Hewlett-Packard, the computer maker, was the worst performer in the Dow, off 2.6 per cent at $13.68 after it confirmed the Department of Justice was investigating allegations of fraud against the former management of its Autonomy division.Barnes & Noble shares jumped 4.3 per cent to $14.97 after the bookseller said it would sell a 5 per cent stake in its Nook e-reader business to Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.Moves to avert a strike at US ports caused a turnround for the shares of Home Depot and Lowe’s, two big DIY retailers whose shipments could have been disrupted by the dispute. Home Depot reversed a 1.3 per cent fall to trade briefly in the black, though it settled at $60.65, down 0.7 per cent. Lowe’s was down 0.4 per cent to $34.98.LSI, the computer storage company, rose 0.1 per cent to $6.92. Its flash memory technology and wireless kit will be in demand in the coming year, Wunderlich Securities predicted, in a “buy” note.Lorillard was up 0.7 per cent to $115.35. Investors followed a tip that the company, which makes Newport cigarettes, could increase its dividend next year.The National Association of Realtors’ pending home sales index, released Thursday, showed activity up 9.8 per cent on a year ago and the prospect of a revival in the US housing market spurred shares in homebuilders, though even these succumbed to the late sell-off. Toll Brothers closed 0.4 per cent lower at $31.27, and PulteGroup was down 0.9 per cent at $17.60.
22;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Tight corn stocks curb ADM results;Losses on ethanol production and exports struggle;Low US corn stocks have hurt Archer Daniels Midland as the grain merchant and processor lost money on ethanol production and struggled to export the most widely used feed grain.The weaker results at ADM, which processed nearly 25m tonnes of corn last fiscal year making it the US’s largest corn processor, illustrate how widely depressed inventories of US corn have affected the agricultural sector. ADM’s storage silos and grain barge network are concentrated in the US, leaving it more vulnerable than some competitors to low supplies there.Corn prices have been elevated for the past year and recently soared to new records of about $8 a bushel. US stocks, close to record low levels, may decline further as drought ravages this year’s crop.Patricia Woertz, ADM’s chief executive, acknowledged the drought has led to discussion “about who experiences the pain associated with higher prices”.ADM’s net profit fell 25 per cent to $284m, or 43 cents per share, in its fourth quarter ended June 30. This compares with $381m or 58 cents per share a year earlier.The New York-listed company is one of the two largest US producers of corn-based ethanol, with capacity to refine 1.7bn gallons per year of the fuel additive. The company lost money producing ethanol as stocks are high, petrol demand is weak and the amount of corn left over from last year’s harvest has dwindled.The division that includes ethanol plants reported a $61m operating loss in the quarter, down from a $111m operating profit one year earlier. ADM recently closed one ethanol plant in North Dakota.“Industry supply exceeded demand,” said Juan Luciano, chief operating officer. “Margins continue to be extremely volatile, because as the industry is trying to reduce inventories, corn prices have been moving at the same time.”The weak results in ethanol mirror broader strains in the biofuels industry. Valero Energy, a US oil refiner and major ethanol producer, on Tuesday cited “rapidly rising corn prices and continued high inventories” as it reported negative ethanol profit margins.Mr Luciano called the US ethanol business, comprised of both listed companies such as ADM and small farmer co-operatives, a “relatively new industry that needs to mature and consolidate”.ADM’s agricultural services division, which buys, stores, transports and sells grains around the world, reported that operating profit fell 64 per cent to $123m as tight US corn stocks curbed export volumes.As it attempts to diversify its global footprint of grain origins and destinations, the company also said it plans to buy a port terminal in the Brazilian state of Pará and upgrade it to handle 3m tonnes per year of soyabeans and other crops as well as fertilisers.“This port will enhance ADM’s global reach, better connecting the Brazilian harvest to markets including Europe, the Middle East and even Asia,” said Valmor Schaffer, president of ADM South America.Shares in ADM closed 5.1 per cent lower at $26.09 in New York.
23;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2012-07-19T17:23:34Z;Soaring corn stirs up calls to curb ethanol;;The world is running short of corn. That is the message being delivered by the market, where on Thursday prices pushed above $8 a bushel for the first time.With no obvious abundance of international suppliers to make up for the drought-ravaged US corn crop and stocks close to record lows, traders and analysts believe demand must be pegged back.A reduction in demand “will be necessary to prevent cupboards going bare”, says Hussein Allidina, head of commodities research at Morgan Stanley.“Demand rationing”, as analysts call it, is already beginning to happen. The US Department of Agriculture last week lowered its estimate of how much corn will be used to feed livestock by 650m bushels, or 12 per cent. It also reduced its forecast for US exports by 300m bushels.But the biggest potential for a reduction in corn demand comes from the ethanol industry, which is using roughly 5bn bushels of corn, or nearly 40 per cent of the US corn crop, each year to make fuel for cars and animal feed.Already ethanol production, once seen as impervious to high prices, is waning as skyrocketing corn prices, weak gasoline demand and the expiry of subsidies hurt margins. US ethanol plants pumped out 33.7m gallons a day last week, the lowest volume since October 2009.In late June, Valero Energy temporarily closed two ethanol refineries in Indiana and Nebraska as local corn prices had shot too high to turn a profit. Each had the capacity to produce 120m gallons a year.“We let the local markets know when we shut the plants down that we weren’t going to be buying corn,” said a spokesman for Valero. Eight other Valero plants remain open. The company said it hoped to reopen the plants once the new corn crop was harvested in the fertile Midwest states.However, some demand is essentially guaranteed by the Renewable Fuel Standard, the congressional mandate that will require more than 13bn gallons of corn-based ethanol to be used in transport this year, regardless of the corn price.“One of the peculiarities of the ethanol mandate is that regardless of how dire the corn crop may be, ethanol always eats first,” says Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, which opposes ethanol subsidies.Some traders and analysts believe a decision by the US Environmental Protection Agency to waive the mandate could prevent a price spike as the US corn crop withers.“Politicians are all in denial,” says an executive at a commodity trading house. “They have to address the US ethanol programme – that’s the only way to tackle it. To take out big chunks of demand you need to take out the US ethanol programme.”That appears unlikely in an election year. Ethanol is a political hot potato in the US, with grain-producing states and some environmentalists lobbying for mandates.The Renewable Fuels Association, an industry group, points out that petitioners seeking a waiver must show unequivocally that the ethanol mandate would “severely harm the economy or environment of a state, a region, or the US”.“The mandates are strong,” says one senior trader. “Just if they announce that there may be a change of legislation – I think that will put the market limit down.”The EPA said: “We can’t speculate on waiver requests that we haven’t received.”There are also technical issues that could prevent a large-scale reduction in ethanol use. Metropolitan areas with dirty air such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles have to blend “oxygenates” into gasoline to improve car emissions. Since an earlier oxygenate called MTBE disappeared, the industry has been using ethanol, says Tom Kloza of the Oil Price Information Service.However, ethanol production may be pared back without waiving mandates.Tom Vilsack, the US agriculture secretary, said on Wednesday: “There’s no need to go to the EPA at this point in time based on the quantity of ethanol that’s currently in storage. There’s no problem in that area at this point in time.”US ethanol stocks are at 821m gallons, potentially enough to cover shortfalls from closed plants.Moreover, oil companies can meet ethanol mandates without using corn. In the event they are unable to use actual ethanol, they can use credits called renewable identification numbers that they have banked in previous years.RIN prices have shot up in recent weeks, perhaps reflecting demand from oil companies seeking to protect themselves in the event of an ethanol shortage.Further, the US has been exporting large amounts of ethanol as US petrol demand has flagged.Reduced ethanol demand may be enough, together with lower exports and a contraction in the meat industry, to balance the corn market.But while the USDA last week cut its estimates for corn and soyabean yields to 146 and 40.5 bushels an acre respectively, traders are already anticipating a further fall to 130-135 and 38-40 bushels an acre.If the corn and soyabean belts go without rain for another two to three weeks, traders say, even those numbers could be too high, putting a more dramatic price increase on the cards.
24;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2012-05-14T09:41:02Z;Attack of the zombie refineries;Oil refining spreads tightening as plants are relaunched;The process of creative destruction sweeping the oil refinery industry has gone from top gear into reverse.Over the past year, refiners in the Atlantic basin from ConocoPhillips in the US to Petroplus in Europe shut down plants, removing 1.6m barrels of capacity at the peak in January. The closures triggered a recovery in the refining margin between crude oil and oil products, known as crack spreads, a favourite market for hedge funds.But the refining business cycle is now turning full circle, with many of the mothballed plants restarting under new owners, again putting pressure on crack spreads.“The refining outlook has rapidly shifted from the mass closures seen at the start of the year to a mass of restarts over the coming months,” says Lawrence Eagles, head of oil research at JPMorgan in New York.Evan Calio, oil refining analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, puts it more graphically: “Like villains in horror movies, refineries are hard to kill.”The restart of some refineries comes with the arrival of a new class of owners – from trading houses to airlines and private equity groups – seeking bargains.Oil traders Vitol and Gunvor bought plants owned by the bankrupt Petroplus in Cressier (Switzerland) and Antwerp (Belgium) with refining capacity of 68,000 b/d and 100,000 b/d, respectively. Furthermore, two other Petroplus plants – the 162,000 b/d Petit Couronne in France and the 220,000 b/d Coryton in the UK – are still working through temporal agreements in spite of the parent’s insolvency.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines has purchased the 185,000 b/d Trainer refinery outside Philadelphia from Phillips 66, the refining business spun off from ConocoPhillips, as it seeks to hedge its raising jet fuel costs.Others are looking for further purchases. Carlyle, the private equity group, is in exclusive talks with Sunoco to buy a 330,000 b/d refinery in the Philadelphia area. And PetroChina has offered $350m for the 235,000 b/d Aruba refinery in the Caribbean owned by Valero.In total, about 1.3m b/d of refining capacity that was expected to be closed is now expected to return to the market.Earlier this year, closures boosted the traditional simple measure of margins, known as the 3:2:1 crack spread, significantly. In the US, it jumped to $26 a barrel, compared with a low point of $11 a barrel in early January and a five-year average of $14.7 a barrel. The restart of some refineries in the next few months could send crack spreads down againThe rapid turnround is raising eyebrows in the industry.The International Energy Agency, the western countries’ watchdog, summarised the view of many in the industry saying: “While the refinery purchases surely make sense for the new owners …, and the restarts are good for employment, they do nothing to address the fundamental overhang in capacity afflicting the OECD”.Of course, some closed refiners are unlikely to restart, supporting crack spreads. For example, the massive 350,000 refinery in St Croix, Virgin Islands – owned by Hovensa, a joint venture between Hess Corp. of the US and Petróleos de Venezuela – will probably be mothballed.Still, industry executives believe that more refineries will need to close this year to rebalance supply and demand, particularly as oil companies in Asia and the Middle East continue to invest in new capacity.“We believe there’s still too much refining capacity in the US and western Europe,” Bill Klesse, Valero chief executive said earlier this month during a conference call with investors. “Some things die hard,” he added.This article has been ammended since original publication to ccrrectly identify Antwerp as a Belgian city
25;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2012-05-07T17:37:12Z;Icahn wins right to buy CVR Energy;;Carl Icahn said on Monday he had won the right to buy CVR Energy after his tender offer gave him 69 per cent of a company that his bid values at $2.6bn.The activist investor began his bid for the oil refiner in February, first urging management to put the company up for sale, and then launching his $30-a-share tender offer.His majority stake will allow him to replace seven of the board’s nine members and proceed with plans to sell the company to a strategic buyer in the coming months. If the company is sold, shareholders who participate in the tender offer may receive an additional $7 a share.Mr Icahn has said strategic buyers could include Valero Energy, Conoco­Phillips, Western Refining, HollyFrontier, Tesoro and Marathon Petroleum, and that he will sell the company for a premium.It is not clear why strategic bidders have not yet emerged, with the company already in play. Mr Icahn also extended his offer for shareholders who have not tendered their shares until midnight on May 18, saying he would offer them $30 a share as well.Last month Mr Icahn said shareholders had tendered 55 per cent of the company’s outstanding shares. At that point CVR waived a poison-pill defence it had put in place after Mr Icahn revealed he had become the company’s largest holder with 14.5 per cent of shares.“We are pleased with the results of our tender offer and are excited to have CVR join the Icahn Enterprises family,” Mr Icahn said. “We look forward to working together with the CVR team.”Mr Icahn’s likely acquisition of CVR comes as a welcome victory after defeats last year. The veteran corporate raider proposed last year to buy bleachmaker Clorox and steelmaker Commercial Metals, but in both cases withdrew after failing to secure shareholder support or find alternative buyers.CVR, based in Sugar Land, Texas, operates oil refineries in Kansas and Oklahoma, and holds a majority stake in a fertiliser business. The location of its operations gives it access to lower crude prices than are available on the coasts.Mr Icahn also sold the $250m in debt he holds in LightSquared. The US wireless broadband company backed by Philip Falcone’s Harbinger Capital, is talking with creditors to avoid default.Last month, it missed a $29.6m debt payment, and in February the Federal Communications Commission withdrew its conditional approval for a proposed nationwide wireless network, saying it could interfere with navigation systems.That decision, along with financial troubles, led to talk that LightSquared might be forced to file for bankruptcy protection, a move that some thought could lead to Mr Icahn seizing control of the company.Additional reporting by Dan McCrum
26;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Icahn says investors support CVR bid;;A battle for control of CVR Energy is looming after Carl Icahn said shareholders had tendered about 55 per cent of the oil refiner’s outstanding shares to him in response to the corporate raider’s hostile bid.Mr Icahn, CVR’s largest shareholder with 14.5 per cent, said he would extend his $30 a share offer to buy it to the end of April.“I stand ready, willing and able to pay $2.26bn to purchase all CVR shares that I don’t currently own as soon as the board permits me to do so,” he said in a letter to CVR.The billionaire launched the bid in February, and has said that if successful, he would seek to sell the company on.But soon after he disclosed his stake and pushed the company to sell itself in January, CVR adopted a poison pill defence.If any investor gains ownership of more than 15 per cent of stock without approval, the board may issue equity to dilute the acquirer’s stake and stop them gaining control.CVR said Mr Icahn could not purchase any shares tendered in his offer and such shares could be withdrawn at any time.“The real choice for stockholders will be at our annual meeting [next month], where they will decide whether to elect Mr Icahn’s handpicked nominees in place of our qualified and experienced board,” it said.Mr Icahn said: “In light of the clear message that shareholders have now sent to the board, it would be a shame if the board took any action to thwart or delay our offer.” He has also threatened a proxy fight for control if CVR continues to rebuff his approach.CVR, based in Sugarland, Texas, owns oil refineries in Kansas and Oklahoma, as well as a majority stake in a fertiliser business.The location of the companies operations means that it has benefited from lower prices for crude in the Midwest than on the coast. Its shares closed up 6 per cent at $28.80. The stock is up more than 50 per cent so far this year.The $30 a share bid would value the company at $2.6bn. Mr Icahn has proposed to give shareholders as much as $7 a share on top of the initial offer if the company is sold, with possible trade buyers including Valero Energy, ConocoPhillips or Marathon Petroleum.

That comes ahead of the official monthly non-farm payroll report on Friday, which will be closely watched by markets.“The fundamentals in the market continue to surprise on the upside and beat expectations. Today’s ADP numbers add to that. There are two drivers in the market, primary are the fundamentals and global risk is a secondary consideration in our forecasts. Clearly, the attention is getting back on the fundamentals where it should be,” said Doug Coté, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management.He added: “We think this market continues to run. Friday’s non-farm payrolls are forecast at 210,000 but are we projecting 280,000.”The S&P 500 index had dropped 1.9 per cent on Monday and Tuesday as global economic growth concerns and Greek debt worries crept back into the markets, taking away investors’ appetite for risk.The US Treasury department late on Wednesday said it would sell $6bn in shares of AIG. Shares of the insurer that was rescued during the financial crisis in 2008 were down 1.2 per cent to $29.45 in after-hours trading.The financial sector led the S&P 500 during the day, closing up 1.3 per cent as Greece inched nearer to a successful debt restructuring agreement with private sector bondholders as a deadline approached. Morgan Stanley, the worst hit among the major banks earlier this week, rose 3.2 per cent to $17.88. Citigroup climbed 3.5 per cent to $33.24, Bank of America went up 4 per cent to $8.02 and Goldman Sachs rose 2.4 per cent to $116.40.After having spiked on Tuesday, investor expectations of volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, which is also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, dropped back below 20. The Vix was down 7.8 per cent to 19.25 points, but still has risen 13 per cent for the week.The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day up 0.9 per cent at 2,935.69. Apple – now the most owned stock by US mutual funds according to Citigroup – see-sawed throughout the day as Tim Cook, chief executive, unveiled the latest iterations of its popular products, including the iPad. Apple closed up 0.1 per cent at $530.69.Netflix, the video streaming and DVD delivery service, rose by up to 4 per cent after announcing it would enter into partnerships to stream content for cable companies. But the volatile shares in the company were sent down by as much as 4.3 per cent after Apple debuted the latest version of Apple TV in the afternoon. Netflix shares recovered a bit to close down 1.8 per cent at $105.19, as it assured customers that it services would be available on Apple TV.Pandora, the internet radio company, slumped 23.9 per cent to $10.86, erasing nearly all of its gains for the year. The company reported widening fourth-quarter losses compared to the same period a year ago and lowered future earnings guidance to below analyst consensus. Mark Mahaney, an internet analyst at Citi, downgraded the shares to “neutral”.“We initiated [Pandora] with a ‘buy’ last July with the stock at $18. That call clearly hasn’t worked. As a speculative ‘buy’ – with no profitability track record and no near-term profitable outlook – [Pandora] always carried very little margin for error. And now there’s error,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6 per cent to 12,837.78. The earthmover Caterpillar gained 2.2 per cent to $108.28, the third highest riser on the blue-chip index.The consumer goods maker Kraft was the biggest loser on the Dow, falling 1.2 per cent to $37.83 as the company was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” by Scott Mushkin, analyst at Jefferies.“2012, however, appears to be a year of investment and we expect limited upside for the next two to three quarters until the focus shifts to the post-separation outlook,” he said, adding that he still believed in the company’s longer-term prospects.Cyclical materials stocks recovered slightly, up 0.4 per cent, but have been the hardest hit sector on the S&P 500 this week, having dropped 3.4 per cent. The fertiliser maker CF Industries was up 4.1 per cent at $175.84. Eastman Chemical and Dow Chemical were up 2.1 per cent and 1.9 per cent to $51.17 and $33.12, respectively.Energy stocks were up 0.6 per cent led by a 7.3 per cent jump in shares of Valero Energy at $27. First Solar continued its losses, falling another 6.6 per cent to $25.80 as a report said the renewable energy company was cutting production at its operations in Germany and Malaysia.The Philadelphia Gold and Silver index was down 0.1 per cent, having fallen 8.3 per cent since Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, last week disappointed markets with a downbeat statement on the likelihood of a third round of quantitative easing.
28;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2012-02-02T10:35:09Z;Corn traders get in touch with their crude side;Farmers need to keep an eye on ethanol and oil markets;Ethanol refiners are the US corn farmer’s biggest customers, buying 40 per cent of the crop. So traders concerned about demand for corn should keep an eye on an emerging trend in ethanol exports.Those exports reached a record 121,000 barrels a day in November, according to Department of Energy data released this week. They have significantly boosted sales for the US ethanol industry and by extension, for the Corn Belt farmers who supply it.Now, anecdotal evidence shows exports are losing altitude.Decelerating shipments could shave demand for corn. Archer Daniels Midland, one of the US’s top two ethanol refiners, says exports declined into December.“Exports are starting to pick up, but they are still reduced,” Juan Luciano, ADM chief operating officer, told analysts on Tuesday. He expects net exports to total about 500m gallons this year – or about 32,000 b/d.Valero, the oil and ethanol refiner, forecast US ethanol exports of between 100,000 b/d-120,000 b/d this year. But the market is going through a “soft period right now,” Gene Edwards, chief development officer, told analysts.Ethanol exports surged last year as US petrol demand faltered and high sugar prices made Brazilian ethanol less competitive. Current US rules prevent fuel companies from blending more than 10 per cent ethanol into petrol, in most cases, which caps domestic use of the fuel additive in spite of mandates requiring more and more of it.Exports are the obvious outlet, but they haven’t been enough to evacuate excess supplies. “So we’ve been building inventories,” Mr Edwards said.This should concern farmers and merchants who have stored last year’s corn in anticipation of higher prices. As profit margins contract for ethanol refiners, weaker hands will be forced to reduce operating rates and, eventually, their corn purchases. Ethanol now tops animal feed as the leading use of the US corn crop, though some ethanol byproducts are fed to animals too.The strengthening bond between energy and corn markets was underscored by Soren Schroder, head of agribusiness Bunge’s North American unit, at a meeting of the Commodity Markets Council this week.“The two are forever linked. Even if you didn’t have mandates, there’s an economic value of corn that is tied to the price of gasoline,” he said.He said that based on their caloric values alone, corn would be between $5-$5.50 a bushel when crude oil is $100 a barrel. WTI crude, the US benchmark, closed at $97.61 a barrel yesterday, while corn was $6.42 a bushel.“You’d better know your stuff in ethanol if you want to trade and manage risk in global feed,” Mr Schroder said.The Financial Times is hosting its first Global Commodities Summit on April 24-25 in Lausanne, Switzerland.

29;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2012-01-20T13:37:12Z;Prospects bleak as Petroplus battles to survive;;As Europe’s largest independent refiner by capacity fights to stave off bankruptcy, customers of its Coryton refinery in Essex – a key source of petrol for London and south-east England – are already being warned of potential disruption to supplies.Switzerland-based Petroplus, Coryton’s owner, has been battling to stay in business since lenders froze a $1bn credit line late last year and it was forced to shut down refineries in France, Belgium and Switzerland. It now says it will sell the French plant – though in the current climate, with several other refineries up for sale in Europe, it will struggle to find a buyer.Earlier this month, the banks granted it a temporary reprieve, providing enough funds to keep two of its biggest plants going – Coryton and Ingolstadt in Germany – albeit at reduced capacity.BP, which used to own Coryton and is one of its biggest customers, has also offered a lifeline. It is considering a plan to supply crude to the refinery for free and take payment in refined products.But Petroplus’s future still looks bleak. Standard & Poor’s downgraded its debt this week, saying the likelihood of a near-term payment default has increased. It said there was a risk of bankruptcy if it failed to source alternative funding soon.Richard Howitt, East of England MEP, says he has been told by Coryton’s management that it only has enough credit to keep going until the end of the month. “There’s a real and genuine concern that Coryton could be forced to close,” he says. “If that happens, petrol in BP garage forecourts throughout London and the south east could dry up.”He is one of a group of MEPs who have urged the European Commission this week to protect Petropolus’s refineries from closure.Petroplus is the biggest casualty so far of the chill wind blowing through European refining. Last year was one of the worst on record for the industry. “It’s been a perfect storm, with weak demand, surplus capacity, especially in gasoline, and a high crude price,” says Ioanna Exarchou, an oil analyst at Citi.The situation is worrying Petroplus’s customers, including in the UK. Gist, a haulage company in Basingstoke, says Petroplus has notified it of potential supply disruptions. Gist says it has made arrangements with another fuel supplier.Other companies, such as DHL and Valero, have also drawn up contingency plans in case Coryton shuts down. “Obviously, you have to consider all scenarios,” says Valero’s Ruth Kent.The government, too, is keeping a close eye on Petroplus’s travails. With less than 200 days to go until the London Olympics, it cannot afford any hiccoughs with petrol supplies in the capital and deliveries of jet fuel to Heathrow. “You can’t run an Olympics without fuel, and the government knows that,” says one executive at a European oil company.The Department of Energy and Climate Change says it is monitoring the situation closely and is in “close touch with Petroplus and its main customers in the UK”.Petroplus is in a business that has long been under pressure. An analysis by the consultancy Wood Mackenzie in 2010 showed 29 of the 96 refineries in the EU did not generate a positive net cash margin – calculated as the value of their refined products, less cash operating expenses and the cost of the crude oil feedstock.Since then, things have become worse. Europe’s economic downturn has weakened demand for transport fuels, while competition has grown from the new generation of super-refineries in Asia.Backed by private equity, Petroplus grew fast in the 2000s when the outlook for refining was better, buying Coryton from BP for $1.4bn in 2007 as part of a debt-financed expansion drive.But it was snared by high finance costs. It reported a net loss of $413m in the first nine months of last year, and was forced to seek a waiver from creditors after the losses forced it to break debt covenants.Then in December, its banks pulled the plug on the uncommitted $1.05bn portion of its $2.01bn revolving credit facility, which is critical to its ability to buy crude oil.Other operators have fared better. Last year Ineos, a highly-leveraged chemicals producer, created a joint venture with PetroChina to refine and trade oil at two of its refineries. The deal was seen as a crucial way of securing the plants’ future.Analysts stress that Petroplus’s problems should not lead to fuel shortages in the UK. A mild winter means demand for heating oil is low: and any shortfall from domestic refineries can be made up with imports. That could change, however, in the event of a cold snap – or if Petroplus is forced to the wall and Coryton closes down completely.Petroplus going into administration “could have a significant impact on the UK fuels market,” says Brian Madderson, chairman of RMI Petrol. “It would be surprising if other domestic refiners could move quickly to bridge the gap without any increase in logistic costs and, therefore, retail prices,” he adds.

Seagate Technology said it had dispatched 47m hard disk drives in the three months to January in a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected. Seagate climbed 11.6 per cent to $18.30, while rival manufacturer Western Digital rose 8.2 per cent to $33.49.Semiconductor manufacturers LSI Corp, up 12.9 per cent to $6.72, and Micron Technology, up 14.5 per cent to $7.21, rallied in anticipation of stronger demand for computer memory chips.Bank of America climbed 11.2 per cent to $6.18, topping $6 for the first time since November, on the back of its strongest one day gain since October on Thursday. Analysts struggled to explain the stellar performance, which came as Citigroup analysts slashed earnings estimates for BofA, citing costs to settle mortgage-related lawsuits. Some suggested arbitrageurs might be buying BofA shares after the cost of protecting against a default by the bank fell in December without a corresponding rally in the stock price.Talk of a possible government plan to boost the housing market sent shares in homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.5 per cent to $7.10.It might also have helped large mortgage lenders outperform – SunTrust was up 11.6 per cent to $19.75 and Hudson City Bank, a New Jersey-based mortgage lender, rose 9.3 per cent to $6.83. But investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, lagged behind the pack.Goldman Sachs was up just 3.3 per cent to $93.42 while Jefferies climbed only 0.7 per cent to $13.85. Douglas Sipkin, of Ticonderoga Securities, slashed his quarterly earnings forecast for Goldman to 97 cents a share from $4.12 and tipped Morgan Stanley for a 59 cents a share loss, citing the weak trading environment.But Mr Sipkin said US investment banks could benefit from “widening bid- ask spreads, driven by the major retrenchment of European competitors”.CME Group, the largest US exchange by market capitalisation, fell 4 per cent to $234.00 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 4.6 per cent to $115.01 as JPMorgan analysts downgraded both exchanges to neutral, arguing that the companies’ estimates appeared optimistic and might have to be revised down.MasterCard fell 8 per cent to $342.92 as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its “buy” recommendation on the stock as well as Visa.Chesapeake Energy climbed 7.6 per cent to $23.98 after concluding a $2.3bn joint venture with French oil giant Total and EnerVest for shale gas and oil exploration in Ohio.Investor reaction was initially muted but the stock rallied late in the week, when the company said it had used JV revenues to reduce debt by $1.4bn to $10.3bn in the fourth quarter.Devon Energy was up 4.4 per cent to $64.75 after concluding its own $2.5bn shale joint venture with China’s Sinopec. But refiners sold off sharply after Tesoro said it could post a fourth-quarter loss of up to 80 cents a share because of collapsing margins. Tesoro fell 1.8 per cent to $22.95 followed by rivals Marathon Petroleum, off 4.9 per cent to $31.66, and Valero Energy, down 3.2 per cent to $20.37.Tesoro cited the narrowing of the Brent-WTI spread from $26 a barrel to $8 a barrel over the quarter, which cut margins at its mid-continent refineries, which account for 17 per cent of capacity and have benefited from access to cheaper WTI.Holiday sales reporting from US retailers drove stocks in different directions were mixed. Gap fell 3 per cent to $18 after December sales came in 4 per cent lower than the previous year. Ross Stores, the discount clothing chain, rose 6.8 per cent to $50.74 on a 9 per cent increase in same-store sales that easily beat the consensus analyst forecast of 4.2 per cent.Barnes & Noble slumped 19.9 per cent to $11.61 after the company said it was considering a sale of its Nook e-reader business.Netflix climbed 22.3 per cent to $84.70 after the company said subscribers streamed 2bn hours of video on its website in the fourth quarter, although it did not provide data from previous quarters for comparison.Alcoa climbed 6 per cent to $9.17 over the week, before it kicks off fourth quarter reporting season on Monday.But the stock slipped 2 per cent on Friday after the aluminium producer said it was cutting global capacity by 12 per cent and idling smelters in response to falling aluminium prices. Several analysts are predicting a quarterly loss for the company on Monday.

Goldman Sachs slipped 0.2 per cent to $94.58.The S&P 500 remained above its 200-day moving average for a third day, a sign of bullish sentiment, while Goldman Sachs reported that one-month realised correlation between the S&P 500 and its sectors, excluding financials, has fallen to its lowest level since August. That is an indication that macro concerns, which tend to shift all stocks in the same direction and increase realised correlation, weighed less on US investors in December.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off a fraction at 12,415.70.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.8 per cent to 2,669.86, as stocks along the hard disk drive supply chain rallied after Seagate Technology said fourth quarter shipments had been strong, a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected.Seagate climbed 6.4 per cent to $17.90 as it raised guidance, while rival hard disk drive manufacturer Western Digital climbed 4.7 per cent to $32.76.LSI Corp, which makes semiconductors used in hard drives, rose 7.7 per cent to $6.70 as Betsy Van Hees, analyst at Wedbush securities, recommended clients buy the stock on the Seagate results.Holiday sales reporting from US retailers drove stocks in different directions.

Shares had slumped more than 8 per cent on Tuesday, as investors feared the worst after Sears Holdings, whose outlets stock Whirlpool products, announced it would close up to 120 stores due to poor sales of consumer electronic goods.Sears Holdings shares also fell another 0.2 per cent to $33.33 after their 25 per cent fall on Tuesday, as analysts responded to the announced store closures.“While the company announced a series of measures to sustain cash flow, we do not see how they dig out of these problems,” said Gary Balter, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse.Mr Balter highlighted the company’s resort to bank borrowing lines at a time when retailers see high cash flow from holiday spending, and told clients, “one wonders if vendors begin to worry about their own exposure.”Data from Bloomberg on Wednesday suggested initial public offerings on US exchanges by internet businesses next year may raise $11bn, with Facebook expected to deliver the largest-ever internet IPO.But separate data from Birinyi Associates showed that the 19 internet and social media companies which debuted on US exchanges this year have generally delivered poor returns to investors.While the $6.2bn raised by internet and social media IPOs in 2011 was the third-highest ever, only trailing the $15.9bn raised in 1999 and $9.6bn in 2000, the majority of those companies are currently trading below their debut price.At the close last Friday, this year’s internet IPOs were on average 17.5 per cent below their IPO price compared to a 0.4 per cent decline for all other IPOs.Once first trading day jumps are factored out, new internet stocks have fared even worse. Investors who bought internet stocks at the open on their first day of trading had seen share prices fall an average of 37.5 per cent by the close last Friday, against an average loss on all other IPOs of 14.6 per cent, according to Birinyi.Of those 19 internet IPO stocks, 84 per cent were trading below their debut price at the close last Friday compared to 69 per cent for all the other IPOs this year.The trend continued yesterday with recent IPO stocks continuing to show softness.Social game developer Zynga was down 2.6 per cent to $9.50 yesterday, 50 cents beneath its launch price two weeks after its debut. LinkedIn was off 1.8 per cent to $61.73. The market capitalisation of the professional networking website has fallen by more than one-third since the start of August, although it remains well above its $45 debut price. Groupon fell 1.9 per cent to $22.62.“[Internet IPOs] have created trading opportunities in the short term, but if you are not allocated shares at the IPO price, buying in the open market on the first day of trading with the intent of holding the stock has not been a profitable strategy,” said Kevin Pleines, an analyst at Birinyi.
33;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

The Nasdaq Composite index trailed, up just 0.8 per cent to 2,646.85.Sectoral moves added to the sense of confusion. The financial sector of the S&P 500 rose 1.7 per cent, handily outperforming its peers, with those stocks most sensitive to eurozone contagion fears performing best.Morgan Stanley climbed 5.5 per cent to $16.38 for one of the best performances in the S&P 500 and Goldman Sachs was up 4.3 per cent to $101.45.Other cyclical stocks have tended to follow where financials led in recent months but materials and energy stocks were flat.Refiners were hard hit as RBC Capital Markets analysts said the return of light oil from Libya meant complex refiners would no longer be able to charge a premium for processing lower cost oils.Valero fell 6.3 per cent to $21.15. Tesoro suffered most after Edward Westlake, oil analyst at Credit Suisse, told clients: “A lack of dividend support [at Tesoro] leaves the shares more vulnerable to short-term movements in margins and compressing free cash flow in 2012.” Its shares fell 11.1 per cent to $21.79.Oilfield services companies also slipped as the Baker Hughes global oil and gas rig count fell for the first time since April when Nato action in Libya disrupted production.Halliburton fell 6.8 per cent to $34.08, not helped by allegations from BP that the company had intentionally destroyed evidence relating to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year. Noble Corp fell 4.6 per cent to $33.04 and Baker Hughes was off 6 per cent to $50.39.Waqar Syed, Goldman Sachs oil analyst, offered some hope for the sector as he resumed coverage with a positive outlook, predicting fracking of new oil wells in shale fields will increase 18 per cent in 2012.Shares in DuPont fell 4.2 per cent over the week to $45.04 with most of the damage done on Friday when the chemicals group cut 2011 earnings guidance by 10 cents a share to between $3.87 and $3.95.DuPont blamed weak demand as customers run down inventories rather than purchase new products, which knocked rival Dow Chemicals, whose shares fell 2.3 per cent to $27.10.Good news for wireless network provider Clearwire was bad news for investors in its largest customer and principal owner, the mobile network Sprint Nextel.Clearwire said it would raise $350m by issuing new shares at $2 apiece, easing bankruptcy fears. Shares held steady at $2.15. But Sprint shares fell 5 per cent to $2.47, as investors balked at the $300m investment the company must make to maintain its controlling stake in Clearwire.Analysts said Clearwire is even more dependent on Sprint for capital in light of Verizon’s deal to sell products jointly with cable companies Time Warner, Comcast and Bright House.Positive headlines did nothing to stop another bad week for US solar stocks.News that MidAmerican Energy, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, had purchased the Topaz solar farm in California from First Solar briefly lifted shares in the solar developer. But analysts poured cold water on the investment.“Let’s be clear, this is not Warren Buffett taking a bet on solar technology,” said Michael Horwitz, solar analyst at Robert W Baird. “This is Warren Buffett investing in a power plant that is guaranteed to yield large cash flows for at least 20 to 25 years,” he added. “The power plant just happens to be solar-powered.”First Solar ended the week down 4.4 per cent to $45.67. Solar panel manufacturer MEMC Electronic Materials climbed 3.3 per cent to $4.42, but analysts were unimpressed after management announced a restructuring that will see it reduce output.

The normally volatile Nasdaq was given ballast by Apple, its most heavily weighted stock, which climbed 0.4 per cent to $390.66.The iPhone manufacturer was boosted by news that AT&T is set to sell a record number of smartphones this year, with sales driven by strong demand for Apple’s iPhone 4s.Analysts were divided on whether this was good news for AT&T, with Citigroup analysts focusing on the positive impact on revenue but Baird analysts arguing the high subsidies AT&T has to pay to Apple for iPhone users will hurt margins. AT&T shares fell 1.8 per cent to $28.86.The financial sector of the S&P 500 tumbled 3.7 per cent with big banks buffeted by the European news.Citigroup fell 7 per cent to $27.75, Morgan Stanley 8.4 per cent to $15.88 and Goldman Sachs 5 per cent to $99.92.A JPMorgan note offered some respite for US lenders with data from Dealogic showing high-yield debt underwriting had increased sequentially for two months running.SunTrust was the main beneficiary with underwriting fees in October and November exceeding the whole of the third quarter, while US Bancorp saw strong growth in commercial and industrial loans, as JPMorgan’s analysis of weekly bank filings suggested solid fourth-quarter growth in credit.Investors were unconvinced as SunTrust shares fell 5 per cent to $17.30, and US Bancorp fell 2.9 per cent to $25.65.Clearwire dealt existing investors a blow after pricing an upcoming share offer at $2.00, a discount of $0.28 to Wednesday’s closing price.Shares in the wireless network, which is fighting bankruptcy, fell 4 per cent to $2.19, after hitting $2.04 in the morning session.Clearwire also said it would raise $350m through the share offering, $50m more than previously planned.That meant its largest customer, mobile phone network Sprint Nextel, will have to invest more capital in the company than previously thought to maintain its controlling interest.Sprint shares fell 4.7 per cent to $2.44.Analysts said Clearwire is even more dependent on Sprint for capital in light of Verizon’s deal to jointly sell products with cable companies Time Warner, Comcast and Bright House.“There is no way cable companies will renew contracts with Clearwire now because they will be reselling Verizon Wireless,” said Christopher King of Stifel Nicolaus. “That ends any hope that cable operators will commit capital to keep Clearwire afloat.”Solar panel manufacturer MEMC Electronic Materials fell 0.2 per cent to $4.20, but had earlier tumbled to a new year low of $3.85 after announcing it will combine its project development and solar materials businesses.The company will take a $700m charge and reduce output as part of the restructuring. MEMC’s share price has collapsed this year as Chinese companies have created a glut of solar panel supply, driving down the price of polysilicon.“It really pains me to support a company all the way down 60 per cent year-to- date and then give up on it, calling for an even lower price, but that is what I had to do today,” said Theodore O’Neil, solar analyst at Wunderlich Securities, who advised clients to sell the stock.“I think MEMC is doing precisely what it needs to do to try and turn profitable, but it seems to me that the Chinese have won and if we stay the course, we will just chase a rabbit down the hole,” he added.Halliburton defied the market, falling just 0.8 per cent to $33.13 after Goldman Sachs resumed coverage of the oilfield services sector with a “positive” outlook.But Transocean fell 3.2 per cent to $43.95, as Waqar Syed, Goldman’s analyst warned, “structurally higher downtime and costs” would hurt those firms which have not updated equipment since the Macondo oil spill last year.Valero was knocked by a downgrade from RBC analysts who said the return of light oil from Libya means complex refiners will no longer be able to charge a premium for processing lower cost oils.Shares fell 5.4 per cent to $20.88Ford Motor fell 3 per cent to $10.75, despite reinstating a dividend, ending five years without a pay-out.Shares in IBM fell 1.3 per cent to $191.58 after the computer services company purchased market research firm DemandTec for $440m.Costco shares fell 2 per cent to $85.76 despite a double-digit increase in revenue in the 12 weeks ended November 20 compared with the same period last year.The European news overshadowed improving US data as new jobless claims fell to 381,000 from 404,000 a week ago to touch their lowest level since February.
36;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Pipeline switch helps CME’s WTI woes;Oil benchmark jumps above $100 on Seaway reversal;You could practically hear cheers coming from the Nymex building in Manhattan on Wednesday.Two companies had just announced plans to reverse a pipeline in a move that will relieve stocks around Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures.West Texas Intermediate, as the futures contract is known, zoomed back above $100 a barrel and further left behind what had become a bizarre discount to other oils on the global market.The reversal of the Seaway pipeline, if it comes to pass, will have important consequences from Canada’s tar sands to Gulf of Mexico refineries to Washington, where regulators are reviewing the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that would partly parallel it.Later on Wednesday, Keystone builder TransCanada told analysts it may move ahead with a section of that line connecting Cushing with the Gulf.But among the parties with the most at stake is Nymex, or more properly its parent, Chicago’s CME Group.WTI is CME’s flagship energy futures contract and the company defends it as the standard by which to measure the global price of oil.That status has become dubious in the past year as WTI lagged behind other crude streams, including Brent traded on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange and Light Louisiana Sweet along the Gulf. Last month the Brent-WTI spread reached a jaw-dropping $28.Earlier this year refiner Valero bashed WTI as irrelevant, while Delta Air Lines largely dropped it as a way to hedge fuel costs. Last month the Dow Jones-UBS commodity index, which happens to be marketed by a CME Group subsidiary, said it will add Brent to its basket of futures for the first time.A key reason why WTI has lagged behind is a lack of pipelines that have prevented arbitrageurs from buying up high stocks of cheap crude around Cushing and sending them to the Gulf, closing the price gap in the process. So CME took the uncommon step of publicly congratulating the pipeline companies Enbridge and Enterprise Products Partners for their plans to reverse Seaway to run from instead of to Cushing.“We believe this new project will enhance the significance of our Nymex Light Sweet Crude Oil (WTI) benchmark,” the CME said.The pipeline reversal plan suggests that problems such as WTI’s severe discount are self-correcting. A $28-a-barrel discount is just too tempting for a trader, or a pipeline company, to pass up. As one oil derivatives dealer emailed me: “Finally the levee breaks.”Seaway’s own history illustrates the interplay of market forces and infrastructure. Built to move crude to Cushing, it converted to natural gas service in 1984 before being enlisted to carry crude again in 1996, according to a study CME commissioned last year. This is just the latest fix.

But the benchmark US index eventually closed down 1.7 per cent to 1,236.92.“Its very frustrating. We’re trying to shift back to a US-centric analysis, but this Fitch report has brought the eurozone back into focus,” said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Federated Investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.6 per cent to 11,905.97, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.7 per cent to 2,639.61.Elsewhere on Wednesday, companies along the hard drive supply chain were given a boost, after Western Digital Corp, the single largest manufacturer, said it had reached a deal with Japanese electronics manufacturer TDK to buy “heads” – a crucial component in hard drives, which Western Digital has had trouble manufacturing since it closed factories due to flooding in Thailand last month.Western Digital shares closed up 7.1 per cent to $26.82, also boosted by a report that the European Commission will clear the company’s bid to acquire Hitachi’s hard drive unit.“This is a big deal as heads were the biggest challenge to restarting production,” said Jayson Noland, a tech analyst at Robert W Baird, “but it’s impossible to quantify the impact until we get details on the deal from Western,” he cautioned.Quarterly results from Dell were more sobering for the sector, with revenue from sales of personal computers, still the single largest source of demand for hard drives, falling 4 per cent year-on-year.Dell shares were off 3.2 per cent to $15.13, although some analysts were encouraged by signs of strong growth in storage and enterprise services.“The company seems to be executing its plan to transform into higher value and higher margin areas,” said Jeffrey Fidacaro at Susquehanna.Semiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology surged 23.4 per cent to $6.74, after a jury dismissed claims that the company had colluded with Korean firm Hynix Semiconductor to fix the prices of computer memory chips.The case had been brought by Rambus, a tech innovation company, which had been seeking more than $4bn in damages.The market capitalisation of Rambus, which relies on aggressive litigation to protect its patent rights, collapsed, falling more than 60 per cent to $7.11.“Following two key legal losses, which we believed were the cornerstone to our investment thesis in Rambus, we are now recommending investors exit positions,” Jeff Schreiner, an analyst at Capstone investments, told clients as he dropped coverage of Rambus after the decision.Midwestern oil refiners took a hit, as the discount of WTI crude oil to Brent crude shrunk to its lowest in more than six months.Western Refining Inc fell 13.5 per cent to $13.42, and CVR Energy tumbled 16.3 per cent to $18.38. Both companies are almost exclusively dependent on WTI, which has sold at a steep discount to Brent for most of the year, as transport constraints created a supply glut at the WTI terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma.News that Canadian firm Enbridge will allow WTI crude to flow to the Gulf Coast from Cushing through a newly acquired pipeline next year erased much of that discount.Even refiners with a small exposure to WTI were significantly affected.Shares in Tesoro fell 6.9 per cent to $25.00. WTI only accounts for 20 per cent of Tesoro’s crude, but Citigroup had expected that output to produce 60 per cent of 2012 earnings because of the lower input costs.The share prices of refiners with as little as 15 per cent exposure to WTI crude, such as Valero Energy, have seen strong correlation with the Brent-WTI spread this year, at least until August, when they were caught up in the wider market sell off. Valero fell 9.3 per cent to $22.56 on Wednesday.Abercrombie & Fitch plunged 13.6 per cent to $48.10, after third-quarter results badly disappointed analysts. Earnings per share of 56 cents were a full 15 cents lower than the average analyst expectation in a Bloomberg poll.Autodesk rose 4.5 per cent to $35.58, after the design software maker reported third-quarter profit of 44 cents a share, exceeding analyst estimates, despite worries about that business would cut back on spending given global growth concerns.

But Peter Nesvold at Jefferies said investors were overreacting to the overspend on product launches in the fourth quarter of 2010.“Product launches slated for this year are much lower, and I don’t think margins are going to be squeezed by that as much as investors think,” Mr Nesvold said.The S&P 500 ended the day up 1.1 per cent to 1,242, after a late spurt fuelled by reports that French President Nicolas Sarkozy will talk to his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao today about contributions to the eurozone crisis fund.“A favourable outcome to the Europeans negotiations seems to be increasingly priced into the markets,” said Channing Smith at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors. “But its all talk for now, and without concrete plans we’re unlikely to buy into the rally.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.4 per cent to 11,869.04, helped by a good day for Boeing. The Seattle-based aircraft and defence group jumped 4.5 per cent to $66.56 after it said it would take a profit from the first 1,100 sales of its new 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Fears that the expensive Dreamliner would take some time to reach profitability had weighed on the stock.The Nasdaq Composite index lagged behind the other two principal indices, up only 0.5 per cent to 2,650.67, as shares in online retailer Amazon, one of the biggest components of the index, plunged 12.7 per cent.Amazon closed at $198.40 after the company said it might report a loss in the fourth quarter due to expenditure on product development. Amazon has been profitable since 2002, but R&D expenditure has more than doubled from $300m at the start of 2009, forcing the company’s operating margin down from above 4 per cent to under 1 per cent over the same period.A relief rally in shares of solar panel manufacturer First Solar sent the stock up 6.6 per cent. The company rushed out quarterly results to calm investors following the unexplained departure of chief executive Rob Gillette on Tuesday afternoon. Results were poor, with earnings per share of 70 cents for the quarter down almost 50 per cent from the previous quarter and almost two-thirds from the same quarter of 2010But shares rallied as much as 15 per cent before closing at $46.11. That leaves the stock off 7.9 per cent for the week, after the company lost 25 per cent of its market capitalisation on Tuesday.“There were all kinds of rumours around when the chief left suddenly,” said Jeff Osborne at Stifel Nicolaus, “this gives some visibility to investors.”Lockheed Martin, the defence conglomerate, fell 3.2 per cent to $76.35, despite increasing its full-year earnings guidance as it announced healthy quarterly results.The company said 2011 profit would be between $7.40 and $7.60 a share. That was an increase of 5 cents at both ends of the range compared with the forecast made in July.But Lockheed said profit in 2012 would be flat at best, with pension costs posing downside risk.Oil refiner Valero was up 15.2 per cent to $25.11 on reports larger rivals may bid for the company. That put the stock marginally in the black for the week, after heavy selling on Monday and Tuesday, in response to a narrowing of the spread between WTI crude oil and Brent. The narrower spread erodes the margins Valero earns by sourcing some of its oil from cheaper sources.For-profit education provider Devry fell 16.8 per cent to $38.36 after the company saw profits fall 22 per cent compared with the same quarter in 2010. For-profit colleges have seen enrolments plunge.Sprint Nextel fell 7 per cent to $2.51 after the company said it would have to raise between $5bn and $7bn towards capital expenditure on projects, including a wireless network upgrade.The third-largest US mobile phone network beat analyst estimates on quarterly earnings, with net losses of $301m, or 10 cents per share, on revenue of $8.3bn.Computer network and data storage provider F5 Networks jumped 14.1 per cent to $101.26, after beating analyst forecasts with strong earnings.Fears of a slowdown in government and corporate IT spending have weighed on tech stocks, but Paul Silverstein at Credit Suisse, said F5 was “leveraged to the strongest secular tech growth drivers including data centre consolidation …cloud computing adoption and storage growth.”Express Scripts, a company which fills medical prescriptions, rose 13.5 per cent to $43.66 after earnings rose almost 10 per cent compared to the same quarter last year, boosted by a small increase in margins.Walgreen fell 1.7 per cent to $33.25 after Express’ chief executive George Paz told analysts on an earnings call that it is “less and less likely” that the company would reach an agreement for Express clients to keep filling prescriptions at Walgreen pharmacies.

Up to a third of the crude refined by both companies is WTI.The S&P 500 fell 2 per cent to 1,229.11, its second worst daily performance this month, after worse than expected house price data, and cautious trading ahead of Wednesday’s eurozone summit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.7 per cent to 11,706.7, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 2.3 per cent at 2,638.42, back into negative territory for the year.Netflix shares plunged more than a third after the movie-streaming and DVD delivery service said domestic users fell by almost 1m during the third quarter – a larger fall than the company had predicted in mid-September.The stock fell 34.9 per cent to $77.37. The setback followed a tumultuous month, after the company increased the price of its joint DVD and streaming service by 60 per cent before announcing and then retracting a decision to divide the two units.Netflix’s market capitalisation has fallen by two-thirds since September 15, when the company first told investors it would lose subscribers.James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities, one of the few analysts who had maintained a “buy” on the stock through its stormy month, downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a “sell”.Goldman Sachs also dropped its “buy” rating on Netflix.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar plunged 25.3 per cent to $43.27 in just a few minutes of extremely heavy trading mid-afternoon, after the company announced the departure of its chief executive without explanation.Quest Diagnostic was the standout performer in the S&P 500, jumping 10.9 per cent to $56.50, after the clinical testing company eked out positive earnings on stronger margins, despite falling sales. That helped Quest’s rival Laboratory Corporation of America rise 1.2 per cent to $84.07.Analogue semiconductor manufacturer Texas Instruments was down 2.3 per cent at $30.95, after the company’s fourth-quarter revenue estimate disappointed the market.An earnings miss and bleak fourth-quarter guidance from industrial conglomerate 3M hit cyclical industrial and energy stocks. 3M was down 6.3 per cent to $77.04, Cummins was off 5.1 per cent to $93.81, after the engine manufacturer also cut full-year earnings guidance, citing weak demand from China and India, and a strong dollar.Despite beating revenue and earnings expectations Illinois Toolworks fell 5.4 per cent to $45.65, after the company forecast weaker demand from Europe in the fourth quarter.AK Steel Holding shed 13.6 per cent to $7.47 after the company declared a loss of $3.5m or 3 cents a share.Coal miner Peabody Energy ended a volatile day down 3.1 per cent at $39.66. The stock fell as much as 8 per cent at the start of trading after ArcelorMittal pulled out of a joint bid for Australian miner Macarthur Coal, leaving Peabody needing $5bn to fund the acquisition on its own.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Management used an earnings conference call to reassure analysts the company will be able to raise the finance through debt markets, rather than by issuing new equity, leading the stock to rally back towards $40.94 where it closed on Monday, before falling again.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Analysts had spent Tuesday morning debating the breadth of the current rally. Bespoke Investment Group found 90 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 were trading above their 50-day average at the close on Monday. That is the highest level since October 2010 and suggests the rally has extended beyond large-cap stocks, multinationals and high dividend payers, which led the two previous rallies since the August slump.But fund flows into exchange traded funds appeared to suggest the opposite, with $900m withdrawn from funds targeting small-cap companies.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, also played down the strength of quarterly results. Aggregate earnings reported by S&P 500 companies have exceeded consensus expectations by 5.4 per cent. But excluding financials, the margin has been 1.9 per cent, which is below the 5.3 per cent margin in the second quarter and the 6.1 per cent margin in the first quarter.
40;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2011-08-17T18:05:30Z;Brent climbs as investors digest stocks data;;Crude oil in London rose above $110 a barrel for the first time in two weeks, even as data showed a big injection of government stocks into the market.ICE October Brent crude rose $2.02 to $111.15 a barrel, after touching $111.74 in early trade. Nymex September West Texas Intermediate gained $1.12 to $87.77.Brent had plunged below $100 last week in the aftermath of the US credit rating downgrade, worries over eurozone debt and signs of slowing economic growth. But with global demand still rising, prices have gained in five of the past six sessions.“Oil came off with the decline in equity markets in a risk-off phase,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at BNP Paribas. “After the correction, what we’re looking at is the oil market’s return to its own dynamics.”Oil’s rebound has come while a 60m-barrel emergency stock release co-ordinated by the International Energy Agency is in full swing. The US is supplying about half the amount from its strategic petroleum reserve.On Wednesday the US government reported stocks from the reserve had fallen by 5.9m barrels in the week ended August 12, while commercial stocks rose 4.2m barrels to 354m barrels. In all 20.4m barrels of light, sweet crude has been delivered since late July to buyers ranging from Valero, the largest independent US refiner, to Barclays, the UK bank. Deliveries have boosted supplies along the US Gulf of Mexico, where the strategic stocks are safeguarded.Crude prices have eased since the IEA announced the release on June 23, but the bigger impact has been on prices in different places. Light Louisiana Sweet, a Gulf of Mexico benchmark, has weakened relative to Brent, encouraging traders to send cargoes to European refiners struggling with the loss of Libyan output.US crude imports have declined by 6.1 per cent from a year ago to 9.3m barrels a day in the past four weeks, the energy department said.“Although today’s domestic production in the US is higher than recent years, the flow of crude out of the SPR has pushed barrels away from the US and into other markets where needed,” Lawrence Eagles, JPMorgan head of oil research, said in a note.Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, also increased output by more than 900,000 b/d in June to 9.8m b/d, official Joint Organisations Data Initiative records showed on Wednesday. The boost fulfils the kingdom’s commitment to increase supplies in the wake of a fractious Opec meeting on June 8.However analysts say Saudi Arabia’s crude will not replace high-quality supplies lost from Libya, where rebels on Wednesday had attacked an oil refinery west of Tripoli.

The Russell 2000 index of small and mid-cap groups dropped 7.9 per cent.The main indices had been bolstered briefly on Friday by indications that the European Central Bank would buy Italian and Spanish debt.That continued to shield stocks from a more precipitous fall early in the session before a late sell-off after Barack Obama, US president, made an afternoon speech on the credit downgrade that traders felt lacked conviction.Bank of America  was the biggest faller on the S&P 500, plummeting 20.1 per cent to $6.75 after American International Group filed a lawsuit against the bank for loses incurred on mortgage-backed securities.Citigroup also dropped 15.8 per cent to $28.16, while Genworth Financial sank 16.8 per cent to $5.64.Energy stocks again also saw steep declines, dropping 3.3 per cent in the opening minutes of trading as oil and gas prices fell. Stocks directly tied to the economy were also targeted in the sell-off.Alpha Natural Resources, the coal producer, continued its downward slide after second-quarter losses last week, slumping a further 18.5 per cent to $26.35.Valero Energy, the pertroleum company, was also down 11.6 per cent to $18.31, while US Steel lost 13.1 per cent to $28.84.Sunoco, another petroleum company that last week admitted it had just finished an “abysmal” quarter, fell a further 11.6 per cent to $30.08.But a new record for gold saw shares of Newmont Mining, a producer of the precious metal, lose just 0.5 per cent to $54.13 a share. Newmont shares were among the few to post gains last week, adding 0.2 per cent.Large-cap shares were not targeted as hard, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 5.6 per cent to 10,809.85.It was heavily weighed by the steep drop in shares of Bank of America, but strategists at UBS and Morgan Stanley recommended shifts into large-cap growth shares as a defensive move.Tyson Foods, the only S&P 500 company reporting earnings, was down 3.7 per cent at $15.71 despite the meat and poultry seller topped earnings expectations for the quarter, earning 46 cents a share versus forecasts of 39 cents.Dean Foods, which unlike Tyson primarily uses agricultural commodities as inputs, saw its shares drop 7.3 per cent to $8.40, among the worst performers in the S&P 500.Despite the day’s losses, strategists were broadly arguing that the rating agency’s downgrade was not a strong direct catalyst for share prices, which globally enjoyed their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis amid slowing economic growth in big economies and worries about European sovereign debt.“Today’s tape is going to look worse than it should,” said Nicholas Bohnsack, sector strategist at Strategas, a research firm. “Did S&P really tell us something we didn’t know?“Corporates are the new sovereigns with so much cash on their balance sheets. That kind of goes out the window for a day or two here as we sort out where Treasuries will be priced but I don’t think this will have an impact on companies.”Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Baird, suggested that there could be a case for a turnround, given that investor sentiment as measured by the American Association of Individual Investors showed a drop in the percentage of retail investors surveyed calling themselves “bears” – marking a bottom for the widely followed indicator.“The equity markets are extremely oversold and investor fear is beginning to creep in,” he said.However, he warned: “Until the momentum is interrupted by two sessions where upside volume overwhelms downside volume by a ratio of at least 10 to one, investors should be defensive.”Elsewhere, Priceline.com, the discount travel website, among the best market performers of the past two years, fell back after big jumps last week as its earnings and travel bookings came in ahead of expectations. Its stock dropped 4.3 per cent to $505.00.Sprint Nextel, the mobile phone company, extended its recent slump, falling 15.9 per cent to $3.13, in spite of announcing that it would launch its new 4G model, priced at less than $100, later this month.
42;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2011-07-29T14:47:08Z;Chevron earnings jump on high oil prices;;Chevron has become the latest leading company to announce a jump in second-quarter earnings on the back of higher energy prices.The second-biggest oil company in the US reported net income of $7.7bn for the period, up 43 per cent from the same period the year before, beating estimates as strong oil prices and higher refining margins offset a fall in output.“Earnings gains versus last year’s quarter were primarily in our oil and gas exploration business, resulting from higher crude oil prices on world markets,” said John Watson, chairman and chief executive.Chevron’s shares fell 1.16 per cent to $103.81 a share in early morning trading in New York as part of a broader sell-off in the market. It declared a quarterly dividend of $0.78 a share.US rival ExxonMobil and European peers Royal Dutch Shell and BP also posted stronger earnings earlier this week, buoyed by Brent crude prices that have averaged $117 a barrel in the second quarter, up from $79 a barrel in the same period in 2010.Worldwide net oil-equivalent production for the quarter, however, was 2.69m barrels a day, down from 2.75m b/d in the same period last year. Production increases from project ramp-ups in Canada and the US, and new volumes from the Atlas Energy acquisition, were offset by a negative effect of about 40,000 b/d from higher prices on volumes related to cost recovery and variable royalty contract terms, as well as normal field declines, the company said.Despite the drop, Chevron reaffirmed its outlook for annual production growth of about 1 per cent for 2010-2014 and 4.5 per cent for 2014 to 2017.US refining and marketing operations were lifted by higher margins, earning $564m in the quarter compared with $433m a year earlier.The quarter was marked by a return to work in the Gulf of Mexico where activity was beginning to pick up again after last year’s BP spill. Chevron has three rigs active in the deepwater, including one drilling the Moccasin exploration well. The company is also drilling on the Gulf of Mexico shelf to test for an ultra-deep gas field.Also in the US, Chevron acquired additional unconventional gas acreage in the Marcellus Shale. In the UK, Chevron is selling its Pembroke oil refinery in south-west Wales, the site of an explosion in June, to Texan company Valero. The sale is expected to close in the third quarter.Like its peers, Chevron is spending heavily on capital and exploratory expenditure. The company spent $13.4bn in the first six months of this year, compared with $9.4bn in the same period the year before.Meanwhile, Total and ENI, the French and Italian oil majors, both reported lower second-quarter earnings compared with a year ago as a weaker dollar and production outages in Libya took their toll.Total said second-quarter net income, excluding the value of inventory and one-off items, fell 6 per cent from the same period last year to €2.8bn. Eni’s underlying net profit fell 14 per cent to €1.44bn as Libyan outages pushed its production down 15 per cent to 1.49m barrels of oil equivalent per day.
43;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2011-07-27T07:42:05Z;Kuwait oil production flirts with 37-year peak;Emirate joins Saudi Arabia in raising output;Saudia Arabia is getting all the attention as it unilaterally boosted its oil production after last month’s failed Opec meeting, but neighbouring Kuwait deserves consideration too.The emirate, which at the begining of the year was pumping 2.3m barrels a day, is ramping up its output significantly, according to industry executives. The estimates vary, but some put Kuwait’s oil production now at a 37-year peak of about 2.7m b/d.Anecdotal evidence confirms that the emirate is willing to ship more oil to its long-term customers. Valero, the largest independent refiner in the US and usually seen as setting the trends in the industry, said on Tuesday during its second-quarter results conference call with analysts that Kuwait was offering more oil.Joseph Gorder, Valero’s chief commercial officer and head of supply, said that the company was about to bring in more Kuwaiti barrels into the refining hub of the US Gulf.“The Kuwaitis have lifted their imposed reduction of contract volumes. We were operating for a period there where we had a 10 per cent reduction in our contract volume. They notified us that they were taking that off and that we were able to take more barrels,” he said.Mr Gorder added: “I do think we’re going to see a lot more medium-sour barrels [the kind of oil Kuwait produces] coming into the market.”The second-quarter results reporting period continues on Wednesday until the middle of next week and other big US refiners are likely to offer fresh clues about Middle East oil production.Kuwait ships most of its crude oil into Asia, where industry officials also said that the emirate had offered extra barrels for July and August, lifting contract limitations.The International Energy Agency’s last estimate of Kuwait production put it at 2.5m b/d in June. But the western countries’ oil watchdog warned that the emirate’s state-owned oil company Kuwait Petroleum Corporation was “bumping up near capacity of 2.54m b/d”.Yet, industry officials claim that KPC is now able to produce more than the IEA’s maximum capacity estimate, in part thanks to the easing of an export bottleneck at the Mina al-Ahmadi oil terminal, which has allowed for additional production from the super-giant Burgan oil field, the world’s second largest by output.Industry officials claim the emirate could boost output to more than the recent peak of 2.6m b/d in mid-2008 and bring it to the highest since 1973. Kuwait’s oil output hit an all-time high of 3.3m b/d in 1972.The additional supply would be welcome by the market. Yet, Saudi Arabia remains the king. Riyadh has lifted its production to 9.7m b/d, the highest level since early 2006 and many expect a further increase in July. Mr Gorder of Valero, echoing an industry consensus, said on Tuesday: “I understand that Saudis are going up to 10m b/d”.
44;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Shares in small refiners surge with crude spread;;A batch of obscure US petroleum refiners has become one of the hottest trades of the commodities market as hedge funds bid for their shares to profit from an anomaly in global crude oil prices.Shares of refiners such as CVR Energy, Delek, HollyFrontier and Western Refining have surged between 75 and 130 per cent year-to-date, well above the 10-15 per cent rise of better-known oil companies such as ExxonMobil and Valero, the largest independent US refiner.Hedge funds such as Third Point, run by Daniel S. Loeb, Appaloosa, Eton Park, 1798 Global Partners and D E Shaw have all built significant positions in some of the small companies, according to regulatory filings. The refiners operate in the US mid-continent region where the benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude now sells at an extreme discount to other crude streams.For years WTI traded at a premium to Europe’s Brent and other light US crudes. But a glut at its delivery point in Cushing, Oklahoma, after regional production surged has imposed a large markdown. This month WTI’s discount widened to a record $23 a barrel. No pipelines run from landlocked Cushing to the refinery corridor along the Gulf of Mexico, or to refineries in the east and west coast, so regional refineries able to tap the hub to make fuel have seen profit margins widen sharply.Western, which has two small refineries that supply less than 0.9 per cent of US fuel needs, said in a filing the imbalance was “a positive development for us as all of our oil purchases are based on pricing tied to WTI”. CVR, with a lone small refinery 100 miles from Cushing, enjoyed margins of more than $20 a barrel in the first quarter, from $6 a barrel a year before. The reporting season for the refiners, to start this week, is likely to show even better economics in the second quarter of the year.“They are benefiting because they have a raw material cost advantage,” said Andy Lipow, of consultants Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.Analysts believe the regional refiners could get even cheaper oil in early 2012, further attracting investors to bid up their shares.Evan Calio, at Morgan Stanley, said that the WTI-Brent discount could expand to $50 a barrel by next spring. “Less than five per cent of global refining capacity can process WTI-advantaged crude oils, capturing the differential and directly increasing gross margins,” he said.Ed Morse, at Citigroup, said the US mid-continent had become an island separated from the global oil market as a “wave of more, and more, and more oil output” had nowhere to go because of a “lack of ability to evacuate oil from the region, whether by pipeline, rail, truck or barge”.Morse, who in 2009 was among the first to predict the collapse in the WTI-Brent price relationship, said that WTI prices could drop so much relative to other benchmarks that some US oil producers shut down output. Refiners in the central US were last week operating at 96.6 per cent of capacity, suggesting a limited appetite for additional crude.
45;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2011-07-14T19:57:52Z;ConocoPhillips;Supermajor transforms itself into a big fish in a small pond;If at first you don’t succeed, try something else. ConocoPhillips had reformed its old ways, eschewing growth to focus on balance sheet repair and shareholder returns and delivering the highest cash yield (dividends plus buy-backs) of any big western energy company. Even so, it has had the worst total return of US supermajors, year to date.Except for the results, it was hard to fault Conoco’s strategy, but it has now ditched that for the shareholder-friendly move du jour – splitting itself into upstream and downstream businesses, just as smaller rivals Marathon and Murphy Oil did recently to loud stock market applause. Conoco is the first supermajor to attempt this but the initial reaction, a nearly 8 per cent rally, means it may not be the last.So it is converting itself from a small fish in a big pond – certainly the puniest company worthy of the moniker “supermajor” at just a quarter of the value of ExxonMobil and half of Chevron – to the opposite in its new categories. It will be the second largest independent US refiner after Valero and easily the largest pure play exploration and production outfit.Simply applying the average multiples of enterprise value to revenue of its leading peers in each category, 0.24 and 4.3 times, respectively, suggests a tantalising composite market value of around $200bn for Conoco, an 85 per cent premium to today’s price. That is too optimistic, but it highlights the discount accorded to Big Oil.Whether or not the sum of the parts really is greater than the whole, this is what the market believes and perception is reality. But shareholders in other supermajors should recognise that the “big” in Big Oil is still a virtue, even if integration is not. Even more than in the heyday of the Seven Sisters era, upstream projects are capital-intensive and risky.Those pushing for more supermajor splits should not expect a similar pay-off either, as Conoco was the most integrated of the integrateds, and too cheap to boot. Less is more, but not much more.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
46;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2011-07-12T19:02:09Z;US ethanol refiners use more corn than farmers;;US ethanol refiners are consuming more domestic corn than livestock and poultry farmers for the first time, underscoring how a government-supported biofuels industry has contributed to surging grain demand.The US Department of Agriculture estimated that in the year to August 31 ethanol producers will have consumed 5.05bn bushels of corn, or more than 40 per cent of last year’s harvest. Animal feed and residual demand accounted for 5bn bushels.The figures, from the world’s largest corn producer and exporter, come amid growing scrutiny of the biofuels sector and mounting concern over food inflation.Last month the G20 group of leading nations, in its first communiqué on agriculture, decided against calling for reduced biofuel use.In the US, key senators have reached a preliminary agreement to kill off tax and tariff support for the domestic ethanol industry though mandates requiring ethanol blending with petrol remain.“It’s a tipping point,” said Luke Chandler, Rabobank global head of agricultural research. Next year USDA expects ethanol groups will use another 100m bushels.The department cut its estimate of feed and residual demand for corn by 150m bushels, while raising its ethanol demand figure by 50m bushels as “margins have improved for producers”, said Jerry Norton, USDA grains analyst.Some corn used for ethanol will return to the food supply as animal feed and corn oil.Despite corn prices that are 90 per cent higher than a year ago, US ethanol production is expected to reach a record 13.7bn gallons this year, exceeding mandated levels by 1bn gallons, the Renewable Fuels Association said.Extra output has been exported abroad, including to Brazil, a leading sugar-based ethanol producer.The meat industry and some environmentalists say rising corn consumption by ethanol refiners including Archer Daniels Midland, Poet and Valero Energy has driven up food prices.Demand for corn, used to fatten cattle and make starches and sweeteners as well as ethanol, is also rising. USDA increased its global consumption forecast by 5.9m tonnes to 877.6m in the coming year because animals are eating more corn.China, once self-sufficient in corn, is now expected to import 2m tonnes after recent reported purchases from the US.High petrol prices have kept ethanol production attractive. Chicago ethanol futures were on Tuesday 30 cents cheaper per gallon than petrol futures traded in New York. Corn futures gained 2.8 per cent to top $7 per bushel, the highest level since June.
47;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2011-07-01T21:34:22Z;Record US oil sale eases global supply picture;;The US on Friday raised billions of dollars by selling the biggest ever amount of oil from its strategic petroleum reserve to 15 companies including investment banks, trading houses, oil majors, and refiners.The sale, which followed the decision by western countries to release emergency stocks, was “substantially oversubscribed”, the Department of Energy said, underscoring the tight market for light, sweet crude.The announcement on Friday that the US had received successful orders for more than 30m barrels to be sold from the reserve will mean the world’s largest oil consumer will have to import less oil from across the Atlantic, leaving more available for European and Asian refineries.The news put pressure on oil prices. Light Louisiana Sweet crude, the grade of oil that was the benchmark for the US sale, dropped more than $2 in after the news to a low of $106.88 a barrel, before recovering to $108.64. That was in line with the prices offered for the US reserves, which ranged from $104.98 to $109.76, averaging just over $107. ICE August Brent, the global benchmark, fell as much as $2.98 to $109.50. It was down 71 cents at $111.77 in late trade on Friday.The US offered the crude as part the International Energy Agency plan to release 60m barrels of oil after Opec, the oil producers’ cartel, failed to raise production and as fighting in Libya has removed its crude supply from global markets. The US said it had received more than 90 offers to buy government-owned crude stored in underground caverns along the Gulf of Mexico.Fifteen companies won bids for 30.64m barrels for a total of $3.3bn, based on current market prices. The final prices paid will depend on the market price at the time of delivery.Valero, the largest US independent refiner with several Gulf of Mexico sites, was the largest bidder by volume, offering to buy 6.9m barrels for between $105.62 and $109.76 a barrel.Vitol, the largest independent oil trader, bid for 4m barrels at $108.05, while Royal Dutch Shell bid for 3.65m barrels. Wall Street banks joined the auction. JPMorgan Chase, which last year acquired the global oil trading business of RBS Sempra Commodities, offered to buy 1.5m barrels for $158m, at $105.33 a barrel. Barclays, the UK bank, agreed to pay $104.98 a barrel for 200,000 barrels.“The oil was purchased for the purpose of supplying clients, principally refiners,” a JPMorgan spokeswoman said. Barclays declined to comment.The volume to be sold topped the largest previous emergency release from the reserve in 1990-91, when the government drew down 21m barrels in stocks after Iraq had invaded Kuwait.The extra supply comes when as much as 1.5m barrels a day has been lost in Libya, a leading producer of low-density crude that is easy to refine into petrol and diesel. US demand for motor fuels has declined from a year ago as drivers recoil from high prices.“There was no real shortage of crude oil available and demand is not growing rapidly in this country. It’s on par with the economic recovery in general,” a Valero spokesman said.This has led to speculation that some of the oil will end up stored as commercial stocks, rather than turned into fuels, after release into the market. Poten & Partners, a tanker broker, said inquiries to use tankers as so-called “floating storage” in the Gulf had picked up in recent days.
48;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;US becomes net exporter of fuel;;The US has become a net exporter of fuel for the first time for nearly 20 years as drivers struggle with high petrol prices.Energy department data show the world’s largest oil consumer in February shipped out 54,000 barrels more petroleum products each day than it purchased on the global market.After a five-year decline in net imports, the US became a net exporter in late 2010, a trend analysts say is confirmed by the latest data.The shift comes as Washington confronts voter frustration over petrol prices that have soared 36 per cent in the past year to nearly $4 per gallon, the highest level since mid-2008.Barack Obama, the US president, has called for an end to oil company tax breaks, while his attorney-general has launched a taskforce to investigate oil price manipulation.The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, reported US refined product exports rose 24.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2011 from a year ago, to 2.49m barrels per day. Imports declined 14.4 per cent to 2.16m b/d. The export increase is led by diesel and finished petrol, data from the Energy Information Administration show.For years the US was not only a net importer of crude oil but also of refined fuels. But oil demand of 19m b/d, while on the rebound, remains 2m b/d below pre-recession levels.Roads are also carrying less traffic than in 2007 and refiners have boosted fuel output.“Even though our consumption is up from where it was a year ago, we still have plenty available for export,” said Rayola Dougher, API senior economic adviser.The leading customers for US oil products are in Latin America, where refineries often cannot keep up with fuel consumption. Mexico relies heavily on US-made fuel. Ecuador, a member of the Opec oil cartel, is also a buyer.US refineries on the Gulf of Mexico are near these markets. Valero Energy, a US refiner, has told analysts petrol exports were fuelled by demand in Mexico and Brazil. “I do believe that we are seeing just a long-term trend here that’s going to allow Gulf Coast refiners to continue to export barrels,” said Joe Gorder, executive vice-president.Petrol in Gulf states such as Texas is cheaper than in east-coast cities such as New York and Boston. But it is often more profitable for traders to export it, said Philip Verleger, an independent oil economist. A pipeline connecting the Gulf to New York is fully booked, while federal law requires traders to hire expensive US-flagged vessels to ferry oil in domestic waters.Petrol exports have become a politically sensitive issue elsewhere as oil prices surge. Russia last week significantly increased petrol export tariffs in response to domestic fuel shortages.
49;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2011-04-05T21:34:14Z;High oil prices apply brake on drivers;;More and more drivers who stop at Shaji Mundackal’s Citgo station are getting out of the car to pump petrol themselves. The reason: it is 20 cents cheaper than the $4 per gallon full-service lane.Their frugal turn is anecdotal evidence that a sharp rebound in oil demand following the worst recession for decades could begin to flag as crude prices soar above $120 per barrel.Mr Mundackal’s business is in affluent Westchester county, outside New York city. Yet, even there, “people complain and say I’m not going to drive, I’m going to take a bus or a train,” he says.A slowdown in oil consumption growth could temper prices that have surged on supply shutdowns in Libya and elsewhere. Global oil demand last year rose to a record 87.9m barrels per day, snapping back after two straight years of decline.Nobody is predicting a decline in demand this year. But high prices are forcing a rethink on the pace of consumption.At a global level, Eduardo Lopez, senior oil analyst at the Paris-based International Energy Agency, says the only effect of higher prices so far is “somewhat less vigorous demand growth.” But this could change, as oil price shocks take time to seep into consumption patterns and data on demand are reported months later. “Down the road, if prices continue to be high, we will probably see the effects,” says Mr Lopez.Two other factors are likely to affect the demand outlook. One of those is subsidies. In some major oil exporters including Saudi Arabia, drivers are shielded from price rises. India, an importer, recently lifted price controls for petrol but kept them for diesel, insulating fuel consumers from higher crude costs.Another is currencies. Because oil is priced in dollars, currency fluctuations can add to or subtract from a country’s petrol bill. For example, the weaker pound has contributed to a record high in UK petrol and diesel prices in sterling terms. By contrast, in Japan, the third-largest oil consumer, the yen’s appreciation will water down oil costs as the country tries to rebuild after last month’s earthquake.But the biggest effect from higher oil prices on demand might come indirectly, in the form of a drag on output.“Everybody’s concerned about the impact on economic recovery,” says Antoine Halff, oil analyst at the US Energy Information Administration in Washington. “You have to worry about prices that turn into an excessively heavy burden.”Analysts are focusing their attention on the US and China, the world’s biggest oil consumers.In the US, petrol demand is slightly below last year’s levels. The price at the pump, after climbing 30 per cent from a year ago, is fast approaching peaks reached in 2008 – when, as Olivier Jakob of consultants Petromatrix notes, the unemployment rate was much lower than it is today.James Hamilton, economist at the University of California, San Diego, says household energy spending is back to 2008 levels. As the traditional summer “driving season” approaches, Tesoro, a US refiner, warns petrol consumption patterns have been “lacklustre at best”. Valero, another refiner, says drivers have begun to abandon high-octane fuels for regular grade, a sign price increases are beginning to bite.“As gasoline prices move higher, the burden on American households will rise further and demand growth is likely to stall if not turn negative,” says Harry Tchilinguirian, commodity strategist at BNP Paribas in London.China, where oil demand rose 12 per cent last year, may be a different story. Analysts believe higher oil prices will have only limited impact as Chinese demand tops 10m b/d for the first time.Yingxi Yu, analyst with Barclays Capital, says that income is a much more important factor for oil demand growth in China than price elasticity. “As long as income grows, Chinese oil demand will be able to grow,” she says.The government’s pricing system could underpin demand. Because prices charged at the pump for refined products such as petrol and diesel are set by the state, high international oil prices can take time to filter down to Chinese petrol stations, if they filter down at all.Drivers in Beijing say they are feeling the pinch from high prices. But it does not seem to have prompted big changes in their behaviour just yet.“Petrol in America is so much cheaper than here,” laments one company driver as he fills up a silver minivan at a Sinopec station in Beijing, where the price of standard petrol is Rmb7.93 per litre. “I’ve personally started taking the bus more often during the last two years,” he says.Behind him, though, waits a black sedan with tinted windows, whose driver scoffs at the impact of higher petrol prices. “It doesn’t make any difference at all for us, since this is a public vehicle,” the driver says. “Maybe the common people are worried about high prices, but not us.”One big question mark hanging over China’s oil demand however is the rate at which Beijing will fill its strategic petroleum reserves, which are potentially a huge source of demand. High crude imports in January and February suggest that some stockpiling was taking place early this year, and analysts say that events in the Middle East could prompt the filling of the reserve to be accelerated. Others however believe that purchases of oil for the reserve are more sensitive to price and could slow down if the price of crude remains high.

The index is still down 0.9 per cent from its mid-February highs.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.6 per cent to 12,258.20, its biggest one-day gain since December 1, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.8 per cent to 2,789.74.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, tumbled 10.5 per cent, although it is still up 12.6 per cent since February 22 when the market began to react sharply to the Mideast crisis.Sentiment was aided by unexpectedly strong weekly employment numbers. Unemployment claims fell to their lowest level since May 2008 last week, declining by 20,000 from the previous week to 368,000. The less volatile four-week
moving average was down 13,000, to 388,000 claims.“The underlying downtrend in initial jobless claims is undeniable and provides strong evidence that the labour market recovery is for real,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The data bodes well for the official non-farm payroll figures which come out on Friday. Economists are expecting that about 192,000 jobs will have been created in February, well ahead of the 36,000 created in the previous month.Separate data from the Institute for Supply Management showed strong growth in activity in the US service sector. The ISM non-manufacturing index was up to 59.7 from 59.4 theprevious month, which was the highest reading since August 2005. A reading over 50 indicates expansion.Shares in News Corp rose after it was given permission by the British government to buy the rest of the British Sky Broadcasting Group.Jeremy Hunt, UK culture secretary, said he was minded to wave through News Corp’s £8.3bn proposed bid for the 61 per cent of BSkyB that it does not already own, on the condition that it spins off Sky News as a separate listed company.The deal will go to a short consultation period but, as it stands, News Corp will avoid a lengthy referral to the Competition Commission and negotiations on a final price for BSkyB will begin. Shares in News Corp were up 1.6 per cent to $17.64.That helped lift the media sector, which was up 2.2 per cent in the session.

51;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2011-02-10T21:16:56Z;Divergence puts oil traders on different track;;Every day a freight train lumbers a thousand miles from one remote US town to another, bearing cargoes that are reshaping the global oil market.Each train hauls 72,000 barrels of crude from Stanley, North Dakota to a depot near Cushing, Oklahoma, where benchmark US oil prices are set.This scene, a throwback in an age of pipelines, shows how quickly the dynamics of oil trading can change. In just two years, North Dakota has doubled production to become the US’s fourth-largest producing state, forcing oil companies to hire trains to move what they cannot squeeze into pipes.The surge in inflows from North Dakota, as well as neighbouring Canada, has swelled oil stocks at Cushing, the delivery point for West Texas Intermediate on the Nymex exchange, the world’s most widely traded oil futures.But as these crude inventories have risen, the price of WTI, Nymex’s flagship contract, has weakened substantially compared to crudes of comparable quality, such as Light Louisiana Sweet and Brent, the North Sea benchmark.On Thursday Brent’s premium over WTI reached a record of more than $16 a barrel. That divergence is wreaking havoc among energy investors and traders. It has already prompted Saudi Arabia two years ago to drop WTI as its benchmark for pricing oil to customers in the US.Indeed, dispatches at the time from the US embassy in Riyadh, obtained by the website WikiLeaks, quoted Prince Abdulaziz, Saudi’s deputy oil minister, describing the WTI market as “too much like gambling”. According to the cables, Saudi officials explained to US diplomats that the shift to a new benchmark would leave the kingdom “less subject to speculative price swings”.The disparities between WTI and other crudes are complicating everything from the hedging of energy costs to investing in commodities.Valero, the largest independent US refiner, has admitted it had “underestimated” the price spread, saying WTI has “almost become irrelevant” as a benchmark. Commodity index investors, with $42bn bet on WTI, have also been affected: while Brent is up 5.6 per cent over the past month, the Texas blend has declined 2.1 per cent.The problem for Cushing, known as the “pipeline crossroads of the world”, is that it has no major pipelines to evacuate oil beyond nearby refineries. So stocks in the town’s tanks have risen to a record 38.3m barrels. This glut will probably worsen when a new pipeline extension adds 155,000 barrels a day from Canada.The trains are adding to the surplus. Drillers in North Dakota have used new technology to tap the oil-drenched Bakken geological formation. The state’s production has since reached a record 355,000 b/d in November, double the 2008 average. That bonanza has boosted oil supplies in the midwest region around Cushing to the highest in three decades, even as local refinery demand has remained roughly steady.The North Dakota oil is “light,” meaning that it yields more highly valued gasoline than “heavier” oils. “Our marketing guy calls it Gucci crude,” says John Kelso of Whiting Petroleum, the second-largest oil producer in North Dakota. But this “Gucci” oil also happens to cost about $4 less than WTI, according to Platts, the energy and metals information service.Traders have been mixing it with other types of crude inside some of Cushing’s 55m barrels worth of tanks and creating a blend that can be delivered against WTI contracts. Many traders have been storing the oil for months, too, a profitable business because spot WTI prices are lower than those for future delivery.Philip Verleger, an energy economist, says those with access to cheap financing and Cushing’s tanks can “lock in an annual risk-free return of almost 100 per cent”.But there are signs this pattern will reverse. Valero said it has been “running as much WTI as we can” in some refineries, helping to temper the Cushing stocks rise. Traders have begun to bypass Cushing by placing oil on trains headed to Gulf of Mexico hubs such as Saint James, Louisiana, where prices are higher, says Denis Smith of BNSF Railway.Pipeline companies are responding with projects on the drawing board to connect Cushing to Gulf Coast markets. But these projects will take years to develop. The wide spreads may persist for a while yet.
52;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2011-01-27T18:57:37Z;Smart investors are avoiding WTI;;"How much oil can be extracted from shale in North Dakota? This is exactly the sort of question commodity index investors hoped to avoid.Yet this, along with pipeline issues and refinery shutdowns, is a big influence on the West Texas Intermediate crude price, which on Thursday traded at a record discount of more than $12 to Brent, the North Sea benchmark. Anyone with oil futures linked to WTI and its hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, is wishing they had chosen Brent, sensitive to global demand, not just the US midwest.WTI investors are suffering from its futures contracts too. They are in steep contango, meaning it costs much more to buy oil for delivery further in the future, unlike Brent. Since investors buy futures contracts, hold them and then sell them for further forward contracts, this means buying WTI high and selling low.This is not just a little local difficulty. WTI is the most heavily traded commodity future, and is over a third of the S&P GSCI, the best-known commodity index. Brent is only 14 per cent of the index, so underperformance by WTI hurts tracker funds. With $90bn-$100bn tracking the GSCI, this hits a lot of investors.The WTI discount and contango has a huge effect on oil-tracking exchange-traded funds. The US Oil Fund, for example, is down 8.5 per cent since the start of last year, even as the price of WTI for delivery in a month has risen a tad to $87. Front month Brent futures, by contrast, are up 13.7 per cent to $98 because of their exposure to global demand; Brent ETFs are up as much.Some in the oil industry treat WTI with scepticism. Joe Gorder, head of marketing and supply at Valero Energy, the US refiner, said this week that WTI should be dropped as a benchmark as it has “almost become irrelevant”.Smart investors have long realised that high trading volumes in WTI futures says little about their role in a long-term portfolio. They are right to steer clear."
53;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2011-01-13T18:38:59Z;Marathon splits off refineries from exploration;;"Marathon Oil, the fourth-biggest integrated US oil and gas company, is to split into two by separating its refinery and pipeline operations from its exploration and production business.The move, which sent Marathon’s share price up $3.31, more than 8 per cent, to $43.84, joins a flurry of demergers of US groups including one announced by industrial conglomerate ITT this week. Marathon Petroleum – a newly-created company – will be the fifth-biggest refiner in the US; while Marathon Oil will focus solely on global exploration and production, with growth leveraged to crude oil production.David Pursell, head of Macro Research at Tudor Pickering Holt, the energy investment and merchant banking firm, said that as an integrated group, Marathon has had difficulty standing out.It is too small for investors to consider it a rival to other integrated groups, such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell. The split will allow each company to act in the best interest of its business segment, better attract talent and allow for more specific comparisons against competitors.Marathon’s exploration and production business can now be compared against companies such as EnCana and EOG Resources. Its refining business can be measured against pure refiners, such as Valero.“The market clearly likes the announcement,’’ Mr Pursell said.“This is a vote of confidence for other companies with similar assets to follow.’’Investors have supported other splits, including that by EnCana in 2009 and Questar in 2010. There has been talk of BP and ConocoPhillips demerging but analysts say the effort is more difficult and offers less value for companies of their scale.Marathon’s decision to split follows a long period of consideration that ended two years ago with a decision to remain integrated amid the financial crisis. “The substantial improvement in the global business and financial environments over the past two years has created the conditions under which we believe it is now appropriate to move forward with the formation of two strong independent energy companies,’’ said Clarence Cazalot Jr, Marathon president and chief executive.Marathon’s market value at Wednesday’s closing price was about $28.8bn. The company plans to distribute one share of Marathon Petroleum for every two shares of Marathon Oil. Marathon Oil will pay an initial divided of 15 cents per quarter, based on about 710m shares outstanding, and Marathon Petroleum will pay 20 cents per quarter, based on about 355m shares outstanding.The spin-off is expected to be tax-free and effective from June 30.Moody’s Investors Service placed Marathon’s Baa1 senior unsecured bond rating under review for possible downgrade, noting that the split would reduce scale and eliminate benefits of integration. Morgan Stanley is acting as financial adviser, Baker Botts as legal adviser and Bingham McCutchen as tax adviser."
54;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Schwarzenegger raps ‘black oil hearts’;;As energy companies try to roll back California’s carbon legislation, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor, accuses them of greed in their “black oil hearts”.The governor spearheaded legislation four years ago that established California as a global clean energy leader , requiring it to cut greenhouse gas emissions 30 per cent by 2020. The economy was strong at the time and the US appeared poised to pass similar regulation nationally. But the economic downturn has undermined national efforts to pass energy legislation and is leading to questions over whether California can afford to begin those set to go on its books in January.“This is not the time to layer on this expensive global warming legislation,’’ said Anita Mangels, spokeswoman for Proposition 23. The measure, to be voted on by Californians in the November 2 election, would delay implementation of carbon regulations until the state’s unemployment rate falls to 5.5 per cent and stays that way for a year. It is 12.4 per cent.The lead backers are Valero Energy and Tesoro, which own four California refineries and say the regulations would cost the state more than 1.1m jobs, raise electricity rates up to 60 per cent and result in $3.7bn more in higher gasoline and diesel prices. “California’s economy is in deep trouble,’’ said Bill Klesse and Greg Goff, the respective chief executives of Valero and Tesoro, in a joint letter to California newspapers. “Let the voters weigh the cost of climate change rules and decide if they want to bear that cost right now.’’Mr Schwarzenegger is lobbying against efforts to pass Proposition 23 in an effort to protect his legislative legacy as his term as governor nears an end. “Does anyone really believe that these companies, out of the goodness of their black oil hearts, are spending millions and millions of dollars to protect jobs?’’ he said last week.Many in the industry warn that a lack of legislative certainty nationally endangers the renewables boom. “The attack from the Texas oil companies has had a chilling effect on sentiment around clean energy,’’ said Dan Adler, president of CalCEF, a non-profit venture capital fund formed to accelerate development of clean energy technologies.Tom Arnold, vice-president of Energy Efficiency and Carbon Solutions at EnerNOC, an energy management firm, said investors needed long-term policy certainty. “It would be very frustrating to have a policy that ebbs and flows with the unemployment rate.’’Royal Dutch Shell said the regulatory uncertainty introduced by Proposition 23 would make it difficult for businesses to plan.The end result would be lost jobs, including those in SPG Solar, said Tom Rooney, chief executive of the company that designs and installs solar photovoltaic systems.“It’s certainly a threat,’’ said Tim Raphael, regional representative for the American Wind Energy Association.Ken Medlock, energy expert at the James A Baker III Institute for Public Policy, said the battle over Proposition 23 was indicative of a looming national controversy over whether cleaning up the environment was bad for the economy. “It’s going to be difficult for people to swallow a pill that we are going to try to become cleaner at the expense of economic gains.’’While the Obama administration is supporting renewables, with new solar panelling on the White House and plans to build the first solar plants on federal lands in California, Congress has proved resistant to new measures.“Almost every US renewable company is really, really hurting right now,’’ said Kevin Shaw, energy lawyer at Mayer Brown. He added that most projects “don’t make short-term economic sense and can only be justified from a long-term policy standpoint”.
55;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2010-09-12T21:47:41Z;Biofuels: Alternative fuels fail to live up to the hype;;In the search for new feedstocks to provide the fuels of the future, one of the latest ideas is to use dirty nappies. Amec, the UK-based engineering group, is developing a process to use discarded disposable nappies and other plastic materials that are not now recycled to make a synthetic diesel fuel.The US Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that 3.8m tons of disposable nappies were discarded in 2008, representing about 1.5 per cent of the country’s total municipal waste.If they could be used for fuel, that could make a useful contribution to what Amec calls “a future where trash is a thing of the past”, as well as helping meet demand for energy.Unfortunately, the process is still at the testing stage, and the stories of other similar technologies show that demonstrating technical possibilities is very different from establishing commercial viability.The technical difficulties of scaling up production are prodigious, leaving the hopes of the industry as yet unfulfilled.There will be a need for liquid fuels, especially in transport, for many decades, and in a world of finite oil reserves and pressure to curb carbon dioxide emissions, a growing proportion of those are likely to be biofuels.To play a central role in the energy system of the future, however, biofuels will need to be different from the varieties that are generally available today.First generation biofuels, such as ethanol from corn and sugar, and biodiesel from vegetable oils, are now well established in many developed countries, often encouraged by generous subsidies and supportive regulations, but their drawbacks have become increasingly evident.In spite of a recent study published by the World Bank that suggested that biofuels played only a small part in the surge in food prices of 2006-08, there have been persistent concerns about diverting agricultural resources towards fuel production.As a result, there has been an increasingly intensive search for new feedstocks and processes, and in the past couple of years large international oil groups including ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP have stepped up their commitment to research and development of advanced biofuels.Several of the companies developing second-generation biofuels, those not produced from food crops, claim to be close to commercial deployment, yet delivery of large volumes of their products is still many years away.Confident-sounding predictions of commercial production have frequently turned out to be over-optimistic, and in a sign of how realism has set in, the US government has cut sharply its targets for the use of advanced biofuels.Legislation in 2007 set a goal for consumption of cellulosic ethanol, made from plants such as switchgrass, straw or wood chips, of 100m gallons for 2010, and 250m gallons for 2011. This year those goals have been scaled back to just 6.5m gallons for 2010, and up to 17.1m gallons for 2011.If reached, next year’s upper limit would still represent only about 0.1 per cent of total US biofuel consumption, which is expected to be just under 8 per cent of total transport fuel usage.Only a handful of companies are expected to be delivering cellulosic ethanol in the US next year, of which the largest is set to be Maryland-based Fiberight, which started production in May at its Blairstown, Iowa, plant, initially using pulp wastes from a local paper factory.The second-largest could be Indiana-based Agresti Biofuels, again producing ethanol from waste, and the next could be California-based AE Biofuels, which has a plant producing conventional corn ethanol, butt plans to use it to create a rising proportion of cellulosic ethanol from straw.The preliminary and tentative nature of even these plans – the tattered remnants of the high hopes of three years ago – are a warning of how difficult the large-scale production of advanced biofuels is likely to be.Shell and BP have continued to increase their research and development into advanced biofuels, but have also both formed large joint-ventures to produce conventional ethanol from sugar cane in Brazil, which is both the cheapest and probably the most environmentally friendly variety of first generation biofuels – in terms of carbon dioxide emissions.While progress towards the second generation falters, the first generation industry in the US – mostly corn-based ethanol – has been through a bruising time, squeezed between the volatility of fuel prices and corn prices, which this summer hit their highest levels for more than a year.Refiners such as Valero have used the weakness of the ethanol industry as an opportunity to buy plants for a fraction of what they cost to build.The US biofuels industry still enjoys strong political support, but is facing two critical political decisions in the next few months: whether to lift the limit on ethanol content in standard petrol from its present maximum of 10 per cent – a controversial issue because of the potential adverse impact on engines, particularly of older cars – and whether to renew the 45 cents a gallon tax credit paid to ethanol blenders.If those decisions go the way the industry wants, US biofuels consumption will continue to grow.The new fuels that could replace corn-based ethanol and provide a long-term large-scale alternative to conventional petrol, diesel and jet fuel, however, remain a distant prospect.
56;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2010-08-26T19:59:26Z;US goes down a gear on use of oil;Consumers are driving less and easing up on the accelerator;Evidence of a slowdown in the US economy is turning up in oil markets as demand stagnates in the world’s most voracious petroleum consuming nation.US petroleum stockpiles are at their highest levels since the early 1980s, the energy department revealed this week, and the rapid rebound in demand from the recessionary lows of a year ago has begun to decelerate.Americans are consuming less oil than they did in 2008 – or most of the previous decade, for that matter.Demand for petrol, crucial to a car-dependent US, has gained a meagre 0.5 per cent year to date, according to energy department data.US refiners are, meanwhile, exporting hundreds of thousands of barrels of unwanted diesel to Latin America each day.Oil prices have dropped 9 per cent in August and neared $70 a barrel this week on a drumbeat of negative headlines, such as evaporating US home sales.While energy traders complain that stock markets are steering oil markets – not supply and demand fundamentals – the same factors affect both.“We have seen crude prices back off quite a bit over the past couple of weeks,” says John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group in Washington.“That suggests that the US economy, which is an important part of the share of the world market for crude, is slowing down and the world is reacting to it,” he adds.Crude oil is refined into fuels in usable form, notably petrol, diesel and jet fuel.Consumption patterns for each tell a story about the US economy.Petrol, or gasoline, is burned primarily in cars. With the US unemployment rate persistently high, Americans are driving less.Roadway traffic through June was virtually unchanged from last year, moving at volumes witnessed in 2005, according to the Federal Highway Administration.“Gasoline is really a function of the retail side of the economy,” says Mr Felmy.His organisation’s own statistics show petrol consumption lower than in 2009. “People drive to buy stuff, they drive for holidays, they drive for jobs. All the indications from things such as consumer confidence and retail sales are consistent with that story.”Distillate fuel, mainly diesel, is primarily used in trucks, buses and trains in the US and its use is thus symptomatic of industrial activity.The American Trucking Associations’ tonnage index fell for two straight months in May and June, though for the year to date it is up 6.6 per cent from 2009.The industry group blames the sequential declines on a slowing economy. US factories have slowed down for three months running.Distillates “represents the supply of goods and services around the country”, says Andy Lipow, president of consultant Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.“As long as the consumer is holding back their spending, predominantly spending on necessities, it’s very difficult to get major growth [in demand],” he adds.Jet fuel data are mixed. The Air Transport Association industry group reported that, through June, US carriers consumed 1.3 per cent less than the same period last year while, in July, fewer people flew.More recent figures from the energy department point to a 0.8 per cent rise in jet consumption this year.Strong growth in emerging markets such as China are still likely to push global oil demand to a record high 86.6m barrels a day this year, the International Energy Agency predicts.The US, in spite of its doldrums, constitutes 22 per cent of that. This has led many analysts to forecast higher oil prices.Analysts polled by Bloomberg expect benchmark US crude to average $87 a barrel next year.Yet Barclays Capital on Thursday lowered its crude price forecast to $85 next year from $92 as US data retain “something of a magnified iconic status in setting oil market sentiment”, the bank says.Meanwhile, the US is exporting fuels, especially distillates, as producers have cranked up operating rates.Valero, the biggest US refiner, has been sending hundreds of thousands of barrels a day to South America. The exports partly reflect refinery outages there. But the company also says demand in the US could be stronger.“We need the economy to get going here,” Bill Klesse, chief executive, has told analysts. “We need people to get back to work.”
57;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2010-01-27T15:28:16Z;Valero swings to a loss in 2009;;Valero, the biggest US refiner, swung to a loss in 2009, underling the dramatic unravelling of the US refining industry.The company reported a $55m loss from continuing operations on Wednesday, down from income of $2.8bn in 2008, excluding special items.The economic downturn and a move toward renewables and energy conservation cut into operations, forcing Valero to shut down unprofitable capacity across its fleet.In the fourth quarter of 2009, it closed its Delaware City refinery, responding to a 58 per cent drop in margins per barrel.The result was a a net loss of $1.41bn, or $2.51 a share, in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with a prior-year quarterly loss of $3.28bn, or $6.36 a share.For the full year, the net loss was $1.98bn, widening from a net loss of $1.13bn in 2008.Valero’s revenue rose 5.8 per cent to $18.87bn in the fourth quarter, even as refining output fell 15 per cent.For the full 2009 year, however, revenue was $68.14bn, down 40 per cent from $113.14bn in 2008.“Weak demand, narrow margins and low discounts in the fourth quarter exemplified how difficult refining conditions were in 2009,’’ said Bill Klesse, Valero’s chairman and chief executive.He said that while 2009 might have been the “bottom’’ for refining profitability, there remains too much inventory and spare refining capacity for margins to rebound quickly.“Economic growth will help demand recover in 2010, but we also expect new refining capacity to come online in the US and around the world,’’ Mr Klesse said. “Therefore, 2010 is expected to be another challenging year for the industry, while refiners close marginal capacity and wait for demand growth to work down spare capacity.’’The industry has come to the same conclusion, leading Chevron to announce last week that it was restructuring its global refining and marketing operations and would cut an unspecified number of jobs.Future prospects for the industry, while still unclear, are grim if one takes into account potential carbon legislation and a move toward renewables, both of which will hit the refining and marketing segment.A report by Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, late last year said carbon legislation being considered by Congress was more onerous than its counterpart in Europe and could threaten the sustainability of the US refining industry.If passed into law, the legislation could cost US refiners $100bn per year within three years, said Alan Gelder, Wood MacKenzie’s head of global downstream oil consulting.
58;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2009-12-11T06:37:35Z;Valero seals biofuel deal with Australia’s Mission;;Valero Energy, the US’s biggest independent refiner, has signed a five-year deal, worth up to $3.5bn, to buy biodiesel from Mission NewEnergy, an Australia-listed biodiesel refiner.The agreement also gives Valero the right to buy up to 25 per cent of Mission at A$0.45 per common share, representing a 61 per cent premium to the current 30-day price. Mission’s share price closed at A$0.33 on December 8, 2009.On news of the announcement, Mission’s shares jumped up to 21.1 per cent in morning trading in Australia, as investors grew excited at the prospects of a biodiesel project getting off the ground.The biodiesel sector has been among the big victims of the credit crisis, with companies unwilling to lend to or buy into a new and unproven fuel given the uncertainty of returns. That Valero is making this investment could signal renewed interest in this segment.In the second quarter of 2010, Mission is to begin supplying Valero up to 200,000 tonnes (60m gallons) of biodiesel per year. Valero can double that amount to 400,000 tonnes per year and extend the term by an additional five years.The agreement represents gross revenue potential to Mission of over US$3.5bn, based on prevailing market prices, maximum volume and contract life.Mission will begin by supplying biodiesel from palm oil. But it is one of the world’s biggest Jatropha plantation companies by acreage, and it plans eventually to supply the fuel from Jatropha feedstock.Jatropha is an inedible perennial oil seed plant that grows on marginal soil without displacing agricultural land used for food supply, making it an ecologically responsible source of fuel oil. As Mission’s available stock of Jatropha matures to scale, Mission will supply Valero with palm oil-based biodiesel.The agreement follows a year of discussions and detailed testing of Mission produced palm- and Jatropha-based biodiesel in Valero’s US laboratories.Valero said the agreement is one in a series of deals and investments Valero has made in alternative and renewable fuels companies.Indeed, in March Valero won a bankruptcy auction for seven VeraSun Energy ethanol production plants and one development site for $477m, which valued the assets at about 40 per cent of replacement cost.Mission is to issue Valero two tranches of warrants to purchase common stock. The first, of 81.41m warrants, will expire on Augst 31 2010, and if fully exercised will provide Mission with A$36.6m.The second will be issued to allow Valero to maintain its equity stake of 25 per cent, based on the conversion of any of the other outstanding Mission convertible securities.Tranche-two warrants are exercisable at a 20 per cent discount to the 20-day volume-weighted average price prior to the date of exercise and are capped at a maximum of 68.58m, expiring September 30 2012.Mission is considering various financing options to meet its funding needs, given the size and scope of the supply agreement.
59;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Wall Street slips on recovery fears;;Most US stocks closed lower on Tuesday as losses ran into a third consecutive day as strong demand in a US Treasury auction and weak consumer confidence numbers reignited fears about the economic recovery.The S&P 500 fell 0.33 per cent to 1,063.41. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1.20 per cent to 2,116.09.However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.14 per cent to 9,882.17, helped by strong performance from blue-chips, such as International Business Machines and Exxon Mobil.Even some stronger than expected corporate results and a firm oil price, which pushed above $79 a barrel, could not lift many stocks.US Steel saw some of the heaviest losses, falling 7.8 per cent to $37.41, in spite of its better than expected results. The company posted a smaller than expected loss. Its shares were hit by worries over demand over the coming months, particularly for flat-rolled steel from US car makers following the end of Detroit’s “cash for clunkers” programme.Alcoa and Walt Disney lost more than 1 per cent after US consumer confidence numbers came in below estimates. Alcoa fell 3.54 per cent to $12.81 and Walt Disney was down 1.68 per cent to $28.17.Johnson Controls said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit surged, but its shares fell 4.76 per cent to $25.03, also on worries over demand. Valero Energy posted its third loss in four quarters, triggering a 4.34 per cent fall in its shares to $19.39.Stocks suffered as big demand for US Treasuries in a two-year auction raised doubts among some investors over the economy. Bidding for the $44bn on offer in two-year Treasuries was the highest in two years, according to analysts.The economic data was mixed, but most investors focused on the consumer confidence numbers, which unexpectedly fell in October for the second consecutive month. The Conference Board’s index fell to 47.7, weaker than the consensus expectation of a reading of 53.1. Confidence was hit by growing concerns that job market conditions would worsen in the near term, analysts said.However, Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller Composite index of home prices rose 1.2 per cent in August on the month, above expectations. That helped slow the annual pace of declines in the main 20-city index to 11.3 per cent.IBM shares rose 0.45 per cent to $19.39 after it approved an additional $5bn in stock repurchasesBP’s third-quarter results, beat third-quarter earnings forecasts, sent its shares up 4.22 per cent to $57.82. Shares in other oil majors, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, also rose, up 2.29 per cent to $74.91 and up 1.51 per cent to $76.59 respectively.Most analysts expect the US to escape recession with third quarter gross domestic product expected to rise more than 3 per cent, when the data are published tomorrow.Aircraft maker Textron was one of the best performing stocks as its shares rose 7.14 per cent to $19.67 after it posted unexpected profits.The company, which makes Cessna airplanes and Bell helicopters, made big savings from job cuts, helping to compensate for reduced production.Profit from continuing operations excluding some costs was 12 cents a share, beating the average Wall Street estimate.Analysts warned that equities could face continuing pressure over the next month as most of the good news from stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings over the past two weeks has now been priced into the market.The S&P 500 is up 3.7 per cent since October 1 and 57 per cent since its March 9 low this year.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: “It will be really hard for the market to go much higher from here. The market may well edge lower over next few weeks.“I don’t think we will get a true sense of where stocks or the economy is going until we get retail sales numbers following Thanksgiving at the end of November.”Peter Cardillo, chief market strategist at Avalon Partners, added: “Investors are going to be cautious. We might see some profit-taking from here until there are clearer signs of where the economy is going.”
60;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2009-10-19T18:06:10Z;Diesel stockpiles could derail crude’s rally;;For many months, crude has fluctuated between $65 and $75 a barrel even as other risky assets, from stocks to gold, have taken off.But last week oil broke free, passing $75 for the first time in a year.The rally continued on Monday, with the US crude contract for delivery in December, the most active, flirting with the $80 a barrel level after eight consecutive days of gains.Analysts have taken note.Barclays Capital, an oil bull, bid a “final farewell” to the “long, comfortable $65-$75 band and …hello to the $70-$80 band”.Hopes that the worst of the economic crisis is over after better-than-expected third-quarter corporate profits in the US, the arrival of winter in the northern hemisphere when demand picks up, and a weaker US dollar have contributed to the surge.Oil’s nascent rally could, nonetheless, be washed out by rivers of diesel.Demand for diesel, burned in trucks, locomotives and construction equipment, is an important reflection of economic activity. Yet while consumption should pick up as the economy recovers, big stockpiles of the fuel and others like it could keep the price of crude in check.JPMorgan cautioned that “while we can justify the rally, we do not trust it”.In the US, stockpiles of middle distillates (which, alongside diesel, includes heating oil) are at their highest in decades. Europe faces a surplus of distillates so great that traders are booking tankers to store it offshore after running out of inland deposits.The International Energy Agency, the industrialised countries’ oil watchdog, says the volume of refined oil products in floating storage offshore Europe rose 25 per cent in September. In Asia, diesel stocks are rising fast, with inventories in the Singapore hub trebling since August to a record.“The world has yet to come to terms with the massive middle distillate stock surplus,” JBC Energy, the Vienna-based oil consultancy, says.A quarterly statement from CSX, the US railway operator seen as a bellwether of the country’s industrial and trade activity, points to weak distillates demand.CSX locomotives used 18 per cent less fuel in the most recent quarter than in the same period a year ago.Lower distillate consumption means less need for the crude from which it is derived and could translate into lower prices.Chris Thorpe of Hudson Capital Energy, a New York options dealer that works with oil refiners, resellers and large manufacturers, says he has yet to hear of “any physical players seeing significant demand improvement”.Most analysts say oil demand will pick up in 2010 after two years of decline. US drivers are pumping 5 per cent more petrol – the other big oil product alongside distillate – than last year, according to official data.But the diesel glut has forced refineries to shut down or scale back.In the US, they were running at about 80 per cent of capacity, a rate that could fall to the 70 per cent range, Valero Energy, the largest independent US refiner, said last month.The cutbacks will restrain the world’s thirst for crude and cap surging prices.“If you look at the fundamentals, we still have very high inventories. Refining margins are dire,” says Sean Corrigan, chief investment strategist at Diapason Commodities Management, a $6bn asset manager in Lausanne, Switzerland.“Demand seems to have stabilised. That’s the best we can say,” he adds.Some analysts are confident oil prices are headed higher. A day before oil pierced $75 last week, Goldman Sachs said the market was “poised for a break-out”, identifying goods shipped for Christmas from Asia to the west as the wild card that could rescue diesel demand and push oil prices higher.“All indicators still point to a normal seasonal pick-up in shipping to retailers this year,” the bank said.Given Goldman’s reputation as Wall Street’s largest oil trader, some observers said the call was a self-fulfilling prophecy. The bank predicts $85-a-barrel crude by early next year and $95 by December 2010.Deutsche Bank, which forecasts $75 crude for early 2010, says a steadily weakening dollar points to higher prices. Since oil is priced in dollars, a weaker US currency suggests a higher nominal price.“It now looks like the dollar is driving oil prices once again,” the bank said in a note. “The prospect of fresh lows in the US dollar will exacerbate this trend.”But even the most bullish analysts are not predicting a near-term price spike comparable to last year’s run to almost $150 a barrel.Opec’s spare capacity is now more than 5m barrels a day, three times the amount estimated as crude spiked last year.“As long as there’s that much slack, there’s no immediate need for oil prices to skyrocket in the spot market,” says John Brynjolfsson, chief investment officer at Armored Wolf, a California-based global macro hedge fund.The cartel has indicated it is satisfied with prices at around $80. Higher prices could encourage some members to flout official levels or even convince Saudi Arabia to push for a formal production increase at Opec’s meeting in December.Either of these moves would damp crude prices and derail the rally above $75 a barrel.
61;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2009-10-14T21:15:37Z;Wall St hits fresh 2009 highs;;US stock markets hit fresh 2009 highs on Wednesday, with Dow Jones Industrial Average reclaiming the 10,000 mark, after a smaller-than-expected decline in retail sales and strong earnings at a leading bank.Financial, industrial and materials stocks boosted the market while the telecoms sector was a laggard.The S&P 500 stock index closed up 1.8 per cent at 1,092.02, a new 2009 high. The Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.5 per cent to 2,172.23.The Dow gained 1.5 per cent to 10,015.86, the first five-digit close since October 3, 2008.“It’s a landmark,” said Marc Pado, US market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “It makes for good headlines and positive feelings, which is very important at this time of year. The consumer has to feel things are on the mend if they are going to go out and shop.”The Dow first broke through 10,000 in March 1999, and after the bear market earlier this decade, rose back above 10,000 in December 2003. But it still remains 29 per cent below its record closing high of 14,164.53 set in October 2007.The Dow has rallied more than 50 per cent from its March low, but its performance has lagged behind other US equity benchmarks so far this year.In the year to date, the Dow is up 14.1 per cent, while the S&P 500 has risen 20.9 per cent and the Nasdaq is up 37.7 per cent. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks has gained 24.9 per cent.U, stung by a slump in motor vehicle purchases as government-sponsored incentives ended. But the 1.5 per cent decline, the biggest since December, was less than the 2.1 per cent analysts had expected.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, said conventional Wall Street wisdom held that the market was “way ahead” of the economic recovery. “What is really going on is exactly the opposite: the reason this thing keeps going up is economic fundamentals are improving far more rapidly than Wall Street’s perceptions.”Analysts at Capital Economics said the sales data will likely allow consumption to contribute to growth in the third quarter, but warned rising unemployment, falling incomes and tight credit “mean that a renewed period of weak consumption growth will undermine the sustainability of the economic recovery”.The market also reacted to a strong set of third-quarter earnings reports. JPMorgan on Wednesday said that profits surged in the quarter on the strength of its investment banking business, but cautioned recent signs of consumer credit stability might be fleeting.Net income climbed to $3.6bn, or 82 cents a share, from $527m, or 9 cents, in the same period a year ago. Wall Street analysts were predicting that the bank would earn 52 cents a share on revenues of $24.7bn. The results pushed the bank’s shares up by 3.3 per cent to $47.16.The first of the big US banks to report third-quarter earnings, JPMorgan raised expectations for forthcoming results from other banks.Goldman Sachs overcame a Tuesday sell-off after an analyst downgraded her recommendation for the stock.Goldman rose 2.7 per cent to $192.28, while Morgan Stanley climbed 5.4 per cent to $32.83. Bank of America ended the day 4.4 per cent higher at $18.59.Intel, the world’s biggest computer chipmaker, rose 1.7 per cent to $20.83 after beating earnings expectations late on Tuesday. The company pointed to a strong holiday sales season for the computer industry.Intel’s results boosted hopes of strong third-quarter performances from technology companies. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices rose 2.8 per cent to $6.25.Google closed up 1.8 per cent to $535.32, while IBM rose 1.1 per cent to $128.35. Both companies report their results on Thursday.Valero Energy, the US’s largest oil refiner, lost 1.9 per cent to $18.81 as crude oil settled above $75 a barrel for the first time this year, threatening to crimp profit margins.
62;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2009-08-17T19:29:42Z;Essar bids for three Shell refineries in Europe;;Essar, the Indian conglomerate, has bid for three European Royal Dutch Shell refineries on sale as part of the Anglo-Dutch oil group’s restructuring of its downstream operations.Essar – the conglomerate that spans mobile phones, steel, shipping and energy and is founded and controlled by Ravi and Shashi Ruia – is understood to be one of several potential buyers.Valero, the US refiner looking to expand in Europe and Libya, and an investment vehicle controlled by part of the Saudi royal family also have expressed interest.Essar is understood to be among the bidders for two German refineries as well as Shell’s Stanlow UK refinery at Ellesmere, in Cheshire.Stanlow is Shell’s only UK refinery, employs 1,000 people and 800 contractors and has a capacity of 272,000 barrels a day, producing about a sixth of the UK’s petrol.The disposals by Shell are part of its strategy to rid itself of smaller refineries in favour of investing in large, integrated complexes, such as those in Port Arthur, Texas and Rotterdam. The package is valued at about £1.5bn ($2.4bn).Refinery sales have been controversial because of the potential of large job losses.Indeed, UK refinery workers have in the past month threatened strike action over pay and other issues.In the hope of avoiding potential criticism, Shell said: “If a deal is pursued, the refinery would be sold as a going concern. If no deal is pursued, Stanlow will be retained in the Shell portfolio. There are no plans to close the refinery or associated local marketing businesses.”The two German refineries in Hamburg and Heide do not come with the same assurances. They have an aggregate capacity of about 200,000 b/d and each employs about 500 workers.Shell is also looking to sell its Montreal East refinery in Canada, which has a capacity of 121,000 b/d.Shell would not confirm the bid or interested parties. The company said on Monday: “The review of the refineries is still going on and will still take some time.”Lazard is running the auction for Shell. Results are expected to emerge in coming weeks.The sale of the refineries and some of the local wholesale distribution attached to them are part of Shell’s drive to cut costs, which has become doubly urgent as the recession has hit petroleum product demand and cut oil prices by more than half. But Shell is not getting out of refining as a whole.Last week, when Shell announced its $500m investment in a new hydrodesulphurisation plant at its Pernis refinery in the Netherlands, Tom Botts, its downstream executive vice-president, said: “The investment is part of Shell’s strategy of selective downstream growth and focus on larger, integrated refining and chemical sites.”
63;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2009-07-30T19:34:03Z;Sagging oil refineries;;"With oil prices being streamed live on bubblevision, it is easy to obsess on the hyperkinetic futures market and forget that the large, integrated companies dominating the industry also make plenty of money from refining and marketing the stuff. “ Crude” is much more than just benchmark WTI or Brent, and the gyrations of different varieties, along with a glut of refined products, have rained on the supermajors’ parade.ExxonMobil’s unpleasant earnings surprise on Thursday, for example, came from a two-thirds drop in refining earnings. The story was much the same at BP, Shell and especially ConocoPhillips, all of which suffered from a convergence in prices of low-quality heavy crude with lighter grades.Chevron signalled its results will be similarly hit, while pure refiners Valero and Tesoro both swung to losses in the last quarter. With Latin American and Middle Eastern producers paring heavy crude output, expensive refineries suited to handle it are sputtering. And, with demand falling amid plenty of new capacity in Asia, poor utilisation is sapping earnings.The problem may be secular, rather than cyclical, for refiners in the developed world. The coming years will be particularly tough for US refineries as a result of ebbing demand, competition from biofuels and new emissions rules. Consulting firm Deloitte compares the coming years to the collapse in US refinery profits in the early 1980s, which led to many closures. There were 319 US refineries in 1980 and 149 by 2006.Meanwhile, utilisation, which peaked at 90 per cent in 1977, fell below 70 per cent by 1981. More recently, utilisation peaked at 93 per cent in 2004 and Deloitte forecasts it will drop to 77 per cent by 2020.Refining, recently promoted to being a high-flying profit-centre, is back to being a drag.

64;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2009-07-28T20:40:06Z;Tech sector bright spot on Wall Street;;"Technology was a bright spot for US equities on Tuesday, while the broad market posted modest losses as consumer confidence fell for the second straight month.Earnings were mixed on Tuesday, and the reporting season remains in full swing.Later this week, companies including Dow Chemical, Exxon Mobil, Visa,
and Colgate-Palmolive will report their second-quarter results.After falling as much as 1.3 per cent, the S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 979.62. Equity volatility on the S&P rose, with the CBOE Vix index settling just under 25.Of the 10 major S&P industry sectors, technology was a rare standout, while utilities and energy dropped around 1.5 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite turned positive at mid-afternoon and closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,975.51 as tech continued to exert its leadership over the market.The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared early losses and settled 0.1 per cent lower at 9,096.72, as energy stocks weighed on blue chips.Ahead of earnings this week, Chevron slipped by 0.7 per cent to $68.34, while Exxon Mobil was down1.2 per cent at $71.89. The Dow was also hurt by American Express, which was lower by 2.5 per cent at $27.68 in the wake of a brokerage downgrade.In deal news, IBM, another member of the Dow, said it will buy SPSS, a provider of predictive analytics software, based in Chicago, for $50 a share, or $1.2bn.Shares in SPSS surged 41 per cent to $49.45, while IBM was lower by 0.3 per cent at $117.28.One bright spot for blue chips was General Electric, up 1.6 per cent at $12.52 as the conglomerate said its finance unit needs further capital.Further signs of a potential bottom in house prices helped homebuilders, with the S&P index up 0.1 per cent.In May, the S&P/Case-Shiller home price index posted its first month-over-month gain since its peak in July 2006.“A reversal in the direction of home prices, if sustained, will do a lot to help stabilise the banking system and re-liquefy the economy,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. “The broadening out in home price grains is perhaps the most important aspect of the report.”However, the Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence dropped more than forecast in July to 46.6, amid concerns over employment prospects.“The US consumer remains the weakest link in the very modest US upswing,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Securities.While the rally from the lows set in March remains intact, with the S&P 500 closing at a fresh eight- month high on Monday, some investors caution that the lowering of the bar for the second-quarter earnings season is an easy hurdle for companies to overcome.“Much of the improvement in profitability appears to be the result of expense-cutting via workforce reductions and inventory management, as opposed to top-line revenue growth,” said Wasif Latif, vice-president of equity investments at USAA Investment Management Company.“More than two-thirds of companies have reported sales declines,” he said. “To increase earnings on a sustainable basis, sales need to pick up.”Among earnings reports, Viacom recorded a drop of 32 per cent in second-quarter profits, as revenue fell 14 per cent to $3.3bn and missed a forecast of $3.5bn. The media conglomerate’s shares closed down 1.8 per cent at $25.15.Meanwhile, Office Depot was trading down 18 per cent at $4.38, after it reported a wider-than-forecast loss of $82m for the second quarter, and sales fell 22 per cent.Valero Energy reported a second-quarter loss, but it beat analysts’ estimates. The independent oil refiner saw its revenue tumble by 51 per cent for the quarter, which was not as bad as feared. That sparked a drop of 2.4 per cent to $18.32 in its shares.Shares in Textron jumped 18 per cent to $13.11. The maker of corporate jets recorded a second-quarter loss and cut its 2009 sales forecast, but beat estimates."
65;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2009-06-03T20:35:14Z;Wall Street dips on Bernanke warning;;Wall Street stocks declined on Wednesday as oil prices slid and investors reacted to mixed data on the economy and a warning from Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke.Testifying before the House Budget Committee, Mr Bernanke said the US budget deficit threatened US financial stability and said the government could not continue indefinitely to borrow at the current rate to finance the shortfall.“Unless we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability in the longer term, we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth. Maintaining the confidence of the financial markets requires that we, as a nation, begin planning now for the restoration of fiscal balance,” he said.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 index was down 1.4 per cent at 931.79, above its lows for the day, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.6 per cent lower at 1,825.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent lower at 8,676.20.Investors also reacted to several pieces of economic data. The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index edged up to 44 in May from 43.7 in April.Commerce Department data showed that an increase in demand for cars, electrical equipment and construction machinery helped boost US factory orders, which rose for the second time in three months.A report from payroll manager ADP showed a 532,000 drop in private sector jobs in the US in May. The figure was less than the 550,000 consensus among economists.The US Labor Department’s monthly report on employment is due on Friday.In corporate news, shares in insurer Aetna fell 4.7 per cent to $26 after it reduced its 2009 earnings forecast.Valero Energy, the largest US oil refiner, slumped 17.8 per cent after it said it expected to post a second- quarter loss and that it would sell stock. Shares in other oil companies fell as crude prices declined for a second day.Light, sweet crude for July delivery was down $1.95, or 2.8 per cent at $66.60 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Halliburton shares fell 4.6 per cent to $22.57, Sunoco was 7.5 per cent lower at $28.03 and Marathon Oil fell 7.2 per cent to $30.99. The S&P energy index was down 3.3 per cent.Toll Brothers fell 6.6 per cent to $18.24 after the homebuilder reported a narrower-than-expected loss on writedowns. Its losses saw the S&P homebuilders index fall 5 per cent to 214.81.Dish Network gave up 9.7 per cent to $15.56 after the second-largest US satellite-television provider and EchoStar were told to pay TiVo $192.7m in damages and interest because their software infringes TiVo’s patent, a US judge said. TiVo shares surged 53 per cent to $10.70.A federal court agreed late on Tuesday to hear a challenge by pension funds opposing the sale of Chrysler’s assets to Fiat.Arguments in the appeal will be held on Friday and could delay Chrysler’s emergence from bankruptcy.The Senate Commerce Committee is due to hold a hearing on the bankruptcies of Chrysler and General Motors on Thursday. GM will be dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average next week to be replaced by Cisco Systems. Cisco shares were down 1.3 per cent at $19.36.The financial sector remained in focus as stock market investors continued to respond to the latest round of equity capital raisings.The S&P financial index fell 1.5 per cent to 160.88. Shares in Citigroup, which will also be dropped from the Dow next week, to be replaced by Travelers, fell 3.4 per cent to $3.39. Travelers shares were 0.7 per cent lower at $42.70.Goldman Sachs was off 0.7 per cent at $142.15, Bank of Americafell 1.7 per cent to $11.21, while JPMorgan dropped 1.5 per cent to $33.98.Wednesday’s losses came after US stocks posted slight gains on Tuesday as investors digested the latest data on the housing market and a fresh round of bank capital raisings.Those gains took the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices to their closing highs for the year.
66;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Valero shuts refinery as slowdown bites;;Valero Energy said it would close an entire US refinery this quarter as it slashes petrol production and sharply reduces capital spending to manage the economic slowdown.The biggest US refiner has 15 refineries across the country. It said that in addition to shutting its large Texas City refinery, it would close the fluid catalytic cracking unit, which primarily produces petrol, at its Corpus Christi East Plant.Valero has cut the average useage rate at such petrol-producing units to 70-75 per cent capacity, down from the near full capacity at which the whole US system was running just a few years ago.“The sluggish economy is clearly a headwind against demand growth for refined products,’’ said Bill Klesse, Valero’s chairman and chief executive.Valero also cut its estimate for 2009 capital spending to $2.7bn from its previous estimate of $3.5bn. Analysts had been expecting more than $4bn in capital spending for 2009. The company said that the cut in planned expenditure would have an impact on discretionary projects at many of its refineries.Valero reported a fourth quarter net loss of $3.3bn, or $6.36 per share, on a goodwill impairment loss of $4.1bn.In the same quarter a year earlier, Valero had reported net income of $567m, or $1.02 per share. Excluding the impairment charge, related to various acquired assets, Valero reported fourth quarter 2008 net income of $732m, or $1.41 per share.Analysts expect Valero, with its diverse assets, to fare better than most US refiners in what is likely to be another difficult year. Last year, the sector suffered from a sharp drop in demand for petrol, as US consumers responded to the rise in petrol to more than $4 a gallon.The drop in demand meant refiners could not raise prices any further to pass along the continued rise in their crude oil feedstocks, which rose to just under $150 a barrel.And even though the price of crude oil has fallen this year – pushing the price of petrol back down with it to about $2 a gallon – refiners still face lacklustre demand amid the economic downturn.Analysts expect all the US refining sector to face another difficult year, with demand under pressure from the drastic slowdown in the economy.
67;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2009-01-09T21:48:07Z;Solar and biofuel projects score early 09 investments;;"In what promises to be a dismal year for cleantech investment, there are two early bright spots.Today SolFocus, a Silicon Valley company developing concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) technology, announced that it has raised $47m in series C financing. And earlier this week ZeaChem, a Colorado startup aiming to produce cellulosic ethanol, announced it raised $34m in series B financing.

For SolFocus, the cash will allow the company to deploy its first major commercial installations, in Greece and Spain. The round was led by Apex Capital with additional funding from New Enterprise Associates and NGEN Partners. By mid-February, SolFocus expects to close the round with a total of $60m to $70m in investment.Concentrator photovoltaic systems use an array of mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, highly efficient solar cells. There have been a handful of commercial CPV installations built in recent years, but SolFocus’ planned installation in Spain will be the largest in Europe, and possibly the largest in the world. With these and future installations, SolFocus expects to deliver 15 megawatts in 2009 and 85 megawatts in 2010.ZeaChem is developing a system that turns non-food (read, not corn) biomass into ethanol. Its new funds will go towards building the company’s first cellulosic biorefinery, which breaks ground this year. It will be a pilot plant, with the expectation that there could be commercial production by 2011.The ZeaChem round was co-led by Globespan Capital Partners and PrairieGold Venture Partners, with additional investment from two other VC firms and, notably, Valero Energy Corporation, the largest petroleum refiner in the US.Valero’s involvement suggests that while ZeaChem isn’t producing large quantities of ethanol right now, it is at least doing promising work on the refining front. The move also could signal a healthy bit of foresight for Valero – in a future without oil, the company is positioning itself to remain in the refinery business.These investments come despite preliminary results from The Cleantech Group that indicate in the fourth quarter of last year, cleantech venture investment was just $1.7bn, the smallest quarterly total in six quarters, and down 35 per cent from the previous quarter. A tighter capital market this year will almost certainly make it more difficult for cleantech companies to attract new investment going forward."
68;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2008-10-28T21:00:21Z;Wall St gains strongly despite grim data;;"US equities soared on Tuesday, rebounding from the heavy losses sustained in the previous two sessions as investors snapped up battered stocks in spite of a fresh glut of grim economic data.Throughout the session, swings in the S&P 500 were tightly correlated with moves in the exchange rates of the euro and dollar against the yen. That suggested widespread selling of yen positions had left traders with cash to invest in US stocks.After a wave of buying into the New York close, the S&P 500 finished up 10.8 per cent to 940.50. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 9.5 per cent to 1,649.47 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 10.9 per cent to 9,065.12.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, often referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 16.3 per cent, although at 66.99 continued to indicate heightened levels of distress.The market’s late afternoon surge came even after figures showed consumer confidence slumped to a record low in October, which Ian Shepherdson, of High Frequency Economics, described as “extraordinarily awful.” Separate data showed prices of single-family homes plunged by a record percentage in August.Energy and telecoms were two of the biggest sectoral winners. Exxon Mobil and AT&T were among the biggest blue-chip winners, up 13.3 per cent to $74.86 and 13.2 per cent to $27.61 respectively after analysts at Morgan Stanley highlighted their “defensive” qualities.Relatively well-received results from refiner Valero helped the energy sector. Its shares jumped 11.3 per cent to $16.81.Materials overall gained 12.7 per cent. US Steel’s third-quarter results were also positive and the shares jumped 14.2 per cent to $35.20 even after a downbeat assessment of prospects for the fourth quarter.The financial sector remained volatile, with large swings, particularly in the value of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Despite early losses, Morgan Stanley closed up 10.7 per cent at $15.20 and Goldman shares ended up 0.7 per cent at $93.57.Phil Orlando, strategist at Federated Investors, said sentiment was also helped by the continuing efforts by the US government to implement measures to help the financial sector. “There’s a recognition that these programmes will be successful [in the long term],” he said.Traders also took comfort from further signs of easing in money markets and the market is pricing in a 50 basis point interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday.Wal-Mart jumped 11.1 per cent to $55.17 after the world’s largest retailer told analysts it was “well-positioned” to deal with a global slump.In industrials, Boeing climbed 15.5 per cent to $48.91 on the prospect of a tentative deal to end a strike.General Motors advanced 14.7 per cent to $6.25 on reports that the hard-hit auto group was pushing for government aid to help a possible merger with
Chrysler.Meanwhile, internet stocks were in focus after Credit Suisse initiated coverage on several in the sector. “We are cautious on US display advertising,” the analysts wrote. “Investors should position their portfolios toward what we see as more sustainable growth in search and fixed-price e-commerce.”Google was up 11.9 per cent to $368.75 after Credit Suisse placed an “outperform” rating on the stock and a price target of $400.Airlines were a key winner, up 4.3 per cent overall. The sector was helped after Calyon upgraded a slew of stocks due to “dramatically falling oil prices and the deep capacity cuts implemented to support ticket prices and revenue, which sharply reduced variable and fixed costs”.Bucking the market’s upward momentum, Whirlpool lost 8.3 per cent to $45.87 after the group slashed its full-year outlook and said it would cut 5,000 jobs by the end of next year.Britannia Bulk Holdings plunged 85.8 per cent to 27 cents after the group said there was a “very high risk” that it would default on a $170m loan.Visa and MasterCard rose 7.3 per cent to $49.97 and 7.7 per cent to $136.01, respectively, after the duo agreed to pay $2.75bn to settle an antitrust lawsuit with
Discover Financial."
69;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2008-09-14T18:08:28Z;Texas rescue plea to hurricane evacuees;;"Federal emergency officials are urging Texans who fled their homes ahead of hurricane Ike to stay away, keeping roads passable for rescue workers and limiting additional burdens on shelter, food, petrol and water in heavily affected areas.Concerns remained on Sunday that the widespread destruction could put upward pressure on oil and petrol prices, given that 20 per cent of US oil and gas production and almost 20 per cent of the US oil refining capacity was shut before the storm, and it could take several days to weeks to restore production.However, the Department of Energy released 309,000 barrels of crude oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, calming worries about long-term supplies. Virtually all Gulf of Mexico production has been shut since hurricane Gustav went through the area on September 1.More than 1,000 people have been rescued since the category 2 storm swept into the region on Saturday, bringing winds faster than 100 miles per hour and a 13½-foot surge in the sea. Trees were knocked on to cars, homes and roads; branches punctured rooftops and crushed fences; traffic lights were ripped off; and skyscraper windows were blasted out, leaving glass, computers and furniture littering the centre. Most of Houston, the fourth most populated US city, remained without power on Sunday, and utilities said it could be weeks before electricity was fully restored.Valero, the biggest US refiner, said three of its Gulf coast refineries were without power. Though the refineries sustained limited damage and Valero was working with local utilities to restore power, Gulf coast pipelines that carry crude oil and refined products to other parts of the country were also suffering power outages, which will further complicate the supply situation.Rick Perry, the Texas governor, ordered the biggest search and rescue effort ever mounted in the state, using 7,500 national guardsmen.Five people had been reported dead so far, and more than 1,000 people had been rescued in Texas and Louisiana – mostly from flooded homes along the coast – where they had defied orders to evacuate. Flooding reached 10 feet in some places.“This hurricane has caused devastation across areas of Texas and Louisiana,’’ said David Paulison, administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “Along with our federal, state and local partners, Fema is working around the clock to get life-saving assistance into the hardest-hit areas.’’Yet there will be pressure from employers and schools on some residents to return; Rice University in Houston ordered its students back on Tuesday. The city ordered a 9pm to 6am curfew, fearing for residents’ safety on streets without lights and littered with debris. Monday’s game between the NFL’s Houston Texans and Baltimore Ravens was postponed.President George W. Bush said he would visit Texas on Tuesday to provide support to victims: “This is a tough storm, and it’s one that’s going to require time for people to recover.’’He is desperate to appear engaged following criticisms after the last big hurricane to hit a metropolitan area, hurricane Katrina in 2005, which devastated New Orleans amid charges the authorities failed to adequately prepare and rescue victims."
70;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2008-09-12T20:40:01Z;Wall Street rattled by Lehman uncertainty;;A highly voltaile week for Wall Street drew to a close with big-name financials continuing to weigh heavily on the market as investors awaited details of Lehman Brothers’ fate.Deepening uncertainty over the investment bank’s ability to raise capital and sell assets prompted concern over the prospects for other high profile institutions, including insurers, investment banks and thrifts.Stand-out stocks continued to endure heavy losses on Friday, which have dragged some to their lowest in more than a decade.American International Group tumbled another 30.8 per cent to $12.14 on Friday. Once the world’s largest insurer by market capitalisation, shares in AIG have lost more than 40 per cent this week.Merrill Lynch slid another 12.3 per cent to $17.05, taking its loss to a third of its value at the start of the week.Meanwhile, shares in Lehman itself fell 13.5 per cent, in part due to doubts over whether the US Treasury would fund a deal. Over the week, shares in the 158-year-old institution have slumped 77.5 per cent.Washington Mutual, which has sustained heavy losses in recent sessions, lost 3.5 per cent on Friday to $2.73 even after the lender said it would set aside less for bad loans in the third quarter. Over the week, it has lost 36 per cent.General Electric, one of the world’s largest insurers of debt, fell 5 per cent on Friday. MBIA, the monoline bond insurer, lost 5.1 per cent, taking its decline over the week to 21.8 per cent.Still, Zions Bancorporation offered at least some comfort to badly hit regional banks after successfully raising capital. The shares rose 11.5 per cent to $37.48 on Friday.The S&P 500 dipped in and out of negative territory throughout the day but had edged up 0.2 per cent at 1,251.70 by the close. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1 per cent at 2,261.27 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 11,421.99.Automotive stocks helped prop up the market on the prospect of low-interest government loans to help the sector. Over the week, General Motors and Ford climbed 21.5 per cent and 11.3 per cent to $13.01 and $4.91, respectively.Material, energy and utility stocks also gained on Friday on the back of rising commodity prices.In a memorable week, the benchmark S&P 500 finished only marginally in positive territory, up 0.1 per cent, even after the government in effect nationalised troubled mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Dow Jones stood 1.2 per cent higher, although the Nasdaq Composite 0.3 per cent lower.“Dour would be a fair word,” said Kevin Quinn, equity sales trader at Stanford Financial, of the mood on trading desks week.Over the course of the week, the market endured its biggest one-day fall of the year and was at one point on course to close at its lowest point of 2008. Yet stocks enjoyed boost later in the week as it emerged that Lehman was actively courting suitors.David Buik, analyst at BGC Partners, said: “Wall Street’s rally was all the more surprising to the degree that it seems unlikely that much of the world’s economies can drag itself up by the bootstraps.”Meanwhile, a slew of negative economic updates – capped on Friday with the release of worse-than-expected retail sales – served as a reminder that investor concerns are not confined to the financial sector.On Friday, retailer Macy was one of the biggest drags on the S&P 500, down 4.8 per cent to $20.81. Nordstrom and JC Penney each lost 4.1 per cent, to $34.07 and $41.43 respectively.Meanwhile, Best Buy fell 3.3 per cent to $44.49 after UBS downgraded the consumer electronics retailer from “buy” to “neutral” due in part to an excess supply of LCD televisions.Oil refiners enjoyed gains as Hurricane Ike headed towards Texas. Over the week, Valero Energy and Tesoro advanced 7.4 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.
71;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2008-09-11T21:02:25Z;Wall Street rallies in late session;;"Merrill Lynch fell to its lowest level in a decade on Thursday, one of several notable financial casualties in an otherwise bullish session for Wall Street stocks.In spite of continued concerns over Lehman Brothers – whose shares fell 41.8 per cent to $4.22 – the wider market rallied late in the day as heavy sell-offs were contained to a handful off stocks. By close, the financial sector had risen 1.5 per amid speculation that Bank of America was in talks to buy the embattled investment bank. Bank of America shares rose 2 per cent to $33.06.Concerns over some financial stocks were sparked by a further loss of confidence at Lehman as analysts raised doubts about its restructuring strategy. Several analysts, including those at Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank, cut their recommendations amid mounting worries that its credit rating could be cut.Merrill Lynch’s implied volatility – a measure of expected future movements over the next month – has reached a record, according to IVolatility.com. Its shares were off 16.6 per cent at $19.43Yet Washington Mutual – down as much as 24.6 per cent – rose 22 per cent at $2.83. In recent weeks, the shares have been pushed down by heavy shorting,. Reports also suggested that the US Office of Thrift Supervision was monitoring the condition of the company.Other financial stocks sustained large falls earlier in the day, only to rally later. American International Group stood 0.3 per cent higher at $2.83 by the close.However, Wachovia was the other main stand-out loser, down 5.3 per cent at $14.28.In volatile trading session, the benchmark S&P 500 index was at one point on course to close down at its lowest point this year before rallying before the close.By the close the S&P 500 closed up 1.4 per cent at 1,249.05 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.5 per cent at 11,433.71. The Nasdaq was 1.3 per cent higher at 2,258.22.That came even though confidence in Lehman Brothers appeared to evaporate. Citigroup wrote in a note to clients that “confidence and perception issues are overwhelming Lehman’s franchise value”.Investors were beginning to compartmentalise the risk of internal difficulties at certain institutions that face particular internal problems, said Walter Gerasimowicz, chief executive of Meditron Asset Management. “Just because the financials are getting hurt doesn’t mean there are not opportunities in other sectors.”Oil refiners were boosted as oil edged closer to the $100 mark.Leading the gains were Sunoco, Tesoro and Valero, up 12.4 per cent at $47.66, 9.3 per cent to $17.98 and 6.9 per cent to $33.03, respectively.The failing oil price boosted consumer discretionaries, which edged into
positive territory.Among the gains in the retail sector was Lululemon Athletica, which advanced 14.4 per cent to $18.94 on the back of well-received second-quarter results.Transport stocks also benefited. Among leaders, Continental Airlines rose 15.2 per cent to $18.51 after the carrier introduced plans to introduce a bag-check fee, which it expected to generate $100m in revenue.Also in transport, CSX rose 10.7 per cent to $60.70 after the third-largest US rail operator raised its 2008 profit forecast, citing a “positive outlook’’ for the industry.There were bright spots elsewhere. Allergan rose 10.9 per cent to $60.53 after the maker of Botox, the wrinkle-smoothing treatment, said clinical trials showed Botox was effective in treating chronic migraines.In technology, Microsoft put on 3.4 per cent to $27.34 after Research in Motion agreed to use Microsoft’s web search engine on its BlackBerry smartphones.Meanwhile, Altria Group’s purchase of UST took its toll on the rival tobacco company Reynolds American, which fell 3.8 per cent to $49.48.Earlier in the day, economic data weighed on investor confidence and served as a reminder that difficulties are not confined to the financial sector.Data pointed to a further weakening in the labour market, while a separate report showed a greater-than-expected widening in the US trade deficit, to its highest level since March 2007."
72;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2008-09-09T21:53:44Z;S&P 500 plunges in worst day this year;;American International Group led the fall-out from deepening uncertainty over Lehman Brothers’ ability to strengthen its balance sheet, amid fears it too could struggle to raise fresh capital if so required.The world’s biggest insurer, which has heavy exposure to the mortgage markets, suffered more than $12bn in writedowns and credit losses in the last quarter. The shares dropped 19.3 per cent to $18.37.The financial sector dragged the S&P 500 to its biggest loss for the year as concerns grew over asset sales ahead of banks’ third-quarter earnings season.Washington Mutual – also exposed to the mortgage market – sank 19.9 per cent to $3.30, a day after the bank was put under special regulatory supervision and ousted its chief executive. Excluding Lehman, it was the biggest laggard on the S&P 500.Wachovia, among the biggest gainers in the previous session, tumbled 14.5 per cent to $16.24 on Tuesday after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock from “neutral” to “underperform” and its price target from $18 to $16, due in part to expected higher credit losses.Goldman Sachs slid 4.8 per cent to $161.67 after analysts at Ladenburg Thalmann cut their profit forecast.Visa which along with Chinatrust Financial will replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the Dow Jones Financial Services Titans index, lost 3.7 per cent at $67.49.The wider market reversed Monday’s gains as initial relief faded over the government bail-out of the mortgage guarantors.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index – a measure of investor anxiety of future volatility – reached its highest level since the credit facility for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was announced and oil reached its peak in mid-July.By the close, the S&P 500 had fallen 3.4 per cent to 1,224.51, within sight of the closing low for the year hit in mid-July, led by an overall financial sector decline of 6.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.4 per cent to 11,230.73. The Nasdaq was 2.6 per cent lower at 2,209.81.A steeper-than-expected drop in pending home sales also weighed on sentiment, prompting growing worries of a worsening housing slump.The National Association of Realtors index of pending home resales fell 3.2 per cent in July after rising 5.8 per cent the previous month.Meanwhile, Credit Suisse downgraded four homebuilders – Toll Brothers, Pulte Homes, DR Horton and KB Home – from “outperform” to “neutral”. The shares fell 8.4 per cent to $24.26, 8.9 per cent to $14.77, 9.1 per cent to $12.83 and 9 per cent to $21.42, respectively.Another fall in oil prices hit the energy sector as US crude fell more than $3 a barrel after Opec’s meeting in Vienna.The declines were led by Massey Energy, Noble Energy, Valero Energy and National Oilwell Varco, which fell 19.4 per cent at $38.90, 12 per cent at $57.14, 11.8 per cent at $30.51 and 11.5 per cent at $52.92.Material companies also suffered, hit by wider commodity price declines. Nucor and US Steel dropped 9.7 per cent at $42.15, and 13 per cent at $93.69, respectively. AK Steel dropped 16.2 per cent to $33.72 after hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners, its largest shareholder, offloaded 3.1m shares.Amid the gloom, there was the odd bright spot. Oil’s continued retreat afforded at least some comfort to consumer stocks. Sears and Fortune Brands, for example, put on 0.9 per cent to $92.72 and 0.7 per cent to $61.65, respectively.McDonald’s rose 1.2 per cent at $63.19 after a positive August sales update from the fast-food chain.Hewlett-Packard edged up 0.6 per cent to $46.01 after Sanford C. Bernstein raised its recommendation on the world’s largest PC manufacturer from “market perform” to “outperform”.However, that failed to lift technology stocks more generally – which have been badly hit in recent sessions – into positive territory. Dell fell 4.3 per cent to $19.30 even after it emerged that founder Michael Dell bought $100m of stock in the computer manufacturer last week.Meanwhile, UAL, parent of United Airlines, continued to suffer losses after a false report surfaced on the internet on Tuesday that the carrier had returned to bankruptcy. Its shares fell 2.9 per cent to $10.60.
73;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2008-08-31T22:10:31Z;Oil supply disruption threatens prices;;Oil companies stepped up efforts to shut production in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday as hurricane Gustav tore into the US’s largest oil and natural gas producing region.Just over 96 per cent of oil production and 82 per cent of natural gas output in the Gulf were reported shut by officials on Sunday. That knocked out 1.21m barrels of capacity out of a total of 1.3m.Royal Dutch Shell said about 10 per cent of its stations were out of fuel as of Saturday morning in New Orleans, Baton Rouge and surrounding areas. It would continue delivering petrol to keep stations open as long as possible, but cautioned that its employees and operators would need to be evacuated.Valero, the biggest US refiner, said it had shut one Gulf coast refinery and was operating three others at reduced rates. It had closed 15 of the 30-40 petrol stations it operates in Louisiana because staff there had been evacuated. But it said it would continue supplying fuel to other stations along evacuation routes as long as possible.ExxonMobil and others also reported refinery shutdowns. The last big hurricanes to hit the Gulf coast, where 20 per cent of the US’s oil and gas is produced, were Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. More than 100 production platforms were destroyed in those storms, rigs were toppled and refineries flooded, so that, even a year later, 15 per cent of daily oil production in the Gulf and 11 per cent of daily gas production remained off line.The oil companies improved infrastructure on rebuilding, increasing anchoring and elevating control systems and other vital equipment after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Yet, three years later, production has not recovered to pre-Katrina levels. The Gulf produces 1.3m barrels per day of oil, down from 1.6m b/d then. Tight global demand for oil is likely to make any long-term loss of Gulf production worse this time round.“With both crude and total oil product inventories running significantly lower than they were when either [hurricanes] Katrina or Rita sidelined Gulf oil production [in 2005], both oil and gasoline prices are more exposed to potential storm-related supply disruptions,’’ said Jeff Rubin, chief economist at CIBC world markets, the Canadian investment bank.“A comparable hit to production could easily send gasoline prices to record highs, with pump prices rising to $5 per gallon.’’
74;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2008-08-18T20:36:32Z;Worries over financials drag Wall St down;;Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Monday as investors soured on financials, worrying about possible dilutive capital raising by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.The two mortgage giants were among the leading fallers, dropping to their lowest levels in nearly 20 years and dragging the financial sector down 3.6 per cent.Fannie and Freddie fell 22.3 per cent to $6.15 and 25 per cent to $4.39 respectively while investors sold their holdings in other financial institutions.Citigroup dropped 5 per cent to $17.62, JPMorgan slid 3.5 per cent to $36.74 and Bank of America gave up 4.6 per cent to $29.30.Rebecca Engmann Darst, an equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers. said: “The catalyst here is nothing new, simply a return of the Churchillian ‘Black Dog’ mood that has sat on the financial services industry and its long-suffering components for the better part of a year now.”Those losses came in spite of some takeover news. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the biggest bank in Japan, boosted its bid for the part of UnionBanCal it does not yet own by 17 per cent to $3.5bn. The offer values the entire company at about $10.1bn. UnionBanCal rose 11.7 per cent to $73.18.Energy stocks gave up early gains on news that the latest tropical storm will miss key production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Valero lost 4.7 per cent to $32.63 and Sunoco fell 8.9 per cent to $40.60 while the sector slipped 1.2 per cent.But the pullback in energy prices did little for consumer discretionary stocks. Carmaker General Motors fell 7.3 per cent to $10.36 while Amazon, the online retailer, lost 3.8 per cent to $83.11 and the sector dipped 1.8 per cent.Homebuilders came under strong selling pressure after a report showed their confidence remained at a record low in August.Lennar lost 7.3 per cent to $10.96, Centex dropped 7.6 per cent to $14.70 and an index of homebuilders slipped 6 per cent.There was some positive news for the consumer discretionary sector on Monday. Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, posted better- than-expected results and \edged up 0.4 per cent $24.59.Consumer staples were hit by some disappointing news from Hershey. The confectioner said higher prices due to rising commodity costs would probably curtail demand for its chocolates and sales growth could slow 2-3 per cent next year.Hershey fell 9.4 per cent to $37.71 while Kroger and SuperValu lost 5.1 per cent to $28.51 and 2.8 per cent to $27.12 respectively. The sector gave up 1 per cent.Nine of the 10 leading industry groups closed in the red, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down 1.5 per cent to 1,278.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6 per cent to 11,479.39 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.5 per cent to 2,416.98.Wall Street stocks made modest gains for a third week in a row last week after oil prices eased.The benchmark S&P 500 index has rallied about 6 per cent from its July lows as oil and other key commodity prices have eased back from their highs.Ian Scott, a global equities strategist at Lehman Brothers, said: “This latest market recovery has been a very muted one . . . Cash levels remain high and largely unmoved, so the rally, such as it is, appears to have been driven by short covering.”In other corporate news, Broadcom, the chipmaker, made ground after Barrons’ said that the shares could gain as much as 40 per cent on demand for its iPhone components.Shares in Broadcom rose 1.6 per cent to $27.90 but those gains barely dented a 1.6 per cent loss for the sector.Consumer facing tech stocks were among the leading fallers with Google dipping 2.3 per cent to $498.30, Hewlett-Packard losing 2.2 per cent to $44.60 and IBM giving up 1.4 per cent to $124.59.Telecom stocks dropped back 1 per cent on Monday in spite of some positive analyst comments.The sector has struggled so far this year. However, Brian Belski, US sector strategist at Merrill Lynch, said: “Personal consumption and pricing trends are beginning to provide a positive backdrop for the sector . . . and are likely to add support in the coming months.”AT&T fell 0.8 per cent to $31.40 while Qwest Communications International lost 2.3 per cent to $3.83.
75;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2008-08-06T20:38:46Z;Gains in energy and materials lift Wall Street;;US stocks climbed modestly on Wednesday for a second straight session as energy and materials stocks made ground and investors cheered some decent results from technology bellwether Cisco.A small pull back in oil prices and a drop in gasoline inventories helped refiners to advance, taking energy stocks to a 1.9 per cent gain.Sunoco, Tesoro and Valero added 3.3 per cent to $43.28, 12 per cent to $17.39 and 7.3 per cent to $34.47 respectively.Materials stocks were the day’s second biggest gainers, climbing 1.6 per cent on some analyst upgrades and a bump in certain commodity prices.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold was the outstanding performer, adding 11 per cent to $87.67.Citigroup analyst John Hill advised clients to buy the shares, noting that they had dropped more than 35 per cent since mid-June while the company still had exposure to China, high margins and strong free cash flow.Technology was another positive. Cisco climbed 5.7 per cent to $23.93 after posting estimate-beating fourth quarter profits.Microsoft also received a boost after an analyst at UBS said the company could buy up to $20bn of stock back over the next three months. The shares rose 3.1 per cent to $27.02 while the broader sector added 1.3 per cent.The benchmark S&P 500 index shrugged off early losses to close 0.3 per cent higher at 1,289.07 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 11,656.07. The Nasdaq Composite ended the day 1.2 per cent ahead at 2,378.37.On Tuesday stocks rose the most in four months after oil prices dropped sharply and the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate at 2 per cent. An accompanying statement seemed to reduce the likelihood of rate rises, soothing investors concerns.In the telecoms sector, disappointing earnings news dragged the sector down 1.4 per cent on Wednesday.Sprint Nextel posted a $344m second quarter loss due to spending on discounts and advertising to win new customers. Sales fell 11 per cent to $9.06bn and the shares dived 14.2 per cent to $7.34. Qwest Communications International said profit dropped 24 per cent to $188m and cut its annual forecast. The results were in line with estimates but the shares slipped 6 per cent to $3.45.So far this earnings season more than 400 of the S&P 500 companies have reported results and on average, index members have seen an 18 per cent drop in profits.Financials have had another torrid quarter. Melissa Roberts, an analyst at KBW, said: “Results continued to be disappointing across capitalisation levels [revealing] continued asset quality deterioration, revenue growth offset by mounting expense growth, and reduced profitability.”KBW cut its earnings estimates for 2008 and 2009 by 14 per cent and 10 per cent respectively as a result.On Wednesday, there was mixed news from the embattled sector. Freddie Mac shares plunged 19.3 per cent to $6.49 after the mortgage finance company posted its fourth loss in a row and said it would cut its dividend.Fannie Mae, another government-sponsored entity, slumped 14.7 per cent to $11.60 on the news. Fannie reports results on Friday. Elsewhere in the financials sector the news was mixed but the sector was among the biggest losers of the morning session, dropping 0.7 per cent.Marsh & McLennan, said second-quarter profit fell 63 per cent to $65m owing to higher staff costs and certain writedowns at its corporate security division. The insurance broker still beat analysts’ estimates and the shares rose 2.5 per cent to $30.07. Nasdaq OMX Group jumped 16.9 per cent to $30.89 after the exchange operator posted results that beat analysts’ quarterly estimates.In the consumer staples sector, a drop in agricultural commodity prices helped offset a handful of disappointing results.Whole Foods, the grocer, tumbled 12.6 per cent to $20.04 after it posted annual earnings that undershot analyst’s estimates.Dean Foods dropped 5.7 per cent to $22.02 after the maker of dairy products forecast lower third-quarter profits than expected. As a whole, the consumer staples sector rose 1.1 per cent.Profit-taking and some poor results took their toll on the consumer-discretionary sector however. It lost 0.5 per cent led down by a 7.2 per cent fall to $22.45 for restaurant chain operator Wendy’s International.
76;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2008-05-09T18:14:35Z;Valero deal hints at room for takeovers;;Valero Energy’s deal this week to sell a Louisiana refinery at a lukewarm price highlights the refining industry’s margin troubles, but it also signals that financing may be more readily available for deals in the booming energy and commodities sector than for takeovers within other segments of the economy.Alon, a subsidiary of Alon Israel Oil, has agreed to pay $333m for one of a handful of crude oil refineries Valero has put on the auction block.Valero, one of the world’s largest oil refiners, sold the facility at a discount of at least 15 per cent of the valuation that it achieved from the sale of its larger Ohio refinery last year.The valuation is calculated as a unit price based on a refinery’s capacity and type of products it handles.Valero and rival Sunoco both announced plans to sell refining assets last year, at a time when rising crude oil input costs had already put their profits under pressure.A spike in crude prices since then has further crushed the notoriously cyclical business’ margins, and analysts expect refining assets’ sale prices to suffer accordingly.Alon won a $245m term loan from Credit Suisse to finance the acquisition. It also secured a $425m revolving credit facility from Wachovia, which can be expanded to $500m, and secured a $50m letter of credit to allow for hedging activity.The company said it would quickly pay down some of that debt.With acquisition financing scarce, the arrangement suggests that dealmaking within the energy and commodities sectors could accelerate this year, according to people within the industries.Uncertainty over commodity prices has infused the market with a level of caution over big deals. But a variety of assets are on the market in small and mid-sized bites that could be easier for buyers and lenders to swallow.Parts of Hunt Petroleum, a privately-owned exploration and production company, and potentially the entire company, remain up for sale, according to people familiar with the process.Corporate buyers and sellers are expected to account for most of the deals. But buy-out investors are also prowling for ways to take advantage of the pricing boom.The Blackstone Group recently teamed up with First Reserve, the energy-focused private equity firm, and Thomas O’Malley, the former chairman of a refiner in which Blackstone once invested, to pursue oil refining buy-outs. The partners have contributed a total of $2bn in equity to that venture.Other private equity firms, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, have looked closely at energy assets in recent months, according to people within the industry.In one of the year’s larger energy-related buy-outs, First Reserve agreed in February to pay $1.5bn for CHC Helicopter, which provides offshore helicopter services. Morgan Stanley agreed to finance that deal.
77;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2008-04-24T20:11:37Z;US petrol price at historic low;;"Despite having reached an all-time high, US petrol prices are at a historical low in relation to crude oil prices, according to a study by a prominent think-tank at Rice University in Texas. Given stagnant or even falling demand at the pump, refiners are finding it difficult to pass oil price increases on to consumers.Jim Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, the third biggest US oil and gas company and second biggest US refiner, said in an interview with the Financial Times refiners were only “breaking even” despite the outcry over rising petrol prices.The university study reveals that if the price of petrol followed that of crude oil, petrol should have risen to $3.68 a gallon once oil hit $100 a barrel, based on the historical price relationship.Given that crude oil costs usually make up about
60 per cent of fuel prices, there has always been a close correlation between petrol and oil prices. Yet despite oil having risen as high as $119 in recent days, average US petrol prices have remained below $3.68.As a result, margins of refiners have decreased and the cost of crude oil now accounts for 65 to 70 per cent of the price at the pump.The US’s biggest refiner, Valero, has pre-announced first-quarter earnings of between 10 and 35 cents per share, a sharp drop from Credit Suisse Global Energy’s $1.14 estimate.Integrated oil companies, conducting exploration and production as well as refining and marketing, are better shielded from the inability to raise petrol prices further. ConocoPhillips reported a first-quarter net income of $4.1bn (€2.6bn, £2.1bn) yesterday, but only $520m in net income for its refining and marketing segment, down from $1.1bn in the first quarter of 2007.In addition to sagging petrol demand, Credit Suisse’s US equity research team says refinery margins are also under pressure because of the introduction of ethanol into the US market.If petrol prices continue to rise, analysts expect demand to fall further, leaving refiners with oversupply. According to Mr Mulva, some refiners have already stopped “some runs” because they judge the market to have excess supply.Amy Myers Jaffe, energy expert at the Baker Institute, says that in the past couple of years rising prices have begun to have an impact on US demand, resulting in the average annual consumption increase falling sharply from the previous decade. From 2003 to 2004, US petrol consumption rose 1.9 per cent, but increased only 0.6 per cent from 2004 to 2005 and
1 per cent from 2005 to 2006. Preliminary data for 2007 indicate demand rose 0.5 per cent from 2006 to 2007.This month, oil companies were called to hearings in Congress to explain the record price rises.
● Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, yesterday called on the White House to temporarily stop sending crude oil to the nation’s emergency stockpile, Reuters reports from Washington.The White House has resisted calls to stop deliveries to the reserve, saying they have a minimal effect on prices and are a necessary buffer against supply disruptions. Ms Pelosi said suspending deliveries would cut pump prices by five to 24 cents per gallon."
78;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2008-04-24T16:14:24Z;ConocoPhillips suffers low refining margins;;ConocoPhillips, the US’ third largest oil and gas company, said its first-quarter results were hit by lower margins in its refining and marketing segment, as petrol prices failed to keep pace with rising crude oil prices.Despite a better-than-expected overall financial result, of $4.1bn, or $2.62 per share, up from $3.6bn, or $2.12 per share, for the year-earlier quarter, the company’s refining segment suffered the effect of US petrol prices well below expectations, in addition to lower volumes on operational problems, unplanned downtime and asset dispositions.Conoco’s refining and marketing segment reported net income of $520m, down from $1.1bn in the year-earlier quarter.Even as the price of crude oil, which comprises 60 per cent of the price of petrol at the pump, continued to rise, petrol prices did not keep pace in the US, where Conoco is the second biggest refiner, given already flat-to-dropping demand for petrol on above average crude oil prices and a slowing economy.Nonethelesss, Credit Suisse Global Energy, said Conoco’s above average exposure to diesel is likely to have helped, given the relative strength of diesel to gasoline in the period. The research group called the results “a credible performance in one of the worst quarters of recent years”.Valero, the US’ biggest refiner, is expected to register the impact of falling petrol margins when it reports on Tuesday, as are ExxonMobil and Chevron, which will report at the end of next week.Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chief executive, said that while margins should improve in the second quarter, he expects “continued negative pressure from crude costs”.The company’s exploration and production segment provided net income of $2.9bn, up from $2.3bn in the year-earlier quarter on the rising oil prices. Analysts aid that included a better contribution than expected from its Lukoil investments, which are “difficult to model”. Conoco’s 20 per cent holding in that Russian oil and gas group yielded net income of $710m, up from $256m in the year-earlier quarter.He pledged to share repurchases of between $2bn to $3bn for the second quarter, which is in line with Conoco’s plans to spend $10bn on share buybacks this year.The oil majors have been committing billions of dollars toward share buybacks in recent years, as investment opportunities have grown increasingly constrained by nationalism in oil-rich nations limiting their prospects. The shortage of talent and supplies in the energy industry, ramping up to take advantage of high oil prices and the move into alternative energy, has also contributed to investment constraints.
79;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2008-04-23T19:44:29Z;US oil refiners;;Petrol is topping $4 a gallon, but US refining stocks look cheap. At 8 times 2008 earnings, the sector trades close to historic trough levels. The reason? Even though the price of refined products such as petrol has risen, the cost of crude oil has surged even faster, squeezing refiners’ margins.Refining bulls look for a rebound in margins, citing the recent sharp falls in gasoline inventories. At best, though, any bounce looks short-lived. The broader picture is one of economic weakness and inventories that remain above the seasonal norm. The recent decline is due less to an increase in demand and more to cuts in capacity utilisation. Meanwhile, state-subsidised ethanol is displacing petrol demand at the margin. On the input side, non-domestic factors such as rising Chinese demand help to keep crude expensive.Beyond 2008, there is a further threat to the sector in the shape of new refineries. Refining’s recent renaissance stemmed from global demand finally catching up with surplus capacity. Lehman Brothers, however, estimates basic capacity will expand by about 9m barrels a day over the next three years – roughly three times the growth in demand.One comforting factor is that most of those plants will be built in Asia. Since it remains very difficult to site new refineries in North America, existing assets enjoy a scarcity premium. Petrobras of Brazil, for example, has expressed interest in Valero Energy’s plant on the Caribbean island of Aruba. Blackstone is also on the prowl for refineries. Even Kirk Kerkorian, whose $64-a- share offer for 16 per cent of Tesoro Petroleum failed last year, might be tempted back in now that the stock trades at about $28. Banking on merger activity to lift a sector is risky. But with few other catalysts out there, it may be investors’ best hope for a sustainable rally.Post and read comments on this Lex
80;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Valero looks overseas;;The golden age is over. Valero Energy rode an incredible wave over the past few years. Last summer, its shares hit about $78 – an almost eight-fold increase since 2003.Now, with its stock at $51, North America’s largest oil refiner is considering selling about a quarter of its 3.1m barrels per day of capacity. Some of the proceeds could be invested overseas. Refining was long the least profitable part of the oil business, a result of excess capacity built in the 1970s. As rising demand tightened the market, so refining margins rose, expanding from less than $5 a barrel at the start of the decade to more than $30 in May 2007.Domestic conditions are pretty toxic for US refiners right now. High energy prices are having an impact: factor in increasing quantities of ethanol in the fuel mix and US demand for petroleum-based gasoline actually fell last year. Meanwhile, rate cuts are tempting more dollars into crude oil speculation, forcing up the cost of refiners’ main raw material. With $4-a-gallon gasoline in sight, political pressure on the industry is rising: the majors are to be hauled up in front of Congress, again, in April.The US is still the world’s largest fuel market and a difficult place to build new plants. That means there are buyers for assets. Private equity groups Blackstone and First Reserve recently established a joint venture with Petroplus to acquire refineries. Valero is upgrading some of its other US plants.Still, Asia and the Middle East are now the centres of oil demand growth, helped by government subsidies that encourage consumption. And refiners, which just process rather than own crude in the ground, are less likely than their upstream cousins to run into resource nationalism. Valero, built through a series of well-timed acquisitions, may be signalling the way forward once again.
81;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2007-11-23T02:14:46Z;No end in sight for refiners’ ‘hell scenario’;;For the past few years, everyone from ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest publicly listed oil company, to Valero, the leading refiner in the US, has enjoyed burgeoning profits on the back of record oil prices.But in the third quarter of this year, that trend began to reverse. High oil prices are now turning against these companies.“Today’s environment has the attributes of our refiners’ hell scenario,” says John Paisie, head of US downstream consulting at PFC Energy.Oil prices rose almost $30 in the third quarter, he said, while gasoline prices rem­ained flat. “Margins really have been squeezed from the highs seen earlier this year.’’Refiners have found that pump prices could not keep pace with oil prices, which were no longer being driven up by market fundamentals but by geopolitics. Inventor­ies were high, leaving refiners loathe to pass on the high cost of feedstocks to customers, lest demand drop off – leaving them stuck with supplies for which they had paid top dollar.These factors were a major contributor to the 26 per cent decline in Chevron’s third quarter net income to $3.7bn, from the same period last year. Exxon reported a 10 per cent decline from the year-earlier quarter to $9.4bn, or $1.70 per share.Valero, the US’s biggest refiner, confirmed the trend with net income of $1.3bn, down from $1.6bn year-on-year, coupled with the announcement of the sale of one of its refineries.Doug Leggate of Citi Investment Research does not see doom and gloom in the numbers, however.“I don’t think this is terminal,’’ he says. He recommends investors keep an eye on the sector: “This is starting to look like an attractive entry point for refiners.’’But the consensus is that results might worsen as the year comes to a close.Bill Klesse, chairman and chief executive of Valero, said: “So far in the fourth quarter, the margin environment has been difficult as prices for refined product have failed to keep pace with the increase in feedstock costs.”The world’s biggest oil companies and refiners have been taken aback, explains Rodolfo Guzman, director at Arthur D. Little, the consultancy, because people have referred to the past four or five years as the “golden age of refining’’.Refiners did not expect margins would decline be­cause supply and demand are so tightly balanced. The last round of consolidation in the sector had disposed of many of the smaller players, creating a sentiment that the leading companies could prevent the kind of overcapacity that led to weak refining margins in the past.While there is some new capacity to come online from 2008 to 2010, which would have weakened margins, no companies expected the rapid run-up in oil prices – caused by geopolitical concerns in the Middle East and Opec’s tight control of output.Given that oil prices are already racing up in the fourth quarter, analysts cannot do much more than speculate about what will happen to refining margins.If its price continues rising, analysts suspect refiners will have no choice but to raise petrol prices to recover mounting losses. In addition, the squeeze on margins will limit further growth in refining capacity until oil prices come down. But with prices hitting $100 a barrel, nobody can accurately predict when “the refiners’ hell scenario” will end.
82;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2007-11-06T21:49:24Z;Wall St rebounds amid record oil and gold;;Wall Street shares rebounded on Tuesday as commodity prices hit new highs, providing a boon to energy and materials stocks.Financial stocks recovered some of their recent heavy losses amid lingering concerns about banks’ exposure to credit and mortgage market losses. However some mixed corporate earnings continued to weigh on sentiment.Writedowns from financial companies and disappointing results from energy groups have caused estimates of earnings growth on an annual basis for S&P 500 companies to slip to 6.9 per cent in the fourth quarter from 11.9 per cent, according to Thomson Financial.Blended earnings, including actual and estimated results, for the S&P 500 are down 1.7 per cent for the third quarter, the first drop since 2002.A late rally helped the S&P 500 close 1.2 per cent higher at 1,520.27 points,. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.1 per cent at 2,825.18 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9 per cent to 13,660.94.Energy stocks had the best of the gains after crude oil futures hit $97 a barrel for the first time. The S&P energy index rose 2.7 per cent at 589.04. ExxonMobil gained 3.1 per cent at $90.38 and Chevron rose 2.4 per cent at $90.64. Hess rose 7 per cent at $73.98.Valero Energy, the US’s biggest oil refiner, rose 4.8 per cent to $72.73 in spite of posting a 21 per cent decline in third-quarter profits after gasoline margins fell sharply.Materials stocks rose as precious metals, including gold, silver and platinum, reached fresh heights. The S&P materials index gained 2.5 per cent at 268.17. Alcoa rose 1.8 per cent at $38.57 while Newmont Mining rose 4.1 per cent at $54.50.Financial stocks hit back as investors tentatively put aside worries about potential credit market losses. Citigroup’s disclosure this week that it would make up to $11bn in further mortgage-related writedowns sparked concern that other banks and financial institutions will follow suit.Rumours that banks will have to writedown “level 3 assets” – assets that are so illiquid they are difficult to value – continued to unsettle the market. Goldman Sachs rose 2.2 per cent at $223.16 after it said persistent rumours that it would make mortgage-related writedowns were “still untrue”.Bear Stearns gained 2.1 per cent at $102 and Merrill Lynch rose 0.9 per cent at $56.37. But Citigroup fell 2.3 per cent at $35.08 while Morgan Stanley shed 1.9 per cent at $54.51.The S&P financial index gained 1.7 per cent at 425.46, helped by MasterCard, which soared 7.2 per cent at $199.40 after Deutsche Bank raised its rating to “buy” and set a $250 target.Christopher Flanagan, JPMorgan analyst, said total losses stemming from mortgage linked securities could reach $200bn, against only $30bn-$40bn in losses reported so far.“Banks, brokers, mortgage and monoline insurers will bear the brunt of this loss recognition,” he said. But credit insurers, which have suffered some of the worst share price falls, rallied.Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, gained 13.8 per cent at $27.99 after it disputed a Morgan Stanley report that the industry’s losses would worsen.Ambac said Morgan’s estimates “do not accurately reflect the composition of our underlying mortgage portfolio and the structure of our deals”. MBIA, another bond insurer, gained 7.3 per cent at $35.65.Among homebuilders Hovnanian Enterprises fell 0.7 per cent at $10.04 after home deliveries fell 19 per cent in the fourth quarter, while cancellations reached 40 per cent. Beazer Homes suspended its dividend, cut 25 per cent of its staff and took $230m in pre-tax charges. Shares rose 10 per cent at $10.47 after an adviser to union pension funds called for the board to oust Ian McCarthy, chief executive.In technology, Sun Microsystems fell 9.6 per cent to $5.16 after revenues missed analysts’ expectations. Google gained 2.2 per cent at $741.79 after Sanford C Bernstein raised its price target to $850. Microsoft fell 0.9 per cent at $36.41 after it was dropped from a Goldman Sachs buy list.Alibaba.com, the Chinese e-commerce portal, almost tripled in price on its Hong Kong debut.But Yahoo, a 39 per cent stakeholder in Alibaba’s parent, fell 4.6 per cent to $29.93.
83;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2007-10-10T20:42:16Z;Dow, S&P 500 down as earnings disappoint;;Wall Street stocks were mixed yesterday as investors were jolted by a string of disappointing company earnings announcements.But stocks proved relatively resilient in spite of indications that third-quarter corporate earnings could decline.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.6 per cent lower at 14,078.69, having fallen as much as 1.1 per cent. The S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent at 1,562.47 but the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent higher at 2,811.61.Large-cap companies with a high proportion of international sales attracted buyers as concerns mounted about the health of US corporate profits.Procter & Gamble, up 0.5 per cent at $71.40, Microsoft, 0.4 per cent firmer at $30.23, and IBM, 0.3 per cent higher at $118.62, were among the Dow’s best performers.But Boeing weighed on the index, falling 2.8 per cent to $98.68 after it announced a six-month delay to deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner aircraft.The defensive mood saw transport and consumer discretionary stocks sold down while consumer staples gained.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Vix index climbed 3.4 per cent to 16.67.Alcoa kicked off the third-quarter earnings season late on Tuesday, reporting a 3 per cent rise in its third-quarter earnings but missing analysts’ expectations. The group also said it planned to boost its share buyback programme to 25 per cent from 10 per cent of its outstanding common stock.Standard & Poor’s cut its 2007 earnings estimate on the stock, citing the third-quarter shortfall and concerns about a weak fourth quarter. The shares declined 2.5 per cent to $38.73.Costco, the wholesale retailer, cheered investors with a 5 per cent rise in its fiscal fourth-quarter profit, a result that matched estimates. Its shares climbed 9.2 per cent to $69.13. But PetSmart fell 4.1 per cent to $31.06 after it lowered its third-quarter and full-year earnings estimates.Energy stocks recovered later in the session, in spite of profit warnings from Chevron and Valero Energy.Chevron’s shares fell 0.8 per cent to $92.08 after it warned late on Tuesday that third-quarter earnings would be “significantly below” the last quarter because of declining refining margins. Valero cut its third-quarter earnings estimate but closed 2.9 per cent higher at $74.25.International Paper, down 2.4 per cent at $36.18, also warned that third-quarter earnings would miss expectations.The series of profit warnings and lower-than- expected actual results drove the third-quarter outlook for the S&P 500 perilously close to negative territory yesterday. S&P 500 company earnings are forecast to expand at an average 0.1 per cent annual rate for the quarter according to Thomson Financial. This is down from an estimate of about 4 per cent just over a week ago.The last quarter of negative S&P earnings occurred in the first three months of 2002, when profits declined 11.5 per cent.Since July 1, estimates of third-quarter earnings have been lowered from 6.2 per cent.Financials are one of two major sectors that have experienced the largest downgrades. Average earnings for financials are seen as falling 8 per cent, while consumer discretionary stocks are forecast to see earnings slide 7 per cent. Energy earnings are forecast to decline 4 per cent.Healthcare, up 12 per cent and technology, up 10 per cent have the highest forecast earnings growth for the third quarter said Thomson.Interest rate futures price in about a 30 per cent chance that the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee will lower rates when it meets at the end of the month. A cut in the 4.75 per cent Fed funds rate to 4.5 per cent is still priced in by year end.Automakers were in focus yesterday after the United Auto Workers began strike action at Chrysler. Workers at General Motors, down 0.5 per cent at $38.13, are voting on their own tentative contract agreement after a two-day strike last month.Ford, 1 per cent lower at $8.23, must also hold talks with the UAW.In the technology sector, VMware gained 5.3 per cent to $107.04 after UBS raised its price target from $92 to $120. Cisco again hit a high for the year, up 0.6 per cent at $33.27. Google closed up 1.7 per cent at a new high of $625.39.
84;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2007-08-02T18:26:24Z;Oil sector rotation;;Investors in oil stocks, perhaps worried about contagion, should also be wary of inflection. The oil forward curve has flipped over, with spot crude now commanding a premium to longer-dated contracts, having traded at a discount for the past couple of years. What does that change mean in terms of which stocks to own?In theory, exploration and production companies should benefit from the tighter market that the new curve suggests. On Wednesday, the US reported a big fall in crude inventories. That did not stop the oil price from falling, however. The fact is inventories are still above their five-year range, so further falls will not necessarily support prices. Indeed, Bernstein Research points out that since 2004 – as more speculative money entered the oil market – crude prices have tended to follow inventories downwards.One alternative subsector, pure refiners, is also suffering. Companies such as Valero have enjoyed Google-esque share price performance since 2004 as rising demand for fuels finally squeezed out the industry’s excess capacity. Heavy maintenance schedules in the US, keeping refineries switched off, provided a last hurrah in the first half of 2007. But the latest fall in crude inventories came alongside inventory increases for most refined products. With more refineries back online, refining margins have duly fallen sharply.Inflection points usually portend volatility. That is amplified by the general panic gripping the markets. In that environment, oil aficionados might consider turning defensive and buying some laggards of recent years: the bigger integrated majors. BP offers some scope for gains from a recovery angle although its heavy weighting to the upstream business leaves it relatively more sensitive to oil prices. Royal Dutch Shell is cheaper, trading on about 10 times 2007 earnings, and offers a more balanced portfolio. ExxonMobil, at 12.5 times, is on a premium. On the other hand, Exxon is the bluest of blue chips, with net cash and share repurchases of $7bn a quarter. In an ailing equities market, that is strong medicine.
85;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2007-07-31T20:12:46Z;Crude surges as risk appetite returns;;Commodities prices yesterday rose across the board, with strong oil and base metal gains, on a recovery of risk appetite thanks to calmer credit markets.Oil prices yesterday surged above $78 a barrel, approaching last year’s all-time highs on fears that demand would increase in the second half of the year and lagging supply.Tokyo Electric Power Company, the operator of the earthquake-hit Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant, said yesterday it would double its oil purchases to fuel spare power plants and compensate for the loss of nuclear electricity. Tepco, Asia’s biggest utility, will now buy about 180,000 barrels a day. Japan is the world’s second-largest oil importer.ICE September Brent in late trading rose $1.31 to $77.05 a barrel, while Nymex September West Texas Intermediate surged $1.38 to $78.21 a barrel. US oil prices are at their highest level since hitting a record of $78.40 a year ago.WTI crude oil moved above Brent last week on tight inventories in Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point of the Nymex crude oil contract. Crude stocks there have dropped for the last nine weeks.Nymex September RBOB gasoline rose 6.5 cents to $2.1507 a gallon while Nymex September heating oil rose 3.77 cents to $2.1028 a gallon.Valero, the largest US refiner, said it was expecting larger than normal refinery overhauls in 2009 and 2010, suggesting the problems of the US refinery systems are not over.Crude oil prices had been underpinned by a large number of refinery accidents and maintenance work, which cut petrol and heating oil production during the spring and summer.The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has blamed the US refinery problems for the high oil prices. The oil cartel, which controls about 40 per cent of the world’s oil production, had rejected calls for an increase in supply ahead of its ministerial meeting in Vienna in September.Traders were also watching an area of low pressure in the Atlantic in anticipation of hurricanes heading to the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico. However, Daniel Guertin of Lehman Brothers said “prospects for development were very limited”.Underlying fundamentals for the commodities market looked strong, with the Baltic Dry index, the best gauge of bulk shipping costs, yesterday rising to an all-time high of 6,967 points, up 0.45 per cent on the day. The index has hit six consecutive records on robust commodities demand and port congestion.Base metals rose across the board, with the only exception being aluminium, which in late London trade dropped 1.01 per cent to $2,747 a tonne. Copper rallied above $8,000 a tonne and was trading 1.7 per cent higher at $8,003.50 a tonne.Lead surged to $3,125 a tonne and later traded up 6.4 per cent to $3,100 a tonne. In spite of the price rise, lead is below its recent all-time high of $3,500 a tonne. Tin hit an all-time high of $16,600 a tonne and nickel rebounded 2.5 per cent to $31,250 a tonne, having earlier rose to $32,000 a tonne.Wheat prices corrected from a recent 11-year high, but were supported by concerns over the crop. CBOT September wheat moved 1½ cents lower to $6.35 a bushel. Corn advanced 2 cents to $3.25 a bushel.
86;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2007-05-25T16:59:10Z;Nick Louth: I’m not looking so stupid after all;;Stupidity and brilliance are not always a state of mind but quite often a state of market prices. In this column in December I described how I had in the previous two years hedged my portfolio against the risk of higher oil prices by filling it with various types of oil companies.The idea was that if further squeezes on the supply of oil materialised, the price rises in my oil sector picks would mitigate the price falls caused in the more general universe of shares that I held.These companies, bought throughout 2005 and 2006, included explorers Sterling Energy and Roc, gas explorer BG, mid-size US production firm Apache and specialist US refiner Valero. Though I have tweaked these holdings, having disposed of gas explorer BG, I still largely have my holdings intact, and they currently account for around 12 per cent of my portfolio.The trouble with taking such a long-term hedge against a volatile price as that of oil is that at times you look brilliant and far-sighted and at other times you look, well, stupid.I was going through a ”stupid” patch when I last wrote about this subject in December when crude prices were languishing at around $50 a barrel. I can now report that I am feeling the tingle of “brilliance” beginning to course through my veins, as prices edge up towards $70. It will probably last until around August, when oil prices (if recent history is any guide) will temporarily peak, depending on how the hurricane season pans out. If I still hold all these shares by next December I will probably start to look stupid again. Indeed, having predicted here what might happen, I would be stupid indeed not to learn from last year’s experience.Though I should perhaps not have held on to my hedge beyond August as oil prices started falling, I did at least do something that wasn’t stupid. As I said in December, it would be a mistake to abandon these cheap oil companies when oil prices were low if, as seemed likely, a renewed price hike was on its way in 2007.One cycle to learn from is a seasonal one. The US “driving season” begins on the Memorial Day holiday, the final Monday in May, and ends on the Labor Day holiday, the first Monday in September.The driving season (an odd term which makes it sound like Americans might be tempted to walk at other times of the year) coincides with the peak of gasoline (petrol) demand. While other types of oil, such as heating oil, are in demand during the winter months, it is in the run-up to the driving season that stocks of gasoline become crucial.This is where my holding in refiner Valero comes in. The US is incredibly short of refining capacity. Not a single new refinery has been built in the US for almost 30 years, and none looked like being built until Hurricane Katrina came along in August 2005 and put a significant chunk of the country’s refineries out of operation.Permission was then granted in 2005 to construct one in hurricane-free Arizona, but a local judge has just this month halted work because the site may contain Indian artefacts. In any case, the $3.7bn plant will not be completed until 2011 at the earliest. The lack of new capacity not surprisingly puts a strain on the old plants. The usual refinery shut-downs for maintenance before the driving season begins have been unusually extensive and slow this year, which has hit gasoline stockpiles hard.That leaves Valero, as one of only a handful of pure play refiners sitting pretty. Gasoline prices at a record $3.19 per gallon (equivalent to 35p per litre) may look like a bargain to British eyes, but they are 10 per cent higher than the already hefty levels seen a year ago, and are enough to yield a massive $35 per barrel profit to refiners.It is perhaps not surprising then that Valero shares have climbed from $51 to $78 this year, outpacing the 18 per cent rise experienced in a more crude-orientated oil play such as Apache in 2007. Despite the 50 per cent profit I’ve reaped already on Valero, the stock trades at less than 10 times analyst consensus forecasts for fiscal 2007. No wonder I’m feeling clever now.The tricky part will be choosing the moment to sell. Certainly I would be surprised to be still holding all my Valero stake by the middle of August, but I may even sell up sooner if refineries start to come back on line rapidly. Stupidity or brilliance… it’s all in the price.
87;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2007-03-14T18:52:53Z;Oil prices volatile but base metals resilient;;Oil prices remained highly volatile Wednesday after a sharp fall late in the previous session, but base metals displayed resilience in spite of weakness across equity markets in response to concerns about the deterioration in the US subprime mortgage lending market.The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is due to start its next meeting in Vienna Thursday but as the cartel is not expected to cut output further, traders’ attention focused on the US inventories data released Wednesday.The Energy Information Administration said US crude stocks rose 1.1m barrels last week, below the consensus forecast for an increase of 1.6m barrels.ICE April Brent dipped 22 cents to $61.68 a barrel while Nymex April West Texas Intermediate fell 40 cents to $57.53.Gasoline prices were marginally weaker with Nymex April RBOB trading just under a cent lower at $1.9223 a gallon after gasoline stocks fell 2.5m barrels, in line with the consensus forecast for a 2.4m barrel decrease.The gasoline crack spread – the differential between gasoline and crude – has surged in the past month as unplanned refinery maintenance work has hampered production. Valero Energy shut its 100,000 barrel-a-day gasoline unit at its refinery in St Charles, Louisiana, for two weeks of unplanned maintenance, while Chevron has extended repair work on a fire-damaged San Francisco Bay area refinery for a further three weeks. The EIA said US refinery maintenance dropped 0.2 percentage points to 85.6 per cent last week.The April gasoline RBOB crack traded at $23.22 Wednesday, having doubled in the past four weeks.Nymex April heating oil edged 0.5 cents higher to $1.6956 a gallon after distillate stocks (including heating oil) fell 2.8m barrels, above the consensus forecast for a 2m barrel decrease.Gold slipped 0.5 per cent to $640.00 a troy ounce. Dealers noted that speculative long positions – betting on further price appreciation – remained substantial, and said hedge funds were taking profits from gold to pay for losses elsewhere.Base metals were largely unshaken as low inventories and fundamentals remained supportive approaching the seasonally strong part of the year for demand.Copper eased 0.2 per cent to $6,205 a tonne after a fall of 1,975 tonnes in LME stocks. The International Copper Study Group (ICSG) is forecasting a 4.2 per cent increase in demand for refined copper this year to 17.884m tonnes while production is expected to rise 3.8 per cent to 18.059m tonnes, leaving the market close to balance.Nickel rose 2.5 per cent to $44,700 a tonne after hitting another record at $44,800. Steelmakers are cutting back on buying nickel as the price continues to rocket. Nickel inventories remain critically low with just 2,418 tonnes avaliable to the market and there are fears that cyclone activity in western Australia could further disrupt global supplies.Aluminium fell 0.4 per cent to $2,714.5 a tonne after a fall of 350 tonnes in LME stocks.
88;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2007-01-26T12:42:03Z;Nick Louth: So much for playing it safe;;Hedging can often negate risk, but I never realised it could be such hard work. My wife and I have just spent the weekend laying down a hedge of beech, hornbeam and hawthorn which I hope will protect one windswept edge of our garden for many years. Despite excellent tuition (my wife is a countryside ranger), I’ve got sore arms and shoulders from repeated swinging of the sickle-like billhook.I hope this hedging works better than the piece I did against the oil price last year. I was concerned that if the oil price continued to rise this would hurt equity markets. So, as a hedge, I bought some oil shares. The idea was that these shares would benefit from further oil price hikes offsetting losses in the rest of the portfolio.Throughout 2005 and 2006 I bought a range of shares in oil companies, including explorers Sterling Energy and Roc, gas explorer BG, mid-size US production firm Apache and specialist US refiner Valero. All did well until the end of last summer (though I sold and repurchased some during the May correction), with crude prices reaching a peak of $78.As so often happens, the oil price turned on the US Labor Day holiday in September, which marks the end of the US ”driving season”.When oil prices began to sag in September, the oil-related part of my portfolio (about 15 per cent) began to languish, but the rest of my holdings started to accelerate their recovery from the weaknesses of early summer. I did make some adjustments, immediately selling half my shares in BG for 696p at the end of August when it became clear that a UK gas shortage would not materialise. This was only a 1.5 per cent loss, but the sale of the second tranche in October incurred a 5 per cent loss.So far, so steady, but the effect on oil explorers was more dramatic. Sterling, a professionally-managed outfit with widespread assets from Africa to the Gulf of Mexico, has halved from a peak 32p in May. Australian explorer Roc, which had a promising find in the seas off China, was hard-hit by a dilutive fundraising in December from which UK investors were barred. The shares I bought for 170p are now worth just 115p, though there still appears to be decent upside on exploration prospects.Apache and Valero, my biggest oil holdings, have been disappointing, sliding by around a fifth from their peaks. The upshot was that my portfolio recorded a return of 13.8 per cent in 2006, comparable to the FTSE 100 but behind the mid-cap 250 index. If I hadn’t hedged at all, I would have had an extra 3-4 points of performance. With hindsight I should have been more vigorous in cutting my oil holdings after the August peak, but then I had expected a slide to just $60 a barrel rather than $50.The mistake now, with oil prices lower, would be to abandon the hedge altogether. Apache and Valero are trading at price/earnings ratios of 8 and 5.7 respectively, surely a massive undervaluation considering how much above historic norms oil prices still are. Valero, particularly, would make a tasty morsel for a US oil giant. Though I have trimmed my holdings, I shall retain the bulk of them.So far in 2007, my portfolio has performed well, notching up a 4 per cent gain helped by Tanfield, Genus and Ashtead. Zero-emission vehicle maker Tanfield, with a 25 per cent gain in January, has been the real standout, while US-focused machinery rental firm Ashtead, which I repurchased last year at prices between 130p and 148p, has added 8 per cent. My exit from the stock in May 2006 at 230p turned out to be well timed. Any subsequent gains I now get I expect to be far less than the 1,200 per cent I made on them first time around.This isn’t the only hedging I have done. Eight years ago, having written two novels and secured myself a literary agent, I was preparing to leave my day job. However, just in case it didn’t work, I took on some freelance work writing for this paper and others. It is just as well I hedged my career plans, because the books failed to find a publisher. Plan “B” hasn’t worked out too badly though.Now I’m having another go. Funny Money*, a book based on the columns I write for the Investors Chronicle, is being published on Valentine’s Day. This time I haven’t given up the day job, which is just as well. I wouldn’t want to end up wielding a billhook for a living.*Funny Money: The Investment Diary of Bernard Jones. www.bernardjones.co.uk

Nationwide pump prices for a gallon of petrol averaged $3.105 last week, a rise of almost 2 cents from two weeks ago, according to the latest Lundberg survey.“Although there are some refinery capacity problems, demand is not growing and is probably shrinking with gas at more than $3 a gallon,” said Trilby Lundberg.Valero Energy has started maintenance work on its 95,000 barrels a day refinery in Texas and ConocoPhilips is due to update this week on when production at its 306,000 barrels a day Wood River refinery in Illinois will be fully restored.Nymex August unleaded gasoline traded less than a cent higher at $2.2950 a gallon.On Monday, Spain cut its forecast for this year’s wheat crop to 5.6m tonnes from an earlier estimate of 6.2m tonnes. Fears that the heatwave across Europe will cause harvest shortfalls have pushed trading volumes for agricultural commodities to record highs recently.Euronext.liffe said trading volumes for milling wheat futures reached a record 6,694 lots on Friday. French wheat futures, the benchmark for European wheat prices, traded at €126.5 a tonne yesterday after reaching a two-year high of €131.25 last week.Trading volumes for rapeseed futures and options also reached record highs in July and August respectively.European rapeseed traded at €256.50 a tonne yesterday after reaching a two-week high of €260 a tonne last week.Market users point to a range of factors behind the recent record levels of trading activity. Global cereal inventories stand at relatively low levels at a time when heatwave conditions across Europe have raised fears that the hot weather will have an adverse effect on harvest yields. The removal of Common Agricultural Price subsidies combined with rising prices and increased volatility has encouraged traditional users of derivatives to expand their usage of futures and options to manage exposures.Ian Dudden, director of commodity products at Euronext.liffe said: “market participants are recognising that futures and options rovide a viable mechanism to manage exposure to price volatility at a time when EU government price suports are being removed.”The emerging market for biofuels has attracted new investors and changed the balance of supply and demand for grain and oilseed futures. Hedge funds and proprietary traders are known to be increasingly active in soft commodities, attracted by rising prices and the changes in the underlying duynamics of these markets.Sudakshina Unnikrishnan of Barclays Capital said: “There is definitely a growing interest among the financial community in agricultural commodities, particularly those linked to ethanol such as sugar and corn. Price rises for agricultural commodities have lagged behind the appreciation in metals and across the energy complex and there has also been some switching as a result of the increased volatility in metals prices.”Copper rose 1.9 per cent to $7,170 a tonne amid concerns that workers at Escondida, the world’s largest copper mine in Chile, could vote to strike later this week.Nickel increased 2.2 per cent to $24,150 a tonne after London Metal Exchange stocks fell 270 tonnes to just 5,448 tonnes.Dealers said trading volumes for base metals were thin, leading to choppy price action.Aluminium rose 2 per cent to $2,510 a tonne while zinc increased 1.8 per cent to $3,125 a tonne after a fall of 225 tonnes in LME stocks, continuing a steady decline.

Initial reaction was that its brief statement left it more leeway to discontinue its campaign of tightening interest rates.Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, said the post-decision rally was an expression of investor relief. “The market is breathing a sigh of relief that it’s over and we can now get on with our lives,” he said.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 2.2 per cent, or 26.87 points, at 1,272.87, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 3 per cent, or 62.54 points, at 2,174.38.

100;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2006-05-23T20:43:36Z;Wall Street slides in late trading;;Wall Street turned sharply lower in the last hour on Tuesday erasing gains made earlier in the day. A rise in the price of oil and metals had given momentum to energy and mining stocks, while homebuilders also climbed.“Very simply, the recovery was extremely unimpressive,” said Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Associates “It was based on low volume, and was uninspiring. There was no clear signal today that the market had found a bottom.”“It’s got bear market written all over it,” said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak.Stronger demand for oil sent crude prices rising. Marathon, an oil producer, added 2.4 per cent to $74.17. Valero, an oil refiner, rose 2.8 per cent to $58.69, more than making up for Monday’s losses, which were caused by a refinery fire.Metals also rode a rally, and on Nymex, copper trading had to be suspended for 15 minutes as prices leapt by more than 5 per cent. Phelps Dodgegained 4.1 per cent to $83.06 and Freeport-McMoran, the copper and gold producer, added 2.3 per cent to $55.53.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent, or 5.49 points, at 1,256.58, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.7 per cent, or 14.10 points, at 2,158.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent, or 26.98 points, to 11,098.35.Heinz climbed 5 per cent to $42.98 after an activist shareholder group led by Nelson Peltz called on the food group to cut costs and increase share buy-backs in a plan that could double the share price.

The three have fallen by between 27 and 36 per cent since mid-January on fears that rising rates would hurt the construction sector.Sun Microsystems was less robust, falling 5.5 per cent to $4.29 after investors were told the company was ready to “re-size” by cutting costs and shedding jobs.Adobe Systems lost 3 per cent to $29.02 as it insisted that a tool for creating PDF files in Microsoft’s next version of Office would not hurt sales. Wyeth dipped 3 per cent to $47.40 after it was disclosed that its experimental anti-depressant induced nausea in trials.
101;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2006-04-12T19:58:59Z;Lex: US gasoline/Valero;;"Valero is enjoying its moment in the sun. After years of snapping up cheap assets while margins were horrible, the US refiner has ridden the surge in gasoline prices. Worth $1bn 10 years ago, Valero now has a market value of $39bn. Its share price has jumped 445 per cent since the start of 2004.Is this as good as it gets? On refining margins, probably. The spread between the price of gasoline/diesel and crude oil averaged less than $3.50 a barrel during the 1990s. Last year, in contrast, it averaged $12 and hit $20 last week. There are short-term reasons for the latest spike. Gasoline inventories have started to fall, there are concerns about disruption as producers switch between additives blended into gasoline, and the US summer driving season is approaching. Last year’s painful hurricane season also remains in people’s minds.Refining margins will not stay at $20. But, while they will remain volatile, they are also unlikely to fall back to near 1990s levels. Refining capacity remains tight after years of underinvestment and demand continues to grow. That will slowly tail off if consumers switch to smaller cars or an economic downturn forces them to retrench. But refiners, after so many bad years, are unlikely to suddenly splurge on investment. Even if investment does rise, it takes time to come on stream.Valero shares could yet run further. They trade on 8.5-times 2006 earnings according to Credit Suisse – assuming a $12.50 refining margin. If the margin falls to $9 by 2008, they are still on only 11-times. The onus is now on Valero to push the shares higher. Proving its discipline during the bumper years would be a good start. It is time to return some of its windfall profits to shareholders.- Click here to add your comments

The Nasdaq Composite added 1.5 per cent to 2,314.64, while the S&P 500 gained 0.8 per cent to 1,291.24.Semiconductors put in the best sectoral performance after several upbeat offerings from brokers. National Semiconductor gained 5.1 per cent to $29.47 after Mark Edelstone, at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target, saying seasonally solid mobile phone demand and higher margins would drive a positive earnings surprise.The broker was also upbeat about Advanced Micro Devices, as the company “increased its penetration into the enterprise server and PC markets”. AMD climbed 3.6 per cent to $40.07.Bear Stearns upgraded Altera to “outperform” from “peer perform”, citing, among other factors, attractive valuation and healthy communications spending for 2006.

103;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2006-02-24T21:55:52Z;Oil and poor data rein in Wall Street’s gains;;Wall Street ended a volatile week with a mixed performance on Friday as rising crude prices and continuing concerns about US interest rates reined in gains seen earlier in the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.1 per cent at 11,061.85 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to 2,287.04. The S&P 500, helped by sharp gains in energy stocks, rose 0.1 per cent to 1,289.43.The session capped a choppy week of trading, which saw the Dow lose 0.5 per cent and both the S&P and the Nasdaq edge up 0.2 per cent.Differing inflation readings and volatile crude prices were responsible for the market’s swings.Shares fell on Tuesday after the Conference Board’s leading indicators rose for the fourth successive month, suggesting robust economic growth. However, stocks moved higher the next trading day after benign core inflation data gave hope that the Federal Reserve was almost done with its cycle of monetary tightening.But stocks fell again on Thursday after a drop in jobless claims raised fears of wage-pushed inflation. And on Friday shares put in a mixed performance amid data showing that a decline in aircraft orders at Boeing helped push new orders for US made durable goods down 10.2 per cent in January, the biggest drop in five-and-a-half years.In spite of diverging economic data, James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said most of the figures that came in this week pointed to a strong economy.The week’s trade, he said, was marked by the conflict over whether strong growth is good or bad for stocks. “Most felt that the Fed should be done tightening but the reality is that the economy is too strong for the Fed to quit,” he added.The two biggest US retailers reported fourth-quarter results early in the week, but it was Friday’s earnings miss by Gap which sealed the fate of the sector. The clothing company reported its first annual fall in profit in four years, forcing it to lower its guidance for the current year as it lost customers to rivals like Abercrombie & Fitch. Gap fell 2.1 per cent to $18.43, while Abercrombie, which reported last week, eased 0.5 per cent to $64.92.Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, reported on Tuesday, and although it beat forecasts, the company’s statement on its outlook failed to match expectations. Its shares were down 1.4 per cent on the week to $45.45.Fellow Dow constituent Home Depot was down 0.5 per cent to $41.63, in spite of revealing a better-than-expected 30 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings. Meanwhile, Federated Department Stores failed to impress with its fourth-quarter net-profit increase and fell 1.6 per cent to $70.45.Volatile oil prices caused some uncertainty with energy stocks early in the week but Friday’s explosion at a Saudi Arabian facility and further concerns over Nigerian exports helped crude prices and oil companies higher.Sunoco was on Friday upgraded to “outperform” from “peer perform” by Bear Stearns as the broker expected strengthening refining margins. Its shares were up 2.3 per cent on Friday, but only 1.1 per cent on the week to $77.96.The top weekly gainers in the sector were ConocoPhillips, up 1.3 per cent to $62.73, and Valero Energy gained 3.1 per cent to $56.19.Among other movers, H&R Block, the biggest US tax advisory service, lost 9.1 per cent on the week to $23.01 after saying on Friday it had underestimated its own income tax rate, leaving it owing a further $32m and forcing it to restate its accounts for the second time in six months.Shares of Dana fell to their lowest level in three decades amid mounting concerns about the financial health of the autoparts supplier. Its shares ended the week 64.3 per cent lower at $1.51 after ratings downgrades by Moody’s and S&P sent the group deeper into junk status.It was closely followed by Sherwin-Williams, which slumped 21.6 per cent this week to $41.29 after analysts said the paint maker could face millions of dollars in clean-up costs for homes tainted with lead paint following a jury ruling.News that British utility National Grid was in talks to acquire Keyspan for $7.3bn drove up the shares of the biggest natural gas seller in the US 2.5 per cent this week to $41.41.Following the earnings driven gains of last week for Hewlett-Packard, profit taking hit the stock, dragging its shares 6 per cent lower this week to $32.02.
104;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2006-02-22T21:29:50Z;Wall St higher as core inflation remains benign;;Wall Street moved higher yesterday as interest-rate fears eased after core inflation remained relatively tame, while crude oil prices pulled back amid expectations of further US stockbuilding.Excluding volatile food and energy costs, consumer prices in January were up just 0.2 per cent. Headline inflation rose an unexpectedly large 0.7 per cent, reflecting higher energy costs.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the session 0.6 per cent higher at 11,137.17, while the S&P 500 added 0.8 per cent to 1,292.67 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.9 per cent to 2,283.17.CenturyTel was one of the biggest gainers on the S&P 500 after it announced on Tuesday a $1bn share buyback programme to run over two years. The shares added 4.5 per cent to $36.39.“The buyback equates to 100 per cent of free cash flow over the next two years, which we believe is above consensus for return of capital and should cause shares to approach our $40 price target,” said John Hodulik at UBS.Among the most active stocks traded on the Dow, drugmaker Pfizer gained 2.2 per cent to $26.19. Late on Tuesday a preliminary injunction was granted to prevent India’s Ranbaxy from marketing a generic version of Pfizer’s top-selling Lipitor.Oil prices fell for the first day in four as expectations of higher US inventories today overshadowed geo­political concerns. Lehman Brothers cut its average forecast on crude oil in 2006 to $59.99 a barrel from $65.Energy stocks were hit, and Sunoco fell 3.2 per cent to $75.01, Valero Energy shed 1.8 per cent to $54.55 and ConocoPhillips lost 1.5 per cent to $61.90.But among the stocks to benefit from lower oil prices, US Airways gained 3.5 per cent to $33.64, helped also by broker Bear Stearns, which upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “peer perform”. Continental Airlines added 3.8 per cent to $22.88.Baidu.com, the Nasdaq-listed Chinese internet search engine, reported that fourth-quarter net profit almost quadrupled. The company said it expected first-quarter sales to triple on continued advertising growth and growth in internet subscriptions in China. The shares jumped 5.9 per cent to $54.73.Taser International, the stungun-maker, fell 1.9 per cent to $10.20 after it reported a 98 per cent fall in fourth-quarter earnings due to rising legal costs and falling sales amid a probe into the safety of its products.Sprint Nextel, the country’s third-largest wireless operator, was down 4.5 per cent to $23.80 after fourth-quarter net profit fell nearly 55 per cent due to acquisition costs.Harrah’s Entertainment, the world’s biggest casino operator, was up 0.5 per cent at $72.72 after it unveiled fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations.
105;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2006-02-15T21:46:38Z;Wall St higher as Bernanke upbeat on economy;;Wall Street moved higher on Wednesday as investors mulled over Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s first congressional testimony and weighed risks of higher interest rates and continued economic expansion.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3 per cent higher at 11,058.97, the S&P 500 added 0.4 per cent to 1,280, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,276.43.Merrill Lynch moved higher after it said it had agreed to merge its investment management division with BlackRock to form a company with about $1,000bn in assets under management.Shares in Merrill added 0.2 per cent to $75.30 while BlackRock, the name under which the new company will trade, rose 3.6 per cent to $151.25.Merrill recommended other financial stocks to investors, with upgrades to Bank of New York and Bear Stearns.Bank of New York was an attractive target because of its processing and banking businesses, Merrill said. The stock was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” and gained 1.1 per cent to $33.86.Bear Stearns rose 1.6 per cent to $131.61 after Merrill raised its rating from “neutral” to “buy”. The broker said potential earnings’ growth was not reflected fully in Bear Stearns’ share price.Applied Materials, the world’s largest chip equipment maker, gained 1 per cent to $20.46 in advance of the release of its results after the close.Michael O’Brien at Bear Stearns said: “We want to remind investors that we expect the company to easily beat all guidance, and expect further share price appreciation as investors increasingly realise that the cycle has sustainability.”Abercrombie & Fitch, the clothing retailer, reported a 58 per cent rise in fourth quarter profit, but the shares fell 2.1 per cent to $67.33 after the company warned full-year earnings expectations were unlikely to be met.Myers Industries, the plastics manufacturer, said currency effects hit fourth-quarter net profit, but shares leapt 7.1 per cent to $15.42 after it said it might sell non-core assets.Legg Mason Capital Management revealed in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had built up a 25 per cent stake in Eastman Kodak, making it the photographic company’s biggest shareholder. Shares in Kodak gained 6.6 per cent to $26.54.Helping lift the Dow, was a 2 per cent rise to $71.60 for Caterpillar after Canada’s Finning International, the world’s biggest dealer of Caterpillar-brand equipment, reported quarterly net income jumped 80 per cent.And Merck rose 1.8 per cent to $35.29 after it said regulators had accepted its application for review of its experimental oral diabetes treatment.Although weekly US data showed stockpiles growing, some oil stocks staged a rally, with Marathon Oil adding 1.5 per cent to $67.53 and Valero Energy gaining 1.6 per cent to $50.57.
106;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2006-02-01T18:30:10Z;Crude rebounds after inventories;;High energy prices were in focus on Wednesday after President Bush said the US was “addicted” to oil in his State of the Union address and called for the country to slash its imports from the Middle East by more than 75 per cent by 2025.Oil prices rose in spite of a larger than expected rise in stocks in the latest US weekly inventory data.After an initial fall in reaction to the data, Nymex March West Texas Intermediate rose 63 cents to $68.55 a barrel after the Energy Information Administration reported a 1.9m barrel increase in crude inventories compared with the consensus forecast for 1.1m barrels. IPE March Brent rose 81 cents to $66.80 a barrel.Gasoline prices eased after the EIA surprised the market by reporting a larger-than-expected increase in gasoline stocks, which rose by 4.2m barrels compared with a forecast increase of 1.1m barrels. Nymex unleaded gasoline fell 1.3 cents to $1.7930 a gallon.Traders said the build-up of petrol stocks could remove some of the upward pressure on prices ahead of the summer driving season if it looked like demand growth was cooling.Heating oil prices moved modestly higher after the EIA said distillate stocks fell by 0.2m barrels compared with the market forecast for an increase of 0.5m barrels. Nymex March heating oil traded just under 3 cents higher at $1.8770 a barrelRefineries operated at 87 per cent of operating capacity, going into what is expected to be a very high maintenance season.Bill Klesse, chief executive of Valero, the US refiner, said that supplies of reﬁning products would be tight in the first quarter, with an estimated 6 per cent of US capacity expected to be shut for routine maintenance between January and April.Sugar is increasingly viewed as an energy play – because it is used to make ethanol – as well as a traditional foodstuff. This has pushed prices to 25-year highs in recent weeks.In New York, the March 2006 sugar contract traded at 18.30 cents a pound, up 0.28 cents, after President Bush proposed research into cellulosic ethanol made from cheaper inputs such as grass and straw.Precious metals eased amid profit-taking after strong gains in January. Gold eased fractionally to $568.10/$569.00 a troy ounce after reaching a fresh 25-year high at $572.20 on Tuesday.Russia’s gold production is expected to fall by 1.2 per cent, or two tonnes, to 166 tonnes this year, according to the head of Russia’s gold producers’ union.

107;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-12-29T18:55:01Z;iPod provides Apple with a record-breaking run;;The way to get really rich in US stocks in 2005 was to spot the next fad. Those who foresaw the incredible popularity of the iPod might have invested in Apple Computer, which gained 128.5 per cent.On its own Apple accounted for a rise of 3.7 points in the S&P 500 index – more than any other stock.Google, the dominant internet search engine, gained 120 per cent. But the truly perceptive would have seen the potential to profit from the twin trends of America’s obesity epidemic and the rise of the internet.NutriSystem, a company offering diets and prepared food over the internet, was up 1,547 per cent for the year at one point, before a year-end profit-taking left it with a gain of 1,233 per cent.Its market capitalisation now stands at $1.25bn, and with a day to go before the end of trading for the year, it seemed virtually certain to be the year’s best performing share on the Nasdaq stock exchange.Away from the hot fads, the US stock markets had a tough year and battled to maintain the faith of retail investors. By the close on Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue-chip stocks was effectively flat for the year, up 13 points at 10,796.The S&P 500, the most widely used index, was up 3.8 per cent, which still could not compare with strong gains for stock markets around the rest of the world. Moreover, almost all of the rise in the S&P could be attributed to the high oil price.Energy was by far the best performing sector within the S&P, gaining 29.6 per cent.Valero Energy equalled Apple’s rise of 128.5 per cent to share honours as the S&P’s strongest stock, accounting for 1.61 points of the index’s improvement, while Exxon Mobil, the largest company by market capitalisation, on its own accounted for 3.4 points of the S&P’s rise, second only to Apple.Without the energy sector, the Dow and the S&P would have been in negative territory for the year – though it could be argued that the high oil price was a factor in denting performance elsewhere in the economy. It probably contributed to the 4 per cent fall in airline stocks and the 5.8 per cent fall for industrial conglomerates.Rising petrol prices also did no favours to the sector that suffered the year’s most spectacular crash: the motor industry. Components maker Delphi went into bankruptcy and therefore does not appear in the year-end listings. But even with this exclusion, the year’s six worst performing companies in the S&P were all from the auto sector.Dana, a components manufacturer, suffered the worst percentage fall at 59.7 per cent, while the once mighty General Motors, whose downgrade from the rating agencies roiled the credit markets, fell 53.5 per cent to test historic lows.There were a few success stories. Homebuilders (up 26.7 per cent) benefited from the strong housing market, though fears persist that this will prove to be a “bubble”. Merger activity pushed the once-moribund steel sector up 21 per cent.But in general, as the flat year for the Dow showed, large-caps were out of favour, and emphatically vanquished by small-caps.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained 5 per cent against a 3.8 per cent gain for the Russell 1000 index of large-cap companies.Among the corporate giants to suffer very bad years were telecoms provider Verizon (down 25.3 per cent), Dell Computer (down 27.3 per cent) and mortgage finance group Fannie Mae (down 32.5 per cent).The year also saw a sharp reversal in sentiment towards Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer (down 9.4 per cent), Pfizer, maker of Viagra (down 12.2 per cent), and internet auctioneer Ebay (down 23.7 per cent).With so many large and popular companies out of favour, “value” investing – looking for stocks that appear undervalued – continued to beat “growth” investing, or picking companies with strongly increasing earnings.The Russell 3000 growth index was up 5.95 per cent for the year, against a 7.26 per cent increase for the Russell 3000 value index.Retail investors appeared to vote with their feet. According to Emerging Portfolio Fund Research of Boston, US equity funds have seen a net outflow of $15.4bn for the year, while investors have instead sent money to global and international funds (recipients of $62.2bn) – the first time since 1990 that international funds have received more money than US funds.
108;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-12-22T18:43:06Z;Market Insight: Best and worst US stocks;;"In 2005 the “new economy” resumed its battle with the “old economy” on the US stock market. Two of the year’s most compelling stories were the dazzling success of Google, which showed that it had found a way to make internet search highly profitable, and the collapse in the share price of General Motors.However, the lines between the “old” and “new” economies began to blur, and the market changed its view on the winners and losers from the new technology boom.Finding the winners was more important than usual. The S&P 500 has gained about 4.2 per cent, or 50 points, over the year, making it the least successful of the world’s big stock markets.Earlier this week it stood at 1,264, near its highest level in 4½ years but still far below the peak set almost six years ago. With the market lacking clear direction, the way to make profits was through trading, or successful stock-picking.Beyond Google, other “new economy” names had to contend with new rules as they discovered that their business model had reached maturity.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, noted that the lacklustre performance among computer hardware makers could be attributed to the same ailment that was afflicting the American auto industry – namely market saturation for their product.“When the auto industry first came about, it was high growth because not everyone owned a car,” he said. “But as the market has been penetrated and saturated, growth has slowed. This is the same thing that has been happening to the computer sector.”In the absence of innovations, computer manufacturers, like automakers, shifted their focus to economies of scale to keep their profit margins healthy.The contrasting fortunes of Apple Computer, Hewlett Packard and Dell put this
in focus.Apple Computer, with the runaway success of its iPod MP3 players, was the most spectacular example of innovation. Its shares gained 128.28 per cent – the third best performance among the S&P index constituents. Apple alone accounted for 3.7 points of the S&P’s rise.Hewlett-Packard followed the economy of scale route with a huge and controversial merger with rival Compaq. The gamble appears to have paid off as Hewlett’s shares have gained
36 per cent, or $7.74, to reach $28.87 this year.By contrast, Dell Computer – previously regarded as the “winner” among computer manufacturers – dropped 26 per cent, or $10.95, to $31, suffering the second most severe fall in market capitalisation of any S&P stock.Microsoft, once the archetypal “new” economy stock, also
now appears to have saturated its market. It fell victim to two of the year’s strongest trends – investor disenchantment
with large-cap stocks, which continued to under-perform small-caps, and their
increasing demand for yield.And among internet stocks, Ebay was regarded as the winner from the first wave. The market inflicted a terrible year on the internet auction house, which fell more than
24 per cent, or $14.50, to $44.45.As for the old economy, the disastrous implosion of the auto sector could again be attributed to lack of innovation. General Motors is still the world’s largest automaker, but Toyota of Japan has long done a better job of building cars profitably.The list of the year’s worst performers is taken up by the big carmakers – at start of the week GM and Ford had lost 52 and 45 per cent respectively – and their components manufacturers.The worst performer in the S&P 500 so far this year is Dana, down 61 per cent (although Delphi, now bankrupt, fared even worse).Some things have not changed. Oil continues to be vitally important. With world oil prices rising, energy companies have out-performed all other sectors. Valero Energy enjoyed the strongest percentage gain
on the S&P, rising 133 per cent this year.ExxonMobil, the largest US company, has seen its market capitalisation rise by more
than any other stock. Its 13 per cent gain was enough to raise the S&P by more than
4.5 points."
109;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-10-31T21:23:11Z;Wall Street rallies on M&A and results;;Wall Street rallied for a second straight session on Monday as solid corporate figures and a pick-up in M&A activity buoyed sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.4 per cent higher at 10,440.07, with the broader S&P 500 up 0.7 per cent at 1,206.95. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.5 per cent at 2,120.30.On Thursday, the S&P 500 had been on track for its worst monthly performance since December 2002, at a loss of 4.1 per cent. However, the subsequent recovery cut its monthly loss to just 1.8 per cent. The Dow lost 1.2 per cent in October and the Nasdaq fell 1.5 per cent.“This is the start of an end-of-year rally. Stocks are reasonably priced and they are good value in terms of projected earnings,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.Data on Monday showed that the core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, came in at just 0.2 per cent in September, helping to allay fears that inflation was rising. However, higher energy prices pushed the headline rate to 0.9 per cent.M&A talk helped the market, with Placer Dome surging 20.8 per cent to $19.95 as Canadian rival Barrick Gold submitted a hostile $9.2bn bid, or $20.50 a share, for the gold miner.Retailer Saks rose 8.9 per cent to $18.15 as it sold 142 to Bon-Ton Stores for $1.1bn. Bon-Ton jumped 20.4 per cent to $20.05.Vaccine maker Chiron gained 1.7 per cent at $44.14 as Switzerland’s Novartis upped its offer for the shares of Chiron it does not already own from $40 a share to $45.Oil refiner Valero Energy rose 5.8 per cent to $105.24 as underlying third quarter earnings came in at $4.37 a share, more than double last year and 14 cents ahead of forecasts. The outlook for the fourth quarter was “outstanding”, Valero added.Oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum also reported a doubling of third quarter earnings on the back of higher energy prices, helping the shares firm 2.6 per cent to $78.88.Wal-Mart rose 4 per cent to $47.31 on expectations of October’s same-store sales being 4.3 per cent higher than last year, while Caterpillar rose 3 per cent to $52.59 as it eyed compound annual earnings growth of 15-20 per cent a year until 2010. Apple Computer rose 5.7 per cent to $57.59 as it said its iTunes online service had sold a million videos since launch on October 12.But Kellogg fell 4.9 per cent to $44.17 as the cereal maker reported falling margins despite beating third quarter profit forecasts.Wireless technology company Qualcomm slipped 3.2 per cent to $39.76 after a Merrill Lynch downgrade.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, rose 4.8 per cent to $13.50 on a Lehman Brothers upgrade. With oil prices falling, Continental Airlines rose 7.1 per cent to $12.95, SkyWest firmed 4.5 per cent at $29.31 and Alaska Air gained 5.1 per cent at $31.53.
110;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-10-13T20:02:06Z;Crude down as petrol demand drops;;Oil futures fell on Thursday as the latest US crude inventory showed American demand for petrol, diesel and jet fuel was down on a year ago.However, the report also showed a lower-than-expected rise in US oil supplies and a bigger than expected fall in petroleum product inventories.Concern about the fall in the petroleum product inventories ahead of winter when oil consumption normally increases due to a lift in heating oil demand intensified with the head of Valero, the largest independent refiner in the US, warning of ‘extremely tight’ fuel supplies heading into the winter heating season.IPE Brent for November delivery slid 43 cents to $60.14 a barrel by the end of London trade. However, most of the focus in Brent was on the December contract, as the November contract will expire at the close of trade on Friday. December Brent dropped 72 cents to $60.33 a barrel.November Nymex West Texas Intermediate slipped $1.04 to $63.08 a barrel by the end of the New York session. The decline followed two days of advances.The weekly report from the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the US Department of Energy, said US crude oil inventories increased by 1m barrels from the previous week. The EIA said at 306.4m barrels, US crude oil inventories remain above the upper end of the average range for this time of year.The EIA also said petrol inventories dropped by 2.7m barrels in the week to October 7, putting them below the lower end of the average range.Distillate fuel inventories, which include heating oil and diesel, fell by 3.4m barrels, and are now in the lower half of the average range for this time of year.Despite the declines both gasoline and heating oil futures fell. Nymex November gasoline futures fell 7 cents to $1.7575 a gallon. This equates to a near $3 price fall in a barrel of petrol.Nymex heating oil futures eased 4.77 cents to $1.9680 a gallon. The sharp fall in petrol prices has narrowed the refiner margins on petrol, dropping to about $11.50 a barrel, down from more than $30 a barrel in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.Refiner margins for making a barrel of heating oil remain about $20 a barrel, a price that should see refiners switch to making more heating oil in coming weeks.The EIA report also showed that over the last four weeks, petrol demand has fallen 2.4 per cent from the same period a year ago. Distillate fuel demand is down 4 per cent over the same periods and kerosene jet fuel demand is down 4.4 per cent.Platinum hit a 25 year high of $943 a troy ounce, before falling to $926/$930 in late London trade.
111;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Blockage in the pipeline;;When British protesters angered by the country’s high fuel prices threatened to blockade oil refineries earlier this month, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, pointed the finger in a familiar direction: the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The only way to bring down prices, he declared, was by putting pressure on the oil cartel to step up its production.Opec promptly called his bluff, offering proposing to make available another 2m barrels of oil a day – if consumers wanted it. “We’re offering everything in our pocket and this is my message to Gordon Brown: if he would like to have it, I would be happy to sell it to him,” said Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahd Al-Sabah, Sheikh Ahmad Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, Opec’s president. , slyly offered.Opec’s offer to pump at full tilt The announcement had a limited effect on prices. As Mr Sheikh Al-Sabah well knew, even if Opec were suddenly able to double its output of crude, it would not be going anywhere. The reason: There simply would not be enough capacity to refine the oil into a usable form.In recent years, Opec has deflected the blamed for the high price of oil on to a host of factors, from the falling dollar to speculation by investors in oil futures markets and general geopolitical instability. But the cartel’s latest justification for high oil prices is much more persuasive. The bottleneck in refining represents a ceiling on production that analysts say could take a decade to overcome, with the result meaning that high prices at the petrol pump could be here to stay.Finding and producing oil – the so-called “upstream” part of the business – has captured the public imagination since the 1860s, when prospectors descended on Pennsylvania. in search of the newly-discovered “rock oil”. The downstream business – which transforms the crude into products ranging from petrol to plastic bags – has always seemed humdrum by comparison. International oil companies have long viewed refining as a necessary evil, a low-margin business required to market their oil rather than a potential source of profits. “There are lots of companies that just don’t like refining,” David Knapp, of the Energy Intelligence Group, told a recent conference.Even before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita temporarily took nearly one-quarter of US refining capacity off-line, the global refining system was stretched. , running flat-out to keep up with demand. According to figures from BP, the oil major, global average refinery utilisation increased to 87 per cent in 2004, the highest level for more than one-quarter of a century. In the US, refineries have been running at a 95 per cent utilisation rate this year, according to Purvin Gertz, the oil consultancy. That level, up from a low of 68.6 per cent in 1981, is considered about the maximum achievable on an annual basis. and is up from a low of 68.6 per cent in 1981.Even before the effect of the hurricanes is taken into account, Wood Mackenzie, the oil consultancy, projects that the US will consume almost 32m tonnes of petrol more than it refines this year. Similarly, the country will face a shortfall of more than 10m tonnes of diesel and gas oil. At the moment, Those shortfalls are currently made up through imports, from other parts of the world – from largely from Europe, for example, which produces a surplus of petrol. But it is unlikely that Europe alone will probably not be able to satisfy US thirst for petrol in the future. and is facing up to its own shortfall of diesel. Moreover, Wood Mackenzie predicts that, without major new investment in refining capacity, Europe will be 50m tonnes short of diesel by 2010 – one-fifth of projected demand. Globally, “through the first half of this decade, refining capacity was added at a rate that met only two-thirds of incremental oil demand”Merrill Lynch’s own One key way to measure the soaring demand for oil products is to measure the price gap between a barrel of crude oil and a barrel of refined product, called “crack spreads” in the industry. “The [petrol] crack recorded over the last two weeks has broken all records,” said Philip Verleger, an independent energy economist. “Two weeks ago, margins were nine times higher than the 20-year average.”How did we get here? After a construction boom in the 1970s, many refiners were caught by the sudden downturn in demand in the 1980s and profit margins all but vanished. During the 1990s, the refining industry went through a painful process of consolidation, with oil companies selling off plants they saw as outside their core business. Refining margins hovered close to zero, choking off investment in the sector.Nowhere is the problem so visible as in the US. No new refineries have been built since 1976 and many closed during the lean times. There are less than half The number of refineries in the US than there was has more than halved since in 1981, although improvements in the remaining plants mean that total output has slipped by a smaller 10 per cent. During that time, petrol consumption in the US has risen by 20 per cent.Oil companies have been investing in their refineries – but not necessarily to boost their capacity. For example, regulation by US states and the European Union have has forced refiners to spend ­billions cutting the level of sulphur and other pollutants in the fuels they ­produce.“The US refining and marketing industry has been characterised by unusually low product margins, low profitability, selective retrenchment and substantial restructuring throughout the decade of the 1990s,” the US Energy Information Administration summarised in 1999. “Costs involved in complying with environmental laws have grown substantially during the period and have also affected the profitability of the domestic industry. Consequently, refiners’ abilities to recoup their investment have been impaired.”At the same time, the quality of the oil that refineries are receiving receive has been changing, requiring further major outlays. As supplies of easily refined “light, sweet” crude from places like such as the North Sea dry up, oil companies are having to upgrade their refineries to handle the heavier and more sulphurous “sour” crude that Opec producers now have to offer. The situation is only set to get worse as Opec’s oil makes up a greater proportion of the world’s output.Despite the money already spent, Much more investment is needed to make use of Opec’s oil, which is predicted expected to make up account for more than half of all output by 2020, up from 40 per cent today. Ali Al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, told the World Petroleum Congress on Tuesday that there was a “mismatch between configuration of the refineries and the available sour, heavy crudes”.In 2004, the International Energy Agency, the consuming nations’ watchdog, estimated that the world will need $122bn of investment in refineries by the end of the decade. The industry will need to spend $410bn in refining by 2030 if it is to increase capacity by the 50 per cent the IEA believes will be needed.Suddenly, for the first time in decades, the refining business is hot – one of the most profitable segments of the global energy business. [KEVIN: have you got this fig?] In the past four years, US refining margins have gone from close to zero to around $23 a barrel. In the wake of After Hurricane Katrina, margins soared to around $40 a barrel. Independent refiners such as Valero are making record profits (see below left).So, given the promise of high returns, surely oil companies are falling over themselves to invest? Not yet. The first hurdle is that new refineries cannot be built just anywhere – environmental and planning regulations make it particularly difficult to build one in the US. However, some believe the government could help streamline the approval process, as it did with the siting of liquefied natural gas terminals in the recent energy bill.More importantly, investment decisions taken today could take five years or more to come to fruition. Industry executives worry that margins will not stay this high for long. Speaking about the industry as a whole, Rex Tillerson, president of ExxonMobil, said on Tuesday: “At current crude prices, the reward appears great. This will change. Ours is a cyclical industry – what goes up will invariably come down and will undoubtedly go up again.”Mr Tillerson, who is expected to take over at the helm of the world’s largest publicly traded oil company later and refiner this year, warned that against taking long-term investment decisions should not be taken on the basis of short-term price movements. “Short-term price fluctuations do not significantly affect the pace of our projects at ExxonMobil,” he said. “Nor should ­current prices significantly affect the pace of investment or market ­liberalisation.”A company deciding to commission a refinery today would also have to contend with a market for engineering and construction services that is stretched to the limit. Building costs have doubled tripled or, in some cases, tripled over the past three years, making financial projections even more uncertain. “It’s sort of an Alice in Wonderland deal,” says Matt Simmons, an independent energy banker. “Once we’ve solved one bottleneck, we realise there’s another bottleneck right behind it.”In a survey of new refinery investments in June, Merrill Lynch, the investment bank, described the situation as were“somewhat alarming”. , the investment bank wrote in June. “Despite forming ambitious plans, the industry remains seemingly reluctant to commit hard capital. Only one new distillation project and a small handful of upgrading projects have been sanctioned over the last six months.” The survey It found plans for another 8m b/d of refining capacity to come on-stream worldwide by the end of the decade – enough in theory to satisfy a 1.8 per cent annual demand growth of 1.8 per cent. But most remained in the planning stage and most of those that were going ahead projects were due to start up only after 2009. Two-thirds of the planned capacity additions were in Asia and the Middle East, particularly in China and India, the survey found. But where price caps in those countries could put the fate of many projects into question.Interestingly, it is Opec that seems most keen to build refineries. At its meeting this month, Opec members issued the now-familiar call for consuming nations to boost their refinery investments. But they added a new element to their statement, saying they would start building refineries themselves. Aramco, the Saudi kingdom’s national oil company, Aramco, is considering a plan to boost the output of its Houston-based Motiva refinery in Houston, Motiva, by 45 per cent, along with its joint venture partner, Shell. Saudi Aramco also unveiled plans in June to boost domestic petroleum and petrochemicals refining capacity , including a new 400,000 b/d barrel a day petroleum product export plant, at a cost of $4bn to $5bn. Francisco Blanch, an energy strategist at Merrill Lynch, says Saudi Arabia is keen to expand its downstream refining operations because it is concerned that the global refining bottleneck is putting prices beyond its control. “Saudis are worried they have lost control of the market, and one of the ways to win it back again is through expanding downstream,” because at the moment they cannot do much about the refining tightness,” said Mr Blanch.says Francisco Blanch, an energy strategist at Merrill Lynch.Kuwait is also moving into the downstream sector. and looking to build refineries in the US. Nawaf al-Sabah, assistant managing director and legal counsel at the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, said says the prime minister of Kuwait had offered to build an oil refinery in the United States US during a visit to Washington in July. The offer This was renewed after Hurricane Katrina knocked out several refineries along the US Gulf coast last month.Mr Nawaf said that KPC would like wanted to build the refinery, which will would cost more than $3bn, in partnership with an international oil company. But that is was not proving easy. , he said. “We have to overcome a very difficult hurdle, and that is that the [international oil companies] don’t want to invest in new refineries,” he said. “We are willing to accept a lower rate of return for this type of investment because we see it as a more strategic investment.”Many international oil companies deny there is much of a problem. This summer, Jeroen Van der Veer, Shell’s chief executive, Jeroen Van der Veer, commented that he did not see any tankers of crude sitting idle for want of refining capacity.Although no refineries are being built, companies are managing to squeeze squeezing more out of their existing plants, a process known as “capacity creep”. ExxonMobil says it is adding 150,000 b/d barrels a day of additional capacity every three years by tweaking its plants – roughly the equivalent of one mid-sized refinery. But many analysts are sceptical doubt such incremental moves can solve the problem. They say that “capacity creep” has largely reached its limit and that additional enhancements will would require much greater investment.Frustrated by the perceived inaction of the oil companies, some consumers are taking things into their own hands. Sir Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, has declared that he will said he intends to build his own refinery, at a cost of $2bn. Like all airlines, Virgin has been hard hit by soaring jet fuel prices. “The world is short of up to 20 oil refineries and the oil companies are not investing in new ones,” Sir Richard complained recently.If oil companies do not invest part of their huge profits in new refineries, some analysts believe that governments could use taxation policy to push them to do so. Thierry Breton, the French finance minister, recently threatened oil companies with a windfall tax and managed to extract pricing concessions from Total and BP. France’s Prime Minister, Dominique de Villepin, France’s prime minister, has also made public calls called for Total of France to put more of its oil profits into refining.Tempting though it may be for governments under pressure over soaring fuel prices, state intervention would be is unlikely to help: any new refineries could take between five and ten years to come on-stream. In the meantime, refinery capacity could limit the consumption of oil products and, in turn, the production of crude. Consumers may simply have to adjust.“The grim reality is that it will take at least a decade [to solve the bottleneck],” said Mr Simmons. “All we can do now is mitigate against getting deeper in a hole.”Dealing with ‘sour’ crudes helps acquisitive Valero hit the sweet spotFew companies have benefited more from the squeeze in global refining capacity than Valero Energy, which has transformed itself from the owner of a single refinery in Texas in the early 1980s to becoming the biggest refiner in North America this summer following the $8bn takeover of Premcor, its rival, writes Kevin Morrison. Valero’s refining capacity of 3.3m barrels a day is just below that of ExxonMobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron Texaco.The company’s emergence as a significant refiner follows a series of takeovers over the past 25 years. It acquired refineries that the oil majors were forced to divest after a spate of big mergers in the late 1990s, while it also bought a number of refiners from over-stretched energy merchants and smaller refining companiesthat found it hard to deliver a good return to shareholders during the lean 1990s, when refinery margins were wafer-thin.Analysts say each of the acquisitions allowed Valero to add refinery capacity much more cheaply than it could have done by building its own refineries.The acquisitions look astute for William Greenhey, Valero’s chairman and chief executive since 1979. Refiner margins have climbed to record levels of about $20 a barrel and analysts expect margins to remain in double digits for at least the next two to three years.The twin effects of growing refining capacity and improved margins have sent Valero’s earnings, dividends and share price soaring in the past five years. It earnings rose more than fourfold between 2000 and 2004 and net income, which last year was $1.8bn, is this year expected to be well above $2bn. Dividends have almost doubled this decade.The company’s shares, meanwhile, are up 150 per cent so far this year, giving it a market value of $35bn and pushing into the upper bracket of Fortune 500 companies.This year’s share price performance underlines the premium that investors are attaching to the listed independent refiners in the US. Fellow refiners Holly, Tesoro, Frontier Oil and Sunoco have all seen their shares double this year.Central to Valero’s strategy is the reconfiguration of its refineries so they are able to turn lower grades of oil, known as heavy sour oils, into petroleum products with ever decreasing amounts of sulphur. The lower grades of oil are cheaper than the higher grades, providing a better margin for Valero.“Valero saw early on that the oil was going to become heavier and tighter regulations meant that products were going to have to be cleaner,” says Philip Verleger, an independent petroleum economist and a former Valero director.Valero has also spread its influence in other parts of the oil and gas sector through its 40 per cent-owned Valero LP, which this year became one of the biggest oil and gas storage and pipeline owners in North America with the $2.7bn takeover of Kaneb Pipe Line Partners.
112;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Rita downgrade cheers Wall Street;;Wall Street gave out a collective sigh of relief on Thursday after Hurricane Rita was downgraded to the second-strongest category, traggering off a comeback rally on hopes that the damage could be less bad than feared.Rita continued to be head towards the Texas coast, where 26 per cent of US crude oil refining capacity is located. Coming a month after Hurricane Katrina, Rita raised further fears about the possible impact of the storm on the US refining industry, gasoline prices and the broader economy.Concerns about energy supplies showed up in a rally for crude oil, natural gas and gasoline futures.Marc Pado at Cantor Fitzgerald, referring to Galveston, Texas, where Rita was reportedly likely to make landfall, said earlier in the session: “The citizens of Galveston are under a mandatory evacuation, and so are investors.”However, Rita’s apparent slowdown cause stocks to come back in the last two hours of trade amid hopes this hurricane will only be as bad as Katrina, rather than far worse.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had put on 0.5 per cent to 10,424.30, while the S&P 500 index was 0.3 per cent better at 1,206.21. The Nasdaq Composite index advanced 0.2 per cent at 2,111.14.A sobering note came from Arthur Cashin, managing director at UBS, who warned that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both failed to stay above their 90-day moving average on Wednesday. “Since the May rally began, the 90-day moving average has served as a protective net under those indices. Now we are working without a net,” said Mr Cashin. Neither index rebounded sufficiently yesterday to erase Wednesday’s gains.Exxon Mobil closed flat at $64.98 as it said it had shut facilities in Texas. Valero Energy, a refiner in the same region, followed suit. Its shares were 0.3 per cent off at $112.80, but are up 149 per cent this year.In earnings news, General Mills added 3.4 per cent to $46.19 after the breakfast cereal company reported above-expectations quarterly earnings and reiterated its outlook.In a further reflection of the strength of the housing market, KB Home reported almost doubled quarterly earnings and saw its shares add 4.2 per cent to $73.70.In retail, Bed, Bath & Beyond shares put on 6.1 per cent to $39.70 after the purveyor of linen, kitchen and other house wares reported an 18 per cent rise in profits.Calpine shares were 0.4 per cent off at $2.66 as the utility company said it was considering its options after the Bank of New York said it planned to withhold proceeds from an asset sale until Calpine had resolved disputes with bondholders about the way it uses cash.JetBlue recovered from earlier turbulence to rise 1.2 per cent to $17.99 after one of the low-cost carrier’s planes had to perform an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport with damaged landing gear.In mergers, Ace Cash Express agreed to buy some of Popular’s cheque-cashing stores for $36m. Shares lost 1.7 per cent to $19.25.
113;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-09-22T09:05:52Z;Houston evacuates as Rita roars in;;At least one million people on Thursday were fleeing the Texas coast as Hurricane Rita, now a category four storm, homed in on the Gulf of Mexico.Houston, heart of the US oil industry, is continuing the mass evacuation of low-lying, flood-prone areas of the Texas city as the threat intensified.Oil prices continued on an upward path as Rita approached Gulf of Mexico production facilities and forced six Texan refineries to shut down. A quarter of total US refining capacity is based in Texas, and the US government’s Energy Information Administration warned the hurricane could have a “substantial impact”.Energy companies ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have ordered staff to leave platforms in the Gulf, which account for nearly a third of US oil output.About five per cent of US refining capacity is still out of commission. Global Insight, an economic consultancy, said another 20 per cent of capacity was at risk of temporary shut downs. “If Hurricane Rita caused significant damage to multiple refineries, it could be a national disaster since we still have four refineries shut down because of Katrina,” said Bill Greehey, chief executive of Valero, America's largest refiner.The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday played down the impact of high oil prices on the global economy. Impact of higher energy costs had been “surprisingly moderate” on growth and inflation, the Fund's twice-yearly World Economic Outlook said.It reduced only very modestly its global growth forecast but noted risks to the outlook were “slanted to the downside”. High oil prices posed a “clear and present danger”, said Raghuram Rajan, IMF chief economist.Hurricane Rita is forecast to hit land on Friday, somewhere between northern Mexico and Louisiana but most likely Texas. Experts said preparations in Houston had so far been exemplary after the inadequate response to Hurricane Katrina damaged the credibility of federal, state and local governments.In New Orleans, the city devastated by floods last month, engineers rushed to repair severely damaged levees. Some estimates suggested even three inches of rain would overwhelm the flood protection system.Many Houston residents, who witnessed first-hand the horror of Hurricane Katrina, were urgently preparing last night to escape the storm, booking nearly all hotels in Austin, San Antonio and Dallas. Panic buying emptied shelves of batteries, water and other emergency provisions at groceries and superstores.Houston Mayor Bill White asked those in vulnerable areas to leave, companies to release non-essential staff and schools to close as the storm headed for the US' fourth most heavily populated city. To leave Houston will be mandatory for those living in mobile homes and storm surge zones at 6am on Thursday.

118;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-09-18T19:53:01Z;Refiners defer maintenance to keep oil flowing;;US refiners are putting off scheduled maintenance to their plants in response to a White House call to maximise petrol and diesel production following Hurricane Katrina. The move has raised concerns about long-term risks among analysts, energy executives and safety officials.The Energy Department told refiners informally that they should boost production after the storm severely damaged oil and gas facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, sending petrol prices rocketing to record highs. Although the refiners say no formal request has been made, they admit that the White House made its position known. Several US refiners have since said they would cut back on maintenance.“We plan to review all planned maintenance and will defer any maintenance projects unless a delay will jeopardise the safety or reliability of our plants,” said Mary Rose Brown, a spokeswoman for Valero, one of the biggest US refiners.Yet analysts note maintenance, by its very nature, is essential to keeping refineries in proper working order.“Deferring refinery maintenance has its risks,” says JP Morgan's analysts. “Working a refinery at full capacity and without necessary tune-ups can damage units, resulting in potentially very costly and extended unplanned repair work, which would be very unwelcome, given the tight market conditions.”Indeed, one energy executive said liability issues could arise if an accident takes place, leaving the White House open to blame.Craig Stevens, a spokesman for the Department of Energy, said several oil executives had told Samuel Bodman, the energy secretary, that they would put off maintenance. His response was, if that was something they needed to do, that was fine, but he would never condone any activity that would put workers in danger, Mr Stevens said.“As far as I know, the administration has not asked anyone to put off maintenance,” Mr Stevens said. “There is a big difference between painting a wall and changing a valve.”Daniel Horowitz, the director of congressional, public and board affairs at the US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, said he could not comment on any White House directive, as he had not seen it. Nonetheless, the CSB's position on safety-critical maintenance is clear.“Certain preventative maintenance is essential to refinery safety,” Dr Horowitz said. “Even in the crisis, if the goal is to keep petroleum supplies flowing smoothly, safety needs to remain a high priority. We've seen the effect in Texas City that a major accident can have on gasoline supplies.”BP's Texas City refinery suffered an explosion March 23, killing 15 people and injuring more than 170 in the deadliest refinery accident in more than a decade. In August, the CSB accused the UK oil company of “systemic lapses” and called for an independent review of safety at its five US plants.That was not an isolated accident: in the weeks leading up to the CSB call for BP to take stock of its US operations, at least 20 refinery accidents and stoppages took place across the country, as rising demand for fuel saw the global refining system running at 95 per cent of capacity, up from 75 per cent two decades ago.Since then Hurricane Katrina has knocked out four key refineries, leaving analysts projecting that up to 5 per cent of US refining capacity will be down for several months at a time when US refiners were struggling to meet demand.Fuel prices have, subsequently, been rising, encouraging those refineries that are operational to run as close to full capacity as they can get.“People are going to run as hard as they can,” said Jamal Qureshi, market analyst at PFC Energy, the consultancy. “The price incentives are there.”
119;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-09-02T18:10:08Z;Lex: US refining;;Google eat your heart out. Over the last year, decidedly old-economy oil refining has proved more attractive for investors than internet search.Shares in Valero, the largest independent US refiner, are up 226 per cent, compared with Google's 186 per cent.There are obvious reasons. After years of horrible margins, the last few have produced a remarkable bounce, as refining supply and demand have come into tighter balance. Oppenheimer estimates that the historical margin of $4-$5 a barrel on refined products, has risen to nearer $10 over the past three years. Meanwhile, with the latest supply constraints from Hurricane Katrina, margins have spiked higher and remain over $30.
120;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-09-01T20:45:16Z;Wall Street resilient as energy woes persist;;US stocks showed resilience on Thursday in the face of a catalogue of market-negative developments.Participants reacted calmly to disappointing economic data, rising oil prices and mounting concerns about the effects of Hurricane Katrina, focusing instead on a potential silver lining: an end, or a severe curtailment at least, to the interest-rate tightening policy of the Federal Reserve.By the close of trade, the S&P 500 had edged up 1.26 points to 1,221.59 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.97, or 0.2 per cent, to 10,459.63. The tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 4.19 points to 2,147.90.The mixed performance comes after major market measures rallied about 1 per cent on Wednesday.On the economic data front, consumer spending rose 1 per cent in July, buoyed up by deep discounts on offer from auto makers.Personal income rose 0.3 per cent, down from 0.5 per cent in June. The combination of rising spending and slowing income growth sent the personal savings rate to minus 0.6 per cent, the lowest level in the 46 years the US government has tracked this measure.Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index posted an unexpected fall to 53.6 in August.Ed Yardeni, economic strategist for Oak Associates, suggests that investors believe that gas prices and potential shortages over the Labor Day weekend will slow the economy enough to curtail the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases.He says Wall Street also believes the economy will rebound when the energy infrastructure is restored, adding: “I agree with this upbeat outlook following the grim disaster.”Banc of America strategist Tom McManus agreed that the prospect of a curtailed rate-hiking cycle was cheering Wall Street.He said that the yield on the two-year Treasury, a sentiment gauge on rate moves, had fallen from just over 4 per cent to 3.7 per cent, suggesting that the market was “betting that there’s only one tightening left”.Energy stocks remained among the hottest performers. Valero Energy rose 2.8 per cent to $109.50, XTO Energy climbed 2.4 per cent to $40.77 and ExxonMobil tacked on 2.97 per cent to $61.68.Another big winner was Chiron, whose shares were up 17.81 per cent to $42.93 after Novartis made a $4.5bn bid to buy the remainder of the drug company. Shares of Novartis added 1 per cent to $49.19.Elsewhere, retailers had a mixed day as strong August sales reports were offset by concerns about September.Wal-Mart rose 0.3 per cent to $45.09 after posting a 3.3 per cent rise in sales, Costco edged up 0.5 per cent to $43.18 and Target declined 1.8 per cent to $52.78 despite posting a 6.3 per cent sales increase.
121;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-08-31T20:19:37Z;Wall Street weathers Katrina and data;;"Wall Street held steady, despite having to absorb disappointing economic data and further fall-out from Hurricane Katrina’s assault on New Orleans and the US south. The markets were supported in part by the Bush administration’s decision to tap the strategic petroleum reserve.By the close of trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 68.7 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 10,481.52, the Nasdaq Composite rose 22.33 points, or 1.1 per cent, to 2,152.09 and the S&P 500 rose 11.9 points, or 1 per cent, to 1,220.31.Energy prices have loomed over the equity markets for weeks, culminating in $70 per barrel oil amid fears that Katrina’s havoc in the Gulf of Mexico would disrupt production, and oil refining and distribution.But oil prices for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange receded yesterday after Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said the US would tap the SPR to ease concerns and ensure a steady supply of oil.Meanwhile, US gross domestic product for the second quarter increased 3.3 per cent, below the 3.4 per cent forecast by economists. The figure had been revised down from 3.5 per cent.The National Association of Purchasing Management said manufacturing in Chicago contracted in August for the first time in two years, suggesting higher oil prices were taking their toll.The NAPM-Chicago’s Business Barometer fell to 49.2 from 63.5 in July; readings below 50 signal a contraction.Energy stocks were among the best performers. Sunoco climbed 5.6 per cent to $72.61, Valero Energy added 10 per cent to $106.50 and TransOcean added 2.6 per cent to $59.04.The S&P 500 energy index was up 2.6 per cent. The energy sector’s gains accounted for 25 per cent of the S&P 500’s direction, posting the highest gains of any sector .The worst-performing sector was the S&P 500 insurance index, which was flat on concerns about the fallout from Hurricane Katrina.American Insurance Group was up 0.1 per cent to $59.04 and Allstate was down 0.8 per cent to $56.21. Since Hurricane Katrina hit on Monday, Allstate’s shares have fallen by more almost 4 per cent.Shares of Tenet Healthcare were off 3.8 per cent to $12.18 after the hospital chain said it had been forced to close six facilities due to Katrina.Shares of Tiffany rose 12.3 per cent to $37.42 after the luxury jewellery retailer posted better than expected earnings and raised its guidance for the year.Other consumer cyclicals, such as home builders D.R. Horton and Champion Enterprises rose during the session. D.R. Horton rose 7.2 per cent to $36.92 and Champion increased 15.6 per cent to $13.33."
122;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-08-30T22:22:40Z;Oil majors count the cost of Katrina;;As the oil industry on Tuesday assessed damage done by Hurricane Katrina to rigs, pipelines and refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, pressure continued to build on oil and gas prices.“At some point the relentless drumbeat of news driving oil and gas prices higher is sure to stop, but we gave up holding our breath about two years ago,’’ said Ken Sill, head of CSFB’s oilfield services and equipment research group. “Katrina is just another example of how life interferes with plans and projections in the energy complex – uncertainty remains a constant.’’He said damage reports for rigs and production facilities would dribble out more slowly than normal because of mandatory evacuations, flooding and power outages that mean there are few personnel in place to go offshore and inspect damage.At this point, Chevron appears harder hit than any other oil company.It had 160 platforms that faced hurricane force winds and 230 that were exposed to the lower-force tropical winds, according to rigzone, the industry website.David O’Reilly, Chevron chief executive, said experience of previous hurricanes suggested it could take days to assess accurately the extent of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina even after initial aerial surveys.“My caution is, don’t count on the initial assessment to tell the whole story,” he said in an interview in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. “It didn’t the last time, and it may not this time. And there’s a lot more damage onshore to the communities onshore than there was from [last year’s Hurricane] Ivan.”He said some people had at first dismissed Ivan’s impact as nothing. “As we really got into it as an industry – I’m not talking about Chevron alone –…we found lots of challenges, pipelines that had been dislocated, so that even if our platform was up and running we had nowhere to put the oil.”In total, hurricane Katrina has shut down more than 1.4m barrels of oil a day, about 7 per cent of US demand. The number is almost exactly equal to the maximum amount of spare oil capacity left in Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest supplier of oil, which has already offered to increase production to make up for the shortfall.Nearly 2,800 platforms, more than 500 of them manned, were within Katrina’s path. About 1,100 of those platforms were exposed to hurricane force winds in excess of 74 miles an hour, before Katrina faded into a storm.The Mars platform, one of the Gulf’s biggest producers of oil and gas, has sustained some damage, Royal Dutch Shell, the operator, said. But not only production wells have been affected.Exploration rigs, of which there are almost no spares available worldwide because of surging demand from oil companies keen to cash in on the high oil prices, were also within the path of Katrina.More than half of the 231 rigs exploring for oil in the Gulf were hit by Katrina. Overall 117 rigs, valued at a total of $7bn (€5.7bn, £3.9bn) had to weather the storm, rigzone said.Valero, a top US refiner, estimates it will be up to two weeks before its St Charles refinery can re-start: the facility still has no power, experienced 3ft of flood water in some units and will have to repair pumps, electric motors and electrical switchgear. Valero also suffered minor damage to its cooling towers, and insulation was knocked off several tanks.“We do not know when employees will be allowed to return to the area and begin reporting back to work,” said Mary Rose Brown, Valero spokeswoman, said: “We are very happy to hear that crude will be available from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.” Ms Brown said. “This gives us confidence that we will have the crude we need when our St Charles refinery is ready to start up again.”Many smaller producersfirms, for which the Gulf of Mexico represents a larger share of total revenues, are likely to be most hurt.The Gulf of Mexico is a primary source of light sweet crude, said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the industry consultancy, to explain the importanceof the area to the industry. Light sweet crude can be used by virtually all refineries, which makes it essential at a time of heightened demand. The loss of its production, therefore, is particularly damaging.“Up until now, people thought that politics was the big risk to the business,’’ Mr West said. “Now weather is proving to be just as big.’’So far few crews – this will change as day goes by – have been dispatched to the platforms to assess damages, although some first impressions from the air were being collected yesterday. But floating rigs – including two owned by Royal Dutch Shell, Europe’s second largest energy group – and even rigs stuck in bridges have been sighted.Mr Sill said it would probably be late this week before the market knew the full impact of the storm on rigs, and even longer for the impact on production facilities, as workers needed to physically inspect them. “We assume there could be some supply disruptions and rig damage given the severity of the storm,’’ he said.The share prices of the big oil and gas companies were trading higher yesterday, on expectations that the higher commodity prices arising from supply disruptions would benefit their bottom lines. Yet Mr West noted that the companies also stood to losemuch from damage to their equipment and facilities.
123;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-06-29T16:38:44Z;Market Insight: Wall St braces for Fed’s rate decision;;Wall Street is bracing for the 105-minute thrill ride of the summer. I refer not to the latest Hollywood blockbuster but to Thursday’s interest-rate decision by the US Federal Reserve.The fact that the Fed’s decision coincides with the end of the second quarter could lead to volatility, particularly in strong sectors like energy and laggards in the tech and auto industries. US money managers have less than two hours to react and make their portfolios presentable.Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at JP Morgan Private Client Service, says: “The last hour and forty-five minutes will be frantic in terms of trying to reposition portfolios on the back of the news from the Fed.”And then there is the window-dressing. Fund managers are loath to admit it, but many try to put the best gloss on their strategies before they have to reveal their end-of-quarter holdings. No one wants to look underweight in an area that has done well, so they are likely to buy top performers and dump poor stocks.Analysts say energy stocks would be one target for window-dressers who are underweight on the sector and want to flatter their portfolio.Mr Caffrey says: “It has been a very frustrating year for everyone, and the market hasn’t made particular progress. When things are so close to break-even, you can expect people to take whatever opportunity for real gain to scrabble ahead.”So far this year, the best performer has been energy, up 19.4 per cent as of midday Wednesday, paced by Valero Energy and Unocal, up 74 per cent and 51 per cent respectively. Carmakers have lagged. Losers include eBay, off 43 per cent, and JDS Uniphase, down 51 per cent.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said the window-dressing effect would be fleeting. “It has an impact on the day but is then reversed in the first week of the next quarter anyway.”Another influence, says Philip Roth, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, is re-indexing. As companies grow or contract, they may move into or out of indices such as the Russell 2000 of smaller companies. This will force indexed funds to dump or buy stock in those companies. The effect is short-lived.“It’s more of a media event. There’s no analytical value,” he says. “Even if it does have an effect it will be one day only, and then we’ll all go back to worrying about the economy, oil prices and interest rates.”Interest ratesare never far from investors’ thoughts.“It can be like taking a long drive with a group of children,” says Mr Caffrey. “You get the constant ‘Are we there yet?’ They’re waiting for when the Fed stops raising rates and the latest news headline.”Investors will be focusing as much on Mr Greenspan’s tone as on his decision. “I don’t get into the Fed guessing game. But I will say I have never seen such a difference of opinion on interest rates,” says Mr Roth. “There are some who say the Fed has tightened enough, some who say it won’t be the last, and others who say it will ease by the end of the year.”As with every summer blockbuster, memories of chaos and destruction fade as punters look forward to the next epic.As Mr Paulsen puts it, “The bigger impact could come the following day, with a report from the Institute for Supply Management completely washing away whatever Greenspan says.”

Five successive sessions of mildly positive gains heartened bulls that the rally that began in mid-April looked intact.Leading the gainers on Friday was the homebuilding sector, after strong results from KB Homes and positive comments from analysts.A spike in oil prices, another of the week’s main themes, helped oil companies and gave a further boost to the Dow Jones Industrial average which closed up 0.4 per cent at 10,623.07. At 1,216.96 points the S&P 500 had gained 0.5 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was virtually unchanged at 2,090.11.Over the week, the Dow was 1.1 per cent higher, with the S&P adding 1.6 per cent. The Nasdaq also gained 1.3 per cent.Also adding to animal spirits were new figures indicating that US consumers felt more confident in June.The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index increased to 94.8 from 86.9 in May. Wall Street paid less attention to news that the US current account widened by a larger-than-expected 3.6 per cent to a record $195.1bn in the first quarter.The positive outlook among consumers is perceived as a bullish sign for an economy powered by discretionary spending and helped to counteract yet another rise in oil prices. However, not all market participants were convinced that all was well with consumers.“We’re cautiously optimistic about the markets short term, however we are still very concerned about the long term, particularly consumer debt levels,” said Eric Kallen, managing director of Hayek Kallen Investment Management in Fairhope, Alabama.Crude contracts hit record highs in New York trade at $58.60.

In another positive for the oil sector, refiner Valero Energy rose 4.25 per cent to $79.95 after forecasting better-than-expected second-quarter earnings.The house-builder KB Homes became the star-turn of the market after it announced a 78 per cent increase in earnings despite persistent jitters about a possible housing bubble.

The stock fell 3.3 per cent to $31.34.Morgan Stanley fell 1 per cent, taking its share price to $51.38 in the wake of reports that the bank is considering selling its Discover credit card unit.Goldman Sachs was up by 1.12 per cent to $103.80 despite more bad news for the bank, which reported weaker-than-expected second quarter results on Thursday. While many analysts remained bullish about its prospects, Wachovia Securities cut the bank’s rating to “market perform” from “outperform”, citing earnings volatility.General Motors shares rose 0.2 per cent, to $35.68 after falling earlier in the week on news that its unions were balking at proposed healthcare cuts.

HP shares rose 9.1 per cent for the week. Gateway, a rival computer maker, jumped 7.7 per cent. Although a new $45m contract to supply computers to the University of Arizona appeared to spark the move, there was some speculation that investors were moving to cover short positions on the stock amid rumours that Bailey Coates, a hedge fund, had liquidated its holdings in the company.A bleak sales outlook from Corning, the biggest maker of glass for use in computer screens and other digital equipment, helped keep gains in check. Shares in the group fell 2.7 per cent for the week after it warned that sales growth could be weaker than first thought.Energy stocks led the way on Thursday as bargain-hunters swooped following the sector’s recent losing streak. ExxonMobil, the biggest US oil producer, edged up 0.6 per cent this week to $54.01 after it agreed to sell some west Texas gas interests to a rival.

The S&P 500 rose 1 per cent to 1,185.56, and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3 per cent to 2,030.65.Investors welcomed a government report that showed consumer prices rising in line with expectations last month. The consumer price index rose 0.5 per cent in April, but after stripping out fuel and food costs, core inflation was flat.Easing fears of a trade war over China’s currency peg also gave a boost to trading a day after the US Treasury set a deadline for China to revalue the renminbi.A mixed bag of economic reports on Tuesday pushed US stocks lower for most of the day. They later rallied to end higher after the US Treasury eased fears about a possible trade war by calling on China to take moderate steps toward revaluing its currency.Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, said worries about inflation had distracted investors from signs pointing to underlying strength in the US economy. “People are trying to determine which way the winds are going to blow,” he said, rather than focusing on investing.Stronger-than-expected results from Hewlett-Packard were cheered by investors. Profits at the computer maker last quarter beat forecasts, sending shares up 4.6 per cent to $22.55.Gains were kept in check after HP lowered its second-quarter guidance, however.

The S&P 500 rose 1 per cent to 1,165.69, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9 per cent to 1,994.43.The leading US indices fell slightly last week amid disappointing corporate reports and concerns about slowing economic growth. On Monday, the Federal Reserve’s “Empire State” index added to the economic uncertainty after it showed an unexpected drop in manufacturing activity in New York state last month.Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said: “This is awful. The survey is much weaker than we expected, and it supports our view that the soft patch is not over.”Wall Street’s gains strengthened throughout the day, however, as most investors brushed off the downbeat report. Falling oil prices gave equities an early boost. Crude futures later recovered to trade modestly lower by the closing bell.On the merger front, attention turned to UPS, the express shipper, which revealed a deal to buy Overnite Transportation Corp, a US rival, for $1.3bn in cash. UPS agreed to pay $43.25 a share for Overnite – a 46 per cent premium over Friday’s closing price. The news sent Overnite shares up 43.8 per cent to $42.52. UPS shares rose 1.5 per cent to $73.20.Retailers led gainers after Lowe’s, the hardware chain, reported higher profits for the quarter. The company’s shares rose 5.6 per cent to $55.80 even though tearnings fell slightly short of some Wall Street estimates. Home Depot, Lowe’s biggest rival, rose 3 per cent to $37.37 ahead of its quarterly results on Tuesday.Energy groups were the biggest laggards of the day in spite of oil’s late recovery.Exxon Mobil, the oil producer, slipped 0.6 per cent to $53.35. Valero Energy, the refiner, fell 1.8 per cent to $60.66.Drug companies attracted attention after several groups published new clinical data during a big medical conference at the weekend. Celgene, the biotechnology group, rose 4.5 per cent to $38.65 after a blood cancer drug showed good results in clinical trials. Onyx, a rival, fell 14.3 per cent to $27.29 amid concerns that the company’s flagship cancer drug could face competition from a rival drug being produced by Pfizer, the US drugs group. Pfizer shares rose 1.3 per cent to $28.23.PanAmSat, the satellite operator, slipped 1.5 per cent to $18.12 after it reported a modest profit in its first set of quarterly results following the company’s initial public offering in March.Investors in Morgan Stanley were unmoved after a court ordered the bank to pay an aggreived client more than $600m in damages.

128;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-05-05T20:24:05Z;Wall St falls after automakers’ ratings cut;;Falling shares among some titans of US industry dragged the broader stock market lower on Thursday.

129;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-04-29T21:00:19Z;Fears of slowing demand haunt crude market;;"The 10 per cent slide in US benchmark crude oil futures this week reflected concerns about rising US inventories and signs of a slowing US economy. It has set the tone for prices to fall further in the short term.The decline in the front-month West Texas Intermediate contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange was greater than the 5 per cent slide in Brent futures traded in London. This left Brent at a premium to the WTI contract, even though it is the latter that has traditionally traded at a premium.Philip Verleger, an oil consultant at PK Verleger, said this change in pricing for Brent and WTI reflected the fact that more high-quality light, sweet crudes, which are produced in the North Sea and west Africa, are being exported to China, where refineries are mainly equipped to refine lighter crudes.Mr Verleger said this had led to more lower-grade crudes being exported to the US, where refiners such as Valero and ExxonMobil have configured plants to process higher sulphur crude into petrol, diesel and jet fuel.“The arbitrage to sell Brent crude into the US market has gone,” he said. But this pricing differential may not last as current forward pricing for both WTI and Brent shows WTI prices rising well above Brent prices from September onwards.West Texas Intermediate for June delivery settled down $2.05 on Friday at $49.72 a barrel, a fall of 10 per cent on the week and the first time since February 18 that Nymex crude has settled under $50. In London, Brent crude fell $1.39 to $51.09.Mr Verleger said a lot of this year’s price increases had been driven by the petroleum product market as gasoline prices have risen more than crude prices. Likewise, the 7 per cent slide in US gasoline futures this week was a significant factor behind the drop in crude prices.“Crude prices are being driven by the tightness in refinery capacity; it has little to do with the supply in oil,” he said.Growing US dependence on foreign oil was underlined this week with oil imports of 10.9m barrels a day, the third-largest import figure in history.The week also saw another oil company raise its long-term price target. Statoil, the Norwegian state-controlled oil producer, raised its planning price assumption to $25-$30 a barrel from $22, after it bought Gulf of Mexico assets of EnCana of Canada."
130;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-04-29T20:48:27Z;Volatile trading leaves investors in a spin;;Wall Street indices took bulls and bears alike on a roller-coaster ride this week, whipsawing amid indecision about the outlook for profits, the economy and crude oil.By the close on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 per cent at 10,192.51 as the S&P 500 index inched up 1.1 per cent to 1,156.85. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.9 per cent to 1,921.56.The Dow gained 0.3 per cent while the S&P 500 advanced 0.4 per cent for the week and the Nasdaq gave up 0.5 per cent.The earnings season continued, with a stream of economic data adding to a mixed backdrop. News of declining consumer confidence was countered by tumbling oil prices as increased consumer incomes and spending failed to spur optimism amid inconclusive earnings reports.The week started with yet more mergers, when several deals were announced Monday. Valero Energy saw shares add 1.1 per cent for the session when the company announced it would take over Premcor, another refiner, for about $8bn. Shares in Premcor gained 18.1 per cent. For the week, Valero was down 8.7 per cent, while Premcor added 12.1 per cent.Not all deals generated trading, as MCI’s indication over the weekend that it preferred a bid from Qwest Communications, rather than one from Verizon, barely moved any of the three stocks for the session. Verizon’s quarterly earnings, however, did push its stock 3.6 per cent higher two days later. MCI eased 0.6 per cent this week. Qwest lost 3.7 per cent, and Verizon put on 5.1 per cent.The buyout of DoubleClick, the internet advertising company, by a private equity group, was another deal announced on Monday. Shares in DoubleClick gave up 5.3 per cent after the transaction was announced and were down 6.2 per cent for the week.Concerns about the availability of finance for some leveraged buyouts weighed on the stocks of target companies later in the week, with SunGard Data Systems losing 1.7 per cent to $33.38 on Thursday and finishing the week 1.8 per cent off. SunGard, DoubleClick and Toys R Us all traded below the price at which the offers had been made.In a similar theme, worries about the takeover of Archipelago Holdings by the New York Stock Exchange sent shares in the electronic market operator down 8.4 per cent on Monday. However, the stock rebounded later in the week as those fears abated and was up 9.2 per cent on the week by Friday’s close.During a week that was supposed to be about the maiden flight of the Airbus superjumbo airliner, Boeing captured much of the attention with two multi-billion dollar orders for its Dreamliner jet and orther planes, in addition to its earnings report. Having jumped 2.9 per cent on Monday and 1.1 per cent two sessions later, Boeing shares finished the week 2.8 per cent higher.Worries about consumers’ appetite for new technology and other products were fanned by a below-estimate earnings report from Lexmark and a worrying guidance from Amazon. The printer maker saw shares tumble 14 per cent on Tuesday, dragging rival Hewlett-Packard’s shares 3 per cent lower, while Amazon stock gave up 3 per cent. On the week, Amazon eased 2.1 per cent as Lexmark fell 8.5 per cent.KLA-Tencor, the semiconductor equipment maker, fanned worries about the outlook for technology as it warned that its clients’ slowing expansion plans would impact its earnings. Shares fell 2.7 per cent on Friday and lost 5.1 per cent for the five-session stretch.However, Microsoft saw shares put on 3.5 per cent on Friday as its upbeat guidance cancelled out news that it failed to meet earnings expectations for the previous quarter. For the week, the stock was 1.3 per cent up.Elsewhere, shares in Starbucks, the coffee-house chain operator, rose 4.6 per cent on Thursday and were 8.7 per cent higher for the week by Friday’s close.
131;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-04-25T20:39:57Z;Market Overview: Wall Street leads stocks higher;;After the violent swings and shifts of last week, a firmer tone was seen in world equity markets on Monday.Wall Street continued its outperformance against other regional markets, posting solid gains on the back of further positive corporate earnings results, strong housing sales data and more takeover activity.In Europe, markets made more modest headway amid poor business confidence data in Germany. Asian markets, similarly, moved cautiously higher.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index closed 0.8 per cent higher at 10.242.47, meaning it had rebounded roughly 2.5 per cent from an intraday low of 10,000.46 on April 20. The S&P 500 also gained 0.8 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite closed up 1 per cent.Boosting the US market was news that Valero Energy had agreed to buy refining rival Premcor for $6.9bn.There was also support from a firmer Apple share price after a broker upgrade from Credit Suisse First Boston and stronger-than-expected housing sales figures for March.Citigroup suggested the old stock market adage “sell in May and go away” might not prove to be an astute move this year.“We expect the market to rebound in the second and third quarters,” said Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup strategist.He added that Citigroup had reviewed the past 55 years of stock market trading patterns and found that when the first quarter had been down, there was no clear tendency for share prices to either rebound or fall further in the May-October period. “‘Sell in May and go away’ has not been terribly useful when the stock market has experienced a weak first-quarter performance,” he said.Less bullish on the markets was Goldman Sachs. The investment bank forecast equity markets were likely to be “fairly directionless” for the remainder of the year in the face of “macro uncertainty”. “This stage of recovery after a structural bear market is typically characterised by markets trading in a broad range,” its strategy team said. Goldman Sachs said it favoured the view that economic growth was only in a “soft spot”.“We do not believe the recent weakness in US data reflects the start of a significant downward trend. In our view, the current slowdown is due to one-off factors – and the key foundation of strong US spending, the housing market, is showing few signs of giving way,” it said.“However, the risks increase further out as current levels of spending look unsustainable.”Goldman Sachs said investors were likely to become very sensitive to the momentum of economic growth.That view appeared to hold true in Europe yesterday after the Munich-based Ifo institute said its index of German business confidence hit a 19-month low in April after falling for a third straight month. The poor showing was widely seen as providing further evidence that Europe’s economy was slowing. In response, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index underperformed Wall Street, rising 0.4 per cent to 1,077.05. The Xetra Dax index in Germany climbed 0.6 per cent to 4,246.96.In the currency markets, the yen leapt to a two-month high against the euro and a one-month high against the dollar as speculation intensified that China might soon revalue its currency.Oil prices rallied for the fifth trading session in row, rising past the $55-a-barrel mark in intraday trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
132;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-04-25T20:34:19Z;Merger and earnings news boosts Wall St;;A merger in the energy sector and upbeat earnings news gave Wall Street stocks a boost on Monday after a volatile previous week.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 rose 0.8 per cent to 10,242.47 and 1,162.10, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 1,150.78.Multiple merger announcements helped lift sentiment, while crude prices, which rebounded to more than $55 per barrel in intraday trade, failed to dent the gains.Marc Pado, US markets analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, warned investors not to “expect any clarity” following an extremely volatile stretch last week. He said the jittery mood could make for a very slow summer period in the market.Ken Tower, chief analyst at CyberTrader, said last week was “likely to be a bottom” but cautioned that “the bulls still have a lot of work to establish an up trend”.In corporate news, shares of Valero Energy rose 1.1 per cent to $75.87 after the company said it would take over Premcor for $8bn. Shares in Premcor gained 18.1 per cent to $69.70.MCI shares eased 0.1 per cent to $26.67 after the company indicated a preference for the latest bid from Qwest Communications over one from Verizon Communications. Qwest and Verizon were both virtually unchanged at $3.55 and $34.06, respectively.Also in the telecommunications sector, SBC Communications shares gained 0.5 per cent to $23.32 after the carrier reported lower quarterly earnings but exceeded operating profit estimates.Among financial-related stocks, Archipelago Holdings stock shares fell 8.4 per cent to $27.25 amid signs at the weekend that its merger with the New York Stock Exchange faced opposition.In other deal news, DoubleClick shares fell 5.3 per cent to $8.12 after the internet advertising company said it agreed to be taken over by Hellman & Friedman, a private equity group.In the retail sector, OfficeMax shares added 1.1 per cent to $32.82 after the retailer of office equipment settled a proxy fight with K Capital, a private equity firm. Staples and Office Depot, two rivals, were up 1.8 per cent at $19.84 and 0.7 per cent at $20.45, respectively.Among Dow components, Boeing shares rose 2.9 per cent to $59.58 after the aerospace group announced a $6bn commercial jetliner deal with Air Canada. Boeing has been lagging behind Europe’s Airbus in orders for commercial jets.Other companies reporting earnings included Kimberly-Clark, the toilet tissue and paper group, whose shares edged off 0.5 per cent to $63.24 after the company reported in-line quarterly profits and issued a cautious guidance.Reebok International, the athletic footwear company, saw shares gain 1.5 per cent to $42.64 after it reported a 11 per cent increase in sales last quarter. Nike, its rival, put on 0.7 per cent to $78.33.
133;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-04-25T07:17:17Z;Valero makes $8bn swoop for Premcor;;Valero Energy on Monday unveiled an $8bn acquisition of rival Premcor to become the biggest oil refiner in north America. The deal brings Valero total assets of $25bn and annual revenues of nearly $70bn, thrusting it up to number 15 on the Fortune 500 ranking system.But, more importantly for shareholders in a period of high prices amid rising demand, it gives Valero 19 refineries with a total throughput refining capacity of 3.3m barrels per day.“Clearly, the refining industry has entered a new era,” said Bill Greehey, Valero chairman and chief executive. “We are acquiring several very strategic refineries for significantly less than their combined replacement value, and we'll be improving the profitability of these plants by capturing synergies, improving their reliability and yield and increasing their capacities.”Jay Saunders of Deutsche Bank said the deal enhanced Valero's strategy, building the size and quality of its holdings. But he noted significant risk on the price and timing, observing Valero could be buying within a year away from the top of the market.Valero will pay $3.4bn in cash and $3.5bn in shares. It will assume debt of $1.8bn, partly offset by $800m in cash held by Premcor. The price equates to $72.76 in cash for each Premcor share, a 20 per cent premium on recently traded levels and nearly 25 per cent over Friday's close.The cash portion will be funded in part by debt. That portion is expected to be about $1.4bn. The rest will come from cash in hand.Standard & Poor's immediately lowered its corporate credit rating on Valero to BBB-, from BBB, and placed the rating on CreditWatch with negative implications, meaning it believes it more likely Valero's ratings will go down than up.John Thieroff, S&P credit analyst, said he was concerned “refining margins could weaken considerably in advance of the close, jeopardising Valero's plans for rapid deleveraging”.Valero defended the price paid, noting the deal was expected to bring synergies of $350m a year in the second year after closing, expected at the end of 2005, and is forecast to be 14 per cent accretive to earnings per share in the first year. The acquisition not only raises the throughput of Valero but also positions the company to raise the proportion of sour crude that it processes. Sour crude sells at a heavy discount to light sweet crude and requires different processing.Traditionally, there has been a shortage of sour crude refining capacity in north America. But the surge in oil demand in the past two years has brought more on to the market.No changes were announced to Valero's senior management or board of directors. Thomas O'Malley, Premcor's chairman and holder of more than 1m Premcor shares, said he intended to remain a long-term and large shareholder of Valero.“This transaction creates the number one investment vehicle in the very attractive US refining sector,” he said.
134;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-04-22T20:00:28Z;Crude resumes climb amid refinery glitches;;Crude prices rose more than 6 per cent this week after a number of refining glitches in the US, which provoked concerns about building gasoline stockpiles ahead of the summer driving season.The refinery woes highlight the market’s fragility and underlines the tightness in US and global refining capacity. Like crude production, the refining market is operating on the thinnest cushion of spare capacity in several decades.Nervousness over US refining capacity helped push US gasoline futures up about 11 per cent on the week, the highest weekly gain in about 18 months, and stopped any chance of crude falling below $50 a barrel in the short term.The concern on refinery bottlenecks was reawakened with the explosion last month at BP’s Texas City refinery. Since then, a number of US refineries have announced unplanned maintenance programmes on fears that continued high utilisation rates could create a danger of overworking plans and thereby increasing the danger of breakdowns.Last year’s increase of 2.6m barrels a day in global oil demand overshadowed the modest rise of 700,000 b/d in global refining capacity in 2004. This gave refiners their best margins in decades as gasoline and heating oil prices reached new highs, although these peaks have been surpassed this year.The International Energy Agency, a watchdog for industrialised countries, sees a repeat of the pattern this year, with 2005 global oil demand increasing by 1.8m b/d, and refining capacity by 1m b/d.Again, US refiners are enjoying their best margins, with refiners making $14 on each barrel of gasoline they produce. This compares with the 1990s, when most refiners suffered losses and hence neglected to invest in new capacity.High refiner margins were illustrated this week with leading US independent refiner Valero Energy reporting a doubling in first quarter net income to a hefty $534m.Oil companies are slowly responding to tightness by increasing investment in downstream businesses. Total, the French oil producer, is increasing its downstream investments by 50 per cent this year. Jeroen van der Veer, chief executive of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said this week that his company planned to increase its refinery capacity so its refiners could process more heavy grades of oil, the type of oil produced by many oil exporters from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Tony Haward, chief executive officer of exploration and production at BP, said his company would increase US refinery capacity to take into account heavy oils from Canada. However, increased spending by BP and Shell on refineries will be small beside their spending on exploring for and developing new oil projects.Concerns about tighter capacity has pushed US gasoline futures up more than 50 per cent so far this year, with the May Nymex unleaded gasoline contract trading at $1.652 a gallon, up 3.2 cents on the day. US heating oil prices have also benefited, with the May contract up 25 per cent so far this year at $1.55 a gallon. Even though demand for heating oil in the US is now falling due to the warmer weather, the Nymex heating oil contract is also a proxy for diesel and jet fuel demand, which are both rising firmly.In London, the gasoil contract, which is a proxy for diesel and fuel oil traded on the International Petroleum Exchange is up 33 per cent so far this year.The rise in product prices has led gains in crude futures this year. IPE Brent crude futures for June delivery were $1.17 higher at $55.17 a barrel in late afternoon trade, up more than 7 per cent on the week and about 35 per cent for the year to date.June Nymex WTI gained $1.19 to $55.39 a barrel in New York on Friday, up more than 8 per cent for the week – almost 30 per cent since the new year.
135;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-04-19T19:45:52Z;Oil recovers amid refinery problems;;Crude oil futures rebounded strongly on Tuesday after a series of refinery problems in the US and in the UK sent US petroleum product prices higher, which in turn fuelled higher crude prices.US refineries operated by ExxonMobil and Valero have been shut for unplanned maintenance in recent days. This made the market nervous as refineries ramped up production early ahead of the expected lift in gasoline demand for the summer driving season.An announcement that ConocoPhilips plans to shut its 234,000 barrels a day Humber refinery in May also added to bullish sentiment for gasoline prices.IPE Brent for June delivery added $2.16 to $52.94 a barrel by the close of London trade, but remained almost $5 below its peak of $57.65 reached on April 4.May Nymex WTI gained $1.92 to $52.29 a barrel in New York trade. With the May contract expiring at the close of trade today, more volume was seen in the June contract, which rose $1.58 to $53.05. Nymex gasoline advanced 4.66 cents to $1.5410 a gallon, and May Nymex heating oil added 3.47 cents to $1.4770 a gallon.“I think we are entering a period where oil prices are going to remain in a range,” said Graham Sharp, head of energy trading at Trafigura, the commodities trader.The rises came ahead of today’s release of the US weekly crude inventory report, which is expected to show another rise in stockpiles. US crude inventories are already at their highest level since June 2002. A preliminary Reuters survey of nine analysts forecast inventories would rise by another 1.8m barrels in the week to April 15, a 200,000 barrels rise in gasoline stocks and an increase of 400,000 barrels in distillate fuels, which include heating oil and diesel.Gold had a sharp jump, hitting a four-week high of $433.10 a troy ounce, before settling at $432.60/$433.35 a troy ounce, up from the late quote of $426.90/$427.70 a troy ounce in New York on Monday.Silver prices were pulled higher by gold’s advance. The precious metal was quoted at $7.21/$7.24 a troy ounce, up 20 cents from the late quote in the previous session.The International Copper Study Group (ICSG) said yesterday that it was raising its production capacity forecasts out to 2008 due to current high prices and demand growth expectations.ICSG said annual mine capacity in 2008 was now projected to increase to 19m tonnes, an increase of about 3.2m tonnes from 2004. It said the total projected compound annual growth rate over the period would be 4.7 per cent.Copper prices added $45 to $3,237 a tonne at the close of open outcry trading on the London Metal Exchange.

The S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 1,182.34, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 1,996.99.Stocks rallied briefly at the start of trading as oil prices fell, giving hope to bullish investors frustrated by sliding share prices on Friday. Those gains soon gave way, but shares later rallied again, leaving bulls and bears locked in a stalemate two hours before the closing bell.Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services, said the performance indicated that investors were taking a “wait-and-see” approach ahead of several big corporate earnings reports and economic data due out later this week.Carmakers were among the biggest losers of the day as investors digested a profits warning from Ford Motor. Ford shares fell 5.4 per cent to $10.44 after the company lowered its full-year outlook. William Ford Jr, its chief executive, said on Friday that he expected the company’s automobile unit to “break even at best” this year. The news sparked a series of downgrades from investment banks. General Motors, Ford’s biggest rival, whose shares were hit when it issued a profits warning earlier this year, fell 1.9 per cent to $28.94.Another big loser was Bemis, the maker of plastic packaging. It fell 7.3 per cent to $28.70 after the company said that higher raw materials costs led to lower profits in the first quarter.Energy groups were also lower after oil prices fell. Valero Energy, the oil refiner, fell 2 per cent to $75.67. Devon Energy, the oil and gas explorer, rose 0.3 per cent to $47.03.The battle for MCI continued. MCI’s shares rose 0.4 per cent to $25.95 a day after Verizon Communications, the biggest US telecoms operator, bought 13 per cent of the company from Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire.

137;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-04-04T20:20:42Z;Wall Street ends higher as crude eases;;A mid-afternoon fall-off in oil prices and rallying shares in AIG, the insurance group, propelled US stocks back into positive territory on Monday following two days of declines.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 10,421.14. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 1,176.12 and 1,991.07, respectively.Oil price briefly shot past $58 for the first time. But the surge later abated, giving a boost to bullish investors frustrated at the stock market’s recent dithering.American International Group, the insurance company, fuelled the burgeoning rally after Eliot Spitzer, the New York State attorney general, said a civil resolution to his office’s investigation into the company was achievable. AIG shares closed 4.6 per cent higher at $53.30.Earlier, Martin Sullivan, the company’s newly appointed CEO, sought to reassure investors about the government’s probe into industry practices. He told shareholders AIG was “committed to improving transparency and corporate governance, and we want to have an open and constructive dialogue with our regulators”.Energy companies among the were the biggest gainers in spite of the afternoon pullback in crude prices. Unocal was the centre of attention in the sector after it agreed to a $16.4bn takeover by ChevronTexaco. Unocal’s shares fell 7.4 per cent to $59.60 as hopes of a counterbid faded. ChevronTexaco shares fell 3.9 per cent to $56.98.Valero Energy lost 1.4 per cent to $76.65, pulling back from all-time highs of last week. Other energy groups were higher. XTO Energy, the oil and gas producer, rose 2.1 per cent to $35.33 after its president and co-founder, Steffen Palko, said he would step down at the end of the month. XTO’s shares have gained more than 36 per cent this year.Some influential voices have begun to caution that energy stocks’ bull run could be short-lived, however. Smith Barney yesterday downgraded the energy sector to “market weight”, saying it had noted “a tectonic shift in investor sentiment over the past year from speculative scoffing about higher oil prices to strong conviction that they will never back off”.Elsewhere, Aon, the world’s second biggest insurance broker, rose 0.3 per cent to $22.60 after naming a new chief executive.JPMorgan Chase, the investment bank, fell 0.4 per cent to $33.77 after a Merrill Lynch analyst trimmed earnings estimates.

138;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2005-02-22T21:38:38Z;Wall St slides as oil moves back over $50;;Wall Street suffered its biggest single-day decline of the year on Tuesday, after investor jitters over the rising price of oil and a sharp fall in the dollar sparked a sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6 per cent to 10,611.13, and the S&P 500 lost 1.5 per cent 1,184.22 - the biggest single-day fall for both indices since August last year. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.4 per cent to 2,030.32.The fall extended the market’s losses from last week, which saw US stocks retreat from year-highs.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said that, in spite of recent dithering, strong corporate profit growth in the fourth quarter and improving expectations for the first quarter meant that stocks were still looking cheap. “Valuations in the market today are no different than they were at the bottom of the market in late 2002 and early 2003,” he said.But Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach, said continued earnings strength was far from certain. “A lot depends on where interest rates will be six months from now,” he said, adding that the market would remain sensitive to signs of rising inflation.Pharmaceutical companies took a beating following Monday’s news that Novartis, the Swiss drugmaker, had paid $8bn to snap up Germany’s second-biggest generic drugs group. Merck and Pfizer, two of the biggest US drugmakers, fell 4.3 per cent to $31.20 and 0.8 per cent to $26.59, respectively.Big-name pharma groups have come under pressure from generic competition in recent years. That pressure is expected to mount as patents expire on a raft of name-brand drugs.Energy stocks were among the rare gainers on the S&P 500 yesterday as the price of oil climbed following the cold snap that settled across much of the northern US and Europe at the weekend. Valero Energy, the oil refiner, jumped 1.8 per cent to $66.44.

The S&P 500 slipped 0.8 per cent to 1,201.79 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,151.94.Bulls continued to be frustrated at the lack of a traditional post-Christmas bounce, which eluded investors as the stock market sputtered in the last trading sessions of 2004.US stocks remain near 3½-year highs, in spite of their lacklustre year-end run. And, although the rate of economic growth is expected to moderate this year as the effects of interest rate rises take hold and inflationary pressure mounts, many analysts expect the market to continue its forward momentum into early 2005.Anirvan Banerji, director of research at the Economic Cycle Research Institute, said: ""We have an ongoing global industrial slowdown, but the outlook is fairly resilient.""Mr Banerji said that, in spite of uncertainties about the US twin deficits and the weakening dollar, ""for the time being we are likely to see global expansion"".A mixed bag of economic news greeted investors on Monday, with one report showing rising orders and declining employment at US factories. Separate figures showed that construction spending slowed in November, confounding expectations of a modest rise.Early attention fell on Merck, the embattled drugs group, which was forced to withdraw its painkiller Vioxx from the market in November because of health concerns. Merck shares slipped 2.8 per cent to $31.25 after the Financial Times reported that research on Vioxx may be published in a medical journal.Pfizer, whose Celebrex painkiller is part of the same drug class as Vioxx, fell 1.6 per cent to $26.45.Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, rose 1.1 per cent to $53.40 after it raised its December sales outlook.

140;VLO;Valero Energy Corp;2004-10-26T23:38:51Z;Volcker’s role in Iraqi food-for-oil programme questioned;;A senior US congressman on Tuesday questioned the ability of Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, to conduct an independent probe into the United Nations' controversial Iraqi oil-for-food programme.Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who heads the House energy committee, said there were conflicts of interest in the probe chaired by Mr Volcker, and that elements in UN want the issue “to go away”.“It's really difficult for Mr Volcker to do an independent hard-hitting investigation when his portfolio comes from the very [sources] that he needs to investigate,” Mr Barton said, following a roundtable meeting with energy executives in Houston.The comments could inflame existing tensions between the various probes into the oil-for-food scheme, by which the previous Iraqi administration was able to export oil in exchange for food and medicine.Mr Barton heads one of the four congressional committees investigating the matter, along with the Justice Department and New York law enforcement agencies.Mr Barton said there was evidence that oil companies agreed to pay a 10 per cent surcharge on exports in the last two or three years of the scheme, which ran from 1996-2003, allowing the regime to “skim $10bn”. He said the funds may have allowed Saddam Hussein to stay in power.A number of US oil companies including ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, El Paso and Valero are already being questioned about their role in the programme.“We're looking comprehensively” at participants in the programme, he said. “But the Duelfer report points out that 70 per cent of these allocations went to sitting members of the [UN] Security Council France, Russia and China.”Mr Volcker has said a congressional probe could create problems for the existing investigations. “We cannot let them get access to data for a fishing expedition to make a political issue,” he told Il Sole 24, the Italian newspaper.Mr Barton said he had already written to the UN and this week to Jacques Chirac, the French president, seeking co-operation, though had yet to receive a reply from either.The congressman said the US has also signed a memorandum of understanding with officials of the interim Iraqi administration to secure access to documents and individuals involved in the programme.Mr Barton visited Iraq six weeks ago and said he was told the authorities held two complete sets of documents detailing sales under the programme. He added that the UN also held a set, though he was unsure if it was complete and if he would be granted access to the documents.
