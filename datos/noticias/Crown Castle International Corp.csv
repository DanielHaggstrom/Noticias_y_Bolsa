It expects the deal to close by the end of 2017, pending regulatory approvals.Once the deal closes, Crown said it will own or have rights to about 60,000 route miles of fibre.Crown chief executive Jay Brown said:“We are excited about the addition of Lightower given its attractive fibre footprint and the value we believe it will create for our shareholders. Lightower’s dense fibre footprint is well-located in top metro markets in the Northeast and is well-positioned to facilitate small cell deployments by our customers.”

European telecom companies need capital for network investment. As bond yields fall in Europe, meanwhile, investors’ need for alternative sources of income grows acute. So the former should sell their infrastructure, and lease it back. Done and done.This has long been a popular idea in the US. Companies such as American Tower and Crown Castle — both tax-advantaged real estate investment trusts — own towers and rent space on them for antennas. Given long-term contracts with carriers, the scarcity of towers, and low maintenance capital needs, they can carry lots of debt. Both companies have net debt exceeding their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by five times. As Reits, they must return most of their profits to investors. Investors are happy with the structure: they both trade at price to earnings ratios above 40, leaving their dividend yields well below 2 per cent.Tower business exists in Europe, too. In February, Italy’s EI Towers bid for rival Milan-listed Rai Way, owned by the Italian broadcaster Rai. The latter insisted on maintaining majority control of its towers. Last week, EI appeared to consent to buying a minority stake. Both companies trade at lower valuations than their US equivalents — partly because they lack the tax advantages of Reits and due to their much smaller size. Their price to earnings multiples are in the 30s.There could soon be more traded Europeans in the industry. Abertis, the Spanish infrastructure company, plans to spin off a majority stake in its own telecom asset business as Spanish-listed Cellnex Telecom. Assuming valuation multiples similar to EI or Rai Way, it could be worth €3-4bn.The fact that the Europeans need not pay out the bulk of earnings may be an advantage — providing more flexibility to invest when opportunities appear, and making them less sensitive to swings in interest rates. That discount to US peers looks attractive.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
2;CCI;Crown Castle International Corp;2012-09-28T17:13:48Z;T-Mobile USA sells tower rights for $2.4bn;Crown Castle becomes largest US operator of towers;T-Mobile USA, the fourth-largest US mobile operator by subscribers, has reached an agreement to sell the rights to lease and operate its 7,200 cellular towers to Crown Castle International for $2.4bn in cash.Under the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, Crown Castle will acquire the exclusive right to lease and operate the towers for about 28 years with an option to purchase the towers at the end of the period for another $2.4bn.The deal will consolidate Crown Castle’s position as the largest US cell tower operator, with 30,000 sites across the country, while the sale proceeds will help fund T-Mobile’s construction of a 4G network based on LTE technology to support high-speed mobile data services.John Legere, who was named as T-Mobile USA’s new chief executive last week, welcomed the deal, which he said “will support our ongoing $4bn network modernisation initiative”.T-Mobile USA, which is owned by Deutsche Telekom, first announced plans to sell its towers 18 months ago, but those plans were jettisoned when AT&T bid $39bn for the company. The towers were put back on the auction block after the AT&T deal was blocked by regulators and T-Mobile USA was forced to come up with a strategy to compete with its larger rivals on its own.As part of that strategy, T-Mobile USA is using the $3bn break-up fee it received from AT&T after the deal fell apart to build its own LTE network in order to compete with Verizon Wireless, AT&T Mobility and Sprint Nextel, which have already launched LTE services.T-Mobile USA has struggled to compete with its larger rivals and has been losing valuable monthly contract subscribers because it is the only one of the big four US mobile operators which does not offer Apple’s popular iPhone handsets and because it has lagged behind in launching LTE services.Deutsche Telekom has yet to reveal its longer term strategy for the US mobile unit, but has made it clear that the company will have to fund its own capital investment projects in the future.Ben Moreland, Crown Castle’s chief executive, said: “Our agreement with T-Mobile strengthens our position as the largest provider of shared wireless infrastructure in the US, which we believe is the largest, fastest growing and most profitable wireless market in the world.” He said that 83 per cent of the T-Mobile USA towers are in the top 100 US metropolitan markets and will fit in well with Crown Castle’s strategy of focusing on these markets.
3;CCI;Crown Castle International Corp;2011-12-20T23:53:03Z;T-Mobile could sell towers to fund investment;;A month before AT&T announced it would pay $39bn for Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit, the chief executives of the German company and its American subsidiary outlined a survival plan for the fourth-largest US mobile network.René Obermann, Deutsche Telekom’s chief executive, told analysts and reporters in New York in February that T-Mobile USA might sell its extensive network of 7,000 mobile phone towers to help fund investment in a new 4G network based on LTE technology. Such a transaction, which analysts estimated might net about $2bn, could be back on the front burner now that AT&T’s bid has been formally abandoned.Analysts say the most likely potential buyers for T-Mobile’s tower network, then as now, are American Tower or Crown Castle, although neither company has publicly expressed any interest in such a transaction.In recent years, several of the main US wireless operators have sold some or all of their towers, often leasing them back as required. For example, Sprint Nextel sold about 3,000 towers for $670m in 2008.While the sale of the mobile phone network would not cover the full costs of building the LTE network that T-Mobile USA needs to compete with its rivals, it could provide funds that the company could use to gain the wireless spectrum it must acquire before it can begin to contemplate rolling out new broadband wireless data services.Crucially, as Mr Obermann noted in February, the sale of the tower network could reduce T-Mobile USA’s reliance on Deutsche Telekom to fund its future development, enabling the German group to refocus its capital investment in Europe.Mr Obermann said then that T-Mobile USA would sell the assets only if they fetch a good price. “We are definitely not in a rush,” he said, adding that a sale would depend on whether “the financials work out”.
4;CCI;Crown Castle International Corp;2009-04-22T17:32:30Z;Clever wheezes do not mend banks;;"So, what do all the $12.7bn (€9.8bn, £8.7bn), and counting, in first-quarter profits from what used to be known as Wall Street add up to? Have the past two years been one giant head fake, despite what we have been led to believe? Is the global meltdown we have been subsidising with trillions of taxpayer dollars over? Is the investment bank back?Not so fast. While global banking activity has picked up considerably since the financial ice age that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers – the nadir was September 29, the day the US Congress failed to pass the first version of the troubled asset relief programme and the market plunged 778 points – the thaw has been aided and abetted by some very clever schemes.First was the decision by the Federal Accounting Standards Board on April 2 to modify what many bankers considered the FASB’s onerous mark-to-market rules forc­ing securities firms to write down the value of their assets as they lost value in the in­creasingly illiquid market. (Seems like a reasonable idea to value assets at what they are really worth, no?) The FASB had been reviewing this change and received much commentary from the financial community “that asserted that fair value is not as relevant when financial markets are inactive or ­distressed”.In other words, the rules were killing the banks’ balance sheets. A stroke of the pen could fix that. FASB’s decision – which allowed financial institutions to re-mark upwards the value of their portfolios of troubled assets– was retroactive to March 15, two weeks before the end of the first quarter of 2009.Then a steady stream of first-quarter bank profits came in. On April 9, with very few specifics, Wells Fargo announced it had made $3bn in the first quarter . Goldman Sachs later pre-announced it had made $1.8bn. Then JPMorgan Chase said it had made $2.1bn. Citigroup, the biggest of the zombie banks, reported profits of $1.6bn. Bank of America logged profits of $4.25bn, while also conceding that nearly half the profit came from a mark-to-market gain at Merrill Lynch.FASB does not get all the credit for helping to manufacture these ­profits, but it surely gets some of it. “We are an independent standard-setter and it’s important that we maintain our independence,” FASB board member Lawrence Smith told the Wall Street Journal, “[but the board can’t] ignore what’s going on around us” – a clear nod at the plaintive pleas from banks.(What all this marking up of toxic assets on the banks’ books will mean for the US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner’s plan to encourage trading in these assets is another ­matter.)The Federal Reserve has also been listening carefully to the banks’ pleas. It has lowered the cost of money it charges banks – and since all the big Wall Street securities firms are either gone or have become banks, this means virtually everyone – to close to zero. As one of the two largest costs a bank incurs is what it pays for money – the other being compensation, which has also been greatly reduced – it is not surprising the big banks found a way to make profits when their raw material costs shrank. Airlines could make money too, if jet fuel were free.Then there is the sleight of hand, at least in the case of Goldman Sachs, which, when it converted from a securities firm to a bank holding company last autumn, changed its fiscal year-end to December 31 from November 30. Its first-quarter numbers, for the three months ended March 31 2009, did not include its horrific December results – into which Goldman threw everything but the kitchen sink – of a loss of more than $1bn. During the past seven months – including December (there was Christmas, right?) – Goldman in fact lost $1.5bn.The problem with artificial stimuli and technicalities is not only that they do nothing to help capital markets recover in an honest way, but also that they mask what has been a trickle of genuine activity in the past few weeks. There were signs of life in mergers and acquisitions, with some $27bn of deals announced on Monday. Last week the long-dormant junk bond market saw $4bn of new issuance – from the likes of such leveraged credits as HCA, Crown Castle International and Seagate Technology. There were two initial public offerings as well; Rosetta Stone, a language software company, rose nearly 40 per cent on its first day of trading. Also, JPMorgan Chase, took the unusual step – for the first time in eight months – of issuing $3bn of 10-year bonds without the guarantee of the FDIC. Goldman made a similar move on January 29, when it sold $2bn of debt without government backing.A true return of profitability on Wall Street will come with the return of public confidence in the way it does business. Concepts such as honesty and transparency are key, not a bunch of accounting gimmicks designed to manufacture profits and send markets soaring. The public will remain sceptical of the recovery – and the return of the investment banks – until then.The writer is a contributing editor at Fortune and is the author of ‘House of Cards: a Tale of Hubris and Wretched Excess on Wall Street’"
5;CCI;Crown Castle International Corp;2006-01-23T23:26:28Z;Alliance formed to promote mobile TV;;Nokia, Intel, Motorola and other wireless equipment makers have formed an alliance to promote an emerging technology standard for delivering live TV to mobile phones.The partners said they would work together to develop and spread the use of DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting-Handheld) – an open standard for broadcasting TV on wireless equipment – through a group dubbed the Mobile DTV Alliance.Texas Instruments and Crown Castle International, the US cell tower operator that is building a DVB-H network in the US, are also members of the alliance.The formation of the alliance represents a serious challenge for Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chip maker, that is backing a rival proprietary technology called Media Flow.DVB-H and Media Flow technologies will enable mobile carriers to provide video content to subscribers without overloading their 3G wireless networks.Mobile operators and video content providers in the US and elsewhere hope that delivering mobile TV and other video content to mobile phones will provide them with a new revenue stream. In the US, Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel, which operate 3G networks based on Qualcomm’s CDMA technology, are expected to adopt Media Flow. Mobile carriers in Australia,Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and UShave been testing DVB-H technology.
