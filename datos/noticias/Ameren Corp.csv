——————————————————————————————————–GDF SUEZ Energy North America (GSENA) is actively seeking to acquire an unregulated power plant portfolio and has a specific asset package in PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland power pool) on its radar, a source with knowledge of the situation told mergermarket.The company has not approached the target, the source said, declining to disclose the identity of the asset package.One logical target is Edison Mission Energy (EME), the IPP (independent power producers) subsidiary of Edison Mission Group (EMG), which manages Edison International’s power generation business and other unregulated subsidiaries. It owns or leases interests in 44 power plants, with an aggregate capacity of 11,344 MW, of which EMG’s ownership share is 10,441 MW.EME has a significant amount of coal in its portfolio, which GDF finds unattractive, but it does have a presence in PJM, the source said. It also has renewable energy, which could serve as a “sweetener” for a deal, he said.EME subsidiary Midwest Generation has six plants in Illinois and most of their output is sold into PJM, according to Edison’s web site. On the renewables side, it has a biomass facility in New York and one of the largest portfolios of wind energy projects in the US, also according to the site.This news service recently reported that Ameren Corporation, a St. Louis, Missouri-based utility holding company, could try once again to sell its approximately 5,000 MW non-regulated power plant portfolio. The company had retained Goldman Sachs last year as its financial advisor on the sales process, but pulled it off the market due to pricing issues, the report said.The source said GSENA did not participate in Ameren’s auction due to its amount of coal. When asked about Dynegy, he dismissed it as a target as well, as it too has coal.Most recently, GSENA was involved in the auction for Conectiv, the source said, declining further comment on the matter. Pepco ended up selling Conectiv (3,860 MW) to Calpine on 21 April for USD 1.7bn.An industry banker said it would make sense for GSENA to take a look at BostonGen’s generation fleet, which is the third largest in New England, serving the Boston metropolitan area. It has 2,942 MW of merchant generation capacity and approximately 80% of its fleet is comprised of natural gas-fired, combined-cycle generating plants.This news service reported on 12 May that BostonGen was receiving indicative bids and it was set to draw up a shortlist. The report said Consellation Energy and First Reserve were taking a look, and an industry source said Energy Capital Partners is taking a look as well. BostonGen announced on 12 April that its Board of Managers had approved the initiation of a strategic sales process in order to restructure the company.While BostonGen is part of ISO New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont) and not PJM, ISO is a very good, liquid market, said the industry source. PJM and ISO are close geographically so it would make sense for GDF to have an interest in both areas, he said.With regard to the regulatory side, the source with knowledge said GSENA would not consider any such acquisitions as the company lacks a deep penetration into the regulated landscape. However, it would be interested in helping regulated utilities de-risk by acquiring their unregulated arms, he said. He added that any transaction would have to be immediately accretive to earnings rather than in two to three years.GSENA is a division of GDF SUEZ Energy Europe & International, which is the energy business of GDF SUEZ. It has 23 renewable plants, 60 power, cogeneration, steam and chilled water facilities and more than 7,000 MW of electric generation capacity. It serves 20% of New England’s annual natural gas demand.——————————————————————————————————–For more information or to inquire about a trial please email sales@mergermarket.com or call EMEA: + 44 (0)20 7059 6105 Americas: +1 212 686-5277 Asia-Pacific: +852 2158 9730"
1;AEE;Ameren Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Wall Street rallies on jobs data;;Wall Street stocks hit fresh highs for the year following a shaky start on Thursday, after encouraging data on jobs and a successful Treasury bond auction reassured investors.The US government’s weekly jobless claims report showed 550,000 Americans had filed for their first week of unemployment benefits last week. The figure was down from 570,000 in the previous week and better than economists’ forecasts of 560,000.A strong Treasury auction also relieved concerns about the US deficit.Uncertainty lingered over President Obama’s address to Congress on Wednesday evening, during which he appealed for a bipartisan reform of the healthcare system, but health insurance stocks reacted well.After recent losses, WellPoint rose 2.5 per cent to $54.18, while Unitedhealth Group also gained 2.5 per cent to $29.11.The US president said that under his plan, it would be illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition or cancel coverage due to sickness, and that they would also be required to cover routine check-ups and preventive care.The S&P 500 closed 1 per cent up at its high for the day of 1,044.14, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 9,627.48.After five straight days of gains, the market hit fresh highs since last October. The S&P also hit its high for the year on Wednesday.The technology-focused Nasdaq, which has outperformed the other indices every day this week, climbed 1.2 per cent to 2,084.02.Shuffle Master added to the gains in the tech sector after the company posted second-quarter earnings above expectations. Shares in the company, which makes automatic card shufflers for casinos, gained 9.2 per cent to $8.40.Texas Instruments, the second largest US chipmaker, said it was expecting stronger revenue than it had forecast in July for the third quarter. The shares were 0.6 per cent lower at $25 after early gains.Yahoo rose 4.5 per cent to $15.45 after Bank of America changed its recommendation to “buy” from “neutral”, saying growth in the company’s user traffic continued to outpace growth in the internet as a whole. Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on Time Warner, boosting its shares by 3.7 per cent to $29.51.“The run that we’ve seen in stocks still continues to impress,” said Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global, the financial derivatives brokerage. “The stocks are overbought here but I’ve been saying that for a long time . . . the biggest issue in the end will be about revenue. You can say, well, we beat earnings expectations but are you making money? That’s going to be the big question.”Airlines also lifted the market after an analyst from JPMorgan said demand was “not as bad as feared” and bankruptcies in the sector were unlikely. United Airlines parent UAL led the sector, rising 17.8 per cent to $7.6, while US Airways also climbed 12.3 per cent to $4.02. The market’s early gains, however, were led by the consumer staples index.Procter & Gamble, the company behind brands such as Gillette and Pantene, rose 4.2 per cent to $56.04 after it raised its earnings forecast for 2010 above analyst expectations.General Mills, which owns brand such as Cheerios cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice-cream, said easing commodity inflation meant its fiscal first-quarter earnings were also running ahead of its target. Its shares fell back 0.6 per cent to $60.90 after early gains.But the materials sector continued to weigh on market sentiment, after pushing the indices into negative territory in early trading. Shares in Monsanto, the world’s biggest seed company, slid 5 per cent to $79.30 after the company forecast earnings below estimates. It said trading in its herbicide business had suffered due to oversupply in the market.The utilities index also pushed the market lower, after spending most of the past three weeks in negative territory.Ameren fell 2.8 per cent to $25.35 after the power company said it planned to offer 19m common shares to raise cash for investment in its subsidiaries.
2;AEE;Ameren Corp;2006-11-20T18:33:54Z;James Altucher: Valuations are cheap despite the talk of recession;;“This is ridiculous!” Average Joe is buying stocks and pushing the Dow to all-time highs almost every day. The Nasdaq is at five-year highs. But the guys sipping the latest reds in charity dinners are saying it is ridiculous that the market is going up.“It’s out of control,” one broker told me. “It’s like the bubble again.” There is one thing we know: when someone says “this is ridiculous”, we know there is money to be made.Everybody is angry. They are angry at the market for going up and leaving them behind. They are angry at their fathers for scoffing at their latest money-making ideas. They are angry for the childhood where they were once excited about the prospects in front of them. Anger at the Dow has roots that can only be uncovered in a $400-an-hour therapy session, since certainly the Dow, like your parents, like your first lovers, could not care less that you think they are ridiculous.So why is this market rally ridiculous? First off, supposedly, a recession is coming. I think this is true. Perhaps the housing market has taken its toll, or the double-digit declines in auto manufacturing for the second year running, or the consumer is strapped by all that credit card debt. Who knows? But we are due, and I am ready for it.But what does a recession mean? We know it means this: in every recession except one since the second world war, interest rates have come down. There have been 11 recessions. In six of the 11 recessions, the market went up. In five of the recessions, the market went down. In the past two recessions when the market went down (1973 and 2001), it can be argued the market was at unsustainable price/earnings multiples. That was particularly the case in 2001 when we were coming off an enormous initial public offering bubble – something that has not occurred in this cycle.In fact, valuations are still cheap. With rates at 5 per cent and heading lower, the market can easily justify an average p/e of 20, assuming minimal to no growth. Forward p/e estimates are at about 15 for the S&P 500. So even if analysts are 30 per cent off in the wrong direction, we are still doing fine.Will they be wrong? I think they are wrong, but in the other direction. Take Microsoft, for instance, with a forward p/e estimate of 17 for next year. Microsoft makes almost all of its money from Windows and Office. For the first time since the beginning of the decade, it is planning a big release of these software products, and it has a history of solidly beating estimates. My guess is that right now, Microsoft is trading at 12-13 times next year’s earnings.S&P 500 companies are sitting on more cash per share than they ever were previously and some of that is going to go towards a big computer upgrade. Expect Microsoft, Intel, AMD, Dell, Oracle and others to benefit.But what about home building? Won’t this cause a death spiral? Let us ask Warren Buffett, who just increased his holdings in Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, by 800 per cent from 780,000 shares to 7m shares. He also bought an additional 10m shares in USG, the building products company. And in case we were worried about whether people would have extra cash to throw around, Mr Buffett bought an additional 1.5m shares in Nike this past quarter.If you are nervous about a recession, then I would suggest stocks from the original Dow companies. These are seven companies that have survived every recession of the past century or more and have continued to thrive.For instance, American Tobacco became American Brands, which then became Fortune Brands, the maker of everything from Jim Beam bourbon to golf shoes. It is a key holding of The Vice Fund. The company trades at 10 times cash flows, hands out a 2 per cent dividend every year and has returned 14.4 per cent a year over the past 50 years to its shareholders.And don’t forget about Distilling and Cattle Feeding, now part of Lyondell Chemical. Lyondell gives out a 3.5 per cent dividend and trades at a forward p/e of just 8.5.Also worth a look is National Lead (now called NL Industries). It makes titanium dioxide, the key ingredient of sun screen (think global warming). NL gives off a 4.8 per cent yield and trades at 20 times next year’s earnings.Peoples Energy (in 1896 it was Chicago Gas) has a 5 per cent dividend yield. Laclede Group (formerly Laclede Gas) a yield of 3.9 per cent. And Ameren (formerly Union Electric), a yield of 5.1 per cent.Finally, our old friend General Electric, which, among other things, has just launched the best television show of the fall season, Heroes.james@formulacapital.com
