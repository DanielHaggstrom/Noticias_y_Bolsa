0;CTAS;Cintas Corp;2017-07-21T20:35:23Z;Visa rallies after benefiting from economic tailwinds;Nasdaq snaps its longest winning streak since February 2015;Visa shares were stronger on Friday after the payments network unveiled larger than expected rises to its quarterly profits and revenues, which were bolstered by its purchase of Visa Europe as well as robust growth in payments volume.The California-based company said operating revenue jumped 26 per cent in its fiscal third quarter, which ended in June, to $4.57bn. Net profits rose to $2.06bn, or 86 cents a share, from $412m, or 17 cents a share.Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings per share of 81 cents on revenues of $4.36bn. The shares rose 1.5 per cent to $99.60, extending its year-to-date rise to 27.6 per cent.Profits in the previous year’s quarter were weighed down by several one-time items related to the purchase of Visa Europe, which it closed last June. Excluding those factors, net income would have been up 26 per cent on a year-over-year basis, Visa said.Visa’s upbeat performance was “powered by economic tailwinds in the US and globally”, said Alfred Kelly Jr, chief executive.The gains came as payments volume growth clocked in at 38 per cent to $1.9tn in the three months ending June 30.Cross-border volumes — the result of transactions in which the credit card issuer is located in a different country than the merchant — rose 11 per cent when the Europe operations are included in the previous year’s results.“After a brief period of disappointment with the Visa Europe acquisition, investors finally received the positive revisions they were hoping for this quarter,” said Bill Carcache, an analyst at Nomura.Elsewhere, Cintas was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 after the maker of work uniforms issued full-year fiscal 2018 earnings outlook that topped Wall Street estimates. Shares in the company climbed 9.2 per cent to $138.43.The rally in Cintas and Visa shares accompanied a nearly flat day of trading in US stocks.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were almost unchanged at 2,472.54 and 6,387.75, respectively, with the Nasdaq snapping its longest winning streak since February 2015.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also 0.2 per cent lower at 21,580.07.Meanwhile, shares in Ebay fell 1.5 per cent to $36.61 after the online marketplace issued an earnings outlook that disappointed markets.The San Jose-based company said it expected earnings from continuing operations to range between 30 and 32 cents a share in the current quarter, compared with analysts’ expectations of 33 cents. Its adjusted earnings outlook of 46 to 48 cents missed expectations of 49 cents.Moreover, it lowered its outlook for full-year earnings to $1.65 to $1.75 a share, below its previous projections for EPS in the range of $1.85-$2.10.Alongside the downbeat outlook, the company reported a sharp drop in second-quarter earnings.On a per-share basis, earnings slid 95 per cent to 2 cents from 38 cents in the year-ago period. The results were affected by a $311m charge tied to the realignment of its legal structure.However, adjusting for one-time items, EPS of 45 cents were up 5 per cent and in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenues rose 4 per cent to $2.3bn, in line with estimates.
1;CTAS;Cintas Corp;2011-12-21T21:49:49Z;Oracle earnings miss spurs sector sell-off;;"An earnings miss by Oracle sent software stocks tumbling on fears that large business customers are taking longer to close orders.Oracle fell 11.6 per cent to $25.77 after revenues grew just 2 per cent to $8.8bn in the three months to the end of November compared with the 7 per cent growth that had been forecast.Richard Davis, of Canaccord Genuity, stripped Oracle of its “buy” rating, saying: “Oracle will have to rebuild confidence that the firm is not headed to Microsoft’s valuation level [seven times earnings] over the next few years.”But other analysts blamed the miss on delayed purchases by corporate customers, which would affect software stocks more widely.“Management noted that IT budgets were not reduced, rather the sales cycle increased as additional levels of approval were required, which is typical of a macro slowdown,” said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund, who maintained a “buy” rating on Oracle.“Cloud” software company Red Hat, which had lowered 2012 guidance earlier in the week, fell 4.9 per cent to $39.90, now down 16.2 per cent for the week.Salesforce.com, a fast-growing software company, whose contract growth has slowed markedly in the past month, fell 5.1 per cent to $99.03.Citrix systems fell 7.8 per cent to $58.46 as Citigroup analysts said it was among the most exposed to the possibility of “non-recurring software orders” from businesses.That left the Nasdaq Composite index reeling. The technology-heavy index fell 1 per cent to 2,577.97.Research In Motion was one of the few bright spots, climbing 10.1 per cent to $13.78 on hopes that it could be an acquisition target after reports that Yahoo had considered a bid for the BlackBerry handset manufacturer.RIM’s market capitalisation has fallen 75 per cent this year due to poor sales of its PlayBook tablet
and a failure of its BlackBerry network but analysts said the share price may fall further before a buy-out.“We expect to see further pressure on RIM’s share price,” said Stuart Jeffrey at Nomura. “While we believe that RIM shares could be worth $15 in a gradual wind-down scenario, we don’t see financial buyers bidding until the stock falls below $10.”Shares in Yahoo itself were on the move too, climbing 5.9 per cent to $15.99 late in the day on reports the internet portal will sell Alibaba Group and its Japanese affiliate back to their majority holders in a deal that could be worth $17bn.Tech stocks also weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ended the day flat at 12,107.74, with IBM off 3.1 per cent to $181.47 and Cisco Systems down 2.7 per cent to $17.92.The S&P 500 edged up 0.2 per cent to 1,243.72, turning positive late in the day, despite Moody’s warning of a possible downgrade to US sovereign debt in 2012.The S&P 500 had opened lower as European nerves returned, after strong demand from the continent’s banks for three-year loans from the European Central Bank.US bank stocks also reversed early losses to close in positive territory, with Bank of America up 1.2 per cent to $5.23.Oil producers showed firmness as the price of crude oil edged up for a second day, nearing $100 a barrel, after falling as low as $94 last week. Among the smaller explorers, Noble Energy was up 1.9 per cent to $94.56 while, among the majors, ExxonMobil rose 1.4 per cent to $83.12.Cintas Corp rose 9.3 per cent to $34.19 for the best performance in the S&P 500. The provider of bathroom supplies and entrance mats raised its fiscal year 2012 profit forecast to at least $2.16 a share, 13 cents higher than expected.Nike climbed 2.9 per cent to $96.35 after the world’s largest sports goods company reported second-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates by 12 per cent on strong North American sales.Walgreen shares tumbled more than 5 per cent in early trading after the pharmacy missed earnings estimates on declining market share, but shares recovered to close down just 0.4 per cent to $33.37.Rival CVS Caremark ticked up another 1.7 per cent to $40.46 after surging 9 per cent on Tuesday, as it raised its dividend.The CBOE’s Vix index of implied volatility in the S&P 500 fell to its lowest level since the start of August, closing at 21.63. It had consistently traded above 30 from August through November."
2;CTAS;Cintas Corp;2009-12-23T22:32:46Z;Wall Street reaches fresh year high;;Dealmaking in the pharmaceuticals sector and positive news for technology companies lifted US stocks to a fresh year high on Wednesday.Drug developer Compugensurged 59.5 per cent to $4.53 after announcing that it would collaborate with Pfizer in the evaluation of three drug targets.Compugen said the evaluation would take a few months and rely on its discovery platforms.Pfizer is to fund the project and hold the rights to worldwide exclusive milestone and royalty-bearing licences. After rising in early trading, Pfizer shares finished 0.3 per cent lower at $18.55.Elsewhere in the sector, Achillion rose 15.1 per cent to $3.66 after Roth Capital initiated coverage of the pharmaceuticals company with a “buy” rating and price target of $12.Last week, Achillion announced positive results from a trial of its hepatitis C drug.The S&P 500 rallied to a fresh 2009 closing high, after Citigroup announced it had repaid $20bn in bailout money to the US government.The S&P 500 ended 0.2 per cent higher at 1,120.59, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8 per cent to 2,269.64. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 10,466.44.The market shrugged off negative data released earlier in the day. Sales of new homes in the US fell 11.3 per cent month-over-month in November, a steeper drop than predicted. Separately, the US Department of Commerce reported consumer spending was up just 0.5 per cent, compared with 0.6 per cent in October.In spite of the mixed data, technology stocks made gains. “The tech sector has held up very well, particularly the semiconductors, and that has been a good sign for the overall market,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial. “It’s an indication that global growth is sustainable.”Micron Technology was up 6.2 per cent to $9.99 after posting its first profit in more than two years.The memory chipmaker reported a fiscal first-quarter profit of $204m compared with a loss of $718m a year earlier as the company benefited from increased demand for computer and mobile devices.SanDisk added 3.1 per cent to $28.28 after ThinkEquity upgraded it from “hold” to “buy”, with a $35 price target. The brokerage said SanDisk was poised for a strong 2010 because of improved pricing trends and pared-down inventories.Yahoo was 4.3 per cent higher at $16.67 after Morgan Stanley resumed coverage of the internet search engine company.The brokerage rated Yahoo as “overweight” and said the company was starting to see growth in usage following a redesign of its homepage.Yahoo announced on Tuesday that it would cut costs by shutting down most of its operations for the week between Christmas and the new year, although consumers will not see any difference on its website.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Tibco Software climbed 7.7 per cent to $9.76. Although Tibco’s fourth-quarter profit declined 1.7 per cent to $31.7m, licensing revenue rose 4.7 per cent.Cintas, the largest US uniforms supplier, plunged 11.5 per cent to $26.27 after reporting a lower-than-expected fiscal second-quarter profit. Net income rose 5.9 per cent to $57.2m as the group continued to suffer from weak demand.Home Depot was lower following the disappointing figures for sales of new home. The country’s largest home improvement chain fell 1.1 per cent to $28.96 while peer Lowe’s was 1.7 per cent lower at $23.45.Ford closed above $10 for the first time since September 2005.The carmaker rose 1.8 per cent to $10.08 after announcing it was close to finalising a deal to sell its Volvo Swedish cars unit to China’s Geely.
3;CTAS;Cintas Corp;2009-04-23T18:50:21Z;A deal to organise;;"The Cintas commercial laundry in Islip, on New York’s Long Island, stands in a typical modern American landscape – a neat brick building in a nondescript business park adjacent to a shopping mall, with neighbours including a database analysis company and a manufacturer of bathroom fittings.Only the small signs in the parking lot, warning against “trespass, solicitation, or distribution of literature”, indicate that Cintas, a business services company, is also the focus of a big national organising effort launched six years ago by the Unite Here union.“I want to be in a union because a union would bring us many benefits and a sense of security, where my voice counts,” says Adela Viera, one of the laundry’s workers, speaking in Spanish during an interview at a nearby Starbucks. Ms Viera earns about $9.80 (£6.70, €7.50) an hour after working at the Islip laundry for almost 12 years.She and her fellow workers – washing and folding uniforms in pursuit of the American Dream – could also be in the vanguard of a revival of the US labour movement, if new efforts in Congress to strengthen the ability of unions to organise become law. “Getting a reform of labour law, restoring workers’ rights to organise, is essential for the country, the economy and the labour movement,” says Bruce Raynor, general president of Unite Here.Unionisation has been falling since the 1940s, in line with the decline in traditional manufacturing industries. Only one in eight of the workforce is these days a member; in the private sector it is one in 12. But trade unions spent hundreds of millions of dollars to support Democrats at last year’s elections and, with their party now controlling Congress and the White House, they see it as payback time.Mr Raynor argues that reforms envisaged by a labour bill before Congress, relaxing constraints on a union’s ability to secure recognition in a workplace, would lead to an “explosive growth” in union membership among workers such as Ms Viera in the service sector, as well as in manufacturing, distribution and retailing. If it is passed, unions and big business agree, the change would be the most substantial since 1947, when the 1935 Depression-era labour relations act was amended for the postwar environment.But employers are arguing that US business cannot afford to deal with union demands at a time of economic crisis – an argument that has found some traction with wavering congressional Democrats (see below).Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat from Wal-Mart’s home state of Arkansas and a previous supporter of the bill, said this month that now was not the time to pass it. “Now that we need all hands on deck, including business and labour, to get our economy moving again, this issue is dividing us,” she added.Amid the recession, unions even in the most strongly organised sectors find themselves under greater than usual pressure. One test will come at General Motors, the beleaguered carmaker, whose unions are being asked to accept reduced benefits.Yet the debate also comes at a time when public anger at the excesses of corporate America is prompting wider sympathy for trade unions. Employers in less unionised industries are therefore nervous about the implications.The proposed legislation – dubbed the Employee Free Choice Act by its supporters – would remove employers’ right to demand a secret ballot supervised by the National Labor Relations Board. Instead, it would require recognition of a union if more than half the workers have signed union cards. Orrin Hatch, a Republican senator from Utah, told a meeting of Efca opponents at the US chamber of Commerce this month the measure “should be called the Employee Coercion Act of 2009”.Employers say the secret ballot is vital to stop union organisers pressuring workers to sign up. “Workers won’t decide. Union organisers will decide,” says Richard Hankins, a lawyer at McKenna Long & Aldridge, who represents businesses on labour issues. “That does concern a lot of people.”For their part, the unions say employers can use the period between calling the ballot to browbeat workers with compulsory education sessions and intimidatory tactics. Mr Raynor argues that in general, “no unions use the current system in the US any more …because it doesn’t work”.The UFCW grocery workers union, for example, abandoned efforts to organise at Wal-Mart, the largest US private employer, in 2003. Instead, it has conducted a broad political campaign against the retailer, highlighting its low-wage model and challenging its healthcare benefits.The UFCW also points to its effort to represent a group of 10 Wal-Mart meat workers in Texas who voted to unionise in 2000. Wal-Mart subsequently closed its store meat-cutting counters. Last year – nine years after the vote – a federal appeals court upheld an NLRB ruling that Wal-Mart should start to negotiate with the union on behalf of the former meat cutters. “If ever there was a case that demonstrated how utterly bankrupt the current system is, the Jacksonville Wal-Mart case is it,” says the union.The bill would also increase the penalties for dismissing employees for engaging in union activity – currently, violators are required only to provide back pay, with no punitive damages. “[Even] when they are punished by fines, they know they can make more money. But unfortunately management can use my experience to put more pressure and harassment on my co-workers,” says Evangelina Orozco, a Unite supporter who eventually received $29,000 in back pay from Cintas after being dismissed in 2005.At Cintas, Unite Here and the Teamsters are trying to organise about 17,000 of the group’s 34,000 employees in a bitter battle that switches between the lunch rooms and parking lots of its laundries and the hearing rooms of the NLRB and the court system.In January, the NLRB ruled in favour of the union complaints, accusing Cintas of restricting workers’ rights to organise at two laundries. The board required the employer to post notices advising workers of their rights. On the other side, a federal court last year ordered the union to pay at least $5m in damages to Cintas workers whose car number plates were photographed in 2004 by organisers who wanted to use the data to get the home addresses of workers.The struggle has been intensified by the death of a Cintas worker in 2007 who was dragged into an industrial dryer at a laundry in Tulsa. The company agreed in December to pay $2.76m in damages and to add safety features to its plants. The union argues that proper worker representation would have dealt with the threat before the death happened.Cintas, which has unsuccessfully tried to sue the union under racketeering laws, says it abides by NLRB regulations. It also insists that it is not anti-union and that it respects “our partners’ rights to choose what is best for them and their families”.Not surprisingly, the company is an active opponent of Efca. Other large employers including Wal-Mart and Home Depot have been organising efforts to bring pressure to bear on local members of Congress.Although President Barack Obama – a co-sponsor of a card check bill as a senator in 2007 – has voiced support for the legislation since his election, he has not spent time on the issue. Suspicions remain that he would prefer the bill to be killed in Congress so as not to be faced with signing legislation that business leaders argue would kill jobs amid a fierce recession.Given the diverse support he attracted during the campaign, Mr Obama may ultimately be less dependent on the unions than previous Democrat presidents. “He’s the first Democratic candidate who has not relied on the turnout mechanism of organised labour,” notes a business lobbyist. “He comes in probably more ideologically aligned with organised labour, but owing them less.”Whatever the final fate of Efca’s card count recognition clause, the labour movement can still expect to see benefits from the Obama presidency: Hilda Solis, the new labour secretary, is regarded as an ally. This month, her department speeded up regulations designed to prevent a lung disease thought to be caused in popcorn manufacture. A campaigning issue for unions, the step had been held up by the previous administration.The card check battle could end with a compromise that includes the tougher penalties for anti-union intimidation and compulsory arbitration for the first contract negotiated between an employer and a new union.So for would-be unionists at the Cintas laundry and across the country, there is still the prospect of a rebalancing of labour laws. For employers scared of a pro-union administration, the apprehension lingers on.DEMOCRATIC DIVISIONS: ‘CARD CHECK’ BECOMES A REALITY CHECK IN A WARY CONGRESSThe election of President Barack Obama and the increased numbers of Democrats in Congress gave hope to trade unions that some of their most sought-after measures might become reality, writes Tom Braithwaite.After eight years in which the National Labor Relations Board exerted a pro-business stance under the administration of George W. Bush, an Employee Free Choice Act to make unionisation easier remains top of activists’ wish-list.But three months after Mr Obama’s inauguration, prospects for the law have faded even though Democrats, backed by hundreds of millions of union dollars, are under pressure to push forward with a union-friendly agenda.“We have the president on our side,” says Richard Trumka, secretary treasurer of the AFL-CIO union coalition. True, Mr Obama has backed publicly the so-called “card check” legislation – requiring a union to be recognised if more than half the workers have signed union cards – and as a senator he supported a previous version of the bill in 2007. But the suspicion remains that the administration, like some Democrats in Congress, would prefer that the bill went away as the country grappled with the recession.Since the legislation was introduced last month, both unions and employers – led by the US Chamber of Commerce – took up arms on what Arlen Specter, a centrist Republican senator, called the “most heavily lobbied issue I can recall”.Wearied by calls to back the law and under pressure from his own party, Mr Specter decided he could not vote in favour and mooted a weaker compromise. His decision dealt a potentially fatal blow to the legislation.Even if all the Senate’s Democrats vote in favour, they need one Republican to join them to reach the 60 votes necessary for it to pass. Though risking union wrath, not all Democrats will. Last week, newspapers in neighbouring Kansas and Colorado took aim, coincidentally, at the unwillingness of local senators to state their position.To come out against card check in its current form – the stance of Blanche Lincoln, a senator for Wal-Mart’s home state of Arkansas, and Dianne Feinstein, senator for California – is a risk for most Democrats, so important is the unions’ financial fire-power and ability to get out the vote.But either way, centrist Democrats tread a delicate path, such is the opposition to the bill from business groups and the difficulty of assessing the public’s view. The AFL-CIO points to a poll that shows 73 per cent of Americans are in favour of card check but other polls are less stark or turn the other way.“The biggest challenge in polling on an issue like Efca is that so few Americans are aware of the actual bill or the conflicts between organised labour and management,” writes Mark Blumenthal, editor of Pollster.com, on his poll analysis website. He points to a Gallup poll that shows 53 per cent of respondents in favour of a law making it easier to organise workers. But the polling organisation acknowledges that an “exceptionally low” number say they are following the issue closely.If card check fails, there is likely to be a day of reckoning for Democrats whose support wavered. The price of continued union backing is likely to be some sort of compromise measure as well as the formation of a more liberal National Labor Relations Board and pro-union executive orders from Mr Obama, which would not have to navigate a doubtful Senate.“It’s premature to pop the Champagne corks,” says Steven Law, chief legal officer of the Chamber of Commerce. On the other side, unions are hoping their own celebration is not on ice for too long."
4;CTAS;Cintas Corp;2006-08-08T20:48:17Z;Aramark board agrees $6.3bn buyout;;Aramark’s board on Tuesday agreed to a sweetened $6.3bn management buyout of the US food-service group, five years after it was taken public by Joseph Neubauer, chairman and chief executive.Philadelphia-based Aramark is expected to generate revenues of around $11.6bn this year, with two-thirds generated from food and beverage sales at schools, hospitals and sports stadiums.The company also manages food outlets and supplies uniforms and other clothing, and a key contractor at last year’s Olympics in Athens, building on its experience in supplying 14 Major League Baseball stadiums.The latest proposal highlights both the larger scale of private-equity purchases and the move into more service-orientated businesses from the core of manufacturing transactions in recent years, highlighted by the recent offer for HCA, the hospital operator.The cash offer from Mr Neubauer, a former PepsiCo executive who joined the company in 1979, and a group of private-equity investors of $33.80 represents a 20 per cent premium on the proposal they made in May.The consortium aims to close the transaction in late 2006 or early 2007, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.Mr Neubauer, who emigrated from Israel 40 years ago, controls 40 per cent of the class A voting stock.He became chief executive of in 1983 and led another management buy-out a year later to fend off a hostile take-over bid for the company, then known as ARA for the company, then known as ARA Services.While Aramark has generated cash flow in line with net earnings – forecast at around $280m this year – its stock price has lagged peers such as Cintas and Servicemaster, generally trading around the $25 float price.“The original offer had been expected to flush out rival bids, and Aramark’s board appointed Credit Suisse to review the proposal from Mr Neubauer, backed by the private equity units of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, as well as Thomas H. Lee Partners, Warburg Pincus and CCMP Capital.The proposal also involves the assumption of $2bn in debt.Aramark is due to report third-quarter results on Wednesday.
