Microchip Technology, the US semiconductor manufacturer, agreed on Thursday to purchase Microsemi Corporation in a deal worth $10bn when including debt.Microchip, valued at about $21bn, will pay $68.78 to Microsemi shareholders, the two companies said in a joint statement. The deal is expected to expand Microchip’s offerings in the data centre, communications, defence and aerospace markets.“Joining forces and combining our complementary product portfolios and end market exposure will offer our customers a richer set of solution options to enable innovative and competitive products for the markets they serve,” said Microchip president Ganesh Moorthy.JPMorgan advised Microchip on the deal and is providing the group $5.6bn in committed financing to fund the takeover. Qatalyst Partners advised Microsemi.The companies added that they expected the deal to close in the second quarter of this year. Shares of both groups were halted before after-hours trading began. Once trading resumed, Microchip shares were up 6.1 per cent to $94.49, and Microsemi shares were up 5 per cent to $67.54.Dealmaking in the technology sector has started the year at a frenetic pace, with more than $100bn of mergers and acquisitions announced so far, according to Dealogic. That is the fastest start to a year since the dotcom boom and bust in 2000.

It is best known for designing components used within hands-free driving headsets and other Bluetooth wireless technology.People familiar with the matter suggested that Qualcomm approached CSR about a deal when news of Microchip’s talks with the UK chip designer leaked last month.The UK company rejected an initial approach by Microchip in late August in what analysts said would be a proposed tax inversion deal. The White House has cracked down on attempts by US companies to move their domiciles to Europe to avert such moves. On Tuesday AbbVie, the US pharmaceutical group, said it was reconsidering its $54bn takeover of UK drugmaker Shire.Qualcomm has 400 employees in the UK, including a hub in Cambridge, and it is expected to maintain CSR’s base in the city. However, full integration plans and any potential job cuts at CSR, which employs 2,130 people in 11 countries, will be finalised in the months before the deal closes.Joep van Beurden, CSR’s chief executive, said the deal would give his company, which will now become a significant division within Qualcomm, the resources to compete with bigger rivals.“This deal is a ringing endorsement of CSR’s product, technology and our team,” he said. “If you look at the overall lay of the land in the semiconductor industry, it is very important to have scale, and with this transaction we’ve achieved that.“I think it’s a compliment to the British tech scene. Qualcomm is the global leader . . . it’s a very good to be part of that, and it will allow us to continue to grow our business over the next couple of years.”Qualcomm said the acquisition would strengthen its position in the so-called internet of everything, where everyday objects, from watches to fridges, are able to interact with each other and connect to the web.“The addition of CSR’s technology leadership in Bluetooth, Bluetooth Smart and audio processing will strengthen Qualcomm’s position in providing critical solutions that drive the rapid growth of the internet of everything, including the business areas such as portable audio, automotive and wearable devices,” said Steven Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive.Analysts said the deal looked like a good fit for Qualcomm but did not rule out a possible counterbid.“With a firm price now out in the open, we can’t rule out other bidders, but only a handful of semis [semiconductor] companies could compete with Qualcomm on this, in our view,” Robert Lamb and Lee Simpson of Jefferies wrote in a note.Shares in CSR, which have performed strongly since the initial approach from Microchip, jumped 35 per cent in early trading in London to 875p.The Qualcomm offer represents a 57 per cent premium to CSR’s share price before Microchip’s initial approach became public in August. It represents a multiple of three times enterprise value to sales.Microchip had until Wednesday evening to return with an improved offer. The US chipmaker issued a profit warning this month.There has been a wave of consolidation between semiconductor groups in recent times. In September, German chipmaker Infineon Technologies acquired the US group International Rectifier for about $3bn. In April, Cirrus Logic, based in Texas, bought the Scottish chip designer Wolfson Electronics for £278m.

Tesla’s existing Model S fleet reaches 60mph in 5.4 seconds.“To some extent, the all-wheel drive (AWD) Model S is playing catch-up with other luxury makers that already offer AWD on many of their vehicles – (we don’t see the addition of AWD to the Model S as a game-changer),” said Brian Johnson, an analyst at Barclays.Mr Musk had generated a lot of interest with a cryptic tweet leading up to the event that read “about time to unveil the D and something else”. Tesla shares fell 8 per cent to $236.91 on Friday.But the shares had been buoyant going into the event against a backdrop of falls for the rest of the auto sector.“The auto sector has been down since the first of October – given the relative gains Tesla has made, people are adjusting their positions and taking some of the profit off the table,” said George Galliers, associate managing director at ISI Group.“Yesterday was positive but it isn’t going to have a material impact on earnings or change assumptions in a meaningful way.”Tesla shares are up 57 per cent so far this year.Shares of Symantec fell 7 per cent to $21.94 after the company announced late on Thursday that it would separate into two public companies, with one focused on security and the other on its storage business.Analysts at BMO said the two businesses will be better off following the split but they will still face challenges.“Products and technology have not kept up with the pace of technology development, and the transition to the cloud and competition against smaller, more focused companies remain a big challenge,” said Joel Fishbein, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.“This leaves us unconvinced that growth reacceleration is around the corner.”Shares of Darden Restaurants declined 2 per cent to $21.94 after Starboard Value, the investment firm that had clashed with Darden executives, won 12 seats on the company’s board of directors to take full control, a preliminary tally of votes at Darden’s annual meeting showed.Infosys shares gained 6 per cent to $62.82 after the Indian information technology company beat expectations on profit and announced bonus shares.The company reported a 29 per cent increase in profits to Rs31bn ($505m) in the three months ended in September. Revenues climbed nearly 3 per cent from the year-ago period.Analysts were looking for profits of Rs28.5bn, on revenue of Rs135.9bn.Semiconductor maker Microchip Technology weighed on the broader sector after the company warned of weak revenue in the three months ending September 30. The shares fell 12 per cent $39.96.The S&P 500 slipped 1.1 per cent to 1,906.13, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7 per cent to 16,544.10 and the Nasdaq Composite was hit by the scale of the tech falls, sinking 2.3 per cent to 4,276.24.Email: mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
5;MCHP;Microchip Technology;2014-09-25T12:48:18Z;CSR tops mid-cap index on takeover talk;Microchip Tech granted extension to deadline on bid talks;Chipmaker CSR climbed to the top of the mid-cap index on Thursday as takeover speculation resurfaced about the possibility of a renewed bid from a US rival.CSR shares gained 7.4 per cent to 782.5p after the UK Takeover Panel granted US suitor Microchip Technology an extension to continue talks with the British company.The previous deadline for Microchip to make an offer was four o’clock on Thursday afternoon after CSR rejected an initial approach in August, but the deadline was extended to 1600 GMT on October 15.The price of the offer in August was not disclosed, but the Financial Times reported it could value CSR at $3bn, which analysts suggested would represent £11 per share.Cairn Energy, the mid-cap oil explorer, gained 3.6 per cent to 187.3p after it announced a farm out deal to sell a 10 per cent stake in the North Sea Catcher oilfield to Dyas UK, who will pay $182m to fund development of the field.The FTSE 250 index had outperformed the blue-chip index for much of the morning, but had faded by mid afternoon, edging 0.1 per cent lower to 15,531.79.Among the stock weighing on the mid-cap index was Mitchells & Butlers, the pub and restaurant operator, which fell 4.9 per cent to 385.8p after reporting falling like-for-like sales growth in the nine weeks to September 20.Mining groups were lower on both indices as a rampant dollar, slack demand and debt troubles at a Chinese state-owned steel producer, hit metals prices.Ferrexpo, the iron ore miner, fell 3.8 per cent to 123p, while Lonmin lost 3.3 per cent to 185.4p and Polymetal shed 3.3 per cent to 481.3p.It was a similar story on the FTSE 100, where Anglo American lost 3.3 per cent to £14.13, Fresnillo shed 2.8 per cent to 753.5p and BHP Billiton lost 2.4 per cent to £17.54.The senior index fell 0.3 per cent to 6,682.11.Airlines made the best of falling commodity prices on hopes of lower fuel costs. EasyJet was up 2.4 per cent to £13.46 and IAG, the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, added 1.2 per cent to 370.9p.On the downside, asset manager Hargreaves Lansdown fell 4.1 per cent to 925p after RBC downgraded the stock to perform from outperform, saying the valuation was too high.
6;MCHP;Microchip Technology;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Chipmaker CSR rejects Microchip Technology offer;;CSR, the UK chipmaker, said it rejected a takeover approach from Microchip Technology, a larger US rival, as it became the latest European company to become the target of a proposed tax inversion deal.Shares in CSR, formerly known as Cambridge Silicon Radio, soared 35.6 per cent in London trading after the Financial Times reported the company was exploring a sale after receiving takeover bids.CSR confirmed an approach in a statement and said: “The price proposed by Microchip has been rejected and the board is considering its options for the company.”Analysts said Microchip could use a deal with CSR to re-domicile its tax base to a low-tax country in Europe in a so-called inversion. Doing so would allow the Arizona-based group to use its non-US earnings without having to pay US taxes on them. The company, which has a market capitalisation of $9.6bn, did not immediately respond to request for comment on the tax element of the deal.An exact price being offered for the business could not be ascertained but analysts at NSBO suggested CSR could fetch as much as $2.7bn. CSR said it is working with JPMorgan Chase but did not give any details around its plans.CSR is a semiconductor company that designs – but does not build – chips and components, used in mobile phones and satellite navigation systems. It is best known for designing components used within hands-free driving headsets and other Bluetooth wireless technology.Searching for future growth, CSR has attempted to wind down its “legacy” products and is making a push into the so-called “internet of things” – a catch-all term for physical goods, often appliances, that combine technology and hardware used in day-to-day human activities. In particular, it has developed components for the controllers of other “smart objects”, such as a remote control that would be able communicate with all the lights within a home.Dry your tears with £50 notes. Another one-time UK tech hopeful may be taken over for a stiff price. CSR has fielded and rejected an offer from US partner Microchip Technology, writes Jonathan Guthrie.Continue readingThere has been a buzz around the sector since Google paid $3.2bn for Nest Labs, the smart thermostat business, at the start of the year. The deal, the second largest in Google’s history behind its $12.5bn Motorola Mobility acquisition in 2011, raised eyebrows among investors for what was perceived to be a high price.But technology experts expect the sector, which spans wearables, driverless cars and kitchen appliances that can predict when their owner needs to stock up on certain items, to be an important battleground for Silicon Valley’s established giants.Dealmaking among semiconductor companies has surged in the past few months. The unglamorous but essential end of the technology sector has seen a wave of consolidation, including Infineon Technologies’ acquisition this month of International Rectifier for close to $3bn.The activity comes against a backdrop of a broad-based mergers and acquisitions upcycle. The value of deals worldwide has passed the $2tn mark for the year to date and is set to be the best 12 months for dealmaking since 2007, the peak of the credit boom.
7;MCHP;Microchip Technology;2014-08-28T10:00:05Z;Fridge shall speak unto oven via fully-priced CSR;Another one-time UK tech hopeful may be taken over for a stiff price;"Dry your tears with £50 notes. Another one-time UK tech hopeful may be taken over for a stiff price. CSR, best known for making wireless phone headsets beloved of minicab drivers, has fielded and rejected an offer from US partner Microchip Technology.No auctioneer talks down the price of a lot. So the suggested value for the business of more than £1.7bn, or £10 a share after cash deductions, could ordinarily be dismissed as toppy. However, prices for tech businesses continually surprise gloomsters. So a premium of 80 per cent is conceivable. Liberum suggests £7-£9 a share would be more reasonable.It all depends whether Microchip or other bidders believe CSR’s technology, which includes devices for the modish “internet of things”, will combine profitably with their own; also, how big bidders’ cash piles are and whether they can save tax by relocating headquarters.In April, Wolfson Microelectronics, a weaker, smaller business, was snapped up by Cirrus Logic of the US at a 75 per cent premium, equivalent to 20 times forecast 2015 earnings.At £1.7bn, the business formerly known as Cambridge Silicon Radio would go out for roughly 37 times predicted 2014 earnings. That is where Arm, designer of chips for mobile devices, trades. Arm is a better business. CSR has been reinventing itself and earnings have been patchy. But there is a premium for control.In future, not only shall nation speak peace unto nation, but fridge shall speak dinner unto oven. Sceptics suspect margins for connecting users with prosaic domestic appliances will never attain those for such electronic handbag poodles as the iPhone. But there are enough believers to ensure demand for CSR.Roadside warriorsA chief executive aspires to become the toast of the City. Too often, he merely becomes toast. Chris Jansen has joined the legion of the lightly grilled after just eight months at the top of the AA, the insurer and roadside rescue group.Mr Jansen discussed a possible secondary buyout of the AA with would-be buyer Apax this spring. Instead, former Green Flag boss Bob Mackenzie mounted an innovative initial public offering to transfer AA from the ownership of private equity houses to that of long funds.Mr Mackenzie soldiers on as executive chairman, a dual role governance that fundamentalists frown at. Mr Jansen shoves off in search of new opportunities. His fleeting contribution to AA was celebrated in a letter to employees that the GMB union, a foe of private equity, obtained and circulated to every journalist in the country.Mr Mackenzie one-upped both Mr Jansen and the RAC with his accelerated bookbuild. But, the rival roadside assistance group should not suffer by being the second to float, if it does so this autumn. AA, bearing a burden of seven times debt to bare earnings, is one of those companions that can make a person better-looking by comparison.RAC was geared around five times at the end of last year, which is still steep. A valuation of £2bn is mooted, presumably including debt. That implies an enterprise value of around 14 times earnings, higher than AA and a shade less than the median for a consumer services group.Chris Woodhouse, chief executive, will have his work cut out to spin a growth story, particularly in the saturated motor insurance sector. But he has already outlasted Mr Jansen.Noblesse obligeA misdirected email received by Lombard shows that The Centre for the Study of the Centre, a top political think-tank, is grappling with the issue of elitism in public life. Director Rupert Kensington-Wonkke addresses staff thus:“Dear thought leaders, I have been pondering the worrying problem of hereditary privilege while vacationing at our little family place in Tuscany.“Ed has relocated his socialist mojo. So this is set to be a hot button electoral issue. Now holidays are over, the CSC should seize the initiative in the elitism debate ahead of those oiks at the Institute for Public Policy Research.“We will therefore publish a report substantiating the contribution the independent sector has made to social mobility. Our great public schools not only award scholarships to poor children with pushy parents. They also provide fee-paying places to pupils whose fathers were literally penniless before becoming billionaires in the former Soviet Union.“The report working group will be truly inclusive. Even colleagues who only attended Charterhouse may participate. I will trail our conclusions with the PM at a forthcoming night at the opera. I’m hoping he’ll remember I fagged for him at Eton.”jonathan.guthrie@ft.com"
8;MCHP;Microchip Technology;2013-12-02T15:54:46Z;The web has not yet killed the art of sales;Techniques have not changed as much as some online evangelists claim;"Call me naive, but somehow I expected more from the double-glazing salesman I recently invited into my home. I knew about confusing pitches, pressure tactics, cowboy installers and fly-by-night manufacturers. You do not have to do much research to appreciate that sellers of double glazing are in the hard-sell hall of fame, alongside used-car vendors and estate agents.But I had also read the latest literature – such as Dan Pink’s book To Sell Is Human– which points to a change in the selling culture. The internet has evened up the odds. Customers are now as well, if not better, informed than sales agents. I needed new windows and I reckoned I would at least gain an insight into a more transparent era of selling.I reckoned wrong. The national company I asked to quote first sent an old-school salesman with a box of all the worn-out tricks I thought the web was supposed to have eliminated: the “limited availability” discount; the sign-now, pay-less offer; and the “why wouldn’t you?” financing deal. He insisted I should sign up to the last, even after I had mentioned I worked for the FT and wanted more time to examine the terms. Until I made clear a local supplier had got the job, the company kept harassing me with follow-up calls.Why have these techniques survived? In part, because of the nature of the product. In all except newly built homes, windows are non-standard, tailored to the size and condition of the hole they fill. Online double-glazing companies do exist, but the choices, befuddling jargon (espangolet or shootbolt locking?), and risk of getting the order expensively wrong, would drive even dedicated bargain hunters back to a more old-fashioned intermediary.Life is harder for sales forces in other areas. Take another bespoke glazed item – prescription spectacles. Giving a cruel twist to the competitive challenge, online rivals prosper in part because incumbent opticians carry out the all-important eyetests for them. Armed with this information – equivalent to my window measurements – customers order lenses with relative confidence online, while browsing limitless options for frames. The cost of going wrong is low. Opticians are left fighting a rearguard action based on limited stock, sketchy personal service and customers’ residual fears about trusting their vision to an anonymous website.Online competition and comparison have turned mobile phone purchase on its head, too. Phone contracts in the UK are notoriously complex. Yet as a sales tactic, obfuscation has its limits these days. When I upgraded my phone recently, I had a clear idea of the model I wanted and the package of voice, data and texts I needed. Unable to cut her price, the nice saleswoman at my existing operator was powerless to prevent my switching to a competitor, whose offer I could see online while I negotiated.The notion that in this tougher environment most sales teams are at best weakened and at worst redundant is not as compelling as it may look, however. Mr Pink says the data show salespeople are still “a stalwart part of labour markets around the world”. But to survive, they have to learn to “upserve” customers rather than simply upsell to them. He cites companies such as Microchip Technology, a US semiconductor company, which decreased the variable element of its vendors’ pay, and saw sales rise. Apple hires brand converts for its stores because, as FT contributor Philip Delves Broughton has written, they sell “ out of enthusiasm, not just for commission”.My unpleasant encounter with old-style sales was, in some ways, rather reassuring. Techniques have not changed as much as some evangelists claim. The human touch remains vital. The way my double glazing salesman got me to provide clues about myself as he ran through his patter was impressive, even if he then went on to ignore them.But while I suspect it will take time for online competition to smash double glazing, sales agents who focus narrowly on closing the deal could still benefit from a wider perspective, as a final personal sales tale suggests. Facing a big bill to repair our ageing people-carrier, I consulted a former car salesman, recommended by a friend, who now helps buyers navigate the used car market. Should we repair or replace the vehicle, I asked, expecting a self-interested response. He suggested repair. Guess who is the first person I will call when replacement becomes our only option.andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghill"
9;MCHP;Microchip Technology;2012-03-13T13:31:18Z;Arm unveils chip for ‘internet of things’;;Arm Holdings, the British microchip design company, has unveiled an ultra-low-power chip that could pave the way for a multitude of devices from washing machines to parking meters to be connected wirelessly into an “internet of things”.The Cambridge-based company, whose designs dominate the mobile phone sector, said on Tuesday it had created the world’s most efficient microprocessor design. The chip is capable of the same kind of fast processing as the chips in smartphones, but uses just a third of the electrical power of a very basic, 8-bit microprocessor.Chips using Arm’s “Flycatcher” design would be just 1mm square and be able to run off a small battery for very long periods of time, meaning they could be embedded in products such as blood pressure monitors that could transmit information wirelessly to doctors’ surgeries.The chips might also be able to connect home appliances such as washing machines to a home network, switching them on and off to regulate energy consumption, for example.Some home appliances today may contain 8-bit or 16-bit processors but these cannot handle very complex functions.“The internet of things will change the world as we know it, improving energy efficiency, safety and convenience,” said Tom Halfhill, a senior analyst with The Linley Group. “Ubiquitous network connectivity is useful for almost everything – from adaptive room lighting and online video gaming to smart sensors and motor control. But it requires extremely low-cost, low-power processors that still can deliver good performance.”Ericsson, the telecoms equipment company, recently forecast that there would be about 50bn connected devices by 2020, rising from about 5bn in 2010.Arm said it expected Flycatcher-based chips to sell for about 13p to 20p per chip, from which it would gain a 1-2 per cent royalty. Although the percentage is low, the volume of chips potentially coming to the market could make this a valuable revenue stream for Arm.NXP Semiconductors and Freescale, two semiconductor manufacturers, have already licensed the design.Arm will face some competition in the ultra low-power market, however. Other chip designers, including Microchip Technology and Atmel in the US, are developing such chips.
10;MCHP;Microchip Technology;2011-09-30T16:52:52Z;Scouring the data for quality indications;How I go about picking “quality” stocks;What constitutes a quality stock? In last week’s column, I began trying to define the criteria for picking shares in mega-cap companies with strong business franchises. As you’d expect, there are a great many definitions of “quality”, some involving attributes that might equally be ascribed to a “defensive” company, others to companies with valuable “strategic assets”, such as large oil and gas reserves. “Value” investors, meanwhile, might see quality more in terms of companies paying a sustainable dividend yield.As last week’s headline – Quality in the eye of the beholder – surmised, any definition is intensely personal. It is easy to pick a list of companies with a loosely defined “great business franchise”: such a list would probably contain Microsoft, Google, ExxonMobil, BG Group, AstraZeneca and Vodafone. However, I prefer to start with a quantitative screening of the market, and then add a series of personal overlays. These overlays are essentially tests of whether a company can defend its business franchise in an era of low-growth rates and intense price competition.To do this, I use a piece of software called Sharescope, which allows you to sift fundamental data on both UK and US stocks – but you can run a similar exercise using web-based services such as the FT’s stock screener at www.markets.ft.com/screener/customScreen.aspA quick update on Golden Prospect, the precious metals fund I mentioned a few weeks back. As part of its fundraising, it is offering new subscription shares. These are priced at 150p and can be converted into ordinary shares every quarter from May 2012 to May 2014.A few institutions are wary of subscription shares, thinking they could dilute profits for existing investors. But they could be especially appealing to outside investors looking for a medium-term hedge. In effect, you’re buying an option on gold – if spot prices shoot up past $2,500 I’d expect profit margins at the gold miners to soar, producing an uplift in their share prices.These subscription shares will be geared to this increase – so, in effect, you could look on them as a bet on really bad things happening in the global economy. Of course, if gold prices fall back, the subscription shares could expire worthless, but that’s the nature of insurance.My quantitative screen is relatively simple. I’m trying to find a large-cap stock in the UK and the US, with a decent dividend, controllable debts, a substantial profit margin, and lots of cash inflows. So these are the fundamentals measures that I screen for – and note that I deliberately exclude any banks or financial institutions.● Market capitalisation > £2bn● Dividend cover > 1.5● Historical dividend yield > 4 per cent● Net gearing < 150 per cent● Operating margin > 5 per cent (unless it is a utility company)● Cash flow per share: positive (unless it is a utility company)Where more than two companies from the same sector are identified, I will only take the two with the best figures for yields, dividend cover and net gearing.This “screen” will probably throw up a couple of dozen “big-name” candidates, which I will then whittle down to a shorter list by carrying out a qualitative investigation of the business franchise. By this I mean finding out whether a company has a clearly discernible “moat” of competitive advantage, which should deter low-margin competitors. To do this, the simplest approach is to look at past profit margins to check the trend, then search press commentary on the company, and then list the strengths and weaknesses of its main competitors.In this process, I tend to favour companies with substantial strategic assets, such as oil reserves – that’s why I’m currently a bull on the large integrated oil majors. I also believe that utilities have an innate attraction for long-term investors, as their businesses are heavily regulated and built around the notion of returning cash to shareholders through dividends.When I recently carried out this combined quantitative/qualitative screening process, I ended up with the following 14 stocks (although I’d be tempted to have only one North American telecoms utility – either BCE or AT&T – and I’m not entirely convinced about Microchip Technology’s inherent competitive advantage).My shortlist contains lots of companies that I don’t think you’d find surprising.BAE Systems is having a rough time at the moment due to declining orders, but it still possesses some fantastic technology and products. Drug companies are usually popular among fund managers right now, and both AstraZeneca and US group Eli Lilly make it on to my list. Tobacco stocks have long been popular with income fund managers such as Neil Woodford at Invesco Perpetual, and Vodafone offers strong yields and international diversification. All of these companies are in some way protected by that “moat” of competitive advantage. Then, meeting my strategic assets criterion, there are oil majors in the shape of Royal Dutch Shell and American outfit Marathon Oil.

Resolute Mining added 7.2 per cent to A$1.34.Macarthur Coal was the biggest gainer after it received a bid from ArcelorMittal, the European steelmaker, and Peabody Energy, the US coal producer, valuing the company at A$4.7bn.A turbulent week for financial stocks, however, left Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 down 3.9 per cent over the five sessions at 4,473.5.Profit warnings in the global semiconductor sector left shares in many Asia-Pacific chipmakers languishing.Novellus Systems and Microchip Technology, both of the US, warned on profits, while Dutch group ASML Holding said it had suffered a fall off in orders.Japan’s Elpida Memory fell 17.1 per cent over the week to Y753, while Hong Kong-listed ASM Pacific Technology lost 13.4 per cent to HK$89.85.South Korean chipmaker Samsung Electronics lost 6 per cent to Won832,000Toyota Auto Body climbed 9.7 per cent to Y1,480 and Kanto Auto Works rose 6.3 per cent to Y829 after Toyota Motor said it would bring its separately-listed car assembly subsidiaries under its wing, making them fully-owned units.Shares in Toyota Motor, however, were down 3.3 per cent to Y3,330 as the strong yen hurt exporters.The Nikkei 225 Average ended 1.6 per cent lower over the week at 9,974.47.Taiwan’s benchmark fell 2 per cent this week to 8,574.91, undermined by technology sector losses.Electronic parts manufacturer Yageo fell 16.5 per cent over the week to T$10.60 after the country’s Investment Commission rejected a T$46.8bn management buy-out backed by private equity firm KKR.The Shanghai Composite was a rare gainer, climbing 0.8 per cent over the week to 2,820.2 after its robust GDP reading.The Hang Seng fell 3.7 per cent to 21,875.38 as its high weighting of financial and property stocks were hit by fears that Beijing would raise interest rates.The FTSE Asia Pacific index fell 2 per cent on the week to 262.19.
12;MCHP;Microchip Technology;2011-07-14T22:22:37Z;Wall St stocks fall amid default concerns;;Wall Street stocks closed down after an early equity rally amid concern that US politicians may fail to agree on raising the US debt ceiling, which could lead to a catastrophic default, and as investors reassessed the likelihood of the Federal Reserve’s embarking on “quantitative easing”.In spite of initial efforts to look away from the possibility of Moody’s downgrading the US debt, equities pulled back after modest morning gains. Relatively good economic news and JPMorgan Chase beating earnings estimates initially helped investors gain confidence. JPMorgan Chase, the first big bank to report results, was up 1.84 per cent at $40.35 after announcing that its second-quarter profits rose 13 per cent to $5.4bn or $1.27 a share, in net income.“Bernanke’s comments took away the enthusiasm. The market reacted, as it is very much focused on negotiations in Washington”, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.4 per cent at 12,437.12, after climbing almost 90 points early in the session, when investors were focused on the heavyweight bank’s growth. Financials, one of the worst performing sectors, are under pressure to show that they can increase revenue. Citigroup is due to release earnings on Friday.“But there were some good news in the retail sales and employment fronts, and good numbers from JPMorgan pushed it up a little initially. All in all, this is still a very cautious market looking at debt issues, both in Europe and the US, and the corporate earnings season”, Ms Krosby said.According to the US Commerce Department, retail sales rose 0.1 per cent in June, after dipping 0.1 per cent in May, while weekly jobless claims dropped 22,000 to 405,000, compared to an expected figure of 415,000.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was in negative territory, down 1.2 per cent at 2,762.67 and the benchmark S&P 500 also closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,308.87. All of the S&P sectors lost ground, closing in negative territory.Yet ConocoPhillips was one of the S&P top performers at 1.6 per cent to $75.61, after an early announcement that the company plans to split its refining and production businesses into two different publicly traded companies.“We estimate the value range on a split-up is between $73 and $92 per share. Essentially, we see little downside to owning the stock at current levels. Overall, we estimate we can comfortably get to $80 per share on a break-up value,” said Faisel Khan, analyst with Citi investment research.“It remains to be seen how ConocoPhillips will deal with the downstream, how it will allocate the midstream and chemicals business among the separated company, whether there will be dis-synergies and most importantly how the upstream business will be valued. The upstream valuation is the key component here,” he added.Yum! Brands, reached an all-time high at $57.75 before paring its gains at 1.4 per cent to $56.37. On Wednesday, the US fast food Restaurant Group, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, reported a 10 per cent gain in profits, or $0.65 per share, in the second quarter, beating analysts’ expectations and raising its full-year forecast. According to the company’s chief executive, David Novak, profit was helped by “strong performance in China and other emerging markets”, with sales in China growing more than 18 per cent.“Outlook for consolidated fundamentals are probably coming down slightly, with upside in China not fully offsetting weakness in the US. That said, Yum! is making the case for multiple expansion, which should be more important for the shares,” said Keith Siegner, an analyst with Credit Suisse.Google closed down 1.7 per cent to $528.94, but jumped as earnings results, released after the closing bell, exceeded estimates. The search engine group’s shares rose 12.5 per cent to $595.25 in after-hours trading.After hitting all-time high of $304.80 in early trading in the previous session Netflix, the DVD subscription and streaming video company, tumbled to $286.62, down 4.1 per cent. The company’s move to overhaul its pricing policy aimed at pushing users toward its growing streaming service has received criticisms and alienated some users.The microchip sub-sector was down with Microchip Technology, a chipmaker, down 1.2 per cent at $32.01 after reporting lower sales, and Novellus, a manufacturer of equipment for chipmakers, was also down 1.3 per cent at $31.58.Again, in the spotlight, News Corp tumbled 3.1 per cent at $15.43, following news the FBI opened an investigation into allegations that the media giant also hacked into the phones of September 11 victims. Also on Thursday, Rupert Murdoch and his son James, were summoned to appear before the UK Parliament, as a result of the British newspaper phone-hacking scandal. News Corp pared in the previous session after the company dropped its bid for BSkyB.

This week, Microchip Technology, a US chipmaker, reported lower sales. Novellus, which makes manufacturing equipment for chipmakers, said bookings from customers fell 25 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first. ASML, another equipment-maker, warned of sharply deteriorating orders.Economy-watchers keep track of the sector because these companies are forced to look into the future. Chips produced now will go into products sold at Christmas. Equipment ordered now will churn out chips next year.There is a reassuring theory about the warnings: the chip cycle is turning again. The sector’s gyrations have traditionally been self-induced. Chipmakers buy too much manufacturing kit, which creates more capacity than the market can bear. In 2005, for example, there was a sharp downturn in the sector even though the global economy grew.But the industry is made up of fewer companies these days and they behave more rationally. This time around, chipmakers and equipment manufacturers are blaming a shortage of consumer demand, rather than an excess of supply.The weakness seems widespread. Sluggish PC sales are not a surprise, but smartphone and tablet sales are also weaker than expected. Microchip Technology also reported disappointing sales of its chips for cars, though this could be due to disruptions caused by the earthquake in Japan.Investors did not see the bad news coming: shares in Microchip Technology, Novellus and ASML dropped 10, 11 and 7 per cent respectively this week. They will watch next week’s results from Intel, the big daddy of the sector, even more attentively than usual.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

There was a little bit of a short squeeze especially in the equity market”, says John Brady, senior vice-president of Global Interest Rate Products at MF Global.This is the first time since the US economy hit a “soft patch” in the spring that the Fed has raised the possibility of further monetary action, which would likely mean more quantitative easing, the policy of securities such as Treasury bonds in order to drive down long-term interest rates.So investors were focused on the Fed’s comments to gain clues into the Fed’s thinking of how the US economy is doing.“The markets reacted positively to the whole idea that the QE3 is a valuable policy alternative. Now it is a matter of political time in Washington to see if it is implemented and if, with the debt debate, the fiscal policy is going to turn more restrictive,” Mr Brady explains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average which hit its lowest level of the month in the previous session, managed to eke out gains to finish the session 0.5 per cent higher to 12,446.8.The Nasdaq Composite remained below the red line, down 0.8 per cent to 2,782. The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, rose above 3 per cent to almost 20.“After two days of double-digit decline, now some money is going into more defensive sectors,” said Ralph Fogel, partner and investment strategist for wealth management and advisory firm Fogel Neale Partners in New York.Among key S&P sectors industrials slid, while utilities saw some gains, closing at 0.5 per cent.After leading a slight recovery during the day financials retreated as the session drew to an end, closing 0.3 per cent lower, and extending a 2.8 per cent drop on Monday. Ahead of the key second-quarter earnings, JPMorgan Chase was down 0.1 per cent to $39.39 while Citigroup was down 1.6 per cent to $39.07.Mr Fogel added that even though “everybody hates bank stocks, the country cannot move forward without banks”.Eleven companies on the S&P 500, including Google, will announce earnings this week. In the financial sector, Capital One and Progressive are due to release reports on Thursday. Analysts estimate that companies included in the S&P 500 index will post average earnings growth of 13 per cent from a year earlier, the lowest increase in two years.On the technology front, Cisco Systems, the networking gear company, was up 1.1 per cent at $15.60 following news that it could eliminate as many as 10,000 jobs, almost 14 per cent of its workforce, to boost profit growth.However, Microchip Technology, the semiconductor maker, plunged 12 per cent at $33 dragging the sector down after the company cut its fiscal first-quarter guidance, results they attributed to challenges in its automotive business tied to the devastating Japan earthquake.News Corp was in the spotlight again. Its shares closed 0.12 per cent lower at $16.80 following news that Rupert Murdoch’s media group had started a $5bn stock repurchase scheme.The embattled company’s shares dropped more than 7 per cent in the previous session and have wiped out nearly $7bn in market value since July 5, with the UK phone-hacking scandal compromising its chances of a successful takeover of the 61 per cent of BSkyB that it does not own.The May US trade deficit grew 15 per cent to $50.2bn, exceeding forecasts by economists.According to commerce department figures released on Tuesday, this was the biggest change since October 2008.“This was really unexpected, all of the economists came nowhere close,” said Mr Fogel.

It said chip foundries had turned more cautious because of a fall in utilisation rates.There was a risk that the warnings would trigger contagion across other electronics markets and geographies, said Exane BNP Paribas. In particular, it saw signs that Chinese demand had weakened since early June. Even if the negative newsflow was caused by excess inventory rather than weakening demand, clearing the stockpiles might take up to a year and corporate guidance for the current quarter was likely to disappoint, Exane said.Arm, whose interim earnings are due on July 26, fell 4.9 per cent to 596½p on a generally poor day for technology investors.CSR retreated 2.9 per cent to 308p and Logica fell 2.8 per cent to 123¼p after weaker than expected numbers from India’s Infosys.Misys lost 2.8 per cent to 402p, having traded as low as 386¼p in early deals amid theories that FIS Global had abandoned plans to bid for the software maker.Traders said the talk did not appear to have any foundation.The wider market closed down but off its session lows with the FTSE 100 losing 1 per cent, or 60.20 points, to 5,868.96. The drop gave the index its sharpest three-day fall since March.Sovereign bond volatility continued to drive financial stocks lower with Barclays down 2.7 per cent to 227½p and Lloyds Banking Group off 2.2 per cent to 43¾p.“Assuming sovereign defaults in Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the major quoted European banks are cheap,” said RBS. “This is not true if we also add Spain or Italy or any of the other major European countries to the list as their default would lead to widespread recapitalisation of the banks sector across Europe.”Smith & Nephew was 0.5 per cent softer at 670p after Biomet provided a drab start to the results season among the orthopaedics groups.A profit warning sent Thomas Cook slumping 28.4 per cent to 87¾p. The group said it needed to “revisit the effectiveness of our UK business model”, less than a year after restructuring the division.Tui Travel lost 7.5 per cent to 204¾p in sympathy, although brokers pointed to a reassuring trading update on June 6 from the company. Deutsche Bank said it was leaving its forecasts unchanged and advised clients to use the weakness as a chance to buy.Premier Oil slid 4.8 per cent to 413¾p after cutting its production guidance for the second time this year. The company blamed maintenance-related shutdowns in the North Sea and said the first oil from its Huntington field would likely be delayed due to financial issues at Sevan Marine, its production vessel supplier.Retailers found support ahead of Wednesday’s results. Burberry rose 1.6 per cent to £14.37 and Marks and Spencer gained 1.2 per cent to 373p. British Retail Consortium data for June showing sales up 1.5 per cent also helped the trend.Dixons Retail rose 6.1 per cent to 15½p while Kesa Electricals rallied 4.8 per cent to 143p after Investec took the stock off its “sell” list on valuation grounds.A downgrade from “buy” to “hold” from RBS sent Yule Catto, the recent subject of bid gossip, lower by 2.9 per cent to 236p.“Although one should never say never, we believe an acquisition is not very likely,” said RBS. “Yule Catto produces mainly commodity chemicals, something that most chemical companies attempt to reduce, not increase, exposure to.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up for the sixth session in a row, gaining 0.4 per cent to 10,291.26. The Nasdaq rose 0.7 per cent to 2,166.90.“We’re seeing more productivity overseas but the main thing that’s driving the market today is the Fed,” said Doug Roberts of Channelcapitalresearch.com. “They indicated that they’re going to keep rates fairly low and that’s what people are looking for. The government is the lender of last resort and as long as the stimulus programmes continue then there’s plenty of liquidity. A weaker dollar is also fuelling the whole market.”Toll Brothers, the largest luxury homebuilder in the US, surprised the market by announcing that fourth-quarter revenues would only drop 30 per cent and would come in more than $100m above analysts’ estimates. The Pennsylvania-based builder also said that net contracts for the quarter had risen 42 per cent, raising hopes that the housing market is beginning to stabilise. Shares in the group climbed 16.4 per cent to $21.41.Shares of United Parcel Service, the world’s largest package delivery service, gained 2.2 per cent to $58.07 after its chief executive, Scott Davis, told Reuters that he expected volume to grow next year and would also increase shipping rates. Last week, the group said that it was looking to emerging markets and the healthcare sector for acquisitions in order to bolster its supply-chain and freight-forwarding units.On Tuesday, FedEx, the second-largest player in the market, also forecast a rise in shipments in the run-up to Christmas as shoppers spend more money and business deliveries begin to pick up. FedEx shares were up 0.5 per cent at $82.50, leaving them 7 per cent higher this week.Oshkosh, the speciality vehicle manufacturer, said that it had received a $438m order for an additional 1,000 blast-proof trucks from the US military, sending its shares up 3.2 per cent to $40.25. The trucks are designed for use in Afghanistan, where the military can’t use the vehicles it normally deploys in Iraq because of the poor quality of the roads.Microchip Technologies gave a boost to the Nasdaq after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “neutral” and removed it from its sell list, saying the company was beginning to address gaps in its portfolio. The shares were up 1.9 per cent at $26.71.However, shares in Nucryst Pharmaceuticals surged the most on the Nasdaq on Wednesday, rising 70 per cent to $1.70 after Smith & Nephew, a medical technology company, agreed to buy the drugmaker’s assets for about $21m.The wider market also managed to shrug off a series of disappointing corporate results on Wednesday.Macy’s fell 8.1 per cent at $17.86 after the department store chain reported a third-quarter loss and gave a full-year profit forecast below expectations. However, its net loss narrowed to $35m from $44m a year earlier due to stronger sales at it Bloomingdale’s stores and online.Shares in Tyson Foods, the world’s largest meat producer, slipped 1.1 per cent to $13.04 after JPMorgan cut its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “overweight” due to increased corn and hog prices and pressure from rivals.Simmons First National, the financial holding company, priced its public offering of 2.65m common shares at a discount to their closing price on Tuesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2 per cent to 9,370.07.The jobs data capped a run of economic data which spurred rallies at the beginning of the week.“This has been probably the most important week from a data perspective in many, many months,” said Burth White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial. “We have had great numbers, first with GDP, then the ISM survey and now with the jobs report. This is the proof that the green shoots are really growing.”In spite of the rally, some traders are worried that low summer-type volumes will not sustain further gains.Trading was choppy during the week and after a dip on Wednesday, the S&P rose 2.3 per cent this week, while the Dow gained 2.2 per cent. The tech-dominated Nasdaq lagged behind slightly in the week, rising only 1.1 per cent.The technology sector lagged again on Friday after several companies reported their results. Two rival IT companies saw an improvement in orders from businesses for their services.Computer Sciences was also helped by lower costs, and its better earnings than expected boosted the shares 1.6 per cent to $49.45.But Affiliated Computer Services fell 5.1 per cent to $44.52 after it predicted lower earnings next quarter than analysts currently expect, even though it beat estimates this quarter.Microchip Technology also lost ground in spite of reporting better results than expected, dropping 1.1 per cent to $26.43.Elsewhere in the sector, VeriSign, the internet domain company, was one of the day’s steeper fallers after reporting slightly weaker revenues than expected.The company failed to reassure investors even by announcing the promotion of Mark McLaughlin from chief operating officer to chief executive, and the shares fell 9.2 per cent to $18.66.Elsewhere, financial shares were mixed on Friday, as banks initially overcame pre-market wobbles following RBS’s warning that recovery was still some way off.Citigroup rose 1.3 per cent to $3.85, and while investors pared much of its earlier gains, the stock recorded a weekly rise of 21.5 per cent.Bank of America, howver dropped 1.7 per cent to $16.42, clipping its rise this week to 11 per cent, while JPMorgan, up 4 per cent at $42.36, rallied 9.6 per cent this week.AIG performed even better than the rest of the financial sector after the bailed-out insurer reported much stronger profits than had been predicted.The company was helped by narrowing losses on its investments. The shares jumped 20.5 per cent to $27.14, and more than doubled this week.As the second-quarter earnings seasons starts winding down, shares in broadcaster CBS jumped 26.6 per cent to $10.81 on Friday, after the company swung to a profit, although its earnings were still 96 per cent lower than the same quarter last year.Leslie Moonves, the chief executive, gave further impetus to the rising share price when he said he expected earnings to be stronger next quarter.In the telecoms sector, Leap tumbled 24.5 per cent to $17.06, after reporting weak profits as new wireless internet subscribers were lower than forecast.

The shares gave up 6.8 per cent to $27.20.But Broadcom’s rival Microchip Technology found modest gains, with the shares rising 0.6 per cent to $27.03 as the company forecast better estimates and sales than analysts currently expect.Defensive stocks gave further support to the markets as investors moved into less risky areas rather than selling out of equities altogether. Consumer staples, healthcare stocks and utilities all performed well.Drug makers were particularly strong, with Johnson & Johnson rising 2.1 per cent to $61.51, while Merck picked up 2.5 per cent to $30.99.“It’s a good sign that investors are rotating their money rather than pulling it out of stocks altogether,” said Keith Walter, a portfolio manager at Artrio Global Investors. “A lot of money is still in the sidelines, and people are chasing the rally right now, so we could see it continue.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.3 per cent at 979.26.The Dow advanced further above the 9,000 level, which it topped on Thursday for the first time since the beginning of the year, rising 0.3 per cent to 9,093.24.The tech-heavy Nasdaq suffered, however, declining 0.4 per cent to 1,965.96.All three were up between 3.9 and 4.3 per cent on the week, following a series of encouraging earnings announcements.This extended last week’s stellar gains as the majority of large companies beat profit expectations.There was optimism from the credit card sector on Friday, as both American Express and Capital One beat earnings expectations in spite of continuing worries about credit write-offs.AmEx saw uncollectible loans reach a record level, but its relatively strong earnings saw the shares close 0.2 per cent higher at $29.51.Its rival Capital One picked up 8.1 per cent to $30.07 as impressive revenues helped the company make a narrower loss than expected.Online retailer Amazon added to a gloomy morning, reporting disappointing revenues and falling 7.9 per cent to $86.49.The company’s shares took part in the broad market rally on Thursday, helped by the news that it would expand into the clothing sector by purchasing online shoe retailer Zappos.com.Elsewhere, Schlumberger, the energy company, beat expectations with both its profits and revenues, but warned that it did not expect any rebound in sales this year. Its shares fell 0.7 per cent to $57.34.“The disappointing results at Microsoft and Amazon highlight the market may be too optimistic about a sustained rally,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.But he added: “Going into month end, players are likely to buy dips.”

Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gained 4.4 per cent to $58.96 while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, advanced 3.5 per cent to $11.15.Steel makers were also helped by rising metals prices, as well as analysis by Morgan Stanley, which upgraded shares in US Steel and AK Steel but downgraded those of larger rival Nucor.Shares in US Steel rose 7.9 per cent to $37.82 and AK Steel jumped 9.8 per cent to $19.10. Nucor’s gains were limited to 2.1 per cent at $47.76.But the strength in materials stocks was countered by weakness from the consumer sector, where Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer company, warned that the short-term environment remained challenging. P&G’s shares dropped 1.4 per cent to $52.41.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent up at 942.43, close to its highest finish of the year, and the Nasdaq Composite index finished 1 per cent higher at 1,860.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a fraction lower at 8,763.06.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford, said investors were looking at the dollar and commodities prices for signs of inflation to interpret the future direction of interest rates.“The market can only focus on one thing at once, and all week that has been whether interest rates will rise,” she said.Texas Instruments provided a boost for the technology sector after the microchip manufacturer said demand for its products would drive second-quarter sales and profits higher than previously forecast. The shares gained 6.3 per cent to $21.02.Bank of America added to the optimism in the sector when it said Microchip Technology‘s orders from China had improved, causing the bank to raise its price target on the company to $23. Microchip Technology’s shares picked up
6 per cent to $23.07.Other microchip manufacturers also benefited. Texas’s larger rival Intel advanced 3.1 per cent to $16.42 while Applied Materials gained 1.6 per cent to $11.03.News that the government will allow 10 of the country’s largest banks to repay a total of $68bn from the troubled asset relief programme failed to give the sector a lift, even though banks that repay the money will free themselves of some government involvement in matters such as hiring and executive pay.Several banks confirmed that they were on the list and some said they planned to repay the money soon. Morgan Stanley said it would repay its $10bn infusion in full but its shares fell 1.3 per cent to $30.98.Capital One, the credit card company, said it expected to repay its Tarp money “within weeks” and its shares rose 2.6 per cent to $24.05. American Express said it had also received approval, and its stock gained 5 per cent to $26.93.US Bancorp lost 0.9 per cent to $18.18 after it said it would also repay Tarp money but that the process of doing so would cost the bank $153m in second-quarter earnings.Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, said: “Financial stocks have been held back by the threat of inflation. We are seeing the negative effects of too much good economic news.”Some of the positive effect on financial stocks from the Tarp news was also damped by the congressional panel overseeing the Tarp process, which said the stress tests should be repeated on tougher terms.BlackRock continued its gains of the previous session as the company closed in on the purchase of Barclays Global Investors for a sum of $12bn-$13bn to create the world’s biggest money manager.The purchase would mean BlackRock has beaten off late competition for the unit from Bank of New York Mellon, and the company’s shares lifted 7.6 per cent to $182.14.BoNYM’s shares climbed 0.9 per cent to $28.79, as it confirmed it was also on the list of those allowed to repay Tarp funds."
21;MCHP;Microchip Technology;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Microchip in $2.3bn offer for Atmel;;Microchip Technology made an unsolicited proposal on Thursday to buy Atmel for $2.3bn in cash, which it would partially finance by selling several of Atmel’s lines of business to rival ON Semiconductor.Microchip is offering to pay $5 per share for Atmel, which makes special-purpose computers called microcontrollers along with analog and digital processors, memory chips and wireless chips.It would meld Atmel’s microcontroller business into its own operations, which build electronic components for a range of industries including the communications and automotive sectors.Microchip said ON Semiconductor would buy the assets of Atmel’s non-volatile memory, radio frequency and automotive businesses for an undisclosed amount before the deal closed.Microchip would aim to sell Atmel’s application-specific integrated circuit business at that time or soon after, potentially to an unnamed third party that has already expressed interest.Atmel said its board of directors would review the bid, which represents a 52 per cent premium to Atmel’s most recent closing share price but is about 15 cents lower than the price at which its shares traded a year ago.Shares in Atmel rallied 25 per cent to $4.10 by midday on Thursday.The average deal premia that acquirers have offered US targets in the first nine months of this year jumped to 32.2 per cent versus 24.4 per cent in the same period last year, according to Dealogic.Sagging share prices of targets account for some of that widening spread but dealmakers also attribute it to acquirers’ views that sellers will not yet accept lower prices for their shares because they feel the losses will be short-lived.Steven Laub, Atmel chief executive, met with Steve Sanghi, his Microchip counterpart, on September 5 to discuss a takeover by Microchip but the meeting did not lead to negotiations.Microchip made its offer public in an attempt to push a deal forward but said its bid was subject to due diligence and negotiations over the financing that ON Semiconductor would require.California-based Atmel fought off a proposal last spring from George Perlegos, its former chief executive, to replace its board of directors.The dissidents’ board nominees had proposed to sell or close several Atmel units including its automotive business, buy back shares, and appoint a new chief.Atmel has said it is focusing on its microcontroller operations and it has sold several non-core assets in recent months. But Microchip said Atmel’s microcontroller operating margins still lagged its own.

elevated long-term bond yields, higher oil prices and the exposure of financial stocks to hedge funds.Not even the successful trading debut for Blackstone, the first private equity firm to list on an exchange, could dispel the bearish gloom.Blackstone began trading at $36.45 a share, about 17 per cent higher than its placement price of $31. The stock closed at $35.06.As a tough week ebbed to a close, the S&P 500 index fell 1.3 per cent to finish at 1,502.66 for a decline of 2 per cent since Monday.Investors on Friday were also mindful that the S&P 500 index and other benchmarks faced a shake-up in their composition. The S&P removed three stocks, PMC Sierra, ADC Telecom and Sanmina-SCI - all technology companies. As from next week, they will be replaced by Tyco Electronics and Covidien, two companies spun off by Tyco, while Discover Financial Services, a spin-off from Morgan Stanley, will also join the S&P.The Russell indexes were also rebalanced on Friday, and that sparked some choppy trading ahead of the close said traders.Among the leading S&P sector groups that led losses, utilities was down 4.4 per cent, healthcare was lower by 3 per cent and financials was off 2.9 per cent for the week.Real estate investment trusts and homebuilders also fell sharply this week.The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1 per cent to close at 2,588.96 yesterday for a fall of 1.4 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4 per cent to 13,360.26 for a slide of 2 per cent this week.Interest-rate sensitive stocks were hurt as the yield on the 10-year bond consolidated near recent highs.Of greater concern for the financial sector, however, was a shake-out at two mortgage hedge funds owned by Bear Stearns.Investors wondered if the episode marked the start of further problems as various banks sought to sell collateral and limit their losses to the hedge funds.Analysts at S&P said: “Recent developments underscore the market and credit risks borne by the major broker dealers as a consequence of their hedge fund investments. This is a sector-wide phenomenon that warrants close scrutiny.”Late on Friday, Bear Stearns was 1.4 per cent lower at $143.75, for a loss of 4.2 per cent this week. The American stock exchange’s Broker/Dealer index declined 1.8 per cent on Friday, for a loss of 3.6 per cent this week.The bearish mood in stocks was also a function of concern over earnings and the economy.“The market is currently a little nerve-wrecking for investors,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global market strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank.He said investors were worried that it was becoming harder for the economy to reflect a “goldilocks mix” whereby growth slows to stall inflation but remains strong enough to keep corporate profit humming along.Meanwhile, more professional investors are betting that stocks will suffer the summer blues.For the month of June, the number of short-selling positions on NYSE rose 6 per cent to 12.47bn shares, a record high.One bright spot this week was a rebound in deal activity after a drought early last week.Nuveen Investments agreed to a $5.75bn private equity buy-out and shares in the investment manager jumped 15.1 per cent to $62.83.Genesco rose 6 er cent to $52.57 this week after Finish Line, down 19.8 per cent at $10.13, agreed to acquire the footwear and accessories retailer.Luxottica rose 3.9 per cent at $37.15 as the Italian eyeware maker bought Oakley, a US rival, in a $2.1bn cash deal valued at $29.30 a share.

Shares rose 14.5 per cent to $29.06 this week.Semiconductor stocks were in the spotlight this week. Microchip Technology slid 10.1 per cent to $37.80 after the chipmaker cut its sales outlook.Other chipmakers fared better however, with an upgrade for Advanced Micro Devices boosting the stock 6.9 per cent to $14.57.Nvidia traded at an all-time high of $43.35 on a split-adjusted basis as the graphics chip maker revealed a new family of processors. The stock rose 10.3 per cent to $43.62.Earnings and warnings sparked activity in a number of stocks this week.Andersons, an ethanol and grain producer, rose 8.8 per cent to $45.60 after the company increased its full-year profit forecast.Sonic, the restaurant group, lowered its fiscal fourth-quarter outlook due to higher prices for dairy and soybean oil and rising labour costs. Its shares fell 11.6 per cent to $21.48.Best Buy and Circuit City, the electronic retailers, provided disappointing earnings and their shares fell 6.2 per cent to $44.79 and 5.1 per cent to $15.85, respectively.Another stock in the news this week was Kraft Foods.

Kraft was up 2.9 per cent for the week at $36.32 at the close of trade on Friday."
23;MCHP;Microchip Technology;2007-06-19T22:16:43Z;Wall St edges higher as bond yields fall;;Wall Street edged higher on Tuesday, while bond yields fell sharply and investors sifted disappointing earnings news from the retail and semiconductor sectors, a massive stock buy-back at Expedia and a management shuffle at Yahoo.Housing starts data for May declined 2.1 per cent against an expected fall of 3.5 per cent. The report briefly pressure home builder stocks, but the S&P homebuilders index ultimately rose 0.1 per cent, trimming its loss for the year to 21.4 per cent.“Housing starts confirm that homebuilders have become more pessimistic over the last two months,’’ said economists at Lehman Brothers. “Next week’s sales data will tell us if that was warranted.’’The S&P 500 index closed 0.2 per cent firmer at 1,533.70. Stocks had spent much of on Tuesday flirting with a negative close, only to stave off that outcome when yields fell to their lows of the day in late trade. The yield on the 10-year bond fell seven basis points to 5.07 per cent. At this juncture, analysts say yields are not high enough to spark a large move out of equities.“Fixed income does not represent a major value opportunity relative to equities, in our view,” said Vinay Pande, chief investment advisor at Deutsche Bank. But he said the recent rise in bond yields means “that the large tailwind equities had from very attractive funding has now dissipated materially”.Among the 10 main industry groups in the S&P, industrials and telecoms closed higher. Consumer staples and technology stocks led declines.The Nasdaq Composite closed a fraction higher at 2,626.76.Within the technology sector, semiconductor stocks were in the spotlight. Microchip Technology slid 9 per cent to $37.91, after the semiconductor maker cut its sales outlook for the first quarter ending June 30.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 13,635.42. A bright spot for blue chips was General Electric, which hit a five-year high of $39.60 and closed up 3.2 per cent at $39.29.Among stocks in the news on Tuesday was Yahoo, down 1.7 per cent at $27.63 as investors reacted to the news that Jerry Yang, co-founder of the company, had been appointed chief executive. He will replace Terry Semel.“Over the past six months Yahoo has now seen two major restructurings and experienced sizable management turnover. Without a single wholly new principal announced, we don’t necessarily see major changes,” said Scott Kessler, internet software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Shares in Best Buy slumped 5.9 per cent to $45.18 as its first-quarter earnings fell 18 per cent and the retailer lowered guidance for 2008. Shares in other electronic retailers fell on Tuesday.

Shareholders in both exchanges meet on July 9 to vote on approving the merger.
24;MCHP;Microchip Technology;2007-05-29T10:53:01Z;NEC and value traps;;"Despite being spun off from its parent four years ago, NEC Electronics is – literally – a chip off the old block. The Japanese semiconductor company has underperformed since the initial public offering, and the share price now stands at roughly two-thirds the IPO price-tag. Now two US funds are trying to salvage value from the $3bn company, urging parent NEC Corp to sell down its 70 per cent stake to facilitate restructuring.Disappointingly, and particularly given its own problems with the tax authorities, NEC Corp is turning a deaf ear to their pleas. It can ill afford to do so: NEC Electronics expects to rack up its third year of pre-tax losses this year, and watched sales slide for three years on the trot from 2003. Peers’ valuations leave it in the shade: NEC Electronics trades at roughly 0.5 times forward sales and less than 4 times enterprise value to forward earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. That compares with, say, Microchip Technology of the US, which trades on 7 times forward sales and 14 times ev/ebitda. Closer to home, the ailing Sanyo Electronics is poised to sell its semiconductor operations for an estimated Y200bn, representing one times sales.As the US funds point out, NEC Electronics should easily be able to achieve a higher valuation. The chipmaker’s reluctance to part with the more commoditised products – which could easily be outsourced to Taiwanese foundries – creates a cash drain. In the past three years, NEC Electronics has spent more than 17 per cent of sales on research and development ,and almost the same again on capital expenditure. Admittedly, those figures are bloated by the shrinking sales denominator; but they are comfortably ahead of the competition. Some divisions appear to exist solely to serve NEC Corp, or make chips catering to a very limited audience. That makes it another classic Japanese value trap – and another reason why investors will think twice before putting money into the world’s number two stock market."
