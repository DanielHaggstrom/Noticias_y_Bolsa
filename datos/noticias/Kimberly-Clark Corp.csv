0;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-02-02T17:47:51Z;Consumer brands boost US ad spending to win back shoppers;Super Bowl showcases ramp-up of budgets for some products following years of restraint;Some of the world’s best known brands are once again aggressively expanding their advertising spend to win back shoppers, after years of restrictions imposed on the marketing budgets of global consumer goods groups.Executives have in recent days disclosed to investors the scale of the promotional push.Among the many companies ramping up ad spend are Kimberly-Clark, maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, and Colgate-Palmolive, the toothpaste and soap group. Each spent an additional $100m on advertising last year.A showcase for how some of the enlarged budgets are being deployed in the US will come during this weekend’s Super Bowl, long known as much for its commercial breaks as for the American football game itself.Hershey, whose fourth-quarter advertising and marketing spend in North America rose 5.1 per cent compared with a year ago, will have its first Super Bowl ad in over a decade with a slot for Reese’s chocolate bar.America’s most-watched sporting fixture will also have spots for Procter & Gamble’s Olay skincare brand, featuring an all-female cast of astronauts, PepsiCo’s Mountain Dew, which spoofs the horror movie “The Shining”, and Heinz ketchup, with a split-screen piece directed by Roman Coppola.Analysts said it remained to be seen whether the increased promotion of established staples would be enough to woo back shoppers who have defected to new products and cheaper alternatives developed by retailers.The upswing in ad spend, both online and in some traditional media, follows a period of cost cutting by several multinational consumer goods groups to protect profitability.Eight of the sector’s biggest companies tracked by media buying agency GroupM spent a combined $34.5bn on advertising in 2018, equivalent to about 12 per cent of revenues. Yet the proportion changed little over a five-year period despite expansion into growth areas such as China, pointing to cuts in the US and other mature markets.For critics, the dangers of tightened budgets were exposed last year when Kraft Heinz took a $15bn writedown to reflect gloomier prospects for some of its best-known products.“Many packaged goods companies aggressively reduced their spending on advertising in recent years,” said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM, the media buying agency. “After the Kraft Heinz blow up last year, it may be that some companies felt liberated. Those who believed in investing in growth felt like they won the argument.”Kimberly-Clark’s additional ad spend in 2019 was the biggest annual increase as a proportion of its revenues in at least two decades, according to Barclays.Mike Hsu, Kimberly-Clark’s chief executive, told analysts that the company had “trimmed back a little bit” of its advertising spending during what had been “a tough couple of years”.Now the $49bn-market cap group was willing to invest again as market conditions were “very good for growth”.Colgate-Palmolive on Friday disclosed that advertising spending rose 6.5 per cent in 2019 to $1.69bn.Church & Dwight, the group behind Arm & Hammer baking soda and Trojan condoms, also on Friday said its fourth-quarter marketing expenses rose 29 per cent from a year ago to $163m.Advertising is not the only activity enjoying more generous budgets. Cadbury’s owner Mondelez said an additional $150m it invested in the business last year was focused on distribution and logistics, as well as marketing.Executives said they were closely monitoring the higher ad spend and focusing on resources on consumer-facing campaigns that clearly deliver results. Mondelez has consolidated its use of advertising agencies, focusing on WPP and Publicis.Kraft Heinz, which last year installed Miguel Patricio — a marketing executive from brewer AB InBev — as its chief executive, has said it will increase its consumer-facing advertising budget in 2020 but will keep a tight rein on agency fees and market research.Despite Kimberly-Clark’s recent budget increases, Lauren Lieberman, analyst at Barclays, estimated that the company was still spending less on advertising than it was in 2012. The degree to which the higher spending would boost the company’s revenues, she said, was yet to be demonstrated.
1;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2019-04-22T16:14:49Z;Kimberly-Clark jumps the most since 2008 after forecast-beating result;;Kimberly-Clark shares were eyeing their biggest one-day jump since the financial crisis as the Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies maker reported a smaller-than-expected decline in sales and adjusted earnings and stuck with its outlook for the full year.Rising commodity costs and a stronger dollar were headwinds and volumes continued to decline during the first quarter, but the Dallas-based company managed to partially offset those impacts with higher prices for its tissues and line of workplace-oriented products, as well as $115m of cost savings.Up 6.2 per cent to a 22-month high of $131.165 in mid-morning trade on Monday, shares were on track for their biggest one-day gain since October 2008.Announcing the company would stick with its previous full-year forecasts — for a 1 per cent to 2 per cent decline in net sales and adjusted earnings of $6.50 to $6.70 a share — chief executive Mike Hsu said he was “encouraged with our first-quarter results” and that the group “made excellent progress driving higher selling prices to help offset commodity and currency headwinds.”Sales in the three months ended March 31 fell 2 per cent from a year ago to $4.63bn, hurt by foreign exchange effects, but the result was better than the median forecast of $4.54bn among analysts in a Refinitiv survey. Organic sales, which strip out the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, were up 3 per cent over the past 12 months, driven primarily by developing and emerging markets.Kimberly-Clark saw net selling prices increase across all of its major segments, with the biggest increases coming from its consumer tissue and K-C Professional units.That trickled down to diluted net income of $1.31 a share, compared with 26 cents a year ago when they company incurred charges associated with its global restructuring plan. Adjusted earnings of $1.66 a share were down 3 per cent from a year ago, but encouraged investors by coming in 12 cents higher than market forecasts.
2;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Albert J Dunlap, business executive, 1937-2019;The asset stripper who was hailed by Wall Street as ‘Chainsaw Al’;When Sunbeam announced in 1996 that it had hired Al Dunlap to run the all-American appliance maker behind Grillmaster barbecues, its shares shot up 52 per cent — one of the largest one-day jumps the New York Stock Exchange had ever seen.Six years later, Sunbeam had declared bankruptcy and the superstar chief executive hailed as corporate America’s greatest turnround artist was settling civil fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC alleged that accounting tricks had concealed Sunbeam’s financial problems. Dunlap paid a $500,000 civil penalty and was barred from ever running a public company again.That came as a relief to a generation of middle managers, who had seen the man Wall Street hailed as “Chainsaw Al”, “Rambo in Pinstripes” or “The Shredder” rip through the workforces he was put in charge of, relishing every of-the-era nickname he accumulated in his pursuit of pumped-up profits.“If you want to be liked,” he was fond of saying, “get a dog”. Until he died of prostate cancer last week, aged 81, he and his wife, Judith Stringer, kept two German shepherds.Don Zakarin, who represented Dunlap through four years of investor lawsuits, was among the humans who did not like him, even as he still maintains that his former client was ignorant of any fraud. He was “a very difficult, demanding and unappreciative client”, the lawyer said, recalling a day when he was preparing the intemperate fallen idol for his SEC deposition.“He would say things like, ‘If you were any kind of a lawyer this case would be over’ . . . I said to him calmly, ‘Al, let’s just continue to work. I don’t want you to say this again’.”When Dunlap continued, Mr Zakarin gave him a warning: “I said, ‘If you say it again I’m coming over the table at you.’ About an hour later he said it again and I came over the table at him. I chased him around the room.” Another lawyer intervened and Mr Zakarin never caught the former high school football champion.Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1937, Albert J Dunlap graduated from West Point, the military academy, and had his first management experience running a nuclear missile site in the 1960s. His industry career, starting at the US group Kimberly-Clark, appeared conventional enough until the 1980s, when James Goldsmith spotted his potential as a coldly effective hatchet man.The Anglo-French corporate raider hired him after seeing him shake up companies such as Lily-Tulip, a disposable cup maker whose stock rose 900 per cent on his watch. They shared a disdain for what they dubbed “corpocracy” — complacent companies run for the benefit of bureaucrats rather than investors.It has become common for CEOs to talk about their employees, consumers and communities in the same breath as their shareholders, but Dunlap had no time for anyone without capital on the line. “The most ridiculous term heard in boardrooms today is stakeholders,” he roared. “How much did they pay for their stake?”For a while, his ruthlessness was seductive. The Australian media magnate Kerry Packer hired him to run Consolidated Press Holdings, then in 1994 he was headhunted to run a lossmaking Philadelphia toilet roll company, Scott Paper. He fired one-third of its people and within two years had sold it to Kimberly-Clark for more than double the valuation he inherited.He left Scott with $100m, saying he was the best bargain in corporate America. “I think he came to believe his own headlines,” Mr Zakarin said, adding that he respected what his client had achieved, more through drive than brilliance.Challenged on CNN about the 11,000 jobs he cut at Scott, Dunlap explained his credo: “I think the real issue is I saved 65 per cent of the jobs. If someone like me had not come in, 100 per cent of the people would have lost their jobs.”A generous philanthropist who believed sports had taught him to endure adversity, Dunlap inspired similar self-belief in college athletes with his mantra that “the only barrier in life is the one you put there”, according to Eric Carr of the Seminole Boosters, the fundraising arm of Florida State University’s athletics programme, to which Dunlap donated $40m.His turnround at Scott remained his great point of pride in his retirement, which he spent on a Florida farm with scores of “spoiled rotten” rescued horses, llamas and other animals, Mr Carr says. The two men became close friends over the past 14 years, he added. They never once discussed Sunbeam.
3;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2019-01-23T19:34:36Z;P&G overcomes rising cost pressures with price increases;Consumer goods group’s bullish outlook contrasts with woes at Kimberly-Clark;Procter & Gamble’s plan to raise prices and refresh its product line-up appeared to be bearing early fruit, according to its latest quarterly results on Wednesday, as cost pressures continue to challenge the consumer goods industry.The maker of Head & Shoulders shampoo, Dawn detergent and Olay moisturisers raised its financial targets for 2019, in a bullish outlook statement that contrasted with that of its industry rival, Kimberly-Clark.Better than expected earnings from P&G sent its shares up almost 4 per cent, but Kimberly-Clark disappointed Wall Street with figures that missed analyst forecasts. Both companies have long been grappling with rapidly shifting shopper tastes, the rise of upstart rivals and changes in advertising markets, and commodity cost inflation has added to the pressure more recently.Kimberly-Clark’s new chief executive Mike Hsu said on Wednesday that the market remained “challenging”. P&G’s finance director Jon Moeller similarly said the company was facing a “very difficult, and competitive” landscape.However, P&G eked out a 4 per cent rise in organic sales in its second quarter. The company has raised prices on several products. It is also launching new products including new Gillette razors for men with sensitive skin and making “formula and packaging upgrades” on products such as Head & Shoulders.Beauty product sales led the way in the group’s fiscal second quarter, up 8 per cent on an organic basis compared with a year earlier, while healthcare products rose 5 per cent. Grooming sales were a weak spot, however, with organic sales down 3 per cent.Pricing is on the rise and there are signs that structure and cultural changes are being implementedNet income rose 26 per cent from a year ago to $3.21bn, due mainly to business tax cuts.On the back of the results the Cincinnati-based group said it now expected organic sales to rise between 2 and 4 per cent for fiscal 2019. It increased the top end of the range one percentage point from previous guidance issued three months ago.“The combination of stronger than expected organic sales growth and productivity-driven cost savings are offsetting a significantly larger challenge from foreign exchange and commodity costs than we originally anticipated,” Mr Moeller said.In contrast, full-year earnings from Kimberly-Clark sent its stock down more than 3 per cent by late morning in New York. The maker of Kleenex tissues, Huggies nappies and Andrex toilet roll showed restructuring charges pushed net income 38 per cent lower from a year ago, to $1.44bn in 2018. In notes to clients, analysts at Berenberg said Kimberly-Clark’s earnings showed there was “no let-up from the input cost pressures” but that execution at P&G is improving. “Pricing is on the rise and there are signs that structure and cultural changes are being implemented.”Kimberly-Clark was particularly hard hit by the rising costs of pulp used in a wide range of its products. The company cited a $795m “drag” from commodity expenses in 2018. Net sales ticked up 1 per cent to $18.5bn.The company cautioned net sales were expected to slide between 1 and 2 per cent this year. Mr Hsu, who replaced longtime chief executive Thomas Falk this month, laid down a “strategic plan” to help combat anaemic sales which, although light on detail, included promises to push into ecommerce and improve supply chains.Mr Hsu said the plan aimed to “deliver balanced and sustainable growth and to create shareholder value in what is assumed to be a continued challenging environment”. Last year, the Dallas-based company said it would cut at least 5,000 jobs to help reduce costs by as much as $550m by the end of 2021.Mr Hsu said he was targeting growth on organic basis of between 1 and 3 per cent in the longer term.
4;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2018-11-17T15:37:59Z;Kimberly-Clark to call off European tissue sale;Sale attracted some private equity interest but offers were well below $1.2bn target;Kimberly-Clark has decided to call off the sale of its European tissue business, which includes popular household loo roll brand Andrex, after the unit fetched far less than $1.2bn price tag it hoped to get.According to people close to the situation, the US group is expected to call off the auction process this weekend. The sale attracted interest from private equity firm Centerbridge Partners and a consortium bid from Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and PAI Partners.One person close to the process said the Goldman consortium initially bid around $1.4bn for the unit but then substantially lowered its offer to below $900m, citing a number of factors including the turbulence Britain’s exit from the EU.Both groups had been shortlisted for the final round of the multi-month sale process.The Goldman group had recruited Giles Turrell, the former boss of cereals group Weetabix, to help with its offer, people close to the process previously told the Financial Times.Kimberly-Clark did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Besides Andrex in the UK and Ireland, brands in Kimberly-Clark’s European business include Hakle in Austria and Switzerland and Scottex in Belgium, Italy and Spain.The sale process was prompted by Kimberly-Clark’s desire to exit less profitable businesses.Kimberly-Clark declined to comment.
5;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2018-10-22T12:20:33Z;Kimberly-Clark chief to step down after 16 years;Change comes amid pressure from changing tastes, intense competition and rising costs;Kimberly-Clark’s chief executive is standing aside after 16 years leading the maker of Kleenex tissues, Huggies nappies and Andrex toilet roll — and in the middle of a restructuring.Thomas Falk, 60, has been chief executive since 2002 and chairman since 2003. He will be replaced as CEO by Mike Hsu, chief operating officer, from January and will stay on as executive chairman to ease the transition.The change at the top comes at a time when the consumer goods industry is under pressure from rapidly changing tastes, intense competition and rising costs. Earlier this year, the company said it would cut at least 5,000 jobs as part of plans to reduce expenses by as much as $550m.Mr Falk led the spin off of Kimberly-Clark’s US-based healthcare business in 2014. Its shares have approximately doubled during his tenure, giving the company a market capitalisation of $38bn.More recently, however, the company has been hurt by factors from the rise of ecommerce to higher commodity costs. A declining birth rate, which has reduced demand for nappies, has added to the pressure. Shares have lost 11 per cent this year.Mike [Hsu] is the right leader to build on Kimberly-Clark’s proud historyIn the third quarter, net sales fell 2 per cent from a year ago to $4.58bn while net income dropped from $579m to $462m, hurt by charges related to the restructuring, as well as higher input costs.Maria Henry, chief financial officer, said commodity inflation had been “significant” during the third quarter, including for pulp and other raw materials.The company said the results had also been dented by foreign exchange movements. Gains in developing markets led a 1 per cent organic sales improvement.Like its rivals including Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, which is based in Dallas, is trying to offset some of the pressures caused by input cost inflation by raising prices. In the summer, it said it was increasing average prices in North America by mid-to-high single digits for a range of products including Cottonelle bathroom tissue and Viva paper towels.Net selling prices grew 1 per cent in the third quarter. Rosie Edwards, analyst at Berenberg, said the period was “under-whelming”. The performance “failed to live up to expectations — particularly on pricing, where a more dramatic improvement was expected, and margin.”Ian Read, the Pfizer chief executive who is Kimberly-Clark’s lead director, said in a statement: “We thank and recognise Tom for his incredible leadership . . . During his tenure, Kimberly-Clark transformed into one of the world’s leading consumer products companies and delivered significant growth and shareholder value.”He added: “Mike is the right leader to build on Kimberly-Clark’s proud history.”
6;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2018-08-19T16:03:15Z;US companies push rising costs on to customers;Price inflation has been a recurring theme of US second-quarter earnings briefings;Blue-chip US companies are confident they can pass on rising costs to their customers and protect record profit margins as inflationary pressure is offset by buoyant business and consumer sentiment.Cost inflation has been a recurring theme of US second-quarter earnings announcements from companies in industries as diverse as retail and industrial equipment. Executives have pointed to a combination of higher freight and labour costs with increased prices for raw materials, some of which has been driven by the Trump administration’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, and by other countries’ retaliatory tariffs on US goods. This was largely offset in the quarter by a robust economy however, boosted by last December’s tax reforms and a strong employment market. “I think there is, overall, very little pushback on price increases,” Michael Larson, chief financial officer of Illinois Tool Works, told a Jefferies conference earlier this month. The price increases stemming from rising raw material costs and tariff effects were “well understood” by customers, he said, and underlying demand remained strong, allowing the company to offset higher costs with increased pricing “dollar for dollar”. Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, also pointed to a strong US economy providing support for price increases at a retailer known for its low-price focus. “Customers tell us that they feel better about the current health of the US economy as well as their personal finances,” he told analysts last week. 2.8%US core producer price rise in year to July 2018Companies that have announced price increases include Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, Stanley Black & Decker and Whirlpool, but not all have yet taken effect. Caterpillar told investors that its price increases came into effect on July and should offset the “material” cost increases and tariff impacts it expects in the second half of the year. Kimberly-Clark said it would raise the price of brands such as Kleenex and Huggies by mid- to high-single digits early next year, to offset higher commodity costs. Newell Brands, the company behind consumer products from Rubbermaid containers to Sharpie pens, announced higher pricing in anticipation of tariffs that could cost it $100m a year, but Michael Polk, its CEO, cautioned: “We don’t know yet how much of the pricing will stick.”The ability to pass on higher costs has allowed companies to protect and in many cases boost their profit margins. “Following the best earnings season since 2010, S&P 500 profit margins have now risen to an all-time high,” Goldman Sachs analysts noted. Second-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 index are on track to increase 24.6 per cent from the same period of last year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Goldman cautioned, however, that margin growth is likely to slow, as the “tailwinds” of tax cuts fade, global growth moderates and wage pressures and interest rates both rise. ADP recorded US wage growth of 3 per cent in the second quarter, and core producer prices rose 0.3 per cent month-on-month in July to stand 2.8 per cent above their level a year earlier.A weak reading on Friday from the University of Michigan’s preliminary consumer sentiment survey for August has raised questions about sensitivity to rising prices, particularly among poorer consumers, with the report’s chief economist saying that the fall-off in favourable price perceptions it found was “much larger than ever before recorded”. Tariffs have led to price rises in double quick time / From Bradley Lucier, West Lafayette, IN, US
7;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2018-08-15T18:28:23Z;Kleenex maker Kimberly-Clark rises on price increases;;The prospect of costlier Kleenex tissues, Huggies nappies and Cottonelle toilet paper is giving Wall Street a reason to stock up on Kimberly-Clark shares on Wednesday.The Dallas-based company’s shares were up 4 per cent to $115.56, on track for their best one-day gain in two weeks, after it informed US and Canadian customers that it is planning to raise net selling prices across a majority of its North America consumer products business.The increases will generally run in the mid- to high-single digits and primarily impact products like Cottonelle and Scott 1000 bathroom tissue, Kleenex tissues, Viva paper towels, Huggies nappies and Pull-Ups training pants, the company said. Most will take effect in the first quarter of 2019, while Cottonelle and Viva products will see prices increase in the fourth quarter of 2018.The moves “are necessary to help offset significant commodity cost inflation”, Kimberly-Clark said in a statement on Wednesday.The company had flagged last month that rising input costs could dent its profits, in the latest sign of price pressures spreading across the US economy. It raised its forecast for inflation in “key input costs” to come in between $675m and $775m, up from $400m to $550m, which it said reflected “higher assumptions for pulp costs in particular, and secondarily other raw materials.”Kimberly-Clark’s move comes just weeks after rival Procter & Gamble said it would raise prices on a slew of household products like nappies, toilet paper and kitchen towels, on the back of commodity price increases that have been exacerbated by trade tariffs.After rising 5.7 per cent in 2017, Kimberly-Clark is down 4.14 per cent so far this year, versus the 5.2 per cent advance posted by the broader S&P 500.
8;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2018-07-24T12:47:17Z;Kleenex maker Kimberly-Clark warns on rising input costs;;Kimberly-Clark, the US company behind Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, has warned that rising input costs will hit its profits, in the latest sign of effects of price pressures across the American economy.The group said on Tuesday that for 2018, it now expects inflation in “key input costs” to come in between $675m and $775m, up from its previous estimate of between $400m and $550m.Kimberly-Clark said its new forecast reflects “higher assumptions for pulp costs in particular, and secondarily other raw materials.”Overall US producer prices were up 3.4 per cent in June from the same month in 2017, the most rapid growth since November 2011, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Price pressures have been boosted by several factors, economists have said recently. Economic growth has been strong, and is expected to have reached an annual rate of 4 per cent in the second quarter. At the same time, a booming labour market has also added to the pick-up in prices. The mounting trade battle being fought by the US, the EU and China has also caused increases in certain industries.Kimberly-Clark said greater than expected cost savings from a global restructuring programme and cost-cutting scheme would help dull the blow from the higher costs. Still, adjusted operating profits are now expected to fall by between 2 and 5 per cent this year, from a previous estimate of growth of 2 to 5 per cent.Net sales for the full year may also take a hit from a recent jump in the US dollar. Foreign currency fluctuations are now expected to have a neutral to negative 1 percentage point impact on sales growth, whereas they were previously expected to be a positive of between 1 and 2 points.The more subdued forecast pushed the group’s shares down by 2.7 per cent in pre-market trading in New York.Thomas Falk, chief executive, said given the input cost and currency “headwinds”, “we will continue to aggressively manage costs and evaluate further opportunities to increase net selling prices.”For the second quarter, Kimberly-Clark said its sales were up 1 per cent to $4.6bn. Net income was $465m, down from $540m in the same period last year.
9;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
10;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2018-04-23T13:03:31Z;Kimberly-Clark lifts full-year sales forecast;;"Kimberly-Clark shares rose in pre-market trade after the company boosted its sales forecasts for 2018 following encouraging growth in its personal care and tissue products during the first quarter.

However, the company’s first-quarter earnings were weighed down by charges related to a previously-announced restructuring programme as well as the rising cost of inputs.Kimberly-Clark said it expected net sales to rise by between 2 and 3 per cent in the 2018 financial year, up from a previous 1 to 2 per cent range, with an expected lift from favourable currency movements.However, the company, which makes Kleenex tissues, Depend adult incontinence products and Kotex feminine care products, said inflation in some of its key inputs would be higher than previously thought. Input costs would rise by $400m-$550m this year, it said — between $100m and $150m higher than earlier estimates.In January, Kimberly-Clark initiated a global restructuring programme it hopes will reduce its cost base and boost future growth. The plan is forecast to deliver annual pre-tax cost savings of $500m-$550m by the end of 2021, but is expected to incur restructuring charges of $1.7bn-$1.9bn before tax by the end of 2020.In the first three months of this year, Kimberly-Clark booked a restructuring charge of $577m before tax that dragged first quarter operating profit down to $247m from $848m a year earlier. Stripping out the charge, adjusted operating profit was marginally higher than analysts’ estimates in a Reuters survey.Total sales were up 5 per cent year-on-year to $4.7bn, around $100m higher than forecast. Net income fell to $93m from $563m a year earlier.Thomas Falk, chief executive, said the company was “broadly on track” with its plan for the year:I’m encouraged by the 2 per cent organic sales growth we delivered in the first quarter, led by improved performance in North America.

12;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2018-02-02T12:41:54Z;Big brands lose pricing power in battle for consumers;Names from P&G to Nestlé feel the pinch as shoppers show less loyalty and trade down;A week after Nelson Peltz bought a $3.5bn stake in Procter & Gamble, the first salvo in months of jockeying between the activist billionaire investor and the consumer goods giant, P&G made a calculation. After years of losing market share to challengers like Dollar Shave Club, P&G announced it would cut the price of its trademark Gillette razors by up to 20 per cent — Barclays analysts called it “an act of desperation”. The move came as P&G responded to Mr Peltz’s arguments that the company needed to win back customers, even if it meant discounts on what had long advertised as “premium” products. “You told us our blades can be too expensive and we listened,” the Gillette website explains.P&G is not alone. The super-brands that dominate the grocery aisles in stores and online have a price problem, which has echoed through income statements of the largest consumer goods companies in recent weeks. The last three months of 2017 marked the first time since 2011 that the average prices for products sold by P&G and Colgate-Palmolive fell, with particularly severe declines in categories such as razor blades and nappies where online competition is strongest. Rival Kimberly-Clark announced it was laying off 5,000 employees as it revealed declining prices for products such as nappies. Mondelez International, which makes Oreo biscuits and Ritz crackers, reported that prices for the year rose 1.5 per cent on average, but slipped in its two biggest markets — North America and Europe. This is good news for shoppers, but it has pressured profits at the world’s biggest consumer-facing companies. “Pricing is looking tougher than we have ever seen in [consumer] staples,” say analysts at Société Générale.The product manufacturers are being squeezed by the big retailers — notably, Amazon and Walmart, which together sell $600bn worth of goods a year. Walmart has long put pressure on suppliers to cut prices. Amazon’s rise has exacerbated the “deflationary impact”, Société Générale says, creating a “much tougher environment in the US”. After Amazon bought Whole Foods in June, the price war grew more intense in groceries, pushing prices to historic lows that punished producers. Brand loyalty has suffered in the process. Equipped with the tools to compare prices online instantly, and bombarded with more choices, shoppers are growing more likely to opt for cheaper and discounted products — particularly in categories such laundry detergent and shampoo. To keep their spots on store shelves, brands are having to accept lower prices.“There’s more info online for people to be able to judge: is this just marketing? Should I pay more for it?” says Kathy Gersch, vice-president at Kotter, a consultancy. “The heyday of the brand itself being enough of a differentiator to demand a higher price point . . . is diminishing.”Brian Gladden, chief financial officer at Mondelez, says his company faces “a competitive retailer environment”. He expects Mondelez’s pricing in North America and Europe, which fell 0.6 per cent and 0.1 per cent, respectively, last year, to be “about the same” in 2018. Former Amazon employees say the company’s algorithms scan prices across competitors in real time, automatically adjusting its own so it can offer the lowest price. While most big brands have wholesale agreements with Amazon, third-party sellers are prolific on the site, complicating price control further. A 34oz bottle of P&G’s Pantene Pro-V Shampoo & Conditioner was listed by 10 different sellers — nine of them third parties — on the shopping site.Amazon’s dominance makes it difficult for brands to abandon the platform, or try to sell directly on their own websites. “You have 200m customers on Amazon. If you walk away, there’s 200m people who are going to just buy from your competitors,” says James Thomson, a former Amazon manager who consults brands. “You’re probably not going to win.”“This is a pretty dire situation,” he adds. “If brands are worried about meeting quarterly targets, they can’t afford to lose Amazon sales.”Still, “the retailers have nothing to gain by pushing [consumer products makers] into bankruptcy”, says Bryan Roberts, director of TCC Global Retailers, a consultancy, noting in some categories, iconic brands still have clout. Even disrupters like Aldi, the discount German grocer, have been forced to sell brands such as Coca-Cola, he points out. The pricing issue was raised repeatedly throughout earnings calls in the past few weeks, as executives tried to reassure investors. Jon Moeller, chief financial officer at P&G, admitted that “significant retail competition” coupled with slow market growth is “forcing prices down”.“We’ve made some changes in our Luvs [nappies] pricing . . . to respond to those realities,” he said. But he added that while it is an immediate “pain point” he does not think pricing has “gone through the sea shift that should reflect your view on the industry long-term”. Unilever, which reported its full-year results on Thursday, revealed that underlying prices in North America fell 1 per cent in the last quarter of the 2017, compared with the same quarter a year earlier. This was steeper than the 0.1 per cent decline for the full year but volumes increased 3.2 per cent in the quarter. Graeme Pitkethly, finance director of the Anglo-Dutch company that makes Dove soap, Axe deodorant and Hellmann's mayonnaise, said: “Over the last few years US prices have been relatively strong compared to Europe, so it’s not really a surprise that, as you see Amazon and e-commerce growing, you start to see a softening happening in pricing.” However, the US accounts for only 13 per cent of sales at Unilever, which is instead far more reliant on emerging markets. These, led by India and Indonesia account for almost 60 per cent of its revenues, which totalled €53.7bn last year.Investors are still waiting for last quarter’s results from the three European companies with the biggest US exposure — Nestlé, L’Oréal, and Reckitt Benckiser. However, Nestlé, the Swiss food group behind Kit Kat chocolate and Nescafé coffee, has said Amazon and discounters were having a deflationary impact on US prices, according to SocGen.Consumer goods companies have responded to the pricing pressures by aggressively cutting costs, led by the “zero-based budgeting” model of 3G Capital, the New York-based private equity group that has transformed the consumer industry with bold acquisitions. Adjusted operating income margin at Mondelez climbed 1.3 percentage points to 16.3 per cent last year, as the company embarked on a $3bn cost-savings programme running through this year. P&G has pledged to cut $10bn in annual costs by 2021, while Unilever expects to save €2bn through a three-year cost-cutting drive.The strategy may be an enduring one for these groups as they reckon with their declining pricing power, analysts say.“It takes a long time to admit you’re not a growth company any more,” says Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. “It’s getting to that point.”Fast food is staging its own race to the bottom. The price of groceries in the US fell to a 40-year low last year, forcing restaurants into efforts to win back customers with more incentive to cook for themselves at home.There has been “little to no” growth in visits to restaurants in the past two years, according to market researchers NPD Group, while trade publication QSR defined 2017 as the worst for restaurants since the financial crisis, after sales dropped sharply in the second half of the year. McDonald’s, the largest burger chain, has looked to attract customers by going back to its roots as a vendor of cheap food. It unveiled a number of promotions last year, such as dollar drinks and $2 coffees. In January, it overhauled its Dollar Menu in the US with a new “Value Menu”, offering cheeseburgers for $1 and other items priced at $2 and $3. “We don’t see any significant broader market growth this year, so we know we’re in a market share fight — and value is where the street fighting really hits,” Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s chief executive, told investors this week.Analysts warn this could have a snowball effect as rivals look to keep up. “Fast food competitors are gearing up to combat this new value effort from McDonald’s, setting up 2018 as a potential year for intensive discounting in the fast food space, particularly in the first part of the year,” analysts at Credit Suisse said. 
13;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Kimberly Clark squeezed by weak nappy sales and higher pulp prices;;From diapers to toothpaste, Americans’ love affair with big brands is fading fast.Kimberly Clark, the $44bn company behind Huggies nappies and Kleenex, has become the latest consumer goods powerhouse to disappoint amid continued sluggishness in its North American business.The company lowered the bottom end of its full-year sales expectations for a second time this year. It now expects net and organic sales to be flat or “up slightly” in 2017, compared to the 1-2 per cent growth it was forecasting just three months ago and the 2 per cent increase it predicted at the start of the year.Earnings per share meanwhile will be at the low end of its target range of $6.20-$6.35 this year as the pain from weakening demand for its key products is further compounded by sharply higher raw material prices – namely for pulp, which is used to make everything from wipes and Kleenexes to nappies.Input cost inflation will total between $200m-$300m this year compared to the $150m-$250m estimate it gave in April and the $50m to $200m it had predicted six months ago.“Our second quarter results reflect a challenging environment,” said chief executive Thomas Falk.For the three months to end of June, like-for-like sales – a key industry metric – fell 1 per cent while net sales dropped by a similar margin to $4.55bn, missing estimates for a slimmer drop to $4.56bn.The decline was particularly pronounced in North America, where weaker Huggies sales dragged sales in the personal care business 1 per cent lower, and the consumer tissue business suffered a 4 per cent drop. The ongoing price war with rival diaper makers has heaped further pressure on the top line.Net income for the quarter came in at $531m, a 6 per cent drop from the prior year period and below the $533.2m analysts were expecting.“The competitive environment has intensified, category growth feels sluggish, reinvestment needs are likely going up, commodity pressures will likely increase over the next 12 months, and we expect the company to go through a CEO transition in the not-too-distant future,” said analysts at Citi in a note earlier this month. The bank kept is neutral rating on the company however, saying takeover speculation will continue to give support to the stock “for some time to come”.Indeed, shares in Kimberly Clark have risen 8.5 per cent so far this year despite the guidance cuts.Its results come after Colgate-Palmolive disappointed with its second quarter results last week. Having consistently delivered organic sales, the company behind Colgate toothpaste and Palmolive dishwashing soap surprised by failing to deliver any like-for-like growth during the period – the first that has happened in years. Colgate, citing “challenging” conditions, also lowered its full year outlook for the metric to low-single-digit growth, compared to the 4-7 per cent increase it had previously forecast.
14;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2017-04-24T13:05:28Z;Kimberly-Clark cuts lower end of sales guidance on stiff competition;;The battle for the bottoms of North American babies continued to take its toll on US consumer goods maker Kimberly-Clark during the first quarter.Shares in the company behind Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissue fell 1.8 per cent in pre-market trading on Monday after it lowered the bottom end of its full year organic and net sales forecasts.With the headwinds caused by rising input costs and falling demand for its core products in North America showing little sign of abating, the company said it now expects organic and net sales to grow between 1 to 2 per cent this year, compared to its previous assumption of about 2 per cent growth.“The update reflects modestly higher assumptions on average for several raw materials, including pulp, recycled fibre and polypropylene resin,” it said in a statement.The revision comes as Kimberly-Clark reported first quarter net sales that were little changed from the prior year period at $4.48bn. Within this, organic sales fell 1 per cent during the period.Huggies – which widely positions itself as a mid-tier brand – has seen its sales in North America squeezed as parents choose to either spend more on more upmarket brand Pampers or go downmarket with Luvs, both of which are owned by rival Procter & Gamble.Kimberly-Clark said Huggies nappies volumes in North America fell by mid-single digits during the first quarter quarter, “reflecting category softness, competitive activity and less promotion shipments.”Fierce price wars also weighed on sales of its other core business – consumer tissue products. Sales at the unit – whose brands include Kleenex and Cottonelle and Scott toilet paper – fell 3 per cent to $1.5bn during the quarter amid a 7 per cent slump in North American sales volume.“The decline was mostly in bathroom tissue, including impacts from competitive activity and lower promotion shipments,” the company said.Net income came in ahead of expectations however, rising 3 per cent to $563m, or $1.57 per share during the quarter, thanks to better cost control.
15;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2017-01-24T13:02:47Z;Diaper wars, strong dollar continue to weigh on Kimberly-Clark;;The battle for bottoms — young and old — continued to weigh on US consumer goods maker Kimberly Clark during the fourth quarter.The company reported sales and profits that came in a touch below market expectations as it was held back by weak demand for its core products — Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues — and the strong dollar, which eroded its overseas earnings.Kimberly-Clark said Huggies nappies volumes in North America fell by high-single digits during the December quarter, compared to mid-single digit growth it recorded in the year-ago period, as a result of “promotion shipments and lower category demand.”Like-for-like sales rose just 1 per cent during the period while net sales was flat at $4.54bn. Net income for the quarter came in at $505m, or $1.40 per diluted share.The market had forecast revenues of $4.54bn and earnings of $1.42 per share.“While we experienced a challenging economic and competitive environment in 2016, our market share positions remained broadly healthy,” said chief executive Thomas J. Falk.The company said net sales in 2017 are expected to be similar to 2016, including organic sales growth of approximately 2 per cent. Diluted net income per share for 2017 is anticipated to be $6.20 to $6.35.Despite the challenging outlook, the company’s board of directors approved a 5.4 per cent increase in the quarterly dividend, taking the dividend to 97 cents per share, up from 92 cents per share in 2016.
16;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Kimberly-Clark cuts guidance as diaper wars heat up;;The aggressive price war that has broken out in the adult diapers market is taking its toll on Kimberley-Clark’s top and bottom lines.The maker of Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues was forced to lower its guidance on a number of key metrics after it reported an unexpected drop in third quarter sales as the strong dollar exacerbated the weaker demand trend for its core diaper products.The company said it now expected like-for-like sales – a closely watched industry gauge – to grow just 2 per cent this year, compared to its prior expectations of 3-5 per cent. Full year diluted earnings per share will now come in at $5.92 to $6.05, down from the $5.92 to $6.15 it had previously forecast.Shares in the company fell 3.8 per cent in pre-market trading.Kimberly-Clark is facing stiff competition from P&G, which moved back into the adult incontinence products business two years ago, and Japan’s Unicharm, whose premium nappies offerings have won it market shares in China and Latin America.The competition and heavy discounting is reflected in Kimberly-Clark’s disappointing third quarter earnings.For the three months to September 30, net sales fell 2.6 per cent to $4.59bn, against market expectations for a slight increase to $4.72bn. Of this, the company said dollar strength reduced sales by more than 2 per cent. Like-for-like sales was flat.Net income rose thanks to cost cutting. But at $550m for the quarter, they were still short of the $556m the market was expecting.Kimberly Clark said:Huggies diaper and adult care volumes were down low single-digits and mid-single digits, respectively, compared to double-digit growth in the year-ago period that included benefits from innovation launches and increased promotion shipments.Adult care volumes in 2016 were also impacted by competitive promotion activity.
17;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2016-08-26T05:00:20Z;Kimberly-Clark tackles incontinence taboo;Eradicating the stigma associated with the condition is key to accelerating growth;For Gustavo Calvo Paz, Kimberly-Clark’s head of Europe, Middle East and Africa, the stigma associated with incontinence was laid bare on a research trip to Saudi Arabia.He listened to a story about a husband in his 50s who had become emotionally withdrawn. The family wondered if this was due to incontinence and did some research, leading them to purchase a pack of the company’s Depend brand which they left in his car. Mr Calvo Paz says the family laugh about their strategy now, but underlying the silence was fear of embarrassing the husband, who began using the product.This may be seen as an extreme example, but Mr Calvo Paz points out that even in developed markets, stigma around the widespread condition exists and eradicating it is key for accelerating growth.“The scale of incontinence and range [of types of it] are poorly understood, and it is an issue that will grow,” Mr Calvo Paz says. “Incontinence is a physical and emotional condition, and it impacts people in both ways.”Incontinence is big business due to ageing populations and rising obesity — which has been linked to the condition. There is also a growing recognition that it affects a wide range of people and ages for various reasons and levels of intensity. Global retail sales, which exclude supply to healthcare institutions, rose 8.1 per cent to $7.2bn last year, while retail sales in western Europe rose 8.2 per cent to $1.6bn. In the Middle East and Africa, sales increased 8.7 per cent to $92.2m.While Mr Calvo Paz declined to give growth targets for the region, he says revenues at its incontinence business are rising at double the pace of its other products. The company faces stiff competition in western Europe, where Sweden’s SCA Group leads the pack with its Tena brand, with Procter & Gamble’s Always and Linidor also ahead, leaving the Depend brand ranked sixth, according to Euromonitor. It ranks number one in the US.In developed markets public dialogue has helped reduce stigma and spawned a wide range of products from pads to cotton briefs to tampon-like devices.Kimberly-Clark estimates that one in three women and 10 per cent of men suffer from some form of incontinence, and contrary to assumptions that it is a condition that afflicts mainly the elderly, about half of sufferers are aged between 22 and 54.Svetlana Uduslivaia, head of tissue and hygiene at Euromonitor, says that for men in particular, incontinence is of higher concern than impotence. “It has a serious effect on the mind and masculinity,” she says.Kimberly-Clark estimates that in the UK about 70 per cent of women are using mainly feminine hygiene products to deal with involuntary bladder leakage. These are made to absorb a different speed of flow and do not contain the chemicals needed to neutralise acidic urine, which can cause skin rashes, leaving users vulnerable when out and about.Mr Calvo Paz says the company is developing new products, using advertising, social media and relationships with pharmacies and other medical organisations as part of its strategy to educate people around the subject — and boost sales.Incontinence is a physical and emotional condition, and it impacts people in both waysBut, he says, the shift from the so-called institutional market to retail sales in Europe will be key to driving growth in Europe. This market, which involves the supply of products to healthcare institutions such as hospitals and nursing homes, is much larger than the retail market — in contrast to the US where the reverse is true. Mr Calvo Paz cites countries such as the Netherlands as having reduced subsidies available for incontinence products, while Ms Uduslivaia says this was also happening in the UK amid the austerity drive.Given the stigma, online sales are seen as a pivotal platform to generate growth. Online-only specialist companies are emerging, and while they have yet to upend larger companies, they are taking note. Domtar, whose Indasec brand ranks fourth in Europe, recently acquired a tiny US direct-to-consumer producer called Home Delivery Incontinent Supplies. It also bought Butterfly Health, which provides products for accidental bowel leakage.And product quality is important, with consumers wanting to feel safe, comfortable and discreet. The industry is no longer about the “adult diaper”. New Zealand’s Confitex has been pushing the boundaries, becoming the first company to show its incontinence lingerie collection at a fashion show.“It has to work, and it has to hold, but there is an aesthetic aspect that is definitely becoming important,” Ms Uduslivaia says.
18;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2016-08-24T17:41:55Z;SCA group: not a page turner;How separated divisions works out is an open question;"Swedes specialise in noirish thrillers. On Wednesday the paper maker Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget delivered a shock of a happier sort: it intends to hack off its hygiene businesses from its forest product unit. The proposal is welcome; how the plot unfolds is another matter.Through its pulp and paper arm SCA is the largest private owner of forest in Europe. The unit produces material for packaging as well as print, and solid wood products for construction. SCA’s tissue business manufactures toilet paper and sanitary products; the personal care unit produces nappies.The forest product unit is one of several suppliers to other parts of the business. Last year, SCA derived 15 per cent of revenues and 18 per cent of its operating cash flow from the forest unit. “Biological assets” (mostly trees) accounted for 27 per cent of the group’s non-current assets. As a result of this large asset base, the forest unit returns a lowly 7 per cent on its capital employed. This is in line with competitor Holmen, but much lower than the 30 per cent return for personal care and 15 per cent for the tissue businesses.SCA’s shares jumped 7 per cent on the separation announcement. Using Kimberly-Clark and Holmen as proxies for the two future hygiene and forest companies, shares could still have some room to appreciate. SCA group trades at 19 times this year’s price to forward earnings. Assuming each new division trades at an average multiple of earnings for each sector, then — adjusted for their contribution to the group — SCA should trade maybe a few per cent higher.In other words, unlocking the conglomerate discount won’t be enough to justify a much bigger increase. Moreoever, a tenth of sales derive from the UK with its uncertain growth prospects. And the print industry offers little expansion for SCA’s pulp and paper unit. Shares have priced a lot in. Don’t expect many more happy surprises from here.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
19;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2016-07-25T12:19:46Z;Kimberly Clarke sales fall, nappies rise;;A soggy bottom.US consumer goods Kimberly Clark reported a 1.2 per cent decrease in sales in the second quarter despite a healthy boost to sales in its nappy range.The maker of Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues said sales fell to $4.6bn over the same quarter last year, but still exceeded the lower end of analyst estimates of $4.45bn. Net income rose to $566m from a $305m loss in the same period in 2015.Kimberly Clarke said it remained on track to hit its fully year earnings guidance as sales of its adult, child and feminine care range rose 10 per cent, with nappies growing in “mid-single digits”.Adverse foreign exchange movements reduced overall sales by 4 per cent, but organic sales rose 3 per cent as volumes increased 4 per cent in the three months ending June 30.Adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter were $1.53 against a forecast range of $1.44-$1.51, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Thomas Falk, chairman and chief executive, said: “We delivered a good quarter of results in a challenging environment while we continue to execute our long-term Global Business Plan strategies.”“Half way through the year, we are broadly on track with our plans and are confirming our bottom-line earnings guidance for 2016.”
20;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2016-07-12T02:40:27Z;Maduro says Citibank to close Venzuela’s currency accounts;;Embattled Venezuela seems to be too much to take for Citibank, as Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolás Maduro said on Monday that the US-based bank will shut down his government’s foreign currency accounts within a month.Mr Maduro asserted the move was part of a “financial blockade”, writes the FT’s Andres Schipani.“Without warning Citibank says that in 30 days it will close the Central Bank and the Bank of Venezuela’s accounts. That is called financial blockade,” he said in a speech, adding his government uses Citibank for transactions in the United States and elsewhere.“Do you think they’re going to stop us with a financial blockade? No, gentlemen, this is a different world. Nobody stops Venezuela. With Citibank or without Citibank, we march on,” he said, adding, “with Kimberly or without Kimberly, we march on”, referring to Kimberly-Clark, the international maker of personal care products which has halted operations there.In a statement responding to Mr Maduro’s speech, Citi told the Financial Times:Following a periodic risk management review in Venezuela, Citi has decided to discontinue correspondent banking and the servicing of certain accounts in the country. This decision is not a reflection of our commitment to a country we have served for almost 100 years. We value our dialogue with the President’s administration and hope to address its concerns in the interest of continuing to serve our clients.On Saturday, Kimberly-Clark said it was “indefinitely suspending all business operations in Venezuela, effective immediately, due to the continued deterioration of economic and business conditions” as the protracted slump in crude prices continue to weigh heavily on the oil-dependent economy.On Monday, the socialist government said it took over the company’s local plant. “Kimberly-Clark will continue producing for all Venezuelans and is now in the hands of the workers,” Labor Minister Oswaldo Vera said.Ravaged by a recession, galloping inflation and food shortages, critics would argue Venezuela is now being “stopped” first and foremost by the mismanagement of Mr Maduro’s government. But in a time-honoured tradition officials have pointed fingers at political foes and local businessmen, accusing them of waging an “economic war” against the country.
21;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2016-07-11T13:49:21Z;Venezuelans cross border in hunt for food;Mass shortages prompt thousands to enter Colombia to shop ;Omar Torres felt a rush of emotion as he crossed the Simón Bolívar bridge between Colombia and Venezuela with his wife and daughters. “We almost cried when we entered Colombia, and we realised we were going to be able to, at last, buy the food we lack in Venezuela,” he said.The Torres family were among an estimated 35,000 Venezuelans who poured into Colombia on Sunday after the embattled socialist government of Nicolás Maduro allowed crossings for 14 hours to let people buy basic goods amid chronic shortages in Venezuela. Mr Maduro closed the border last August, allegedly to crack down on crime and contraband.Observers see this as a foretaste of what a humanitarian crisis would look like if nothing is done to end Venezuela’s downward spiral. Senior Colombian officials say “there is already a plan” to welcome refugees if there is a social implosion next door, where an estimated 3m Colombians live.Sunday’s exodus followed an incident last week in which at least 500 Venezuelan women — dressed in white as a “symbol of peace” in homage to the Cuban dissident movement — defied the border closure and pushed past Venezuelan guards to find basic goods for their families.José Vielma Mora, the socialist governor of the Venezuelan frontier state of Táchira, said that action was orchestrated by the opposition to generate “chaos”. But in the Colombian city of Cúcuta on Sunday, Venezuelans from all over the country crowded supermarkets and calmly gathered as much rice, cooking oil and maize flour as they could carry. These items are either in short supply at home or sold at exorbitant prices by buy-and-flip hustlers who resell subsidised products.“There are a number of indications that the food supply situation is becoming critical and that a large part of the population is simply not finding enough to eat,” said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based senior analyst with the International Crisis Group. “It is also apparent that the security forces are finding it increasingly difficult to deal with unrest arising from the lack of food and other basic goods. Although Venezuela is not yet facing famine, there are some indicators that are typical of countries entering a period of food crisis.” There are a number of indications that the food supply situation is becoming critical and that a large part of the population is simply not finding enough to eatThese include increasing incidence of malnutrition. Looting and food riots are also becoming commonplace. Socialist officials usually blame the problems on an “economic war” launched by rightwing foes and business leaders with the backing of Washington. Venezuela’s foreign minister denied before the Organization of American States last month that her country was suffering from a humanitarian crisis. “I saw people dying cause of lack of medicines, children with malnutrition, and this beast of a woman dared saying there is no humanitarian crisis there,” said Isley Márquez, a nurse from the nearby Venezuelan city of San Cristóbal, as she clutched plastic bags of goods outside a supermarket in central Cúcuta. More than 80 per cent of staple goods are missing from supermarket shelves in Caracas, according to Datanálisis, a pollster. Food production has plummeted, say industry insiders, because of price and currency controls and the impact of nationalisations in the food industry. The government owes $30bn to private suppliers and importers, according to Ecoanalítica, a Caracas-based consultancy. Scarcities are set to worsen as consumer goods producers struggle to keep operations afloat in the import-dependent country. Companies operating in Venezuela have been unable to purchase raw materials or obtain hard currency, while producers, as well as impoverished consumers, have been hit by high inflation projected by the IMF to top 481 per cent this year and a jaw-dropping 1,643 per cent in 2017.On Saturday, Kimberly-Clark became the latest company to close its operations in the country. The US-based producer of toilet paper, nappies and tissues said it was “indefinitely suspending all business operations in Venezuela, effective immediately, due to the continued deterioration of economic and business conditions”. Empresas Polar, the country’s top food producer, has stopped producing beer until it can get access to foreign currency to procure necessary materials. Sources say the company is running dangerously short on rice and maize flour, the base ingredient for Venezuela’s staple, the arepa.As Venezuelans crossed the Simón Bolívar international bridge back to their homes on Sunday, a green and white sign bade them farewell: “Goodbye, friend. Come back soon.” For the time being, Venezuelans like Mr Torres have little choice.

Both Electronic Arts and Ryder are rated among the lowest levels of investment grade, which contrasts with the A minus or higher rating that the sales earned on Monday.“We have seen over and over again the fact that we have had these windows of opportunity in between bouts of volatility,” said Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott. Tuesday was a “test of the waters. Prior issues by these companies were oversubscribed. If they come with new issues and they are oversubscribed, lower-rated companies should have success.”Hans Mikkelsen, a credit strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, noted that the offerings on Tuesday came at a price: companies had to pay up.The yield on bonds issued by the group were on average 19 basis points more than on similar dated paper issued by the five companies in years past.While spreads have widened significantly in the investment grade market — the difference between the average issue in the BofA Merrill Lynch US corporate bond index and its respective benchmark Treasury has widened to 219bp from 129bp last March — Mr Mikkelsen put most of the move down to the rally in Treasury prices.“High-grade investors tend to be yield sensitive, and hence when interest rates decline rapidly they tend to sit on the sidelines,” he said. “That ‘buyer strike’ type behaviour leads to ‘sticky’ corporate yields, and thus the big decline in risk-free interest rates gets reflected in significant spread widening almost in the relation one-to-one.”Portfolio managers say they are closely watching the performance of new issues after bond sales in January sold off alongside the market’s move lower. If prices rise or are stable, investors say they could expect a wave of offerings from companies that have waited for volatility to subside.The new paper from Apple and Comcast advanced following the Tuesday sale. The iPhone maker’s new 30-year bonds, which sold with a yield of 4.69 per cent, tightened to trade with a yield of 4.65 per cent, data from bond trading platform MarketAxess showed.Earlier in the day, the yield hit a low of 4.53 per cent as the bond price rallied to 101.96 cents on the dollar. Yields move inversely to prices.The offerings have lifted US marketed high-grade bond deals to $156bn, 3.3 per cent below the year-ago amount of $161bn, Dealogic figures show. However, the issuance has been concentrated among fewer issuers. The average deal this year has eclipsed $1.8bn, more than double the average through the same point in 2015.Fewer than 90 investment grade companies have sold debt to US investors this year, the lowest number since at least 1995.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt"

In the junk market, Prestige Brands raised $350m, US capital markets correspondent Eric Platt reports.It had been 12 days since an A minus or higher rated company had completed a bond deal — a drought that had somewhat concerned investors —, according to Dealogic.On Wednesday, US gaming group Electronic Arts, trucking company Ryder Systems and Kimberly-Clark, the maker of personal and healthcare goods, added their names to the list.Hans Mikkelsen, a credit strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, noted that the offerings on Tuesday came at a price: companies had to pay up.

The S&P 500 is down almost 10 per cent this year; US bank shares are down 20 per cent; it is best to look away from European bank shares; junk bond yields are bubbling up. This is what fear looks like.If you are the more common type, who is fearful when others are fearful, you are either selling or rotating into defensive shares. This means things such as consumer staples. In the last big bear market, from late 2007 to early 2009, the S&P 500 lost half its value. Its staples components only lost a quarter.Walmart stood out: it rose during the crash. And its shares have risen in 2016. Alas, Amazonand discount stores have changed retail. Walmart 2016 is anticipating lower profits. In 2007, it was growing.Better, surely, to own the companies that make what consumers buy no matter what. Hormel — which makes spam and other long-lasting foods you will eat while in your basement hiding from zombies — fell only 15 per cent in 2007-09. Kimberly-Clark, which is a bet that people will keep wiping their noses and going to the bathroom, outperformed too. Or maybe, like a lot of people, you’ve resumed smoking in the new year. Altria had an even better crisis than Kimberly-Clark.There is a little problem, though. All those stocks are much more expensive, relative to profits, than they were when the market turned in 2007. Back then you could have Hormel for 16 times earnings. Now you pay 30. Kimberly-Clark and Altria have gone from 16 times to more than 20. Price/earnings ratios are 15 per cent higher since 2007 for the staples group generally. Revenue growth is much lower, too.The safety trade that worked so well in 2007 was never fully unwound. And stocks, in general, are more expensive than they were at the last peak. Quantitative easing, designed to push everyone towards risk, worked.

25;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2016-01-26T18:26:45Z;Strong US dollar weighs on consumer goods groups;P&G, J&J and K-C all suffer currency hit as slowing emerging market growth helps propel greenback;The strong dollar is taking its toll on the world’s largest consumer goods companies, forcing many to raise prices and cut costs amid an increasingly unsettled global economic environment that is prompting warnings about volatile trading ahead.Procter & Gamble kept its pledge for the second quarter with a return to growth, of 2 per cent, in organic sales. But the negative impact of the strong dollar meant that net sales sank 9 per cent to $16.9bn in the three months to December 31, it said on Tuesday.Smaller rival Kimberly-Clark, which announced fourth-quarter earnings on Monday, reported that sales had dropped 6 per cent to $4.5bn, which it said was wholly because of the strong dollar.Revenue at Johnson & Johnson, predominantly a pharmaceuticals company with a consumer goods division, was dragged down 2.4 per cent to $17.8bn by currency swings.Executives have reeled off a litany of economic and geopolitical minefields that they are having to navigate. The slump in commodity prices, including oil, is eating into consumer confidence, while the volatile Chinese stock market and slowing emerging market growth is causing reverberations across the globe and helping propel the dollar higher.Jon Moeller, chief financial officer at P&G, said that the world’s largest consumer products company was operating in a “very challenging and volatile macroeconomic environment”. He cut his growth forecast for the consumer goods markets in which P&G operates to 2-3 per cent from 3-4 per cent.Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, warned earlier this month that “this volatility is here to stay”.P&G’s sales and profits have been affected more dramatically by currency swings than its European rivals, Mr Moeller pointed out, citing the example of the rouble. The dollar has doubled in value against the Russian currency, while the euro has gained between 40 and 60 per cent, he said.PZ Cussons, the British consumer company that has substantial operations in Nigeria, said that a “key risk” for its second half was a further devaluation of the naira.P&G said that it expected currency swings to reduce sales in its financial year to June by 7 percentage points instead of the 5-6 points it had forecast, while Kimberly-Clark expected 2016 revenue to be dented by 5-6 percentage points.“Fast-moving consumer goods companies have undoubtedly been hit hard by currency fluctuations and a slowdown in key emerging markets,” Will Hayllar, partner at OC & C Strategy Consultants said. “Currency volatility is a particular challenge for consumer goods companies because these businesses are producing for consumers who don’t want to deal with rapidly changing prices.”P&G has been increasing prices in many markets to counter the impact of currency swings, sacrificing volume and some market share in the short term to restore profit margins. Mr Moeller said that the aim was to grow at market rates or above and was not prepared to “lose share indefinitely”.While sales in China dropped by “high-single digits” in the quarter, P&G said that it expected a better second half thanks to premium products and higher pricing. P&G said it was optimistic about sales growth in China as the country shifts to a consumer-based economy and the end of the one-child policy helps boost the population.P&G fared much better in Brazil where Mr Moeller said that it had adopted the “right pricing” policy, with organic sales rising 11 per cent compared with a 12 per cent decline in the first quarter.“Speed of movement is critical for producers to win in these volatile environments,” Mr Hayllar said. “The biggest consumer goods giants have been losing share to smaller local producers, largely because the smaller players have been more agile in responding to changing conditions and fragmenting consumer needs.”The fall in commodity prices is a double-edged sword for companies like P&G. While on the one hand it reduces input costs of the materials used to make their products, the bigger impact is on consumer spending in markets such as Russia, Venezuela and certain Middle Eastern countries, where the currencies slump has damaged local economies and consumer spending with it.Mr Moeller added that prices of resin and other petroleum-based products had not come down to the same extent as crude oil.
26;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2016-01-25T13:06:32Z;Kimberly-Clark sees another tough year ahead;;The strong dollar and plunging emerging market currencies have made 2015 a painful year for Kimberly-Clark, and the consumer goods company is not expecting the headwinds to ease in 2016.The maker of Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues said on Monday that it expects net sales to fall by as much as another 3 per cent this year following a 6 per cent drop in 2015.While sales volumes were up across its key emerging markets, currencies turmoil – including the 27 per cent devaluation of the Argentine peso, a 29 per cent plunge in the Brazilian real and a near 10 per cent drop in the Mexican peso – has sharply reduced the value of those sales for the Dallas-based company.For the year to end of December, net sales at the company fell 6 per cent to $18.6bn. Net income was down by a third to $1.1bn, or $2.77 per diluted share after the company took a $102m charge on its operations in Venezuela because of difficulties in repatriating its funds out of the country.Kimberly-Clark said in light of another year of “significantly unfavorable currencies”, net sales are expected to be somewhere in a range between flat and down 3 per cent compared to the prior year. A negative foreign currency exchange rate impact of between 5-6 per cent is expected to negate organic sales growth of 3-5 per cent.Shares in Kimberly-Clark, up 13.5 per cent over the past year, are down 2.5 per cent in pre-market trading.
27;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Chipotle shares slide on growth concerns;Kimberly-Clark is latest US company walloped by the strong dollar;Chipotle shares dropped 5.8 per cent on Wednesday after the chain reported leaner profits than had been expected, fuelling worries about a slowdown in the burrito restaurant’s rapid growth.Late on Tuesday Chipotle said its net profits climbed to $144.9m, from $130.8m in the same period in 2014. On a per-share basis, the fast-food chain earned $4.59, missing Wall Street estimates of $4.62.Sales rose by 12 per cent to $1.22bn, meeting estimates. Same-store sales, a key metric for retailers, climbed 2.6 per cent. Chipotle said it expected same-store sales to rise in the “low to mid single-digits” this year.The chain known for its guacamole and tacos has experienced rapid growth in recent years. Revenues, for example, climbed 27.8 per cent last year.However, the company this year experienced issues sourcing pork that was raised to its standards for its carnitas product, weighing on sales in certain markets.In many ways, Chipotle is representative of a shift in consumer taste that has troubled other performers in the fast-food realm.For example McDonald’s, the world’s biggest burger chain, has seen its sales stall as it has struggled to drum up demand.Chipotle’s third-quarter results “demonstrate the continued success of our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food,” said Steve Ells, founder and co-chief.Shares in Chipotle have fallen 3 per cent this year, while shares of competitor Shake Shack has shrunk 8 per cent and McDonald’s shares are up 9 per cent.Kimberly-Clark, the consumer goods company best known for its Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues, was the latest US company to be walloped by the strong dollar.It warned on Tuesday that is now expected full year sales to fall between 10 and 11 per cent, a touch beyond the previous guidance for a 10 per cent drop, due to currency headwinds.Sales in developing and emerging markets decreased 11 per cent, including a 25 per cent negative impact from changes in currency rates.Stripping out foreign currency impact, Kimberly-Clark said organic sales would grow 4-5 per cent and adjusted earnings per share would be $5.70-$5.80.The company had previously predicted organic growth of 3 to 5 per cent and adjusted EPS of $5.65 to $5.80.The forecast revisions came as Kimberly-Clark reported a drop in sales and earnings for the third quarter, although it still beat analyst estimates, leading the shares 0.7 per cent higher on Wednesday.Shares in Yahoo were down 5.2 per cent, building upon Tuesday’s 2 per cent loss, after the struggling internet company missed expectations on both earnings and revenues in the third quarter. Yahoo’s stock has dropped 38 per cent so far this year.GM shares rose 5.9 per cent after the company said strong US car sales boosted its earnings to record levels for the three months to the end of September.The Michigan-based company saw net profits up more than a third to 3.1bn, powered by cheap gasoline prices in the US that have fuelled sales for larger vehicles.Stocks on Wall Street were weaker on Wednesday after mixed corporate earnings. The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent at 2,018.94, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent at 17,168.61. The Nasdaq Composite shed 0.8 per cent at 4,840.12.
28;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2015-04-28T12:01:52Z;Kimberly-Clark competition helps to boost online engagement;US company backs innovative ideas to find what inspires customers;US-based consumer goods company Kimberly-Clark has invested in a number of start-ups in an effort to discover technology that would inspire customers to change their behaviour.In 2013, the maker of consumer household products such as Kleenex tissues, Andrex toilet paper and Huggies nappies set up a digital innovation laboratory (D’-Lab) to scour the globe for likely contenders. The company is based in Irving, Texas, but the virtual D’-Lab team is split between Chicago and Tel Aviv, Israel.Mayur Gupta, the company’s global head of marketing technology and innovation, says marketing has moved on from the brand-led days when toilet tissue was “soft” or detergent would “wash whiter”.“Marketing is now customer-led and customer-driven. What matters is our ability to give them what they need even before they know they need it, rather than push our own ideas in their direction, as we used to,” he says.Moreover, customers want a seamless and consistent experience. For example, if they shop online and get a coupon, they expect to be able to walk into a retail store and use it, says Mr Gupta, though at present “that often does not happen”, he admits.Digital technology is crucial in putting customers in touch with products, yet, Mr Gupta acknowledges: “No single solution meets all the needs of marketing, including data, customer relationship management, ecommerce and mobile.”One way D’-Lab finds start-ups to work with is by staging a competition at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) which takes place in Las Vegas every January.Last year’s winner was a video creation application called Sympler, which lets people express themselves through a video and music track customisation tool. It was used in a commercial programme for the company’s Kotex feminine hygiene brand, and an artist community was invited to create music videos and post them online.“People could express themselves through this type of content, and we became more relevant,” says Mr Gupta.Other D’-Lab ideas on show at this year’s CES included SCiO, designed by Tel Aviv-based Consumer Physics. The handheld sensor can analyse the make-up of physical matter, such as food or medicine. It can scan surfaces for germs and microbes, and might offer consumer benefits for family care products such as Kleenex, Scott and Viva.Evoz, devised by the Los Altos, California-based company of the same name, is a platform that can monitor a baby, play lullabies and control thermostats and lighting. It can also track the amount of nappies in a Huggies dispenser and automatically reorder when stocks are low.Another application, Interlude, created by Yoni Bloch, an Israeli musician and self-proclaimed tech geek, supplies an interactive video system that lets viewers select which parts of a video they want to watch. For example, a women in a store or viewing online could discreetly look for information about feminine hygiene products. Interlude the company is headquartered in New York.“Online video is already driving ecommerce sales,” says Mr Gupta. “We are only a step away from replicating that experience on television.”With interactive video, for example, you can pause an advertisement and click for further information, while data tracking will allow the company to see which parts of a video consumers chose to view.
29;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2015-04-26T14:54:59Z;Apple set to be latest to suffer dollar impact;Currency strength set to wipe more than $2bn from quarterly sales;A surge in the US dollar has already wiped more than $20bn from first quarter sales at the largest US companies, a sum larger than revenues generated by Intel, Caterpillar or Goldman Sachs in the first three months of the year, according to an analysis by the Financial Times.With the US earnings season approaching the halfway stage, that figure is likely to jump further. Apple, the world’s most valuable company, reports results on Monday and warned in January that the currency move could slice more than $2bn from quarterly revenues.So far during the current reporting period, General Motors, IBM, Procter & Gamble, Amazon and Johnson & Johnson have experienced $1bn-plus haircuts on sales as they translated revenues earned abroad back into US dollar terms.Known as “top-line growth”, revenues reflect how quickly a business is growing. In recent years, large multinational US company’s sales have benefited from the combination of a weaker dollar and robust expansion across emerging market economies.However, a sustained rise in the dollar since last summer and weakening global activity has weighed heavily on a host of blue-chip US companies.While 71 per cent of S&P 500 companies have eclipsed first-quarter earnings expectations, 55 per cent of corporates have failed to beat revenue forecasts, according to S&P Capital IQ.“Top-line growth is incredibly challenged. The dollar is even a bigger problem than people thought,’’ said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG.However, US equities indices have reclaimed record territory, with investors cheered by overall earnings topping lowered expectations of analysts. The S&P 500 closed last week at a new peak of 2,117.69, while the Nasdaq has surpassed the dotcom bubble high set in 2000.“While earnings are not great, they’re better than expected,’’ said Mr Greenhaus.The analysis of earnings statements, slide presentations, conference calls and executive commentary spanned more than 100 of the roughly 190 S&P 500 constituents that have reported first-quarter results.The FT analysis showed a $20.1bn reduction in sales, which would have lifted the groups’ reported revenues of $762bn by 2.6 per cent. When excluding financials, sales would have been more than 3 per cent higher. While the technology industry has been particularly exposed to the shift in the dollar — it generates more of its sales abroad than any other sector — a broad swath of companies have warned of the effects.$20.1bnReduction in sales of the more than 100 S&P 500 constituents that have reported so farMcDonald’s, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Tyco, Coca-Cola, Kimberly-Clark, 3M, Caterpillar and PepsiCo were among the dozens that pointed to currency swings when delivering results.“Currency has been powerful headwind for all multinational companies,” said Dan Kelley, portfolio manager at Fidelity. “It is something companies are having to think differently about — what the implications are going forward and whether it makes sense to alter their cost structures.”Only half of the companies disclosed enough information to calculate the dollar’s effect on sales — itself a somewhat nebulous figure as executives must consider changes to underlying operations, volume of goods sold and divestitures or acquisitions along with foreign exchange swings.
30;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2014-12-05T12:45:06Z;Let’s all do the corporate hokey-cokey;Companies that grew by merger are now rushing to split themselves up;There seems to have been an outbreak of the hokey-cokey participation dance song among companies lately. You know, the one where you put your right hand in, take your right hand out, shake it all about and so on.The most prominent tendency lately seems to be to split companies into smaller enterprises, predominantly in the US but also closer to home. Even in the limited number of sectors and companies in which Fundsmith seeks to invest, there has been a rush to demerge. Just this week, Unilever announced the spin-off of its spreads business, but we have also seen:● ADP, the payroll company, spin off its car dealership software business CDK● eBay’s announcement that it will separate its Marketplaces and PayPal businesses● Kimberly-Clark, the tissue and nappy manufacturer, planning to spin off its healthcare business● Procter & Gamble announcing its intention to spin off its Duracell battery business and then selling it to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway● Reckitt Benckiser’s decision to float its pharmaceutical business, to be called IndiviorAnd just to maintain the symmetry of the song, Coca-Cola is going through one of its periodic volte-faces on whether it is good or bad for it to own its bottlers by buying back stakes in them, many of which it had previously sold. It seems that sometimes not owning bottlers is good because it is a capital intensive, low return business. At other times it is essential to own them in order to control distribution. Coke is so bipolar on this issue that it could perform the corporate M&A Hokey Cokey all on its own.In some cases the urge to demerge seems to result from the conclusion that the company had two or more completely different businesses which did not produce any synergies and might have better futures and/or higher valuations apart from each other. One might wonder why this thought did not occur to anyone when the businesses were being acquired. Part of the answer lies in so-called shareholder activism.Activism can take many forms and mean different things but often it involves a shareholder buying a stake in a company and then agitating for change, either via the media or through corporate governance channels.Sometimes that change does not involve separating a company into smaller component businesses, but rather it aims to get the company to put itself up for sale. We saw this in 2011 when veteran US activist Carl Icahn made a bid for Clorox, the US household cleaning products company, in an effort to get them to sell themselves. More recently we have seen an activist make a public appeal to the board of InterContinental Hotels to put the company up for sale.Read more articles by FT Money’s columnistActivism definitely has a role in promoting shareholders’ interests but too often it involves an attempt by the activist to get the company to do a deal which will generate some attention among the analytical community and so enable the activist to sell its stake at a profit. All very exciting, but not of much use to long-term shareholders like us who are left with holdings in fragmented businesses, often with new management teams and strained balance sheets. Then there are the huge frictional costs of separation fees to investment bankers, lawyers, accountants and others — followed by financial statements that contain so many adjustments that they border on the incomprehensible.But sometimes seemingly frenetic merger and demerger activity is dreamt up by the management of the company all by itself. A classic case is Mondelez. It is the product of Kraft’s controversial takeover of Cadbury in 2010, which was followed just two years later by the demerger of Kraft and Mondelez which consisted of Cadbury plus Kraft’s snack businesses. Hardly any analysts queried why it was a good idea to demerge two businesses which it had only combined two years previously, and if you can follow the logic in all of this you are ahead of me.The result of Kraft’s hyperactivity was that the 2013 results for Mondelez — the first post-demerger — contained 19 schedules of adjustments and reconciliations to its reported numbers. This legerdemain had not ceased by the first quarter of 2014, when it gave 11 adjustments, magically turning reported growth of operating profits from 1.1 per cent to 15.8 per cent. And for my next trick . . .There have of course been the usual restructuring programmes and integration programmes, and the Hokey Cokey activity has not slackened with the announcement this year that Mondelez is now spinning out its coffee business into a joint venture with D.E. Master Blenders called Jacobs Douwe Egberts.At least all this is bullish for investment bankers’ bonuses.Terry Smith is chief executive of Fundsmith LLP
31;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2014-09-19T03:52:23Z;China’s nappy brands look to absorb local demand;;"From toothpaste to ice cream to disposable nappies, modern Chinese life has been transformed by imports. But many of those erstwhile alien products now bear Chinese brand names.More and more mainlanders are brushing their teeth with Yunnan Baiyao toothpaste, eating Yili ice cream or putting nappies made by Hengan on their babies. Multinationals still have a strong sometimes dominant presence in these markets, but mainland brands are exploiting local knowhow and speed to market.Disposable nappies are a case in point: many Chinese grannies did not use them to raise the current generation, but today’s urban mainland mums rely on them.The market in China is highly concentrated, with 10 brands capturing 85 per cent of sales. Only one local brand has significant share: Hengan with 9 per cent, compared with 10 per cent for Kimberly-Clark of the US and nearly 29 per cent for Procter & Gamble.But the rapid rise in urbanisation and incomes in China is boosting demand for products such as nappies. Euromonitor, the data group, predicts that the world’s largest nappy market will nearly triple between 2010 and 2017, from Rmb20bn ($3.3bn) to Rmb57bn ($9.3bn).Such growth is attracting new entrants, many of them local brands. “It is estimated there will be more than 100 foreign and domestic brands that will enter China in 2014 alone,” says Liu Yang, chief executive of Xiaolu Dingding Diapers, a mainland brand.Rising costs of materials and labour, changing consumer tastes and increasingly demanding consumers have made market conditions increasingly tough, retail analyst say. Hengan warned in its most recent results that “the short-term outlook remains challenging as a lot of players have entered into this market”.Hengan says the quality of its nappies equals that of the foreign brands – P&G, Kimberly-Clark and Japanese brand Unicharm together have more than half the market – but many mainland consumers disagree.Hengan, which expects to sell Rmb2.8bn-Rmb3bn of its Anerle nappies this year, says: “A majority of Chinese mothers believe foreign products are better than domestic ones; therefore, it is necessary to educate consumers to change their minds.”Persuading Chinese mothers to use disposable nappies has been a slow process, says Xu Ruyi, head of China research at Mintel. “Nappies were introduced to China by P&G during the 1990s and it has taken a long time for consumers to adopt the products.”One breakthrough came with P&G’s Pampers “golden sleep” campaign in 2007, focused on convincing mothers that using nappies can help babies sleep better, “which means they can grow faster and get more brain development”, says Ms Xu.However, China is not a captive market for multinationals. “Competition is intense: even for big players if you don’t keep up with the competition you’ll still lose share to others,” says Ms Xu. “Consumers today are offered a much wider range of product choices compared with five or 10 years ago.”Pull-up-type nappies, nappies for boys versus girls and adult nappies are all relatively new entrants to the market – the latter category is expected to grow strongly in China, the world’s largest senior market.Domestic brands are “focusing more on R&D and updating their production equipment because the newer the production line, the better quality the nappies will be”, says Yan Fei of Beijing’s Qinbei Research Centre.“Intelligent” nappies, which gauge the health of a baby from its urine, and mosquito repellent nappies are under development by Chinese companies.Research from Mintel shows that famous brand names may actually wield less power in China than elsewhere. In the UK, says Mintel, “45 per cent of parents would go for a product they’ve used before and a low price is among the top three influencing factors”.But in China, quality is king: freedom from harmful substances, quality, suitability for sensitive skin and absorbency are most important for Chinese consumers, says Ms Xu.China’s birth rate may be low, but spending on only babies is a favourite pastime and Chinese mothers sometimes use up to 20 nappies per day to avoid nappy rash, says Mr Yan.Big-city mothers have more and more money to spend on nappies and small city mums are just beginning to think of using them.Like toothpaste and ice cream, nappies are becoming a domestic necessity in China, and everyone from local to multinational brands is eager to get a piece of the action.Public toilet training falls from fashionIn the west it is called “elimination communication” but in China it is merely called tradition: put the baby over the bowl and watch it urinate or defecate, preferably on cue from a parent.For centuries, Chinese mothers and grandmothers used this method to “toilet train” infants virtually from birth, Chinese infants were encouraged to eliminate waste on command, often urged on by a gentle “shushing” sound.This technique, still widely practised in rural China, largely eliminates the need for nappies. Toddlers wearing “split pants” can be seen on the streets of China’s cities, being held over a gutter or rubbish bin when caught short in public.Some parents even brave international air travel without benefit of nappies: this YouTube video, narrated by a Malaysian advocate of the practice, explains how it is done.The practice has a niche following in the west, where it is seen as a way to improve bonding between parent and child, reduce struggles over toilet training and cut nappy rash.According to the US website www.diaperfreebaby.org, “babies are aware of their elimination needs from birth and communicate about those needs through various vocal and bodily signals”.“Within the first few months of life, babies have the ability to consciously release their bladders and bowels,” the website says. Some childcare experts say the practice is more parent training than toilet training: the key is teaching the parent to recognise when the child needs to go.Advocates say “elimination communication” lowers the age at which infants learn to use the toilet independently, and also reduces the environmental impact of disposable nappies. But it is a rare urban parent in China today who chooses to stick to the traditional method.Additional reporting by Zhang Yan"
32;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Businesses target $1.2tn US Hispanic market;;The world’s biggest consumer goods companies are applying lessons from Latin America to their sales strategies in the US, as they try to woo the country’s 53m Hispanic consumers, whose spending power now tops $1tn.Products ranging from Clorox bleach to Kimberly-Clark’s Huggies nappies and Nestlé hot chocolate are now being tailored to Hispanic tastes using knowledge the companies have gleaned in Mexico and elsewhere.Hispanic people are the US’s largest ethnic minority, accounting for 17 per cent of the population, according to the Census Bureau. They are expected to reach 31 per cent – or 129m people – by 2060.Until recently, many companies had sold generic products to US Hispanics without doing anything specific to cultivate them.But as economic growth in the developing world slows, companies are becoming more eager to win extra business from the group, which some see as an emerging market within the world’s biggest economy.After Clorox research found that many Hispanics favour fragranced household products, which they associate with cleanliness, it introduced the heavily scented Fraganzia cleaning range in the US last year.It drew on the perfume expertise of its Poett brand in Argentina and its Mistolín cleaners in Venezuela and Puerto Rico – but David Cardona, director of multicultural sales at California-based Clorox, said simply importing unmodified products from Latin America to the US was not enough.“One of the things we’re very good at is leveraging our strength in Latin America to inform . . . the things we should be doing here in the US,” he told the Financial Times.Clorox’s research concluded that in the product categories where it competes, which include rubbish bags and charcoal, Hispanic consumers would account for more than 50 per cent of the increase in US sales between 2010 and 2020.Nestlé began importing Abuelita hot chocolate and La Lechera condensed milk to the US from Mexico in the 1990s. However, Carlos Velasco, president of its international brands division, says it also has to develop new innovations to keep the brands relevant to “acculturated” Mexican-Americans as well as non-Hispanics.It offers Abuelita as a quick-stir powder for busy consumers who do not have time to use its traditional chocolate tablet, which can take up to 15 minutes to make a drink. Under the La Lechera name, it is now selling baking kits for Mexican-style cheesecakes.Huggies, made by Kimberly-Clark of Texas, is the market leader in nappies in Mexico and Lizette Williams, senior brand manager for multicultural strategy, said that position had helped it secure the biggest market share among US Hispanics.“It really plays to our benefit when we think about the growing Mexican population in the US,” she said, citing the popularity of baby wipes scented with green tea and cucumber, which Huggies introduced in the US last year.The buying power of US Hispanics was $1.2tn in 2012, more than the gross domestic product of all but 13 national economies, according to the Selig Center at the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business. Almost two-thirds of US Hispanics have Mexican origins.The gap between consumer behaviour among Latin Americans and US Hispanics has grown in recent years as people born in the US – not immigrants – have become the main drivers of Latino population growth.

Territory: Argentina
Verdict: 4/5“Pregnancy was always about her,” croons the voiceover of the Huggies advert being aired on YouTube and social media. No longer. Now dads can literally get a kick out of it too.A specially designed belly for expectant fathers to wear, conceived by Ogilvy & Mather Argentina for the nappy maker and tested by teary-eyed real couples, mimics baby’s real-time kicks and movements via sensors from a belt strapped over mum’s bump.The underlying idea is simple: bond with the brand before baby is even born and needing all the other paraphernalia Huggies can dream up. This includes TweetPee, a sensor that tweets to tell parents when a nappy needs changing, how many baby uses and when to buy more.The device is still a prototype, and for some dads the idea of simulated baby kicks is too weird for words. But Huggies, which timed the ad to coincide with Father’s Day and is also airing a Spanish version, sees it as a way to “compensate” fathers, “because they’re pregnant too”.Mind you, many men are probably still more than happy to miss out on morning sickness and stretch marks, not to mention the actual birthing . . ."
34;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Kimberly-Clark comes to Venezuela’s (toilet paper) rescue;;"Conveniently for Nicolas Maduro, whose fledgling presidency has been marred by nationwide shortages of loo paper (amongst a host of other things), someone is about to lend a helping hand.Less conveniently for Venezuela’s new leader – and for the socialist, anti-imperialist discourse that he touts – that someone is a major US corporation, Kimberly-Clark, which is planning to invest $37m to expand its operations in the Bolivarian republic.Kimberly-Clark controls 15 per cent of Venezuela’s market for toilet paper, but the investment, which will be made over the next 6 to 24 months, is expected to boost its local capacity by 30 to 40 per cent.“When the shortages occurred, the productive sector, together with the government, designed a strategy to combat it. Now things are fine,” assured trade minister Alejandro Fleming after a meeting with representatives from Kimberly-Clark. At least he admitted that there has been a problem at all, which is more than can be said for other officials earlier this year.Certainly, Kimberly-Clark’s investment should go some way to making life easier for those Venezuelans that care for personal hygiene, even if the solution doesn’t sit comfortably with the tirades of the late Hugo Chavez (whose discourse Maduro has attempted to imitate, with varying degrees of success) against capitalist corporations.The more radical elements of Maduro’s government may be smarting that the state wasn’t able to resolve the problem by itself, but the agreement with Kimberly-Clark is not the first of its kind.The government is already believed to be considering a deal with Venezuela’s largest private company, Polar, for its help with running food processing plants that are not exactly flourishing under state control. Could a trend be developing?Either way, it will help Kimberly-Clark to get rid of some of the cash it has trapped in Venezuela thanks to currency controls, which will only lose value in this high-inflation environment, especially if another devaluation is around the corner, as some fear.Related reading:

35;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2013-05-22T15:08:22Z;Marketing the unpleasant truth;Brands are adopting a franker approach to advertising personal products, writes Rhymer Rigby;In a recent British television advertisement for the mouthwash Corsodyl, an attractive model is filmed in modish, sepia tones getting ready for a night out. Suddenly she starts bleeding from her eye and the voiceover says: “We wouldn’t ignore blood from any other part of our body so why do we ignore it from our gums?”The model then spits a mouthful of bloody toothpaste into the sink and the narrator explains that spitting blood is an early sign of gum disease, which can lead to tooth loss. The spot finishes with the model looking in the mirror and revealing that a tooth is missing. In other parts of the campaign, the product even uses the tagline “Corsodyl: for people who spit blood when they brush their teeth”.Chris Hirst, chief executive of Grey London, the agency behind Corsodyl’s campaign, says the idea was to be honest about the product without being sensationalist. “The ad deals with an unpleasant subject – and the image jolts you,” he explains. “But I think it’s OK. The blood is relevant to what the product does, it’s not breaking a social taboo, and it’s not shock for shock’s sake. So you don’t feel short-changed or tricked.”The campaign’s in-your-face bluntness is in sharp contrast to what consumers have come to expect in marketing campaigns for products that deal with sensitive issues. From feminine sanitary products to toilet paper, the traditional response from companies has been to largely ignore the product and concentrate on showing people having lots of fun while using it. The item itself is only ever shown in a clinical, laboratory-type environment. But recently, some advertisers have started pushing the “yuck” envelope both by using humour and by being frank.In 1999, Zovirax, the cold-sore cream, launched a long-running campaign featuring a woman wearing a motorcycle helmet to go swimming, to visit the gym and so on. The campaign was humorous and in some of the ads a cold sore was even shown – although it did appear to be a rather toned-down, television-friendly sore.More recently, in 2010, Kotex, the female hygiene products company, took aim at traditional tampon advertising with an ad that had a woman sarcastically discussing her menstrual cycle: “How do I feel about my period? I love it . . . ” The slot concludes by asking: “Why are tampon ads so ridiculous?”Last year Bodyform, another female hygiene products maker whose ads famously show women skydiving, mountain biking and horse riding during their menstrual cycle, sent itself up in a well-received viral ad. In response to a Facebook post by a male consumer who claimed the cheery, active commercials had deceived him, the company released a spot featuring a fictitious chief executive who admits that it has not been completely honest because “some people simply can’t handle the truth”. It has been viewed more than 3.8m times on YouTube.Tanya Hamilton-Smith, business director of JWT, the advertising agency whose clients include Kimberly-Clark, the US-based personal care corporation, says dealing with somewhat unsavoury products is nothing new. “We have a lot of products like these and are continually faced with ‘icky’ subjects,” she says.But Patrick Barwise, emeritus professor of management and marketing at London Business School, says the advertising of such products is always a challenge. “One general principle is that all publicity is good publicity. But another is that you avoid negative emotions,” he says. “If you look at charities, they struggle with this all the time. If you make people feel bad, you get their attention, but they may not contribute – so successful campaigns tend to be emotionally positive.”Controversial commercials are not always the ones that cause the most offence.Each year, the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority releases a list of its most complained about commercials. The top spot in the ASA’s 50 year history was a KFC ad that showed people singing with their mouths open. Last year, the most complained about campaign was the online price comparison site Go Compare’s campaign featuring an opera singer.In Australia, one of the most complained about ads in 2012 was a Red Bull commercial making fun of Jesus walking on water.While it may be possible to make an argument for courting controversy by being disgusting, annoying and even poking fun at religion, it is very hard to see what some ads thought they were doing. PopChips, the snack company, put out a viral ad last year featuring actor Ashton Kutcher with a brown face, pretending to be a Bollywood producer. After strong criticism, the ad was pulled.He adds that even pretesting adverts may not give you a definitive answer. “If you test commercials, you have to ask questions and in doing so, you get people’s interpretations of their reactions. The US tends to be more pro-testing than the UK, where the view is that if no one hates your campaign it’s very unlikely to be a great campaign.”One of Kimberly-Clark’s brands is the UK toilet paper Andrex whose ads have featured labrador puppies at play since 1972. Recently, it decided to try a different tack in order to speak to a younger audienceand push itself to the top of consumers’ minds. So it launched a campaign called “Scrunch or Fold?” asking consumers if they scrunched or folded their toilet paper after use and inviting them to register their answer in an online poll. “People are becoming more accepting of talking about these products, and even willing to have a bit of fun, although the rise of social media also means they’re far more outspoken,” says Ms Hamilton-Smith.The Andrex campaign sparked a great deal of debate – but much of it was negative. Helen Edwards, a columnist for Marketing Magazine, described it as “one of the saddest and most insane acts of brand self-harm ever conceived”.Even the edgy, controversy-friendly media group Vice weighed in, declaring it “the worst advertising campaign ever”.Jordi Connor, head of planning at Dialogue, a marketing agency, was also critical. “I found it bizarre on a number of levels,” he says. “Andrex has a great brand with great awareness. Then they do something totally out of character. Why do we need to have this discussion?”So why do brands choose such a blunt approach, especially when they have a successful strategy?Ms Hamilton-Smith says despite the “negative reaction, there has also been a big positive reaction”. She points out that once many people discovered the online polls, they decided it was fun. “We’ve had a huge level of response and even those who were negative couldn’t help but engage in the debate.”Kimberly-Clark says the campaign has provided a boost in customer awareness and that early indicators suggest an uplift in sales, including promotions, of 22 per cent.“Overall we’ve been very pleased with it,” says Carrie Stanley, commercial programme manager for Andrex. Although she admits that “about 10 per cent of the population who skewed towards middle-aged to older men didn’t like the subject matter of the campaign and were very vocal about it”.Despite this apparent return on investment, Ms Hamilton-Smith adds a note of caution: “There’s a very fine balance with these campaigns – and Scrunch or Fold probably pushed it as far as UK customers are willing to go.”
36;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Brazil’s Évora eyes Chinese nappy market;;"Chinese babies and incontinent Europeans may not sound like they have much in common but they’re the two major driving forces behind a market that’s now worth $44.4bn.Infant and adult disposable nappies are big business these days. While the developing world is moving away from traditional non-disposable potty training products, the developed world is simultaneously ageing to the point of losing bladder control.This is all great news for Évora, the Brazilian company that ranks as one of the world’s biggest makers of the ‘nonwoven fabric’ that is used to make nappies and other hygiene products.In fact, Évora’s chief executive, Geraldo Enck, expects the global nonwovens industry to grow at about 4 to 5 per cent every year until 2016.While Évora also makes plastic lids as well as aluminium cans in a joint venture with US-based Crown Holdings, nappies is where Enck sees the most room for international expansion.Fitesa, as Évora’s nonwovens business is called, last year completed the acquisition of the nonwovens division of UK-based Fiberweb and now has plants in the US, Peru, Mexico, Italy, Sweden Germany, and China, as well as Brazil. (Being close to the final customer is key in the nappy market, given that the bulky nature of the product makes it expensive to ship).With the acquisition, Fitesa increased its net revenue by 131 per cent to R$1.2bn last year from 2011.Last week, holding company Évora even changed its name from Petropar to help better market its brand abroad. In the fluffy world of Huggies and Pampers, Petropar was just not cutting it, it seems.Brazil’s own market offers great potential – outside the large cities and in the country’s poorer northern regions many parents still only buy their children disposable nappies for ‘special occasions’ such as parties or long bus journeys.But what really gets Enck excited is China:In China the percentage of babies using disposable nappies is about 27 per cent. With such a huge population and the effect of rising incomes there is a lot of potential. There are also opportunities in India and Indonesia. Judging by the number of children born and income per capita, there are significant growth opportunities for us in these countries.However, China is a tough nappy market for Évora’s clients. Many parents still favour the local toilet training method (pants with a hole), and those who don’t, have largely been won over by the Mamy Poko Pants made by Japan’s Unicharm group.The good news is that while Évora’s nappy-making unit does battle over China, the company can still rely on Europe and the US to boost revenues.This from Enck:The market for adult nappies is growing at double digits in Europe and the US. People in these regions are living longer and so there is an increasing need for incontinence nappies. They are also in an income bracket that allows them to buy such disposable products. However, demand can vary from country to country. Sometimes there is a nationwide directive, advocating the use of disposable adult nappies, which further increases sales.Related reading:

37;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2013-04-19T18:18:57Z;Kimberly-Clark: mopping up;Company meets the gritty needs of its customers – and fearful investors;Cast your eyes over Kimberly-Clark’s product portfolio and see your whole dreary life spooling out before you. Millions of dirty nappies. Uncounted messes mopped with paper towels. Decades of noses blown into tissues. Discreet, absorbent undergarments in which to shuffle about the old folks’ home. Finally, the disposable masks and gowns worn by the hospital staff as they see you into the next world.Companies that meet gritty human needs have been popular with investors recently and Kimberly-Clark has done particularly well. Its shares have returned nearly 75 per cent over two years, whipping the broader market and consumer stocks generally. The company’s desirable characteristics include a large and stable dividend (capturing erstwhile fixed-income investors as they flee low bond yields) and staple products that appeal to stock investors still frightened about the economy. Kimberly-Clark reliably converts all of its earnings into cash, which it then spends on dividends and share buybacks (and the odd acquisition). The company’s first-quarter results, released on Friday, were characteristically solid: sales and profits ahead of expectations and a slight bump up for the earnings outlook. The stock gained 4 per cent.Cautious investors might grow a little jumpy about the valuation at which Kimberly-Clark now trades, however. The ratio of its price to its forward earnings is approaching 19, a level last seen at the feverish turn of the century. That is not out of line with peers but the similarly prosaic and reliable companies Walmart and McDonald’s can be had at ratios of 15 and 17, respectively. And this is a company that grows somewhere between very little and not at all. Between 2007 and 2012 its sales and operating profit both grew at an inflation-like, sub-3 per cent average annual rate. The company has managed to keep its earnings per share growing faster by reducing its share count.Bulls on the shares will probably defend the valuation with the line taken by bulls on the market generally: with central bankers in a wild monetary-easing contest, where else to put your money, except shares backed by stable businesses? Pass those tissues. It’s time to cry.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
38;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2013-03-18T20:28:00Z;US bank stocks suffer in Cyprus sell-off;;"Bank stocks took the biggest beating as investors pulled back from US equities in case of a new flare-up in the eurozone crisis, though the worst fears of traders eased as the day progressed.Citigroup lost 2.2 per cent to close at $46.24, Morgan Stanley was 2.5 per cent lower at $22.99 and JPMorgan Chase was down 1.0 per cent at $49.51. Bank of America rebounded to end just 0.1 per cent lower at $12.576.The trigger for the sell-off was the terms of the bailout of Cyprus, where bank depositors will be hit with a tax of up to 9.9 per cent. The tax is a new kind of austerity measure that some observers worried could lead to a run on the banks in other eurozone periphery countries, if savers believe they too could become a cash-raising target.However, the make-up of bank deposits in Cyprus, notably from Russian sources, suggested to some traders it may prove a unique case. There were also suggestions that the tax could yet be made less onerous for small savers.The S&P 500 recovered a portion of its early losses to close down 0.6 per cent at 1,552.10, still within spitting distance of the 1,565 record it set in 2007. On the Nasdaq Composite, where technology stocks dominate the index, the loss was 0.4 per cent, taking the index to 3,237.59. Telecoms and information technology stocks were the only sectors in positive territory.Apple shares were a bright spot, up 2.7 per cent at $455.72. Moody’s, the rating agency, said the iPad maker could have as much as $170bn cash on its books by the end of the year, up from $137bn, and representing 11 per cent of all the cash on all US companies’ balance sheets.Goldman Sachs was telling its clients to sell shares of Kimberly-Clark, the consumer goods giant that makes Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, warning that increasing competition from Procter & Gamble and rising raw materials costs would hurt margins.“We suggest taking gains at a historical relative valuation peak,” said Goldman analyst Jason English. Kimberly-Clark shares were down 0.4 per cent to $92.90; P&G was off 0.2 per cent at $76.16.As European aircraft manufacturer Airbus basked in the glow of a potentially $24bn deal to sell its A320 aircraft to the fast-growing Indonesian carrier Lion Air, announced Monday morning by French President François Hollande, Boeing shares slipped 1.5 per cent to $85.18. It was the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Lion has traditionally been a client of Boeing.JC Penney was the best performing S&P 500 stock, up 6.2 per cent at $16.44 after analysts at ISI floated the idea it could spin off its best 300 stores into a tax-advantaged real estate investment trust. The department store chain has been struggling with poor sales, an unfolding disaster that has alarmed shareholders and bondholders alike.ValueClick, a digital advertising agency, rose 8.5 per cent to $30.12 after analysts at Jefferies reported back positively from a meeting with the company’s management.Charter Communications rose 8.8 per cent to $98.04 on talk that John Malone’s Liberty Media is planning to take a 25 per cent stake in the cable TV operator. Liberty was 0.3 per cent higher at $110.66.Dex One and Supermedia, two directories businesses, were up 11.4 per cent at $2.35 and 10.7 per cent at $4.88, respectively. The pair failed to win bondholder support for their merger plan and each has therefore filed for bankruptcy protection, but speculators saw the pre-planned move as a fresh start with potential benefits for shareholders.Reports that the US authorities have been investigating an allegation of bribery by Wall Street Journal reporters in China was a reminder of the legal troubles still facing the newspaper’s owner, News Corp. The company denied the allegation, and it is not clear if the US Department of Justice has taken it at all seriously. News Corp has been under investigation in the US since revelations of phone-hacking and payments to police by journalists on its UK newspapers, including the now-shuttered News of the World. The stock fell 0.7 per cent to $30.16."
39;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2013-02-11T19:10:10Z;Companies hit by Venezuela move;;Colgate-Palmolive, the toothpaste and soap maker, will suffer a one-off $120m loss as a result of Venezuela’s currency devaluation, which is also posing a threat to the earnings of other US and European multinationals.The Venezuelan government said it would devalue its currency by 32 per cent on Friday in a long-expected move to alleviate a growing fiscal deficit and shortages of foreign currency.The official exchange rate for Venezuela’s bolívar is expected to move from 4.3 per dollar to 6.3 per dollar on February 13.Colgate, which gets roughly 5 per cent of its sales from Venezuela, said on Monday that the $120m post-tax loss would result from the translation of its financial statements at the new rate. Its shares fell 0.2 per cent to $108.29 on Monday.Procter & Gamble, a Colgate rival with a Venezuelan business, said: “We’re looking at the impact and evaluating it.” Avon, the door-to-door cosmetics group that operates in the country, declined to comment ahead of its earnings on Tuesday.Edenred, a French catering and services business, said on Monday the devaluation would reduce its 2013 revenue by 1.3 per cent and cut its earnings before interest and tax for the year by 2.4 per cent.Multinationals are already facing restrictions on repatriating dividends, which were introduced in 2009 and have left some $13bn in dividends trapped in the country, according to Asdrubal Oliveros, a local economist. If the dividends are recognised at the new exchange rate, their dollar value would fall by some $4.1bn.The Venezuelan operations of several Spanish companies leave them exposed to the devaluation, including Telefónica, the telecoms group, and BBVA, Spain’s second-largest bank by assets.Other multinationals with Venezuelan operations include the oil groups Chevron, Repsol, Statoil and Eni, consumer goods groups Kimberly-Clark, Kraft and Diageo, and Cargill, the commodities trader.Colgate’s expected loss would be equivalent to 25 cents per share. The New York-based group is expected to report earnings per share of $1.27 for the quarter to the end of March, according to consensus estimates by Bloomberg.The company said it expected to feel the effects of the devaluation throughout the year, warning that it was likely to reduce earnings per share by between 5 cents and 7 cents per quarter in 2013.Although the devaluation is expected to ease pressure on Venezuela’s strained public finances, it is also likely to fuel inflation, which is running at about 20 per cent.BBVA’s Venezuelan operation accounts for about 5 per cent of its earnings, according to analysts at Banco Portugues de Investimento.Telefónica earns 6.5 per cent of its operating profit from Venezuela, according to its most recent results, and is the country’s largest mobile operator under its Movistar brand.
40;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2013-01-10T19:17:19Z;Talk of ‘shirkers’ echoes Victorian past;UK coalition is distorting the welfare state, says Tristram Hunt;"Kill me sooner than take me there,” cried Betty Higden, in Charles Dickens’s Our Mutual Friend, when faced with the prospect of the workhouse. Critics of the government’s welfare reform bill suggest we are on the verge of another New Poor Law and its spoonfuls of thin gruel. Certainly, the real-term cut to benefit rates has the whiff of “less eligibility” about it: the maxim that life in the workhouse had to be more unbearable than the lowest form of paid employment.But if the Dickensian caricature is too much, then the debate about how to cut back Britain’s spiralling social security system is nevertheless replete with echoes of the past. The language of “workers” versus “shirkers” is a straight lift from the mid-Victorian moralism of deserving and undeserving poor. Yet the most unfortunate rhetoric involves the return of “character” as the critical determinant of poverty.Chancellor George Osborne likes to contrast the “shift worker, leaving home in the dark hours of the early morning” with his feckless neighbour, behind closed blinds, “sleeping off a life on benefits”.John Redwood, Mr Osborne’s parliamentary colleague, has similarly identified a lack of moral fibre among the poor, which is why they gamble so much. Whereas poor people “ put getting rich down to luck and think they can take a gamble”, the honest strivers of his stockbroker-belt Wokingham constituency “are too busy working hard to make a reasonable income”.This was the prejudice that first spurred Charles Booth, the Liverpool shipping magnate, to investigate the causes of poverty in 1880s London. Dismissive of socialist claims of mass unemployment, he established a network of researchers to pick over the lives of the poor.It was a pioneering sociological investigation designed to prove Booth right: that poverty was limited and the poor were poor because of their alcoholism, lust or dislike of work. Those were the days when Samuel Smiles’s Self-Help provided the Victorian answer to inequality, and the wretchedness of Jack the Ripper’s Whitechapel was put down to ingrained immorality.In fact, Booth’s study revealed that circumstance not character dictated poverty. Yes, there were shirkers but more than 100 years ago he showed that “habits” accounted for a much smaller share of poverty than did job opportunities and family size. In an east London economy hammered by the collapse of the shipbuilding industry, employment levels, much more than self-reliance, shaped community prospects.As so many Keynesians tell today’s coalition, it’s no good blaming the unemployed for a flatlining economy stripped of demand. Or as Martin Vickers, Tory MP for Cleethorpes, where 500 jobs will be lost when the Kimberly-Clark nappy company closes a plant, admits: “Some people in my constituency …will be on benefits for a few months; in no sense will they be scroungers.”Booth’s study formed an important part of that New Liberal moment when Victorian laisser faire was exchanged for an interventionist state. In its wake came national insurance and the old-age pension.But for another early 1900s social investigator, it was not enough. William Beveridge was also a product of the East End, discovering the poor while volunteering at the Toynbee Hall settlement house. He became convinced that traditional ways of alleviating poverty – patronising charity; medical boards; and prison – offered neither dignity nor self-improvement. In 1942, he provided his own answer with the Beveridge report.Underpinning it was the economics of full employment, but his political philosophy was a concerted rejection of “deserving” versus “undeserving”. In place of patchwork provision, Beveridge urged universal coverage based on a flat-rate contribution and equality of benefit. It was a democratic and progressive vision of common citizenship, building on the unity of purpose the British people had displayed during the war.And because a service just for the poor usually meant a poor service, Beveridge urged middle-class involvement. The danger posed by this week’s withdrawal of child-benefit for upper-earners is that it threatens to set our system along the road of stigmatised US welfare.If for Beveridge the welfare state was a vehicle for social solidarity, this government uses it as a partisan dividing line. All the hoary old fables of a work-shy, improvident and dissolute residuum are coming back into play as a desperate Treasury fails to deliver on growth. Of course our deficit and demography necessitate welfare reform. But, as Dickens knew, it is always easier to punish the individual poor than improve their collective condition.The writer is a historian and Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent"
41;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2012-10-24T21:44:52Z;Huggies nappy production binned in Europe;;Kimberly-Clark is closing the bulk of its western European Huggies nappy business in a retrenchment likely to involve the US-based personal care company axing up to 1,500 workers.The move is part of a Europe-wide restructuring that will see Kimberly-Clark stop making nappies in western and central Europe, apart from Italy, and divest lower-margin businesses such as tissues.The company said the rejig would cost $250m-$350m after tax, with the bill to hit in 2014. Businesses being ditched generate annual net sales of about $500m and “negligible” operating profit. Lost sales will hit the top line next year.Thomas Falk, chairman and chief executive, said the changes would create a better focus on growth opportunities, improve underlying profitability and “enable more sustainable returns going forward in this part of the world”.He added: “These moves are further evidence of the portfolio management approach we use to run our company and the financial discipline embedded in our global business plan.”News of the European overhaul came as Kimberly-Clark reported a 1 per cent increase in third-quarter sales to $2.4bn. Operating profit in the period rose 10 per cent to $436m.Europe put in the poorest showing, with sales falling 2 per cent, including an unfavourable currency impact of 11 per cent. Sales volumes rose 9 per cent, mostly due to growth in non-branded offerings and Huggies baby wipes.Kimberly-Clark said it would streamline European manufacturing by closing or selling five plants. It expects total workforce reductions to be in a range of 1,300 to 1,500 positions.
42;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2012-07-26T18:40:27Z;Consumer companies – growing pain;Stock markets might be pleased but strong sales growth comes at a price;After recent profit warnings from Procter & Gamble and Danone, investors had much to fear from this week’s earnings reports from consumer goods companies. In the event, it has been smiles all around. Thursday’s first-half results prompted a 6 per cent share price increase at Unilever, while Colgate-Palmolive rose 4 per cent and Kimberly-Clark 3 per cent. The sales outlook is not as bad as many had anticipated. At Unilever, underlying revenue growth of 7 per cent beat forecasts as a strong emerging markets performance offset weakness elsewhere, especially in Europe.But events further down the income statement are more concerning. Consumer goods companies are keeping their revenues moving along at a decent clip, but they are having to work harder to get there. All three of them, along with PepsiCo on Wednesday, reported increases in marketing spend in the first half. Rising commodity prices, especially for oil, also pushed costs up. Unilever’s operating margin slipped by 100 basis points, while Colgate-Palmolive’s was down 30bp and PepsiCo was down 150bp. Only Kimberly-Clark bucked the trend with a 250bp improvement, which was down to lower fibre costs for its nappies and tissues.Across the board, the answer to the margin pressure has been to cut costs. Unilever spent €230m on restructuring in the first half. PepsiCo spent $80m in the second quarter and will spend another $315m over the rest of the year. But cost cutting can only go so far. Unless raw material prices ease, or the global economy recovers sufficiently to allow consumer goods companies to ease back on ad spending, margins will stay under pressure and that eye-catching, emerging markets-driven top line growth will start to look hollow.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
43;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2012-05-21T18:49:43Z;Case study: Kimberly-Clark’s Andean ascent;;The storyIn 2004 Kimberly-Clark, the US company whose brands include Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues, renewed its attempts to set up a pan-Andean regional management structure.An Argentine, Sergio Nacach, became general manager for a market that encompassed Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia and Venezuela. He was charged with boosting growth in sales and profits.Kimberly-Clark’s development in Latin America had come largely through acquisitions. The purchased companies often kept their original management who, having sold the business, were not committed to change or to improving financial performance.The challengeMr Nacach had to battle expectations among the staff.First, earlier efforts to create a pan-Andean management structure had failed because of the autonomy of the acquired units and cultural differences between the countries.Second, the market appeared to have little potential. The countries were relatively poor: some items, such as nappies, were sold in single units because consumers could not afford to buy them in bigger quantities.In addition, the goods – tissues, nappies, feminine hygiene products, paper towels – were humdrum everyday consumer staples.Overall, the assumption was that sales growth would merely match that of personal income.The strategyMr Nacach set out to institute “a winning culture” that focused on employees. Although the idea of building a culture that engaged staff was not new, it was implemented infrequently – especially in Latin America, with its more paternalistic and hierarchical traditions.Mr Nacach instituted several actions, including:● Eliminating status symbols that separated employees from the leadership. This included removing security barriers to the executive floor and making it common practice for everyone to use each other’s first names.● Using newsletters and frequent meetings to share information with everyone, so employees knew how they were doing and what they might do more effectively.● Decision-making was devolved to local units. Now they could tailor their marketing and sales efforts – by responding to regional feast days, for instance.● Organising the company into “geographic business accountabilities”, where people with different roles worked together and were jointly responsible for financial results. This entailed altering the pay structure so that employees were rewarded for overall financial performance in a geographic area.This solved the typical organisational silo problem in which units do not communicate with each other. For example, the marketing department previously rolled out promotions and advertising without telling sales or manufacturing.● Achievements were recognised at fun events. In 2007, for example, a Star Wars-themed awards ceremony in Cusco had everyone in costume.What happenedSales increased from $519m in 2005 to more than $1bn in 2008, while operating income soared from $63m in 2005 to $200m in 2008.The Andean units became more integrated with local communities through charitable projects. This gave employees a sense that their work made a difference to local people as well as to the company.Many leaders in the region also obtained positions in other parts of the company. Most recently, Mr Nacach was appointed head of all Latin American operations.Key lessonsOrganisational culture is a source of competitive advantage in all sectors and all countries, not just high-tech sectors or in the US or western Europe.It is possible to improve results dramatically, even in seemingly mundane businesses.“High-commitment” work practices that touch employees’ hearts and minds invariably make good business sense.The writer is a professor of organisational behaviour at Stanford Graduate School of Business and author of the book The Human Equation: Building Profits by Putting People FirstThis article is based on a Stanford Case Study (Number OB-72) called Kimberly-Clark Andean Region: Creating a Winning Culture
44;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2012-05-20T16:27:49Z;Safety on Wall Street;Though far from Greece, fear is beginning to set into the US equity market;It has recently felt like the final, slow-motion seconds before a car accident: breaking, skidding, the other car floating closer, a sense of unreality and the hope that the impact will never come. Saturday’s G8 declaration offered no help whatsoever. It is increasingly possible that Greece will exit the eurozone and, if it does, the repercussions – barring extremely aggressive action by the European Central Bank – will be hugely nasty.Investors in markets one small ocean away, in the US, seem to think they can slip by unharmed. The S&P 500, for example, is a mere 8 per cent down from its recent peak six weeks ago and the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio remains high. Still, a more granular look at the equity market shows that fear is beginning to set in. Of the 20 big-cap ($10bn and over) US and Canadian stocks that have performed best in the recent pullback, six are utilities or their cousins the pipeline companies, according to CapitalIQ data. Many of the others are classic defensives as well: Hershey, Verizon, Kimberly-Clark and so on.Utilities look like the easy trade here. During the last market crash far the best-performing group was consumer staples. But if the goal is to find non-cyclical companies with no exposure to Europe, investors who have bid up Wisconsin Energy or Pembina Pipeline have the right idea. And dividend-paying utilities will benefit if central banks respond to a European crisis by printing money, keeping discount rates low.Remember how little relative outperformance can mean when things get ugly, though: in real money utilities dropped 46 per cent in the last crisis. Unless you have a stock-only mandate, sector allocation during a collapsing market is like deciding whether to use the salad fork or the dinner fork to stab yourself in the eye. The right question may be: how much money belongs in stocks at all?Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
45;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2012-05-01T17:44:07Z;Commodities prices dent company profits;;High oil and commodities prices are starting to dent the profitability of the world’s largest industrial and consumer goods companies, with businesses from Procter & Gamble in the US to BASF in Europe warning of a strong headwind.As companies release their results for the first quarter, executives are warning that rising raw materials prices, particularly oil, are now a problem.Commodities prices “remain stubbornly high”, Jean-Marc Huët, chief financial officer at Unilever, the world’s second largest consumer goods company, said. Thomas Falk, chief executive of Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Huggies nappies, added: “Most oil-based costs are tracking a little higher than we expected.”Brent crude prices averaged $118.5 a barrel in the first quarter of the year, the second highest quarterly average, below only the March-June period of 2008. Oil rose above $120 a barrel on Tuesday after hitting a peak of $128 in March.The cost of oil, which feeds into petrochemicals and plastics, was up 10 per cent on average between January and March compared with the first quarter of a year ago on the back of supply disruptions and geopolitical fears about Iran.Morgan Stanley said that the oil spike of 2008 acted as a drag on equities only once oil rose above $120 a barrel. The bank said that traditionally consumer goods companies suffer the most during a surge in oil prices.Industrial and consumer goods companies have raised prices several times in the past year to counter rising oil and other commodities prices. But some said in conference calls with investors after releasing first-quarter results they were struggling to recover full cost increases due to weak economic growth and high un­employment in western countries.Kurt Bock, chief executive of BASF, the world’s biggest chemical maker by sales, told investors “increased raw material costs could not be fully passed on in all business areas, which put pressure on our margins”.Jon R. Moeller, chief financial officer at Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest consumer goods company, added that “higher commodity cost” was one of the reasons for lower-than-expected profits even as the company was raising prices.The impact of commodities was uneven, nonetheless, with some companies benefiting from lower prices on a few raw materials. The cost of aluminium fell in the first quarter compared with the same period of 2011, helping the food and drinks industry, which uses the metal for packaging and cans.Pulp prices, which have fallen by about 15 per cent since the middle of last year, also cut packaging costs in food and other sectors. US-based petrochemical companies benefited as the cost of natural gas, a key feedstock, hit a 10-year low.
46;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2012-04-20T21:57:04Z;US Inc: thank goodness for EMs;;Half way into first quarter earnings season in the US and one trend is already becoming apparent – the extent to which US Inc is being propped up by emerging markets.Kimberly-Clark, maker of Huggies diapers (nappies) and Kleenex tissues, on Friday became the latest US corporate to sing the praises of EMs – where strong sales growth has helped the consumer goods company offset weaknesses in its core US market.“Emerging markets were super strong this quarter,” Tom Falk, chief executive said in an interview on CNBC.For the three months to March 31, net sales rose 4.2 per cent to $5.25bn, compared to $5.03bn the same period the year before. Net income jumped by more than a third to $468m, or $1.18 a share, compared to $350m, or $0.86 a share in Q1 last year.The better-than-expected results – which analysts at Barclays described as “one of the strongest sets of quarterly numbers we can recall seeing” – mask the diverging fortunes between Kimberly Clark’s businesses in North America and emerging markets.Sales volume in North America fell in both its personal care and tissue businesses as belt-tightening consumers traded down to cheaper brands of diapers and toilet-training pants, while a weak cold-and-flu season hit sales of Kleenex. (The group still managed to eek out revenue increases in the businesses in North America thanks to price increases).Still, the performance in North America contrasted sharply with that of K-C International, the group’s emerging markets division which groups together Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa. Sales volumes of personal care products were up 12 per cent with double-digit growth in each major region.China led the way, with a 45 per cent rise in sales thanks to soaring sales of disposable diapers in the country. Meanwhile, sales in Russia and Latin America grew around 25 per cent each.It is not the only US company whose sales gains are coming from emerging markets.General Electric, which on Friday reported record order bookings in the first quarter, said some of the large orders came from emerging economies including South Africa and Kenya. The company, one of America’s leading industrial conglomerates and the world’s biggest maker of jet engines and electric turbines, is banking on its investments in emerging markets to offset the slowdown in Europe.It seems to be on the right track. Revenues from China and sub-Saharan Africa were both up 18 per cent while revenues from Latin America and Russia were up 35 per cent and 100 per cent respectively.Emerging markets also remain a bright spot for Honeywell, the aerospace and controls group. The company, which reported a 21 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings per share, said China is expected to account for a growing share of its aerospace business.Elsewhere, Yum! Brands, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola – which all derive a significant portion of their earnings from emerging markets – reported solid Q1 results this week thanks to outperformance in China and other EMs.So for all the talks about softer-than-expected China growth data and Brazil’s chicken flight growth, it looks like the 8.1 per cent GDP growth reported by China for Q1 and the 5 per cent plus growth EMs are expecting in 2012 is giving plenty for US Inc to be happy about.
47;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2012-04-20T13:21:48Z;Kimberly-Clark cost cuts lead to profit rise;;Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues, posted a sharp rise in quarterly profits thanks to big cost cuts and a modest increase in sales.Net profit at the consumer goods group climbed 31 per cent to $487m in the three months to March 31, beating Wall Street expectations and lifting its shares nearly 1.6 per cent to $76.47.Sales increased 4 per cent to $5.2bn, reflecting a combination of higher volumes and higher prices as the company continues to pass on higher materials costs to consumers.Lauren Lieberman, analyst at Barclays Capital, said: “It has been a long time since we’ve seen a company post better than expected volumes and stronger pricing …[We] can only hope others in the industry will have seen similar dynamics.”Its adjusted gross margin rose 2.5 percentage points partly due to $60m in cost savings.The company repeated its guidance for its full-year earnings, noting that while pulp costs were likely to be lower than expected the effect was being offset by rising oil prices.While cutting more costs, Thomas Falk, chief executive, said: “We will continue to increase strategic marketing faster than sales and pursue our targeted growth initiatives, with a special focus on K-C International.”
48;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2012-01-24T21:18:07Z;Wall Street hampered by soft earnings;Doubt from Europe drags markets;An earnings miss by Zions Bancorporation highlighted the ongoing risk to US banks from souring loan securities.Utah-based Zions, which owns a group of banks in southern and western states, fell 7.6 per cent to $17.15 as it booked a $12.1m, or four cents a share, charge on collateralised debt obligation securities in the fourth quarter.Overall per share earnings of 24 cents were 9 cents lower than expected.Zions followed the trend in fourth-quarter bank results, reporting a fall in non-performing assets over the fourth quarter and reducing reserves set aside for losses from loans made by the bank itself.But Zions recognised losses on securities the bank holds from CDOs, instruments which issue securities backed by the debt of low-rated companies.$4.3m of the CDO losses resulted from the bankruptcy of a homebuilder, while Zions also said its CDO portfolio “had exposure to 24 of the 92 bank failures that occurred in 2011”.The CDO charge was four times greater than expected by Stifel Nicolaus analysts, who removed their “buy” recommendation on the stock, although Brian Zabora at Stifel, said no other bank he covered had a portfolio of CDO securities, “so this issue should be pretty unique to Zion”.Zion’s report added to a gloomy start to earnings season by financials, which are so far showing year-on-year earnings growth of 10.4 per cent, well short of consensus analyst expectations of 20.7 per cent at the start of the season“With financial sector heavyweights generally …dragging down early fourth-quarter results, the rest of the S&P 500 will have work to do to drag index earnings back toward expectations in the weeks ahead,” said Gina Martin Adams, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo.The S&P 500 snapped a 5-day rally to close down 0.1 per cent at 1,314.63. The benchmark US index had opened sharply lower after Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, said it would likely declare Greece in “selective default” once the country concludes its debt restructuring, but the index pared losses on positive US economic data.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 12,675.75 but the Nasdaq Composite index ticked up 0.1 per cent to 2,786.64Stocks were further boosted after the close of trading, when Apple reported record fiscal first-quarter profits and revenues, easily surpassing analyst expectations as iPhone sales surged. That sent Nasdaq futures up 24½ points in after-hours trading.Apple rose as much as 12 per cent to $468 in after-hours after it closed in regular trading at $420.41, down 1.6 per cent.Tech stocks had already outperformed after fourth-quarter sales at Western Digital, the hard disc drive manufacturer came in significantly above expectations, given the disruption to the company’s supply chain caused by flooding in Thailand. Shares rose 6.3 per cent to $36.88.“Our thesis that WD can systematically recover and gain share is playing out much faster than anticipated with much higher profit,” Ben Reitzes at Barclays Capital told clients.That helped semiconductor manufacturers, which build components for hard disc drives, and the Philadelphia Sox index of semiconductor stocks climbed 0.4 per cent.Data storage computer manufacturer EMC Corp climbed 7.3 per cent to $25.14 as fourth-quarter earnings rose almost a third year-on-year. Disruption to Western Digital’s supply chain had left EMC facing higher prices for hard disc drives, “but the company has done a great job of getting its allocation of disc drives without suffering too much margin degradation,” said Jason Noland at RW Baird.Nasdaq futures accelerated further in after-hours trading, after Apple reported fourth-quarter earnings that were 30 per cent above consensus expectations, and also offered strong guidance for the current quarter.Verizon Communications fell 1.6 per cent to $37.79 after reporting an overall net loss of $2.02bn, hampered by pension costs and lower margins on smartphone sales.Investors continued to express doubts in the new management team at Research In Motion, sending shares in the BlackBerry handset manufacturer down 3.5 per cent to 15.01, barely 50 cents higher than they started the year.Investment bank Jefferies said RIM is at a “cost disadvantage” compared with other smartphone producers and that significant restructuring will be necessary to compete in the future.McDonald’s reported strong fourth-quarter earnings with net income rising 11 per cent from a year ago but share sold off 2.2 per cent to $98.75.Insurance group Travelers narrowly missed analyst estimates, logging $618m of net income in the fourth quarter compared with forecasts of $620m but its shares fell 3.8 per cent to $58.00 for the worst performance in the Dow Jones.Kimberly-Clark also succumbed to disappointment surrounding its fourth-quarter earnings. The maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies reported that net income fell 19 per cent from a year ago and that it expected a “difficult” start to 2012. Its shares were off 1.7 per cent to $72.27.Coach climbed 5.8 per cent to $67.97 as the luxury retailer defied the gloom cast by Tiffany, which earlier this year reported a year-on-year fall in holiday sales at its flagship New York store. Same-store sales at Coach’s North American stores were up 8.8 per cent.Peabody Energy, the largest US coal producer, fell 1.7 per cent to $36.86 after fourth-quarter earnings missed analyst estimates because of lower output at its Australian operations.
49;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Kimberly-Clark warns of ‘difficult’ 2012;;Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, reported a drop in fourth-quarter profit that was worse than expected and forecast a “difficult” start to 2012 amid economic weakness in the US and Europe.The consumer goods group said its net income fell 19 per cent from a year ago to $422m, or $1.01 a share, in the three months to December 31 even as its net sales edged up 2 per cent to $5.2bn, in line with Wall Street expectations.Thomas Falk, chief executive, said: “Looking ahead to 2012, we expect economic conditions to remain difficult in the near term, particularly in developed markets.”Kimberly-Clark shares fell 1.7 per cent to $72.27 in New York in a flat market.In North America the group’s organic sales fell 5 per cent in the fourth quarter and Mr Falk said of 2012: “While we are cautiously optimistic that portions of the US economy are improving, we aren’t planning for a big increase in market demand.”In crisis-hit Europe, he said “economic growth and the pricing environment in Europe [are] going to be tough”.The fall in fourth-quarter profit was due partly to the cost of several plant closures and sales, which the company had already announced, and higher materials costs, which consumer goods groups have been battling for several quarters.But Kimberly-Clark said that in 2012 commodity costs would be “more benign” while foreign exchange moves would be a negative “headwind”.Emerging markets led by Latin America and Asia - notably China, South Korea and Vietnam - continued to be strong, with organic sales in the group’s international business rising by 7 per cent in the past quarter.Mark Buthman, Kimberly-Clark’s chief financial officer, said that regions outside the US and Europe now contributed 36 per cent of the group’s revenues, up from 20 per cent in 2004.The company forecast that global sales this year would be flat at worst and grow by 1 per cent at best. It said its adjusted earnings per share – which exclude the costs of already announced restructuring – would be up 4 to 7 per cent at $5.00 to $5.15.
50;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2012-01-20T15:51:49Z;Walmart appoints most senior female employee;;Walmart has appointed Rosalind Brewer as the new head of Sam’s Club, its warehouse club business, making her the most senior female employee in the company’s history.The world’s biggest retailer by sales announced on Friday that Brian Cornell was stepping down as the head of Sam’s Club, one of the three most senior positions in the company below the chief executive. Sam’s Club has annual sales of $53bn.Walmart has been dogged by allegations of discrimination against female employees as it has grown to dominate the US retail market, claims that it has consistently rejected.Sam’s Club is the US’s second biggest warehouse club by sales and has posted consistent revenue growth under Mr Cornell at a time when sales at Walmart’s eponymous US stores have been flat.Ms Brewer, who will take up the new post on February 1, joined Walmart more than five years ago from Kimberly-Clark, the consumer goods maker.Mike Duke, Walmart’s chief executive, said that since then: “I have seen her develop into a talented merchant and retailer. She has strong strategic, analytical and operational skills and has successfully managed a large and complex business.”Mr Cornell said he was stepping down to move back to the northeast US so he and his wife could “live in the same ZIP code as our children”. Mr Duke said the outgoing Sam’s Club boss “has done a terrific job”.Sam’s Club attracts higher-income customers than Walmart stores. They pay a membership fee to buy in bulk food and other products stacked on towering shelves in industrial-style outlets.Walmart also announced the promotions of two other women on Friday. Gisel Ruiz will become executive vice-president and chief operating officer for Walmart US and Karenann Terrell will become chief information officer.Last June, the US Supreme Court ruled that a giant sex discrimination case against Walmart could not proceed.In the class action, six plaintiffs accused Walmart of paying women less than men and of passing them over for promotion, but the court ruled that they could not represent all current and former female employees as they had sought to do so.The plaintiffs have vowed to pursue the case through a different legal route.
51;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2011-11-12T02:04:48Z;Fiberweb to sell hygiene arm stake for £179m;;Fiberweb, the UK-based supplier of non-woven textiles, will receive £179m($288m) for the majority of its hygiene division, becoming net cash positive for the first time since the company demerged from BBA Aviation five years ago.The company said it had reached an agreement with Petropar, its Brazilian partner, to sell its 50 per cent stake in Fitessa Fiberweb, a joint venture with assets in Brazil, Mexico and North America, for £163m in cash and a £16m loan redeemable at the end of next year.If the deal goes through, Fiberweb would end up with £5m-£10m of net cash, depending on foreign exchange fluctuations. At the end of October it had £145m of net debt.Daniel Dayan, chief executive, highlighted the pressure he had been under from shareholders to shed Fiberweb’s large debt load, inherited after its spin-off from BBA Aviation five years ago. At the time of its spin-off, total debt was £175m.“Shareholders had always been worried about our gearing and we are dealing with this issue once and for all …The acquisition gives us an opportunity to end up with a very strong balance sheet,” Mr Dayan said.Fiberweb’s shares closed up 24 per cent at 50¼p.Its hygiene division, which supplies fabric to Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, brought in £12m of earnings before tax and £193m in sales last year, accounting for 42 per cent of the company’s total sales. The enterprise value of the assets being sold is £225m, taking into account net debt from Fitessa Fiberweb, which Petropar will take on wholly.
52;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2011-10-30T18:46:13Z;US groups fear effects of a stronger dollar;;The risk of a stronger dollar is becoming as big a concern as commodity inflation for US consumer goods companies ranging from the maker of Huggies nappies to PepsiCo.Thomas Falk, chief executive of Kimberly-Clark, which makes Huggies and Kleenex tissues, told analysts last week that currency moves were likely to dent the company’s earnings this quarter just as the negative impact of higher material costs was beginning to abate.“Commodity costs will be a little bit better [in the] fourth quarter versus [the] third quarter – still higher than last year, but [they] should be sequentially better,” he said. “Currency will be a drag. And so that’ll partially offset [slowing cost inflation].”US consumer goods makers have suffered from a two-year rally in commodity prices that has steadily eroded their profit margins, but they benefited from a parallel weakening of the dollar, which raised the value of their foreign earnings in their home currency.Although Kimberly-Clark and its biggest rivals in household and personal products – Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive – all said higher input costs had eaten into their profits in the third quarter, the market trends behind the problem have been shifting.The dollar strengthened by 5.7 per cent on a trade-weighted basis in the three months to the end of September, while the IMF Commodity Index fell back by 4.6 per cent.Jon Moeller, P&G’s chief financial officer, said last week: “Typically when we see a commodity help, we …have a currency hurt. Typically when we see a commodity hurt, we …have a currency help.”He said currency trends were a “negative development” for P&G, which makes Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors, but that the group would continue to face “very difficult commodity cost comparisons” in the current quarter.Commodity prices have eased in recent months amid signs of slowing global growth and concerns about the effect of the eurozone debt crisis. Some, such as iron ore, have fallen more than 30 per cent. However, the prices of many commodities that are crucial for consumer goods companies, such as crude oil and grains, remain stubbornly high.All consumer companies have sought to mitigate the impact of higher materials costs by passing some of them on to consumers through raised prices.Steve Powers, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said a retreat in commodities would not necessarily provide relief for consumers. Instead companies such as Coca-Cola would need to continue raising prices because they would lose the currency tailwinds that had been helping them absorb cost increases.Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo’s chief financial officer, said earlier this month that due to a stronger US dollar the company now expected currency effects to add 1 percentage point rather than 2 percentage points to its earnings growth in its current fiscal year.Since the start of October the dollar has weakened again by 4.4 per cent, but some analysts say it could strengthen if the US economy picks up.Across the consumer sector, foreign exchange effects will cut 2 to 3 percentage points off earnings over the next 12 months, according to analysts at Sanford Bernstein.

54;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2011-09-10T00:42:03Z;Demand forecasting pays off for Kimberly-Clark;Interview: Greg Schroeder, senior manager;Over the past four years, Kimberly-Clark, the US-based personal and healthcare products group, has made a conscious decision to shift from operating a traditional supply chain to what it describes as a ‘value chain’ encompassing consumers, its retail supply chain and supply chain partners.The company, whose leading brands include Kleenex, Scott and Huggies, says this has required focusing on the information flows that link demand at the consumer level with supply capability, removing any complexities that may impede the ability to respond.So what have the results of this shift been? The company’s consumer products business has reduced the number of plants it operates from 19 to 15 and warehouses from 80 to 25. Two initiatives – vendor-managed inventory and plant-direct shipments – have played a big role in this strategy and now account for 30 per cent and 35 per cent respectively of all volume reaching the customer. In the process, Kimberly-Clark has reduced its cash conversion cycle by 20 days and cut its total supply chain expense and increased gross margins.I asked Greg Schroeder, Kimberly-Clark’s senior manager for the company’s supply chain centre of excellence, to tell me about the project and its achievements. Below is an edited transcript of our conversation.Q. Greg, tell me exactly what your job involves and how this process began?A. My responsibility spans all of the strategy work and the new capability we have built into what we call the ‘Advanced Capability Team’ with a focus on supply chain connections, all the way from dirt to shelf.Since 2007 Kimberly-Clark has been on journey moving from the traditional supply chain orientation that was very much manufacturing-focused, to a supplier focus. We augmented that initiative with a demand-driven strategy change that was very consistent with what a lot of other manufacturers in the environment were doing.One of the big things we recognised at the time was that starting with Walmart and expanding out to several other major retailers, we were beginning to see an explosion in point-of-sale data and information about customer activities. We knew we had to do a better job of understanding and interpreting all the information we were getting from the field.Q. How did you go about sifting though this data and making sense of it?A. We engaged with Terra Technology [a specialist supply chain technology company focused on improving demand forecasting for consumer product manufacturing companies] as a first step. We have now reached the point where we are consistently using point of sale and other customer data all the way back into Kimberly-Clark’s manufacturing facilities on a daily basis. We are using that data not only to determine what we ship to our distribution centres, but also to provide a direct connection all the way back to our supply base – all the way back to the (paper) pulp.Q. Can you give me an example of how this works?A. Well, for example, I am sure that after the recent hurricane [on the US east coast] that every consumer products company that supplies North American retailers really struggled to understand what happened as a result of it.Our forecast, like everyone else, was terrible throughout that week because no one could predict [the storm’s] consequences. But where we differ now from others is that this technology provides us with an ability to understand every day what retailers and customers were doing as they began to get back to some sense of normalcy.We were able to see consumers going back to the stores to start buying their diapers and their Kleenex and we could tell when the Walmarts of the world and the BJ’s Wholesale clubs in the northeast started to restock commodity items, or whether they were still focused on things like generators and clean up supplies.Similarly, around Christmas time we always really struggle because the GI Joe’s and the Barbie dolls get all the priority for handling and stock movement during that time of the year.As a result of our ability to tap into this point-of-sale activity, we are now in a position to answer questions like, ‘What is the recovery at the retailer level?’ or ‘How are consumers reacting?’ and then make sure that we have got stock in position to support that.Q. So what were you able to do in the wake of the hurricane as a result of having the system that you couldn’t do before?A. In the past, we would release and rely on a primarily history-driven forecast, so for example, if we sold 1,000 last week, we are probably going to sell 1,000 this week. We would use this weekly historical approach to adjust our base forecast and use it to determine where we were going to place stock. When orders came in, we used those to adjust our forecast.What is different now is that because we have access to point-of-sale data and can see the demand that our retailers are facing, we are able to better predict what those orders are going to look like.As a result, our need to ship product from the west coast to the east coast at the last minute on a rush truck as opposed to rail because we anticipated demand wrongly is reduced. We have seen a significant reduction in rush shipment activity. We have been able to better handle variables and generally have stock in the right place to meet variables, because we have reduced the incidence of inaccurate forecasts.Q. When did you actually implement this demand forecasting system?We really took a two-phase approach. First we started to look at our customer order patterns, then about six months later, we reached out further, grabbing point-of-sale data from select retailers and other data such as stock from distribution centres to their stores.Q. And in terms of data points, how much data are we talking about?A. I’m not sure about the total, but it’s an exhaustive amount of data. I know at one point in time we had in the neighbourhood of 80,000 SKU/location combinations across our total North American network. If you expand that to the number of point-of-sale opportunities that exist and the retailer locations that exist the numbers are staggering.Q. The consumer products group has reduced its warehouses and plants very significantly. Was this as a result of your demand sensing project?A. Exactly, right. If you step back, we developed a set of initiatives that are linked together. The Terra Technology project and the forecast visibility and responsiveness it enabled links to our distribution strategies that have ultimately enabled us to reduce our distribution centres to more select facilities. That is also linked to efforts to tie our manufacturing strategies with our lean implementation.They are all very interconnected and that is really the value of the journey and the value of the demand sensing strategy. If we were to just implement a forecast improvement programme by itself, it would really deliver no inherent value.Q How quickly can you tweak something like manufacturing production based on the information you are getting back in the marketplace? Is this something that you can do on a daily basis now?A. Well one of the areas that we’re really aggressively going after now is how do we improve the connections from the retailer all the way back into our distribution and manufacturing.We have certain supply chains where we have really been focusing on lead time reductions, where if we have a demand response that we see happening in the marketplace today, we will tomorrow be in a position where we will have trucks redeployed to go to a specific area and then on the subsequent day we will be advising on production changes that could be enacted within seven days.We have some supply chains that turn around on a seven-to-ten day basis. Some of them we’re still working to reduce, but we’re using segmentation strategies to be selective in determining where should we have that type of responsiveness, and where is it okay if we are still at a two or three week lead time.Q. So where would you say Kimberly-Clark is in this process? Are you in the middle of a journey rather than at the end of it?A. I am not sure you ever get to the end of it. We do not anticipate that the retail environment will become any less dynamic, so we have to continue to stay on top of our responsive strategies to stay competitive.

He added: “The board also believes Mr Icahn’s revised proposal lacks detail and contains significant conditionality.”After Clorox rejected Mr Icahn’s initial bid last week, the activist investor raised his offer on Friday.In a new letter to Mr Icahn, Don Knauss, Clorox’s chief executive, wrote: “Our board believes that a credible proposal must deliver compelling value and certainty, and includes, among other things, a fully underwritten debt commitment and clearly identified and adequate equity capital that in the aggregate would be sufficient to complete a transaction.”Mr Icahn already owns 9.4 per cent of Clorox and presented his bids as a means of flushing out potential corporate buyers for Clorox. Several analysts have said he is unlikely to succeed.This week Kimberly-Clark, which was named by Mr Icahn as a potential buyer, ruled out making a bid.

Nine of the S&P’s 10 major sectors declined, the softest being telecoms services, down 1.4 per cent, and healthcare, down 1.1 per cent. Utilities, a defensive sector, rose 0.3 per cent.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 2,842.80, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,592.80.Investors are waiting to see whether Congress can dissolve partisan deadlock and raise the $14,300bn debt ceiling and avoid potential default before the August 2 deadline imposed by the Treasury.Republicans and Democrats announced rival plans to increase the US borrowing cap.John Boehner, the senior Republican in the House of Representatives, proposed raising the ceiling in two steps.Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, announced a separate measure to raise the debt limit by $2,400bn in a single move.Anthony Conroy, managing director at Convergex, said: “When Congress fails to agree, it’s certainly not viewed as positive. Any uncertainty is creating volatility, and we’re witnessing that volatility today.”The Vix index, a measure of equity volatility, rose 11 per cent on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. “It still appears very unlikely that the US will actually default, since the political cost of being seen as the group which triggered one could be very high,” said David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds.“If there is a deal, even if it limits the growth in Treasury issuance over the next few years, it could remove the roadblock of budget uncertainty from both the economy and markets, an eventuality that should prove stock-positive and bond negative,” he added.The second-quarter earnings season was being overshadowed by the debt ceiling impasse.“We don’t have much in terms of economic news, so the focus is on what is not happening with getting the debt ceiling lifted,” said Marc Pado, US markets strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “I think there’s still juice in this market if they get a deal done.”Lorillard, the maker of Newport and other cigarette brands, fell 4.5 per cent to $107.29 despite reporting quarterly net profit that beat expectations. Analysts speculated that the shares were hit by investors taking profits since the stock had gained 37 per cent this year.Shares in Kimberly-Clarkfell 2.1 per cent to $66.48 after earnings dropped 1.8 per cent as higher costs weighed on the manufacturer of Kleenex tissues. The company also warned that its 2011 earnings could arrive near the lower end of its forecast.Eaton, a US manufacturer, gained 2.8 per cent to $52.59 after beating profit estimates, citing fresh demand for electrical systems and a strengthening truck market.Baker Hughes, the oilfield services company, reported second-quarter profits that beat forecasts.“The structural improvement in the underlying operations at [Baker Hughes] is no longer a secret to investors, but we expect that [second-quarter] results should help solidify recent improvement in investor sentiment towards the name,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.The stock rose 0.1 per cent to $79.94.A handful of downstream oil companies were also strong. Marathon Petroleum rose 2 per cent to $41.37 after investment bank Dahlman Rose rated the stock a buy.

57;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2011-07-25T17:11:59Z;Kimberly-Clark rules out Clorox bid;;Clorox, the US household products group being stalked by Carl Icahn, is unlikely to receive a rival offer from Kimberly-Clark after the company’s chief executive dismissed talk of a potential bid.Tom Falk, chief executive of Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, said: “Our plan … doesn’t call for big transformational M&A. And so I don’t think the announcements related to Clorox change that point of view.”Speaking as Kimberly-Clark presented its quarterly results, he added: “We would consider Clorox to be a well-managed company and so as we look at it, it’s hard to see how you come in and do a whole lot better job of it.”Kimberly-Clark was one of six companies named ten days ago by Mr Icahn, the activist investor, when he announced a bid for Clorox that valued the company at $12.6bn, including debt. He presented it openly as a means of flushing out other potential suitors.He already has a 9.4 per cent stake in Clorox.Mr Falk is the first chief executive to comment publicly on the Clorox deal. The other companies named by Mr Icahn were Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, Reckitt Benckiser and Henkel. Several analysts have expressed scepticism about any of them launching rival bids.Clorox rejected Mr Icahn’s initial offer last week and the activist investor raised his bid on Friday to a new price that values the group at $13bn including debt.Kimberly-Clark on Monday reported a sharp fall in net income and slim sales growth in the three months to the end of June.Net income fell 17.4 per cent to $432m from the same period last year due partly to the ongoing impact of high commodity costs.Sales increased 8 per cent to $5.3bn, but US sales growth was weak and when currency effects were excluded overall sales rose just 3 per cent.Kimberly-Clark shares were trading down 1.5 per cent at $66.88 at midday in New York.
58;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2011-07-19T01:42:38Z;Clorox rejects $12.6bn Icahn bid;;Clorox, the US household products maker, has rejected an unsolicited $12.6bn bid from Carl Icahn, the activist investor, who last week sought to spark a bidding war with his move.Don Knauss, chairman and chief executive of Clorox, told the Financial Times: “We’re not opposed to a sale, but we’d certainly be opposed to a steal.”Mr Icahn had offered to acquire Clorox for $76.50 a share, valuing the group at $12.6bn including debt. But he made clear in his bid letter that he wanted Clorox to seek a higher price from a corporate buyer and he floated $100 a share as plausible.Several analysts said they doubted that companies named by Mr Icahn as possible buyers, including Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, would want to own Clorox.Gary Michael, Clorox’s lead director, said on Monday: “Our board has unanimously determined Mr Icahn’s unsolicited proposal is neither credible nor adequate.”Clorox separately said that the board had voted to put in place a “shareholder rights plan”, often called a poison pill, designed to ward off unwanted takeover interest.Clorox – whose assortment of brands includes Pine Sol cleaning products and Scoop Away cat litter – stressed its record of producing shareholder returns higher than those of its peers over the past three years.Mr Knauss said the company had been gaining market share and saw further potential for its brands. “There is still more growth to go after in the US,” Mr Knauss said, adding that the company had focused on a number of key trends, including catering to ethnic minorities.Asked about the possibility of a bid emerging from a corporate rival, Mr Knauss said: “I can’t speculate on what they may or may not be thinking …But our plan is the best to deliver growth.”But Clorox did not rule out supporting any bid for the company: “The board regularly evaluates opportunities given the dynamic nature of the company’s industry and remains open to considering any credible plan to create significant stockholder value.”Several risk arbitrage investors, who invest around potential deal situations, said they were steering clear of investing in Clorox. One suggested that such investors were suffering from “Icahn fatigue”.Mr Icahn said he was seeking $7.8bn of funding from Jefferies.Financiers said the size and structure of the financing looked ambitious in current markets.Analysts at UBS said P&G and Colgate were unlikely to want to increase their exposure to a developed market such as the US, while Unilever recently chose to move out of the laundry and detergents business.Other potential buyers including Reckitt Benckiser, Kimberly-Clark and Henkel have other priorities and are also focused on emerging markets, while SC Johnson, a private company, could struggle with financing, they added.
59;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2011-07-18T10:02:31Z;Small fish struggle to make a splash in global pond;Start-ups need large companies to take a punt on their new ideas;Graham Hawkins and Mano Manoharan are owners of a small business with big ambitions.LFH Illuminating Brands, the company they co-founded in 1993, generates a decent profit on a £3.7m turnover, designing labels for a range of blue-chip clients – including Coca Cola, Carlsberg, Kimberly-Clark and Unilever.By their own admission, their margins are a little below the industry average of 12 per cent. But they have marked themselves out from the hundreds of other UK design agencies by investing in advanced print machinery that can show clients exactly how a finished design will look – by printing it onto metal and plastic rather than a sheet of paper.Now, Hawkins and Manoharan believe they have made a further technological breakthrough that could take their business into another league.Their idea, patented under the name Chapter 1, focuses on the inefficiencies of using dozens of different inks to print a single range of product labels.One label could use half a dozen inks, notes Hawkins, who comes across as the technical brains of LFH. Across a product range, this could amount to 50 different inks, he explains – forcing the printing firm to shut down its machinery for hours at a time in order to clean off one label’s ink before another one can be run off.Chapter 1 is a method of rationalising ink colours without losing the all important hues that a brand manager values. This means that an entire range of products can be run without the printing presses stopping once. “We are working at the cutting edge of the technology,” Hawkins says.Already, Chapter 1 has been adopted on a small scale by a few of LFH’s existing clients. Unilever, for example, has used it for its range of spreads and has saved about €3m, or 10 per cent of its annual printing costs, according to Hawkins and Manoharan.However, deals like this have only contributed about £500,000 to LFH’s top line so far – not much of a return, given that Hawkins and Manoharan have sunk £2m of LFH’s profits into developing Chapter 1 over the last decade.“We are upstarts,” says Manoharan, an accountant by training who has taken on the business development role. He now spends his time writing to the finance directors of target companies about Chapter 1, but seems frustrated that his efforts have provided so little payback.“We think we are technically savvy and we have the potential to disrupt the market, but we have yet to have a big breakthrough,” he says.There is pressure on the two owner-managers at LFH to achieve this breakthrough. Five years ago, they sold a 15 per cent stake in LFH to a private equity firm, which is now keen to realise its return.One of the reasons LFH has struggled to get its technology adopted is that potential customers require LFH to service operations across the world – which would require a further large capital injection into the business.“It is like walking through treacle,” says Manoharan, who has taken to writing to non-executive directors, as well as finance heads, to lobby for their support.However, in spite of finding several champions for Chapter 1 in companies such as Unilever, he is yet to get the board of a multinational businesses to back the product.Hawkins and Manoharan’s story highlights a key factor in attempts to build a more entrepreneurial culture, and one that is often forgotten: the need for large companies to take a punt on a new idea. For businesses like LFH, it can be as important as a ready supply of venture capital and talented workers.In the UK, there are precedents for large companies employing the ideas of much smaller businesses – and reaping the benefits.DunnHumby, a husband-and-wife data mining business started on the kitchen table by Edwina Dunn and Clive Humby, transformed the fortunes of Tesco with their insight into customer behaviour.By devising the Clubcard loyalty scheme, DunnHumby helped Tesco overtake arch rival Sainsbury’s to become the UK’s largest retailer – and made multimillionaires of its two founders.Tesco eventually bought DunnHumby, paying £48m for the final 10 per cent in January, having helped the business become a multinational operation in the process, analysing data from more than 350m people in 25 countries.But evidence suggests that, for every DunnHumby, there are 20 LFHs being told by large companies that their ideas are not workable or needed.At LFH, Hawkins says that the problem of achieving the scale to make Chapter 1 an industry changer could be overcome by licensing the technology. But this idea is yet to gain any traction.The pair have little chance of raising the necessary funding for expansion from the bank, which last year insisted that they repay their £100,000 overdraft facility. Now, the best hope may be that LFH is acquired by a client that can provide the necessary capital injection.Eight companies have expressed an interest in buying LFH for the Chapter 1 technology, but Hawkins and Manoharan say that some of these are rival printing firms seeking to acquire LFH simply to shut down Chapter 1, and neutralise a competitive threat to their businesses.“We are the little fish trying to do a big deal,” Manoharan says.
60;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2011-07-15T18:59:49Z;Icahn tries to spark bidding war for Clorox;;By Barney Jopson, Helen Thomas and Dan McCrum in New YorkCarl Icahn, the activist investor, has sought to ignite a bidding war for Clorox, a US household products maker in which he owns shares, by making an offer to buy the company that values it at $12.6bn, including debt.In a letter released on Friday, Mr Icahn offered to acquire the company for $76.50 a share, but he made clear that he wanted Clorox to seek a higher price from a corporate buyer.His Icahn Enterprises is Clorox’s largest shareholder, with a 9.4 per cent stake.Shares in Clorox – whose brands include Pine Sol cleaning products, Scoop Away cat litter and Kingsford charcoal – were up 8.9 per cent at $74.55 by the close of trading on Friday in New York. The company said it “will review the proposal in due course”.Mr Icahn named other potential buyers as Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, Reckitt Benckiser, Kimberly-Clark and Henkel.But analysts at Weeden & Co said it was unlikely they would want the whole company. “Clorox’s portfolio is too US-centric, too fragmented, too exposed to commodities and commoditisation and it is financially well-managed as is,” they wrote in a note.The companies either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.In his letter, dated July 14, Mr Icahn told Donald Knauss, Clorox’s chief executive: “Now is the right time for Clorox to be aggressive in pursuing a strategic transaction.”He wrote: “While we stand ready and able to buy Clorox, we encourage you to hold an open and friendly ‘go-shop’ sale process where all the synergistic buyers are offered due diligence and invited to bid.”He continued: “If the company does so, we are confident the process will result in numerous superior bids for this company.”One manager of a multibillion-dollar hedge fund described the bold move as: “Classic Carl. Sometimes he wins, he loses.”Mr Icahn said he had secured $7.8bn of financing from Jefferies Group and would contribute $3.8bn of cash from Icahn Enterprises. The shares Icahn Enterprises currently owns account for the rest of the proposed deal’s value.The Jefferies financing would be on terms similar to that used in last year’s buy-out of Del Monte by a group led by KKR.But in spite of a Jefferies’ letter saying it is “highly confident” that it can arrange financing, some investors said it looked ambitious in current markets to raise debt worth seven times earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation at an interest rate of less than 6.5 per cent.Mr Icahn revealed his Clorox stake in February and people familiar with the matter said the company had had limited interaction with him since then.Clorox’s sales continued to grow during the economic downturn, but it has minimal presence in high-growth emerging markets and has been struggling to meet its latest revenue and profit targets in the face of high commodity costs and a weak US economy.Industry bankers said that most consumer goods companies are focused on increasing their exposure to faster-growing emerging markets, rather than adding US-centric brands.Clorox has streamlined its operations in the past year, selling its auto care business to Avista Capital Partners for about $780m.The business included STP, which makes oil treatments, brake fluids and fuel-system cleaners, as well as the Armor All brand of polishes, glass and upholstery cleaning products.
61;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2011-06-29T13:13:28Z;China’s nappy war: Mamy Poko v Pampers & Huggies;;"Procter & Gamble and Kimberly Clark have a problem in China and it goes by the name of Mamy Poko pants.The multinationals’ grip on the global nappy market – or diapers - is being challenged by Japan’s Unicharm group in the world’s most populous country and elsewhere in Asia.Unicharm’s Mamy Poko nappy pants are among the top three brands in the Chinese market along with Pampers of P&G and Huggies of Kimberly Clark, according to a survey of retailers from RCM, the fund management house. Some retailers say Mamy Poko has now overtaken Huggies in their stores to be the number two brand in sales.That matters. China might have a one-child policy but there are still a lot of baby bums to cover. Unicharm, which also products tampons and sanitary towels, lifted sales by 30 per cent in China in the year to March 31 to Y44.47bn ($550m). That helped offset flat sales growth in its home market.The survey by RCM, part of Allianz Global Investors, comes from the fund manager’s specialist Grassroots Research operation. Set up in 1984, Grassroots has produced research for internal consumption to help fund managers make investment decisions based on interviews with suppliers, retailers, distributors and sector experts about industry trends. It has carried out more 250,000 interviews since it was set up. RCM has now given the FT and beyondbrics access to some of the Grassroots Research reports.On the Chinese nappy market, RCM interviewed 25 retailers in China, five each in Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Nanjing and Shanghai. The research indicated another year of growth in the market.Johannes Jacobi, vice-president, European Grassroots, at RCM says:Sales of baby diapers increased an average 30 per cent in 2010 year-to-year, driven by improving living standards, greater diaper usage and a higher birth rate. A similar increase is expected in 2011 year-to-year.One retailer surveyed said:We are now in our third baby boom. The growing number of babies has driven up demand for corresponding products, including diapers. Also, young parents today have a high perception of diapers, which is different from the older generation. They use diapers for their baby from day to night. But five years ago, many used them only at night due to cost concerns.But perhaps the real story in the market is the growth of the Mamy Poko brand in China (and elsewhere in Asia) against the multinational competition on the back of some astute promotions and very cute marketing. The growth has come despite premium pricing.“In my store, the bestselling brands are Pampers, Huggies, Mamy Poko and Sealer (a product of Taiwan’s Everbeauty Corp). Pampers has been the bestseller for years due to high brand recognition, reasonable prices and reliable quality,” said one retailer.“Huggies and Mamy Poko are a bit more expensive vs. Pampers but are now introducing strong and attractive advertisements.

62;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2011-05-04T21:51:22Z;Energy leads further Wall Street retreat;;"US indices retreated further from multiyear highs achieved last week after disappointing economic data, softer commodity prices and a number of lacklustre earnings reports.The sharpest falls came from the energy sector, with National Oilwell Varco, the oilfield services company, falling 3.4 per cent to $69.92 and Cameron International losing 4.1 per cent to $48.70.ExxonMobil, the largest company in the world by market capitalisation, was down 0.9 per cent to $84.81 as the oil price fell back. The S&P energy index was off 1.6 per cent.“The fall in commodity prices should eventually be a good thing for the markets but in the meantime it is weighing heavily on the energy and material sectors,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.Energy stocks had led the rally in US equities over the past six months.Since the end of September, the S&P energy index has risen 49 per cent while the broader S&P 500 index is up 28.5 per cent.But this pattern has started to change in the past few weeks, with April the first month in almost a year where energy stocks did not outperform the benchmark S&P 500 index.The S&P energy index is down 1.2 per cent this month.Material stocks also lost ground in the session. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, fell 3.9 per cent to $51.14 while Cliff Natural Resources lost 4.1 per cent to $87.55. The S&P materials sector was down 1.7 per cent.These losses left the S&P 500 index down 0.7 per cent to 1,347.32 at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also 0.7 per cent softer at 12,723.12, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,828.23.Weak economic data weighed on sentiment across the wider markets, leaving all of the major S&P sectoral indices trading lower.The biggest disappointment was over the ISM non-manufacturing composite index, which plunged to 52.8 in April from 57.3 the previous month in a worrying sign of the rate of growth in the US services sector. However, a reading above 50 still indicates expansion.Separately, employment data from Automatic Data Processing estimated that the private sector had added 179,000 jobs in April, below the 200,000 economists had expected. The ADP data is significant as it is the first in a slew of crucial employment numbers to be released this week.The big event will be on Friday, when the official, monthly non-farm payroll numbers are set to be released, but before that there are the weekly numbers on Thursday.Some weak earnings results also kept market sentiment lower. Las Vegas Sands fell 7.4 per cent to $42.50 after the casino resort operator missed analysts’ earnings and revenue forecasts.Elsewhere, Kellogg, the cereal company, reported a 12 per cent drop in earnings and slimmer gross margins for the first quarter, sending its shares down 1.2 per cent to $56.78. Investors reacted negatively to the news as the maker of Rice Krispies and Pop-Tarts became the latest in a long line of companies to feel rising commodity costs.Last week, Procter & Gamble said it had underestimated commodity inflation in “a very difficult operating environment”.Kimberly-Clark and Nike have also reported weaker results this season thanks to higher commodity prices.In deal news, Applied Materials, the US semiconductor equipment maker, announced plans to buy rival Varian Semiconductor in a $4.9bn cash deal. The news sent shares in Varian up 51.3 per cent to $61.36, while Applied Materials lost 1 per cent to $15.09.Elsewhere, ConAgra Foods announced it had made a $4.9bn cash offer to acquireRalcorp, the cereal maker, in a deal that would make ConAgra the third-largest US packaged foods company by revenues.This sent shares in Ralcorp up 4.9 per cent to $87.39 while ConAgra Foods added 3.1 per cent to $25.51.Renren, China’s leading real-name social networking service, saw its shares surge 28.6 per cent to $18.01 on its trading debut in New York.The Beijing-based company, which is unlisted in China, had priced its initial public offering at $14 per share to raise $743m, at the top of its projected range
of $12-$14."
63;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2011-04-28T20:20:15Z;Shoppers in US squeezed by rising fuel costs;;American shoppers remain cash-strapped and may be even more reluctant to spend than last year, according to consumer goods companies which posted worse-than-expected quarterly sales figures for the US.Companies behind products from Ariel detergent to Colgate toothpaste have reported results that highlight the damaging impact of rising fuel prices on consumption.Even though stronger growth in emerging markets has offset the effects of weaker US sales at many companies, they are also seeing profit margins squeezed by higher commodity costs and are agonising over how much to pass on to consumers.The results came as US government figures revealed slowing growth in the first three months of the year and a deceleration in consumer spending growth from the end of last year.Procter & Gamble, the maker of Ariel and the world’s biggest consumer goods company, said on Thursday that its sales across developed markets grew less than 1 per cent from a year ago, falling short of the 1-2 per cent it had expected.Bob McDonald, chief executive, said: “The consumer in developed markets is struggling – struggling with higher gas prices, and relatively fixed to modestly higher incomes, which is causing them to make choices.”Colgate-Palmolive, a smaller P&G rival, said its sales in North America, which account for 18 per cent of its revenue, dropped 4.5 per cent in the past quarter.Kimberly-Clark said this week that sales in its US personal care division, which includes Huggies nappies, were down 2 per cent in the past quarter, while sales were flat in consumer tissues, which includes the Kleenex brand.P&G and PepsiCo on Thursday joined Coca-Cola in saying one of their responses to high commodity prices would be to shrink the size of some product packages while maintaining prices – a move that risks a backlash from consumers.On Monday P&G said it would raise the wholesale prices of other products, including a 7 per cent rise for Pampers nappies and a 5 per cent increase for Bounty paper towels.Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola’s chief executive, said this week that falling US unemployment had not yet had a positive impact on spending, and that the pain of rising petrol prices would become severe this summer.PepsiCo, the snacks and drinks group, said it would not raise prices by as much as it would have in other circumstances given the “challenging” environment consumers face. It posted improving sales in its snacks and drinks businesses, but higher costs ate into its profits, which fell by 20 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter.It also said it has noticed consumers spending more at small convenience and dollar stores as soaring petrol prices deter them from driving to bigger retailers.Mike Duke, chief executive of Walmart, the “big box” retailer, was asked if his customers were feeling the effects of a recovery and replied: “Not yet.”Noting a pattern of sales falling throughout the month and then surging as soon as consumers cash pay cheques, he said: “Even compared with a year ago, it shows more pressure on consumers.” Walmart reports its quarterly results next month.
64;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2011-04-25T20:50:28Z;Weaker earnings weigh on Wall Street;;Wall Street receded slightly from the strong gains seen last week after a string of disappointing earnings reports from companies such as Advanced Micro Devices, Kimberly-Clark and Johnson Controls.Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, released particularly lacklustre earnings, reporting a 9 per cent fall in first-quarter net income as higher raw material costs ate into its profitability.The company also revised up its estimate of input inflation for the rest of the year in response to the rising price of pulp, oil and resin. This worried investors, pushing the stock down 2.7 per cent to $64.24, amid wider unease over the effect of rising commodity costs on margins.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Advanced Micro Devices, one of the largest makers of processors for personal computers, reported that profits had more than doubled to $510m, or $0.68 per share, for the first quarter.But investors were a little disappointed by the news, and the stock lost 0.1 per cent to $8.70. This was largely because expectations for earnings in the tech sector were high after bumper earnings results from Intel, Apple, IBM and Qualcomm in the previous week. AMD added 5.3 per cent last week as sentiment jumped for such stocks.These results left the S&P 500 down 0.2 per cent to 1,335.26 at the close, paring some of the sharp gains on Wall Street in the previous week.Of the 124 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings so far, 80 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations compared with 73 per cent last quarter. Before the season started, analysts at Credit Suisse estimated that there would be a 65 per cent surprise rate overall.This week, 181 S&P companies will report their earnings, setting the tone for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to 12,479.88, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 2,825.88 in the session. The broadly negative sentiment was offset by the news that new family home sales rebounded 11.1 per cent to 300,000 in March from the previous month. This was higher than expected but “still miserable in absolute terms”, said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Volumes were very low as many markets around the world were closed for Easter Monday and investors were reluctant to place large trades ahead of the announcement on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve on US monetary policy.“People are waiting to see what is going to happen with the Fed, but my expectation is that there will not be much news,” said Timothy Holland, portfolio manager of the Aston/Tamro Diversified Equity Fund.“Core inflation has not moved dramatically, and employment and gross domestic product are still not that great, so the Fed will likely just continue to be supportive,” he said.In corporate news, Johnson Controls, a maker of battery systems for hybrid-electric vehicles, reported profit up 29 per cent in the first quarter as volume growth helped offset its higher costs. But investors were hoping for more and the stock was down 2.8 per cent to $39.60.RadioShack, the cons­umer-electronics chain, reported first-quarter earnings down 30 per cent and lowered its full-year earnings estimate by 10 cents a share. Earnings were affected by lower margins, weakness in its T-Mobile business and the expense of rolling out its branded wireless kiosks in Target stores. But the stock was still up 0.1 per cent to $15.85.Polycom, the maker of video conferencing equipment, said its first-quarter earnings had risen more than sixfold. Its shares were up 12.6 per cent to $58.43.In deal news, Barrick Gold, the world’s biggest gold producer, announced a C$7.3bn cash offer for Equinox Minerals, the Australian-Canadian copper miner. This sent shares in Barrick down 6.8 per cent to $51.86, while shares in Equinox Minerals added 10.5 per cent to $8.74. Equinox is already the target of a hostile offer by China’s Minmetals Resources. Barrick offered C$8.15 a share, compared with Minmetals’ C$7.NYSE Euronext said it was set to increase its forecast for cost savings by up to a third from a deal with Deutsche Börse, in a further effort to counter an $11.3bn bid from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange.Shares in NYSE were down 0.7 per cent to $38.76 while Nasdaq and ICE were down 1.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively, to $27.23 and $122.
65;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2011-04-25T20:32:55Z;‘Say-on-pay’ rules hit US executives;;US companies have begun cutting pay and benefits for top executives, and disclosing more details of packages, in anticipation of the effect of new rules that give shareholders greater power to vote down remuneration structures.According to pay consultancy ClearBridge, which has examined the first 100 Fortune 500 companies to file details of so-called proxy statements – resolutions to be voted on at annual meetings – there is clear evidence of a shift in pay practices.“Executive compensation tends to go up or stay flat, so any time it goes down is the beginning of a noteworthy trend,” said Russell Miller, partner at ClearBridge.The 2011 annual meeting season is the first to see the implementation of evidence of the effect of new “say-on-pay” rules, introduced as part of last year’s Dodd-Frank financial reforms.Nearly 40 companies, including AT&T, Walt Disney and OfficeMax, have eliminated tax breaks that have seen them take on executive tax bills under some circumstances.At the same time, General Electric has lengthened and toughened the terms of the share option plan for Jeff Immelt, its chief executive, responding to shareholder criticism ahead of Wednesday’s annual meeting.A portion of the $7.4m option award that would have vested in 2013 was pushed back to 2015, and the entire award only vests if the company meets performance targets.Companies are also reducing multiples of salary paid to chief executives as part of severance packages, and are adopting provisions to claw back bonus payments at a later date. Of the 79 companies disclosing clawbacks for executives, 34 adopted or enhanced these recently, according to ClearBridge.Disclosure of pay in proxy materials, the documents sent out to investors before annual meetings, has improved. “Companies have taken it upon themselves to think about what their story is,” said Robin Ferracone of Farient Advisors, a consultancy.GE put a summary of its pay programme at the start of its proxy statement.Several companies, including Kimberly-Clark and Lockheed Martin, have anticipated future requirements of say-on-pay rules by adding a comparison of total shareholder returns to chief executive pay.
66;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Kimberly-Clark signals price hikes;;Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, reported a fall in first-quarter earnings and doubled its estimate of raw material inflation for 2011 as high costs ate into its profitability.The US consumer goods group said it would raise prices to offset the cost of commodity inflation, which is squeezing its profit margins, but its executives were reluctant to predict how consumers would respond.Kimberly-Clark’s net income fell 9 per cent to $350m from $384m in the first three months of 2010 as higher commodity costs eclipsed the positive effect of a gain in sales, which rose 4 per cent to $5bn from $4.8bn.Investors will watch the results of its bigger rivals Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive on Thursday for signals on how they are coping with the same pressures.The group revised its estimate of inflation for key material inputs this year to between $450m and $550m from a previous range of $200m to $250m.It is most vulnerable to inflation in wood pulp and oil, whose prices have both risen by significantly more than the company anticipated.The company uses pulp for its range of tissue-based products and its exposure to oil stems from its reliance on oil-based resins and plastics for packaging.Tom Falk, its chairman and chief executive, said the company was operating in a “difficult environment”.Kimberly-Clark’s shares were down 3 per cent at $64.01 in early afternoon trading in New York.The operating margin of the company’s personal care business was compressed to 17.8 per cent from 22.1 per cent in the same quarter last year while the margin of its consumer tissues business fell to 9 per cent from 11.3 per cent. The company said it would raise prices on a variety of products, including most of its North American consumer goods, to offset higher commodity costs.Asked how consumers were likely to react, Mr Falk said: “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a customer yet who said ‘Thank you for that’ . . . It’s a competitive environment and we’ll see what happens in the marketplace.”Kimberly-Clark said it would also cut its overhead costs by more than previously planned. It said the benefits would become visible in the second half of the year.
67;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2011-03-15T16:22:30Z;Online advertising: It is hard to tell if the ads work;;As advertising dollars speed to the web, marketers are scrambling to find ways to measure the effectiveness of their search, display and social media efforts.While companies such as Nielsen and Omniture provide some ways of doing this, they give an incomplete picture of online behaviour.In addition to the “last click” (which records how a user came to a site, and if it was from an ad), the bigger question of how online advertising influences brand awareness is exceedingly hard to address.Measuring the effectiveness of online advertising is “very difficult,” says Tony Palmer, chief marketing officer of Kimberly-Clark, a consumer products group. Mr Palmer’s team has developed a strategy that is tailored to each product launch or new campaign.And yet, even years of internal development have not delivered an adequate solution. “We’re probably at 50 per cent of where we want to be in being able to measure our media mix,” he says. “It’s a competitive advantage to have better analytics.”In an effort to close this gap, new companies are emerging with the aim of providing more “holistic” measurement systems.MarketShare, which tries to measure how online spending works in concert with offline campaigns, has lured half the Fortune 50 as clients. Wes Nichols, its chief executive, says: “Rather than look at just who’s seeing something from outdoor, or online or in-store, we’re looking at how does it drive sales? How do they combine to create a reaction?”Mr Nichols cautions that it “is not as simple as looking at media mix”. Instead, he likens it to the human genome project. “It’s not like one gene causes cancer,” he says. “It’s a combination of factors.”For example, a consumer might see a Toyota ad on Yahoo, do a Google search for Toyota later and then go to Edmunds.com, the car guide, to look at ratings.“There are a lot of things that impacted what got that person to the dealership, but it’s usually the last click that gets all the credit,” says Mr Nichols.Another way that brands are working to get more out of online adverts is by rigorous experimentation and testing.“Kayak is a brand that lives online,” says Robert Birge, chief marketing officer of travel website Kayak.com. “Like many internet start-ups, we took an approach that was very online-focused.”Mr Birge says Kayak initially invested in paid search advertising, and relied on reputation and word-of-mouth. Recently, the company has invested in display adverts.But Mr Birge concedes that “online display is very complicated”, even for professionals. Kayak works with MediaMath, a company that provides advertising management services and technology, to buy search advertising.Equally important, is brand awareness.To hone this, Kayak runs experiments to test which adverts are most effective and how many clicks and sales different versions of adverts can generate.Some marketers think social media are an online arena that provides more clarity on what works.Nielsen has partnered with Facebook to track the effectiveness of adverts on the social network, and companies avidly count their Twitter followers, re-tweets, mentions, and “shares” on Facebook.Salesforce, the web-based customer management software provider, has embraced social media. “YouTube is transformational for us,” says Kendall Collins, chief marketing officer of Salesforce.“An event with our chief executive on stage is great, but a video is super-high fidelity, and the cost per video engagement can be very [low].”Mr Collins has sought to tie engagement in social media and the web to conversions into customers.“If you’re statistically minded and have the tools, you can correlate behaviour on your website with other behaviour,” he says.In 2007, Salesforce integrated its CRM system with the Google AdWords service. That allowed it to see quickly which keywords attract customers.But not all brands are rushing to social media.“[It] is a very hard nut to crack,” says Mr Birge. “The challenge is turning it into something that has a material impact on business. It’s hard to be a CMO and say social media aren’t your top priority.”In the absence of established metrics for online advertising, some marketers have created their own.Jim Farley, CMO of Ford, says his European team has developed a metric for the company: “cost per minute of engagement”.Encompassing the benefits of social engagement, the cost of producing content and the need to drive sales, Mr Farley says more companies may use this type of metric in years to come.“This is a highly relevant new metric in the world of social media,” he says.“If 6m people watch a minute-long video on YouTube, how does that compare with an advert on TV? The number of engagements, and the amount of time people spend with your content [can be much greater] online.”
68;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2010-12-27T19:33:49Z;Open innovation powers growth;;Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods company, is an acknowledged global industry leader in new consumer product innovation. According to data from IRI, the market research firm, it produced five of the top 10 US non-food product launches in 2009. But as it pursues its drive to add another 1bn customers to the estimated 4bn it already reaches, Bob McDonald, its chief executive, says that the road to more innovation should increasingly embrace other people’s good ideas.“We need bigger innovations that create more value,” Mr McDonald told this year’s annual gathering and awards event for companies and research institutions that work with P&G. “We want you to come to us with your big ideas first.”It is now commonplace for consumer goods companies to work with outside partners and to pursue “open innovation” (see panel). But P&G may be the one that has made the largest deliberate effort to expand its reach since the launch of its Connect & Develop programme in 2001 by A.G. Lafley, its then chief executive.In an attempt to open up the company and to end its resistance to innovations “not invented here”, Mr Lafley said he wanted at least 50 per cent of its new products to involve an outside partner. The company met that goal four years later and the share is now about 60 per cent.External co-operation has delivered a stream of successful “big idea” products. Last year’s IRI list included Tide Total Care, a premium version of its Tide detergent, which was number two by sales on IRI’s 2009 top 10 non-food products launch list. It was developed with external research from Sweden’s University of Lund and from two small chemical companies. P&G’s Always Infinity feminine care brand was at number eight – it uses a patented absorbent foam material from a manufacturing process developed with an external partner.P&G’s list of partners includes other large corporations, such as food groups ConAgra and General Mills, and rivals, including its Glad brand plastic bag joint venture with Clorox, set up in 2003. Its most unexpected government research partner may be the Los Alamos National Lab, the US defence technology research centre. Los Alamos initially helped P&G to regulate the production of the absorbent gel used in nappies, using theoretical data analysis systems developed for weapons technology.But part of P&G’s challenge is now learning how to work better with small and medium-sized companies, and entrepreneurs. “That to me is the largest barrier,” says Bruce Brown, P&G’s chief technology officer who also oversees about $2bn of spending on its internal R&D. “How do we really learn to work better with some of the small and medium-sized entrepreneurs?”Jeff Weedman, head of the Connect & Develop programme, says: “It’s normal for new partners to have a concern that they will be overwhelmed” and that “some small entrepreneurs don’t have the patience to work through” P&G’s exhaustive procedures.Even when the company begins to explore potential co-operation, it may still decide a proposed partnership does not work. “We most often say no thank you, even in proactive searches,” says Mr Weedman. “Fairly routinely . . . we’ll refer them on to other companies, up to and including competitors. We never want them to have an excuse to not call us first.”Mr McDonald has now called for the value of the Connect & Develop programme’s contribution to annual sales growth to triple by 2015, so that products launched with outsiders account for $3bn of annual sales growth, up from $1bn now. At current growth rates, the target would raise the share of new annual sales growth from the initiative from about 25 per cent to more than 60 per cent.Mr Brown says the target marks a second stage in the programme’s development, after a first stage that managed to create the cultural change sought, but risked becoming a “tick the box issue”.“Instead of just focusing on the number [of external partnerships], let’s focus on the value we can create,” he says.“When we get those really, really big ideas, we want to scale them more quickly across the company and use them in more places across the company.”Shekhar Mitra, head of research and development for P&G’s global beauty and grooming business, recalls that a decade ago P&G was not even regularly scanning related research work.“When we started to change our culture, we found out ‘Holy cow! There’s a world of minds out there that can bring innovation to us’,” he says.He was involved in one of the programme’s early success stories, the creation of its Olay Regenerist anti-ageing creams, which was built around molecular peptides developed by Sederma, a French company, part of the Croda group.“As a small company, we had little chance of getting in there until P&G switched its policy,” says Karl Lintner, who headed Sederma at the time.Sederma has worked with many of P&G’s global rivals too, and says that potential partners with large corporations need to realise that “sometimes – like with most bigger companies – things take longer than you think, so it’s a bit frustrating”.The Olay brand is also involved in one of the company’s latest product launches, in partnership with Syneron, an Israeli technology company, that has developed a patented anti-wrinkle beauty salon treatment called ReFirme. After four years of joint development with Syneron, P&G’s business in Canada has started selling its Olay Professional ReFirme treatment for C$250 (US$248).P&G is also seeking approval for the product in both the US and the UK, a demonstration of what Mr Weedman says is its ability to deliver the kind of rapid growth and scale that would have taken a smaller company years or decades to attain on its own.“When we decide we are going to take something global, we have the wherewithal,” he says. “If you get through working with P&G and it makes sense, when we go global, you will go global. And it will be very quick.”

His experience in Latin America as well as the global biopharmaceutical business is expected to be an asset for Pfizer as it looks to emerging markets, especially China for growth.After studying chemical engineering at Imperial College London, Mr Read, also a qualified accountant, joined Pfizer in 1978 as an auditor. After working in Mexico and Brazil, he became Europe head in 2000, taking on a global biopharma role in 2006. He also sits on the board of US tissue maker Kimberly-Clark.people@ft.com
70;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2010-12-07T18:17:56Z;US gas export plan sparks price fears;Consumers argue domestic prices will rise to global levels;An outcry from big US energy users is complicating plans to export some of the country’s bounty of natural gas.Two consumer groups said they were worried that proposals to liquefy for export as much as 3.4bn cu ft per day of domestic gas would drive up prices. Monday is the deadline for public comment on a project to export gas from Louisiana state.The proposals by Texas-based Cheniere Energy, and another to be co-developed by Macquarie, the Australian bank, come as new methods of exploiting underground shales have boosted proven US gas reserves to the highest level since 1971.The bonanza has pushed gas to $4.50 per m British thermal units, down 19 per cent in the past two years, spurring developers to export it to China and other higher-priced Asian markets.The proposals are consistent with a White House goal of doubling US exports, but could get tripped up by a law that lets the energy department block gas shipments to countries that do not have free trade pacts with the US if they are shown to harm the public interest.The department has said its main focus in reviewing export applications is domestic gas needs and energy security.The Industrial Energy Consumers of America, with members including Goodyear, International Paper, Kimberly-Clark and US Steel, said it was likely to file an objection to the Cheniere plan.“Exporting natural gas means that in time, US natural gas prices will rise to global price levels. The implication is serious because when the likes of China is in the market to buy, US buyers and consumers will have to compete with them for that natural gas,” said Paul Cicio, IECA president.The American Public Gas Association, which represents municipal gas utilities serving 5m customers, said gas might be cheap now but the situation could change. “At this point our supply picture is very positive, but we are not that far removed from $13 gas,” the APGA said. Gas last traded above $13 per m Btu in 2008.Cheniere, which has already won approval to export to countries with US free trade agreements, wants to build plants at Sabine Pass, Louisiana, to condense for export as much as 2bn cu ft per day.Its application acknowledges the project could increase domestic prices by between 4 and 11 per cent in 2015, but cites offsetting benefits such as creating jobs and cutting the US trade deficit. “We feel it’s good for America in general,” Cheniere said.Macquarie and partner Freeport LNG said independent studies showed that “the impact of our project on natural gas prices is negligible”.
71;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2010-10-28T20:54:45Z;US stocks pare losses in late trade;;The industrial sector retreated after 3M said its recent acquisition spree would reduce earnings this year, in an otherwise choppy trading day.The S&P 500 industrials index slipped 0.4 per cent, dragged down by the conglomerate that makes everything from Post-it notes to medical products.3M slumped 6.5 per cent to $84.52 after it said it expected full-year profit to be at the lower end of its previous guidance because of the two security services companies it bought at the end of August.But it posted solid third-quarter results as strong demand from the consumer electronics industry and rising sales in its Asia-Pacific division boosted profit.There was a mixed reception to other companies reporting their earnings, with some stocks falling in spite of positive reports.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,183.67, after fluctuating between positive and negative territory all day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.2 per cent to close at 11,009.71 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,507.37.“I think there’s a lot of hesitation in the markets,” said Jeff Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James.“They had a big move off the late-June low and I was bullish then and I’ve been bullish since.“But last week I turned a bit more cautious. We’re due for some kind of pause and/or pullback. Not much more than 5 to 8 per cent and then I think we’ll go up.”Strong earnings from ExxonMobil, the largest company by market capitalisation, failed to boost the energy sector, which closed down a fraction.ExxonMobil rose 0.8 per cent to $66.22 after the oil company beat expectations by posting a 55 per cent rise in quarterly profit on the back of higher oil prices. It boosted oil and gas output by 20 per cent compared with the same period last year.Elsewhere in energy, Halliburton tumbled 8 per cent to $31.68 after a US government report into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill said that the company knew that the cement it mixed to seal the well was unstable months before the blow-out.But US-listed shares in BP advanced 1.3 per cent to $40.60.In materials, PotashCorp, the fertiliser company, posted a 62 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings on the back of increasing demand and higher prices for key crop nutrients.US-listed shares in the company, which is the target of a hostile takeover bid by BHP Billiton, fell 3.3 per cent to $142.53 after having risen more than 50 per cent in the past three months.Elsewhere in materials, profit at Dow Chemical was boosted by strong sales in its commodity chemicals unit. Earnings beat expectations but its shares sank 1.6 per cent to $30.72.A rise in shoppers using their credit cards helped Visa beat expectations but its shares dropped 4.3 per cent to $76.45.The payment processing company also authorised a $1bn share buy-back plan. But some investors continued to be concerned about the possible impact of regulatory reform.Shares in Colgate-Palmolive dipped 0.8 per cent to $74.92 after it became the latest consumer products company to issue cautious guidance.Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark both reported earnings in the week and said that the climate for branded goods remained challenging. Colgate-Palmolive, the maker of Ajax cleaner and Colgate toothpaste, beat expectations this quarter but said that its 2011 earnings growth could slow.Motorola added 0.5 per cent to $8.13 after it posted a revenue increase for the first time in almost four years.Rising sales of its Droid handsets, which use Google’s Android operating system, helped the US mobile phone maker beat expectations.Rival Apple lost 0.8 per cent to $305.24 on fears that increased competition for the iPhone could hit future earnings.Before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures were unchanged after data showed initial applications for US jobless benefits unexpectedly fell last week and the total number of claimants dropped to a two-year low.
72;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2010-10-27T20:28:54Z;Upbeat earnings fail to cheer US investors;;Better-than-expected earnings from consumer goods companies including Procter & Gamble and Whirlpool failed to cheer investors, who focused instead on their cautious outlooks.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent to 1,182.45 on Wednesday, after paring its losses in the late afternoon as the rise in the dollar began to falter.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to close at 11,126.36 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,503.26.P&G edged up 0.4 per cent to $63.08 but the consumer staples index still fell by 0.5 per cent after the world’s largest consumer products company reported its quarterly earnings.Profit in its first quarter fell 6.8 per cent after it sold a pharmaceuticals division and suffered from rising commodity costs.But earnings were still slightly better than expected and sales just missed analysts’ estimates.The company also forecast earnings for the second quarter within a range that was a little less than it previously predicted because of commodity costs and a rise in marketing spending as a percentage of sales.“I think relative to where [P&G rival] Kimberly-Clark came in [on Tuesday], this is a pretty positive earnings report,” said Hank Smith, chief equity investment officer at Haverford Investments. “There’s a little bit of similarity to way back in the early-1990s when there was a period of economic weakness and a lot of branded companies were impacted. Its not a secular phenomenon, it's a cyclical fact.”He added that cost-cutting and strength in emerging markets was softening the blow at P&G.Shares in Kimberly-Clark suffered on Tuesday, falling 5.8 per cent, after it posted a 19 per cent drop in profit and lowered its forecasts because of rising materials costs.They continued to slide on Wednesday, down 0.4 per cent to $62.35.The consumer discretionary sector lost 0.5 per cent after home appliance makers beat expectations but warned that the outlook was volatile.Whirlpool said sales remained flat and it beat profit expectations by tightly controlling costs.Sales fell in the US and Europe as consumers refrained from buying large ticket items, some of which are closely tied to buying a new house, but sales grew in emerging markets. Its shares sunk 4.1 per cent to $81.04.Whirlpool’s announcement mirrored that of its Swedish competitor Electrolux, which reported its results earlier in the European session.US-listed shares in Electrolux dropped 4.4 per cent to $48.10.Before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures extended losses after a durable goods report showed that orders rose more than expected in September. But when the volatile transportation sector was excluded, orders actually fell.The S&P 500 industrials index lost 0.7 per cent with Boeing declining by 0.6 per cent to $70.86 and Caterpillar down by 0.6 per cent to $78.22.Dan Greenhaus, chief economist at Miller-Tabak, said business spending had shown a noticeable slowing over the past few months and it was one of the reasons why third-quarter GDP, due to be released on Friday, will not show a meaningful surprise on the upside.Elsewhere in earnings news, Comcast climbed 3.2 per cent to $20.27 after the largest cable operator in the US beat expectations with its quarterly earnings, excluding the costs related to its deal to take control of NBC Universal.Revenue was also better than expected as it sold more packages offering cable, phone and internet service, pushing up revenue per video customer and helping to compensate for customers who cut services because of the economy.But Sprint Nextel dropped 9.9 per cent to $4.30 after the mobile phone carrier reported a larger loss than expected.The company subsidised customer upgrades to phones capable of working on its new networks.The number of contract customers, who pay their bills after making the calls, fell at a lower rate but the company was still losing these valuable subscribers.
73;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2010-10-26T14:27:33Z;Kimberly-Clark hit by slow economy;;Kimberly-Clark, owner of the Huggies and Kleenex consumer brands, reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday that disappointed Wall Street, sending its shares down more than 4 per cent in early trading in New York.The company said it had been hit by falling volumes at its K-C Professional business, which supplies offices, hotels and restaurants, by lower promotional pricing in North America and by falling sales from its Venezuela business.Its net sales increased 1.3 per cent to $5bn, with organic sales up 1 per cent on increased volumes. Despite problems elsewhere, its personal care business saw organic sales volumes increase 5 per cent, with the company citing “broad-based strength in most regions of the world”.Tom Falk, chief executive, said demand in North America had been weaker than expected in July, as high unemployment continued to weigh on demand.“Overall the challenging environment weighed more heavily on our bottom line during the third quarter than we previously thought,” he said.Rising input costs, primarily for paper fibre, added an additional $265m to its costs compared with the same period last year.Earnings declined 19 per cent to $569, or $1.14 per diluted share, against a year ago, missing Wall Street’s consensus forecast, which called for earnings of $1.28.The company said it expected revenue growth for the full year of 3 per cent, the bottom of its previous 3 to 5 per cent range.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods company, reports its quarterly earnings on Wednesday.Kimberly-Clark’s shares were down 4 per cent at $63.46 at mid-morning in New York.
74;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2010-07-26T19:51:49Z;The price of a presence in Russia;;"Four years ago Yevgeny Chichvarkin was the king of Russia’s retail market. A backstreet kid with a knack for sales, Mr Chichvarkin co-founded Yevroset, a mobile phone store, in 1997 at the age of 22. With just $5,000 (€3,862, £3,227) in start-up capital, he soon turned it into Russia’s biggest handset retailer.An entrepreneur who dressed like a rock star, and was treated like one by his employees, Mr Chichvarkin made few friends among the police’s economic crimes department, which balked when he pushed to stamp out corruption in Russia’s grey phone market.Mr Chichvarkin’s closest partner at the time was Motorola. Neither came out of the ordeal well.The 35-year-old businessman is now awaiting an August 2 extradition trial in London on five-year-old charges of kidnapping and extortion, while Motorola has been forced to reduce its Russian operations after losing $2m there in a single day and fighting health claims put forward by the Russian interior ministry.The case is just one example of the problems besetting retail and manufacturing businesses in Russia as they battle opponents ranging from small-town bureaucrats and customs officials to former collective farmers.While investors say Russia’s retail sector is likely to be the chief beneficiary of its petrodollars over the next decade, many western multinationals are questioning how big they can afford to be in Russia given the risk of corruption. The problem makes Russia a less appealing place to work, as do related issues of bureaucracy that contribute to time and cost overruns.Ikea, a titan of the Russian retail market, has repeatedly frozen its investments in the country over the past couple of years while battling a wave of corruption scandals and court cases. Daimler, the carmaker, and Siemens, the industrial group, have both been rocked by allegations of bribery in Russia.Meanwhile, Kimberly-Clark, the health and hygiene group, is reeling from its initial investment experience in Russia after building its first factory there. The company was forced to change the property boundaries for its plant twice, the second time after a group of collective farmers declared part of the land theirs.“Many multinationals are thinking long and hard about how big their company in Russia ought to be – the bigger the company, the bigger the risk,” says Paul Melling, a partner at Baker & McKenzie and founder of the law firm’s Moscow office.In the past decade, companies say they have seen vast improvements in the quality of talent they are able to recruit and even a more solicitous attitude on the part of the Kremlin, which realised the value of foreign investment when capital outflows quickly reached $130bn in late 2008.President Dmitry Medvedev has promised to ramp up the fight against corruption and has taken action with a decree demanding senior officials to declare their income and properties. Yet just this month the president acknowledged his campaign had not met any “meaningful successes” and western businesses say any real changes will have to occur at the local, as well as federal, level.The president understands the problem of corruption, says Mr Melling. But, he adds, ultimately “it only takes one little bureaucrat out in Rostov to demand a bribe from a big retailer and that retailer will decide not to invest in Russia. That $200 bribe will cost the country millions of dollars in investments.”For many western businesses, the case of Mr Chichvarkin and Motorola is a reminder of the risks they and their peers continue to face in Russia.While Mr Chichvarkin is being charged with being complicit in the kidnap of a former Yevroset employee who stole $1m worth of phones from the company, and retrieving the money by force, his lawyers claim the case is a hangover from Mr Chichvarkin’s previous dealings with Department K, the interior ministry’s economic crimes division.Former industry colleagues of Mr Chichvarkin say he angered the dep­artment when he refused to pay bribes to interior ministry members in 2006, in order to clean up company practices in preparation for an initial public offering of the company in London. Shortly after, Department K seiz­ed a $20m shipment of Motorola phones heading for Yevroset stores, declaring them contraband, then counterfeit, then a health hazard. The London flotation was postponed.Department K did not respond to written request for comment.People close to Motorola say the multinational, like Yevroset, is continuing to feel the repercussions of the case and has been forced to readjust its strategy.“In one day, Motorola became a risky brand. If you wanted to trade with Motorola it could mean punishment from government structures,” says Eldar Murtazin, a writer for Mobile Review and an industry analyst at the time.In addition, retail customers turned their back on Motorola because of health hazard claims made by the interior ministry and the company saw its market share drop from 20 per cent to less than 1 per cent over the next four years, says Mr Murtazin.The experience outraged Motorola executives in the US, but ultimately they decided the company could not afford to pull out, a person close to Motorola says. The company declined to be interviewed for this article.Motorola is one of several manufacturers that have decided to remain in Russia in spite of significant problems, says Kristina Montgomery, a consultant at Frontier Strategy, a corporate advisory firm focused on emerging markets. While countries such as Indonesia and Mexico are becoming more attractive than Russia because they offer better demographics and less risk, Russia remains too big a market for most to ignore.“Russia remains very lucrative in terms of size and very lucrative in terms of the population. The fruit is still too tempting,” explains Ms Montgomery.When Candy, the Italian home ap­pliances maker, acquired its first plant in Russia five years ago, it knew it would have to invest a lot more money in the factory than the business it would get out of it. Yet it had no choice but to do so as higher tariffs started to make importing unprofitable, says Aldo Fumagalli, the group’s chief executive: “The advantage of manufacturing in Russia is one you just can’t avoid …We are trying to protect the market share we’ve been building up over the past 30 years and [these days] if you do not produce locally [and invest in the Russian economy], you cannot sell locally.“In the regions you can have a problem every day. If you have a good relationship with the local authorities, you solve them. If you don’t, you don’t solve them.”All companies hope to learn from Ikea, the company whose experience has become the example of everything that can go wrong in Russia.“Ikea made a lot of announcements before going into Russia [in 2000] that it was not going to change its business practices. One of the first things that the Russian authorities did was shut off the power at its grand opening …There’s this feeling of us versus them,” Ms Montgomery says.In the years since, the company has had to contend with a host of scandals. Earlier this year, the company admitted that members of its top management in Russia had permitted the bribery of state executives by one of its contractors; previously, Ikea delayed the opening of a retail location in Samara for more than a year after local officials claimed the building failed to meet safety regulations.Ikea says it is reshuffling its top management in Russia and so declined to comment until the new management is in place.When companies start talking about expanding into Russia, says Mr Melling, Ikea’s experience is usually cited. “One story, one company’s bad experience can have an enormous knock-on effect,” he says. Most companies do not fare quite so badly, he adds: “A lot of it’s luck …a lot of it’s misfortune.”"
75;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2010-07-26T19:37:19Z;US Inc plays on caution to issue bonds;;Some of the biggest industrial companies in the US are rushing to take advantage of soaring investor demand for corporate debt, with a flood of new issuance expected in coming weeks.Even as the yield on US shares rises to its highest in nearly 30 years relative to investment grade bonds and makes equities look cheap by comparison, the evidence in financial markets is that investors are favouring corporate debt over shares.Growing uncertainty over the global economy, which has sent stock markets tumbling since late April and contributed to increased volatility, has persuaded many investors that corporate debt is a safer, more attractive alternative to holding equities.As the earnings season has got under way, a string of blue-chip names has responded by issuing bonds. Alcoa, the aluminium maker, and Kimberly Clark were among the US companies borrowing money on Monday.This increase in activity is set to make July an important month for the US corporate bond markets. The value of new bonds sold will exceed the value of bonds that are expiring and reverse the trend of previous months.Barclays Capital expects net new supply by companies with investment grade ratings to be $25bn in July. In June it was a negative $20bn, while in May the market shrank by $27bn and in April just $2.5bn of net new debt was sold.Justin D’Ercole, head of Americas investment grade syndicate at Barclays Capital said: “April, May and June were really volatile, and borrowers did not need to step in and issue debt”.The shrinkage of the corporate market in May and June did not, however, reflect a lack of investor demand for corporate bonds. Indeed, investor appetite for bonds offering some pick-up relative to record low US Treasury debt has been on the rise.Fears of a looming double-dip recession have been the main driver pushing investors to seek the relative safety of bonds, particularly those seen as less risky and carrying investment grade credit ratings.Also, expectations that central banks in the US and Europe will keep interest rates at historically lower levels than was thought only a few months ago has increased the allure of holding debt. Moreover, investors holding debt rank higher than shareholders should a company collapse.Mark Kiesel, global head of corporate bond portfolio management at Pimco, said: “The asset allocation is moving up the capital structure. We see a lot of demand from clients around the world for high quality investments.”The jitters about the global recovery and concern about the possibility of deflation in the US and Europe have pushed yields on US Treasuries, considered the safest form of debt, to historic lows. On Monday, the yield on 10-year Treasuries was at just over 3 per cent.These extremely low borrowing costs for governments have fed through to all-time low borrowing costs for companies considered to be creditworthy.According to Barclays Capital, the yield paid on US corporate bonds over the last 20 years was on average 6.6 per cent. Now, the yield is at 4.07 per cent – far below that average. That has made issuing debt all the more attractive for big US companies.Even lower Treasury yields, and expectations that inflation will remain low, have encouraged investors to put their money in corporate debt, too.In contrast to the corporate bond markets, where net supply can be negative, there is no shortage of debt sales by governments, some funding record deficits.Mr Kiesel said: “The creditworthiness of governments is being questioned as they take on more debt from the deleveraging of the private sector.“Companies are hoarding cash, so the outlook for corporate bonds is good.”The demand for corporate debt comes even as some measures show US equities are at their most attractive relative to corporate bonds in decades.Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: “Equities, based on the risk premium relative to corporate bonds, are historically cheap”.After a rally that began in March 2009, US stock prices peaked in April before correcting nearly 20 per cent. Since that peak, however, company earnings have been robust and are projected to stay so. That earnings strength is in large part what makes equities look cheap by comparison.Indeed, the yield on shares, as calculated by expected dividend returns by JPMorgan, is at its highest versus investment-grade corporate bond yields since at least 1982.This spread, referred to as the equity risk premium, is about 4 per cent. It last peaked at the 2009 post-crisis market bottom, at about 3.5 per cent.A similar finding holds when considering trailing earnings instead of future cash flow, which relies on forecasts by companies and analysts.By that measure, Citigroup Global Markets calculates that stocks are yielding more than corporate bonds, only the fourth time since 1985 that stocks have yielded more than bonds, and by their widest margin.The spread reached its highest point on July 3, when the S&P 500, valued by the trailing four quarters of earnings, was yielding about 100 bp more than the average Baa-rated corporate bond, the lowest investment grade rating, according to Citigroup Global Markets.It has narrowed slightly since stocks have rallied again. But the month is on track to average the lowest spread for 25 years.The larger volumes of debt issued by companies will not change that. But, if corporate US borrowing is a sign of its confidence that now is the time to invest, that may ultimately be positive for equities. In that case, investors’ fears about the economic recovery could be overdone.Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock in New York

78;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2010-02-25T21:36:50Z;Walmart to set emissions goals for suppliers;;Walmart has become the first global retailer to set a target for its suppliers’ greenhouse gas reduction rather than for just its own operations, setting a goal of eliminating 20m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from its supply chain by the end of 2015.The retailer said on Thursday it would expand its efforts, which began in 2007, to work with big suppliers, including Dean Foods, Fox and Kimberly-Clark, to produce greenhouse gas reductions from steps such as reducing product packaging or changing the source of raw materials.Matt Kistler, Walmart’s head of sustainability, highlighted opportunities to reduce emissions in clothing and high intensity energy electronics, and sales of fresh food.Walmart estimated the direct footprint of its global store operations in 2008 at about 21m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, and the total has continued to rise as it continues to expand its stores. Its footprint is forecast to grow by more than 10m additional tonnes over the next five years even as it pursues its new supply chain goals.It has, however, reduced the volume of greenhouse gas emissions against sales, as it pursues a range of energy saving and alternative power initiatives.The company said it did not have an estimate for total emissions attributable to the products it sells, but Mr Kistler estimated that more than 90 per cent of its emissions came from its supply chain, rather than from its store and logistics operations.Walmart first set its own environmental sustainability targets in 2006 as part of a broad effort to improve its reputation. Its vast size and market influence have subsequently turned it into one of the most active US corporations on environmental issues.Mike Duke, chief executive repeated Walmart’s view that its efforts would ultimately lower prices for its customers, chiefly through resulting savings in energy use.The company, working with the Environmental Defence Fund, plans to produce a set of guidelines for itself and its suppliers to enable them to assess the extent of green house gas reductions. Claims will be verified by ClearCarbon, a consultancy, and reviewed by PriceWaterhouseCoopers.Walmart is also working with suppliers, academics and other parties on the creation of a single index on the environmental and social impact of products that could eventually be used in product labelling.It has also established a programme in China to work with its top 200 suppliers on increasing energy efficiency, and is using a “packaging scorecard” to encourage suppliers in the US to reduce packaging.The retailer, which has annual sales over over $400bn, has also said it intends to incorporate its vendors’ sustainability record into its buying decisions.
79;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2010-02-08T01:44:25Z;Montagu set to float BSN Medical;;BSN Medical, the German bandages maker, has become the latest private equity-owned company to prepare for an initial public offering after its owner Montagu hired Morgan Stanley to plan a flotation valuing it as high as €2bn ($2.7bn).However, there is likely to be strong interest in BSN from strategic buyers, such as 3M and Kimberly Clarke, and private equity groups, such as Apax Partners and Bain Capital. If they bid, Montagu may decide to sell BSN rather than float it.The recent wobble in equity markets is already causing trouble for other private equity-backed flotations. CVC Capital Partners was last week forced to pull the €420m IPO of Taminco, the Belgian chemicals group.In contrast, a rebound in debt markets is helping buy-out groups rediscover their appetite for deals. After sitting on the sidelines for two years during the financial crisis, buy-out groups are hungry to invest and see many IPO candidates as juicy targets.Healthcare is one of the most attractive sectors for private equity as it is expected to be relatively immune to any economic downturn due to the demographic pressures of ageing populations and the spread of improved medical technology. Buy-out groups are also expected to look at Ambea, the Nordic nursing homes operator, which is being prepared for a sale or flotation by 3i, its UK private equity owner.Another deal could be unveiled soon by Care UK, the nursing home and foster care group, which is in talks to be taken private by Bridgepoint for about £275m ($431m).The healthcare sector is expected to be the most active sector for deals this year, according to a survey of financial institutions by DLA Piper, the law firm, and Hawkpoint, the investment bank. The survey found 71 per cent of financiers expected healthcare to be an active sector for mergers and acquisitions, ahead of business and professional services and energy and natural resources.Nine out of 10 institutions said European deal volumes would increase this year. But three-quarters said that most deals would be worth below £150m and six out of 10 said liquidity for senior debt would never return to its credit bubble levels of 2007.Montagu put BSN up for sale 18 months ago but was forced to abandon the auction after the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered a financial crisis.The Hamburg-based company, created in 2001 as a joint venture between Smith & Nephew and Beiersdorf, is one of the most valuable assets in Montagu’s portfolio. The buy-out group, spun out of HSBC seven years ago, bought it for €1.03bn in 2005. Other groups that may be interested in BSN include Cardinal Health and Medline in the US and Sweden’s Mölnlycke Health Care.
80;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2010-01-22T18:12:00Z;Kimberly-Clark sees ‘modest recovery’ in 2010;;Kimberly-Clark, whose consumer brands include Scott, Kleenex, Huggies and Andrex, said on Friday it was predicting “a slow and modest economic recovery in 2010”, with global sales volumes growing 2 to 3 per cent, after being down slightly in 2009 amid a global consumer slump.The company reported fourth-quarter results that reflected its efforts to battle a shift by budget-conscious consumers in North America and Europe towards cheaper private-label versions of its core household products.Underlining the trend, volume sales of its Scott and Viva paper kitchen towels in North America fell by double digits during the quarter, due to “consumer trade-down” to cheaper rivals.But in other categories, the company successfully used aggressive promotional price cutting to maintain or increase sales, reporting a one per cent gain in market share for its Huggies diapers, and an 11 per cent sales volume increase for its Kotex feminine care products.During the quarter the company increased its marketing spending almost 20 per cent. Tom Falk, chief executive, said this had translated into an extra $140m spent on marketing in local currency terms.Sales of Kimberly-Clark’s professional products also remained sluggish, with organic sales volumes falling about 3 per cent, reflecting economic weakness and high unemployment in its main markets in North America and Europe.However, its higher-margin healthcare products business, which the company is seeking to expand, reported a 13 per cent increase in organic sales volumes, partly due to the acquisition of I-Flow Corp, a medical products company, in November. Almost half of the volume sales growth came from strong global demand for face masks linked to efforts to fight the H1N1 flu virus.Overall revenues increased 8.4 per cent to $5bn, with five percentage points of the gain coming from the weakness of the US dollar boosting international revenues. Earnings rose 17.4 per cent to $492m against the same period last year, when the company was weathering the onset of the global consumer slump.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer products company, reports its second-quarter results on Thursday.
81;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2010-01-12T23:18:02Z;Alchemist of all garbage;;Tom Szaky has very ambitious goals for TerraCycle, the recycling company he founded just over five years ago. “I want TerraCycle to become a verb, like Google,” he says of the small company, based in an old factory building in the post-industrial wasteland of Trenton, New Jersey. “We hope to wake up one day and become the new version of recycling, where every waste stream has a solution within the TerraCycle system.”The 27-year-old Mr Szaky founded his company with just one waste stream – leftover food from the cafeteria at nearby Princeton University, where he was a student, which was fed to worms and turned into fertiliser and sold in discarded soda bottles.But after a rapid journey that few start-ups can claim to emulate, he is dealing with the waste flow of some of the US’s biggest consumer companies, including Kraft, Mars, PepsiCo, Kimberly-Clark and General Mills, al­though TerraCycle’s turnover was just $12.5m (€8.7m, £7.8m) last year.The recycling logo that Mr Szaky says he designed during an uninspiring lecture at Princeton now appears on an estimated 1.5bn familiar consumer packages in stores across the US, ranging from Capri-Sun juice drinks to M&M sweets. “It will be on 20bn to 30bn packages by the end of 2010, on a global basis,” he says.TerraCycle’s five warehouses across the US receive millions of items of wrapping and packaging, collected by more than 8m people, including schools and charities, who may get 2 or 3 cents per wrapper. Together with other items, such as flawed rolls of packaging material, the waste is ultimately recycled into products such as bins, backpacks and pencil cases.This year, TerraCycle expanded to open offices and recycling warehouses in Canada, Brazil, the UK, France and Germany – yet it has just 55 employees. The waste it collects is turned into more than 100 different products, including injected plastic made from old foil crisp packets, thanks to a recently developed process.After losing $4.5m in 2008, the company is now operating profitably, as it continues to double its turnover every year. This is in spite of tearing up the rule book on expanding a start-up: “Everything we do, you are not supposed to do,” says Mr Szaky. That included signing some early, almost overwhelming, contracts to sell its worm-waste product to Home Depot and Walmart Canada, as well as developing a big range of products, and expanding overseas (see panel).Mr Szaky’s original idea for the worm business grew out of a start-up business plan he entered for a competition at Princeton. But serendipity rather than MBA science seems to have shaped TerraCycle’s business, mixed with on-the-hoof inventiveness, occasional luck and plenty of ambition. “It’s how I like to do business. I am willing to take some risk, to put some capital down and test an idea,” says Mr Szaky. “I don’t want to sit and debate with anyone whether it’s a good or bad idea.”The business has undergone two big shifts. The worm-waste operation was bubbling along in 2007, and TerraCycle had begun paying “collection brig­ades” to send in used soda bottles for the packaging. That led to a deal with Danone’s Stonyfield Yoghurt to collect and reuse yoghurt pots.Then Mr Szaky was approached by Honest Tea, a small ethically focused start-up, which wanted a way to process foil and plastic children’s juice pouches, whose composite nature made them unsuited to regular recycling. Under the deal, Honest Tea’s packages were made into branded backpacks – and into a dress worn by Soyeon Lee, Mr Szaky’s Korean pianist wife, at her Carnegie Hall debut in New York in 2008. This was one example of his ability to win free publicity – which also includes writing a book, Revolution in a Bottle , that includes tales of gunfights between local gangs and fending off venture capitalists.But the far bigger transformation came later that year, after TerraCycle came into possession of piles of recycled juice pouches from Kraft’s Capri-Sun brand that had been collected in a state-run project in British Columbia. Mr Szaky proposed that Capri-Sun join the Honest Tea programme.“Tom found us, as opposed to us finding him” says Jeff Chahley, Kraft’s senior director for sustainability, who describes the decision to launch the scheme with a small start-up as “a calculated risk”.“Capri-Sun signed a million-dollar contract right off the bat, and they basically exploded the programme,” says Mr Szaky.Other Kraft brands followed, as did more consumer companies. But growth brought new challenges in meeting demand for new products, as TerraCycle was trying both to continue product development and oversee the manufacturing. “Kraft wanted more kids’ products, Aveeno [owned by Johnson & Johnson] wanted its brand around more cosmetic products,” he says. But the costs of developing products and handling the manufacture and merchandising to retailers was too much.“We could either completely scale back, and focus on a handful of products, which I really didn’t want to do. Or we come up with another solution,” says Mr Szaky.The solution, launched last year, was licensing, an idea Mr Szaky says occurred to him when he was in California discussing waste recycling with Hollywood studios, in what he calls “a totally random connection”.TerraCycle tested one licensed product, a billboard bag for Yak Pak, a small New York-based bag company. “It was just throwing an idea against a wall to see if it worked, and the moment it worked, we aggressively said: ‘We’re not making products any more, we’re licensing everything.’“The effect was phenomenal. We are now profitable, next year we will be high­ly profitable. The number of products we make exploded . . . and the sales of our products tripled overnight. And the risk disappeared.”But the shift also required an overhaul of TerraCycle’s model. “In 2008 we lost a tremendous amount of money. I went in a direction that many people thought was not a good direction. And the financials tanked, which made it even harder to justify it as the right move. What solved it was the transition to licensing.TerraCycle now has a head of licen­sing, who was formerly at Disney, to supervise a unique product licensing programme in which the licensor also supplies some raw material.Mr Szaky believes he has achieved through trial and error the model that will enable the company to become the “Google of recycling”, establishing itself as the global standard setter.“We’re taking the global expansion very aggressively . . . The gas pedal is pushed as deep as it can to continue growth. The big challenge at this point is managing that growth.”
82;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2009-12-12T01:52:31Z;Unilever and Coke vow to cut emissions;;Unilever and Coca-Cola, two of the world’s biggest companies, have launched a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the $1,000bn global consumer goods industry by changing the behaviour of customers and suppliers.Other multinationals, including PepsiCo, Kimberly Clark and Alcoa, are expected to join the initiative, according to one executive involved. It reflects the pressure on big companies to be seen to act responsibly in the face of climate change.Muhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, said: “I have brought all my suppliers together for a two-day meeting and told them: ‘This train is leaving the platform’.”Unilever also said it had stopped buying oil from an Indonesian company, PT Smart, amid Greenpeace allegations that its plantations destroyed forests.The consumer goods initiative was launched as businesses urged governments at the Copenhagen conference to provide a clear lead on controlling greenhouse gases to give them the stability they needed for investment.Coca-Cola and Unilever said they were taking a broader view of the environmental effect of their products, looking at the emissions from their suppliers and customers. Unilever estimates that for every tonne of greenhouse gas it emits, 10 are emitted by its suppliers and 30-60 by customers using its products.Unilever decided to stop buying palm oil from PT Smart after it was shown a Greenpeace report making claims against PT Smart’s environmental practices. “They showed us evidence we can’t ignore,” it said.Executives of PT Sinar Mas, PT Smart’s parent company, have regularly denied wrongdoing.
83;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2009-10-09T20:34:41Z;Wall Street ends week on a high note;;Wall Street on Friday recorded its first full week of consecutive gains since November 2006 after strength in technology stocks added to this week’s rally.International Business Machines rose 3 per cent to $125.93 after Barclays upgraded computer hardware companies, saying storage and server demand was picking up.Google also rose 0.4 per cent to $516.25 after Credit Suisse raised its price target on the stock, citing a potential rebound in advertising. The market initially opened lower as investors mulled over comments from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, who said late on Thursday that the central bank could tighten monetary policy as the economic recovery takes hold.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,071.49 and the Nasdaq gained 0.7 per cent to 2,139.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per to a high for the year of 9,864.94. Over the course of the week, the S&P rose 4 per cent - its biggest weekly gain since July. The Dow rose 3.4 per cent and the Nasdaq was 4 per cent higher.Positive economic data, the weak dollar and rising commodity prices pushed stocks higher this week. After Wednesday’s close, Alcoa set a positive tone for the third-quarter earnings season by posting a profit and, on Thursday, leading US retailers reported their first monthly sales gain since September 2008.Bruce Shalett, founder of the Wynston Hill Capital boutique investment bank, said: “There’s reason to feel cautiously optimistic. The retail data that came out resonated very positively with investors who are hoping upon hope for reasons to believe that the recovery is sustainable.”Citigroup was in focus on Friday after confirming it would sell its controversial Phibro commodities business to Occidental Petroleum. Occidental said its net investment in the business would total about $250m and the deal is expected to help deflect political anger over a potential $100m pay-out for its star trader Andrew Hall. While financial stocks were broadly up, Citi shares lost 0.4 per cent to $4.63.Government-backed mortgage lenders also weighed on the sector. Edward DeMarco, the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said late on Thursday that the mortgage groups might need further aid from the US Treasury. Fannie Mae was down 4 per cent to $1.43 and Freddie Mac lost 3.9 per cent to $1.71.Shares in both companies fell on Wednesday, in spite of a broad rally in the financial sector, after reports suggested they were working on a programme to help independent mortgage banks get access to short-term credit for home loans.Retreating commodity prices hit mining and industrial stocks in early trading on Friday.Newmont Mining suffered further after speculation that the company could be preparing a hostile bid for Australia’s Newcrest Mining. Newmont shares were down 1.1 per cent at $46.50.Chevron said late on Thursday that higher oil prices would lead to significantly better profits in the third quarter than the previous one. The shares were up 1.8 per cent at $72.76.Such optimism did not spread to its rivals and ExxonMobil trailed the market, gaining 0.3 per cent to $69.927. ConocoPhillips lost 1.2 per cent to $50.78 after announcing it would temporarily shut down parts of its refinery in Texas for maintenance.A flurry of deal activity helped lift sentiment. Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues, announced it had bought I-Flow for $324m. Kimberly-Clark gained 0.3 per cent to $59.23, while shares in I-Flow, which sells surgical products such as catheters, rose 7 per cent to $12.58.Sunrise Senior Living, the retirement home group that warned this year of possible bankruptcy, agreed to sell 21 of its assisted living communities to an affiliate of rival Brookdale Senior Living for $204m.Sunrise shares rose 44.6 per cent to $4.77.
84;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2009-08-04T23:13:35Z;Budget-conscious consumers boost Kraft;;"US shoppers are still opting for Kraft’s low-cost macaroni and cheese dinners to save money, but recent results from several US consumer companies suggest the “trading down” trend that emerged with last year’s economic crisis might be starting to level off.Kraft, the largest US food company, reported on Tuesday that sales of its “mac and cheese” dinners again grew by double digits in the three months ending on June 30 against the same period last year, compared to single digit growth before the crisis began.The company also reported continued strength in its US home pizza business, with its DiGiorno brand growing at least 20 per cent. However, it saw declines in sales to restaurants and other food service locations, reflecting the tendency by consumers to save money by eating at home.But in a potential sign of strengthening confidence among more prosperous consumers, Whole Foods Market, the upmarket natural and organic food store, reported the first sequential improvement in its same store sales after six quarters of sequential declines.Same store sales were down 2 per cent excluding currency fluctuations, compared with a 4.1 per cent decline in the previous quarter.John Mackey, chief executive, said the improvement was “driven by both average transaction count and basket size trends” at its more than 260 stores across the country. “It’s green shoots really; it’s signs of momentum, it’s signs of stability,” Mr Mackey said, while warning that “it is too early to call where this is going . . . but there are lots of encouraging signs”.The improved sales trends at Whole Foods, whose higher price stores were heavily hit by consumers’ shift to lower cost alternatives, mirror similar trends seen last month at Starbucks, the coffee retailer, which also saw a sequential improvement in its same store sales in its most recent quarter.Whole Foods’ executives said they had seen a decline in the proportion of own label products sold at its stores from levels seen earlier in the recession, echoing comments from several national brand consumer companies.David Mackay, chief executive of Kellogg’s, said last week that the cereal company had begun to see own label market share in its categories decline in the US and around the world. “While it did have a very strong spurt of share growth, [own label share] is now levelling off a little bit.”But he warned that customers “are still going to be in a mindset of looking for value and trying to extract as much value as they can out of every dollar they spend”, and would remain wary of returning to spending money on dining out.Away from food, Kimberly-Clark, the paper products company, also said last month that own label products either lost market share or remained level for a second consecutive quarter in the US."
85;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2009-08-03T18:59:59Z;Clorox gets sales boost from flu outbreak;;Clorox, maker of bleach and other cleaning products, on Monday joined a select group of US companies that have seen sales lifted by the H1N1 swine flu pandemic.Larry Peiros, chief operating officer, said sales volumes of bleach cleaners had risen by 10-15 per cent during the fourth quarter against a year ago due to swine flu fears, with strong growth in Latin America.“We are preparing for the potential of H1N1 . . . expanding during the traditional flu system, and we’re working closely with our retailer partners to take advantage of any opportunities that may accrue to us,” Mr Peiros said.Don Knauss, chief executive, said the company had noted an increase in concern over disinfecting public areas at locations such as airports that was creating a demand for products.Sales of liquid bleach under brand names including Clorox and Ayudin account for about a quarter of Clorox’s sales outside North America, including in Mexico, where the H1N1 virus was first identified in April.In Mexico, the company’s marketing and information campaigns linked to the flu outbreak have included offering guidance on using its products to disinfect hotel rooms, restaurants and offices as well as homes. In May, it donated cases of bleach worth $100,000 to the Mexican Red Cross and government agencies.Reckitt-Benckiser, owner of the Lysol and Dettol brand disinfectants, has also been actively promoting its products globally as a weapon against the spread of swine flu.Kimberly-Clark and 3M, who manufacture disposable paper face-masks, both reported a surge in demand for their masks since the start of the H1N1 outbreak.Makers of anti-bacterial hand soaps have also reported stronger demand linked to flu concerns. PZ Cussons, a UK company that makes Carex hand sanitiser, said last week it had seen weekly sales triple since before the flu outbreak.For Clorox, the increased sales in its international business, which accounts for about 15 per cent of its sales, were offset by a 3 per cent decline in sales volumes in North America against last year, partly reflecting its decision to exit its private label food bag business. In dollar terms, overall sales were flat, at $1.5bn, as the stronger dollar weighed on its international earnings.However the company reported an 8 per cent increase in earnings to $170m, or $1.20 per share, as it benefited from lower commodity costs and cost-cuttting efforts that helped it to increase its gross profit margins.
86;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2009-07-23T16:16:23Z;Swine flu fears boost Kimberly-Clark sales;;The threat of the H1N1 flu virus boosted global sales of paper face masks made by Kimberly-Clark, the company said on Thursday, even as the slump in consumer demand continued to weigh on sales of brands including Huggies and Kleenex.The company said soaring demand for face masks supported a 14 per cent increase in sales volumes in its healthcare division during its second quarter, with almost half of the gain attributable to demand for face masks.Tom Falk, chief executive, said the company still had a substantial number of orders for more masks, and was expecting increased demand going in to the latter part of the year amid concerns that the flu virus will resume its spread.“You’re finding a lot of people wanting to put more aggressive crisis management plans in place, and that usually involves stocking up with face masks,” he said.The strong healthcare unit sales contributed to quarterly results that saw the company improve its gross profit margins due to cost cutting and lower commodity prices, while reporting improved operating margins and cash flow.“Those things were a really positive step for us….it feels like an inflection point at this stage,” Mr Falk said.In the US, the company still faced a seven per cent fall in volume sales of its Huggies nappies and a 10 per cent fall in demand for Kleenex paper tissues, while unit sales of toilet paper fell two per cent.Sales at its K-C Professional services division, which supplies and services washrooms in businesses, were also down 10 per cent, with lower demand from heavy industry and travel related businesses. But Mr Falk said the company had seen “green shoots” of potential growth demand from sectors including healthcare and overseas sales.Kimberly Clark has stepped up cost cutting efforts, and announced last month that it would cut 1,300 jobs, or 3 per cent of its workforce. During the quarter it also moved to reduce inventories by stopping production at some manufacturing plants.“Assuming demand holds up at current levels we wouldn’t see a big amoung of down time in the balance of the year,” he said.The cost cutting efforts and lower commodity prices led to an increase in gross profit margin of approximately 350 basis points against the same period last year.Overall revenues fell 5.6 per cent to $4.7bn, as the impact of the stronger dollar offset organic sales growth of nearly 3 per cent that was supported by higher net selling prices. Overall volume sales declined by around 2 per cent.Net income fell 3.4 per cent to $403m, or 97 cents per diluted share.Kimberly-Clark’s shares gained over 4 per cent to $57.12 at lunchtime in New York.
87;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2009-06-23T04:02:00Z;Consumer goods companies eye online sales;;Target, the leading US discounter, recently provided a stark illustration of why consumer goods companies are interested in a new e-commerce site that offers the chance to sell – and speak – directly to their customers.Under the slogan “favour the brands priced right”, one of the retailer’s weekly newspaper insert ads displayed its own private label kitchen bags, headache pills and cleaners directly alongside more expensive brand name products from SC Johnson, Clorox and Wyeth.Mike McGuire, co-founder of Alice.com, noted on the start-up website’s blog that the Target ad “represents a battle for market share worth $100’s of billions” – a battle that has intensified as the recession has pushed shoppers towards cheaper alternatives.He and his co-founder Brian Wiegand argue that their start-up will help consumer goods companies adjust a balance of power that has been leaning increasingly in favour of retailers – because of factors including decline in ability of leading brands to dominate marketing messages via television and newspapers.Consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies such as Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark have all stepped up spending on the internet in an effort to establish new direct links to their customers.But unlike the makers of higher cost items such as Hermes ties or Body Shop cosmetics, it has not made economic sense for them to try to sell their low-margin items directly to consumers online. That has left them dependent on conventional retailers for both sales and data, as well as for access to in-store marketing opportunities.US online retailers such as Diapers.com and Drugstore.com have sought to tap online demand for CPG products, but at prices that are above bricks and mortar store rivals. Amazon has focused on selling bulk packages of goods, offering discounts on a subscription service that automatically repeats orders.The higher online costs mean sales of low margin household goods have lagged far behind other categories, at less than one per cent, compared to an overall figure for US retail of around 6 per cent.But CPG companies have still showed increasing interest in online sales, with P&G’s main sites now linked to “where to buy” list of online retailers. P&G has also acquired a small stake in Ocado, the UK online retailer, showing a particular interest in the customer data yielded by online sales, according to a source familiar with the relationship.If Alice.com can indeed deliver toothpaste and soap online for the same price as a mass retailer, and with free shipping, it would be addressing what one of the main blocks to greater online sales.If it works, that would also provide more of shopper data direct to the CPG companies, together with the opportunity to direct online coupons and promotions to new and existing customers with far more specifity than conventional “pay and spray” promotions.Success will ultimately depend on whether its advertising-based revenue model will work, and whether it can cover the costs of delivery that have bedevilled efforts to develop online sales of toilet paper, household towels and laundry detergent.
88;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2009-06-17T15:15:17Z;Executives face up to inevitable changes;;In a July 2002 speech in New York, President George W Bush implored business leaders to heed the lessons that emerged from the collapse of Enron, WorldCom and other companies laid to waste by the actions of their top executives.“We need men and women of character who know the difference between ambition and destructive greed, between justified risks and irresponsibility, between enterprise and fraud,” Mr Bush said. “Those who sit on corporate boards have responsibilities.”Seven years later, his successor, Barack Obama, is preaching those same tenets to a corporate world whose reputation has been sullied once again by the behaviour of some of its great success stories.The financial crisis that overwhelmed some of the world’s banks, brokers and insurers last year exposed fresh weaknesses in corporate governance, leaving shareholders to question whether their long-term interests were sacrificed for the short-term gains of senior executives.Ken Daly, chief executive of the National Association of Corporate Directors, says: “Maybe more so than from the isolated Enron thing, there is a risk to the confidence in corporate America, a tearing of the fabric.”And just as the scandals, indictments and bankruptcies of earlier this decade gave rise to more independent boards and stiffer financial-disclosure rules, breakdowns at Bear Stearns, AIG and other fallen giants will prompt corporate directors and regulators alike to identify a new wave of reforms.Of course, they will be different, reflecting the set of circumstances that left the fate of some of the largest and most powerful financial services companies in the hands of traders and bankers who were compensated for their aggression and unchecked risk-taking.“The profound governance failures of the past year are different from Enron and WorldCom,” says Ben Heineman, a former senior vice-president for law and public affairs at General Electric and now a senior fellow at Harvard University’s law and government schools.“Those were intentional frauds committed by business leaders who blew through systems. Today’s financial crisis resulted primarily from negligence, where all the systems failed – failures in finance, accounting, risk, law, operational leadership, top leadership and the board.”US lawmakers have put forth proposals that, if passed, would alter the corporate governance policies of many companies.“Change is inevitable,” says Dennis Beresford, professor at the University of Georgia who sits on the boards of Fannie Mae, Kimberly-Clark and Legg Mason.One such measure would enhance shareholders’ ability to propose alternative candidates to management’s choice of directors. Another would give them a chance to voice their disproval of executive compensation while forcing corporate boards to create risk-management committees.Those committee members need to ensure a company’s various business units’ risks are aggregated, says Parvez Patel, vice-president of capital markets at risk for CapGemini Financial Services.The absence of this kind of oversight left top executives and boards at many of the large financial services firms unable to avoid the steep losses that followed their employees’ risks.“You need to understand what is happening on the front line of the business,” says Mr Patel. “And that information needs to percolate up through the oversight committee.”While new regulations may establish minimum standards or strengthen existing rules, shareholders alone can effect the kind of lasting reforms that would help companies avoid shortcomings that helped exacerbate the recent crisis. That is the view of Ralph Whitworth, whose activist money-management firm, Relational Investors, has sought to improve governance at companies such as Sprint Nextel, Home Depot and Genzyme.“The bottom line is that most directors in corporate America have high IQs and integrity, but lack the information and incentives to do their job,” says Mr Whitworth, a one-time adviser to T Boone Pickens, the oilman and corporate raider.“Investors can’t sit by the wayside and wait for government to address these problems. Are they going to pick up a cudgel and demand accountability? Within a capital system, accountability has to be exacted by the investors.”It is likely more companies will move to split the roles of chief executive and chairman, a move that help advance the independence of boards from company managements.Yale University’s Millstein Center for Corporate Governance and Performance, says: “The independent chair curbs conflicts of interest, promotes oversight of risk, manages the relationship between the board and the CEO, serves as a conduit for regular communication with shareowners, and is a logical next step in the development of an independent board.”But this bifurcation may not work well for corporations whose top executives receive hefty payments if their titles change, Mr Daly says. In these cases, the appointment of a lead director may be the best option.“There needs to be either separation or a designation of lead director,” he says. “Either can work. It is a matter of what’s best for the company.”Another shift that was already in train before the financial crisis struck is the way in which corporate boards reward their companies’ top executives.“Compensation is going to change enormously,” Mr Daly says.More companies will seek to align executive pay with long-term strategic goals, says Matteo Tonello, associate director of the Conference Board.“There will be a correction of the distortions in compensation incentives that were often used in the past, especially certain equity-based incentives – stock options,” Mr Tonello says.“They have proven by now to have had the unintended consequence of encouraging execs to pursue short-term behaviour in lieu of long-term business goals. Excessive risk-taking has been too common.”That being said, Mr Tonello notes the progress that many corporate boards have made in the past decade. It is unfair, he argues, to blame the financial-services meltdown on sub-standard corporate governance.While some reforms have come about as a result of new regulation, many others were voluntary.Boards have grown more independent, and less entrenched, Mr Tonello says. More directors maintain an open dialogue with investors.“They’re not cronies of the CEO,” he said.Another by-product of the financial crisis, a steep drop in many stock prices, may also embolden shareholders to take some of these corporate-governance reforms into their own hands.“There’s a heightened expectation of what directors can and should be doing,” Mr Daly explains.A complacent management team and board, coupled with disappointing results, can inspire the kind of ire that former Home Depot CEO Robert Nardelli drew in 2006.His performance at the home-improvement retailer’s annual meeting, in which he refused to answer questions and ended the event after just 35 minutes, alienated shareholders and outraged corporate-governance advocates.Within a year, he was gone.Still, the outrage that many investors feel – which, in turn, is driving many changes to corporate governance policies – may subside, as the economy recovers and share prices rebound.“Shareholders basically want performance,” Mr Beresford says. “For most of them, so long as the company is doing well, they’re basically satisfied. It’s only when something is underperforming that they start getting upset and blaming people.”Uncertain when their businesses will rebound from the severe downturn, many corporate boards will seek to do the next best thing: ensuring that managers have the right incentives to assure the recovery arrives as soon as possible.
89;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2009-06-12T23:29:19Z;General Electric appoints Beattie to board;;General Electric on Friday appointed Thomson Reuters executive W. Geoffrey Beattie as its 16th board director and promoted Norman Liu to head its aviation finance division.Mr Beattie, 49, is Thomson’s deputy chairman and chief executive of Woodbridge, the electronic media company’s controlling shareholder. At GE, he fills the board seat vacated by Claudio X. Gonzalez, chairman of Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, who retired in April.“Geoff Beattie’s expertise in information services, financial services and multimedia make him an ideal addition to GE,” Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive, said on Friday. “His guidance on these and other issues will be invaluable to the board and to GE business leaders.”GE counts a media business, NBC Universal, and a massive commercial and consumer finance arm, GE Capital, among its portfolio of companies.Mr Liu, 51, was named president and chief executive of GE Capital Aviation Services, one of the world’s largest aircraft lessors. A 22-year veteran at GE Capital, he succeeds his longtime boss, Henry Hubschman, who will remain with the company as chairman of GECAS.Under Mr Hubschman’s direction, GECAS emerged as a reliable source of leased aircraft and powerful influence within the aviation industry.Benefiting from GE’s access to cheap debt, market insight gleaned from the conglomerate’s aircraft engines business, and the stumbles of some of its less-capitalised peers, GECAS’s assets swelled from $10bn to more than $46bn in the past 12 years. Today its fleet of about 1,500 aircraft are leased to 250 airlines in more than 70 countries.As a key deputy during Mr Hubschman’s run as the division’s CEO, serving as executive vice-president of commercial operations, Mr Liu told the Financial Times that GECAS’s “strategy remains largely intact”.Nevertheless his ascension comes as the aviation industry endures one of the worst downturns in its history. Mr Liu said he was hopeful air-travel demand would begin to recover next year. “How pronounced is the $64,000 question,” he said. “I see emerging markets coming out of this faster.”Including Mr Beattie, 13 of GE’s board members are deemed independent directors. He will sit on the audit committee.Mr Beattie, a former partner at Torys, a Toronto law firm, joined Woodbridge in 1998. He is also a director at Royal Bank of Canada and Maple Leaf Foods, and serves as chairman of CTVglobemedia, a Canadian broadcaster.
90;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2009-06-12T06:17:04Z;Clorox to launch ‘green’ detergent;;Clorox, the US company whose flagship brand is chlorine bleach, is launching a plant-based “natural” laundry detergent, underlining the continued move by large consumer companies into premium “green” products despite the recession.Don Knauss, chief executive officer, said that the new detergent was aimed at a “super-premium” area which the company believed was comparatively immune to economic concerns.“We still think about 15 to 25 per cent of consumers are still very focused on elminating chemicals from their home,” he said. “And we still think that despite the recession there is a pretty robust group of people that still use green as a clear decision maker.”The new product will cost about 10 per cent more than traditional liquid detergents. This summer has also seen the launch by Kimberly-Clark of a “pure and natural” premium-priced version of its Huggies nappies. SC Johnson, the cleaning products company, also launched its first range of green branded cleaning products, called “Nature’s Source”, in January this year.Beth Springer, head of Clorox’s natural personal care businesses, said the Green Works brand, launched nationally in January 2008, now had over $100m in annual sales in the US, and accounted for almost half the total market for equivalent home cleaning products. Clorox’s total revenue was $5.3bn last year.Clorox is now taking the brand into the extremely competitive $11bn US laundry detergent market, dominated by Procter & Gamble’s Tide brand. Mr Knauss said the company would be satisfied if it could take 1-2 per cent of the overall market, saying the company was targeting a profitable niche, rather than a large market.Ms Springer said that sales of Clorox’s Burt’s Bees products — a natural personal care brand it acquired in 2007 — had dropped sharply at the end of last year from the double-digit growth seen in the first year of the acquisition, as consumers cut back.However, she said the brand would continue to grow this year, supported by expanded distribution and by customers shopping across an expanded range of produces.She also said that Clorox planned to focus on Burt’s Bees and Green Works as it continued to expand its international sales, which currently account for only around 16 per cent of its revenue.For its 2010 fiscal year, which begins on July 1, Clorox is forecasting sales growth of 1 to 2 per cent, including an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of 2 percentage points.
91;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2009-06-03T19:42:16Z;Out to launch in a downturn;;Brad Casper, the head of Henkel’s US consumer products business, says he can get core customers of his Purex detergent brand to spend more on their laundry – even in a deep recession.The company has an idea it believes could shake up the market: a souped-up version of the anti-static fabric sheets used in American tumble dryers. Henkel’s version is put in at the start of the washing cycle and includes concentrated detergent and fabric softener.Purex, a low-cost brand, has about 10 per cent of the US market. Its Complete 3-in-1 Laundry Sheets are about 20 per cent more expensive per wash than buying the Purex versions of the three ingredients separately.Mr Casper says the recession could even help the launch of a product that has taken five years to develop. “It’s absolutely the right time because your share of voice is so much larger,” he says. The launch includes national television advertising and race-car sponsorship. In addition to lower media marketing costs, there are fewer new products to compete against as other companies cut back on spending.Henkel is not alone: other big brands are bringing out products at an apparently unpromising time. Colgate-Palmolive has launched four-packs of disposable mini-toothbrushes and mouth freshener, called Wisp, which it says address the “currently unmet need of on-the-go tooth cleaning” – but which cost more than breath-freshening strips.­Kimberly-Clark has launched a premium “pure and natural” version of its Huggies baby products. Procter & Gamble’s recent recession-era innovations include Olay Pro-X, a range of “clinical” anti-ageing products that sell for about twice the price of its regular Olay anti-ageing creams.Tony Palmer, chief marketing officer of Kimberly-Clark, argues that economic conditions are less important to a product’s success than whether it is aimed at genuine customer needs. “If you do those things, chances are you’ll be successful whether you are in a recession or not, or whether you have a premium product or not,” he says.The company’s Scott’s brand launched its first cardboard roll of paper towel in 1930, in the middle of the Great Depression.But while the central principles of identifying and marketing an attractive innovation remain the same, Mr Palmer says, “the consumer is changing”. As a result, “maybe the decisions we make as a result of the work we are doing are varying” – such as the use of ­coupons and free samples to encourage customers to try new products, and changing the marketing mix.Purex decided to retest consumer acceptance for the new product in January, after the collapse of the stock markets and the surge in economic anxiety, Mr Casper says. A positive response “led to the conclusion that there was no reason we shouldn’t do the launch”, the largest of its kind undertaken by the brand.In spite of the consumer mood for saving money, Purex will not use free sam­ples to encourage people to try it. The company believes the product is attractive enough to allow Henkel to direct marketing funds to other advertising efforts to build consumer awareness.Michael Kuremsky, general manager of the Olay brand at P&G, says the Pro-X product, which costs at least $42, is markedly more expensive than other Olay products. But it is aimed at a more prosperous customer, who would be used to spending $100 or more on similar products in department stores rather than in drug stores.“The prices are, yes, high and up-price for the mass channel, but actually they are a value for this particular consumer,” he says, describing the product as one of the company’s “big ideas”.Aware that the economic mood could deter some customers from trying the product, P&G offered a money-back guarantee and high-value rebates to drive sales while trying to maintain the product’s premium status. A customer who spent more than $50, for instance, would qualify for a $25 voucher to spend on future purchases.“We had a lot of conversation about this …We knew we had to take the economic crunch seriously,” says Mr Kuremsky. P&G decided it would have to focus on persuading consumers to try the product.Some product launches, in contrast, have unexpectedly found they are aligned with the current recessionary consumer mood. Purex’s tests of its laundry sheets indicated that consumers, while cutting back in many areas, were receptive to something new that could introduce some excitement into their shopping, as a small domestic luxury.Overall, however, product launches slow during a recession. In the US food industry, Mintel, the consumer research firm, has data showing that the number of food and drink products introduced in the first three months of 2009 was down 51 per cent on the previous year, and down 32 per cent on the previous month.As for those that go ahead, Lynn Dornblaser, who tracks new products at Mintel, says for some companies it can be “very hard to turn the ship around” on a planned product launch, even if they want to. Some, she says, try to focus on their biggest ideas, particularly if a product is close to launch. “Instead of having 10 or 12 things going on at once, they focus on one or two really big ones,” she says.But initial results from some of the larger product launches suggest that if you make the right product, consumers will come, even in a recession.­Colgate-Palmolive has reported strong initial sales of its Wisp mini-toothbrushes – 7 per cent of the toothbrush market in the first week of April.Olay’s Pro-X has taken about 5 per cent of the anti-ageing clinical market, says Mr Kuremsky at P&G, which is “right on track for what we were planning”.As the Purex product hits the store shelves, Mr Casper is optimistic that the laundry sheets have the potential to become a $100m brand in their first year.
92;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2009-02-23T23:07:48Z;Coupon clippers go digital;;This Saturday’s “Extreme Couponing 101” workshop at the leisure centre in Lexington, South Carolina, is entirely booked out, with 30 people paying $10 each for a two-hour course in how to save money when shopping.The event is organised by Jenny, the author of Southern Savers, one of a plethora of online blogs devoted to the art of saving money when shopping, traditionally by clipping the coupons delivered each weekend with the local newspaper.But Southern Savers’ expertise now goes beyond the familiar coupon clipper techniques – such as joining shopper loyalty programmes or waiting for retailers to “double up” the savings offered on manufacturers’ coupons. The blog – and others such as Simply Thrifty or The Frugal Mamma – now embraces the internet and the mobile phone, as big name retailers and manufacturers increasingly commit themselves to delivering coupons online.Kmart, one of the largest US discounters, is launching printable manufacturers’ coupons on its website this month, joining Kroger, the largest US supermarket group, and CVS and Walgreens, the drugstores, which launched printable coupons last year.Kroger has also recently expanded a pilot programme that it launched last year with Cellfire, a California-based mobile couponing company. The programme allows Kroger customers to use their mobile phones to load coupons from Kimberly-Clark, General Mills, Clorox and others on to their Kroger Plus supermarket loyalty cards.The increased interest in digital coupons in part reflects a frugal mood among US consumers and the maturity of secure technology to handle coupon distribution. But it is also the result of a more fundamental shift in the traditional couponing industry, due to the profound decline of the newspaper business that has been the main vehicle for delivering coupons through “free-standing inserts”.“Our clients are for the first time saying that if venerable print titles are closing they will have to move their promotional budget somewhere else,” says Steven Boal, who founded Coupons Inc, an online coupon service, in 1998.Some clients, he says, are now increasing the share of their direct promotions budget allocated to his online printable coupons to as much as 40 to 50 per cent, from a normal level of 10 to 20 per cent.Laura Keely, director of marketing promotions at Kimberly-Clark, whose brands include Huggies and Kleenex, says changes in the age of the audience that is reading newspapers – and clipping coupons – is a significant factor in her interest in online couponing, such as Kimberly-Clark’s partnership with Cellfire (see side).“What we’re seeing is that younger consumers aren’t buying a Sunday newspaper and clipping those coupons,” she says. “The numbers drop off significantly when you are looking at an 18-24 consumer. If she’s not reading the paper and cutting that coupon, where is she? She’s online.”As the coupon clipper moves on to the web, printable internet coupons appear to be emerging as the dominant strategy for reaching younger consumers, although not all companies are convinced. Procter & Gamble, for instance, says it has opted not to issue printable online coupons because of concerns over potential counterfeiting fraud. Instead, P&G mails coupons to customers who apply online. It is also operating a system for loading coupons on to loyalty cards at both Kroger and its rival Safeway.Mr Boal at Coupons Inc argues that fraud is “no longer an issue” for the retailers, and that his company sees less than 0.05 per cent of the coupons it issues being illegally duplicated. “We think of ourselves as a document security company,” he says, noting that Coupons Inc’s data on each coupon means it can cut off computers that are linked to coupon duplication patterns.In the longer term, there is general agreement in the industry that the mobile phone linked to a digital wallet is likely to emerge as the favoured medium for shoppers to receive and redeem coupons.But Mr Boal at Coupons Inc argues that fully mobile shopping is still five to eight years off. Meanwhile, printing out coupons, rather than storing codes on a mobile phone to show to a cashier, is the most attractive option for a busy supermarket shopper, he says. “Mum doesn’t text a box of cereal to get a coupon. She’s busy stopping her two children pulling things off the shelves.”Matthew Tilley, at the Promotion Marketing Association’s Coupon Council, says that “digital redemption” – which involves customers receiving codes via mobile phones, remains under development. “I believe it will be another year or two before those programmes have any measurable scale to them,” he says.But Brent Dusing, chief executive and founder of Cellfire, argues that mobile coupons will prove too attractive for manufacturers and retailers to ignore.Cellfire’s offers, many of which deliver a bar and text code that needs to be shown to a retailer at the checkout, have redemption rates of 20 to 30 per cent, against a rate of less than one percentage point for newspaper coupon inserts. The system that links the programme to Kroger’s loyalty cards means the coupons are redeemed automatically when the card is scanned, although the system is by definition limited to loyalty card holders.Other companies are also increasingly interested in the intersection of the mobile phone and shopping. Kraft, the largest US food company, launched an iPhone application this year that includes menus and a shopping list facility. In January, Coupons Inc also acquired a popular iPhone application, GroceryiQ, designed for drawing up grocery lists – which it may eventually be able to match to money-off coupons.Coupons Inc has also formed a venture with Yahoo to develop a system for distributing coupons to mobile phones. Mr Boal argues this is better suited for distribution of coupons for single-trip transactions, such as restaurants, entertainment and services such as dry cleaning.“There is a lot of talk about the moment of truth, about why consumers choose brand X rather than brand Y,” says Mr Dusing at Cellfire. “The power to actually influence a purchasing decision is inside a store, and it is only the mobile device that is able to do that…suddenly you can message offers to people based on where they are.”
93;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2009-02-04T20:55:57Z;US company earnings hit by FX turbulence;;US companies increasingly cite currency fluctuations among the reasons for slumping sales and profits as volatile foreign exchange markets hit corporate America with fourth-quarter earnings season in full swing.In recent years, US businesses have become steadily more exposed to foreign exchange risk as they draw more business from beyond America.Standard & Poor’s estimates that companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index made almost 50 per cent of their sales outside the US by the end of 2007, up from 30 per cent in 2001.The list of companies that have reported the pinch of currency risk in recent weeks is long and distinguished.Procter & Gamble, often thought of as a recession-resistant company, cut its full-year profit forecast last week as unfavourable foreign exchange movements reduced net sales by 5 per cent and the dollar appreciated versus the euro, sterling and Canadian dollar.Mattel’s fourth-quarter net sales were down 11 per cent from last year and included an unfavourable impact from changes in currency exchange rates of 5 percentage points.At Starbucks, international total net revenues fell 8 per cent compared with the same period last year, primarily as a result of the stronger dollar relative to sterling and the Canadian dollar.McDonald’s, Kimberly-Clark and Wal-Mart also lowered earnings guidance in December because of currency fluctuations.As a result of this greater impact of currency swings, companies are starting to put greater emphasis on trying to hedge their foreign exchange exposure, according to a recent survey from JPMorgan.US companies estimated that 42 per cent of their forecast foreign income was hedged in December, up from less than 7 per cent in April, the survey of clients found.A variety of instruments, including simple forward contracts, are used to hedge currency risk. Other instruments are futures, options and collars – a protective options strategy.The JPMorgan survey also estimated that G7 currencies would fluctuate by an annualised 20 per cent this quarter, double the average since 2000, emphasising the growing need to hedge against potentially adverse currency movements.However, even those that have actively hedged in the past may have been caught out recently. “There have always been active hedgers and most companies have at least had an awareness of this,” said George Nunn, head of foreign exchange and rates structuring for the Americas at BNP Paribas.“In terms of risk management, the typical process is for companies to estimate future revenues and decide on the basis of that estimate how much they will hedge.”Because the recession meant that, in most cases, revenues had been over­estimated, Mr Nunn said, many companies found that they were overhedged “and so are being forced to unwind trades”.The process of corporate deleveraging was still not over, he said, and unwinding some of the overhedging was part of that process.“Company earnings are clearly going to get hurt as a result of this alongside other factors,” Mr Nunn added.Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall in New York
94;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;US consumers seeking value options;;The frugal mood of the US consumer was underlined on Monday by quarterly results from McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, and Kimberly-Clark, maker of leading household brands including Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues.McDonald’s said that comparable sales at its low-cost US restaurants increased by 5 per cent during its fourth quarter, maintaining steady growth as other more upmarket rivals, from Starbucks to Denny’s, have been reporting consistently falling sales.In contrast, Kimberly-Clark reported a 10 per cent decline in sales of its leading Huggies nappies in North America, as well as in sales of its Viva and Scott paper towels.Its leading bathroom paper brands saw a 7 per cent fall in volumes, while Kleenex sales dropped 3 per cent.The company said the impact of the economic slowdown on its business had been “more anticipated”, with customers in the US and Europe choosing not to restock household supplies, and trading down to lower-cost alternative brands.Tom Falk, chief executive, said the company was looking at ways to lower prices on nappies and training pants, where it faces intense competition from store brand rivals.Kimberly-Clark’s overall sales fell 3.4 per cent to $4.6bn, in spite of price increases due to higher commodity costs, as the strength of the dollar added to pressure from falling sales volumes. Earnings dropped by 8.1 per cent to $419m, or $1.01 per diluted share.The strength of the dollar also hit McDonald’s net sales, which fell 3 per cent against a year ago to $5.56bn.Globally, McDonald’s saw comparable sales increase by 7.2 per cent, with a 7.6 per cent rise in Europe and 10 per cent in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa division.Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive, said “today’s market conditions play to our strengths” and highlighted growth in Europe in the UK, France and Russia.“Our model remains recession resistant,” Mr Skinner said.
95;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2008-12-02T15:58:32Z;Did IT work: A faster route to full trucks and lower costs;;"Transport costs often account for a surprisingly high percentage of the price of everyday items.Take toilet paper, for example, or nappies, or kitchen roll: as much as 10 per cent of the price is the cost of delivering the product to a place where the customer can buy it.This was the case for Kimberly Clark, manufacturer of brands such as Huggies and Andrex. So the company turned to IT to reduce distribution costs.“The total logistics cost is more than 10 per cent of our net sales value, and that is a significant line item on the profit and loss account,” says Peter Surtees, director for the European consumer supply chain at Kimberly Clark. “Freight costs, as a proportion of that 10 per cent, are a significant amount.”Cutting freight costs, then, would immediately contribute to the company’s bottom line. But there was another objective: to reduce the company’s CO2 emissions. More efficient transport planning, in particular, reduces costs, fuel consumption and CO2.Unlike some of its competitors, Kimberly Clark manages its logistics operations in-house – although it contracts out the actual shipments to third-party hauliers. To run this, the company used a hosted transport management system, or TMS. The system’s owner charged Kimberly Clark a variable fee, based on the number of jobs booked through the software.“It didn’t necessarily have the functionality we needed, and didn’t allow us to reduce our costs,” Mr Surtees says. “So we needed to find another one.”The company carried out a benchmarking exercise with three transport management systems and chose software from i2, a supply chain company. Two parallel projects were then set up to install the new application, one for Europe and one for North America.Kimberly Clark based its software choice on functionality and ease of implementation, Mr Surtees recalls.Although the company’s main enterprise resource planning vendor, SAP, also has a transport management system, it was not as sophisticated in Mr Surtees’ view, and Kimberly Clark could not wait for it to catch up.Once they had decided on i2, the team at Kimberly Clark opted for a three-month design phase, in which the company would establish how to make the most of the new tool and organise integration with SAP, and then a phased implementation across Europe with a timetable of 12 months.The new system is not large, by the standards of a company such as Kimberly Clark, but it is significant for the business nonetheless. Between 50 and 60 people, mostly logistics specialists as well as some business analysts, use i2 on a daily basis. The system is expected to save about $2m a year.The first $1m of savings, Mr Surtees points out, came from fees the company no longer had to pay for its hosted TMS. The second $1m – in projected annualised savings – comes from reduced freight costs.Kimberly Clark implemented its transport management system in a reasonably standard way.The company maintains a list of hauliers, ranked by their cost for each route. This ensures that when an order comes in from the SAP system, it is offered first to the cheapest carrier.“With automation, that is much slicker,” says Mr Surtees. “It will always pick the lowest-cost provider and then work along the list, if the lowest cost doesn’t have capacity.”But because the new system is more flexible, it allows Kimberly Clark to use more carriers – about 170 in all – and to optimise its freight traffic.Using more hauliers allows Kimberly Clark to pick smaller companies that might be more competitive on particular routes.It also allows the manufacturer’s logistics planners to identify more haulage companies that might be running “empty legs”. Finding empty trucks – and filling them with freight – is one of the quickest ways in the logistics business to cut both costs and carbon emissions.Mr Surtees explains: “If there is no empty running we and the carrier both benefit, as we are partially funding that running.”Smaller niche carriers, the company found, are more likely to have empty legs than the larger hauliers.Data in the system also allow the Kimberly Clark team to identify when a haulier has a vehicle heading close to one of the company’s plants; often that vehicle can pick up a load, rather than the company ordering a separate truck.There are, though, some other restrictions that both the software, and the freight planning team, need to take into account.One is the reputation of the haulier. Supermarkets, in particular, need trucks and drivers to be presentable. Another issue is ensuring that the right vehicles are available for jobs.Shipments of goods such as nappies or toilet paper “cube out” – or fill the vehicle’s cubic capacity – before they reach the truck’s weight limit. Haulier data need to be accurate, to ensure they have high cubic capacity trucks available.In contrast, ensuring that Kimberly Clark’s carbon footprint falls is relatively straightforward: cutting the number of miles travelled on the company’s behalf immediately reduces emissions.“One gallon of diesel produces 12kg of CO2,” says Mr Surtees. “The average truck does 8.5 miles per gallon, so for every mile you take off you save 1.4 to 1.5kg of CO2. Carbon and cost are inextricably linked. So our $1m saving equates to about 380,000 truck miles, or about 540,000kg of CO2.”"
96;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2008-10-29T17:32:40Z;Forex volatility could lead to P&G price rises;;"Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods company, said on Wednesday it was facing “unprecedented” foreign exchange volatility in emerging markets and would have to respond with further price increases.Clayt Daley, chief financial officer, said “the devaluation across the emerging markets we are witnessing is unprecedented in its depth, breadth and speed,” citing recent steep falls in the value of currencies such as the Russian rouble and the Mexican peso.He said that, while P&G would seek to offset increased dollar-based input costs in its global markets with local price increases, it would also have to absorb the translation impact on its overseas earnings in its top line.P&G revised its outlook for full year earnings per share to a range of $4.15 to $4.25, versus an earlier forecast of $4.18 to $4.25.International sales account for almost two thirds of P&G’s revenue. Last week, its rival Kimberly-Clark also said the current environment was pushing it to take a more nimble and flexible approach to pricing in overseas markets, citing unprecedented volatility.While oil prices have fallen, P&G said it was still facing high prices for commodities such as potash and sodium sulphate.AG Lafley, chief executive, noted that while overall commodity costs for the year were expected to increase by $300m less than forecast “we’re still looking at the toughest year in this company’s history, with $2.7bn in commodity and energy costs that we have to eat”.“We still have a pretty tough commodity picture out there,” he added.During the first quarter, the company said organic sales – excluding acquisitions – rose 5 per cent, in the middle of its long-term target of 4 to 6 per cent growth. It said it was still expecting organic growth in the same range over the remainder of its year.During the quarter, P&G said it had lost some market share in the US as a result
of increasing prices on major brands. But Mr Daley said the company expected to pull back market share as competitors were obliged to follow the price increases.P&G’s lower-cost brands, such as Gain laundry detergent and Luvs nappies, grew more strongly during the quarter than premium brands. Luvs, for instance, saw sales volumes grow by 7 per cent and gained market share.Mr Lafley said the company was responding to slowing consumer demand in the US with an increased marketing focus on the comparative performance value of its top products.In the first quarter, net sales increased 9 per cent to $22bn. Earnings also rose 9 per cent to $3.3bn, while diluted earnings per share were up 12 per cent at $1.03."
97;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2008-10-21T19:58:26Z;Wal-Mart seeks green in China;;In the Darwinian struggle for global manufacturing orders, the “Wal-Mart price” has generally been short-hand for shaving production costs to the bare minimum.But on Wednesday in Beijing, Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, will tell hundreds of the company’s top Chinese suppliers that the retailer intends to use its market power to get more than just low prices – at a “sustainability summit” devoted to raising standards in its vast supply chain.Attending the gathering will be AG Lafley, chief executive of Procter & Gamble, Fred Smith, head of FedEx, and Yuanqing Yang, chairman of Lenovo, who are keen to adopt a similar approach. Executives from Kimberly-Clark, Coca-Cola and Newell Rubbermaid will also be on hand for the most ambitious private sector drive yet to reduce waste and pollution in China’s export-focused manufacturing industries.Mr Scott will set out a range of objectives for the company’s supply chain and for its Chinese retail operations, which will include targets for the reduction of water and energy usage, reductions in packaging, and commitments to develop more sustainable products.“Our environmental footprint is primarily through our supply chain as a company,” says Matt Kistler, head of Wal-Mart’s global sustainability efforts. “So we have the ability to really build a world-class, better quality, better value supply chain.”In the US alone, Wal-Mart is estimated to sell about $30bn of goods annually that are made by about 30,000 factories in China, or about 10 per cent of all US imports. In categories such as clothing, footwear and toys – worth $64bn last year – Wal-Mart’s share is far higher.The retailer will also be promoting a new “Green Supply Chain Initiative” being led by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a non-profit group that has worked with Wal-Mart on sustainability issues in the US. The project is aimed at working with individual suppliers on energy saving and other issues, and is expected to extend to other US and European retailers, covering another 20,000 factories.“We will leverage the market clout of global retailers to help create a green playing field for China’s exporters,” says EDF.In the US the retailer has embraced a series of environmental initiatives over the past three years, including developing solar power systems and promoting more sustainable products such as low-enegy light bulbs. This year, it introduced a packaging scorecard that evaluates the efforts of suppliers to reduce packaging waste, which is now being translated into Mandarin.Jennifer Turner, head of the China Environment Forum at the Wilson Center in Washington, says that in China similar pressure from international companies could help counter the problems of enforcement that continue to dog central government efforts to enforce existing environmental laws.“Local governments are not interested in enforcing laws, sometimes because they own the factories …I think this initiative from international companies to be crucial because it is a new kind of pressure on local government,” says Ms Turner. But the initiative also represents a shift in Wal-Mart’s traditional focus on securing the lowest possible price, which has helped shape the current supply chain and is blamed by critics for its social and environmental shortcomings.Mr Scott told Wal-Mart managers at their annual meeting in Kansas City this year that “we will favour – and in some cases even pay more – for suppliers that meet our standards”.However, Conrad ­MacKerron, head of supply chain programme at As You Sow, which co-ordinates pressure on companies from ethical investors, questions how the new approach would work in a world where brands and retailers have played suppliers off against each other on price.“If you go to a supplier that is already feeling the squeeze financially, and you say that they need to reduce energy and stop waste water, how do they do that given that Wal-Mart’s business model is basically to pay less year after year?”The focus on raising environmental standards in China’s supply chain comes against the background of broader concerns over regulation of factories there, with a new scandal over the contamination of Chinese milk-products with melamine. Last year saw a crisis over the safety of Chinese-made toys, which was preceded by a massive pet-food recall in the US because of melamine contamination of Chinese made ingredients.Ed Chan, head of Wal-Mart China, says the central government is giving the initiative “very active support”. “Sustainability is a top priority, and they have been encouraging Chinese and multi-national companies to really rethink the business model.”Jeff Macho, the China-based head of Wal-Mart’s global procurement division, insists the company wants to view its supply chain “holistically”, including both environmental and social factors such as labour conditions with product quality. He also said that in keeping with Mr Scott’s professed readiness to pay more the company had recently moved a home fashion contract to a more expensive supplier because of concerns over standards at the original factory.“I would say we are seeing an evolution to a new business model,” he says. “I think we are developing that relationship with suppliers, to look not only at price, but at all of these other elements.”
98;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2008-10-08T15:12:16Z;Transport: Finding better ways to deliver the goods;;"Increased transport costs because of oil price rises can change the economics on which supply chains were built.Traditional strategies were aimed at reducing the amount of money tied up in inventory and the number of warehouses. However, this was often at the expense of increased transport frequencies and distances, and therefore emissions.Strategies, such as just-in-time, lean manufacturing and even low-cost country sourcing, must be re-evaluated in light of fuel prices. We have entered a new era where different supply chain strategies are needed to engender high performance, says Past the Tipping Point, a recent report from Accenture and Ilog, the French-headquartered business software company.Jonathan Wright, global head of the fulfilment practice at Accenture, explains that tipping point analysis is an end-to-end assessment of the supply chain to understand at what point inventory should be held further forward in the supply chain to reduce transport costs.Moving inventory closer to demand lowers transport and emissions at the expense of higher inventory costs.“That tipping point occurs at different fuel prices, depending on the type and nature of the product,” he says. “The tipping point will lower with a low-cost bulky product, such as soft drinks or paper. There will always be areas where just-in-time is the right thing to do and others where it is history.”Kimberly-Clark’s “Network of the Future” places distribution centres closer to its key customers and markets, reducing the number of delivery trips. Its strategy aims for 70 per cent of product to be made and sold in the same country. In the US alone in 2007, it saved nearly 2.8m miles and 500,000 gallons of fuel.There is a carbon trade-off between more energy efficient centralised warehouses and transport costs, but, generally, cost and carbon reduction are aligned.Professor Alan McKinnon, director of the Logistics Research Centre at Scotland’s Heriot-Watt University, has identified nine ways of reducing carbon in freight transport, most of which will also reduce costs.These are: switch from road and air to rail or water; reduce the number of links in supply chains; reduce average journey length; increase average vehicle loading; reduce empty running; increase vehicle capacity; reschedule deliveries to off-peak periods; fuel efficiency; and use lower carbon fuels.Sharing distribution centres and deliveries is a powerful way to reduce cost and carbon footprint.Judy Blackburn, head of the UK logistics team at Kurt Salmon Associates, a consultancy, says that when two competing companies have merged their logistics operations and vehicle deliveries, transport costs have fallen by 15-25 per cent, saving 300,000-400,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide.“Current supply chain designs are primarily aimed at improving on-shelf availability, reducing cost and supporting sound financial figures,” according to The 2016 Future Supply Chain: Serving Consumers in a Sustainable Way, a report by the Global Commerce Initiative of manufacturers and retailers and Capgemini, the consultant.“In future, the industry must design for additional parameters, such as CO2 emissions reduction, reduced energy consumption, better traceability and reduced traffic congestion.”The report envisages that finished products will be shipped to collaborative warehouses in which multiple manufacturers store their products. Shared transport will deliver to city hubs and regional consolidation centres. Final distribution to stores, pick-up points and homes will use consolidated deliveries.This is already happening, through the Sustainable Distribution initiative to share vehicles and through third-party logistics providers. For example, Wincanton runs a “white fleet” of unbranded vehicles on behalf of three major clients.The Meadowhall Shopping Centre’s consolidation centre outside Sheffield, operated by Clipper, receives 17 deliveries a day, which are consolidated to six deliveries to the shopping centre. Last Christmas, 37 deliveries a day were consolidated on to 10 trucks.Mr Wright warns that although supply chain collaboration is a big opportunity, there are challenges. Planning is hard enough internally, but even harder when companies plan in different ways.Two-thirds of the freight tonnage moved in the UK goes by road, with most of the cost borne by truck operators and passed on to customers. Prof McKinnon points out that some of the wider environmental and congestion costs are imposed on the community at large.“Not many companies will act unilaterally and voluntarily to become greener if it is going to increase their costs and reduce their competitiveness,” he says. A rare example is Jaguar Land Rover.High fuel prices are doing the work of carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes, which were intended to “internalise” the environmental costs.Prof McKinnon points out that the current cost of a tonne of carbon emissions in a trading scheme is about €25 ($44), whereas the average fuel duty imposed is about €290. He also points out that tightening European emission standards have caused a huge reduction in emissions, independently of fuel prices.“We haven’t been very smart in the past, so there is a lot we can do to reduce transport intensity of anything that we move using current technology,” concludes Martin Christopher, chairman of the Cranfield Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management.“The steep rise in the price of oil means that for the first time people are taking this issue seriously,” says Mr Christopher. “The long-term trend is that oil prices will go up and up, so we must revisit our whole supply chain strategy.”……………………………………………………………………………………………………….Vehicle sharing – an idea that carries weight in the cause of sustainabilityA group of 37 of the UK’s leading food and consumer goods companies recently made a little noticed move to pool some of their delivery operations. Instead of delivering with part-filled trucks or returning empty, they have started to share vehicles on certain routes.“Getting people to share transport sounds easy on the surface, but in practice it is not,” says Tarun Patel, head of supply chain at IGD. “Our role is to help businesses to understand why and how they can collaborate.”Formed in 1909 as the Institute of Grocery Distribution, IGD is a not-for-profit organisation whose aim is to make the food and grocery industry more efficient and effective, through research and training. It has had an efficient consumer response programme in place for 12 years, looking at all supply chain issues. Three years ago, it identified collaborative distribution as an opportunity. The price of fuel had been going up, and all projections showed further rises, and organisations wanted to become more sustainable.According to the UK Department for Transport, in 2007 “empty running” for all vehicles was 27.4 per cent of the available capacity, representing part-filled deliveries and empty return journeys. IGD’s Sustainable Distribution initiative has set a voluntary target to remove 48m miles from 2007/8, saving of 61,500 tonnes of CO2.IGD ran workshops, affectionately known as “speed dating for truckers”, to explain to members a seven-step process to achieve collaboration.This is to produce a matrix of routes and volumes; identify collaborative routes; agree rates; agree key performance indicators and a review mechanism; agree and run a trial; review it; and roll out a full solution.“When we started to run trials, we found that problems were partly cultural,” says Mr Patel. “Organisations have different attitudes towards customer service, costs, sharing vehicles and vehicle branding. We had to break through that in the past two years by pointing out the size of the prize and getting chief executives to push it down through their organisations.”There have also been physical problems, such as manufacturers preferring side loading trucks and retailers rear-loading, and insurance issues to be addressed.However, early trials have delivered tangible results. At a workshop, Nestlé discovered that United Biscuits was running empty trucks from close to its factories in the north back to the Midlands. Returning United Biscuits trucks now collect a full load of Nestlé products each day from factories in York and Halifax and deliver them to the Midlands.“With other initiatives, the Sustainable Distribution programme has delivered a 6 per cent annual improvement in our vehicle utilisation,” says Chris Tyas, supply chain director at Nestlé.Returning Tesco vehicles pass through Unilever’s Doncaster distribution centre to collect health and beauty products previously delivered direct to Tesco’s Goole distribution centre, helping to take 500,000 miles off the road.Sainsbury’s trucks returning to East Kilbride now collect Walkers crisps and snacks from Peterlee, saving more than 100,000 miles a year.Chep, the leading UK provider of pooled pallets, sends vehicles to Asda’s distribution sites to pick up left-over empty pallets and redistribute them for use among other customers. Collaboration on certain legs of the journey has led the two companies to save more than 500,000 miles a year.Other participating companies include Booker, Boots, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Co-operative Group, Dairy Crest, HJ Heinz, Iceland Foods, Johnson & Johnson, Kellogg’s, Kimberly-Clark, Kraft Foods, Marks and Spencer, Mars, Wm Morrison, Northern Foods, Premier Foods, Procter & Gamble, Somerfield, Unilever and Waitrose.“Food distribution is extremely visible to the consumer and with excess capacity on the roads, the size of the prize is immense,” says Mr Patel. “We are delivering significant improvements against a voluntary target, but we are at the tip of the iceberg,” says Mr Patel. “We need to get the whole industry, including smaller companies, on board. The overwhelming belief of our members is that in 10 years time most companies will be using collaborative distribution.”"
99;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2008-10-08T15:12:16Z;Energy efficiency: Save energy – the less painful way to cut costs;;In a downturn, companies start to look urgently for ways to trim their costs.Typically, this will include redundancies and the closure of some underperforming units. Managers will be told to do more with less, and corporate belt-tightening may include cutting down on expenses such as entertaining or non-essential travel.But could companies achieve some of the same results through energy efficiency?Soaring energy prices have meant that energy is a much bigger part of any company’s overheads than it used to be – the spend on energy has more than doubled in the past three or four years for many companies. So cutting out the wasteful use of energy should bring savings which – importantly – are much less painful than cutting staff or closing offices.Hugh Jones, director of solutions at the Carbon Trust, a UK government-funded body, says most companies can shave about 20 per cent from their energy bills without trying very hard.“A lot of these things are very simple, like turning off lights in rooms where people aren’t working,” he says.InterfaceFlor, for instance, a manufacturer of carpet tiles, has pledged to have a zero carbon footprint by 2020, and in its effort to do so has cut its energy consumption by 45 per cent per unit of output. This, together with other waste-reduction measures, has saved the company more than $372m since the mid-1990s.Eon, the energy utility, estimates that the average office wastes £6,000 ($10,453) a year because employees fail to take basic energy efficiency measures, which can be as easy as turning off computers when they go home and unplugging mobile phone chargers when not in use.The company found that some of the barriers to employees being more energy-efficient were surprising.Just over half the people it surveyed said they were held back by being afraid to ask permission, while a similar number said that the lack of a financial incentive was to blame.A quarter said they did not take energy-efficiency measures because of worries about being ridiculed by colleagues if they did so.However, companies are becoming much more aware of energy efficiency, owing to a combination of high prices and economic concerns, reports John Murphy, vice-president and managing director for systems and services for Europe and Africa at Johnson Controls, which makes building control products.“We are seeing much more interest in energy efficiency across the board. There will be much greater sensitivity [to energy-efficiency issues] from building owners, as the credit crunch continues to bite,” he says.Some energy-efficiency measures – such as turning off computers or opening windows rather than turning on air conditioning – are straightforward and save money immediately, while requiring little more than minor behavioural changes to implement.Others, however, are more difficult and require investment. For instance, “building automation” improvements, such as installing sensors to turn off lights when there is no movement or winding down the heating of offices at night, can substantially cut energy wastage. But the costs of buying and installing such equipment mean the payback period may be one or two years, says Mr Murphy. This is often what makes companies hesitate.Harry Verhaar, senior director for energy and climate change at Philips Lighting, says lighting represents 19 per cent of global energy use but more than three-quarters of lights are of the older, less efficient type. If they were replaced by efficient lights, about 40 per cent of this energy use could be eliminated, resulting in savings of more than €100bn ($135bn) a year worldwide.The savings would be equivalent to the output of about 530 average-sized power plants, resulting in huge cuts in carbon dioxide emissions.But although energy-efficient lightbulbs save money over a few years, they are more expensive to buy than the older models.Mark Nutt, managing consultant at Morse, the consulting and IT services company, says chief executives can encourage their managers to find efficiencies by making each department responsible for its own energy use.“By making departments pay for their own energy, managers will be incentivised to monitor usage and find areas where it can be reduced,” he explains. “The greatest initial savings can be achieved with relatively simple measures rather than out-and-out reinvention.”It is not just energy that is wasted. Cutting down on the waste of raw materials can result in substantial savings for manufacturers, says Bill McCausland, production specialist at Envirowise, a UK government-funded agency helping companies reduce their environmental impact.“With continued pressure on manufacturers to manage the impact of higher raw material costs, taking a systematic approach to resource efficiency can provide manufacturers with a sustainable strategy of cost reduction in a competitive market,” he says.Kimberly-Clark, for example, found it could cut costs by redesigning its toilet tissue, Andrex. The company put 50 per cent more sheets on each roll and trimmed 30mm of packaging from its packs, saving about 83,000kg of plastic a year and cutting transport costs.Encouraging companies to realise these cost savings can still be difficult, however, as it requires management time and effort that is in short supply, as companies look to their survival.Mr Murphy argues that governments should play more of a role: “I think things such as investment tax credits for building improvements that increase energy efficiency would really help get more companies looking at this issue.”
100;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2008-10-01T04:36:35Z;Low sales spread globally for Pepsi bottler;;Pepsi Bottling Group, the largest global bottler of Pepsi-Cola drinks, said on Tuesday it was seeing signs that the slowdown in the US was spreading to its global customers.Eric Foss, chief executive officer, said that soft consumer demand in the US had spread during the third quarter “across geographies” leading to sales volume declines in Europe and Mexico.In Europe, total volume of cases sold fell 6 per cent. He cited economic factors ranging from economic volatility and the impact of food inflation in Russia, to the effects of the housing slump in Spain. In Mexico, where case volumes were down 9 per cent, he noted that cash remittances from the US had fallen to their lowest level in over a decade, leading to declines in consumer confidence.PBG said the total volume of cases it sold during its third quarter fell 6 per cent in the US and Canada.Just over 30 per cent of PBG’s $14bn annual revenues come from its international business in Europe and Mexico, which accounts for around 40 per cent of PepsiCo’s global drinks business.Over the past year, strong intenational sales have helped to offset the increasingly sluggish US performance of consumer goods companies, ranging from Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark.Over the summer, the larger US food companies reported continued strength in their international operations during their second quarters, with General Mills saying it was expecting “continued strong top line growth”, and Kraft citing “good organic growth”.In the US, where PBG handles more than half of PepsiCo’s business, it noted that sales of both bottled Aquafina water and non-carbonated drinks and Tropicana juices had been harder hit by slowing demand than its traditional carbonated drinks such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew.Mr Foss argued that the non-carbonated drinks were largely dependent on single serving sales in stores and “were probably a little more prone to be more impacted by difficult economic conditions that prevail right now”.Water sales volume was down 6 per cent during the quarter in the US, exceeding the overall 2 per cent decline for the category, which PBG attributed in part to its decision to avoid chasing competitor’s price cuts to support sales.Its non-carbonated drinks volumes fell 2 per cent, against an overall 3 per cent decline in the category. Carbonated drinks sales fell four per cent, in line with forecasts.PepsiCo reported net income for the third quarter of $231 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, on revenues of $3.8bn.
101;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2008-09-03T21:36:35Z;Montagu puts BSN Medical up for auction;;BSN Medical, the German bandages maker, has been put up for sale by Montagu, its UK-based private equity owner, which expects the planned €1.8bn-€1.9bn ($2.6bn-$2.8bn) auction to generate its biggest return for investors.The sale would be the latest in a string of deals in the wound-care industry this year, after Bristol-Myers Squibb sold its ConvaTec business to private equity for $4.1bn and Johnson & Johnson received a bid for its Ethicon wound-care unit.Healthcare is attractive to private equity as it is a rare part of the economy expected to be relatively immune to any downturn as it benefits from the demographic pressures of ageing populations and the spread of improved medical technology.Hamburg-based BSN, created in 2001 as a joint venture between Smith & Nephew and Beiersdorf, is one of the most valuable assets in Montagu’s portfolio. The buy-out group, spun out of HSBC five years ago, acquired it for €1.03bn in 2005.There is likely to be stiff competition between strategic buyers, such as 3M and Kimberly Clarke, and private equity groups with strong healthcare teams, such as Apax Partners and Bain Capital, in the auction of BSN.The company, which Montagu has built up with a series of add-on acquisitions, increased revenues by about 4.5 per cent to €560m last year. It has operations in Germany, France, the UK, Pakistan, Mexico, South Africa and the US, employing 3,600 staff.Its products include casts for fracture management, supports and strapping for physiotherapy, bandages and dressings for wound care, and hosiery for compression therapy.The sale would return a large part of Montagu’s most recent €2.26bn fund, which is already about half invested. The buy-out group has offices in London, Manchester, Paris, Düsseldorf and Stockholm and has been run by Chris Masterson for eight years.Financing is likely to be available for private equity buyers, in spite of the turmoil in debt markets caused by the credit crunch. Some $3bn of loans for the buy-out of ConvaTec by Nordic Capital and Avista were successfully sold on to investors in July.Other private equity groups expected to be interested in the auction of BSN are Cinven, Advent International, Warburg Pincus, Blackstone, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, CVC Capital Partners and EQT.Montagu received a number of unsolicited approaches for the company, prompting it to appoint Morgan Stanley to conduct a strategic review earlier this year.Other strategic groups that could be interested in the sale of BSN include Cardinal Health, Medline and Sweden’s Mölnlycke Health Care Group.
102;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2008-08-07T21:06:44Z;Wall Street stocks fall on AIG losses;;US stocks fell back for the first time in three sessions on Thursday as further losses at AIG hurt the financial sector and Wal-Mart posted disappointing July sales figures.AIG, the insurer hit by massive subprime losses, slumped as much as 19.1 per cent, its biggest one-day drop in 39 years, after posting a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss of $5.4bn. By the close, the stock was down 18.1 per cent to $23.84.Analysts at Barclays Capital said: “Although we would be surprised to see large writedowns of the same magnitude over the next two quarters, we believe that the risk of additional impairment remains, adding to investor concerns about capital deficiency. In addition, we believe that further downgrades could be on the cards.”Meanwhile, Citigroup said it would buy back more than $7bn worth of auction rate securities and take a $100m fine as part of an agreement to settle claims that it mis-sold the instruments to clients. Citigroup lost 4.3 per cent to $18.85.The sell-off in financials gathered pace in mid-afternoon after Moody’s Investors Service said it may downgrade American Express’s debt rating and the sector closed down 5 per cent.JPMorgan Chase slipped 3.8 per cent to $39.81, Bank of America dipped 5.8 per cent to $31.52 and American Express slid 4.2 per cent to $36.40.Consumer-facing stocks faced headwinds from volatile oil prices and some poor sales data from retailers.Wal-Mart said same-store sales grew less than expected last month and forecast slower sales growth in August, which suggested that the temporary fillip from tax rebates was beginning to fade.The shares slid 6.3 per cent, the most in six years, to $56.96 on that bleak prospect.Meanwhile, Whole Foods and Kimberly-Clark dipped 5.9 per cent to $18.88 and 3.5 per cent to $58.48 respectively.That overshadowed better-than-expected July sales for Costco Wholesale and an improved outlook from JC Penney. Costco shares rose 0.2 per cent to $65.82 while JC Penney added 6.1 per cent to $33.53.The consumer discretionary sector fell 2 per cent as Target and Abercrombie & Fitch dropped 4.7 per cent to $45.76 and 10.6 per cent to $49.80 respectively after they posted disappointing same store sales in July.Markets took another leg down after the release of the latest batch of numbers on employment.The number of Americans making first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose 7,000 to 455,000 from 448,000 a week earlier. That is the highest level in six years.All 10 leading industry groups closed in the red, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 index down 1.8 per cent to 1,266.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.9 per cent to 11,431.43 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,355.73On Wednesday stocks climbed to their highest levels since the end of June, shrugging off morning worries about wider-than-expected losses at Freddie Mac as oil prices dropped and positive results buoyed the technology sector.So far this earnings season, more than 400 S&P 500 companies have reported results and, on average, profit has declined by about 21 per cent.Information technology companies have posted some of the best performances. Their profits have grown by an average of 18 per cent this quarter.On Thursday, Teradata led the sector higher. The data storage software provider reported second-quarter profits that beat analysts’ estimates and its shares rose 6.6 per cent to $24.40.The sector was among the best performers, giving up only 0.1 per cent.Semiconductor stocks also made ground after Citigroup analysts suggested Intel was on course to meet “aggressive” third-quarter revenue growth targets thanks to the popularity of its Atom chip.Intel climbed 3.8 per cent to $23.67, Advanced Micro Devices rose 4.8 per cent to $5.03 while SanDisk added 6.1 per cent to $16.17.Markets also took a measure of solace from the most recent housing data, which showed an unexpected bounce in pending home sales, although homebuilder stocks themselves were largely unmoved.
103;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;P&G passes high costs to emerging markets;;Procter & Gamble admitted on Tuesday that it was being forced to pass on an “unprecendented” level of price increases to its customers in emerging markets as a result of high commodity costs.The company, which is also increasing prices in its developed markets, was waiting to see what impact, if any, the rises would have on demand in emerging markets that delivered organic sales growth of more than 10 per cent, or more than double the overall target.AG Lafley, the chief executive, said: “We are looking at the largest increase in commodity and energy prices that any of us …have seen …including the 1970s.”However, the world’s largest consumer products company met its long-term sales and earnings growth targets in its fourth quarter results reported on Tuesday in spite of the commodity price rises and a sluggish US economy.Net sales rose 10 per cent in the fourth quarter to $21.3bn (€13.8bn), while organic sales, excluding the impact of acquisitions, diverstitures and foreign exchange, met targets by rising 5 per cent.Net earnings were up 33 per cent for the quarter to $3bn and P&G delivered 37 per cent increased earnings per diluted share to 92 cents.P&G forecast that it would face an additional $3bn in commodity cost increases in its new fiscal year, which it would offset by price rises and continuing efforts to cut overheads.During the fiscal year ending July 1, it said its gross margins fell by 70 basis points to 51.3 per cent, with commodity costs accounting for 200bp of negative pressure.In the US, P&G said it was continuing to see some evidence of customers “trading down”, often to its own lower-price brands rather than private-label rivals.P&G’s handling of commodity costs contrasts with that of Kimberly-Clark, its leading rival in paper and baby care products.Last month, Kimberly-Clark missed financial targets after it said the speed of commodity price rises had outpaced its ability to pass them to consumers.The largest advertiser in the world said advertising in the past year had been in line with its traditional levels, at 10.4 per cent of total sales.Clayt Daley, chief financial officer, said: “Cutting advertising is not part of our plan to cut costs.”P&G was up 2.6 per cent in mid-afternoon trade in New York.
104;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2008-07-16T02:30:27Z;Kimberly-Clark warns of price increases;;Kimberly-Clark warned on Tuesday that it would have to make a series of price increases over the coming months before it could offset what it called “unprecedented” increases in its costs of oil, natural gas and wood pulp.Tom Falk, chief executive, told analysts and investors on Tuesday that “the cost environment had changed rapidly and dramatically”, and that the company’s initial estimates of cost inflation for the year had been “way off base”.The company, maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, said after the close of US trading on Monday that it had now more than doubled its estimate for cost inflation for the current year from $400m to up to $900m, as it announced preliminary second quarter results that fell short of its original forecast and cut its earnings guidance.Mr Falk said the speed of the increases, such as the 50 per cent increase in the costs of oil and gas since the beginning of the year, had overtaken Kimberly-Clark’s ability to respond with consumer price increases.The company is already planning its second price increase of the year for its consumer brands in the US, and in other markets, which would lead to an average increase in prices of about 3 per cent for the year, against the 1 to 2 per cent originally envisaged.However, Mr Falk said the price increases currently planned would still be insufficient to offset current cost inflation.“Unfortunately it will take some time, and potentially further price increases, to offset the recent escalation in input costs,” he said.Kimberly-Clark said it was cutting its forecast earnings for the year to the range of $4.20-$4.30, down from $4.45-$4.60. Its shares fell more than 4 per cent to $56 on Tuesday.Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark’s larger rival, reaffirmed its forecast earnings for its April to June quarter, saying that it expected sales growth for the quarter of 8 to 10 per cent, and diluted earnings per share of $0.76 to $0.78.Colgate-Palmolive also said it expected “to meet or exceed” Wall Street’s earnings expectations for the same period.Mr Falk said US consumer demand for Kimberly-Clark’s brands remained largely stable, in spite of some softness in the household paper towels market, and some evidence of slight increases in private-label share of baby wipes and tissues.
105;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2008-07-15T20:49:28Z;Wall Street dominated by volatile trading;;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below 11,000 for the first time since February 2006 on Tuesday as fears about the financial sector, a dramatic fall in oil prices and news that the SEC planned to limit short-selling played against one another.The volatile day began in typically gloomy fashion with financials under particular pressure after a number of analyst downgrades, a banking-led sell-off in European and Asian markets and some poor results.Meredith Whitney, an analyst at Oppenheimer, downgraded Wachovia from “perform” to “underperform” slashing her full year 2008 and 2009 estimates and warned that the outlook for equity shareholders was “bleak”.Analysts at Barclays Capital said: “The likely need for additional capital to replace expected future losses is putting significant pressure on bank equities broadly . . . In many cases, the equities are down 40-60 per cent over the prior three months. This amounts to a shadow run on several banks.” Still, financials pared early losses as investors bought back into some of the stocks most heavily sold on Monday. By late-
afternoon the sector was down 3 per cent, having bounced off losses of as much as 5.7 per cent.Washington Mutual shares rallied 11.8 per cent to $3.61 after it said it was “well capitalised”. First Horizon, meanwhile, jumped 17 per cent to $5.89 after it reported second-quarter results largely in line with expectations and announced a new chief executive.State Street made ground, rising 7.1 per cent to $59.65 after posting big profit and revenue jumps in the second-quarter.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also pared losses, but only briefly, after Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said his agency would limit short-sales in the shares of the two government-sponsored entities and brokerage firms.The pair slumped 27.3 per cent to $7.07 and 26 per cent to $5.26. Wachovia cut its losses to 7.7 per cent at $9.08 after a spokesperson said it was “fundamentally strong”.Broader markets trimmed losses as oil prices dropped more than $6. The moves helped consumer discretionary stocks to advance in spite of new data showing that retail sales barely budged in June despite the tailwind of massive government rebate stimulus.The consumer discretionary sector rose 0.3 per cent and led by the likes of Hasbro and General Motors which added 6 per cent to $37.05 and 4.9 per cent to $9.84 respectively. GM also said it would undertake a radical restructuring plan, boosting the stocks.Some deal news also lifted sentiment. Sprint Nextel shares surged 9.4 per cent to $9.04 after reports that South Korea’s SK Telecom was in talks to buy the wireless company.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down 1.1 per cent at 1,214.89 points – its lowest level since November 2005. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 10,961.80 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 2,215.71 points.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said: ”It feels like the craziest day ever . . . The volatility index showed some real fear in the morning. But then oil sold off which calmed some people and brought buyers back into the market.”New data from the Labor Department showed that the cost of raw materials for producers continues to rise although core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel, moderated somewhat in June. Such costs are clearly taking their toll. Kimberly-Clark issued a profit warning blaming rising energy and distribution costs. The shares fell 6.5 per cent to $55.01.Eaton, the diversified engineering company, also declined 6.8 per cent to $74.47 after the company said 2008 profit would be lower than it previously projected because of rising oil prices. The industrials sector fell 1.8 per cent.Energy stocks were the biggest fallers, following oil prices lower. ExxonMobil dropped 3.8 per cent to $82.19, Chevron lost 3.6 per cent to $89.42 ConocoPhillips slid 4.1 per cent to $84.82. The sector has now lost 2.9 per cent over the year to date.Healthcare was the leading gainer and the only sector to hold positive territory consistently, climbing 1.3 per cent thanks to some decent earnings news from Johnson & Johnson and Genentech. The pair rose 1.9 per cent to $67.70 and 5.1 per cent to $79.25 respectively."
106;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2008-05-05T02:24:12Z;Asda sparked price-fixing probe;;Asda has emerged as the whistleblower that kick-started the Office of Fair Trading’s investigation into alleged price-fixing of consumer goods from food to toiletries.The supermarket chain, owned by Wal-Mart, the US retail group, will as a result expect immunity from a fine of up to 10 per cent of its revenues should the OFT conclude that a cartel has been operating.The probe has engulfed some of the world’s biggest makers of consumer goods in what is one of the OFT’s biggest investigations.The OFT has visited the UK offices of Procter & Gamble, while letters have been sent to Coca-Cola Enterprises, Mars, Unilever, Nestlé and Kimberly-Clark about their dealings with Britain’s biggest retailers.The OFT has visited Tesco, J. Sainsbury, Wm Morrison and Asda itself, seeking information about prices of groceries, health and beauty products and detergents.Supermarket chains declined to comment on Sunday. However, two people familiar with the situation said they believed the investigation centred on supermarket buyers agreeing to put up prices on certain goods in return for payments. More than 30 suppliers have also been contacted in the past two weeks.Supermarket executives had said privately that Asda was behind the inquiry, pointing out that the scale of the OFT’s inquiry pointed to the whistleblower being one of the big four supermarket operators.Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, shareholder of Sainsbury, attacked the investigation, accusing the OFT of wasting time and energy and calling its actions “outrageous and irresponsible”. Archie Norman, the former Asda chief executive and ex-Conservative MP, has also criticised the probe while other stores said the continual scrutiny from regulators was frustrating.Last month, the Competition Commission, a parallel body to the OFT, found no evidence of direct or indirect collusion on prices by supermarkets following a two-year inquiry into the £120bn ($236bn) grocery industry.Whisteblowers can receive a 100 per cent reduction in fines depending on the information they pass on and whether others come forward. Arla Foods, the UK arm of the Scandinavian farmer-owned dairy processor and Asda’s main supplier, gave the OFT evidence of price-fixing in the dairy industry in 2002 and 2003, which has so far resulted in fines of £116m.The OFT declined to comment.

He presided over its transformation from a manufacturer operating its own paper and pulp mills, to a group focused on consumer innovation in categories ranging from Huggies nappies and toilet and face tissues, to professional products for the healthcare industry.He joined Kimberly Clark in 1975, and played a leading role in helping to develop Huggies Pull-Ups disposable pants in the late 1980s, now one of the company’s most successful products.As CEO, he oversaw a restructuring that eventually led to disposal of the company’s pulp mills, while digesting the $9.4bn acquisition of Scott Paper. He stepped down as CEO in 2002 at 55, retiring as chairman of Kimberly Clark in 2003.Mr Sanders raises thoroughbred horses. As a college student, he played basketball for the Illinois Institute of Technology.

109;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;US retailers hope for tax boost;;For beleaguered US retailers struggling with slowing consumer demand, relief could be on the way in the form of an estimated $42.9bn spending boost from federal tax rebates, aimed at steering the US away from recession.According to a survey of more than 7,000 people for the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend about 40 per cent of the extra $105.7bn due in rebates that will start arriving in May. A further $30bn will be used to pay down debt, $19.8bn will be saved and the remainder either invested or used to pay for medical bills.However, for retailers and consumer goods companies, much will depend on whether consumers choose to spend the extra money on food and low-margin basics, or on discretionary purchases, such as home goods, electronics and toys.Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup, has said she expects the rebates to deliver a “one-time jolt” to consumer spending. But she told clients that “we expect most consumers who decide to spend their cheques to purchase lower- margin food and consumables” rather than discretionary items.In an indication of the state of lower-income consumers, Wal-Mart said that, in January, its customers were using Christmas gift cards to pay for food and other basics, rather than buy discretionary goods.Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, and other discounters are expected to offer free cheque cashing facilities for rebate cheques, and they are likely to be prime beneficiaries of the extra spending. Citigroup says that, in 2001, about 25 per cent of a similar round of rebate cheques were spent at Wal-Mart.But if the large discounters – Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target – seem well-positioned to win business from hard-pressed consumers, others who depend on discretionary spending, or spending linked to the housing market – such as Home Depot or Macy’s department stores – seem less likely to benefit.The split in fortunes between basic and discretionary spending extends across the consumer sector.In the food industry, restaurants are showing signs of strain: same-store sales growth at McDonald’s has been slowing, while Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, has declared that the US consumer is already in a recession, as his company reported a second quarter of falling traffic.However, food companies such as Kellogg, Kraft and Pepsico are more troubled by higher commodity prices than slowing demand, and see themselves as able to profit if consumers opt to eat at home, rather than restaurants.Also, suppliers of household staples, such as Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark and Clorox, argue that they have seen no significant slowing in demand, or evidence of consumers shifting to cheaper alternatives.Ian Cook, chief executive of Colgate Palmolive, told investors that “so far we are seeing no indication of the slowdown,” in the US.But beyond personal care, companies that sell even some of the most basic household products have been feeling the pressure. Newell Rubbermaid, whose products range from storage bins to baby chairs, cut its 2008 sales growth forecast on January 31 to 2-3 per cent, down from its previous forecast of 3-5 per cent.Martin Franklin, chief executive of Jarden, argues that his company’s lower-cost consumer products such as coffee pots and fire extinguishers will benefit from the rebates. “I don’t think the stimulus package is going to make you go out and buy that $2,000 flat-screen TV.“But when it comes to going out and buying some of the smaller ticket items that you have in your life that you don’t want to cut back on, then I think the stimulus package will have a positive effect.”Predictably, US retailers welcomed the federal tax rebates, which they had lobbied strongly for. Tracy Mullin, chief executive of the NRF, described the package as “a crucial component to economic recovery”.But as retailers set out their first-quarter earnings view over the coming two weeks, investors still expect the overall mood to remain sober, with retailers taking a conservative approach to inventory planning, with resulting knock-on effects for their suppliers.
110;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2008-01-06T17:08:46Z;Insider with a calling to clean up;;"Tom Falk, chief executive of Kimberly-Clark, prefers to shun the first person singular. Ask him about five years at the top of one of the world’s largest consumer product companies, and he prefers to lay the stress on “we”, “us” and “the team”.“The thing I’m most proud of,” he says, “is that the team put together a global business plan to really transform Kimberly-Clark. And we have executed it.”That five-year plan, launched in mid-2003, involved big changes at the company whose leading brands include Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, Scott and Andrex bathroom tissues, with annual sales of more than $17bn. The tasks included strengthening the company’s focus on developing markets, improving its brand marketing capabilities, and managing a painful restructuring process that has resulted in the loss of 6,000 jobs – 10 per cent of the workforce.“I just feel really good about what the team has accomplished,” he says, conceding the difficulties of the job losses.The self-effacing style, together with a low-key, measured delivery, fits with 49-year-old Mr Falk’s all-American, Midwestern background. The eldest of nine children, he grew up in modest circumstances in Iowa, the quintessentially Midwestern state, where his father owned a small petrol station. He went to college at the University of Wisconsin and worked briefly for a firm of accountants, before joining Kimberly-Clark – still in Wisconsin – in 1983.But his subsequent 25-year career with the company has not been that of a conservative company insider. In 2002, as president and chief operating officer, he played a leading role in the gradual disposal of the company’s pulp mills and fine paper business – moving Kimberly-Clark from its roots in paper manufacturing fully into the faster moving world of consumer packaged goods and into head-to-head competition with Procter & Gamble and Unilever.The past five years have focused on continuing that transformation, moving the company towards one “driven by what the customer wants to a larger extent than we ever were in the past”.“My challenge, as a CEO who has grown up in the company, is to come in, and be willing to change it …and to change it a lot in some cases,” he says. “My task is to bend it, without breaking it. And that’s a nice tension to focus on.”To this end, he took the fairly radical step of bringing in the company’s first chief marketing officer – Tony Palmer – in 2006. Not only was the position new, but Mr Palmer, who previously worked for Kellogg’s, was a rare outside hire in a company that, like its rival P&G, had always promoted from within. Mr Falk followed the appointment later that year with another outsider, Robert Black, as chief of strategy and now head of innovation.Mr Falk made sure Mr Palmer was positioned at the centre of things, with an office “about 25 feet from my desk”.“Bringing someone in like that, it is all about helping them find quick wins, getting them some traction in the organisation, demonstrating support from the senior team, so that they can have an impact and they can make a difference.”But he is quick to point out that being close to the chief executive has not meant being closely controlled by the chief executive: “I don’t make creative decisions; they don’t show me advertising before it runs,” says Mr Falk of the TV ads produced by the marketing team. “I see it when it is on the air.”“I trust the process …If every decision has to go to the CEO, how much is it going to get watered down as it goes through the layers of the approval process?”As chief executive, his job, he says, is to deal with investors and the board, as well as strategy and talent development. “That’s where I can have the most leverage and the most impact.”With a global business plan in place, Mr Falk is looking at nurturing new talent, particularly as Kimberly-Clark is experiencing growth of more than 20 per cent a year in China, India and Russia, and strong growth in other developing markets.While Kimberly-Clark sells products in more than 150 countries and has manufacturing operations in 37 countries, its top strategic management team remains predominantly American, although Tony Palmer, the new recruit, was born in Australia. While Mr Falk may be wearing US flag cufflinks, he definitely does not believe that an American company these days can “take largely US-generated ideas and sell them to the rest of the world”.Hitherto, he says, one of his main challenges has been finding enough talent to staff the company’s rapid international growth, mainly by sending US staff abroad. He now says he hopes to start bringing in local talent from the various regional markets. “We’ve done some of it, but not as much as I’d like, and we should be able to do more going forward.”Mr Falk, who is based at Kimberly-Clark’s HQ in Dallas, himself makes six or seven substantial foreign trips a year. While travelling – and while at home in the US – he looks for inspiration by visiting stores and watching shoppers, and from visiting some of the company’s professional clients.“You have to find ways to get out of your office …I don’t learn anything in my office,” he says.The trips, he says, involve “just being curious” and expose him to “interesting packaging ideas, new product ideas, or different ways of launching or displaying products”.Mr Falk has also applied the same tactics to the company’s board. Traditionally, he says, the board was regularly taken to visit new company manufacturing plants, so they could see the investments they had approved. But then Craig Sullivan, a board member who was formerly chief executive of Clorox, the household products company, suggested that perhaps they could visit customers instead.“It was one of those ‘ah ha!’ moments,” says Mr Falk, who has over the past three years taken his board to visit the company’s three largest US retail customers.“You get to see the store through the eyes of the senior management of the customer, what they’re trying to accomplish and how they’ve set up the merchandise …it’s a great learning experience for all of us.”Mr Falk believes that his eventual successor – not that he is planning to step down – will have to have “a passion” for the new ways of customer-focused marketing. But so far, he says, the changes over the past five years are a story of strategic method and process, rather than personality: “You like to think that strategy is not necessarily tied to any one individual.”Speed demon polishes up his act with customer factory visitsTom Falk travelled to Britain last year on a business trip that included a visit to the Aston Martin car factory outside Coventry, where he talked to workers who used Kimberly-Clark’s professional wipes to prepare the cars’ bodywork for painting.“We got to watch them use our products and to talk to the guys who were doing that [about] what they liked and didn’t like. And it was a fantastic experience,” he says. The trip was also a personal pilgrimage he owns two Corvettes and races one of them every year at 150mph around a speedway in Wisconsin.After the visit to Aston Martin he went to a Walkers potato crisps factory, where Kimberly-Clark wipes are also used.During the factory visits, Mr Falk’s team took detailed notes and gathered samples of used product, all of which was subsequently fed back to the product innovation team behind the wipes.Mr Falk enthuses about the factory trips: “It’s so great when you are in an environment like that with customers, and the information is totally unfiltered. They’re not trying to tell me what they think I want to hear, they’re telling it like it is.”"

112;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2007-09-12T07:47:36Z;Soft soap?;;"Doing laundry in America will never be the same again. In a massive operation starting this month, every big retailer and every leading manufacturer is switching to smaller bottles of double-strength liquid detergent – a shift that will reduce the use of plastics, water and fuel.In Hawaii and California, engineers are meanwhile working to install 22 arrays of solar power panels that will together produce as much as 20m kilowatt hours of electricity a year, in one of the world’s largest initiatives to draw energy from the sun. On the other side of the world, Thai shrimp farmers have been upgrading their operations to meet new certification standards set by the Global Aquaculture Alliance. Behind all three changes lies the world’s biggest retailer – Wal-Mart.It is two years since Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, announced that the company was embarking on a drive to improve its much-criticised reputation on issues such as its environmental impact, diversity policies and working conditions in its vast global supply chain. “Due to our size and scope, we are uniquely positioned to have great success and impact in the world, perhaps like no company before us,” Mr Scott declared, in a speech that set out ambitious specific targets including cuts in the waste it generates and the energy it uses.Because of Wal-Mart’s sheer size and market share, most of its rivals have no choice but to follow its lead – and the company has found itself setting standards beyond those that regulators require. “They have so much market power that they could drive environmental change through 50,000 companies, something that Congress and the Bush administration has refused to do,” says Michael Marx of Corporate Ethics International, one of the first environmentalist activists to sit down with the retailer’s executives.The greening of Wal-Mart continues apace, represented in its most banal form by the mini-sized business cards made from recycled paper that its executives now wield. The retailer, long accused of using its market power to lower standards, is setting and supporting the development of more demanding requirements on issues ranging from packaging to gemstone mining. Suppliers and activist groups that once duelled over government regulatory standards are battling instead to win over the Wal-Mart buyers who head its product-
focused “sustainability networks”.Wal-Mart’s most vociferous critics say it is doing nothing more than “greenwashing” a fundamentally unsustainable business model. They claim the strategy is an attempt to split the alliance of US labour and environmental groups that has sought to slow Wal-Mart’s efforts to open new stores and has supported attempts to pass legislation that would hamper the company’s profitability.Mr Scott, on the other hand, has presented the shift as an inevitable move to accept its responsibilities as global market leader and has unleashed the group’s reserves of apparently boundless enthusiasm on the field of environmental and social sustainability. Using its market clout, the company has driven down prices for products such as low-
energy lightbulbs. Its new enthusiasm for solar and wind power, say, or its support for a hybrid electric truck project, offers the developers of sustainable technologies the lure of a potentially large-scale customer base and associated economies of scale.Wal-Mart’s buying power is also changing the way that other American companies and industries do business. In the mundane world of laundry detergent, the imminent shift to double concentrate came after Wal-Mart started indicating that it wanted to see its suppliers taking active steps to reduce packaging – with Mr Scott personally praising Unilever for developing a triple-
concentrate version of its All detergent. Procter & Gamble, Henkel and Church & Dwight took the hint and all the four largest producers will introduce the double concentrate at the same time – supported not just by Wal-Mart but also by its rival Target and the big US supermarket chains – a rare example of an industry-wide change being brought about without regulation.Kert Davies, research director on climate change at Greenpeace USA, says he has seen signs of Wal-Mart exerting similar power in a drive to persuade its main suppliers, including the US dairy industry, to adopt full carbon accounting – an issue where US legislators have been loath to take action. “We spend a lot of energy trying to get giant corporations trying to move an inch and here we have the biggest corporation of them all shooting for the same targets,“ he says. “They’re acting as we would act …to get full carbon accounting even before it is required by regulation.”Liquid detergent concentration has been broadly supported by P&G and Unilever, which see long-term savings and other benefits for themselves despite the short-term costs of retooling their factories. But other initiatives have been less warmly received, such as Wal-Mart’s support for a European-style approach to removing potentially dangerous chemicals from consumer products.Under its “preferred products principles”, the retailer named three chemicals, used in cleaning products and insecticides, that it said it wanted its suppliers to phase out – mimicking the approach of Reach, the European Union’s chemical control law. The embrace of EU-style precautionary principles was a deep shock to a global chemical industry that actively lobbied against Reach in Europe.“I would say that the chemical industry is scared stiff,” says Mike Schade of the Center for Health, Environment & Justice’s “Be safe” campaign, who argues that Wal-Mart could also push its suppliers to adopt product safety standards set by the European cosmetics directive. “In the US our laws have failed to protect us from exposure to unnecessary and harmful chemicals in consumer products …That’s why we really need actions from companies like Wal-Mart, in the absence of real reform from the federal government,” he says.Wal-Mart says it consults with suppliers on standards. But its efforts to set higher environmental goals than those legally required mean that the retailer is attracting the kind of lobbying that would have previously been directed at central government, from both environmentalists and from industry.For example, its declaration that it wanted suppliers to stop using PVC in packaging because of possible health concerns – following similar moves by Ikea and Hennes & Mauritz, the Swedish chains – brought a rapid response from the Vinyl Institute, the industry’s lobbying body, which was determined to change Wal-Mart’s position.The Vinal Institute has been telling industry members of its efforts to persuade Wal-Mart to move away from its commitments. In a sign of the intense struggle taking place over the stores group’s position on this kind of issue, the institute has also said it was working to have a sympathetic expert installed on a panel advising the retailer on policy.Similar efforts are being made by other industry groups to counter the efforts of environmentalists to steer the retailer’s direction, says Mr Marx at Corporate Ethics International. “When they saw how fast the leading big-box retailer was moving, various industries realised they needed to kick it up in terms of their lobbying effort, to get things watered down.”Greenpeace’s Mr Davies wonders how tough Wal-Mart’s executives are willing to be, asking: “What happens when a major supplier doesn’t want to move?” Greenpeace, he points out, is campaigning against Kimberly-Clark, the consumer products company, over its paper pulp sourcing. “If they really stuck to their guns they wouldn’t buy paper products from Kimberly-Clark; they wouldn’t sell Kleenex.”In addition to criticism from environmental groups if it continues buying from unco-operative suppliers, Wal-Mart also faces pressure when the new standards it does succeed in making stick set the bar too low. One example is in shrimp farming – Wal-Mart has pledged to sell farmed shrimp only from operations that have been granted certification under a process developed by the Missouri-based Global Aquaculture Alliance. But some activists argue that both the standard and its enforcement are inadequate, misleading shoppers who buy shrimp marked as being from supposedly “sustainable” shrimp farms.John Hocevar, Greenpeace USA’s fisheries expert, says the GAA has improved as a result of a dialogue with activist groups encouraged by Wal-Mart – which wants a credible standard. But he still has reservations. “When a company the size of Wal-Mart is willing to endorse the GAA, that gives it a new level of credibility that may or may not be warranted …It is going to make it harder for a more genuine or more eco-friendly certification to survive,” he says.Jennifer Lash, of the Living Oceans Society, which works to protect marine life, says: “We’re very concerned that with Wal-Mart being such a huge driving force in the market, there will be a rush to meet the lowest possible standards in order to feed the Wal-Mart machine.”The reservations reflect the enduring broader concerns of environmentalists over Wal-Mart’s business model. Last week, a range of activist environmental groups published a report highly critical of Wal-Mart’s overall sustainability drive – reflecting how this shift by the company has accentuated divisions between radical and moderate voices within the US environmental movement.The coalition’s report complains that the company is operating a global supply chain that produces 40 times more greenhouse gas than it has pledged to eliminate. It also argues that Wal-Mart’s focus on cost-cutting contributes to problems including illegal logging and the exploitation of workers in its
supply chain. In addition, it highlights Wal-Mart’s funding of conservative
political candidates who have voted against moves to increase vehicle fuel efficiency or strengthen environmental protections.“Wal-Mart can change to more efficient lightbulbs but that doesn’t change its carbon footprint or the enormous social consequences of its globally unsustainable business model,” says Ruben Garcia, of Global Exchange, a trade and economic rights group.All sides are awaiting Wal-Mart’s first sustainability report, in which it has pledged to give an account of how much it has achieved and to set benchmarks for the future. Activists also await evidence that Wal-Mart is prepared to accept that some things may have to cost more in a world where it is committed to a range of sustainability issues.“There’s a split within the environmental community around Wal-Mart,” says Mr Marx. “You have the large, moderate groups that are trying to seize the opportunity to make whatever changes possible …and there are the more grassroots groups who are concerned that the changes give Wal-Mart good environmental cover but ultimately undercut the kind of changes that we really need to make.”What is clear is that Wal-Mart has already won over many of its former critics with its readiness to pursue ambitious targets on issues such as energy saving.Gwen Ruta, of Environmental Defense, which has worked closely with Wal-Mart on its sustainability efforts, says she expects the company “to bring new commercial technologies into the commercial marketplace through [its] gravitational pull” – both for customers and for other retailers. “I think we’re just seeing the tip of the iceberg of what they can accomplish.”“I love that they just go for it,” says Greenpeace’s Mr Davies, who recalls Wal-Mart department heads setting ambitious and largely arbitrary targets for cutting greenhouse gases. “The energy-saving sits very well with their basic practices. It is the same reason you can buy your pair of socks for a nickel …That’s what they do well.”Charity towards trades unions begins – but not at homeRenato Pambid is a Filipino lawyer working with the Workers Assistance Committee, a local labour group, in the sprawling Cavite export processing zone outside Manila. His work has recently included representing employees at the Korean-owned Chong Won Fashion factory who had been sacked after forming a union.Picketing workers have been attacked by local security staff and by armed masked men wearing military fatigues.As the dispute started to escalate last year, Mr Pambid and others visited the Manila office of Wal-Mart, which sells clothing produced at the plant by one of its suppliers, One Step Up. “At the start we were not expecting that Wal-Mart would intervene,” says Mr Pambid. With polite understatement, he adds that the US retailer has a reputation for “not being amenable to union formation”.But in what he says was a first, Wal-Mart set up a joint meeting with the management and the union in an effort to work out a compromise.It subsequently commissioned its own report into the dispute and then demanded that the management reinstate the sacked workers. No compromise resulted. So this year Wal-Mart and its suppliers cut their links with the factory.Labour activists in North America who were involved in efforts to resolve the dispute say it could have done more. “It took Wal-Mart nine months to get to the point of confronting the management with the fact that the workers’ right to freedom of association had been violated. They could have moved in a much more timely manner,” says Bob Jeffcott, of the Maquila Solidarity Network, a Toronto-based labour rights group. David Schilling, supply chain specialist at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, also says that Wal-Mart’s response was flawed.But both men welcome the retailer’s efforts to try to resolve the dispute. “The company stayed longer than it has been the practice in the past …They reached out to discuss issues on the ground, which in the past they have been pretty reluctant to do,” says Mr Schilling.For most labour activists, Wal-Mart’s low-cost mantra has made it the ultimate symbol of the abuses created by a global supply chain that pits factory owners in China or the Philippines against each other in a desperate battle for contracts. In 2005, for instance, activists tried to sue the retailer in the US over abuses such as excessive working hours and unpaid wages at factories in
five different countries.Many anti-sweatshop campaigners remain dismissive of its efforts to step up the monitoring of its vast supply chain in order to reduce abuses. The International Labor Rights Forum, which backed the attempted legal action, dismisses Wal-Mart’s latest ethical sourcing report, saying the group’s focus on low prices “all but ensures that it will make little progress in respecting workers’ rights”. It also highlights the clash at Chong Won, saying Wal-Mart’s monitoring had failed to expose the problems at the factory.But Wal-Mart’s latest account of its ethical sourcing efforts also shows how it is changing in ways that could theoretically prevent the kind of crisis seen at Chong Won. In particular, the company says it wants to reinforce factory monitoring with efforts to create a “a new company-supplier relationship” that would involve a shift to “longer-term commitments” – a fundamental shift from the ultra-competitive, price-focused approach so bitterly criticised by the ILRF and others.Wal-Mart also says it is beginning to look at how its own behaviour – such as demanding short lead times or last-minute design changes – can put undue pressure on suppliers and result in issues such as unpaid working or excessive overtime. “The overarching goal is to fully integrate labour compliance and social responsibility into all purchasing decisions,” the report says.The approach mirrors steps by companies that have taken a lead in efforts to improve their supply chains, such as Gap and Nike. But it raises questions over whether Wal-Mart’s cost-focused buyers, the people who make the hard purchasing decisions, will listen to the ethical sourcing message. “We need to see evidence that the approach is being really integrated,” says Mr Schilling.Wal-Mart’s proposed new approach also presents another challenge to a fundamental element of its corporate culture – its strongly anti-union record in the US. Gap, Nike, Marks & Spencer and others are starting to work with international unions and labour rights groups on efforts to educate their suppliers about workers’ rights, arguing that an engaged workforce is the best monitor of what is happening in a factory. But the main text of Wal-Mart’s ethical report contains only one mention of working with unions or local labour groups.Wal-Mart’s record at home has also complicated its efforts to draw up an international code of practice for suppliers, a move backed by Tesco, Carrefour and Metro, the European retail groups. The initiative includes standards far more ambitious than Wal-Mart’s own corporate code of conduct.It recognises, for instance, that “workers have the right to form trade unions of their own choosing”, sets shorter maximum working hours and has comparatively strong language on the need to pay adequate wages.Human Rights Watch in New York and the Clean Clothes Campaign in Europe have both pointed out that the code sets standards for Wal-Mart’s suppliers, on issues such as trade union membership, that are at odds with the company’s own anti-union attitude in the US. According to Maquila’s Mr Jeffcott, Wal-Mart’s domestic stance on unions can make it harder for the retailer to convince hard-pressed suppliers round the world that it is serious about the rights of their workers.“It could be that a supplier doesn’t really believe that Wal-Mart is serious …given its own history on the issue,” he says."
113;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2007-05-04T18:58:45Z;Sears in online research push;;Sears Holdings, the third largest US retailer, has launched an ambitious online customer research effort, backed up by a $5,000 monthly sweepstake prize, in an effort to support the development of its $55bn business.The move comes against the background of what the company has called “a major ecommerce initiative” that has become one of the main areas for new investment by the company created by the 2005 merger of Sears and Kmart.The retailer is inviting online customers to sign up for membership of the “My SHC Community”, and to participate in forums with senior company executives about “what is working in the retail industry and what is in need of desperate repair”.Sears also requires members to intall an application on their computers that will provide detailed information on all internet usage, ranging from normal web browsing, to behaviour during secure e-commerce sessions, and “the pace and style of internet behaviour”.In return, it says, it will offer incentives including a monthly sweepstake with a top prize of $5,000, as well as offers and promotions, and “free planning and budgeting tools”.The Sears approach recalls similar online tactics developed by consumer goods companies such as Procter & Gamble and Kimberly Clark. But its open approach goes beyond previous efforts by US retailers, who have largely focused on building up small and less publicised online panels of regular users to assist with research into customer behaviour and attitudes.A new related website acknowleges the extent to which members will offer the retailer an extremely intimate look at their online behaviour. Sears says it makes “commercially viable efforts” to filter out confidential information such as UserIDs, passwords, credit card numbers, and account numbers.”Edward Lampert, the investor who is Sears Holdings’ chairman, has stressed the potential of the online presence of both Sears and Kmart, in contrast to his efforts to cut back on spending on the stores themselves over the past two years.In December Sears announced it would open a new e-commerce development centre in downtown Chicago that is currently recruiting web developers and analysts.Sears does not publish online sales figures, but the Sears and Kmart websites are believed to have sales of well over $2bn. However, traffic to both sites currently lags behind their main rivals, according to data from comScore Media Metrix, with 8.6 million unique visitors to Sears.com in March, against over 12 million for JC Penney and over 25 million for Wal-Mart and Target.Sears saw its shares fall on Friday, after it issued a forecast for first quarter revenues that was below analysts’ expectations, and published figures which showed a further drop in same-store sales at Kmart. The shares were down almost five per cent at $179.06 in late trading on Friday.
114;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Kimberly Clark soars on international sales;;Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, said its first quarter profit soared by 64 per cent on a strong performance in its international business.The consumer products maker said it had been hit by $60m in unexpected costs due to inflation in the costs of fibre, making up the lion’s share of an overall $80m rise in costs. Most of the rest of the cost rises were made up by a hike in marketing spending of almost $20m.“Escalation in fiber costs is driving a higher level of inflation than we assumed coming into the year,” said Thomas Falk, chairman and chief executive. He added that he expected the cost to be offset by improvements in business performance.Net income was $452m, or 98 cents a share, up from $275m, or 60 cents, last year. Excluding special items, net income was $1.03, beating analysts’ forecasts, according to Reuters Estimates, of $1.01 a share.Kimberly-Clark gave a preview of its earnings in March, saying that it expected to reach or beat the top end of a previous forecast of 99 cents to $1.01 per share.The earnings include a $53m charge from a cost-cutting and restructuring plan started in 2005, which aims to deliver $350m savings by 2009. Costs of the consolidation of tissue manufacturing operations in Europe and infant and child care operations in North America, as well as administrative “streamlining” in North America and Europe lay behind the charge, the company said.The company has 24 facilities slated for sale, closure or streamlining as part of the restructuring.Net sales rose 7.8 per cent to $4.4bn in the quarter.Sales of personal care products, which include Huggies diapers and Kotex feminine care items, rose 10.6 per cent in the first quarter, boosted by sales volume growth of more than 8 per cent. Sales in North America rose by 8 per cent against a 12 per cent jump in European sales and a 16 per cent rise in emerging markets such as Russia and Latin America.Sales of tissues rose by 6.4 per cent, pushed on by an 11 per cent rise in emerging markets. The company said Kleenex sales rose despite a “weaker cold and flu season than in 2006”.Kimberly-Clark’s operations in emerging markets are an important growth area, currently making up a smaller fraction of sales, but with large potential markets.The company reaffirmed its earnings forecast for the year of between $4.10 and $4.20 per share, up 5 to 8 per cent from last year. It said it expected $1.01 to $1.03 per share in the second quarter.Shares in Kimberly-Clark were down 51 cents at $71.35 in early trading.
115;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Disciple of enlightened growth;;"At the head office of Seventh Generation, there is plenty of evidence of what Jeffrey Hollender, founder and chief executive, likes to call “the swirl”.Several affable dogs wander round the premises of the environmentally friendly household products company in Burlington, Vermont. There are complementary weekly massages for staff and a games room with ping-pong and table soccer.And then there is Gregor Barnum, the company’s “director of corporate consciousness”, a serene-looking man who talks of the importance of challenging linear thinking and stresses the process of “becoming” over “being”.“Gregor sent me a note about a meeting yesterday, and I’m, like, ‘what’s this about? It’s from outer space’,” says Mr Hollender. “But he forces you to think differently.”Of late, the swirl has been working overtime at Seventh Generation – its name inspired by a precept that required Iroquois tribal leaders to consider the impact of their decisions on those at least seven generations to come.Compared with industry leaders Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, Seventh Generation remains a tiny player in the household products business, with overall sales now approaching just $100m and only 52 employees. Its 92 per cent share of the natural market for disposable nappies in the US translates into just 0.2 per cent of the overall market, with a similarly small share in other categories.But the company now styles itself as “the leading brand of non-toxic household products”, occupying a place in the US similar to Belgium’s Ecover in Europe. Its products, ranging from bathroom cleaner and laundry detergent to paper tissues and tampons, appear on a growing number of supermarket shelves as well as at a number of Target discount stores.“It’s really only in the last five years that we’ve started to do well,” says Mr Hollender, who started the company in 1988 and recalls the struggle of trying to sell organic cotton clothes and book bags throughout the 1990s.After going public in 1993 in the search for funds, a group of investors took the company private again in 1999, just as Seventh Generation began to experience a remarkable shift in fortunes.The change was driven not just by its own efforts but also by the dramatic expansion of its largest retail
client, Whole Foods Market, the supermarket chain that was prospering on the growing interest in natural and organic food and products.“Whole Foods has played an incredible role in our success,” says Mr Hollender of the chain that has expanded from 87 stores in 1999 to more than 180 today. “Every time a Whole Foods store opened, they exposed a whole bunch of new consumers to our brand.”Seventh Generation also caught the zeitgeist as it widened its marketing message beyond concern for the environment to issues of environmental health in the home – epitomised by the launch of its unscented “free and clear” detergents and cleaners.“Because there were so many people with asthma and so many people with allergies, we just struck a chord by having products that were unscented,” he says.Backed by the demand, the company introduced chlorine-free disposable nappies in 2003 and organic cotton tampons this year while working to improve the performance of its existing cleaners and detergents.It has now arrived at what Mr Hollender believes is a defining moment in its development. Instead of a largely passive approach, which sought to make “less bad” versions of existing products, Seventh Generation is now aspiring to make products that are, he says, “actually good”.“We’re changing from being driven by what the manufacturers could and wanted to do …to a whole different perspective that is much more driven by the consumer and by where we believe we need to go,” he says.Over the past year, its staff has doubled in size while it has tripled its previously low level of spending on product development, including heavy investment in new packaging.All this has stirred the swirl. This summer Mr Barnum organised the first of a series of “biomimicry design” brainstorming sessions, “to think about the process of innovating some of our products using designs inspired by nature”.He also played a leading role in the discussion of whether the company should start to source its bottle tops from China – for a 60 per cent cost reduction. The decision was no.“It was a big ‘no’. It was also a big ’know’,” he says of the way that debate forced the company to look at where it was going.Executives at Seventh Generation’s giant rivals, P&G and Kimberly Clark, sound dismissive when asked about its efforts, arguing that requiring customers to pay a premium for “green” products will eventually fail, just as it did in the 1970s.Mr Hollender counters that the company strives to remove the pricing differential on conventional products and that Seventh Generation and Ecover now set standards on issues such as transparency on ingredients, which have been adopted by their larger competitors.The brand’s recent successes have attracted attention from private investors and others, raising the question whether Seventh Generation will go the way of other US standard-bearers of alternative business such as Tom’s of Maine, the natural toothpaste firm bought this year by Colgate, or Ben & Jerry’s, the Vermont ice-cream company bought by Unilever in 2002.“I have a list of natural products companies that are still independent and it is not a very long list,” says Mr Hollender. He argues that larger packaged goods companies have a record of stifling innovation at the takeover target and poorly serving its employees.He has, he says, not even asked the value of a series of offers from interested investors and that the company’s principal investors support its longer-term goals, which include increasing employee share ownership from 14 to 50 per cent over the next five years.Mr Hollender, who was recently persuaded by his staff to trade in a fuel efficient Audi convertible for a 1983 Mercedes Benz diesel that can burn vegetable oil, half jokes that sometimes he wishes there was a little less swirl and a little more linear thinking at Seventh Generation’s head office.But the company’s very public efforts to work out what is the best thing to do – frequently laid bare in its website and three employee blogs – are also a fundamental part of what the marketing world would call its brand promise.“In a sense, we’re not selling a product,” says Mr Hollender. “We’re really selling a point of view about the world and where we want to go that we hope more and more people will want to be a part of.”Quest for the right chemistryNaturally Clean, published last year and written and compiled by Jeffrey Hollender, his daughter and two employees of Seventh Generation, the non-toxic household goods company, lists a range of chemicals that are found in common household cleaning products.Most, such as amyl acetate, used in furniture polish, are not regarded by federal regulators as posing significant risks to environmental health. But amyl acetate has been named as a suspected neurotoxin by environmental health experts in Scandinavia.According to the precautionary principle, endorsed by Mr Hollender and his company, this means amyl acetate should be avoided, together with a host of other chemicals that have been introduced into homes. “We should err on the side of caution when making our decisions,” the book argues.Mr Hollender sees current demand for organic food and natural body products as connected with broader concerns about environmental health.“It was food, it was stuff that you put on your skin, and now, in many cases, it is the air you breathe,” he says.The book also provides a list of recommended “natural” cleaning products that name the chemicals they contain. In three categories, it even gives a higher safety rating to some of Seventh Generation’s competitors.Naturally Clean, New Society Publishers, 2005"
116;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2006-10-16T22:51:49Z;Ex-FDA chief charged over stock holdings;;Lester Crawford, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, will plead guilty to charges filed on Monday that he lied about financial holdings and conflicts of interent while he was a top US regulator.He is expected to plead guilty on Tuesday to one federal charge each of making a false statement and conflict of interest. Each charge carries a maximum of one year in jail.Mr Crawford’s indictment and guilty plea marks another blow to a Bush administration official, and highlights continuing scrutiny over conflicts of interest.The charges filed by federal prosecutors in federal court in Washington clarify Mr Crawford’s sudden resignation as FDA chief in September 2005. His resignation came less than three months after the Senate confirmed his nomination by the president to lead the FDA, a powerful regulator overseeing 25 per cent of US gross domestic product.Before his nomination he served for three years as acting FDA commissioner and deputy commissioner.According to the indictment, Mr Crawford lied from 2003 to 2005 about stock and options held by himself and his wife in companies with significant interests in FDA decisions. These stocks included Kimberly-Clark, a consumer products maker, PepsiCo, the soft drinks maker, food group Sysco, and retailer Wal-Mart.The indictment also details how US obesity regulation could have been affected by an alleged conflict of interest between Mr Crawford’s finances and a policy committee he chaired.In 2003, Mr Crawford was chairman of the Obesity Working Group (OWG) at the FDA. The group produced policy recommendations the next year, including new rules for food and soft drink labels’ calories, carbohydrates and contents.“During the entire period from the formation of the OWG . . . Crawford and his wife owned 1,400 shares of PepsiCo stock worth a minimum of about $62,000 and 2,500 shares of Sysco stock, worth a minimum of about $78,000 . . . Shareholders had a financial interest in the OWG’s conclusions and recommendations,” the indictiment said.Mr Crawford is also accused of making false statements on federal financial disclosure forms.
117;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2006-09-07T14:01:53Z;The functions;;Organisations have long sought a better way to run functions like human resources, IT or customer service. In the past, the temptation was to outsource and the really brave sent the function offshore.But now shared services centres have grabbed the attention as a less risky alternative and one that can be applied to many business functions.Shared services have usually been the preserve of back office functions such as IT or financial operations. But some companies have gone further and extend the shared services idea to embrace front-office functions and even activities like R&D – usually seen as strategic and of high added value.But let’s start at the back. In most organisations, this is an area that only gets noticed when something goes wrong – never when the business is running smoothly. This neglect leads to archaic processes and inefficiencies, with the result that costs go up and productivity comes down.The classic solution is to unload back office processes to a third party provider who promises to do them more cheaply. But according to Kam Soon Siew, managing consultant with Frost & Sullivan, many organisations now prefer the shared services approach because it offers greater control, particularly in areas like staff selection and service quality. And once an internal shared service centre is created, it is relatively easy to move to a full-blown outsourcing agreement later.Some companies, however, go in the opposite direction, bringing an outsourced function in-house. Others opt for a hybrid approach setting up joint ventures or collaborative partnerships with third parties.Whatever form of shared services or outsourcing (SSO) is chosen, the big challenge is knowing where to start. “It depends where the greatest pain is felt,” says Ian Batey, executive consultant at Capgemini.For many organisations, the big pain point is their IT department. The cost of keeping systems up to date and the challenge of ensuring IT services are aligned with business goals create huge headaches. “IT is the most popular business process for SSO and it is also the most mature,” says Mr Siew. However, he says the “Big Bang” approach to IT outsourcing that was popular in the past is now falling out of favour. Too many ambitious IT outsourcing initiatives still go wrong, and so more organisations now prefer to take a phased approach to IT SSO to reduce the risks.Another favourite back office target is finance and accounting, particularly tasks that involve a lot of manual data entry, such as credit card or stock trade processing. To reduce the costs of these labour-intensive operations, banking groups such as HSBC and Citigroup locate their finance and accounting operations in low-cost countries such as India, China and Malaysia.Almost half of large organisations believe their in-house finance and accounting services are burning too much cash, according to research carried out by outsourcing analyst NelsonHall.But it is not just big multinationals that can save money through a shared services F&A model. Nichols, for example, a mid-sized UK food manufacturer famous for its Vimto and Sunkist brands, claims it saves more than £100,000 a year using a shared services centre for its financial operations. Previously, the company’s six operating companies each had their own dedicated financial department and their processes were paper-based.Now, staff in the shared services centre use electronic archiving to instantly retrieve invoices, purchase orders and contracts for the whole group. The time they had spent photocopying and filing is now devoted to more productive activities.Human resources is another function that lends itself well to the shared services approach, although less so to full-blown outsourcing as no vendor has a “completely mature” HR outsourcing capability, argues NelsonHall.BT, the telecoms company, adopted a hybrid approach, partnering with Accenture to centralise its global HR operations. From having more than 40 systems and 14,500 staff, BT managed to shrink its HR operation to just 600 people supporting 103,000 employees worldwide.According to Frost & Sullivan’s Mr Siew, HR is an area that attracts a lot of SSO interest because it allows organisations to “re-engineer” the HR function.“HR tends to be viewed as a low-risk area,” he says, “but it now goes beyond payroll processing and the trend is to use SSO for tasks such as personnel development or corporate learning.”Call centres and customer support have traditionally been treated as low-value back office functions. But today, they are increasingly in the the front line as many businesses recognise that customer service is one of the few differentiators that can help them stand out in a crowded marketplace.Customer service operations are nevertheless notoriously difficult to run efficiently, particularly when fragmented by product and country. For this reason, the multinational consumer products company Kimberly-Clark, recently established a shared services centre in Brighton. This was seen as a way to improve the handling of orders and queries from customers across the whole of Europe.Underpinning the centre is SAP’s customer relationship management (CRM) software. Kimberly-Clark claims the CRM software has eliminated the need for re-keying information and made it easier for service centre staff to access customer queries – a weakness in its previous system.Increasingly, some organisations are applying the shared services model to more strategic functions, such as research and development. One example is Roche, the pharmaceutical giant. Its R&D centre in Shanghai employs about 40 scientists who work in co-operation with the company’s other four global R&D facilities to select new clinical drugs for Roche’s global R&D strategy.Besides scientific research, Mr Siew says white-collar jobs in financial services, such as equity research, financial modelling and analysis, also lend themselves well to SSO and, more controversially, to offshoring.
118;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2006-08-24T17:11:09Z;New tactics in the battle for babies’ bottoms;;"Once there were just Huggies and Pampers, the two leading brands of disposable nappy that between them ruled the changing mat.Now, there are Huggies Convertibles, Overnites and Little Walkers. And there are Pampers Swaddlers, Cruisers and Easy Ups – all weapons in the bat­tle between Kimberly-Clark, maker of Huggies, and Procter & Gamble, owner of Pampers, for the bottoms of babies the world over.This week, Kimberly-Clark unveiled its latest technology in the baby changing arms race: a move to replace its existing premium range with a new Supreme Gentle Care line for newborns and small babies, and a Supreme Natural Fit line for older babies and toddlers.Kimberly-Clark’s decision to break the premium line into two segments reflects a push by both companies to take an increasingly segmented approach to development of their premium product lines, in the face of private label competition.With their non-premium Huggies and Pampers nappies facing intense price competition from the private label rivals sold at discount stores, pharmacies and supermarkets, the two companies are counting on their innovative edge to deliver products that parents are prepared to pay more for.Robert Thibault, president of Kimberly-Clark’s childcare business, says the two new lines, which will be laun­ched in Europe later this year, will be backed by the biggest marketing effort since the launch of Huggies’ original premium line in 1994.Kimberly-Clark says both products aim to address parents’ concerns over comfort. The Gentle Care product uses a new lining fabric called “cuddleweave” that Mr Thibault says feels like a “soft blanket”. The Natural Fit line is thinner and incorporates a new “figure-of-eight” cut that the company argues is more comfortable for babies’ legs.The marketing of the nappies – featuring Disney’s Winnie the Pooh and other characters – will include
television advertising in 1,800 hospitals through Kimberly-Clark’s sponsorship of I-Village’s Parenting Network.Irina Barbalova, who tracks disposable paper products for Euromonitor, says Kimberly-Clark’s move can be seen partly as a res­ponse to the success of P&G’s Pampers in creating its Baby Stages premium categories, which are segmented into Swaddlers for newborn and small babies, and Cruisers for crawling babies. Last year, according to Euromonitor, P&G’s market share increased by 1.9 percentage points to 41.1 per cent, while Kimberly-Clark’s share slipped by 0.6 percentage points to 43.5 per cent.“P&G’s growth in 2005 was based on that Baby Stages line. So Kimberly-Clark’s move could be treated as a response to that, or rather an effort to stay ahead and gain share,” says Ms ­Barbalova.P&G, which also produces the economy-focused Luvs brand, has steadily increased its share of the overall US disposable nappy market over the past five years through aggressive pricing and product innovation.Both Huggies and Pampers’ premium lines cost about 30 per cent more per nappy than their conventional lines. However, both P&G and Kimberly-Clark report strong growth in the premium product lines.“If [parents] believe they can provide more comfort to their baby, they are willing to pay more,” says Craig Wanous, brand manager of Huggies.Kimberly-Clark introduced its Little Walkers line in the UK last month, aimed at children who have just started walking but are not old enough to pull on disposable “pull-up” pants. It has also launched a range called “convertibles” that can be either pulled up or put on as a conventional nappy.Both companies are reinforcing their efforts to develop premium, niche products with brand extension into other products, moving be­yond wipes into cleaning products and baby toiletries. They are also focused on selling both standard and premium lines in the developing world.In the US, both companies, meanwhile, have remained locked in a price war for nappies that erupted in 2002. Last year, the prices of Procter & Gamble’s brands fell about 2 per cent while Kimberly-Clark’s decreased by about 1 per cent, according to Euromonitor.Mr Thibault says Kimberly-Clark would be selling its new lines at the same prices as the existing Huggies Premium range."
119;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Kimberly-Clark ‘on track’ despite energy costs;;Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, on Wednesday raised its estimate for the impact of higher commodity and energy costs this year, but said this would be offset with price increases and improved operations.The company said input cost increases for the year would be up “substantially” compared with previous assumptions. It estimated cost inflation of $300m to $350m, against a prior forecast increase of $250m.During the second quarter, the company said it had already absorbed about $100m in cost inflation, comprising nearly $30m for oil-based materials, $10m for fibre, $25m for energy and $35m for distribution.However, the company also increased its estimate of the benefit expected from a number of price rises introduced during the first half of the year. It said this, combined with significantly improved performance by its Mexican subsidiary, would balance the higher than expected input costs.The price increases during the second quarter included Kleenex tissues in the US, resulting in a 4 per cent decline in sales volume for the overall consumer tissue category during the quarter.The overall value of sales in the category rose slightly, supported by other price increases in the first quarter.Tom Falk, chief executive, said Kimberly-Clark remained “on track” with its commitments for the year, but the environment was not easy. Mr Falk said he had not seen any significance evidence of consumers responding to higher fuel prices and other factors by seeking out lower-cost alternatives to some of the company’s leading brand name products.“In some of the developing and emerging markets, you’re seeing consumers even there still willing to buy better quality products. In the US and Europe …you are not seeing any major consumer downshifting”, he said.Kimberly-Clark, which announced a restructuring plan last year, reported that profits fell 10 per cent against the same quarter last year to $377.6m, or 82 cents per share. Sales rose 4 per cent to $4.2bn.The results included a $60m after-tax charge related to restructuring, which involves cutting 6,000 jobs.
120;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2006-04-24T14:35:34Z;Higher costs dent Kimberly-Clark profits;;Kimberly-Clark, the paper products group, on Monday reported flat underlying profits in the first-quarter as its restructuring programme pushed net income lower by more than a third while costs rose.The nappies-to-tissue group said income after exceptional items was 93 cents per share, the same as a year ago, on revenues that rose 4.2 per cent to $4.1bn, beating average analyst estimates by a slim margin. Net income was $275m, down 39 per cent from the $450.1m reported the previous year. Per-share net income fell by 35 per cent to 60 cents, from 93 cents.Kimberly-Clark reiterated its full-year earnings forecasts and said current quarter earnings would be “similar or slightly better” than in the first three months of the year.Kimberly-Clark is nine months into a restructuring plan aimed at reducing 10 per cent of its workforce in a bid to revive profit margins, which have lagged revenue growth due largely to rising costs of raw-materials. Thomas Falk, chief executive, said the company absorbed almost $90m in cost inflation in the latest period.The cost of goods sold rose by 12.1 per cent to $2.9bn in the first quarter in a continued reflection of the headwinds facing Kimberly-Clark.Currency effects took a bite out of revenue growth, which was 6 per cent excluding those factors. Kimberly-Clark said higher prices and a favourable product mix contributed about 1 per cent each to a rise in sales volumes of 4 per cent.The company said sales enjoyed double-digit growth in both developed and developing markets, while volumes growth was “solid” for a wide range of products in both North America and Europe.Personal-care product sales rose 6 per cent but net selling prices fell about 1 per cent due to higher competition in North America and Europe.Consumer tissue products enjoyed a 3.8 per cent advance in sales, or more than 6 per cent excluding forex effects. Net selling prices rose 2 per cent while volumes rose 3 per cent.In the professional and other products business, sales rose 1.6 per cent but were about 4 per cent higher net of currency effects.Kimberly-Clark’s health care business enjoyed 5 per cent rise in sales due to higher sales volumes, reaching double digits outside North America.Separately, Kimberly-Clark said Robert Black, previously chief operating officer at Sammons Enterprises, the privately held conglomerate, had taken up the new position of chief strategy officer for K-C, reporting to Mr Falk, chief executive.
121;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2006-02-03T00:09:02Z;Argentina puts its faith in controlling prices;;Bidding inside Liniers, one of the world’s biggest cattle markets, is fast and furious. On a good day, 10,000 head of cattle worth an average of $3m (€2.47m, £1.68m) are sold here, and the Buenos Aires market’s prices have become the benchmark for the whole of South America.But market forces are not the only determinant of prices at Liniers.A troubling acceleration in the rate of inflation – the greatest threat to Argentina’s spectacular recovery since the largest sovereign debt default four years ago – is becoming more of a factor. The threat is behind President Nestór Kirchner’s vigorous imposition of price ceilings on a range of basic goods, including beef.Discussions between the government and business leaders have led to the renewal of price agreements with dozens of companies this year, including Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Danone and Kimberly-Clark. Just this week, the government secured agreements with supermarkets, such as Carrefour, to freeze prices on 200 products.Economists point out the obvious practical difficulties involved in such negotiations: “The president himself is sitting down with [for example] milk producers to discuss the price of yoghurt – it’s insane,” says Joaquín Cottani, of Macrovision Consulting, a former undersecretary of economic policy and chief Latin America economist of Lehman Brothers. “Argentina has not discovered a new economic model,” he says, highlighting the country’s unsuccessful past attempts at using price controls, which resulted in hyperinflation.But while most producers have been persuaded to agree to price caps, the beef industry is holding out. “We find it difficult to believe that simply signing a piece of paper will provide a solution,” says Mario Llambias, president of the Rural Confederations of Argentina.Half of beef producers involved in the negotiations have withdrawn, in part because of high export duties. These may be countered by the government’s policy of maintaining a weak peso, which makes goods cheaper abroad, but export taxes and new export restrictions are adversely affecting business.A weak peso has done nothing to stem inflation, which has been roughly doubling each year since 2003, reaching 12.3 per cent in 2005. Some economists fear it could reach 15 per cent this year – a fraction of past levels, but enough to rekindle deep-rooted concerns.Private sector economists criticise the government’s reliance on price controls to contain inflation, as they address the symptoms, rather than the causes, of inflation. “Price controls are not a permanent solution,” says Manuel Sánchez Gómez, a director of MVA Macroeconomia, an economic consultancy in Buenos Aires.In the short-term, price controls have been able to check the rise of inflation – economists calculate they may have lowered it by 0.3 per cent to 1.1 per cent in December.But Miguel Angel Broda, an economist in Buenos Aires, says that in order to control inflation, conventional economic analysis would prescribe a tighter monetary and fiscal policy, and controlling the rise in nominal wages. “This would involve a political cost that the president is not prepared to pay,” he says, pointing to the impressive popularity gained by gross domestic product growth of more than 9 per cent for each of the past three years, although it is expected to slow by 2-3 percentage points this year.As Mr Llambias says, in the longer term, price controls will have the opposite of their intended effect: falling incomes will prevent investment, and subsequently stoke inflation as supply fails to meet demand.Economists say most of the spare capacity created as a result of the crisis in 2001-02 has been used up, and that unless investment increases at a faster rate, full capacity will be reached by the end of this year.The government will be forced to tighten fiscal and monetary policy to stop the economy overheating and will need to keep unions’ wage demands under control.
122;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Energy costs hit Kimberly-Clark profits;;Kimberly-Clark on Tuesday reported a 17 per cent fall in fourth-quarter net income as it battled volatile energy costs and absorbed charges for a restructuring.The maker of Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissue is six months into a plan to shed 10 per cent of its workforce in an attempt to increase margins, which had remained flat even as sales grew, largely due to sharply rising raw materials costs.Thomas Falk, chief executive, highlighted a 70 basis-point improvement in return on invested capital in 2005 as evidence that Kimberly-Clark was making progress in spite of “cost inflation” of $400m last year.That figure was double what the company had expected.Earnings before unusual items in the fourth quarter rose 3 per cent to 95 cents a share, in line with Wall Street expectations.However, Kimberly-Clark saw fourth-quarter net income fall to $371m or 79 cents a share from $445m or 91 cents a year earlier. Sales rose 2.8 per cent to $4bn, the smallest gain in three years, though sales in emerging markets grew by double digit figures.In the third quarter, Kimberly-Clark reported a 9 per cent rise in net income excluding charges.The company’s shares were 2 per cent lower by early afternoon at $58.70 on Tuesday.Justin Hott, analyst at Bear Stearns, said in a report: “We saw nothing in the numbers to indicate Kimberly-Clark is reaching a positive inflection point.” Mr Falk said the crude oil price was “probably more volatile than it’s ever been” and that the company was doing more hedging of natural gas than it had previously.The company was 70 per cent hedged up to March – covering the worst winter months – and 50 per cent hedged “through the summer months”.It also had some hedges in place “through the winter months of next year”.
123;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2005-07-25T17:06:09Z;Xerox details job cuts as margins stay slim;;"Xerox yesterday joined a number of US companies that are cutting jobs when it gave details of about 2,600 lay-offs as it moves aggressively to counter weaker margins in sales of office equipment.The company best-known for making copiers and printers said second quarter net income more than doubled to $423m compared with $208m last year after a gain from a tax settlement.But second quarter gross margins of 39 per cent were in the low end of expectations because of weaker sales of high-margin large office equipment compared with lower-margin desktop devices.Shares in Xerox fell more than 6 per cent to $13.20 at the close of trade on Monday.Most of Xerox’s lay-offs will be in technical support services and manufacturing supply chains in Europe and North America. The restructuring will result in total charges this year of $200m after tax, as announced in an SEC filing last month.About 1,800 jobs were cut in the second quarter and another 800 will be shed this year.IT hardware maker Hewlett-Packard; photography group Kodak; and Kimberly-Clark, maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, last week announced job cuts totalling more than 30,000.Weaker margins have plagued Xerox in the last several quarters as the company shifts its mix of products and rolls out new digital technology.Larry Zimmerman, chief financial officer, said there was a slower than expected start to some key products such as the Nuvera, a black-and-white digital photocopier.“But it’s a long-term product. It shouldn’t be judged by three months, but over a long time. We want to get it right as we install this,” he said.Anne Mulcahy, chief executive, said: “These equipment sales will drive future post-sale gains, and, at the same time, we’re adjusting our business model to respond to the resulting pressure on margins.”Xerox said total revenue increased 2 per cent to $3.9bn, but would have remained flat if not for a boost from favourable exchange rates. Colour was one of its bright spots, with revenue from those products 17 per cent higher in the second quarter.The company launched 24 new office products last month as it competes fiercely with rivals such as Canon, HP and Ricoh.Xerox said total revenue increased 2 per cent to $3.9bn, but would have remained flat if not for a boost from favourable exchange rates. Revenue from colour products grew 17 per cent in the second quarter.Xerox warned of potentially weaker results in third quarter, but said it expected improvement in fourth quarter as new products take off and it begins to see the benefits of restructuring.”This performance will keep us within the range of our full-year guidance, most likely in the low end of the range,” said Ms Mulcahy.The latest news is a stumbling block in Xerox’s recovery since it pulled back from the brink of bankruptcy in 2000. From 2001, Ms Mulcahy oversaw a sweeping two-year restructuring that called for nearly 30,000 lay-offs, an aggressive transition to digital while phasing out old analogue technology, and focus on high-growth areas such as colour technology."
124;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2005-07-24T19:27:43Z;Oil prices pump up costs;;As rising oil prices bite, international manufacturers are finding innovative and sometimes painful ways of coping with the impact on their raw material and energy bills.As the impact of increasing costs ripples through the supply chain, companies can feel the pinch in almost any industry.The most dramatic example came on Friday when Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, announced 6,000 job cuts to offset the rising cost of paper fibres and resin used in plastic packaging.Both commodities are heavily influenced by the price of oil and their increasing cost in the second quarter almost entirely wiped out $55m of savings the company had tried to find from other areas.Days earlier, International Paper was forced to rip apart its business model and put $8bn-$10bn worth of assets up for sale in response to a price squeeze of its own.The world's second-largest private landowner is a major harvester of the wood pulp that produces tissue and nappy fibres, but it has suffered from the rising price of production chemicals and transport costs also associated with oil.Though some of this inflation can be passed on to customers in the way Kimberly-Clark experienced, much cannot, and International Paper has had to take tough decisions about which markets it can afford to stay in.Elsewhere, manufacturers representing a range of sectors from Whirlpool in home appliances to United Technologies in air conditioning and Kraft in the food industry, all made similar warnings last week about the impact rising commodity costs were having on profits.“It's a shock to the system for anyone who makes products with metals or plastic and who has logistics costs,” said Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool chairman.It would be wrong to assume that such complaints represent a crisis for manufacturing. For many companies, pricing power does still allow them to pass on rising raw material costs.Clayt Daley, finance director of Procter & Gamble, said: “I think we are in an environment right now where you can raise prices to recover commodities that are affecting your industry. We have done it. In most cases, but not all, the competition has chosen to raise prices as well.”General Electric, the world's largest manufacturer, also said it was managing to stay ahead of commodity cost inflation in markets such as plastics that have often looked to be most vulnerable of all.To some extent, commodity inflation is one of those challenges to industry that helps sort the men from the boys. Companies with strong brands or disciplined management can weather the storm far better than those in weak market positions.But there are lessons for all businesses in the way manufacturers have managed to cope.In P&G's case, it is increasingly turning to financial hedging as a way of smoothing out the volatility of raw material costs. The consumer goods group buys little crude oil itself, but is looking at ways to hedge the cost of products further down the petrochemicals stream such as the resins that go into bottles and packaging.Koch Industries, a privately held industrial and oil trading group based in Kansas, confirmed it was in discussions with P&G about offering risk management products for such plastics.Thomas Falk, chief executive of Kimberly-Clark, said it too was looking at insulating itself from volatility in the price of fibres, probably by using the recently-created pulp futures contracts at the New York Board of Trade.Of course, hedging can only offer a temporary cushion. The reason that oil prices are beginning to bite is not just that they are up 40 per cent from a year ago, but because they have stayed high for several quarters.Companies such as Honey-well believe continuous productivity improvement, even in boom times, is the only way to prepare for unexpected price shocks. It recently announced 2,000 job cuts in its aerospace division even though business is doing well and pricing power has allowed it to pass on higher raw material costs.“It's easier to do this with the wind at our back,” said David Anderson, Honey-well's finance director.Most important, the rising cost of energy is not yet enough to cause significant changes in the behaviour of end consumers.Petrol prices in the US, for example, are still far below the inflation-adjusted peaks of the 1970s, and few economists expect drivers to stop filling their tanks for the sake of few dollars extra that would otherwise barely cover the cost of coffee at Starbucks.Valero, the largest independent oil refiner in the US, said the only change it had seen in consumer behaviour was that some drivers were choosing to fill up with regular rather than premium products at the pump.Doug Duncan, chief executive of FedEx Freight, the trucking division of FedEx delivery group, described how many customers were choosing to send less urgent packages by road rather than air to minimise fuel surcharges.As long as consumers remain relatively resilient, most manufacturers and industrial suppliers so far seem able to cope with oil's cost squeeze.
125;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2005-07-22T17:16:58Z;Kimberly-Clark to cut 6,000 jobs as profit dips;;"Kimberly-Clark, maker of Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues, on Friday joined the ranks of US companies shedding jobs this week by saying it would cut 10 per cent of its workforce and close or sell 20 manufacturing plants.The move comes in response to rising commodity and energy costs and intensified competition with rival Procter & Gamble, which is acquiring razor blade maker Gillette for $57bn.The restructuring involves 6,000 jobs, bringing to 30,500 the total losses this week after photography group Eastman-Kodak said it would shed 10,000 people, and Hewlett-Packard unveiled 14,500 job cuts.Thomas Falk, chief executive, said the company was taking action because while sales had grown, the company's margins had not.""We're doing it now from a position of strength,"" he told the Financial Times. ""We've been achieving our plan with the notable exception of our profit margins so this allows us to stay on the front foot while have the momentum going from a [sales] volume standpoint.""Kimberly-Clark, founded in 1872 as a maker of newsprint, said cost savings of $55m achieved in the second quarter were almost completely wiped out by higher costs for fibres used in nappies and resin used in plastic packaging.It said it would take a charge of $775m for the workforce reduction, which would be completed by 2008. It expected to save $350m through all restructuring actions by 2009.Amy Low Chasen, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: ""This shows management is aggressively taking action to fix its businesses. This is a major and welcome change from recent years.""The Dallas-based company would also accelerate research and development spending by 50 per cent over 2004 levels to $400m annually by 2009.It would also push more rapidly into the key developing markets of Brazil, Russia, India, China, Indonesia and Turkey.Such countries account for only 4 per cent of current Kimberly-Clark sales, but contain about half the world's population.Developing markets are emerging as the key battleground for P&G, Unilever and Kimberly-Clark as they seek new consumers and battle shrinking margins in home markets.Kimberly-Clark also reported second-quarter profit fell to $421.8m, or 88 cents per share, from $454.3m, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier. But before one-time charges, the company earned 95 cents per share.Its shares were 1.9 per cent higher by early afternoon in New York at $64.04."

127;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;SSL lifted by Durex condom sales;;SSL International said it expected annual operating profits to exceed last year amid strong sales of its Scholl footcare products and surging Durex condom sales.The UK group, which has been mooted as a bid target for large consumer goods groups such as Reckitt Benckiser and Kimberly-Clark, said increased sales from its consumer business were helping to generate strong gross margins.As a result ?this, taken together with overhead cost reductions?, was expected to lead to underlying operating profits ?well ahead of last year?s ?26.1m and consistent with out stated target to doubling operating profits over the three years to March 2007,? the company said.In a trading update, SSL said its Durex and Scholl footcare sales, its main revenue drivers, had increased by 4 and 5 per cent respectively. New product launches and effective advertising campaigns for Pleasuremax condoms and Scholl Party Feet helped boost sales. But SSL admitted those gains were offset by a decline in revenues of Scholl shoes as it disposed of less profitable styles.The group, which last year sold its antiseptics and surgical gloves business to a management team backed by Apax for ?173m, has focused heavily in its footcare and condom products, last year cutting its final dividend by 50 per cent to fund expansion of its Durex condom and Dr Scholl footcare brands. SSL said on Thursday that it would continue to focus on high value products but was till going through aIt said on Thursday that it also expected sales of its unbranded condoms to rise to about ?41m.For the year to March 31 2005 the group said reported sales in its consumer business were expected to exceed ?420m, about 4 per cent ahead of the previous year when the consolidation of its Indian business and currency movements were taken into account. SSL?s branded consumer business, meanwhile, should see sales of about ?370m, up 2 per cent on an underlying basis.One analyst said that while the Durex and Scholl footcare brands appeared to be performing in line with expectations, the underlying trend was disappointing and the group still had work to do turn round its Scholl sandals business.?If you delve deeper, it is not clear how much of the business has benefitted from walking away from unprofitable businesses and how much is about losing market share,? another analyst said.Analysts said the group appeared to be hedging its bets by offering a three-year window in which to double profits and that a clear picture of where the group was going was not likely to emerge until the full-year results are released on May 24.Seb Jantet at Investec, said there was an element of ?bid speculation? which was keeping the share price artificially high but that it was unclear whether any bids for SSL would materialise.Reckitt, a previous contender, is now thought more likely to bid for the over-the-counter medicine business of Boots, which the UK health and beauty retailer put up for sale earlier this month. And analysts believe SSL?s business may still be ?too messy? for other players to consider despite recent disposals.In December, fraud charges against Iain Cater, former chief executive of SSL International, the maker of Durex condoms, and two other SSL executives were dismissed. The other two defendants against whom charges have been dismissed are Dieno George and Paul Sanders.The company is due to publish preliminary results for the year on .The shares were up ?p at 294?p in late morning trade.
128;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;S Korean groups nurture skills to meet China threat;;On his days off, Shin Hyun-chul goes back to work. A machine operator for Yuhan-Kimberly, South Korea's largest nappy and toilet paper maker, Mr Shin joins hundreds of his colleagues in returning to the Kunpo factory outside working hours to study new technology, learn computer skills and watch safety films.As cheap labour from China threatens manufacturers' competitiveness across the Yellow Sea, YK, which is 70 per cent owned by Kimberly-Clark of the US, has become something of a corporate revolutionary.In spite of South Korea's notoriously inflexible labour market, militant unions and long working hours, YK has instituted a four-days-on, four-days-off schedule in which employees work up to 12 hours a day but fewer hours overall. Furthermore, they can choose to study on days off for extra pay.“I am working 12 hours for four days but it doesn't make me very tired because I take four days off,” says Mr Shin, who has worked at YK for 13 years. “And we have lifelong learning classes twice a month and it's satisfying to learn something new.”YK was forced to think anew not only by increased competition from China but also by rapidly falling nappy sales in South Korea, where the birth rate has slumped. Instead of trying to maintain its margins by cutting staff numbers and costs, the company took a counter-intuitive approach.“We have increased the number of crews operating from three to four,” says Moon Kook-hyun, YK's chief executive. “That lets our workers rest more, be healthier, and study more about new technology and new trends. We have seen big improvements in safety, productivity and quality.”The company's workforce has expanded from 1,400 in 1997 to 1,700 but, instead of employees working more than 50 hours a week, they now work a maximum of 42 hours and spend an average of 300 hours a year in classes covering everything from work-related technology to Chinese language and internet training.The changes have tripled capacity at YK's factories, which are now operating every day of the year compared with a maximum of 270 days before. Net income has risen almost 18-fold in the past 10 years and, although profits are likely to remain about Won9bn ($10m) this year, that is in the face of a 10-20 per cent reduction in domestic sales.Labour costs account for about 15 per cent of YK's expenses, and about a quarter of that amount is spent on its lifelong learning programmes. But it is money well spent, Mr Moon says. “Employee satisfaction and safety have greatly improved, and we are making real productivity gains, and that will help us keep our competitive edge,” he says.The approach might be mocked in more traditional business environments but YK's unconventional practices have generated a fan club in South Korea, even spawning a book.They are based on a concept from the New Paradigm Centre, part of the non-profit Korea Labour Institute. “When enterprises adopt the new paradigm system, their labour costs increase and that makes lots of CEOs hesitate. But other costs like land, capital and machinery can be saved,” says Shin Bong-ho, head of the centre and economics professor at Seoul City University. “Eventually it helps the companies and the country much more.”The “old paradigm” of overworking was based on low-cost labour, he adds. “But the international environment is changing. Unlike driving on a flat street, we have to choose the proper driving mode for a slope,” Prof Shin says.Other Korean companies are beginning to follow in YK's footsteps. Pulmuone, a mid-sized food company, introduced a similar system at its Choongbuk tofu factory in July. The scheme is working so well it plans to implement it at its other plants within two years.“We were especially concerned about education because our first goal is training employees and raising their quality of life,” says Yu In-taek of Pulmuone. “We expect to improve our working culture and raise the quality of our products by training employees.”Kookmin Bank, South Korea's largest lender, has also adopted the lifelong education concept, saying continuous study is the source of competitiveness. “We are strengthening our employees' abilities and their concentration on their work is increased by balancing work and life,” says Kookmin's Choi In-suk.Such attitudes will help South Korea keep the threat of China at bay, says YK's Mr Moon.“To keep ahead, we should move towards a knowledge-based rather than a labour-intensive economy,” he says. “In every sense, China is bigger than Korea, so we can't continue to enjoy the advantage we had up until the late 1980s.”
129;KMB;Kimberly-Clark Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
