0;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2019-05-07T21:46:24Z;Electronic Arts lifted by new ‘battle royale’ games;Fortnite rivals help the Fifa video game maker beat sales forecasts;Electronic Arts recorded stronger sales than expected as it cashed in on the popularity of “battle royale” games, allaying investors’ worries over Fortnite competition.EA said Tuesday net bookings for the March quarter were up 8.7 per cent year-over-year to $1.36bn, handily beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.2bn.Shares in the video game company surged 6.8 per cent in after-hours trading.“Players are engaging with games in more ways than ever before. We’re committed to meeting them where they are with a broad portfolio of amazing new games and live services, choice of engagement models including free-to-play and subscriptions, and new opportunities to play, compete and watch,” chief executive Andrew Wilson said in a statement.Video game makers are facing growing competition from free-to-play games such as Fortnite, which are increasingly winning over players and pressuring sales of traditional console games. Some of the industry’s top names, including EA, Take-Two Interactive and Call of Duty-maker Activision Blizzard, issued downbeat sales forecasts in February.EA recently cheered investors with the rapid success of its own “battle royale”-style game — a format in which players fight each other until only one remains. Respawn Entertainment, the EA unit behind Apex Legends, said 50m users signed up to play in the first month following its February 4 launch. Epic Games said in March that Fortnite had 250m registered users.EA also launched Battlefield V Firestorm, a “battle royale” mode of its popular war franchise, and online multiplayer game Anthem during the latest quarter.The Redwood City, California-based company, also known for iconic sports titles Madden NFL and Fifa, reported net income of $209m, or 69 cents a share, in its fiscal fourth quarter, down from $607m, or $1.95 a share.For the current quarter, EA projected net bookings of $690m, weaker than the $807.8m forecast by analysts. Net bookings for the year are seen hitting $5.1bn, compared to a consensus estimate of $5.16bn.Also on Tuesday, EA announced plans to expand its EA Access subscription service to Sony’s PlayStation 4 in July. It is currently available on Microsoft’s Xbox and PCs.
1;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2019-02-11T16:45:28Z;Electronic Arts’ Fortnite rival powers stock;Analyst calls Apex Legends the ‘hottest new game in years’ from EA.;Electronic Arts may be beating Fortnite at its own game.Investors are cheering early success for Apex Legends, a free-to-play, “battle royale”-style game aimed squarely at the popular Fortnite. Respawn Entertainment, the EA unit behind Apex Legends, announced on Friday that the game drew more than 10m players and surpassed 1m concurrent players within the first 72 hours after its launch.Jefferies analyst Timothy O’Shea called Apex Legends, which arrived on February 4 in a surprise debut, the “hottest new game in years” from EA.“While too early to determine its staying power, first week data is strong,” Mr O’Shea, who raised his price target for EA shares by $10 to $90, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch also offered an upbeat reaction to EA’s first free “battle royale” game, upgrading the stock to “buy” from “neutral” and raising their price target to $110.EA shares surged more than 16 per cent on Friday, their best single-day gain in more than four years. The move added about $4bn to EA’s market capitalisation. Shares continued to rally on Monday following the upbeat analyst comments, rising 6.7 per cent in mid-morning trade.The rally more than clawed back losses from a sharp sell-off early last week that was sparked by weaker than expected revenue forecasts from both EA and Take-Two Interactive, which makes Grand Theft Auto. Free-to-play games such as Fornite are increasingly winning over players and pressuring sales of console games. Fortnite generated $2.4bn in revenue in 2018, according to SuperData, and had more than 200m registered players as of November.Based on Fortnite revenue figures, Mr O’Shea estimated that Apex Legends could generate around $300m in high-margin revenues. He also noted that marketing costs were likely near zero, while other blockbuster games have had marketing budgets of at least $50m.Online chatter about the game is much more positive than negative, based on data from analytics group Spiketrap, and Fortnite viewership on Twitch, the Amazon-owned live video platform, was “basically chopped in half” between the afternoon of Apex Legends’ launch and the following day, he said.Vince Zampella, CEO of Respawn, wrote last week that “never in our wildest dreams could we have expected the outpouring of support and positivity we’ve seen.”
2;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2019-02-05T22:17:46Z;Game makers’ shares hit in battle royale with ‘Fortnite’;Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive deliver disappointing sales forecasts;Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive delivered disappointing sales forecasts amid stiff competition from the likes of Fortnite, sending shares of the video-game makers and their peers tumbling on Wednesday.Traditional video game developers have faced a growing threat from online and mobile games that are increasingly winning over players. Epic Games, creator of Fortnite, said in November the free-to-play “battle royale” game had more than 200m players with registered accounts.EA was also dealt a blow in the December quarter when it delayed the release of Battlefield V by about a month to November 20. The company said it sold 7.3m copies of Battlefield V during the fiscal third period, about 1m fewer than hoped. In December, Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Take-Two’s Red Dead Redemption 2 and Activision Blizzard’s Call of Duty: Black Ops IIII outsold Battlefield V, according to NPD.“Our launch didn’t resonate as strongly as we would have liked it to with players, and we were never truly able to catch up. And as our competitors continued to build momentum, whether that was Fortnite or Red Dead Redemption 2 or Call of Duty, we continued to stall from where we needed to be,” EA chief executive Andrew Wilson said on an earnings call.California-based EA cut its outlook for full-year net revenue to $4.87bn from $5.15bn. It also projected net bookings of $1.17bn in the March quarter, while analysts were looking for $1.47bn, according to FactSet.Take-Two said its fourth-quarter net bookings were expected within a range of $450m to $500m, falling short of analysts’ average estimate of $609m.Shares in EA slipped 13 per cent, while Take-Two Interactive lost 10 per cent of its value in early trading in New York. The downbeat forecasts also sideswiped shares in Activision Blizzard, which were down 9 per cent, and Ubisoft, which fell 9 per cent in Europe.The success of Red Dead Redemption 2 helped Take-Two, also known for Grand Theft Auto, register stronger earnings and sales than expected during the holiday quarter. Net bookings more than doubled to $1.57bn.Take-Two chief executive Strauss Zelnick, when asked about Fortnite, told analysts that he was “not worried at all about someone else establishing a free-to-play approach”.“We get competition from every form of entertainment and other activities that people engage in that take them away from consuming our titles,” Mr Zelnick said. “I don’t believe for a minute that our results when they’re great, or our results when they’re less than great, are being influenced positively or negatively by another hit title in the marketplace. It’s just not the way entertainment works.”EA, the company behind the Fifa and Madden NFL franchises, launched its own “battle royale” game in Apex Legends on Monday to compete with Fortnite and similar games. EA also noted a 15 per cent increase year over year in the number of Fifa Ultimate Team matches played during the quarter.Growth in digital drove an 11 per cent increase in EA’s third-quarter net revenue to $1.29bn. Net bookings, however, dropped 18 per cent to $1.61bn, missing analysts’ expectations for $1.75bn.Net income was $262m, or 86 cents a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $186m, or 60 cents a share. Analysts were looking for earnings per share of 73 cents, according to a Refinitiv poll.
3;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2018-10-05T17:18:23Z;Nike expresses concern over Ronaldo rape claim;Sponsors issue statements after allegation against football star;Pressure is building on Cristiano Ronaldo after a rape allegation made against him became public, leading to key sponsors expressing their concern and the football star pulling out of upcoming matches for the Portuguese national team.Earlier this week, police in Nevada reopened a criminal investigation over a complaint made by a local woman that Ronaldo raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room nine years ago. He has vehemently denied the allegations.Lawyers for the woman, Kathryn Mayorga, held a press conference on Wednesday to confirm an earlier report by German magazine Der Spiegel, suggesting she had first made the accusation to police in June 2009, but had remained silent after receiving $375,000 in an out-of-court settlement.Ms Mayorga’s lawyers suggested the deal was invalid for a number of reasons, including that such settlements are not allowed to conceal a criminal act.Nike and Electronic Arts, two of the player’s sponsors, took the rare step of issuing statements of disquiet over the matter, but have maintained their commercial links.Nike said: “We are deeply concerned by the disturbing allegations and will continue to closely monitor the situation.”Reports suggest that Ronaldo is one of the few athletes to have a lifetime deal with Nike, alongside the likes of basketball players Michael Jordan and LeBron James. Sponsors often include morality clauses in their contracts, allowing them to end deals if a sportsperson’s personal conduct proves damaging.Ronaldo is the cover star of Fifa football, one of the world’s bestselling video games. Its maker, Electronic Arts, said it was “closely monitoring the situation”, adding that athletes it endorsed were expected to “conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with EA’s values”.Ronaldo has many personal sponsorship deals, including with watchmaker Tag Heuer and Cairo-based metals group Egyptian Steel. Through his personal brand “CR7”, he has launched a line of fragrances, footwear, luxury underwear and blankets. His personal sponsorship deals were worth $47m in the year to June 2018, according to Forbes.Fernando Santos, Portugal’s head coach, expressed support for the player, but added that following conversations with Ronaldo, he would not represent his national side again until next year.In July, he signed for Italian club Juventus, which paid a €100m transfer fee to Spain’s Real Madrid, while giving the footballer a four-year contract that provides a salary worth more than €50m a year after tax.Juventus signed Ronaldo in the belief that his international profile will help the club secure global sponsorship deals that could help transform it into the world’s richest club.In a statement on Twitter, Juventus said: “Cristiano Ronaldo has shown in recent months his great professionalism and dedication, which is appreciated by everyone at Juventus.“The events allegedly dating back to almost 10 years ago do not change this opinion, which is shared by anyone who has come into contact with this great champion.”Juventus’s share price has fallen close to 19 per cent over the course of the week.Ronaldo said in a statement on Twitter: “I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in. Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense.“My clear conscious [sic] will thereby allow me to await with tranquillity the results of any and all investigations.”
4;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2018-08-30T13:21:11Z;Video game maker EA cuts billings outlook after Battlefield delay;;Video game maker Electronic Arts on Thursday cut its net bookings forecast and announced it would be pushing back the launch of the newest installation in its popular Battlefield series.EA updated its net bookings guidance for fiscal 2019 to $5.20bn from $5.55bn, noting that $115m of that shift was driven by moves in foreign exchange rates.The release date for the newest Battlefield game, Battlefield V, has been pushed back four weeks to November 20, meaning some of the money expected from the game will now hit the ledger in fiscal 2020. The game was previously supposed to come out on October 19, with an open beta version going live September 4.Shares dropped 6.3 per cent in pre-market trading on the heels of the news. Coming into Thursday trading, EA was up 22 per cent year-to-date.On Sunday three people were killed in a mass shooting in Jacksonville, Florida during a tournament featuring EA’s Madden football game. On Wednesday, EA announced it was donating $1m to support the families of the victims of the event.
5;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2018-08-15T16:11:56Z;US video game stocks hit by Tencent woes and China red tape;;Shares in US video game makers sank on Wednesday, following Asian counterparts lower amid media reports that authorities in China, the world’s biggest gaming market, had halted approvals for new mobile games as the sector undergoes a broader bureaucratic overhaul.The regulatory unease weighed on profits and shares of China’s Tencent, the world’s biggest video game maker. Tencent carries a large weighting in both the Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and emerging markets indices, adding to the geopolitical concerns already afflicting EM assets.An estimated 3,000 titles have been awaiting approval for commercial launch since March, when China overhauled the government bodies that oversee the $38bn industry there. Even though consumers are able to play the new games, developers have been unable to make money from them.Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that China had stopped approving new mobile games as part of its reform of the market. Approvals for online, console and mobile games have been stalled for months owing to the overhaul of government agencies.That political roadblock contributed to a rare drop in profit for Tencent, the world’s biggest video game maker, during the quarter. Beijing this week ordered the company to halt sales of a video game, Monster Hunter: World, just days after it was released. Tencent’s Hong Kong-listed shares ended Wednesday 3.4 per cent lower ahead of the release of the results.“It’s worth noting that Tencent is a widely held security within ETFs, particularly the [iShares MSCI Emerging Markets] and [iShares China FTSE/Shinhua 25 Index] ETFs, which should be effected [sic] by the negative earnings report,” wrote strategists at Cantor Fitzgerald.Douglas Morton, head of Research Asia at Northern Trust Capital Markets, wrote: “In a market highly sensitive to downside sentiment, today’s Tencent result could prove a fresh (and entirely uncorrelated) catalyst for continued Emerging Market pressure in our opinion, given their position alongside Baidu and Alibaba of making up one-tenth of the MSCI EM by market cap.”In the US on Wednesday, shares in Electronic Arts were down 3.2 per cent, Activision Blizzard was down 3.1 per cent and Take-Two Interactive fell 2.2 per cent. The S&P 500 was down 1 per cent.The disappointment with Tencent’s result and broader EM concerns weighed on US-listed China stocks, with ecommerce sites Alibaba and JD.com down 3.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively, while search engine company Baidu fell 2.5 per cent.On Wednesday in Japan, Nintendo closed 3 per cent lower, Capcom — maker of the Monster Hunter series — was down 2.7 per cent. Konami was down 4.2 per cent.
6;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2018-05-26T04:00:27Z;‘Fortnite’ shakes up gaming with all the best moves;Teens are hooked by the battle royale format and ubiquity on smartphones;An obscure Japanese horror film is the unlikely inspiration for the latest pop-cultural phenomenon. In Battle Royale, a sadistic teacher drops an unruly class of teenagers on an island. They are forced to set aside their cliques and crushes to kill each other with whatever weapons they can find, until only one is left alive.Eighteen years on, that grungy movie has spawned a Day-Glo offspring: the video game Fortnite. It pits 100 players against one another in a cartoony mix of Minecraft and Call of Duty. Fortnite has attracted tens of millions of players in Europe and the US because it is a more fun and accessible take on the familiar shooter-game genre. Weeks-long “seasons” bring in new features and twists, from tie-ins to Marvel’s latest Avengers movie to jetpack power-ups.Traditional multiplayer games can be intimidating to newbies but in Fortnite, nobody can buy better weapons for an unfair advantage. Money can only be used on new outfits and accessories. Players are also allocated a character at random, with no way at first to change gender or skin colour. That is credited with helping it attract more female players than usual.Fortnite’s success also lies in its ubiquity. Instead of being confined to PCs or PlayStations, players can compete on iPhones and iPads too. Such “cross platform” play is still unusual for online multiplayer games. Players can swap tips, build bases and set traps while sitting alongside each other in real life, as well as on sites like Reddit. Critics may complain about smartphones making us “alone together” but Fortnite shows that technology can foster real-world community, too.The “you against the world” format of battle royale makes it more accessible than traditional games, says Nick Fajt, who heads the studio behind virtual reality game Rec Room. It is now incorporating Fortnite’s 100-player deathmatch mode. “The odds are stacked steeply against every player,” says Mr Fajt. “If you win, it feels like an incredible achievement, something that’s really worth bragging about. If you lose, no big deal, so did 98 other people.”Fortnite may be about killing everyone else, but it is also about teamwork, dressing up and victory dances — especially the dancing. Its developers, US company Epic Games, drew inspiration for the game’s celebratory, pre-programmed “emotes” from online memes and “vintage” television shows such as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Scrubs. Now, Fortnite dances such as the Floss are showing up on YouTube and in football players’ goal celebrations.Part of Epic’s success may be due to the fact it is based in Cary, North Carolina, rather than Silicon Valley. The town of 160,000 was previously best known for its Lazy Daze Arts & Crafts Festival. While the big tech giants stumbled around seeking the next big thing after the smartphone, including VR headsets and “augmented reality” glasses, Epic stole a march.Fortnite’s sudden rise is rattling much larger games companies. Executives at Electronic Arts, creators of the Fifa football simulators and Battlefield shooters, protested on a recent earnings call that they had not seen a “giant impact” from players switching to Fortnite. Still, the impact was apparently big enough for EA to add Epic to its list of top competitors in this week’s annual report. Activision Blizzard, the US’ largest games publisher, has said it plans to incorporate the battle royale format into existing games including Call of Duty.Epic is trying to stay ahead of the copycats. This week, it pledged to create a $100m “prize pot” for competitive Fortnite matches, dwarfing prizes handed out at existing esports tournaments.Fortnite has already become a spectator sport, breaking records on streaming sites including YouTube and Twitch, which specialises in gaming. The pool of potential players has never been larger: more than 2bn people carry a smartphone and 1.5bn people regularly tune in to YouTube. This shift has been building quietly for years. Amazon paid $1bn for Twitch in 2014 and some of YouTube’s most popular stars play and talk about video games. Fortnite’s fans include rapper Drake, and it has minted new celebrities such as the pink-haired star player Ninja.Fortnite is the long-awaited High School Musical of gaming: witty, approachable and with the best dance moves. To that zombie-like gamer stereotype of surly boys hiding in darkened bedrooms, it takes a well-aimed, and long-awaited, shot to the head.tim.bradshaw@ft.com
7;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Esports: virtual gains;Epic Games is set to provide $100m in prizes for its popular ‘Fortnite Battle Royale’;Being paid to play computer games sounds like a teenager’s dream. Esports have made it real — thanks to millions of global fans who want to watch professional gamers in action. The rise of video game tournaments threatens to upend the profitability of traditional game publishers.Esports attract 300m followers who regularly watch competitive events — a figure that consultancy Newzoo expects to double in five years.High viewing figures attract sponsorship — $500m in 2017 according to Newzoo — raising player winnings. Epic Games said this week it would provide $100m in prizes for its popular Fortnite Battle Royale. Sponsorship, media rights, in-game purchases and tickets make free-to-play games lucrative. Fortnite generated about $300m in revenues for its owner Epic Games, in which Tencent has a stake, in April alone.Playing Fortnite leaves less time for the other games, which rely on sales of software. Shares in Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard both dipped in April as Fortnite became a global phenomenon.Competitors are wise to be moving in on esports. More than 11bn esports videos were streamed last year in China. Fans are usually young men who follow non-virtual sporting events too. That gives an edge to video games makers such as Electronic Arts. Its Fifa football game has spawned its own esport events.Tencent dominates for now — with Fortnite and League of Legends. Activision Blizzard is building up its offer. Nintendo is late but catching up.

8;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2018-01-30T22:09:55Z;EA jumps on strong revenue growth in 2017;December quarter revenue on the soft side, though;Shares in Electronic Arts jumped in after-hours trade after the video-game maker reported solid revenue growth during the 2017 calendar year.However, the company lowered its profit forecast and also revealed a highly anticipated Star Wars game sold fewer copies than expected during the company’s third quarter.EA said total revenue for the 12 months ended December 31 rose 10.1 per cent to $5.1bn. That took some of the attention away from the 1 per cent year-on-year rise in third-quarter revenue to $1.16bn.The company reported a net loss of $186m in the three months ended December 31, weighed down by a $176m of expenses due to the application of US tax legislation. A year ago, the company reported a $1m loss.For its financial year ended March 31, EA expects net revenue to be $5.15bn, which includes deferred net revenue from online-enabled games, unchanged from its previous forecast at the end of the September quarter.Net income is now expected to be $1.015bn, down from its forecast of $1.136bn three months ago.During its conference call, chief financial officer Andrew Wilson said Star Wars Battlefront II sold 7m copies during the December quarter, 1m below EA’s forecast.Shares were up 3.8 per cent in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq.
9;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2018-01-26T17:43:48Z;EA announces multiyear esports deal with NFL, ESPN, Disney;First long-term, multiyear esports broadcast agreement;Electronic Arts has announced big plans for its Madden NFL 18 video game, with a multiyear deal with the National Football League, ESPN and Disney XD to broadcast the final rounds of a tournament based around the popular title.Branded by the quartet in a statement on Friday as the first long-term multi-event competitive gaming network agreement, the tie-up comes at a time of ballooning interest in so-called esports, video game tournaments for professionals and amateurs that are drawing big audiences and prize money.According to Friday’s announcement, league matches will be broadcast from January 26 this year through to the championship final at the start of May.Last year, ESPN and EA collaborated in something of a one-off to televise tournaments based on the latter’s popular Fifa football title. The Walt Disney-owned broadcaster has stepped up coverage of other esports tournaments based on other video games.Activision Blizzard, EA’s rival and the world’s largest game publisher, has also made a big push around esports, and last year drummed up interest around its Overwatch fantasy shooter game.
10;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2017-10-31T21:09:18Z;Electronic Arts shares slip as sales outlook comes up shy;;Shares of Electronic Arts, maker of the Fifa and Madden NFL video games, were sent lower after it delivered revenue outlook for the holiday quarter that was a touch shy of analysts’ estimates and a wider-than-expected quarterly loss.Shares in the California-based company fell more than 3 per cent to $115.81 after it said it expects adjusted revenue of about $2bn in the three months ending in December. That was just shy of analysts’ estimates of $2.01bn.In its fiscal second quarter, the company said its loss narrowed to $22m or 7 cents a share, compared with $38m or 13 cents a share in the year-ago period. Analysts had forecast a loss of 4 cents, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.Revenues rose nearly 7 per cent to $959m, driven by the company’s sports titles. Sales in its high-margin digital business jumped from $566m in the year-ago quarter to $689m in the three months ended in September. Adjusted sales of $1.18bn were in line with Wall Street estimates.“We saw a notable shift to digital in our sports titles and remarkable growth in Ultimate Team,” finance chief Blake Jorgensen said. “Our sports titles have once again shown their value in delivering a stable and dependable performance. This quarter demonstrates how they can drive our business and offers a window into how our games will evolve over the months and years to come.”Electronic Arts shares are up nearly 50 per cent so far this year.
11;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2017-06-16T17:35:43Z;Angry Birds maker could launch initial public offering;Rovio suggests potential listing despite reports of possible Tencent bid;Finnish gaming company Rovio could launch Angry Birds on to the stock market, amid reports that Chinese internet group Tencent is preparing a bid for the business.“We and our shareholders regularly assess different alternatives to further develop the company,” said a spokesperson for the maker of the hit game. “A stock exchange listing at some point in the future could be possible in order to support the continued strong growth of the company and its strategic targets.”Angry Birds was one of the first hit games of the smartphone era, but Rovio struggled to sustain its success as consumers moved away from paid-for apps to freemium games, which charged users for extra tools. Rival titles including King’s Candy Crush Saga and Supercell’s Clash of the Clans proved more addictive.Rovio eventually moved away from conventional gaming into entertainment, producing branded toys, candy, children’s playground equipment and a Hollywood film based on the characters that was an unexpected commercial success. Last year, the success of the movie boosted its gaming division which reported revenues of €159m, up from €113m the previous year.Rovio declined to comment on any potential deal with Tencent, which already has a foothold in the Finnish gaming market after it paid $8.6bn last year for a controlling stake in Supercell. The Information reported earlier this week that it is now exploring a $3bn takeover of Rovio.Richard Windsor, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said Tencent has been successful in turning Western games into Chinese hits but that the real opportunity for the Asian company was to build its presence outside of its home market, where it already dominates the gaming market.“Rovio is almost certainly past its prime but it has an asset that could be capitalised on should the right buyer come along,” he said. “Its ownership of Supercell makes Rovio a good strategic fit. This leaves the way open for Tencent to begin to build its assault on developed markets starting with the all-important segment of gaming which it dominates at home.”Tencent declined to comment.
12;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2017-06-11T23:41:27Z;Microsoft adds the One X factor in Sony console fight;Turbo-charged update to games unit in race to catch market-leading PS4;Microsoft has unveiled a turbo-charged update to its Xbox games console, the new One X, as it scrambles to catch up with market-leading PlayStation 4. When the new console goes on sale in November it will be both smaller and more powerful than the original Xbox One, which launched at the same time as Sony’s PS4 almost four years ago. Since then, the PS4 has outsold the Xbox by two-to-one, analysts estimate, with Sony’s console recently surpassing 60m units. Last year, Sony launched the PS4 Pro, offering souped-up 4K resolution and a faster processor to power extras such as its PlayStation VR headset. Three years in development, Microsoft’s response outperforms the PS4 Pro in sheer horsepower, claiming 6 teraflops of graphics compared with Sony’s 4.2 teraflops, and is capable of playing Blu-ray discs, a feature the latest PlayStation was criticised by some for lacking. The Xbox One X will also be $100 more expensive than the PS4 at $499. Existing Xbox One accessories and games will work with the new X model, Microsoft said in its press conference at the E3 games show in Los Angeles, where it showed off 22 forthcoming games launching exclusively on its consoles. Those ranged from zombie-filled horror, Lord of the Rings-inspired medieval battles, sci-fi shooters and a forthcoming Electronic Arts exclusive called Anthem. However, one feature absent from the Xbox One X at launch is support for virtual-reality headsets, which Microsoft has said will not arrive on the console until next year. Despite a slow start for many VR peripherals including Facebook’s Oculus Rift, Sony has sold more than 1m units of its PS VR headset to date. Microsoft …wants to regain the initiative with console enthusiasts that it lost way back at launchAt the same time as snapping up Nintendo’s brand-new Switch device, gaming fans have given a warm reception to supercharged versions of existing consoles. Sony said recently that one in five PS4s sold were its more expensive Pro model. These so-called “mid-cycle” updates show how games consoles are becoming more like PCs and smartphones, with more frequent incremental improvements instead of a completely new system, as Sony and Microsoft have traditionally launched every few years. “Consumer electronics today have a more rapid upgrade cycle in general. For consoles to stay competitive they need to iterate more significantly during the console lifecycle,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, analyst at IHS. “[Xbox One X] allows Microsoft to monetise its core Xbox audience mid-cycle and at a higher price point.” IHS forecasts the new Xbox will sell about 500,000 units in the fourth quarter of this year.“Sony’s sales lead and PS4 Pro strategy means that Microsoft needs to come to market with a different high-end proposition,” Mr Harding-Rolls said. “Microsoft has taken the logical step to hook its next console upgrade on the idea of delivering native 4K gaming. It wants to regain the initiative with console enthusiasts that it lost way back at launch.” Alongside the new Xbox, Microsoft also unveiled changes to Minecraft, the hugely popular world-building franchise it acquired in 2014 for $2.5bn. These included long-awaited cross-platform compatibility, allowing players to access their creations from Xbox, tablets and smartphones, Windows PCs and other consoles, including Nintendo’s Switch, via its Xbox Live network. Minecraft will also gain 4K support, bringing richer lighting and textures to its blocky, pixelated universe with what it called its “Super Duper Graphics Pack”. 
13;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2017-05-09T21:21:11Z;Video game maker EA posts 17% rise in quarterly revenues;;Electronic Arts, the publisher of video games like Fifa Soccer, Titanfall and The Sims, on Tuesday unveiled an almost 17 per cent rise in quarterly revenues, helped by its transition to digital sales.Revenues rose to $1.53bn in the quarter to the end of March, from $1.31bn in the same three-month period in the previous year. Adjusted revenues were $1.09bn, slightly shy of the $1.11bn that Wall Street analysts had forecast. Net income was down 37 per cent to $566m, largely due to income tax changes.While sales from traditional packaged disks were flat year-on-year, digital revenues grew 30 per cent to $934m. Digital net sales from its financial year ending in March made up 61 per cent of its total, up 20 per cent year-on-year, driven by the popularity of its Battlefield 1 shooting game and the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes mobile role-playing game.EA forecast net revenue for its fiscal 2018, ending in March next year, of $5.1bn, just short of Wall Street’s forecasts. Nonetheless, its shares were up 4 per cent after-hours as it guided its first quarter to net sales of around $750m.Its earnings forecast for the year was ahead of the marker set by analysts at $3.57 per share.
14;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2017-04-05T04:02:08Z;Nintendo and Sony lead charge as games consoles return to battle;Gaming apps fail to kill off a format that is being reinvented for a new generation;"Some pundits say sales of games consoles peaked with the dotcom boom. However, others believe rumours of their deaths have been greatly exaggerated as new concepts have helped to reinvigorate the format.Sony’s PlayStation 2, released in 2000 at the height of the market, holds the title of best-selling games console, with more than 150m units sold in just over a decade. Vying for the top spot is Nintendo’s handheld DS, which debuted in 2004. Despite two later versions of the PlayStation, and the release of competitors from Nintendo and Microsoft, no other console of the past 20 years has yet come close to either the PS2 or DS. In the meantime, the iPhone has sold 1bn units since its 2007 launch, with consumers now spending tens of billions of dollars a year on games.Piers Harding-Rolls, games analyst at IHS Markit, the research group, forecasts PlayStation 4 sales — at more than 53m since its 2013 release, according to Sony — could top those of the PS2 over its lifetime. He estimates sales will total 119m by 2021.Franchises from Pokémon to Final Fantasy are hopping from console to smartphone and back, with the games industry now able to address a larger audience of paying players thanks as much to puzzle-adventure game Candy Crush Saga as shoot-’em-up Call of Duty. Spending on console, mobile and PC games reached $100bn globally last year, up about $8bn on 2015 according to games intelligence provider Newzoo.No device epitomises that joined-up vision more than Nintendo’s new Switch, a “hybrid” console that combines a portable screen with big-display gaming when plugged into a TV. “The Switch is a complete redefinition of what it means to be a console,” says Mike Gallagher, chief executive of the Entertainment Software Association, the US games industry’s trade group. “The concept is very novel, very exciting and very different . . . It’s a great credit to [Nintendo] that they make this investment and take this risk.”Nintendo has tried to bridge the gap between consoles and tablets before, with the Wii U, launched in 2012, which was a disaster for the Japanese company. This featured a huge controller with an iPad-like touchscreen that has to be within range of a TV-tethered base station to work. It sold 13m units over its lifetime until January, far below the 100m units of its predecessor, the Wii.Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, the chipmaker that produces the Switch’s graphics processor, has said consumers will be “blown away” by the new device. “Nintendo . . . [is] singularly focused on making sure the gaming experience is amazing, surprising and safe for young people,” Mr Huang said at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.His implicit contrast was with smartphones and tablets, whose primary function is communication; games are just one of a phone’s many uses, which limits the opportunities for players. Mr Harding-Rolls says: “Consoles are still unique in providing a curated selection of games, [sophisticated] experiences, plug-and-play technology and are relatively cheap compared to a PC.”The Switch became Nintendo’s fastest-selling console in the US, Europe and Australia during its launch weekend in March. IHS Markit says it will help contribute to a predicted 4.1 per cent growth in the overall console market this year, which will take it to $36.2bn.Last year, however, the console market declined. With price cuts by Sony and Microsoft — and slowing demand for their PS4 and Xbox One consoles — the market fell by 2.5 per cent to $34.7bn in 2016 from the year before, IHS says. That came despite the launch of three much-anticipated virtual-reality headsets: the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR.VR has promised to reinvigorate the games industry by offering immersive experiences that place the player inside the game. So far, however, the market is taking off slowly. While the PS VR has shown early signs of success, thanks to its association with the PS4, the high costs of VR hardware and the powerful PCs required to run the Rift and Vive have deterred consumers.Jason Rubin, head of content at Facebook-owned Oculus, said in an interview at the Game Developers Conference in March that VR needed more content and lower prices to “shift into second gear”. So in March, less than a year after the headset first went on sale, Oculus cut the Rift’s price — and that of its accompanying Touch Controllers, which let players use their hands in virtual worlds — by 25 per cent to $598.To ensure more games are created to attract consumers, Mr Rubin said hardware companies such as Oculus will have to fund software developers upfront. Facebook has said it will invest $500m in VR content. But, for now, smaller independent developers dominate the Oculus game store rather than traditional console publishers such as Activision Blizzard or Electronic Arts, which are waiting to see if the medium takes off.Many in the industry remain optimistic about VR. IDC, the analyst group, predicts total headsets for VR and AR will reach 99.4m units by 2021, with a compound annual growth rate of 58 per cent between now and then.“Will VR get to tens or hundreds of millions of users? I think it will,” says Lisa Su, chief executive of chipmaker AMD, who hopes VR will spur demand for its new range of cheaper, yet powerful, processors. “As the price point becomes more affordable, that’s when the technology takes off.” Mobile app stores remain the biggest draw for games developers looking for a large market and low upfront costs. While the likes of Apple’s App Store has become overcrowded, with a few hits such as Clash of Clans or Pokémon Go scooping up a disproportionate amount of downloads and revenues, new mobile gaming businesses continue to emerge.The revenues of Scopely, a six-year-old mobile games publisher based in Los Angeles, grow eightfold between 2014 and 2016. Walter Driver, its chief executive, says the app market is a “totally different business model to traditional gaming, which was about one-time payments and relies on brand recognition. Now there are 2.5bn apps to try.”He adds: “Many companies started with a hit game but only a handful have done it again and again.” The company’s popular games include WWE Champions, based on the wrestling franchise, and The Walking Dead: Road to Survival, featuring characters from the zombie TV show and comics.“We are living in this arena of a massive ‘mainstreamification’ of gaming,” Mr Driver says. “It used to be a binary category — either you bought a console or you didn’t. Now mobile games appeal to a far broader audience.”That is proving profitable even though smartphone sales have also begun to slow. “A higher percentage of people are spending money on games, and the people who are spending money are spending more,” Mr Driver adds.Mr Harding-Rolls says that Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft will have to move beyond selling discs and into Netflix-style streaming services if console makers are to win over mobile gamers. Sony, for example, is offering the PlayStation Now games subscription service while using its console as a platform to leap into the video streaming market with PlayStation Vue — a package of live TV and movies that competes with US cable offerings. Set-top boxes for watching TV and films, such as Apple TV and Amazon’s Fire TV, are also becoming a means to play games.“The existential question is, what is a console?” asks ESA chief Mr Gallagher. “There are more platforms than ever with high amounts of computing power. We could see even more kinds of consoles than we have now.”"

The Texas-based company said profits slipped to $5.8m, or 12 cents a share, compared with $38.1m, or 75 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales fell 9 per cent to $659.8m.Analysts had forecast earnings of 15 cents a share, on sales of $667m.Fossil shares have plunged more than 74 per cent since the beginning of last year as consumers veer towards wearable devices such as the Apple Watch.“Weaker than expected [first-quarter] results showed that the watch craze has ended, department store sell-throughs are declining and technology shifts continue to disrupt the market,” said Randal Konik, an analyst at Jefferies.“All this points to a more difficult operating environment for Fossil, given its significant exposure to traditional watches.”The weakness in Fossil shares spread to other high-end names. Movado shares fell 10.5 per cent to $25.07, while Tiffany slid 6 per cent to $66.48. Michael Kors declined 11.8 per cent to $44.01.Elsewhere, Macy’s shares tumbled more than 15 per cent to $31.38 after the US department store chain cut its sales and earnings guidance for the year. That triggered a sell-off in rival department stores and retailers.Meanwhile, shares in Staples fell more than 18 per cent to $8.46 after a US judge on Tuesday ruled in favour of the Federal Trade Commission’s request for an injunction to halt a $6.3bn merger between the stationery retailer and Office Depot.The failed merger and weak results dragged on the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector, sending it 2 per cent lower.By the close, the S&P 500 had declined 1 per cent to 2,064.5, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2 per cent to 17,711.1 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 1 per cent to 4,760.7.Walt Disney shares fell more than 4 per cent to $102.29 after the media group missed earnings estimates for the first time in five years.Earnings a share climbed to $1.30 from $1.23 in the fiscal second quarter but missed analysts’ forecasts for $1.36 a share. Revenues rose 4 per cent to $13bn.The blue-chip company also said ESPN subscriber numbers had fallen in the quarter and that advertising revenues had decreased. The sell-off in Disney shares dragged on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average.Meanwhile, Electronic Arts bucked the wider stock market sell-off with shares rising 13.7 per cent to $73.38 after the video game maker reported fiscal fourth-quarter profits that eclipsed analysts’ estimates driven by the popularity of its Star Wars and sports titles.Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 50 cents a share exceeded estimates for 42 cents.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
16;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2016-04-29T15:19:15Z;Console games makers defy predictions of doom;Analysts forecast a ‘golden era’ for console makers and the publishers who develop games for them;When Microsoft launched the Xbox 360 gaming console in 2005, Nokia controlled almost a third of the mobile phone market and the latest innovation was a device with a front-facing camera.By the time the next Xbox arrived eight years later, Apple had released seven generations of the iPhone and five iPads, and Nokia had just sold Microsoft its struggling mobile business.In the fast-changing technology world, many assumed that consoles like the Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation— and the companies that develop games for them — would soon face game over.But as the industry goes into its earning season next week, some within the sector and the analysts who cover it are bullish about its future. The head of Sony’s gaming division and some analysts have forecast a “golden era” for console makers and the publishers who develop games for them. One reason for their enthusiasm: top publishers have seen their shares more than double in the past three years, and gain more than $20bn in market value since the start of 2015.Shares in the big four western publishers — Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft and Take-Two — have all increased by between 18 and 70 per cent since the start of 2015. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the wider S&P 500 both declined in the same period.In Japan, shares in the four companies that focus on console games — Square Enix, Capcom, Konami and Koei-Tecmo — increased by between 13 and 55 per cent, while the Nikkei 225 declined by 4.5 per cent in the same period. Nintendo develops games for its own consoles and its Wii U has struggled compared to the PS4 and Xbox One, but despite difficulties even its shares have increased 20 per cent since the start of 2015.The major games publishers are following the approach of the big six Hollywood studios by focusing on a small numbers of big-budget blockbusters, and exploiting them to build a similar scale of market dominance. They even share the common criticism that they have become too reliant on sequels. According to NPD Group, the market research company, 10 companies account for almost 90 per cent of physical game sales in the US, with the big four western publishers accounting for more than half of the total.Doug Creutz, senior analyst at Cowen and Company, says “people who thought these companies were going to get replaced were probably people who never played video games”.“People focus on hardware way too much — it’s a content business, not a technology business,” he continues. “You can’t put Grand Theft Auto V on an iPhone, it’s not the same experience. People were thinking about them like software companies when they should look at them like television and movies.”The positivity contrasts with years of warnings and fear that the industry had entered permanent decline set against rapid growth in the mobile games market. The number of publishers capable of developing so-called “triple-A” games — those with the highest production values and budgets — has fallen from a peak of about 80 to between 10 and 15, according to Yoshio Osaki, president of IDG Consulting, a specialist games consultancy.Experienced publishers such as THQ and Midway, creator of the Mortal Kombat series and the fourth-biggest publisher by sales in 2000, collapsed as sales declined. Other groups moved to focus on smaller mobile titles.Alain Martinez is chief financial officer of Ubisoft, a Paris-based gaming group that is being courted by media group Vivendi, which increased its stake in the company to more than 17 per cent and asked for a board seat on Friday.Mr Martinez said the long gap between new consoles led output to grow “a little stale”. He admits that “people had serious doubts about the future of high-end games”.Since the release of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2013, however, sales have rebounded, with combined PS4 and Xbox sales almost 50 per cent higher than the previous console cycle. This week Sony announced that the PS4’s success had helped the company to its first full-year net profit in three years.In a presentation to analysts on Thursday, Sony said it expects the console’s strong momentum to continue, and its success has translated into higher revenues for games publishers. Global revenues from console games are forecast to reach $28bn for the first time since 2010 this year, according to PwC, the professional services firm.Consolidation means the remaining companies are enjoying a bigger share of those revenues, while new technology has helped them to significantly improve margins. Selling games as direct downloads to customers’ consoles has allowed publishers to avoid paying a slice of revenue to retailers, and many have established entirely new divisions to track customers and generate extra money from old games.Industry figures described their old business model as “fire and forget”: a game would be released, a customer would buy a cartridge or disc, and publishers would move on to developing the next one. Now, Mr Martinez says, “we have a precise knowledge of what and how and with whom customers play, we have a much better context for communicating with them”. As well as fixing problems after release, publishers increasingly sell additional content such as new levels, playable characters or game modes that are much cheaper to produce than a whole new game.“We’ve gone from being like a Ford Model T, where every car has the same colour, to being more like a Jaguar or Mercedes, who can offer extra options and make more on those than on the base car,” says Mr Martinez.Publishers adapted such micropayment methods from the mobile and social games that some had thought would threaten their business model. They also expanded directly into new markets with their own mobile games. Activision Blizzard, the largest gaming company in the US, paid $5.9bn for Candy Crush developer King Digital, while shares in Nintendo surged last month after the unexpected success of its first mobile app.However, the discount price paid for King — Activision’s $18 per share takeover was 20 per cent lower than the price at King’s 2014 initial public offering — also highlights one of the factors that have drawn investors back to consoles.In contrast to the unpredictable mobile market, the reliable revenues of “triple-A” franchises such as Call of Duty and Assassin’s Creed, and the high barriers to entry for any would-be competitors, have made big developers more appealing to investors.Mobile games are much cheaper to produce, making it easier for new competitors to emerge, and mainly target “casual” gamers, who are less likely to be loyal to a particular series.Neil Doshi, an analyst at Mizuho, says “it’s very hard to build a business around casual gamers. A lot of investors got burnt on companies like Zynga because as soon as interest waned revenue and margins collapsed. People felt these businesses may not be sustainable as investment idea.”Mr Doshi adds, however, that the console market “is starting to feel saturated”, and Activision, EA and Ubisoft have all disappointed investors with recent sales figures or targets. The PS4 and Xbox One’s success has relied on hardcore, committed gamers, and Mr Osaki believes console makers and games developers will soon have to provide more mass market offerings to achieve further growth.Ubisoft’s Mr Martinez says there is still capacity for growth and said new markets such as Latin America and eastern Europe are growing even if sales in mature markets such as the US remain fairly flat.If the remaining triple-A developers benefit from operating like Hollywood film studios, however, they also face the same challenges. In 2015, 54 per cent of EA’s revenues came from just three franchises, while Take-Two is even more reliant on its Grand Theft Auto series. Production delays or a few flops could cause serious damage.“It’s a creative business, and I don’t know any publisher that hasn’t postponed a game at one point,” Mr Martinez adds. “The fans are very experienced and demanding, so we need to ensure we deliver.”At its peak in 2012, social games company Zynga was valued at more than seven times higher than fellow US games company Take-Two. Today, the roles have switched: Take-Two’s market capitalisation is about 40 per cent higher than the FarmVille creator.The focus on FarmVille highlights Zynga’s big difficulty: its most well-known game is seven years old, and the company has struggled to replicate a similar level of success. Zynga’s shares have fallen 83 per cent from their post-IPO peak in 2012, and it has not posted a full-year profit since 2010.Casual gaming has not gone away in that time — it is forecast to be worth more than $22bn in annual revenues by 2019, according to PwC. The problem is that few companies have been able to achieve repeat success, making investors increasingly wary.Yoshio Osaki, president of IDG Consulting, says “just because mobile is growing faster doesn’t mean it’s easier to be successful”.The most popular mobile games rely on a “freemium” model, through which only a small percentage of users pay to speed up play or boost their abilities. So publishers need to reach huge numbers of users to make profits.Helsinki-based Supercell has succeeded by focusing on a small number of titles — Clash Royale, released earlier this year, was only its fourth game — but the sheer volume of mobile games makes it difficult for many to capture gamers’ attention.Five hundred new games enter app stores every day, and analysts at Goldman Sachs suggest console developers’ recognisable brands will help their expansions into mobile stand out, offering a chance for further growth rather than threatening their revenues.“There used to be maybe 80 developers that could make a big triple-A console title, now there are 10 to 15,” says Mr Osaki. “On mobile you’re competing with tens of thousands.”
17;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Supercell growth slows but still leaves rivals in its wake;Clash of Clans group makes $6m a day with three games;Growth at Supercell slowed last year but the performance of the Finnish mobile gaming group still left most rivals in the shade as its three titles made nearly $6m per day.Sales at the maker of Clash of Clans, Hay Day and Boom Beach rose by 36 per cent to €2.11bn after tripling in 2014.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation increased by 65 per cent to €848m in 2015, compared with a doubling the previous year.Supercell has defied the teething problems suffered by many mobile gaming companies that have struggled to replicate their early successes such as Rovio with Angry Birds and King Digital with Candy Crush Saga.The group has focused on a small number of titles, only earlier this year releasing its fourth — Clash Royale, a card game based on the still immensely popular Clash of Clans.It has killed off more than a dozen titles, celebrating each failure with champagne. By contrast, companies such as Electronic Arts and King have hundreds of mobile games.Supercell has also become one of the most profitable companies in the world per employee as the Helsinki-based company has only 180 workers. It remains unlisted with SoftBank, the Japanese technology company, owning about three-quarters of the business.“These financial results are of course great and we are very proud of them. However, the real highlight for us is how we’ve been able to get here while staying true to our founding vision that was all about people,” said Ilkka Paananen, Supercell’s chief executive.The company has become perhaps the most successful of the start-ups focusing on so-called freemium games, whereby most players pay nothing but a small group — known by some in the industry as “whales” — pay thousands of dollars or euros to speed up play or boost their powers.Mr Paananen has been forced to defend Supercell and the wider industry from accusations that its business model led some players to become addicted after reports of people taking iPads into the shower with them and spending large sums to stay on top of leader boards.Supercell has consistently added new features to its existing games, helping keep Clash of Clans in particular as perhaps the most popular mobile game. It has also been one of the few gaming companies to combine success in Asia with dominance in Europe and the US. The group announced earlier this week that it now had 100m daily players.

Both Electronic Arts and Ryder are rated among the lowest levels of investment grade, which contrasts with the A minus or higher rating that the sales earned on Monday.“We have seen over and over again the fact that we have had these windows of opportunity in between bouts of volatility,” said Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott. Tuesday was a “test of the waters. Prior issues by these companies were oversubscribed. If they come with new issues and they are oversubscribed, lower-rated companies should have success.”Hans Mikkelsen, a credit strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, noted that the offerings on Tuesday came at a price: companies had to pay up.The yield on bonds issued by the group were on average 19 basis points more than on similar dated paper issued by the five companies in years past.While spreads have widened significantly in the investment grade market — the difference between the average issue in the BofA Merrill Lynch US corporate bond index and its respective benchmark Treasury has widened to 219bp from 129bp last March — Mr Mikkelsen put most of the move down to the rally in Treasury prices.“High-grade investors tend to be yield sensitive, and hence when interest rates decline rapidly they tend to sit on the sidelines,” he said. “That ‘buyer strike’ type behaviour leads to ‘sticky’ corporate yields, and thus the big decline in risk-free interest rates gets reflected in significant spread widening almost in the relation one-to-one.”Portfolio managers say they are closely watching the performance of new issues after bond sales in January sold off alongside the market’s move lower. If prices rise or are stable, investors say they could expect a wave of offerings from companies that have waited for volatility to subside.The new paper from Apple and Comcast advanced following the Tuesday sale. The iPhone maker’s new 30-year bonds, which sold with a yield of 4.69 per cent, tightened to trade with a yield of 4.65 per cent, data from bond trading platform MarketAxess showed.Earlier in the day, the yield hit a low of 4.53 per cent as the bond price rallied to 101.96 cents on the dollar. Yields move inversely to prices.The offerings have lifted US marketed high-grade bond deals to $156bn, 3.3 per cent below the year-ago amount of $161bn, Dealogic figures show. However, the issuance has been concentrated among fewer issuers. The average deal this year has eclipsed $1.8bn, more than double the average through the same point in 2015.Fewer than 90 investment grade companies have sold debt to US investors this year, the lowest number since at least 1995.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt"

In the junk market, Prestige Brands raised $350m, US capital markets correspondent Eric Platt reports.It had been 12 days since an A minus or higher rated company had completed a bond deal — a drought that had somewhat concerned investors —, according to Dealogic.On Wednesday, US gaming group Electronic Arts, trucking company Ryder Systems and Kimberly-Clark, the maker of personal and healthcare goods, added their names to the list.Hans Mikkelsen, a credit strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, noted that the offerings on Tuesday came at a price: companies had to pay up.

20;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Strong dollar takes bite out of Colgate;Broader US markets close poor month on brighter note;The strong dollar has taken the bite out of Colgate’s sales, pushing the toothpaste maker into its first quarterly loss in at least 10 years.The New-York based company saw net sales slip 7.5 per cent to $3.9bn during the fourth quarter of 2015. Better sales volume and higher pricing had helped Colgate-Palmolive deliver a 5 per cent jump in organic sales during the period.Currency headwinds however, knocked 11.5 percentage points off sales, wiping out these gains. That, along with a $1.1bn writedown on its business in Venezuela, pushed Colgate into a $458m loss, compared with a profit of $628m in the same quarter in 2014.Colgate generates two-thirds of its revenues from outside North America, and the dollar’s appreciation against a number of major developed and emerging market currencies has sharply eroded the value of its sales in those countries.“Macroeconomic conditions and foreign exchange volatility remain challenging,” said Ian Cook, chief executive. Based on current exchange rates Colgate expects a “low single-digit earnings per share decline” this year, he added.Shares in Colgate, which are up 0.6 per cent over the past 12 months, gained 3.9 per cent by the close of trading.Elsewhere, the latest instalment of Star Wars wasn’t enough to save Electronic Arts, one of the world’s biggest video game makers, from disappointing Wall Street on Friday. Although the company, which is headquartered in Redwood City, California, said that sales for its Star Wars game beat its own forecasts, the shares slid after its outlook for the current quarter fell short of estimates.Electronic Arts predicted earnings per share, with one-time items stripped out, of 40 cents a share, compared with the 50 cents expected by analysts, according to a survey by Bloomberg. The shares declined 7.5 per cent to $64.54.Simon Property reported weaker than expected results for the fourth quarter, mired by slowing growth in tenant sales for the biggest listed real estate company in the US.Funds from operations, the most widely used profitability metric for real estate investment trusts, fell to $867m, or $2.40 a share, compared with $897m, or $2.47 a share, for the same period a year ago. Analysts had expected $2.44 a share.Simon, the biggest American mall owner by every measure, has rejigged its portfolio in the past few years, shedding smaller, less-profitable shopping centres for big malls and outlets, and thereby boosting its occupancy rates.Tenant sales for Simon’s US malls nudged up to $620 per square foot for the quarter, from $619 per square foot a year ago, but occupancy rates slipped to 96.1 per cent, from 97.1 per cent a year ago.Simon’s shares have fallen 4.3 per cent this year, along with other real estate investment trusts which have been dented by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate rise and broader market anxiety.Shares in Amazon continued to suffer on Friday, after the world’s largest online retailer released weak results late on Thursday. Shares in Amazon fell 7.6 per cent, although the stock is still up 88 per cent over the past 12 months.US stocks ended the week on a cheerful note after a grim January, lifted by a fresh round of easing from the Bank of Japan that boosted sentiment for equities across the globe.By the close of markets in New York, the S&P 500 gained 2.5 per cent to 1,940.24, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2.5 per cent to 16,466.30 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.4 per cent to 4,613.95.
21;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2015-12-06T18:05:06Z;Sony banks on record sales of PlayStation 4 to drive turnround;Console expected to exceed PS2 on back of exclusive deals with leading gaming companies;"The popularity of the PlayStation 4 is bolstering Sony’s long-term confidence for its flagship games console, after sales topped 30m units last month.The PS4 has become the fastest-selling home console ever, exceeding the early performance of the PlayStation 2 which went on to sell more units than any other console over its 12-year life.Andrew House, president and global chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment, said this weekend that he expected the PS4 to match or outpace the PS2’s sales in its first three to five years.“We’ve just seen the most successful Black Friday in the company’s history,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. “We are now trying to benchmark against the success of the PlayStation 2 — or exceed it if possible.”The PS4’s performance has been boosted by growth in new markets such as the Middle East and China, after a 14-year ban on sales there was lifted in March.In Europe, Germany has become Sony’s largest console market for the first time, as gamers increasingly switch from PCs to Playstations.The company has been able to stay ahead of rivals such as Microsoft’s Xbox One and Nintendo’s Wii U partly through exclusive content partnerships with leading games makers. These have included a deal with Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest games publisher, for last month’s launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. Such deals have added to the PS4’s popularity with hardcore gamers.Although the portable PlayStation Vita has not fared so well, Sony’s home console has performed better than many analysts had anticipated, given the huge growth in mobile gaming in recent years.“Rumours of the demise of the console have been greatly exaggerated,” Mr House said.Mr House’s comments suggested a more aggressive target than some analysts had forecast for a business that is becoming ever more central to Sony’s wider turnround.Three years after its March 2000 launch, the PS2 had sold 51m units, and by the end of 2005 more than 100m had been sold.We’ve just seen the most successful Black Friday in the company’s historyIHS, the market researcher, predicted last month that the PS4 customer base would not exceed 100m until 2020. But if the PS4 follows the PS2’s trajectory over its first five years, that milestone could be reached by the end of 2018.Mr House was “hesitant to predict” that the PS4 would top the PS2’s lifetime sales of 155m, given “the cadence at which people expect innovation” was speeding up.He was speaking at the PlayStation Experience event in San Francisco, where Sony showed off its latest releases to 15,000 customers. Alongside demonstrations of the latest instalments of games including Street Fighter and Call of Duty, many attendees were most keen to try out the PlayStation virtual reality headset, slated for release in the first half of next year.Mr House admitted that he “started out as somewhat sceptical” of VR but was won over by The London Heist, a gangster game developed by one of Sony’s studios. “I had that amazing moment where I tried to put the controller on the table”, he said, only to realise that the table existed in the virtual world of his headset.Other early titles for PlayStation VR include: Ubisoft’s Eagle Flight, where the player soars above cities and between trees; Modern Zombie Taxi Co, a cartoonishly zany driving game; and 100ft Robot Golf, a science-fiction sports simulator.However, some leading publishers such as Electronic Arts and Activision have yet to announce significant commitments to VR gaming. IHS has predicted just 2.5m VR headsets will be sold next year, with PlayStation leading rivals such as Oculus and Vive, owned by smartphone maker HTC.“I don’t think those kinds of volumes would be either unrealistic or a disappointment,” Mr House said. “You don’t necessarily need tens of millions of units to be a solid platform for there to be a good, vibrant developer community — but it certainly helps.”Momentum in new VR content is “still more weighted towards the independent development community”, he admitted, as smaller companies were prepared to take bigger risks on a new technology where production costs may be lower than today’s multimillion-dollar console blockbusters.“We are seeing more of the majors start to get into this space,” he added. “We are at the start of a very new medium. I think this will be a long road.”"
22;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Virtual reality in search for killer gaming app;Industry still needs ‘system seller’ to help persuade mainstream consumers to buy headsets;Mark Zuckerberg has already invested billions of dollars to bring virtual reality to the masses. But the night before Oculus Connect, a crucial showcase in Hollywood this week for the company’s Oculus Rift headset, something vital was missing from the line-up: a killer gaming app with global appeal.Since the first Oculus prototypes were sent to developers two and a half years ago, hundreds of games have been created for the pioneering VR device by a passionate community of enthusiasts.But while a few are extensions of familiar franchises, such as the space-fighter game Eve: Valkyrie, most of the biggest companies in the gaming sector such as Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard are absent.And while Oculus’s prototypes were the first to popularise a new generation of VR headsets, competition is looming from Sony’s PlayStation VR and Vive, a collaboration between smartphone maker HTC and games publisher Valve, to low-cost alternatives such as Google Cardboard and Microsoft’s forthcoming Hololens.Yet the entire VR industry is still searching for a so-called “system seller”, a product that will convince mainstream consumers to strap ungainly headsets to their faces.While Google Cardboard has provided a taste of the technology to an estimated 2m users, Oculus’s Rift and its high-end competitors will offer much more sophisticated experiences thanks to more powerful graphics and motion-tracking capabilities.Oculus Connect, the company’s annual developer event, is Facebook’s last opportunity to rally app makers and games creators before the Rift is released to consumers early next year.Early last year, Oculus executives identified one hugely popular title that would work particularly well in VR: Minecraft, the expansive world-building game that has sold more than 70m copies.“Minecraft was something I was desperate to get into virtual reality because I thought it would be critically important,” John Carmack, Oculus’s chief technology officer, told 1,500 Connect attendees on Thursday. “It’s the single most important application that we can have to ensure we have an army of fanatic, passionate supporters that will advocate why VR is great. It’s part of this infinite playability that our current ecosystem is missing.”But when Facebook acquired Oculus in March 2014 for $2bn, Minecraft creator Markus Persson pulled out of talks to bring the game to the system. “Facebook creeps me out,” he said.After Mojang, Minecraft’s parent company, was acquired by Microsoft for $2.5bn in September last year, Mr Carmack was given access to the game’s software code and began to adapt the software to VR.But despite months of work and “pestering” by Mr Carmack, it took an eleventh-hour meeting between Mr Zuckerberg and Satya Nadella, Microsoft chief executive, for the deal to be completed. It was finally signed late on Wednesday night, mere hours ahead of Oculus’s big event.The Minecraft partnership was announced by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey on Thursday morning. New apps were also unveiled to allow users to watch Netflix and Hulu videos in a virtual screening room and a cheaper version of Samsung’s smartphone-based headset, Gear VR, costing $99, about half the price of the original device.Even with household names such as Minecraft and Netflix on board, Oculus’s success is far from assured.Mr Zuckerberg opened the event by telling attendees that VR was the “next great technology platform” but he also warned that initial sales of headsets would grow “slowly”.Yet that did little to dent the enthusiasm of the games developers, Silicon Valley investors and Hollywood executives who have bought into the promise of VR.“We are in a once-in-a-century opportunity with VR,” says Martin Kenwright, a gaming industry veteran behind PlayStation games such as Motorstorm.Starship, Mr Kenwright’s new digital studio, has created a VR social networking app called vTime that allows users to connect online wherever they are in the real world. Users of the app can have their avatars meet within the technology to chat on virtual speedboats, planes and art galleries which have photos from users’ phones hanging on the walls. “We are in it for the long run,” he says.This week saw one of the largest funding rounds for a VR start-up, as Walt Disney and Evolution Media Partners led a $65m investment in Jaunt, a maker of live-action “cinematic VR” technology.Rick Hess, founder of Evolution, a joint venture between talent agency CAA, investment firm TPG Growth and Hollywood producer Participant Media, says he invested after watching a Grateful Dead concert that had been filmed by the company.“The experience of being at a live event was mind-blowing,” he says. “It’s so immersive because it’s 360-degree, and you get to control what you look at.”Facebook added the ability to view such 360-degree videos to its news feed this week.Mr Hess believes that the implications for live sports, television news and cinema are far-reaching.“I think this has the same resonance and impact on film that sound did,” he says. ”It will force a reinvention of storytelling.”But even some who are convinced by VR’s potential are taking a more cautious approach until they see how consumers respond to Oculus.“We’re really intrigued by VR, but we are investigating in an experimental way rather than betting huge resources on it,” says Michael Acton Smith, founder and chairman of Mind Candy, creator of online children’s game Moshi Monsters.While Mr Acton Smith says the technology will “disrupt multiple industries”, he predicts making money from VR games will be “challenging” in the short term.Anjney Midha, a partner in the early-stage Edge fund at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, believes that the lower price Gear VR will help bring the technology to a mass audience of smartphone owners. But he cautions that too many developers are focusing on the wrong areas and likens the VR market to the early days of the iPhone’s App Store.“There was a first wave of app developers who went after the most intuitive and logical problems. Either they were too early or the [mobile] platforms ended up building many of those apps themselves,” he says. “There was a second wave of companies that ended up building more mature apps. In VR, I worry sometimes that we are in the first wave right now.”The experience of being at a live event was mind-blowing. It’s so immersive because it’s 360-degree, and you get to control what you look atDemonstrations of games at Oculus Connect ranged from Bullet Train, a first-person shooting game inspired by science-fiction movie The Matrix that allows the player to slow down time and catch bullets, to Job Simulator, which puts the player in an office cubicle in an imagined future when computers have made human employees unnecessary.Oculus also unveiled Medium, an artistic program that uses motion-sensing controllers to sculpt 3D “digital clay”.Brendan Iribe, Oculus chief executive, says the company’s approach to finding the Rift’s “killer app” is more like Apple or Microsoft, which rely on external developers to invent new uses for their platforms, than Nintendo, whose in-house games such as Super Mario and Pokemon keep fans coming back to buy its consoles.“We are focusing mostly on the platform but we make a few core services,” Mr Iribe says, including Medium and Oculus Video. “A lot of that is to inspire other developers.”While Minecraft is an important win for Oculus, Mr Iribe predicts that the hit games of the VR world will make a clear break from what has existed previously. “For the most part, the really big ‘system sellers’ are going to be made-for-VR experiences, something brand new,” he says.Ustwo, the studio behind hit mobile game Monument Valley, this week unveiled its first foray into virtual reality called Land's End.The game is a gentler experience than most of the shoot-‘em-ups and space flight simulators on show at Oculus Connect. It requires no handheld controller or complex tutorial. Instead, the player floats around a stylised landscape and unlocks puzzles simply by staring at particular spots.“This opportunity to shape a medium doesn’t come along very often,” says Peter Pashley, technical director at Ustwo.Ustwo has offices in London, New York, Malmo and Sydney. Monument Valley, an MC Escher-inspired puzzler, won several awards from Apple and Bafta for its geometric design and original gameplay.“It took a long time for the major game companies to figure out how to make iPhone games,” said Ken Wong, lead designer at Ustwo. “Here we are again with VR where the rules haven’t been set.”Mr Pashley warns of a “huge spike in the learning curve” when developing for VR. Much of the software for the Oculus devices created so far is of uneven quality, raising questions about whether consumers will want to buy them.“I don’t think they are going to sell 20m units just through the content we are seeing today,” he says.Land's End runs on the Gear VR, a $99 headset created in collaboration between Oculus and Samsung that uses Galaxy smartphones as its screen. It is much cheaper and more portable than the PC-based Oculus Rift but lacks sophisticated head-tracking.The Land's End experience was designed to avoid the nausea which can sometimes be caused by action-packed VR games. For example, most of the 3D virtual environment — from mountains and rolling oceans to strange standing stones — is seen from a distance, because putting objects too close to the viewer can cause queasiness.“Some people choose to put you in something fast-moving and dizzying,” Mr Wong says. “We want to take care of you and give you a good time.”

Analysts had forecast earnings of 26 cents a share on sales of $850m.Electronic Arts said Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Fifa 15, Madden NFL 15 and Battlefield 4 were among its best-performing games.Monthly active users for its mobile titles averaged more than 165m in the period, up from 160m in the prior quarter. The company also said that its mobile revenue hit a new record of $524m for the full fiscal year.More broadly, Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie, said US video game publishers will benefit from less competition among AAA titles — high-quality, big budget games — high average revenue per user and rising margins.“The bottom line is that we continue to like the video game group both for the improving financial metrics and for the strategic value of its content for emerging platforms and geographies,” he said.Shares in Electronic Arts, which have gained more than 100 per cent in the past year, rose 3 per cent to $60.93.Fossil was among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500, after analysts at Cowen & Co downgraded the stock to “market perform” from “outperform” and lowered their target price from $92 to $90.“Fossil has a top brand portfolio, attractive margins & strong global profile; but, we fear watch industry growth may further contract, expect tightening inventories at retail, and note mixed performance across brands,” said Oliver Chen, an analyst at Cowen & Co.He also added that their surveys suggest the Apple Watch has so far been a negative for Fossil.The US watchmaker reported first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates but sales that missed forecasts.The Texas-based company maintained its full-year guidance on a constant currency basis but warned that it expects results “will be significantly negatively impacted by foreign currency changes as well as restructuring charges”.Fossil shares declined 7 per cent to $80.63.Shares in Chesapeake Energy fell 7 per cent to $14.72 after the oil and gas producer reported a first-quarter loss driven by an impairment charge.The Oklahoma City-based company reported a loss of $3.8bn, or $5.72 per diluted share, compared with profits of $374m or 54 cents a share in the year ago period.On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings of 11 cents a share. Sales fell 45 per cent to $2.8bn.Analysts at Jefferies downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “hold” and lowered their price target to $12 from $13.US stocks declined for a second straight day following disappointing economic data and after Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen said stock valuations are “quite high” at a conference sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking.The S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent to 2,080.15, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.5 per cent to 17,841.98 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4 per cent to 4,919.64.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar"

Recent surveys suggest a hung parliament, forcing either the Labour or Conservative party into a coalition government. Sterling has come under pressure in the lead up to the election, and implied volatility in the pound-dollar currency pair — a measure of expected volatility in the future — has climbed.US Jobs ReportJobs growth in the world’s largest economy is thought to have bounced back after a disappointing report in March showed the slowest monthly gain in more than a year. Economists expect the closely scrutinised non-farm payrolls report will show a 225,000 increase in jobs from a month earlier, with the unemployment rate projected to fall from 5.5 to 5.4 per cent.Greek PaymentDespite a sharp drop in Greek bond yields, investors will be watching for any news on negotiations between Athens and its international creditors over the weekend. The country gathered enough money to pay obligations due to pensioners and people familiar with the matter have told the FT that Athens should be able to make a €200m interest payment to the International Monetary Fund due on May 6.EarningsEarnings season in the US roars on, with more than 80 companies in the S&P 500 reporting in the coming days. The list includes Loews Corp, Walt Disney, Mylan, Kellogg, Electronic Arts, Fossil, Chesapeake Energy, Motorola Solutions, Twenty-First Century Fox, Whole Foods Market, Priceline and Monster Beverage.The Week in Four ChartsEven Germany’s safe-haven government bond market can suffer a sell-off. That was the surprise for investors this week, after prices of both short- and long-dated German tenors slid following a lacklustre auction of new government debt. The yield on the 10-year note jumped roughly 20 basis points to trade at 0.37 per cent — earlier in the month the yield had fallen as low as 0.07 per cent.Greek bond yields tumbled over the course of the week after Athens reshuffled its team negotiating with international creditors on a list of economic reforms to unlock bailout funding. While a deal remains elusive, the yield on Greece’s 10-year note declined to 10.23 per cent, roughly 300 basis points below a high reached earlier this month.Apple once again eclipsed consensus expectations for revenues, earnings and iPhone sales with its results for the second quarter, as it increased its shareholder return programme to $200bn, briefly sending its stock to a record.Results from the wider tech sector did not prove as lively. Twitter shares tumbled more than 25 per cent over a two-day period after the messaging company missed revenue expectations, prompting downgrades from Barclays and Janney Montgomery Scott. Yelp and LinkedIn also suffered stock price drops following quarterly results.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
25;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2015-03-02T06:52:29Z;Developers see the future of games on smaller mobile screens;Consoles are being supplanted by mobile devices;When King Digital Entertainment launched its eagerly awaited follow-up to the popular mobile game Candy Crush Saga, it looked far beyond Apple’s App Store to promote it.Videos heralding the arrival of the Candy Crush Soda Saga blitzed 100m Facebook newsfeeds in a single day. TV spots aired in 20 countries and digital billboards were flooded with fizzy bubbles around the globe.The multimillion-dollar launch illustrates that mobile gaming is no longer a poor relation of video games. Newzoo, a research company, forecasts that the mobile games industry, which it says has predicted global revenues of $30.3bn in 2015, is poised to overtake console games sales for the first time.Underlining the transition, Newzoo said in a report that Apple’s forecast $4bn in gaming revenues — made from just hosting and selling other developers’ games, for which it takes a 30 per cent cut — is likely to be almost double Nintendo’s sales this year.As mobile games have increased in sophistication, growing numbers of players spend many hours — and dollars — on addictive titles such as Clash of Clans, Minecraft and Game of War: Fire Age.“The first wave of mobile games was simplistic — the gameplay was there but the polish wasn’t,” says Julian Farrior, chief executive of Backflip Studios, the mobile gaming company behind DragonVale and Seabeard, which is now majority owned by toymaker Hasbro.But, Mr Farrior adds: “Over time, the polish has increased, the budget has increased and revenue expectations have increased.”In the App Store’s early days, barriers to entry were low. But, as it has become harder to be noticed in an overcrowded market, promoting and distributing a hit game has become an expensive but important part of the marketing mix.“It’s a very competitive market,” says Riccardo Zacconi, King Digital’s chief executive. “The ‘top grossing’ charts are very stable. It’s a handful of developers there and the conditions for succeeding are very hard.”Despite this, King’s marketing drove Soda Saga to the top of Apple and Google’s app download charts globally for November. In its earnings report, King said it set a new quarterly record of 1.5bn average daily game plays in the three months to December.But King has an advantage other games makers do not. As well as the external advertising, many people downloading Soda Saga did so because they saw an ad in the original Candy Crush game, which has been downloaded hundreds of millions of times.Electronic Arts, a veteran console games maker, has franchises that are just as well known as King’s, including John Madden NFL football and Fifa Soccer. Even so, EA is only just starting to find its feet in mobile.Andrew Wilson, EA’s chief executive, says the company had a “breakout performance” in mobile over Christmas, generating a “record” $121m in sales, up 25 per cent over the prior year.Its rival, Activision Blizzard, whose Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises have dominated console and PC gaming, has been even slower to mobile.In late 2013, Bobby Kotick, Activision’s chief executive, said there was nothing that had driven any sizeable amount of operating profit in mobile gaming. But in its recent earnings call, Activision’s chiefs admitted mobile and tablet gaming had “moved up on our priority list” after finding success with a Warcraft spin-off, Hearthstone.Activision’s chiefs now say mobile gaming has ‘moved up’ their priority listIn the console world, developers create games and leave it to publishers, such as EA and Activision, to work with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo on distribution. Mobile games are usually free, with revenue generated from ads or in-app sales.“When you’re thinking about that transition, it isn’t wholly intuitive to console developers who are reliant on publishers for distribution,” says Mr Farrior. “In mobile, you own the distribution and the development of the piece. That’s . . . outside the comfort zone for traditional publishers.”Another challenge for console developers is that mobile games are created and updated very differently. Console games are typically left unchanged, but mobile games, once on a device, can be updated almost constantly.King, for example, adjusts the difficulty of Soda Saga’s levels every few weeks. The first “cohort” of players was looking for something more difficult than the original Candy Crush, Mr Zacconi says, while newer players want something easier.Despite the different dynamics, Mr Farrior says mobile studios such as Backflip are hiring console games developers in much greater numbers. “We’ve had to hire truly talented experience, and the bulk of that experience was in shifting from console to mobile.”Backflip is planning to use Hasbro’s brands and characters to help its games stand out. But even names that could include My Little Pony and Transformers are not enough to guarantee a hit in the mobile gaming world, Mr Farrior says.“A brand is important, but a brand alone won’t get you there,” he says.To succeed, he says, you need an “absolutely killer game”, with high retention and conversion from free downloads to paying customers. “You need to marry the good math with the good brand and have a really talented, aggressive user acquisition team.”

Adjusted earnings of $1.22 a share also topped consensus forecasts.Digital revenue, or sales from downloaded content as opposed to physical products, climbed 34 per cent and accounted for 49 per cent of total revenue in the quarter. “Over the past 12 months, digital revenues accounted for 50 per cent of total revenues, the first time this milestone has been reached for a 12-month period,” Sean McGowan, an analyst at Needham, said.Monthly active users for its mobile titles averaged more than 160m in the period, up from 155m in its fiscal second quarter. SimCity BuildIt, designed for mobile, which launched in December, has reached 22m downloads to date, ranking among the top five iOS game downloads in more than 100 countries.Time is money. And if you are spending your time staring at a mobile phone, then that is where the money is. Advertisers know that — eMarketer expects ad spending on mobiles to grow 92 per cent this year.

Adjusted earnings of 18 cents a share missed estimates for 20 cents a share. Meanwhile, sales fell 19 per cent to $2.53bn.Amid a near 60 per cent decline in crude prices since mid-June, the New York-based company’s chief executive, John Hess, said: “We are taking prudent steps in 2015 to reduce our spending and maintain our financial flexibility.” Shares of the US oil and gas explorer fell 8 per cent to $66.02.Shares of Denbury Resources fell more than 9 per cent to $6.47, as the company kept its current dividend rate unchanged for the first quarter of 2015, instead of increasing it to the previously planned $0.40 per share annualised rate.Boeing shares gained 6 per cent to $139.64, after the aircraft manufacturer topped fourth-quarter earnings estimates.US markets were weaker after the US Federal Reserve reiterated its pledge to be “patient” before raising interest rates.The S&P 500 fell 1.4 per cent to 2,002.16, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained lost 1.1 per cent to 17,191.37.

It expects non-GAAP earnings of $2.05 a share, up from $1.85 a share.The delay in the release of Battlefield 5 did “overshadow” the earnings beat in after-market trading, as it creates “a hole in the company’s line-up”, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush.He expects the company will fill its holiday schedule with Star Wars Battlefront.“At issue is the company’s ability to emulate competitor Activision’s success with annual instalments of its Call of Duty franchise, alternated among three studios each on a three-year cycle,” Mr Pachter said.Shares of Electronic Arts, however, climbed 4 per cent to $38.91 on the beat and have risen 70 per cent this year.Shares of Gilead Sciences slipped 2 per cent to $110.72 after the biopharmaceutical company missed third-quarter earnings and reported slowing sales of its hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi.The company reported net income of $2.73bn, or $1.67 a share, in the three months ended in September on sales of $6.04bn.Analysts on Wall Street were looking for earnings of $1.75 a share on sales of $6.04bn.Sovaldi sales slowed 20 per cent from the previous quarter to $2.8bn. Analysts said sales lost traction ahead of the next generation hepatitis C drug, Harvoni.Terence Flynn, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, projects hepatitis C sales of $12.5bn and $15.5bn in 2014 and 2015, respectively.He added: “Beyond 2015, we have sales declining due to increasing competition, patient mix shift and a shrinking patient pool.”Hershey shares fell 2 per cent to $94.03 after the confectioner lowered its full-year earnings and sales guidance on the back of lacklustre international demand and commodity volatility.Hershey expects sales to rise 4.75 per cent this year, below earlier forecasts for between 5 per cent and 7 per cent growth.It now expects adjusted earnings per share at 8 per cent, from 9 to 11 per cent previously.Facebook shares fell 6 per cent to $75.86 after the social media company said “significant investment” would weigh on margins next year.Shares of Shell Midstream Partners, a master limited partnership spun off from Royal Dutch Shell, climbed 42 per cent to $32.76 in its New York debut.This bucked the trend of lacklustre first day gains over the past month, which have slowed the IPO market.Stocks turned mildly negative ahead of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision.The benchmark S&P 500 slipped 0.1 per cent to 1,982.30, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 16,974.37.

28;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2014-09-23T15:40:18Z;Mobile gaming: missing the jackpot;Why are gaming companies missing out on ad revenues?;Time is money. And if you are spending your time staring at a mobile phone, then that is where the money is. Advertisers know that – eMarketer expects ad spending on mobiles to grow 92 per cent this year. But the mobile gaming world is struggling to win its fair share of those ad dollars.Android users spend a third of their device time playing games, says Flurry, an analytics company owned by Yahoo. By comparison, Facebook gets 17 per cent of phone time. But advertising in mobile games – about $6bn a year – is less than Facebook’s mobile ad revenue. The business model is different – for now: mobile games make their money from in-app purchases, to the tune of $18bn this year, with sales growing 20 per cent annually.But the growth in mobile ad spending is a lost opportunity for the gaming industry. One reason is that no one has quite figured out how to do mobile game ads well. Banner ads are tacky. And ads that are successful demand a lot of development work – such as the virtual Lexus in Real Racing 3 (by Electronic Arts). Some companies, such as Tencent, eschew ads altogether. But as it is, mobile games are less lucrative than their console counterparts. Average revenue per user in mobile games is only one-tenth of the Arpu for console games, according to Interpret.True, some gaming groups do mobile better than others. At Electronic Arts, mobile accounts for a fifth of revenues after 30 per cent growth last year. At Activision Blizzard, by contrast, mobile provides just 6 per cent of sales (excluding distribution), and mobile revenues have fallen by half from the same period last year.But there is a long way to go for the industry as a whole. The prize will be valuable for whoever cracks the code first: Android users spend 37 minutes a day playing mobile games on average, says Flurry. That figure rises to more than 45 minutes daily in the US and Germany. There’s more money here than in just buying extra lives.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex

Now as the new chief executive of the ambitious Japanese gaming company Nexon, he has seen it all.“I have developed some strong opinions on what makes a good game,” he says. “One of the advantages of having been involved in the same industry for such a long time is that it has helped me to see patterns emerge.”The softly spoken 47 year old is in the communal meeting area of Nexon’s Tokyo headquarters in the Shinkawa district, furnished in the style beloved of trendy tech companies: funky cushions, low lighting and a huge screen where employees can fight each other to the virtual death during coffee breaks.Three months into the new job, after four years as chief financial officer, Mr Mahoney’s priority was to hold “town-hall style” meetings with employees across Japan, China, South Korea and the US, largely to reassure them that he is a dedicated gamer. “A lot of people know me as the finance guy and are surprised to see me as the creator guy,” he says. “Everyone was very curious as to whether I knew anything about games or whether I just knew about numbers.”For Mr Mahoney, gaming deserves respect as an art form. He admires Japanese figures such as Shigeru Miyamoto, the Nintendo creator of enduring games such as Super Mario and the Legend of Zelda series – “the Steven Spielberg, the Pixar of our industry”. Mr Mahoney emphasised to his team that “creating great art is the only demonstrably consistent way to build a great entertainment business”. Nexon’s best-known games include MapleStory, Combat Arms and Mabinogi.Helped by a life-long obsession with Japanese history and fluency in the language, Mr Mahoney is a rare example of a foreign executive at the top of a Japanese company.But Nexon has always been un­usual. Founded 20 years ago in Seoul, its Korean founder Kim Jung-Ju uprooted the company’s headquarters to Japan in 2005 in order to compete in the same market and be in the same city as the companies he admired so much, Sega, Nintendo and Taito, which are now rivals.Nexon was a pioneer of the “freemium” gaming business model, making games free to play and then charging players for additional virtual items. Much of its success is down to the increasing ubiquity of internet access and mobile devices, which has broadened the appeal of casual gaming away from its traditional nerdy image, with players more willing to shell out for a more interesting game they can play on their tablet or smartphone. “My older sister plays casual games now but she wouldn’t be caught dead [doing so] when she was younger,” Mr Mahoney says.Annual revenues at Nexon grew 43.3 per cent last year to Y155.3bn ($1.5bn).Born:

Interests: Kiteboarding, skiing, chessNow his task is to look beyond the home market to Europe and the US so the company can extend its freemium model, its speciality being free online games that can be played on mobile devices but which are also immersive – that is, highly engrossing, in richly imagined worlds.But to make this work Nexon needs to keep the players – it had a monthly average user count of 55.9m in the first quarter of this year – keen.This will involve a twin strategy of adapting games to suit regional tastes and also scooping up games makers worldwide – Mr Mahoney’s old speciality from his days at Electronic Arts.The challenge also harks back to his difficult days at PointCast, one of the first news aggregators, in the early days of internet expansion. It was his “personal Vietnam”, says Mr Mahoney, at least partly because of the effect of slow internet speeds in the US.Joining EA after the dotcom bubble burst, his role was to help the US games company break into online gaming from its base of boxed and console games. It had spent about $400m building online features for existing packaged games and making new games for online only, but with limited success. The biggest stumbling block was the US’s relatively slow internet speed, compared with Japan and South Korea where the governments had invested heavily in providing high-speed networks.By now, Nexon was the second-biggest games company in Korea, so Mr Mahoney decided to pay it a visit. He had already met Mr Kim informally, and liked him, when he was building PointCast’s business in Asia.The trip was a revelation. Nexon was more amateur and yet more successful. Its small office in Seoul had a big space with cheap PCs from Taiwan for the server room, with a team of developers “experimenting like crazy” on free-to-play games.Their level of creativity and experimentation in their game development was unlike anything I had seen in the west“Their level of creativity and experimentation in their game development was unlike anything I had seen in the west,” Mr Mahoney says. He could not help comparing that buzz with the legions of expensive EA consultants earnestly studying how to boost its online business.Nexon’s earliest developers had stumbled on the freemium concept when a paid-for game with falling player numbers was offered for free because it was due to be withdrawn. User numbers rocketed, its lifespan was extended and the idea of charging for items such as personalising a character’s appearance took shape.He says he emailed his executive team: “I’ve seen the future and it is going to be Nexon”, in a rare moment of hyperbole. “And it was roundly ignored.”That did not stop him trying to buy Nexon for EA three times. “Come and work for us instead,” was Mr Kim’s response each time. “I finally got smart and agreed,” says Mr Mahoney.One of his first jobs was to oversee the company’s initial public offering in 2011, the biggest in Japan that year.Although its new status as a listed company means there is less time to call passing executives in for an impromptu game-testing session in his office, it has given Nexon the firepower to scoop up other Japanese games developers. When it partnered in a publishing deal with Florida’s Shiver, Nexon signalled its intention to extend beyond Asia. The group has around $1bn-$1.8bn to do deals “across the world and across sizes”.Nexon developer teams regularly visit the Seoul offices and sometimes Tokyo to learn how to incorporate idio­syncrasies of the free-to-play business model into the games they design: essentially how to identify when players may want to spend a little to have more fun, while not frustrating them or driving them away by asking for money too often.They are also schooled in adapting games to suit regional tastes: tattoos are taboo for Japanese characters, Europeans like scary warriors and in the US version of MapleStory, players can marry each other in a Vegas-style shotgun wedding and be serenaded by an Elvis impersonator.“The latter didn’t cross over to other cultures,” he remarks drily. Even a man equally at ease in both Asian and US boardrooms recognises there are sometimes cultural limits."

Its shares were 8.8 per cent higher at $21.01.The beverages sector was boosted by positive results from Molson Coors after the brewing company reported better than expected earnings, driven by improved performance across all its businesses.Its first-quarter results suggested a strategy of focusing on premium beers had paid off for the group.Profits – helped by the early ending of a Canadian joint venture – surged more than fivefold. The company’s shares climbed 3.65 per cent to $61.95.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Mondelez International shares jumped 8.2 per cent to $38.10 after it posted first-quarter earnings and said it had reached a deal with Dutch coffee and tea company D.E Master Blenders to combine their coffee businesses.By contrast, Whole Foods shares tumbled in their steepest fall for more than five years after the largest US natural grocer warned of increasing competition from popular store chains. Shares in the retailer were down 18.81 per cent to $38.93.Allergan, the US pharmaceutical company behind an anti-wrinkle treatment designed to fend off the effects of ageing, came under further pressure to accept a takeover proposal.The US maker of Botox, which last month received a bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, repeated again on Wednesday that it would “review and consider” the approach.David Pyott, Allergan chief executive, is under pressure from the company’s largest shareholder, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, to accept Valeant’s bid.Allergan has been reported to be examining whether there are other potential buyers for the company.Its latest injunction to investors came alongside its first-quarter earnings, which showed a jump in revenues from $1.45bn to $1.65bn.Profits, excluding certain items, for the quarter came in at $1.18 a share, better than the $1.13 analysts forecast.Nonetheless, shares in the group fell 0.27 per cent to $165.87.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.32 per cent to 4,067.67; the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.72 per cent to 16,518.54; and the S&P 500 added 0.56 per cent to 1,878.21."
31;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Amazon breathes new Fire into television gaming debate;;Tech companies including Apple, Google and Netflix have been redefining the idea of television for some time. But Amazon’s announcement on Wednesday of its Fire TV set-top box was not just about how Americans can increasingly rent movies or binge-watch drama series over the internet. It was also about video games.Amazon hopes that by propelling itself into the world of Minecraft and Disney Pixar’s Monsters University games – which will both be available via Fire TV – it will entice more people to stay within its so-called “ecosystem”, enjoy more content and spend more money on its growing number of services.“Amazon sees the television as a portal through which it will be able to drive commerce in time to come, so it needs unfettered access to you over this platform,” says Yousseff Squali, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.“These games are becoming more immersive – they’re hands-on. Through Fire TV people will interact with the television in a different way.The company “definitely has a longer-term vision”, he adds. “Changing people’s behaviour takes years and this was the first step in a multiyear process. Gaming is just one mechanism to achieve this.”Amazon has worked with developers including Electronic Arts and Sega to bring free and paid-for games to consumers through Fire TV, alongside movies and TV programmes.Games, including favourites such as The Walking Dead and Asphalt 8, can be played using a smartphone, a tablet or a separate Fire game controller, which can be bought for $39.99.A forthcoming update to Apple’s $99 TV box is also expected to have gaming as a focus.The moves of Amazon and others show that TV sets are not in danger of dying out. Americans spend, on average, more than five hours a day watching television, according to Nielsen.Amazon’s target customers are not the “hardcore” gamers who have helped the latest generations of Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation to sell better than expected since their launch last year.On average, paid games on Fire TV cost just $1.85. And that catalogue is supplemented by thousands of free games.With their reputation for being addictive, games such as Angry Birds and Candy Crush Saga have proved that even non-gamers can be drawn in.But the failure of Nintendo’s Wii U to replicate the success the original Wii console has left some analysts questioning the role of a device such as the Fire TV.“We expect casual gamers to continue to opt for the convenience and low pricing of games for mobile phones and tablets, at least until Fire TV is considered a viable gaming device,” says Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities.He questions the price of the device’s controller add-on, which is high relative to the games it can play.“Although Amazon has many notable partners lined up, we do not expect Fire TV’s gaming initiative to be successful, as we do not anticipate that consumers will perceive a need to play mobile games on their TVs,” Mr Pachter adds.Changing people’s behaviour takes years …Gaming is just one mechanism to achieve thisWhile it is unlikely to threaten the Xbox One or the PlayStation 4, the device could challenge Android-based “micro-consoles” such as Ouya and PlayJam’s GameStick, says Piers Harding-Rolls, analyst at IHS. The latter products were both helped to break through by the Kickstarter crowdfunding site.Fire TV is more technically powerful than those rivals. But it also has the advantage of Amazon’s large existing customer base, with credit cards already linked and ready to buy.Julie Uhrman, chief executive of Ouya, which makes Android-powered gaming consoles for TVs, says a focus on gamers gives her start-up an advantage over its larger new rival.“It’s great validation of the space,” she says. “Two years ago people questioned us – now others are following.”There is another key difference between Ouya and groups such as Amazon. “For us, games are not simply an ‘added bonus’ – they’re the whole point.”
32;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2014-03-23T15:02:06Z;Candy Crush: Play it again;The makers of the mobile game insist a secret sauce justifies their multibillion dollar valuation;On a sunny spring morning in San Francisco, thousands of gamer geeks huddle together in a dark room, all fretting over when to deploy the lollipop hammer.Hundreds of millions of players are familiar with the lollipop hammer in the mobile game Candy Crush Saga, which is capable of crushing any of the sweets in the puzzle. But few players understand quite why they find crushing a jelly bean with the lollipop hammer so satisfying – which is the secret this standing-room-only audience at the Game Developers Conference is here to learn.“At the peak of frustration, offer a way to relieve it,” counsels Nicole Lazzaro, the game designer and interaction researcher who runs XEODesign. Thus the sense of gratification from unleashing the pink hammer.Frustration, she explains, is one of the four emotions that every casual game must elicit, along with curiosity, desire and amusement. “Neuroscience teaches us that emotions help us to focus our attention and to remember.”This may seem like over-analysis of the allure of “casual” games, which few people play for more than five minutes at a time. But for the developers in attendance hoping to create the next Candy Crush, this is not frivolous stuff. The company behind Candy Crush, King Digital Entertainment, made 78 per cent of its $2bn in customer expenditure last year from the game.King will become the hero of these aspiring game makers when it lists on the New York Stock Exchange this week. Its justification for a valuation of up to $7.6bn, largely on the back of the success of just one game, rests on its claim that it has discovered the “secret sauce” to creating yet more Candy Crush-style hits.“We believe we have a repeatable and scalable game development process that is unparalleled in our industry,” King said in its prospectus to potential investors.This development process – a blend of creativity, programming prowess and perhaps a little bottled lightning – will be familiar to Hollywood producers, songwriters and novelists in the established media industries.Yet for investors in the newly hot market of mobile gaming, the question is whether creating a hit-driven yet sustainable business is truly a science. As with playing Candy Crush itself, it can sometimes be hard to tell how much of its success is skill and how much is down to pure luck.“It’s very similar to movie studios. There are movie studios that have been around for 60-plus years that still can’t manufacture blockbusters. They can still screw up,” says Thorbjörn Warin, chief marketing officer of Grand Cru, a Finnish game studio that raised $11m last year.The most frequent comparison made in debates about the King IPO is Zynga, another digital game maker that promised Wall Street it had found a data-driven formula for lucrative popularity. But its success was tied to Facebook when gamers’ attention was shifting to mobile, and suddenly Zynga’s luck ran out. Its stock price remains at little over half 2011’s IPO price and a third of its 2012 peak.King’s advocates say that it designs its games with more finesse than Zynga used with FarmVille or Mafia Wars.As its reach grew to 93m daily players, Candy Crush struck a cultural nerve, like a popular television show.But if designing the game is where creative talents let rip, keeping players engaged for months is where the science comes in. “You can’t design fun on a spreadsheet,” says Ilkka Paananen, chief executive of Supercell, the game maker valued at $3bn last year. “Once you’ve found something that is fun then you can actually make it better by just looking at the data and analysing it.”Supercell made $5.2m a day in February from just two games – Clash of Clans and Hay Day – substantially more than console publishing giant Electronic Arts makes from mobile with about 900 titles.To keep players interested, game designers constantly tweak and fine-tune their games. If too many players are turning off at a particular point, they add something new to make it more exciting. Tasks are made easier or harder, while tools can be made more or less expensive to keep players hooked.Data about the smallest nuances of players’ habits and responses is invaluable, says Petri Järvilehto, a co-founder of the Finnish-American company Seriously and one of the creators of Angry Birds. But only up to a point. “Data: you can think of it like the speedometer of your car. Knowing how fast you are going is immensely useful,” he says. “But you can’t use it to set the direction. So you have to let the creative drive the direction but validate it with data.”King argues that it has mastered such data analysis. Its highly tuned marketing machine – into which it pumped more than $300m last year – runs thousands of online advertising campaigns every day in what it says is a “highly granular and data-driven way”. It can also use its beachhead in Candy Crush to promote new titles. Not everyone agrees this is possible – Angry Birds maker Rovio has failed to launch new franchises despite its huge installed base – but there are signs that this is working for King.“They have three top 10 hits right now,” says Tero Kuittinen, a Finnish mobile analyst with Alekstra. “The problem is that their second hit might be 10 times smaller but that’s only because the first one [Candy Crush] is so abnormally enormous.”Others say that, far from producing one original idea after another, King’s other titles are too similar to Candy Crush, suggesting that the company has cracked one kind of game that players could soon tire of. “It took years and years for them to get to where they are and they have perfected that for this generation,” says Omar Hamoui, a mobile investor at Sequoia Capital, backers of WhatsApp Messenger. “But these aren’t 10-year generations, they are two-year generations.”…The business model of mobile gaming has already shifted significantly within the short life of the iPhone. Three years ago a paid-for mobile game such as Angry Birds would have been tested extensively and then released in as near to perfect state as possible.Now, all “freemium” games – which charge nothing to download and play but hope to nudge keen players to pay for extras and power-ups – are released in beta mode, allowing them to be tested in small markets such as Canada, Australia or Finland. “The launch is only the beginning and then you keep building and building,” Mr Järvilehto says. “The interesting part about it is that it’s almost like doing live focus testing with an audience of tens of thousands or almost millions sometimes.”A company such as Supercell issues updates every few weeks for Clash of Clans, a medieval combat game, and Hay Day, based on a farm. These range from the mundane – introducing a new donkey in Hay Day or wintry scenery in Clash of Clans – to the more fundamental, such as adding a social element where players can band together. It works: leaked figures show that Supercell had almost 30m daily users in February.“It’s almost like building a hobby rather than building a game,” says Mr Järvilehto. “We want to build an experience that keeps the players engaged for more than two days in a row but for very long durations.”At the heart of how these games make money are a few simple ideas or “mechanics”. One of the most powerful is time limitations. In Candy Crush, players are only given five lives and it takes 30 minutes – or a dollar or two – to get a new one.But getting the balance right is tricky. “I had to stop playing it because it infuriated me,” Mr Warin says of Candy Crush. “There were so many levels that I was close to finishing but for one, two or three moves. It’s proved that it’s good for people to fail early on in the game. People get enraged: that drives monetisation.”However, games that push players to pay too early or too often can annoy their customers, a criticism frequently levelled at Zynga. “At some point, players get mad at the game for the monetisation events,” says Ms Lazzaro. “A lot of it is driving an addiction mechanic and not necessarily providing a lot of benefit to the player.”Another ingredient of success is social networking: to encourage players to compete or at the very least co-operate with friends. In Candy Crush, getting beyond level 35 (out of 530) requires money, logging into Facebook and asking a friend for help, or waiting several days. Many choose a combination of all three.“I started by waiting, thinking I couldn’t spend money on a stupid game,” says one well-paid executive of a Swedish industrial company. “But it gnawed away at me until I gave in. I paid a little bit of money, and then some more. I even asked my Facebook friends for help.”Mobile game designers talk endlessly about the “core loop” of a game. This is the fundamental process at the heart of a game that the player will repeat over and over. In Hay Day, players first plant crops, before harvesting them, using them to feed animals or start making products, collect the products, sell them and then buy more animals or equipment.Wooga, the Berlin-based makers of Jelly Splash, another popular cartoony mobile puzzler, found that pacing the difficulty of its levels was crucial to retaining players – and making some pay.The trick, Wooga’s developers say, is to make the player believe that there is more skill involved than there really is – so it feels more like a simpler version of chess even if it is actually little more sophisticated than a slot machine.Even as some developers perfect these techniques, others argue that the rules of the game are about to change. “We at Pocket Gems believe that mobile gaming as we currently know it is going to be dead in a couple of years,” says Ben Liu, the developer’s chief executive, as games become more technically complex.The industry is watching to see how the King IPO performs. Some moan that the valuation – at about 4.2 times last year’s revenues at the top of its pricing range, far below the likes of Facebook or Twitter – is too low.But one veteran European games designer says he is deeply worried about King’s dependence on Candy Crush. “I see so many similarities with Zynga. For the industry, it would be so damaging to have another botched IPO,” he says.The mobile games sector might have worked out how to manipulate the emotions of its players but it is still looking for a formula that will win over Wall Street.——————————————-Revenue: On the hunt for whalesIt takes a surprisingly small number of gamers to make big bucks for the likes of King Digital Entertainment. Free mobile games such as Candy Crush Saga make money when a small number of players opt to pay to advance more quickly.King says that across all its games, about 4 per cent of its monthly unique users buy “power-ups”, or extra lives. Those people, on average, spend about $17 a month.But those figures do not tell the whole story. An even smaller portion of players can sometimes spend thousands of dollars, often to maintain their status at the top of a game’s rankings.While most in-app purchases are small – $5 or less – the top 10 per cent of paying users provide half of the income in a typical game, analytics service Swrve found in a study of tens of millions of users across its network of customers.As in casinos, these people are known in the mobile games business as “whales”, and they are both lucrative and a concern for many in the industry.In one of the most extreme examples, The New York Times interviewed George Yao, the former top-ranking player on Supercell’s Clash of Clans, who at one point was taking five iPads wrapped in plastic bags into the shower with him so that none of his accounts became inactive.Asked about the likes of Mr Yao, Supercell chief executive Ilkka Paananen says: “You could say that about every type of entertainment. [But] I agree with you: I don’t think you should devote your life to playing games.”A few minutes previously, however, he had described the secret of making so much money with games: “You need to create a game that people play for years, not months, and those people have to play it a lot . . . nine or 10 times a day.”Chasing whales presents its own risks for developers. Casual players might be scared off the game entirely if they see that others are spending $50 on a virtual item, while people who spend time rather than money on a game can be angered when others simply buy their way to victory.
33;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2014-03-21T19:58:46Z;Games makers dare to dream of a virtual reality future;;For the past 20 years, virtual reality has been just that: a technological dream that failed to break through into the real world. The previous time an established leader in the video-games industry tried to bring VR to life, Nintendo – riding high on the success of its Game Boy – launched the Virtual Boy in 1995. The clunky red headset was barely on the shelves for a year before the Japanese group abandoned the project, amid complaints of headaches from its monochrome screen.This week, it was Sony’s turn to dream the VR dream.At the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, industry executives and gaming fans lined up to watch the PlayStation maker unveil its “Project Morpheus” VR device, only a few yards from where a Virtual Boy was on display as part of a Nintendo museum exhibit.“VR has been a dream of many game creators ever since the computer game was created,” said Shuhei Yoshida, president of Sony PlayStation’s Worldwide Studios unit, referencing the classical god of dreams after whom Morpheus is named. He promised that wearers would be “so immersed in the world that the developer has created that you forget you are playing a game”.Sony is just the largest in a growing band of companies that are together betting tens of millions of dollars on virtual reality becoming a success. Microsoft is much rumoured to be among them, although Nintendo is yet to make a second attempt at VR.Leading the charge until now has been Oculus VR, a Californian start-up that raised $75m in venture capital funding late last year. At 21, Oculus’s founder Palmer Luckey is barely old enough to remember the Virtual Boy.“My original goal was to allow myself to experience the impossible, literally – I was building prototypes for myself,” Mr Luckey told the Financial Times. “Now I’m crazy enough to think that the world wants it.”Since the 1990s, the boom in mobile phones and other portable electronics has driven down the size, cost and weight of the sensors and screens necessary for VR.Mr Luckey began building VR headsets using spare parts from the smartphones he repaired as a teenager. As friends, then friends of friends, asked him to make more, he became convinced that others would too. Oculus now employs about 100 people and this week launched a second version of its prototype for developers, which the company claims has all the “fundamental building blocks for great VR”.“The core problem has been that the technology was never ready,” said Mr Luckey. “In the past, people who hadn’t tried VR were more excited about it than the people who had. That’s now reversed. That’s a sign that the technology is finally good enough for people to care.”Sony’s research and development team has slowly come to the same conclusion. Since 2010, it has been quietly experimenting with VR prototypes, most of which involved strapping the PlayStation 3’s motion-sensing controller Move to its guinea pigs’ heads.Neither Oculus nor Sony is planning to release a product for consumers this year. Before they do, both must overcome persistent technical hurdles such as blurry images and feelings of nausea – and considerable scepticism at the highest levels of the games industry.Don Mattrick, the former Microsoft Xbox and Electronic Arts executive who is now chief of social games company Zynga, was lukewarm on the business case when asked about VR in an onstage interview on the sidelines of GDC.“There will be a lot of concept pieces,” he said. “The forward-leaning tech stuff is really cool, but it’s hard to break through 10m [sales] of anything. If you really want to think about sustainable economics, for most developers they need to get to those numbers.”It will be even tougher to convince consumers to buy VR devices without great games to play on them from the outset.Nonetheless, many developers are clamouring to get their hands on the technology. Oculus has sold more than 60,000 of its $300 Rift prototype over the past year. Many of those who queued up to try Project Morpheus at GDC this week came away impressed by demonstrations that included being lowered into the ocean in a shark cage.“When the shark came up to me, I jumped back,” said David Klingler, an independent game developer from North Carolina who tested Sony’s device, which connects to its PlayStation 4. “I’m not going to do that on a screen. Things like that are unique to VR.”Among the first to commit to both Oculus and Morpheus is CCP Games, the Icelandic maker of multiplayer space-epic Eve Online. Several of CCP’s founders were involved in defunct 1990s VR start-ups such as OZ Interactive, and they believe the open-ended “sandbox” world of Eve’s spaceships is ideal material for virtual reality.After an Oculus-based side-project by some developers got rave reviews from fans, last year CCP assigned about 20 staff in Newcastle upon Tyne to work on a game called Eve: Valkyrie full time. In the game, the player pilots a nimble space fighter from its cockpit, shooting down enemies Top Gun-style.Creating the title for VR devices is little different in cost to developing for the latest consoles, said David Reid, CCP’s chief marketing officer, but without the well-established guidelines and pre-packaged technical shortcuts.“That makes it very exciting and very challenging,” said Mr Reid. “It is a tremendous amount of pressure to make an awesome game for them both . . . There is frankly a higher level of intensity on something like this because we are one of the prime movers in this space.”But CCP, and other early developers such as Epic Games, believe it is worth the risk.“The entrance of Sony into the market validates the vision of Oculus that VR is not going to be a novelty hobby,” Mr Reid said.“With this generation of consoles, we have a really good chance that VR to be one of the primary revenue drivers and market movers. But there’s a long way to get there.”Varying visions of virtual worldsVirtual reality was without question the dominant theme of this week’s GDC. But several different companies have varying visions of how the technology will develop.Oculus and Sony both ask gamers to don headsets and earphones that block out the real world, offering complete immersion in the virtual. Showing a pair of images on a high-definition OLED screen brings a 3D effect to the virtual worlds within and 360-degree views mean that players can look over their shoulder, above their head or even down at the legs and feet of their digital doppelgänger.Both devices use a combination of gyroscopes, infrared LEDs placed around the headset and an external camera pointing at the player to determine where they are looking. Getting that accurate, up to the millisecond, is crucial in preventing the nausea that has plagued VR devices.The objective is to create a sensation VR fans call “presence”, when the brain is tricked into thinking that what it is experiencing is real – right down to feeling vertigo on a digital cliff edge or claustrophobia in a virtual cupboard.“It’s really that feeling of being somewhere else,” says Richard Marks of Sony’s VR R&D team. “There’s no way to explain it . . . It’s really very compelling but you have to experience it to understand what it means.”Nate Mitchell, Oculus’ vice-president of product, adds: “The only other medium that delivers presence is real life.”Others technologists at GDC were demonstrating a less immersive but more sociable “augmented reality”.Technical Illusions raised $1m on crowdfunding site Kickstarter last November for castAR, a pair of geeked-out spectacles that project a hologram-like image on to special reflective surfaces. The system was an accidental discovery when former toy designer Jeri Ellsworth was working on VR at Valve, the games developer and publisher.“Not having a screen in front of your eye, you are grounded in the world,” she says, making it easier to converse with people nearby while you play. “The eye strain goes away and motion sickness is not a problem.”Meanwhile, Swedish computer-vision company 13th Lab was showcasing Rescape, in which a smartphone strapped to a toy gun turns the real world into a game of virtual paintball. Its iPhone app scans the room then recreates a digital version that superimposes enemies and fantastical environments over the real-life furniture, bringing Call of Duty out of the screen and into the living room.
34;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

The company said earnings benefited from improved credit quality and lower write-offs.“Credit quality indicators are at historically strong levels and, while many consumers are still cautious about taking on additional debt, we again saw a modest increase in card member loans this quarter,” chief executive Kenneth Chenault said.Analysts at Susquehanna Financial and Buckingham Research upgraded the company’s rating to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’ following its results. Shares climbed as much as 5 per cent to $92.41 on Friday before closing up 3 per cent.Bank of New York Mellon shares lost 3.6 per cent to $32.70 after the custody bank suffered an 18 per cent fall in fourth-quarter earnings. The bank lost $115m on its investment in ConvergEx, the Wall Street broker that was accused by US regulators over its subsidiary “fleecing” clients through hidden fees.BNY Mellon has shed jobs and cut costs to deal with continued low interest rates which eat into the profits that custodian banks can earn from their bread-and-butter business of safeguarding billions of dollars-worth of customer assets. The bank has also suffered from an industry-wide spike in litigation costs.Morgan Stanley investors shrugged off a 78 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profits, mainly on litigation costs, sending the investment bank’s shares almost 5 per cent higher to close at $33.40.Legal costs and weakness in the company’s fixed-income unit were a drag on Morgan Stanley’s profits, which at $192m, or 7 cents a share, missed analyst expectations. The company set aside $1.2bn in additional legal reserves for litigation related to residential mortgage-backed securities and the credit crisis.Shares in video game maker Electronic Arts led the S&P 500 higher, rising 12 per cent to $24.10, after analysts at CRT Capital initiated research coverage of the company with a ‘buy’ rating.The broker said it expected rising digital sales and a strong video game catalogue to lift the company’s results.“Video game stocks trade on game slates, and we believe that EA has one of the most highly anticipated games coming out at the end of March,” analyst Neil Doshi says. “And with 2014 being a World Cup year, we expect this to be a strong year for EA’s Fifa franchise.”General Electric shares fell at the fastest pace in nearly seven months after its profit margins missed goals set by chief executive Jeff Immelt.GE fell 3 per cent to $26.58. Fourth-quarter profits grew 5 per cent to $4.2bn on a 3 per cent rise in revenues to $40.4bn. Infrastructure orders in the period rose 8 per cent to $30.7bn.Mr Immelt has targeted a 70 basis point improvement in the company’s manufacturing unit’s profit margins. Margins increased 66 basis points from a year earlier.A profit warning from UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, sent the company’s stock as much as 4 per cent lower before recovering to close down 0.6 per cent at $99.91.UPS said it expected fourth-quarter and full-year earnings to be below previous expectations as it struggled to cope with a surge of last minute orders and a shortened holiday shopping season.The shipping giant said it hired 30,000 more temporary employees than planned in an effort to process the rise in shipments, weighing on profitability. Several retailers in the US were forced to apologise to customers after UPS and FedEx failed to deliver packages on time for Christmas as promised.Intel also weighed on the benchmark S&P 500, falling 2.6 per cent to $25.85 after reporting quarterly results short of Wall Street expectations.The Silicon Valley company said that sales at its PC division were $8.6bn, flat compared to the same quarter in 2012 but 2 per cent higher than the third. Investors have been awaiting stronger revenue growth as the company moves further away from computers. On Friday it also announced job cuts of 5 per cent of staff, affecting about 5,000 employees.The S&P 500 was marginally higher for the week, after falling 0.4 per cent to 1,838.70 on Friday. The index, which had earlier this week erased some of its losses, remains lower since the year began.The index struggled for direction on Friday, after a preliminary reading of consumer confidence in the US showed a decline. The report, by the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters, showed a divergence in economic expectations between middle- and high-income households.Economists at Barclays noted the expiration of unemployment benefits may have been responsible for the drop in sentiment.“Opinions of government economic policy soured, though, as only 9 per cent of respondents thought the government was doing a good job,” economist Cooper Howes said. “This matches the level seen during the government shutdown in October.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 16,458.56 while the Nasdaq was down 0.5 per cent at 4197.58 on Friday.
36;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2014-01-16T13:28:12Z;Guest post: Apple’s EM stumbling blocks;;"The App Store has recently celebrated a milestone, achieving $10bn in app sales since its inception. Something certainly remarkable, but how far will this success stretch beyond the western world? With the western market reaching saturation, there are swathes of potential new customers in markets including Latin America, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa who are eager for mobile content.But can Apple and other players emulate their success further afield?The ‘Trojan horse’ model that Apple employed in the west, rapidly growing the App Store whilst leaving mobile operators out of the game, will encounter one major stumbling block in emerging markets: the App Store is locked inside very expensive devices that aren’t affordable for a high proportion of consumers. For those who can look past the price point, once you’ve reached the App Store rich with thousands of applications, you need banking facilities to access the content. This is a big challenge for all application stores given the low penetration of financial services (credit and debit cards) in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. Data from the World Bank shows that the US has a penetration of 72 per cent whereas Nigeria has 19 per cent and Ghana only 11 per cent.So for people that don’t have credit or debit cards, it’s not possible to purchase apps. At the same time, it seems unlikely that Apple will bring down the cost of devices any time soon if recent launches like the 5c are anything to go by. This model was the latest in a line of devices that was tipped to be a game changer in the emerging markets but sorely disappointed on launch date because of the price. Apple has chosen its hand and it looks like it’s not out to win these potential new customers in this round. Instead it’s playing it safe in a market which it already dominates.The future success of western players in these regions is not only ordained by their payment model. An important challenge that many brands overlook is how to reach the end consumer, taking the power of the media and multiple marketing channels in the west for granted. The majority of applications that are profitable on Apple’s App Store are developed by major companies and brand heavyweights – such as Disney and EA Sports. All of these players have major marketing muscle – we’ve all seen the dominant force of EA Sports apps such as FIFA 14, which has proven to be incredibly successful. A common sequence emerges: advertising generates demand and demand generates sales.Instead of outdoor, cinema, TV, online – the traditional media channels which inform western consumers about new products and services, mobile is the only widely available and effective way to reach emerging market consumers. In many ways the Indian, sub-Saharan African, Asian and Latin American markets have evolved at a much quicker rate than in the west, leapfrogging technological devices such as laptops and televisions and adopting mobile as the prevailing multi-functional device. The International Telecommunication Union has shown that mobile SIM penetration is in fact higher in Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Brazil collectively than in the UK and US. So the real success stories will be those companies and app developers who partner with mobile operators and mobile marketing companies who have the marketing know-how to capture consumer attention in these regions.Operators are not only able to market apps via the only medium that reaches the majority of consumers, but can offer viable and preferable payment options – such as paying via their mobile plans. In our recent research, consumers in Nigeria, India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia also revealed that they view mobile operators as the most trusted third party to receive promotional messages from. 68 per cent even said they are happy to receive promotional messages over mobile on a weekly basis. Once app developers twig this situation, western app stores could be in danger of traffic decreasing. Given that Apple’s app store model currently fails to support billing options via MNOs, there is a real danger it will lose App Store traffic to other operating systems, which understand that greater flexibility and such partnerships are necessary in emerging markets.We are already seeing many partnerships between local app developers, mobile operators and mobile marketing companies who together can create content that consumers want, rather than regurgitating western material with its heavy entertainment focus. While entertainment apps are still high up the list for consumers in Saudi Arabia, Brazil, India and Nigeria, apps that are educative (preferred by 52 per cent) or offer health advice (preferred by 41 per cent), are the order of the day. In Brazil and Vietnam, one of our most popular apps is English lessons while health alerts are very successful in Nigeria.So for now, the spotlight is on the local companies who are successfully creating ecosystems of apps that are relevant to their markets, whether that’s Sharia compliant content in the Islamic world or content that passes regulations in China. If Apple and other big players want to replicate their success in the west in emerging markets, it will depend on their ability to make changes to their pricing model, payment methods and available applications. Let’s watch this space.Marco Veremis is CEO and co-founder of UpstreamRelated reading:

37;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2013-10-29T23:35:17Z;EA anticipates boost from console launches;;Electronic Arts’ Andrew Wilson set a confident tone in his first earnings report as the gaming company’s chief executive, upgrading earnings forecasts and giving a bullish outlook on console launches.“We are starting this console generation far stronger than we ever have done before,” Mr Wilson said in a conference call on Tuesday, ahead of Sony’s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox 360 going on sale next month. “EA will deliver an unprecedented line-up [of games] in the launch window.”EA said that it expects 10m of the new consoles to be sold by March 2014 and that comments from Sony and Microsoft, as well as retail orders, show “strong demand” for the biggest update to living-room gaming devices in more than seven years.Mr Wilson’s confidence comes despite a 2 per cent drop in revenues to $695m for the three months that ended September 30, as a sharp decline in sales of older PlayStation and Xbox consoles was only partly counterbalanced by strong growth in PC gaming.However, improvement to EA’s costs, which came in $50m better than it had forecast, helped narrow net losses to $273m. As a result, it increased its earnings guidance by 5 cents to $1.25 per share, but did not raise revenue expectations ahead of the new console arrivals.EA stock rose 3.4 per cent in after-hours trading, having closed 2.8 per cent lower at $24.13. Mr Wilson was appointed successor to John Riccitiello in September after previously heading EA’s sports franchises.The company’s revenues from mobile – the fastest-growing part of the games industry – were flat on last year at $75m, despite success with some app titles, such as Simpsons Tapped Out, which has generated $100m in sales since August last year. EA said that a Japanese mobile game based on the Fifa Soccer franchise for mobile gaming group Gree saw a $15m decline in earnings, as players migrated to “native” apps developed directly for the iPhone and other smartphones.Mr Wilson said that EA’s mobile brands, such as Plants Vs Zombies, “can break through the cluttered ranks” of games on smartphones and tablets. However, EA’s titles have lagged behind Supercell’s Clash of Clans and King’s Candy Crush Saga in both downloads and in-game spending by players, app-store analysts say.Setting out his priorities for the company, Mr Wilson said that it would focus on quality games that can also make a reliable profit. As the cost of developing blockbuster console games grows into tens of millions of dollars, games developers have struggled to ensure that their returns match their upfront investments.EA said that a $1.3bn off-balance-sheet charge was largely related to royalties owed from licensing brands such as Star Wars and sports rights such as Fifa and John Madden, and would be made up through sales of the games.EA this week launched the latest instalment of its flagship war game Battlefield to largely positive reviews. However, it said that demand for its most recent sports titles, such as Madden NFL and Fifa 14, had been soft.
38;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2013-10-18T14:29:34Z;Supercell finds success but questions remain over sustainability;;For a sense of how fast the video games industry is changing, look no further than Supercell, the three-year-old Finnish development studio that was this week valued at $3bn.Like its peers King and Rovio, makers of Candy Crush Saga and Angry Birds respectively, Supercell is at the forefront of a new breed of games developers that have grown at an astonishing pace by producing “freemium” games for mobiles and tablets.Titles such as Supercell’s Clash of Clans, which attracts 10m users every day on Apple’s iPhone and iPad, can be downloaded and played for free – money is made by charging for extra in-game features.These games are also attracting increasing attention from investors, thanks to the potential for huge profit margins. Supercell, which has about 100 employees, brought in $106m of operating profit and $179m of revenues in the first quarter.The question, however, is whether these profits are sustainable. So far, most of the app sensations created since the iPhone launched in 2007 have been one-hit wonders – even if, like Angry Birds, their developers have managed to sustain that hit through sequels and branding partnerships such as Star Wars.“Audiences for these types of games have proven to be extremely promiscuous,” says Ed Barton, video games expert at Strategy Analytics. “But perhaps Supercell has bottled lightning.”The games industry is haunted by the memory of what happened to Zynga, whose market capitalisation has fallen by almost three-quarters from a peak of more than $10bn after it floated in 2012 to a valuation below Supercell’s.Zynga, once the most successful game developer on Facebook, was hit hard when the social network changed the way apps were allowed to use the service. Making matters worse, Zynga has also struggled to replicate the success it found with “social gaming” on mobile devices.By contrast, King, the London-based developer that is preparing for a multibillion-dollar initial public offering in the US, has managed to make that move from social to mobile. Mobile gaming is the hottest part of the market, thanks to rapidly growing consumer adoption of smartphones and tablets. But even here, fierce competition from thousands of games developers means longevity is a challenge.“Nobody has really been able to build a sustainable games business” on mobile, says Supercell’s chief executive, Ilkka Paananen. “That happens to be our core mission. We really want to build a company that is built to last for decades.”Where Zynga and others have gone wrong is focusing on short-term returns that please investors at the end of the quarter, he says. “There’s been too much pressure on the financial side by squeezing too much out of your users and shady marketing techniques. We don’t want to have any pressures like that.”By selling a majority 51 per cent stake to SoftBank for $1.5bn, Supercell hopes to avoid that fate, leaving to King the tricky task of sweet-talking Wall Street investors. Shares in SoftBank rose more than 2 per cent in Japan on Wednesday morning, after the deal was announced, while GungHo, another games company in which it has invested, leapt 20 per cent as investors became excited about the potential of the partnership.The performance of Japan’s online games makers has varied amid concerns over sustainable profit growth. DeNA saw pre-tax profits rise by almost a third on revenue up almost 40 per cent for the year to March, while Nexon, a pioneer of the freemium business model, reported a sales increase of nearly a quarter year on year but a slight dip in net income in 2012. Gree saw net profit fall 53 per cent in the year to June.“We are extremely profitable as a company but the extreme irony is you get to this by prioritising engagement and retention” of players, not profits, Mr Paananen says. Supercell’s returns are all the more astonishing given it has just two games available – until last week – and only for iPhones and iPads. Part of the logic for going two-player with SoftBank is its expertise in Asia, where mobile devices running Google’s Android are much more popular than Apple handsets.Given the difficulty of producing new hit games, Mr Paananen says he is focused on increasing the value of the company’s existing franchises, Clash of Clans and Hay Day, for mobile devices.Mr Paananen says his goal is to create games “that people will play not for weeks, for months but actually for years”.“We believe you can’t be the number one company on any platform without being able to focus on that platform,” he says. “Very deep in our DNA is to do as few things as you can, then do it as well as you can . . . We believe that mobile will be the dominant platform of gaming for the foreseeable future.”Supercell says it wants to be like Nintendo: a games company that has for 30 years put lovable characters and fun gameplay ahead of cinematic graphics and such like.By contrast, local rival Rovio says it wants to create the “Looney Tunes of the mobile generation” with an Angry Birds movie in the pipeline. Rovio’s follow-up to Angry Birds, Amazing Alex, failed to generate enough sales to live up to its name, but the Finnish company has managed to build a big business from licensing its colourful birds and pigs to companies such as Hasbro for use on toys.Winning a power-up from SoftBank will help Supercell prevent marauding clans from disrupting its business in the same way it did to its rivals, according to one early investor.“The global nature of the deal will create a competitive advantage out of global scale,” says Kristian Segerstrale, a former Electronic Arts executive and partner at Initial Capital. Production values and rising marketing costs will push up the budgets required to create a hit game, he adds, making it harder for new entrants.However, many people in the industry warn that mobile game development is still a sector in great flux.Even the way that these games make money is being questioned. In the UK last month, a regulatory investigation into free video games found numerous cases of “unfair commercial practices” in the way that some developers charge money for virtual goods.“We’re still in a period of instability and there’s a lot of consolidation yet to come,” says Steve Bailey, games analyst at IHS. “You have so much attention and resources being poured into the assumption of success on mobile that there’s a lot of companies that have to stumble and fall.”Additional reporting by Jennifer Thompson in Tokyo
39;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2013-10-13T10:55:28Z;Lorenzo Fertitta boxing clever to export UFC;;"Weighing in at 185 pounds, aged 44, from the city of Las Vegas in Nevada is the man who bought Ultimate Fighting Championship for $2m, and turned it into an industry generating annual revenues of $500m. He is now ready to export it to Europe and Asia.Lorenzo Fertitta is the modern-day Don King, the boxing promoter who in effect owned the sport in the days of Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and Mike Tyson. Mr Fertitta rules not over boxing but over UFC, a combat sport in a caged ring, ostensibly built around martial arts.US senator John McCain once dubbed it “human cockfighting”. Mr Fertitta prefers to see it as a combination of four Olympic sports – boxing, wrestling, judo and taekwondo.Its popularity in the US, Canada and Brazil allows its top practitioners to command up to $5m a fight, or $200,000 a minute if fights go the distance, plus profit-sharing from the sport when they retire.Pay-per-view TV brings in the revenues in profit-sharing deals with Fox Sports and other broadcasters. In Canada and the US, UFC will this year generate about 6m pay-per-view transactions at $50 each.Globo in Brazil pays UFC a guaranteed fee in return for the revenues from 400,000 subscribers, who pay $40 a month, though the deal reverts to revenue-sharing in 2015. BT Sport has signed a deal for the UK.Mr Fertitta says his sports model is unique: “We produce, own and control all of our content.”The next step, he adds, is owning the distribution channel. He says UFC will be “the first digital sport”, allowing it to deal directly with the consumer. That kind of talk is enough to send traditional sports broadcasters into a cold sweat.UFC may have a way to go to realise that ambition, but it does appear to be making capital out of the vacuum created by boxing’s tarnished reputation, a sport blighted by chaotic organisation, medical concerns and a dearth of personalities.“I don’t see boxing completely going away, but it’s become less and less relevant in the US and around the world,” Mr Fertitta says.He and brother Frank knew the power of brands and the importance of customer relations when Lorenzo’s old school friend Dana White, a central figure in the early history of UFC, suggested they look at the sport in 2001.Their late father created Station Casinos, a Las Vegas gambling group which has veered wildly between flotation, leveraged buyout, bankruptcy and recovery. Station, under Frank Fertitta, is now plotting how to exploit the nascent US online gambling market.I truly believe this was the first sport on earth, before somebody kicked a ball through a net, or somebody threw a ball through a hoop or hit a ball with a stick. Somebody threw a punch, they got into a scrap and if anybody was standing around they all stood and watched. It was more UFC-style than Queensberry rules.The brothers got UFC on the cheap when the sport was on the canvas and being counted out. They legitimised it by tightening the rules – no eye-gouging, groin attacks, headbutting, small joint manipulation and sundry other fouls.They enlisted medical research to vouchsafe for its relative safety (compared with boxing) and drew audiences through a combination of free-to-air broadcasts and Ultimate Fighter, a reality TV show.It has also benefited from the rise of martial arts in the health and fitness industry. There is now a UFC Gym business with 100 outlets.“We’ve just taken a sport, organised it and branded it,” says Mr Fertitta. “That’s all we’ve done.”Expanding UFC into other regions will be launched on the back of reality TV shows for each market. The show airs in Brazil and Australia, and it will go to Canada and China. “We are looking at that as a defining moment for the company,” says Mr Fertitta.US-made sports have a poor history of exporting their products. American football is making steady but slow progress in the UK; basketball’s move into China remains a work in progress; baseball is not even trying.But Mr Fertitta says capital expenditure for expanding UFC is low. “It’s a very transportable business,” he says, and not an American sport but a global one, now broadcast in 148 countries.UFC should be able to break into some new markets relatively easily, underpinned by a UFC virtual game being developed by EA Sports. Mr Fertitta points out that martial arts originated in Asia.Other new markets, such as Europe, may require the kind of education that the US required a decade ago after Mr McCain came out with his derisory description of UFC.“We have a lot of work to do in Europe. It’s a very complex group of cultures and countries,” said Mr Fertitta.His missionary for the European market is Garry Cook, former chief executive of Manchester City, charged with organising a series of European fights in cities such as London, Stockholm and Istanbul. A schedule of fights in Asian cities has also been drawn up. The gym business is also being exported to Europe.UFC is a young sport. It is growing rapidly, but has it got staying power or will it fade away when the next big thing comes along?What gives it longevity, says Mr Fertitta, is that UFC is rooted in the origins not merely of sport but of life itself.“I truly believe this was the first sport on earth, before somebody kicked a ball through a net, or somebody threw a ball through a hoop or hit a ball with a stick,” he says.“Somebody threw a punch, they got into a scrap and if anybody was standing around they all stood and watched. It was more UFC-style than Queensberry rules.”"
40;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2013-09-20T15:21:25Z;Gaming: Buy games, not the companies;Video games are a tricky investment game to play;"Video games are about excitement; the video game industry could do with less drama. This week Nintendo’s former leader died, Electronic Arts has a new chief executive and Grand Theft Auto V has set a new sales record. Meanwhile Microsoft and Sony are optimistic about their new consoles. How to play this game?Put the console issue to one side. Perhaps Microsoft and Sony will succeed where Nintendo’s Wii U failed last year and entice gamers back to their sofas. But the two are giant corporations with bigger concerns than games. And the way games are played is changing fast. Five years ago, gamers spent about $30bn globally on console games – 60 per cent of the industry’s sales, according to PwC. Four years from now console game sales are expected to be the same, but account for 40 per cent of the market. Meanwhile online gaming sales are expected to grow at 8 per cent a year, mobile gaming at 10.This shift raises strategic questions. Nintendo’s games and characters – Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Zelda and so on – are solely available through its consoles. Many industry observers think this strategy is damaging to Nintendo’s titles’ value as well as its profits. Hiroshi Yamauchi, who died this week aged 85, had stepped away from the company which he ran for 53 years until 2002, but his influence was still strong. EA offers its titles – Fifa Soccer and Madden NFL among them – across various platforms, like other publishers. Yet both companies have struggled. Profits at Nintendo have halved in 10 years while EA’s are down by two-thirds.Nor can investors simply bet on the strongest franchises. Anyone who was sure in January that GungHo’s Puzzles & Dragons would take off in Japan is sitting on a ninefold return. But those who five years ago backed Take Two Interactive, publisher of the long-running GTA series or Activision Blizzard, whose Call of Duty sales record was just beaten, has made 5 per cent.Queues this week for GTA V were reminiscent of those for early iPhones. That is as it should be. If content – games, movies or books – is not more exciting than finance, something is wrong.That does not, alas, make it an easy investment. Few can really have been sure that plumbers rescuing a princess, or a game based on car theft would work. The best way to play?

He will head one of the world’s largest gaming companies at a critical moment for the industry, with a new generation of consoles being launched later this year and disruption from the shift to mobile and social gaming.Mr Wilson, who has been at the company for 13 years, was appointed ahead of industry veterans Peter Moore, EA’s chief operating officer and former Microsoft Xbox games head, and Frank Gibeau, president of the EA Labels development studios, who had been seen as leading candidates.Don Mattrick, a former EA and Xbox executive, had been seen as a strong external candidate before leaving Microsoft to become chief executive at Zynga in July.Mr Wilson said in a blogpost that he believed EA’s strategy of building across consoles, mobile games and free-to-play PC titles was “sound” and promised to focus on digital transformation, cross-platform content and profitable growth.“We have made strong progress in the first half of the fiscal year, establishing financial discipline and continuing to create a slate of fantastic games for current and next-generation consoles, mobile and PC. But now we’ve got to finish the job,” he said.The Australian executive, who describes himself as a surfer and triathlete, won plaudits at EA for reviving the Fifa Soccer franchise in recent years, seeing off competition from Konami’s Pro Evolution Soccer.His moves to build digital services into console games – such as Fifa Ultimate Team, which allows players to customise and manage their own football club then compete online in a fantasy league – led him to take charge of Origin, EA’s digital download service, as part of a restructuring earlier this year.“The rigorous search conducted by our board included several talented executives from both outside the company and from within EA,” said Larry Probst, EA’s executive chairman, in another blogpost. “Andrew’s appointment is a clear demonstration of the deep bench of management talent at EA.”His appointment comes as gamers around the world line up to buy the latest instalment of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, published by EA rival Take-Two Interactive, as the console industry gears up for a busy autumn. EA’s most recent blockbuster, Madden NFL, sold 1m copies in its first week upon release last month, with Fifa ’15 and Battlefield 4 set for release over the next few weeks.Microsoft and Sony will release their new Xbox and PlayStation consoles before Christmas, ushering in the first new generation of consoles in eight years, during which time Apple’s iPhone and iPad have become an increasingly popular way to play video games for many consumers.Mr Wilson will be paid an $800,000 base salary, with a target bonus of 150 per cent of that, taking his total potential annual remuneration to $2m. The bonus will be judged based on revenues, gross profits, operating expenses, earnings per share and operating income, as well as other strategic and operational targets and total shareholder return.He will also receive 1m stock options, worth $27.6m at the close of trading on Tuesday, of which 24 per cent will vest on November 1 2014 and the remainder every month for the next three years. The options will be priced after EA publishes its latest earnings next month.
42;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2013-07-02T02:12:15Z;Don Mattrick’s mobile challenge as he takes Zynga role;;Like many teenage boys, Don Mattrick was a keen video gamer growing up in Vancouver in the early 1980s. But unlike most, at the age of 17 he founded his own games company, Distinctive Software. He’s been in the games business ever since, and on Monday was appointed chief executive of Zynga, the social games company.Mr Mattrick, 49, came of age in the era of the Commodore 64, and Distinctive went on to develop games such as Test Drive, Out Run and After Burner for the PC and Amiga. By the time he was 27, Mr Mattrick had sold his company to Electronic Arts, where he went on to work for more than 15 years.The video games industry has gone through many transitions in Mr Mattrick’s career, from PC to console, from joystick to gesture-based controllers and from pixelated graphics to high-definition touchscreens. Most recently, as Microsoft’s president of interactive entertainment, he has ushered in the next generation of console gaming with the Xbox One, set to be released later this year.But despite building some of the best-known franchises in gaming at EA, including The Sims and Fifa Soccer, Mr Mattrick has little direct experience of mobile devices and “casual” social games. Zynga must master mobile gaming if it is to recover growth and end its dependence on Facebook for users and distribution, after posting an 18 per cent decline in revenues in the first quarter of 2013.“While Mr Mattrick’s relative lack of experience in mobile may be an Achilles heel, we believe his experience building networks and platforms at Microsoft should still help Zynga in pivoting away from Facebook,” says Colin Sebastian, analyst at Baird, in a note that described the executive as a “good catch”.EA was to the PlayStation era what Zynga has been to Facebook: the dominant games publisher on the platform, with a large staff and reliant on a series of big-name brands. The Sims, an open-ended PC and console game in which players manage the daily lives of a family, was a precursor to Zynga’s Farmville and its city, restaurant and fairground-themed successors.The two companies also have a personal connection in Bing Gordon, EA’s former chief creative officer who now sits on Zynga’s board. Mr Gordon, now a partner at venture investor Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, worked alongside Mr Mattrick at EA for many years.“He knows how to make hits and how to scale,” says one person familiar with Mr Mattrick’s appointment. Mark Pincus, Zynga’s founder and outgoing chief executive who will remain as chairman and product chief, had discussed for several months handing over the role to Mr Mattrick. The two are personal friends, and Mr Mattrick – who was widely seen as the leading contender to be the next chief executive of EA – had mentioned that he wanted his next role to be a CEO.He’s the best Zynga could have done – it’s a very courageous move but both for him and for Zynga it will be incredibly challengingHowever, in the industry’s main growth area of mobile devices, Zynga and EA alike have been outpaced by smaller app makers such as Supercell, maker of Clash of Clans, and King, creator of Candy Crush Saga. The platforms and marketing tactics that have created these new mobile megabrands are completely different to the era of PC and console gaming.“Zynga’s big problem remains mobile,” says Kristian Segerstrale, EA’s former executive vice-president for digital and now an investor and board member at Supercell.“The culture of creating and publishing for these devices is smaller teams, nimbler operating models and a little bit more emphasis on art and design rather than on metrics. I can’t see how Don helps fix that – he’s been at a big company running big teams for big consoles.”Mr Segerstrale says that Zynga needed “a talent magnet and an air of respectability” after a period of losing key employees and gaining a poor reputation in the industry.Mr Mattrick should help to restore trust, he says, thanks to his performance at Microsoft, which during his six-year tenure sold nearly 70m consoles and saw its Xbox Live gamer network grow from 6m members to 48m.Despite – or perhaps because of – his long tenure in the industry, Mr Mattrick may not be a familiar name to the kinds of mobile developers that Zynga needs to hire.“He’s incredibly respected,” Mr Segerstrale says. “He’s the best Zynga could have done – it’s a very courageous move but both for him and for Zynga it will be incredibly challenging.”
43;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2013-05-07T21:34:12Z;EA shares rise on pledge to keep costs down;;Electronic Arts shares rose as much as 9 per cent in extended trading as Wall Street welcomed a commitment to keep costs down in spite of the expense involved in developing games for next-generation consoles.Larry Probst, EA chairman, said the video game publisher could achieve higher revenues in the coming year while keeping operating costs essentially flat, despite the higher expenses of developing more sophisticated games.“Doing that in the middle of a hardware transition will be a challenge, something we’ve never done in the 31-year history of this company, but we are committed to making it work,” he said.EA predicted its fiscal year to March 2014 would produce $4bn in revenues and profits of $1.20 per share.“Our full year [forecast], which I think is what’s driving the stock price, is better than expected, particularly on the bottom line, because of our cost control,” Blake Jorgensen, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times.“I think analyst expectations were that we would not be able to manage costs through a console transition but that’s clearly what we’re signalling we’re focusing on.”EA shares closed at $18.41 on Tuesday but rose to $20.07 in extended trading in New York on the news. They have risen 27 per cent this year but are down 65 per cent over five years.The video game industry has suffered from the decline in software sales because of an extended console cycle, which began with the unveiling of the Xbox 360 in May 2005. Eight years on, Microsoft is expected to unveil its successor this month with the launch expected in the fourth quarter – at the same time as Sony’s successor to the PlayStation 3.EA, which has cut about 10 per cent of its workforce in recent weeks in an effort to rein in spending, is seeking a new chief executive after John Riccitiello resigned in March over the company’s disappointing performance. Mr Probst said internal and external candidates were being considered.EA’s sales for its fourth quarter ending on March 31 were $1.04bn, ahead of an analyst consensus of $1.033bn, but earnings of 55 cents per share were below Wall Street expectations of 58 cents. Management blamed $16m in severance costs resulting from recent job losses.EA recognised $121m in revenues in its fourth quarter from its Battlefield 3 Premium expansion packs for the fighting game, bringing digital revenues for the year to $1.7bn, up 36 per cent on the previous year.It predicted revenues from digital downloads of games would be up 25 per cent in the coming year, while mobile revenues would increase more than 30 per cent as the popularity of gaming on smartphones and tablets continued to grow.However, EA has been less successful with social gaming on the Facebook platform, closing a number of titles. It predicted flat revenues for the year here and said it would focus more on mobile.
44;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2013-03-28T23:15:05Z;EA gunning to blow people away this year;;John Riccitiello made a final public appearance as chief executive of Electronic Arts at the unveiling of Battlefield 4 at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco this week.He steps down on Saturday, resigning, according to the official account, over the company missing its numbers for the current fiscal year ending March 31.The poor performance of another first-person shooter, Medal of Honor: Warfighter, last autumn contributed to this, but Mr Riccitiello’s green-lighting of Battlefield 4 could give his successor an easier ride this coming year.“I think it’s going to set a new standard and blow people away, it’s going to be a top-three brand for the next 10 years,“ Frank Gibeau, EA Labels president and an obvious candidate for the CEO job, told the FT.He would not confirm analyst expectations that Battlefield, made by the DICE studio in Stockholm, will now become an annual franchise.Battlefield 3 appeared in 2011 and certainly performed much better than Medal of Honor in 2012, if not matching Mr Riccitiello’s boast at the time that it would seriously challenge Activision’s Call of Duty franchise.Analysts at Cowen and Company expect Battlefield 4 will sell 10m more units than Medal of Honor when it launches in the autumn, providing an extra $400m in revenues in the next fiscal year, with perhaps another $50m coming from PC digital downloads.The game certainly looked impressive and up to Call of Duty standards during a 17-minute demonstration of gameplay at GDC.Mr Gibeau said there were plenty of other reasons to be optimistic about the coming year – the introduction of next-generation consoles, the growth of mobile, where EA was the number-one publisher in 2012, and success in PC gaming. The latter would be achieved with titles like Command and Conquer and SimCity, which sold 1.1m units in its first two weeks, despite copies being withdrawn initially on Amazon as its online gameplay crashed.Analysts at Wedbush Securities raised their price target for EA this week from $23 to $25, citing an improving industry outlook ahead of the launch of next-generation consoles.The shares closed at $17.70 on Thursday and have risen 22 per cent so far this year, although, under six years of Mr Riccitiello’s leadership, they have lost two-thirds of their value as he struggled to turn the company around.
45;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2013-03-22T15:02:58Z;Letter from Lex – crossing the green line;As scientists reveal more information about the Big Bang, Cyprus sets the EU on a path towards implosion;Scientists revealed this week that 13.8bn years ago the universe inflated a trillion trillion trillion times in the blink of an eye during the Big Bang. Cyprus’s proposed bailout did not have quite as large an impact, but it did send loud reverberations rattling through markets. Fortunately the island’s lawmakers balked at the principle of imposing a one-off levy on bank depositors of all sizes, but the eurozone crisis is front and centre once again. Cyprus’s beleaguered banks can only look with envy at India’s HDFC and Indonesia’s Bank Central Asia, the most expensive banks in the world. Meanwhile in the US, products at the heart of the financial crisis made a return as JPMorgan planned the sale of private label mortgage bonds.In the corporate sphere, tech and consumer goods dominated. Blackstone was considering muscling in on Michael Dell’s attempt to take the company he founded private while Adobe continued its slow shift to selling software subscription services. Meanwhile, in Europe, two semiconductor-related companies experienced contrasting fortunes. The chief executive of chip designer Arm Holdings will step down this summer after quadrupling revenues and quintupling profits during his tenure. In the face of such stiff competition, Ericsson and STMicro decided to break-up their lossmaking chip joint venture. The CEO of video games maker Electronic Arts also lost out to a formidable rival in the form of Activision Blizzard as he was forced to step down after six years at the helm. The same fate should have befallen some members of the board of the world’s largest computer maker, Hewlett-Packard, but they somehow survived a shareholder protest vote. Finally, Oracle’s results showed that the corporate IT market may be in worse shape than previously believed.Elsewhere two consumer goods companies were focusing on their supply chains. Cracks started to appear in the impressive growth of high-end yoga clothing manufacturer Lululemon as it revealed that its latest workout gear is too “sheer”. The US’ largest retail pharmacy chain, Walgreens, moved towards vertically integrating its supply chain by signing a 10-year distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen. Two other retailers showed the difference between operating in Europe and Asia these days. Germany’s Metro is struggling to restructure its unwieldy portfolio of businesses while Indonesian department store Matahari was anticipating a successful refloat thanks to the country’s rapidly expanding middle class.Finally, in the oil sector, BP launched an $8bn share buyback after receiving $12.5bn in cash from Rosneft the sale of its stake in TNK-BP. The company best known for operating BP’s ill-fated Gulf of Mexico oil rig, Transocean, decided to return cash to shareholders despite its $11bn debt.John Casey, Lex Publisher
46;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;EA: off its game;Video game pioneer’s mistakes stand out when compared with rival’s success;"Electronic Arts chief executive John Riccitiello has run out of lives. After he held the controller for six years, the video game pioneer announced his departure from EA this week. His tenure saw the rise of Zynga and other mobile and social game makers. But even as these new platforms have proliferated, there remains no substitute for a hit video game whatever the platform or form of distribution.EA, during Riccitiello’s reign, spent more than $1bn buying developers of mobile and social games to keep up with the (unprofitable) leader Zynga. And in the past year, digital revenue, (including both internet download and mobile), grew nearly 40 per cent. Yet physical console games still accounted for 60 per cent of revenue, and sales from the segment fell by a quarter, pushing overall revenue down by a tenth.EA has its share of blockbusters, particularly in sports with their Madden NFL and Fifa franchises – but these require royalties to the sports leagues, so are less profitable than games developed entirely within EA. And while flops and missteps are part of any entertainment business, EA’s mistakes stand out when lined up against the hits that its rival Activision Blizzard has unleashed. Its star performers include the blockbusters World of Warcraft and Call of Duty franchises, the latter being the highest seller of 2012 according to VGChartz, a market research firm. As such, Activision Blizzard boasted revenue growth in 2012 of more than 10 per cent and its operating margin exceeds 30 per cent; EA’s operating margin is below 10 per cent.It is little surprise, then, that Activision’s stock price is up more than 60 per cent since 2009, versus a 10 per cent gain for EA. All this is great if you have been an Activision Blizzard shareholder but today’s hit maker can quickly become tomorrow’s has-been. Just ask EA.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
47;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2013-03-18T21:33:52Z;Electronic Arts to replace chief executive;;Electronic Arts, the second-largest video game publisher by market capitalisation, is replacing its chief executive as it warned fourth-quarter revenues and earnings could fall below expectations.John Riccitiello, who took over from Larry Probst as chief six years ago, will step down from the board and his post on March 30. Mr Probst, executive chairman, will reassume leadership while the board searches for a permanent replacement.EA shares have lost 65 per cent of their value since Mr Riccitiello took over in February 2007, and the company lost its crown as the leading video game publisher when Activision merged with the games division of Vivendi.However, the shares are up nearly 30 per cent this year, and analysts expressed surprise at the timing of Mr Riccitiello’s departure.Michael Pachter, video games analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Mr Riccitiello had done a poor job in his first three years, with the company overpaying for acquisitions. However, he had turned EA round in the past three years, with earnings growing.“It’s unfortunate because I think he had got everything going in the right direction, but I think the board just got tired of the languishing share price,” said Mr Pachter.Mr Probst said there had been mutual agreement that the time was right for a leadership change.“John has worked hard to lead the company through challenging transitions in our industry and was instrumental in driving our very significant growth in digital revenues,” he said.In his resignation letter, Mr Riccitiello said the company had fallen short on internal targets set a year ago. Current quarter revenues and earnings were expected to come in at the low end of guidance given in January or slightly below.“This is a tough decision, but it all comes down to accountability …EA’s shareholders and employees expect better and I am accountable for the miss,” he wrote.EA revealed in a regulatory filing that Mr Riccitiello would continue to receive his salary for the next two years as well as take advantage of share options beyond his departure date.EA shares rose nearly 6 per cent to $19.79 in extended trading on the news of the chief executive’s departure.Earlier on Monday the company announced that its latest PC game, SimCity, had sold 1.1m units in its first two weeks, with 54 per cent of sales coming in digital downloads.However, it made no mention of anger among gamers at network crashes that left the game unplayable for many at the launch.Mr Pachter dismissed speculation on Twitter that the problems with SimCity had led to Mr Riccitiello's replacement.“They've shipped a pretty good number [of units] …you don’t get fired for that,” he said.EA is best known for its sports franchises such as Madden NFL and Fifa soccer. Mr Riccitiello put an emphasis on increasing digital revenues through download services, subscriptions and sales of virtual goods. IIn January, EA reported digital sales grew 37 per cent to $1.5bn in the previous 12 months.
48;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2013-02-01T22:08:59Z;Argentina’s Globant: international innovation;;"MIT, Stanford and Harvard may have written case studies about his company but Martín Migoya, CEO of Globant, an Argentine-based design- and innovation-focused technology service provider, is not big on business plans.In fact, he and three friends hatched their vision for the company, in which leading communications group WPP recently bought a 20 per cent stake for $70m, in a bar in Buenos Aires with no business plan in sight.Instead, they had two central ideas: to provide innovation, drawing on a pool of creative Latin talent; and to focus sales on America and Europe, rather than Latin America. A business plan eventually became necessary, Migoya concedes, once they needed to raise capital, but “nothing replaces a clear concept. There’s no business plan that can better that.”Globant turns 10 this year. It may not – yet – be a household name, but chances are, you’ll have had more contact with the company than you think, or at least your children will. It has worked on development of popular video and online games, including FIFA, Godfather II and Kung Fu Panda World, for example, with big name partners including Electronic Arts and Dreamworks.Indeed, it boasts an impressive list of clients, among them Google, Cisco, JP Morgan Chase, Travelocity, Coca-Cola, LinkedIn, Moneygram, BBVA, National Geographic and American Express. Its website, like the company, makes technogeekdom look cool, where a quirky cartoon of a jet-propelled surfer shows how it can help companies “surf the technology wave”, illustrating more clearly than thousands of words of corporate IT-speak about “solutions” exactly what Globant offers: innovative software products appealing to global audiences.The obvious next step for a company which trumpets its grand ambitions – “Think Big” is one of its six core values (“Have Fun” is another) – is an IPO, something the company has been talking about for a while.A stock market float would make it the first transnational Latin technology company, but Globant is biding its time, waiting for the right market conditions. “It’s always on our radar… we think it would be really important,” says Migoya, though he adds: “I can’t talk in detail.”Globant, which has garnered financial backing from Riverwood Capital, FTV Capital and entrepreneur promotion group Endeavour, has, meanwhile, been expanding. “I’m a fanatic of organic growth,” Migoya says, adding that coming acquisitions will be “strategic and very focused” – like its recent forays into Brazil and the US.As a privately-held company, Globant does not detail its finances. But it says turnover in the first half of 2012 was $56.9m, after $90m in 2011.In October last year, Globant bought Brazil’s TerraForum, a software and innovation company with a similar corporate ethos, in a deal Migoya said at the time meant Globant was “moving forward towards our goal of building a multinational company, opening and conquering markets all over the world”.In August 2011, it bought San Francisco-based Nextive, beefing up its mobile applications division and ticking another globally aspirational box – creating job opportunities in the US as part of its drive for a company fostering talent worldwide.The WPP deal “shows where we want to go” says Migoya, in making Globant a much more integrated company, and expects it to help raise the company’s profile.It has learned a lot from Google, one of its oldest clients. Just as Googlers staff the search engine and web company, Migoya employs some 2,500 “Globers”, whose open-plan office boasts a ping-pong table in the canteen, inspiration areas like a pit filled with colourful balls, a chill-out room complete with electric guitars and whiteboards for scribbling ideas should inspiration strike. “Creative people need creative spaces, happy spaces,” Migoya chuckles.Not everything has worked out. Migoya mentions deals done by Globant in Asia, which didn’t go well and lacked scale. In Mexico, another big Latin American market, meanwhile, the company still has only a small presence.But as well as eight locations in Argentina – it is committed to spreading talent within countries as well as internationally, allowing its staff, say, to return to their hometowns to work – it also has operations in Montevideo, Bogotá, San Francisco, Boston, Austin and London.“Globant wants to be a global player and to be the best in the world,” Migoya says, simply. And his corporate logo proclaims: “We are ready.”Related reading:

49;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2013-01-30T14:04:49Z;MBA 2013;Could an MBA help you in your career? Find out what our experts had to say;"As the economic uncertainty continues, prospective students and business school deans alike are increasingly nervous about the future of the full-time MBA.So, what will 2013 hold? As the cost of study continues to rise, will fewer managers decide to return to business school to study for a full-time degree, preferring instead to study on part-time or online programmes? Will business schools be able to fill their classes? And the biggest question for prospective students, Is a full-time MBA still worth the money?On Wednesday 30th January, 2013, a panel of experts answered your questions about studying for an MBA.On the panel were:Sir Andrew Likierman, dean of London Business School – ranked number four in the FT Global MBA rankings 2013.As well as his role of dean of LBS, Prof Likierman is non-executive chairman of the National Audit Office and a non-executive director of Barclays Bank. Before becoming dean, he was founding director of the school’s Executive MBA programme. He has also run a textile plant in Germany, been head of the Government Accountancy Service and was a managing director of the UK Treasury.Deirdre (Dee) Leopold, managing director, MBA admissions and financial aid at Harvard Business School – ranked number one in the FT Global MBA rankings 2013.Ms Leopold has been a member of Harvard Business School’s admissions board for more than 30 years. A graduate of Columbia University, she earned her MBA in 1980 from HBS, where she was co-president of the Women’s Student Association. Before attending HBS, she worked in New York City as a portfolio manager at Merrill Lynch.Jeremy Lemer, MBA student at the Wharton school at the University of Pennsylvania – ranked number three in the FT Global MBA rankings 2013.A former Financial Times journalist, Mr Lemer is a participant on the first year of the Wharton MBA. He studied journalism at Columbia University in New York then moved to Japan for 18 months before joining the FT, where he worked as US business correspondent.Jessica Henry, university relations manager at Electronic Arts.Ms Henry is responsible for identifying and creating opportunities within Electronic Arts to support the recruitment of MBA talent. Before joining EA in 2011, she was director of employer development at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Della Bradshaw, FT Business Education Editor——————————————————————————————–I’m a 42 year old Nigerian working in a bank though not as a manager, with less than seven years in the industry. Prior to that, I have similar years in the capital market as a regulator. In all, I have 17 years experience. I’m a certified accountant and am presently undertaking a European masters degree in finance by distance learning.I’m considering an MBA on completion of the masters, to boost my career and position me for a leadership role. Is the MBA all I need? I have been a regular admirer of the rankings since 2008 and have closely monitored and admired the top 100. What is your advice? Should I opt for the MBA either on a full time basis or by distance learning or think of leadership programmes? I even hold an offer from one of the top 100 schools in the 2011 ranking.Mohammed UmarDella: This is a really difficult question, but I think the one avenue you have have not explored is that of an executive MBA or EMBA, which would probably be more in line with your qualifications and experience. I realise there may be logistical issues here, but there are a growing number of strong business schools in Africa - Lagos Business School is one example.If you prefer to study full-time then a further option might be a degree such as the Sloan Fellows programme, which is a one-year intensive programme for more senior managers. Then again, there are several one-year MBA degrees that enrol students with an average age of 30 or more, rather than the usual 27 or 28, though these would tend to be in Europe rather than the US.Dee: The MBA programme at HBS is a full-time two-year programe conducted in Boston. We offer only one degree - the MBA. The programme is truly full-time and students should not expect to be employed while matriculated.When considering a mid-career educational programme, applicants should do their due diligence about whether a programme can meet their expectations. Age is not a factor in the admissions process but we expect that candidates with more extensive experience will have a clear idea of whether this is a wise financial and professional decision.Andrew: Different programmes at different schools can suit the needs of a huge variety of candidates. Choosing the right programme to suit your own needs is therefore critical. For a start, it sounds as if you should consider the offer you’ve already received.At London Business School, we don’t offer a distance learning programme for a number of reasons. Our strengths, we believe, lie in our location in London, the personal interactions between outstanding individuals in the class and through our 80 clubs and the networks that are created.While studying for an MBA seems to be very useful for one’s career as well as being personally fulfilling and occasionally fun, I have the impression it mostly considers younger people. Your MBA magazine, for example, mentions an average (!) pre-MBA age of 28 (and consequently an average 3 year post-MBA age of 33).Being 48, with 20 years of investment banking experience under my belt, should I feel discouraged by this statistic, or are there even better reasons to take the opposite view?FYI, I am no longer actively involved in investment banking and am not sure I desire a return to the industry for now for several reasons. However, I also think it is too early for, what is effectively becoming, a retirement. I would think my sales and financial experience provides valuable transferable skills that should find good use, so I am tempted to look into doing an MBA. And the GMAT test sounds like an interesting start. I am just not sure about my age gap and how this, and my (nowadays probably rather common) career background would affect my own marketability?Frank LeopoldJessica: Hello Frank. Studying for – and completing – an MBA should be fulfilling both professionally and personally, though it is often the decisions you make now that will ensure it is indeed fulfilling for you and for your personal situation.You have the averages and statistics; now put those aside for a moment and ask yourself what you are seeking to get from an MBA programme. Perhaps, even before that, ask what you are seeking from your next career path. You have got part of the way there - you want to leverage your sales and financial experience – now finish that sentence and think about where you want to leverage those skills. What function, what industry is the next stop on your career journey?Once you have that goal you can then take another look at what gaps you might have in your skill sets and experiences. It is when you have a clear goal and when you have those skill gaps determined, that you can determine how to fill those gaps. Maybe you will determine an MBA is the way to fill those gaps and support your next move and your next step is exploring programmes and options; you will have a much richer experience if you ensure you define your purpose and goal for getting an MBA if that is the case.Now to talk briefly about the averages you mention: a large number of students in MBA programmes do have a few years of work experience behind them and are indeed seeking a career change, whether that change be function, industry or geography. As such, there is much attention paid to that career exploration during many MBA programmes, almost working from a blank sheet of paper to ask the question: “Where are my skills, where is my passion, what I have learned, what do I want to continue to learn?” - as well as exposure to various careers paths, industries and functions.This reflection and exploration is critical to ensuring that all individuals who go on an MBA programme go with a goal in mind, refine that goal as they are in the programme, and thus truly invest in their own personal goals and journey. Whether you decide to do a part-time programme or full-time programme – and there are now so many ways in which you can study and be part of the MBA community – ensuring you are doing that reflection and exploration is key to ensure the MBA is fulfilling to you.Della: Yes, full-time MBA students are around 27 or 28 on average, but executive MBAs are designed for managers with your level of experience and can be completed in two years or less. One to consider, perhaps?Jeremy: A couple of people have asked about whether it makes sense for them to apply for an MBA given that they are a little bit older and MBA programmes tend to focus on younger students. In general, you are absolutely right – MBA programmes are increasingly taking younger students with only a couple of years of work experience. Harvard for example offers a 2+2 programme aimed at undergraduates.For what it is worth, I see this as a mistake. Younger students have less to contribute in class and get less out of the course because they don’t know what they want to learn. Conversely, older students have extensive real-life experience and know exactly what they want to learn.The big issue for you is less whether you would get into an MBA programme but what you might hope to get out of it. Here I am thinking of two points: earnings power and job opportunities.First, MBA’s are expensive and with less of your career ahead of you, you stand to benefit less from the boost in earnings that normally accompanies such a degree. Also, as an older applicant you are probably starting from a higher base which would also dampen any earnings effect.Second, potential employers might view older MBA candidates differently than they do younger MBAs. Perhaps one of the other panelists has a view about whether they would be willing to take someone in their 40s into a post-MBA graduate programme.If you do decide to apply I would encourage you to look closely at an executive MBA. The advantage of an executive MBA is that you can work while you study. That might be more comfortable given the gap since your last college experience.I would also tackle the issue of your age head on in your personal essays – laying out the reasons why you would be a valuable candidate. Strong points in your favour include: a wealth of practical experience, professional maturity and real commitment. Good luck.Andrew: Have you considered programmes specifically aimed at people in senior/leadership positions? For example at London Business School, we offer the Sloan Masters programme for people changing their careers and a range of executive education programmes aimed at people who are further into their career than most MBA students.It is also really important that you select a programme with a peer group that you can learn from who have similar levels of experience.With so much economic uncertainty and world shrinking when it comes to places with good work opportunities, do you think that business schools need to formulate full-time MBA programmes with lesser classroom credits and more hands on experience, thereby giving more time to students to devote to their careers post MBA and bring down tuition cost as well?AbhishekAndrew: The two are not mutually exclusive. Good business schools will have a combination of teaching and opportunities to gain experience. You need to find the programme that suits your own needs. We’re proud at London Business School to be able to offer many opportunities of this kind. For example, our MBA global business experience give students the opportunity to go to one of five cities around the world to get under the skin of doing business in another culture.Della: I think the key is to give both a rigorous academic experience and hands-on experience, isn’t it? The issue is how to do that in as little time as possible, thus keeping down both tuition and opportunity costs. Many of the top schools are very experienced at building this into their pedagogy; groupwork where students discuss academic topics while learning persuasion techniques and how to work in a multicultural team is very common these days, particularly in the accelerated one-year programmes.Jessica: Your MBA experience can be both – practical experience in the form of an internship, project, or cooperative opportunity – as well as classroom experience. I encourage you not to underestimate the classroom experience. This is your opportunity to dive into problems, debate, question, try and fail and try again…in a relatively safe environment.The classroom (however you may define “classroom” whether it is physical brick-and-mortar, an online experience, or even just a quick chat in the hallway before the professor starts to talk) is where you learn to question, ask the right questions, and thus devise the best, most creative solutions.And just as the classroom supports the work experience, work experience should support the classroom. You gain a network in internship. People who can speak to the skills you have developed because they were working alongside you as you put them into practice. The work experience is almost like the final performance while the classroom can be a bit of a dress rehearsal as you tweak, rethink, reevaluate, revise. You need both the preparation and the performance for a successful run.So in short: No, I do not think that business schools need us to tell them to reformulate. The schools on this list are known for innovation and adaptability and again – thought leadership – both in teaching and management. I know the leaders of all programmes continue to evaluate future direction and immediate path, and I have no doubt will continue to tailor offerings and programmes to continue to offer excellent educational experiences for the myriad professionals that can benefit from an MBA.Would you recommend an MBA for somebody who has no background in business? Is an MBA a good choice for somebody who is unsure of what they would like to study?Ariha SetalvadDee: We have students in the MBA programme at HBS who come from a wide variety of previous experiences, including the military, education, pure science and government, for example. What they have in common is a desire for a general management education which will ground them in all the areas of business.The majority of our cases will be about for-profit enterprises. Our students can then apply this learning to many different fields. We seek students who will be enthusiastically engaged in classroom discussions about how businesses thrive or flounder. We want them to dig in to the case about the company they have never heard of in the industry they don’t particularly care about – and find this to be enjoyable. We are preparing students not just for their first post-MBA job but for a long career which may span multiple industries and functions.Della: I think the short answer to that is no. However, Masters in Management degrees have been specifically designed for those with no previous business experience. A more general concern…..these degrees are very expensive and may not be particularly useful to anyone who is unsure what they want to study.Andrew: To start with I advise prospective students to talk to current or past students because they are in a great position to give you the best picture. Over the years, I have seen how coming to business school has been a life changing experience for so many of the students. Many come having an objective in mind but discover whole new worlds of which they were not aware. That is on top of the learning experience, the activities outside the classroom and the valuable networks they join.Diversity in the classroom is not just welcomed, it is sought after. Together with bankers, consultants and engineers, we take students from very different walks of life. For example, a few years ago, we admitted a concert pianist without any experience in corporate life. He went to Goldman Sachs on completion of his MBA.Current students include an astronaut, a professional American footballer, an oil tanker captain, many people who come from military backgrounds in several different countries and a woman running an NGO in Afghanistan.Jessica: While you might be unsure of what you want to study, spend time thinking more about why you want to get your MBA and what your ultimate goal for getting your MBA is. You do not get into your car and not know what your final destination is; you get in, and while you might take a linear or circuitous course, you eventually make it to your final destination, or you redefine the destination during the course. But you got in that car with a purpose.While such a simplified analogy – driving to the store versus investing in an MBA – think of it similarly. What do you want to get out of this journey and then does an MBA programme fit that ultimate goal? There will be plenty of time for flexibility and exploration when you get into the programme, but knowing your core values and core reasons for attending will ground that flexibility in action and success.And there are many students who enter an MBA programme without a background in business – that is part of the dynamics of an MBA community! In my role at Electronic Arts, we meet students with backgrounds in engineering, sports and fine arts. That is probably one of my favorite aspects of an MBA programme – whether it be full-time or part-time – the diversity in experience that you and your classmates will bring.Jeremy: I think the MBA is a good choice for somebody who doesn’t have a business background but is keen to learn more about the business world.For my part, I was a journalist for five years so the course has been a great introduction to the tool kit that you will need to succeed in business: accounting, finance, marketing and so on. My general impression is that an MBA is a hybrid degree – combining some interesting ideas, practical training and a great networking opportunity.If you are looking for a real intellectual challenge or in depth technical training, I think it probably makes more sense to pick a specialist degree or a professional qualification that you can take while working.I would think about one final point before applying. While students often choose to do an MBA in order to change careers, it can be more difficult to achieve in practice, particularly for those without math-heavy backgrounds. In my experience, an MBA by itself is not enough to convince employers of your business acumen. They look at your resume, your undergraduate training, etc quite closely. So if you are hoping to shift industry or function or both, be prepared for plenty of setbacks and a lot of hard work.Do employers favour a full-time MBA over a part-time executive MBA programme?Joseph MarkowskiAndrew: For many schools, such as London Business School, the qualification is the same, with only the format being different. Most employers know about business education qualifications and are clear who they are hiring and why. Executive MBAs give participants the opportunity to apply what they’re learning immediately back into their job.Jessica: Your question illustrates that schools, particularly now, offer many ways in which to achieve an MBA. Full-time programmes, part-time programmes, executive MBA programmes, distance/online learning are sometimes all offered under the same school umbrella, and for good reason: these options allow potential students to think about their own purpose and goals for an MBA, as well as their own personal life situation, and find an MBA offering that fits all of those. As with many things, having a choice is fantastic, though it does put more responsibility on you as the applicant to really do your research and make the right choice for you.To address specifically your question on employer interest: If we were having a live conversation, I would ask you what industry or functional subset of employers interest you. There are industries and companies that are known for incredible post-MBA programmes, and those programmes are the primary MBA feed into the organisation. They bring associate classes into their organisation and have strong development tracks that then foster individual growth. The recruitment process then reflects the company and companies will often look to hire an intern class that will eventually convert into their full-time class post-graduation, and start their recruitment process very early.If you are seeking to transition into investment banking, for example, I would encourage you then to look at MBA programmes that have strong partnerships in the investment banking industry and a strong recruitment partnership, which will often include networking events, on-campus recruitment and on-site visits or treks.Also, think about the career track of particular industries or organisations. To transition into a career in investment banking, for example, a full-time internship is often a traditional part of that path, both to gain critical skills and a network within the investment banking community.Think about your personal situation as well as the MBA programmes you are seeking; doing a full-time internship on top of a part-time MBA programme…on top of another full-time career that the part-time programme really facilitates seems, well, just exhausting and nearly impossible. Know your goals when applying, and find the right school – and right programme within that school – when you apply.Within the interactive entertainment industry, Electronic Arts is an example of an organisation that seeks analytical talent and future leaders that are often found in an MBA graduate. While some of our positions might be identified early in the year – on par with our colleagues in investment banking and consulting – still many roles will be developed and determined throughout the year.We are a changing industry and thus a changing organisation and we seek talent to help us lead that change. The recruitment process for many of our MBAs will seem similar to that of a traditional or experienced hire and we then do not necessarily look at how you got your MBA, but what you got out of that MBA and why you got it.Does our organisation and position for which you are applying fit those “what” and “why?” That is what we are seeking in candidates. In addition, we know that an executive MBA will perhaps not be looking at the same role as a newly minted full-time MBA – and we seek both skill sets in the organisation. It is then your responsibility to tell your story in a way that connects your story to where EA is going and what talent we are seeking.Della: An MBA and an EMBA are intended for managers with different levels of experience, and the latter usually only happens if the student’s company is supportive. Therefore, I think it really is a question of horses for courses.How would you describe what doing an MBA is like?ArihaDella: Well, if you want to find out the sort of subjects you might study, take a look at the FT’s MBA gyms.I work in education management and I am interested in studying for an MBA but don’t know if an MBA is geared towards / relevant to someone in my field? In your experience do many people from education undertake an MBA?Jessica MonkivitchJeremy: I don’t have the exact statistics to hand but personal experience suggests that it is quite a common move. In my year group at Wharton there are a number of people with a background in education – either as teachers, administrators or policy wonks.My impression is that for some of them, the math component of the course can be a little challenging but they often bring a lot to the table in other areas: teamwork, project management, emotional intelligence, etc.And it seems as though they are enjoying the course as well as getting a lot out of it. One or two friends are interested in developing educational IT / software businesses while others are looking to change careers and move into consulting or other professional sectors.Andrew: I can give a specific example. When I was director of the Executive MBA a head teacher applied for the programme because she felt that this would be very important in her ability to work in education management. She went on to become head teacher of one of the largest schools in the UK and then to be chief executive of the NSPCC. Her name is Dame Mary Marsh and I’m proud of the contribution London Business School made to her career path.Della: Hi Jessica. Yes, indeed. What all business schools are seeing these days are more applicants from non-corporate backgrounds but where good management is increasingly valued - health services, education, charities and government departments, for example.At Stanford, for example, one in six of its MBA students are now studying on a different Stanford degree at the same time as studying business, and at Oxford University the Saïd school now has a 1+1 system with the education department where participants study one year in the department of education and then a second year on the MBA.Jessica: I would take a look at the number of MBAs who are in education management to perhaps answer your question and I do think you will be pleasantly surprised. Education, whether it be for-profit or not-for-profit, needs the core skills that are foundational to MBA curriculum including leadership, management, finance, economics, marketing, communication and this is evident also in leaders in the educational industry.Electronic Arts – an interactive entertainment company with a structure that would (and does) obviously lend itself to the MBA skill set – boasts many brilliant leaders from many of the programmes listed on the FT rankings. Similarly, I worked alongside educational leaders at Chicago Booth who also had an MBA in their professional repertoire, and thus put to use the same guiding foundation and skills that my EA colleagues do on a daily basis in order to make strategic decisions.The MBA is thought leadership. It is a powerful network and community. It is cutting edge research and both immediate and long-term application. I cannot think of many industries that would not benefit from this.I would like to know about the opportunities available for international applicants in funding their MBA in the UK. I have heard that due to the market situation and changes in UK immigration rules, it is very difficult for an MBA-aspirant (non-UK permanent resident) to secure a student loan within UK.I would appreciate the thoughts of the panel members on how this will affect international students aiming at b-schools like LBS? Also, what steps are taken (or incentives given) by these UK b-schools to still encourage/attract international applicants?Della: A few years ago there were several banks that funded MBA students in the UK but all these schemes have now closed down. This is a particular problem in the UK as most business schools do not have the scholarship schemes in place like their US counterparts.Some schools have negotiated loan schemes for their schools - several use the company Prodigy, set up by two Insead alumni, that uses a bond scheme to finance students on the top programmes. You would need to contact individual schools to find out what provision they have in place. This article on finance might help.Which school, in your collective opinions, has the best reputation for venture capital or offers a good programme or speciality in that field?Jamie RowlesJessica: While Electronic Arts is not under the venture capital umbrella, your question can be related to many industries, as students with a defined career goal in mind then look to find the right programme that will facilitate that goal.I have mentioned previously that the recruitment process of a firm often reflects the industry and/or company, and this is incredibly true with venture capital. Know that you need the core quantitative and analytics skills for a career in VC, and seek a programme that has the curricular offering to fill gaps you might bring into the programme in that space.How much control do you have in determining your curriculum throughout your studies? Do you have the flexibility to choose a course that will essentially create a VC track for yourself, or is there a defined VC track within a programme that is more appealing to you? When looking at MBA programmes, look not only at curriculum strength, but how it is then offered and packaged to you.This is also an excellent time to talk about the network that you are joining when you join an MBA programme, and again reference that the recruitment process reflects the industry. You are joining a powerful network and community when you choose to accept an offer of admission to an MBA programme, and hopefully via your research and perhaps campus visits, you have made the decision that it is the right community for you.You will network heavily to get your first job in venture capital (and network heavily once you are in the venture capital industry!) Is the MBA programme at which you are looking a good pool for that networking? What student organisations exist that will help build not only peer-to-peer connections, but industry connections? What is the school doing with partnerships in the VC industry?And, to briefly mention geography, there are simply some regions that are headquarters of industries. While networking can always be done globally, it is incredibly easier to grab coffee with someone for a quick networking conversation when they are within 50 miles of you. This does not mean you are locked in a geography for the venture capital industry, but may mean you’ll want to earmark a bit of money for some travel to support your networking.Dee: HBS alumni and faculty were early participants in the venture capital space and thus have engendered a tradition of HBS leadership. We are the only programme to require a first-year course in entrepreneurship and our new required course, FIELD, has a module in which students work in small teams creating an operating micro-business. 25 percent of the partners in venture capital firms worldwide are HBS alumni.I’m contemplating studying for a post-graduate business course and I would like to run my own tech start-up in the future. I am really interested in entrepreneurship. What is more important when it comes to making my choice - should I go for a top ranked MBA school with a well-known brand name or should I go for a Masters in Entrepreneurship?Dee: An entrepreneur needs to be a general manager on day one since start-ups will not have the resources to hire functional expertise in all areas. You may wish to explore general management programmes v specialising.Della: If you are convinced you know exactly what you want to do then go for a specialised masters degree - entrepreneurship, finance, marketing. If you want to hedge your bets - go for an MBA.Andrew: Delighted to see this question. In starting your own business you need the tools as well as the examples of what has happened to other start-ups. We have many people at London Business School who go on to start their own businesses on the MBA programme and the knowledge they gain in finance, risk analysis and the management of people has proved to be invaluable.In the first year of the MBA, all students take a class called ‘Discovering Entrepreneurial Opportunities’ and there is the opportunity to take other entrepreneurship courses and participate in the Entrepreneurship Summer School where they can test out ideas with other entrepreneurs and investors. To add to that, we have recently set up an incubator for those just graduated to help put those ideas into practice.Jessica: Rankings support the MBA decision but – with all due respect to my hosts – they should not drive the decision. As with any decision, you want to gather the full picture of an MBA programme, including the rankings and the “why” behind the rankings, and apply it to your own personal situation. So use the rankings as a factor in your decision making, but not the factor; you need to then create your own personal rankings that will not likely mirror exactly a published list.MBA programmes do house incredible start-up incubators. I hesitate to even call them “programmes” as these are almost a business-within-a-business-school that supports students and alumni thought leadership and supports their start-up ventures (full disclosure: I worked closely with the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship while at Chicago Booth and have a strong affinity for that programme).Remember to get from your MBA studies the core skills you need in your entrepreneurial ventures, which might include organisational leadership, negotiation and contracts and business development. But if you are truly ready to start your own business, why not look at programmes that will support that from day one and beyond.I am a CPA from India with 11 years of experience in finance, accounts, audit, taxation and treasury across various industries under the banking and financial services sector. I feel my career has stagnated. I would like move into corporate finance and consulting, hence I want to go for an MBA. I am 36 years old.Given the average age of MBA students ranging from 27 to 29 at top business schools, do older ages play a crucial factor for admission into a top business school? I am looking to specialise in a Masters in Finance at London Business School as well.Mahesh JoshiDella: One of the recurrent themes in many of today’s questions seems to be whether an MBA is an appropriate degree for those in their thirties and forties. What is clear is that for most managers, education is front-loaded, for those in their twenties.Increasingly though, as retirement ages increase and we all work longer, business schools are going to be faced with these issues. Twenty years ago, those in their fifties were on the steady slope to retirement; these days they may have another 20 years to work and may need to reskill at least once along the way. I think this is one of the most pressing questions for university-based business schools.The Financial Times rankings always evaluate research as part of the MBA. How will this help get me a job?Jeremy: To be honest, a school’s research rank won’t have a direct effect on your ability to get a job. No-one is going to hire you because they read a great paper by a professor who teaches on your MBA programme.But research indirectly affects your ability to get a job in two ways. First, research is important in building up the prestige and reputation of a business school. And the Harvard or Wharton MBA brand certainly makes you more attractive to employers.Second, at the margin better research may translate into better teaching. It is possible, although I haven’t seen any data on this point, that a faculty that conducts cutting edge research may be able to better prepare their students in the latest business strategies and techniques.Jessica: You – yourself - will inarguably play the largest role in shaping your MBA experience; your professors will take the next largest role. Just as I have talked about finding your own passion in determining your MBA programme and career path (I will likely ask about your career passion if I interview you for a role at EA!), you want to learn and work alongside professors who are passionate about their field, and spend time inside and outside the classroom investing in that passion.So when looking at schools, certainly look at the depth of research of its professors, but also the passion towards teaching that can be seen by sitting in a classroom. You seek a balance of pedagogy, practicality and research.Della: That’s one of those questions that really divides people. To begin with, the FT has been ranking MBA programmes for the past 15 years, and every year we ask alumni why they chose to study for an MBA. The answer is always the same - effectively to get a better job. Therefore I think it is justifiable to ask why business schools invest so much in academic research, possibly at the cost of career services.My answer is threefold. First, business school professors usually conduct research with companies. This forges links with the corporate world that can be invaluable when students are looking for jobs. Second, this published research can enhance the reputation of the school, and reputation, however you define that, is one of the attributes prospective students and recruiters look for in a business school. Third, I have no doubt that the best teaching is that informed with the latest research, rather than that taught from a textbook. This is the difference between a good business school and a REALLY good business school."
50;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-12-17T17:13:24Z;WPP buys Filmworks China;;WPP, the global marketing services group, has expanded its presence in China with the acquisition of Filmworks China, a marketing firm whose clients include Electronic Arts and DreamWorks.The move is part of a continued strategy by the advertising giant, run by chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell, to expand its reach into faster growing emerging markets.In October the company announced that it had agreed to buy a majority stake in ArtM Communications Group, a Chinese agency employing about 180 people. China is currently the third-largest market for WPP with revenues of $1.3bn and total staff of 14,500.WPP’s Xaxis digital advertising group is also expanding into China, and is the first significant push by a global advertising company to bring data analytics and digital ad buying technologies to the fast-growing Chinese market.Earlier this month, WPP announced the appointment of Bessie Lee to the newly created position of chief executive of WPP China.Previously head of GroupM China, the local arm of the group’s media buying division, Ms Lee has been charged with helping to identify new business opportunities as well as potential acquisitions and investments.According to Clarity, a corporate finance adviser specialising in media, WPP made 133 acquisitions from 2008 through to September of this year.Across the advertising sector as a whole, China was the third most important market for mergers and acquisitions, accounting for 10 per cent of activity, Clarity calculates. The key Bric economies, encompassing Brazil, Russia, India and China, comprised 24 per cent of all deals.In the year to the end of December 2011, Filmworks recorded revenues of Rmb12m. The purchase price was undisclosed.
51;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-12-07T21:59:30Z;Console games drowning by numbers;;Even another record-breaking Call of Duty could not rescue the US video game industry from a twelfth consecutive month of declining software sales in November, according to the latest official figures from the NPD research firm.But the “packaged goods” disc sales are only a part of the picture, now that we have digital and social and mobile games to take into account. Judging by announcements from Facebook and DeNA this week, hard-core gamers seem just as likely nowadays to be competing in these new gaming territories.First, the NPD numbers. Software sales for consoles were down 11 per cent year-on-year and PC software was down 38 per cent. Call of Duty:Black Ops II sold 7.5m units, but this was down 13 per cent on last year’s episode – Modern Warfare 3, which was released earlier – on November 8 2011 – versus November 13 2012 for Black Ops. Microsoft’s Halo 4 and Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed III attracted more hard-core dollars, with 3.2m and 2.9m unit sales respectively.Software sales for the new Wii U were “baffling”, according to Cowen and Company analysts, at $23m – only about half their expectations and with console sales of 425,000 units not too far behind the original Wii’s debut with 475,000.The Xbox 360 stayed on top for the 23rd consecutive month in the US, selling 1.26m units.Electronic Arts showcased its forthcoming console games at a media event in San Francisco on Wednesday and all five featured were hard-core shoot-’em-ups.Details of three are under embargo until later this month, but the other two are Crysis 3, launching February 19 and featuring the incredibly lush and detailed graphics (pictured left) for which the Crytek studio is famed, and Army of TWO The Devil’s Cartel, coming March 26, and including hip-hop stars Big Boi and B.o.B as characters and soundtrack providers for the game.At a similar event in the city on Tuesday, the winter showcase of DeNA, the Japanese mobile social gaming company, also featured hard-core games. The Drowning (pictured) made by its Scattered Entertainment studio in Sweden was the star of the show.The Drowning is a first-person shooter for the iPhone and iPad with a post-Apocalypse survivalist theme. It will be free-to-play with the ability to buy virtual goods.This “freemium” hard-core trend is being pursued because hard-core gamers spend much more money than casual ones, judging by the success of hard-core publishers such as Kixeye.DeNA bought the San Francisco-based iPhone publisher ngmoco two years ago and Clive Downie, ngmoco chief executive (pictured left), also oversees DeNA’s Mobage West, which he describes as “the leading mobile social gaming platform in the West”.Globally, Mobage has registered users in 191 countries and paying users in 135 of them. In the top-grossing charts, it has six games in the top 50 for the Android platform and three in the top 25 for iOS.“Our games are played on average 45 minutes a day across the Mobage platform,” he told me in an interview.“‘Freemium is what we identified two years ago as the future and it is much easier to monetise when you have that engagement of people coming back every day and being able to establish a relationship with them.”Facebook noted the rise of hard-core this week with a list of the top 20 social games of 2012, based on engagement levels and star ratings.“It was a big year for action/arcade games…with most of the apps falling into the relatively new category,” it said in a blog post.But casual can still be king – the 2012 number-one is SongPop, a music trivia game.
52;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-10-14T18:05:20Z;Social media adverts turf war heats up;;"It is five months since General Motors last spent a cent on Facebook advertising. The US carmaker’s revelation in May that the $10m it spent on ads had failed to deliver returns stunned the social network on the eve of its initial public offering. Facebook is yet to win back the carmaker’s business.But GM – one of the world's largest advertisers – is no social-media refusenik. Its brands, such as Chevrolet, Buick and GMC, have been actively buying ads on Facebook's main challenger, Twitter, for two years now.Andrew Dinsdale, Chevrolet's director of digital and CRM, says of the microblogging site: “It’s a unique medium and offers us unique opportunities to engage customers in the social space on a level no one else can match in this particular way.”“From research, we know that Twitter users really care about what’s happening with businesses,” Mr Dinsdale adds. Chevy has seen response rates to Twitter ads of typically between 1 and 3 per cent. ""That’s several orders of magnitude higher than traditional online display advertising.""GM’s endorsement of Twitter is a powerful one in the growing turf war between the leading social media firms, which are pushing out many new capabilities for marketers in recent months.As competition grows, a once-collaborative energy among the top social networks is fizzling out as they each compete to maintain their own slice of the internet landscape.Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social media sites are increasingly at war, shutting down channels of data-sharing and cross-promotion, and copying each other’s features as they seek to be more independent and to capture more of their users’ time.""All of them are under intense pressure,"" says Jed Williams, an analyst at BIA/Kelsey. For Facebook and LinkedIn, being public companies ""fundamentally changes the way you think about growth,"" he adds.Although it was bruised by GM, Facebook can point to positive results from other global brands such as Electronic Arts, which attributed $12.1m in incremental sales from Facebook around the launch of its Battlefield 3 game, according to EA data shared by Facebook.GM and EA sit at opposite extremes; Facebook states that on average, 70 per cent of brand marketers see a return of at least three times their investment.One big advantage Facebook can flaunt is its scale, with 1bn active users dwarfing Twitter's 140m.“Facebook's reach is unprecedented – every day a brand has the ability to reach half a billion people – the equivalent of almost five Super Bowl audiences,” says Brad Smallwood, Facebook's head of measurements and insights. “That's very important for marketers because reach drives sales.”Yet Facebook’s large scale has led to suggestions that it is throwing its weight around, competing with some of the many developers that operate on its vast platform.Its introduction of a “want” button last week – which allows users to add images of clothing or homewares shared by retailers to a “collection” or “wishlist” on their own profile page – was widely seen as an attempt to head off competition from Pinterest, the online scrapbooking community which has seen rapid growth over the past year.In another social-media skirmish, Twitter last month ended its users’ ability to funnel all their tweets to a connected LinkedIn account, one of several such moves that has raised eyebrows in Silicon Valley.Within weeks, LinkedIn responded in kind, rolling out the ability to “follow” public figures, such as Barack Obama.Eventually, LinkedIn will expand the number of people who can be followed, just one of a series of new features, all reminiscent of facets of Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr.“They are indeed beginning to mirror each other,” says Norm Johnston, a global digital leader at Mindshare Worldwide, a WPP agency.Compared with Facebook, Mr Johnston says Twitter's simpler set of features can limit its appeal for the more “emotive” online experiences that consumer goods brands want.“However, we're finding Twitter better at generating social spikes, PR and buzz,” he says. “Facebook doesn't really have that same instant dynamic.”Twitter's advantages come at a higher cost for marketers.“It's more expensive to get followers on Twitter than it is to get likes on Facebook,” says Simon Mansell, chief executive of TBG Digital, a social media agency, adding that the cost-per-click on Twitter also tends to be higher.Yet at an estimated $288m this year, according to eMarketer, Twitter’s advertising revenue is far smaller than Facebook's projected $4.23bn. Under pressure to narrow that gap, observers say Twitter is closing more and more doors in its previously wide-open system.Mr Williams at BIA/Kelsey says. “It’s tough to build a streamlined advertising experience for advertisers if you have to syndicate that across a host of third-party apps.”Adam Bain, Twitter’s head of revenue, denies that the effort to create what he describes as a “consistent experience for our users” has been driven by commercial motives.“It more has to do with when users sign up to immediately understand the value of Twitter,” he says, noting that Twitter still works with many external partners and developers. “Twitter is not an island, it’s a bridge …There’s a whole world inside of the tweet.”For now, Twitter can claim the advantage in generating more cash from its mobile activity, according to estimates from eMarketer. Twitter's ad revenue on mobile now exceeds its desktop income on a “pretty consistent” basis, says Mr Bain.“I guess a lot of people in this space talk about mobile being the future of advertising,” he says. “For Twitter it’s our present.”However, Twitter cannot afford to let up the competitive pressure – even sceptical GM could soon return to Facebook. A GM spokesman says that it is “very encouraged” by its “positive discussions” with Facebook."
53;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-09-21T13:33:59Z;Online push transforms Japan gaming;;"At last year’s Tokyo Game Show, a rich and fast-growing maker of social games for mobile phones called Gree stole attention, and space, from more established rivals by occupying one of the trade fair’s biggest booths in the centre of the exhibition hall.This year Gree, which was founded by Asia’s youngest self-made billionaire, Yoshikazu Tanaka, 35, is continuing its march on video games veterans such as Sony and Sega. But now its target is not their floor space but their core demographic of hardcore game players.“Our theme this time is the next step in the evolution of social games,” Taisei Yoshida, Gree’s senior vice-president in charge of media development, said in an interview at the start of the show this week. He outlined a strategy that is part of an intensifying battle for the centre of the $70bn video game market. “We want to get people who really like games to play social games on smartphones.”Gree’s rise, and its success in bringing social games to smartphones, stands in contrast to Zynga, its better-known Western rival. Gree’s $4.7bn market capitalisation on Friday is double that of Zynga’s $2.4bn. It had net profit of $613m on revenues of $2bn for the year ended June 30, compared to a net loss of $530.6m on sales of $1.27bn over the same period for Zynga.It was not too long ago that Japan’s video game world was divided into two distinct camps. In one were established companies such as Sony, Nintendo, Sega and Capcom, developer of the Street Fighter and Resident Evil franchises. They made fast-paced, graphic-rich games with budgets that sometimes approached those of Hollywood films.Some also built the sophisticated game consoles needed to play them, which they sold mostly to young men and boys whose zeal for gaming was such that they would spend, or prod their parents to spend, hundreds of dollars on software and gear.Lined up opposite were start-ups such as Gree and DeNA, its mobile-gaming rival. They made simple games – Gree and DeNA have fought lawsuits over the creative origins of virtual fishing – that could be played in short bursts by bored commuters on the train to work.Widespread mobile internet access meant these games could be downloaded easily, and often for free – extra charges accrue later – and played remotely with groups of friends, a model that has since become familiar to iPhone and Android phone users worldwide.Financially, the latter approach has been winning. Masato Araki, an analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley, expects revenues for Japanese social games groups to reach Y400bn next year, up nearly fourfold from 2011, even as their established rivals are struggling.Gree, and its other Asian peers, are also increasingly looking beyond their own borders to lure Western audiences. Gree earlier this year launched Zombie Jombie, its first smartphone game specifically developed for foreign audiences, and have recently opened offices in London. Nexon, the South Korean gaming company, sold more than 2m copies of its latest Guild Wars 2 game, which costs $60, within days of its US and European launch at the end of August.Yet the displays at this year’s Tokyo Game Show illustrate how industry divisions are breaking down. Gree was showcasing three games with roots in the world of joysticks and “fire” buttons: Biohazard and Metal Gear, a pair of gory first-person shooters, and World Cup Soccer, from US developer EA Sports.“There isn’t much difference in processing power between a smartphone and a portable game machine any more. It’s mainly a matter of adapting the controls,” Mr Yoshida said. “If hardcore gamers like it, they can have a lot of influence.”Phone versions of games such as Biohazard remain more basic than their console-and-television cousins, but the upside is they are cheaper to make. Mr Yoshida said Gree might spend Y100m-Y200m adapting or creating its most ambitious games; big console-oriented releases often cost 10 times that.Gree may also have been motivated to seek new kinds of players by a run-in with regulators this year. Japan’s consumer affairs agency banned one form of revenue-raising favoured by Japanese game groups, in which players are invited to wager small amounts of money on the chance to win in-game rewards, as being too close to illegal gambling. Sales slipped as a result, although not as much as some analysts had expected."
54;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-09-18T13:03:19Z;EA to create support hub in Ireland;;"Electronic Arts will almost double the size of its European customer support centre in Galway in a vote of confidence for Ireland’s bid to become a hub for the gaming sector.The move comes as a particular blow to the UK, which has been looking to attract more games company investment with the promise of tax breaks starting next year.In his budget earlier this year George Osborne, the UK chancellor, awarded the TV, animation and computer games industries tax breaks worth tens of millions of pounds. However the criteria for what games will qualify for tax breaks is still under discussion and it has been unclear whether the incentives will be enough for large companies like EA.The US games publisher said it would recruit an extra 300 jobs to push total employment to 700 at the Galway centre, which beat off competition from other cities in Britain, Europe and the US to win the investment.“Ireland has won and won handsomely despite the romancing of a lot of cities and countries worldwide,” Peter Moore, Electronic Arts chief operating officer told the Financial Times on Tuesday.“Galway met all of our criteria: the availability of a young educated workforce; an attractive lifestyle in the city for young workers; our ability to get in and train people; and government support for the jobs,” he said.Dublin is targeting inward investment from games companies to help it recover from an economic crisis which forced it to accept a €67.5bn bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. About 2,000 people are currently employed in the games sector in multinational companies such as Zynga and Blizzard. The Irish government has set a target of creating an extra 2,500 jobs by 2014.Barry O’Leary, chief executive of IDA Ireland, said the Republic is benefiting from a “strong cluster effect” created by the large number of internet companies that have chosen to base their European operations and support functions in the country.“Ireland has the top 10 internet companies in the world based here, the likes of Google, Twitter, Zynga and PayPal. We have something like 100 pan-European multilingual support centres and a large talent pool to tap into,” he said.He added that rival cities such as London were more expensive than Ireland.Dublin offers incentives such as its ultra low corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent, research and development tax breaks and the possibility of employment grants to companies willing to invest in the country. Electronic Arts centre in Galway is expected to benefit from employment grants to support job creation. Corporation tax is not considered a major incentive for customer support style operations.Electronic Arts, which is the publisher of the game Medal of Honour, owns PopCap Games, which employs almost 100 people in Dublin. But the company recently announced a strategic review of its Dublin office, which could lead to its closure."
55;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-09-17T21:38:04Z;Zynga gets A Bit Lucky;;Zynga has acquired the Silicon Valley game developer A Bit Lucky as it tries to attract players more eager to spend money on its social games.Rivals such as Kixeye have been monetising at much better rates than Zynga by making games that appeal to hard-core gamers. Zynga has focused on casual players to date, but it described its acquisition as a “mid-core” (whatever that means!), “multi-platform games developer”. No financial details were released, but Zynga described the deal as “small”.San Mateo-based A Bit Lucky is known for its Lucky Space and Lucky Train games. Lucky Space is a space colonisation game with more sophisticated elements – such as an actual plot – than the usual farm or city building games from Zynga.Zynga said the developer was also working on Solstice Arena, “an awesome multi-player (and multi-platform) game”.“The news underscores Zynga’s continued efforts to expand into new game categories and reach new audiences,” it said.A Bit Lucky’s 20 or so employees will move to Zynga’s San Francisco headquarters and Zynga also tried to underscore it was getting some hot gaming talent with the deal – it has suffered a lot of bad press lately for some high-profile departures.A Bit Lucky is led by Frederic Descamps, formerly of Trion Worlds and Xfire, and Jordan Maynard, also from Trion Worlds and, prior to that, Electronic Arts.Zynga said it had also recently hired John Tobias, co-creator of the hard-core Mortal Kombat series.Zynga shares closed 3 per cent lower at $3.08 on Monday and have lost more than two-thirds of their value since their December IPO.
56;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-08-30T23:53:43Z;Zynga loses two more executives;;Two more executives have left Zynga, the leading social gaming company whose stock has lost 70 per cent of its value since going public in December.There has been a string of departures this month after the San Francisco-based company issued disappointing quarterly results and its stock price continued to slide. The latest to leave are vice presidents Bill Mooney and Brian Birtwistle.Mr Mooney was an early employee, joining in 2008 when Zynga was a year old and later becoming manager of its Wars games, including Mafia Wars. Brian Birtwistle joined in 2011 and was a marketing vice president.Zynga announced the resignation of John Schappert, chief operating officer, three weeks ago, its rival Kixeye said it had hired Alan Patmore, general manager of CityVille, a week ago, while earlier this week, Mike Verdu, chief creative officer, left to start his own company.“Zynga’s voluntary attrition rate was around 1 per cent for the first four years, and our current attrition levels are not only below what we expected and modelled in our post-IPO planning, they continue to stay well below the industry average,” said Dani Dudeck, Zynga spokesperson, in an emailed response on Thursday.“Developing great leaders is an essential part of Zynga’s core values – we’re proud of our record in that regard – and it’s not at all surprising that some would move on and/or retire post-IPO.”Zynga’s shares closed 2.3 per cent lower at $2.89 on Thursday. They floated at $10 a share in its December IPO.Zynga has seen revenues weakening on the Facebook social network, where it is the dominant social gaming company with titles such as The Ville, CityVille, FarmVille and Bubble Safari.Bloomberg first reported the new departures. In a media lunch at the news agency’s San Francisco office on Wednesday, Frank Gibeau, president of labels at Electronic Arts, suggested Zynga should not have focused so much on Facebook.“We’re a multi-platform company, not a single-platform company and so, from our perspective, it’s important that you not go too hard in one direction, otherwise you might not be future-proofed,” he said.Mr Gibeau said EA felt justified in suing Zynga this month for alleged copying of its The Sims Social Facebook game with The Ville.“We’ve never really run into anything this egregious before, we don’t sue a lot of people, there’s one actor who has a track record of doing this [cloning] and they stepped on the wrong toes,” he said.
57;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-08-26T15:58:04Z;US video game sector in ‘freemium’ challenge;;The US video game industry’s traditional business models of selling disc-based games and charging online subscriptions is under threat from free-to-play titles, according to Asian rivals pushing the “freemium” model in America.Korean publisher NCsoft on Tuesday launches Guild Wars 2, a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game that does not require the monthly subscriptions favoured by Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts, the publishers of the World of Warcraft and Star Wars MMOs respectively.Tokyo-based Nexon became NCsoft’s largest shareholder in June when it bought a 15 per cent stake in the company. Nexon claims to have invented 11 years ago the “freemium” business model of making games free to play and then charging players for additional virtual items.“Today we believe this is the future of the industry and that there will ultimately be limited if any other business models besides that,” Owen Mahoney, a former EA executive who is Nexon’s chief financial officer, said in a Financial Times interview.“The science of getting people to buy a $60, 60-hour game experience on a DVD in a box is a very hard thing to do. In our view, it’s a broken or really challenged business model.”Nexon’s experience in Korea – its original base – and Japan has been that physical goods have disappeared as broadband speeds have increased dramatically – allowing rapid digital downloads of games as well as rich online gameplay.It sees the same thing happening in the US and Europe – territories it considers “emerging markets” – as speeds increase.That could take some time, however. Currently half of its revenues come from China, with North America contributing only about 7 per cent, or $80m in its last fiscal year, generated from online PC games such as Maple Story.NCsoft’s Guild Wars 2 will cost $60 for an initial digital download of the game, but promises years of unrestricted online play without the need to pay further fees. Its predecessor, released in 2005, sold more than 7m copies.“We see in the industry a real hunger from players to try something new and different and that’s what we’re trying to deliver for them, so I think we will see a lot of interest from existing MMO players in Guild Wars 2,” said Mike O’Brien, president of its developer ArenaNet, in a FT interview.Activision Blizzard announced this month that global World of Warcraft subscribers fell sharply to 9.1m from 10.2m during its past quarter.EA cut the price of its Star Wars: The Old Republic game to $15 from $60 three weeks ago and will introduce a free-to-play option from November after it saw total subscriber numbers dip below 1m in its past quarter.
58;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-08-16T18:50:29Z;Electronic Arts – game on?;A buyout might prove a winner amid talk of private equity;"Video gaming looks, at first blush, like a very odd target for private equity. It is a hit-driven business, so it doesn’t usually generate the stable cash flows that makes leveraged buyouts work. And the industry is undergoing structural change. The fabulously profitable console gaming model, in which customers buy a disc to slap into that box in front of the couch, is in decline: between 2008 and 2011 console software sales dropped 15 per cent in the US, according to NPD.The fast-growing part of the business – games delivered over the internet, often sold to casual rather than hardcore gamers, and frequently played within social networks or on mobile devices – is exciting but hard to predict. Consider how social game maker Zynga’s growth has come to a sudden and unexpected stop.All the same, rumour has it that private equity is looking at Electronic Arts; the speculation gave its shares a jolt on Thursday. And on closer consideration, a buyout could make sense, and not just because EA’s shares, having lost almost half their value since last autumn, are looking cheap.Packaged game software still makes a lot of money. US sales last year were $7.5bn and a hardware upgrade cycle – which will spur sales – is looming. Microsoft and Sony are expected to release new consoles in time for Christmas 2013. And because it has renewable game franchises, revenues at EA have been admirably stable at about $4bn in each of the past three years. Yes, free cash flow is lumpy, but it has been negative in just one of the past 12 quarters.Finally, the third of EA’s revenue that does not come from packaged software is growing at 50 per cent (acquisitions have helped). Impossible to predict if that can keep up, but if it should, the company would get a super-premium valuation upon resale. Game on?Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
59;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-08-03T20:57:17Z;EA sues Zynga over social ‘cloning’;;"Electronic Arts has filed suit against Zynga for allegedly copying its game The Sims Social, in a case that highlights their bitter rivalry and the practice of “cloning” in social gaming.Zynga released The Ville in June and it has quickly become the most popular game on Facebook’s social network, with 40m monthly active users, according to AppData.com.But in a blog post on Friday, EA said it was filing a lawsuit because “Zynga’s design choices, animations, visual arrangements and character motions and directions have been directly lifted from The Sims Social “.Alleged copying of the game, which launched last August and currently has 16.5m monthly active users, “was so comprehensive that the two games are, to an uninitiated observer, largely indistinguishable”, said Lucy Bradshaw, general manager of EA’s Maxis label, which developed The Sims franchise.The practice of “cloning” the successful ideas of other game developers has been common practice in social gaming but has generally not led to legal action.“Some will say The Ville simply iterates; some will tell us to get over it and move on,” admits Ms Bradshaw.The two companies have sparred before. EA, once the biggest video game publisher, made barbed comments about Zynga as the young company poached its executives and overtook it in market capitalisation when it went public last year.The new complaint, filed in northern California’s district court, alleged Zynga had access to confidential information about the development of The Sims Social through hiring three of EA’s top executives: John Schappert, chief operating officer, and the heads of the company’s casual games and interactive divisions.The Sims allows players to build their own characters and communities and EA alleges six of the nine personality types in The Sims Social are copied by The Ville and given a different name. So instead of athlete, creative, romantic, socialite, tycoon and villain, The Ville has jock, artist, charmer, partier, mogul and scoundrel.Reggie Davis, Zynga general counsel, responded in a statement that The Ville built on Zynga innovations and introduced a number of new social features.“It’s also ironic that EA brings this suit shortly after launching SimCity Social, which bears an uncanny resemblance to Zynga’s CityVille game,” he said.Zynga is believed to have settled out of court a 2009 case where the developer of the Mob Wars gangster social game alleged Zynga’s Mafia Wars was a close copy.In 2010, Disney settled a case in which Zynga alleged its games were being “cloned” by Playdom, which had been bought by Disney. Zynga alleged Playdom induced former Zynga employees to reveal trade secrets, including the contents of its “playbook” containing the ingredients for creating a successful social game."
60;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Diablo sequel a blessing for Activision;;Activision Blizzard has announced profits well ahead of Wall Street expectations, with sales boosted by the success of its Diablo III online role-playing PC game.The leading video game publisher by revenues reported second-quarter profits of 20 cents a share compared to an analyst consensus of 12 cents. Sales of $1.05bn beat Wall Street forecasts of $832m.Activision’s Blizzard division released Diablo III on May 15 and the company said it had attracted 10m players by the end of July.“It did really well and it could be the bestselling PC game of all time,” Bobby Kotick, chief executive, told the FT.However, Blizzard’s more established online game, World of Warcraft, suffered a drop of just over 10 per cent in subscribers– to 9.1m from 10.2m in the first quarter – suggesting some degree of cannibalisation from the Diablo game.On Tuesday, Activision’s rival Electronic Arts reported subscribers to its Star Wars: The Old Republic online game fell below 1m in the last quarter and that it would change its business model to offer a free-to-play version.Activision expects World of Warcraft to be boosted by new content in a September software release called Mists of Pandaria.The Santa Monica, California-based company said it had the top three bestselling games in North America and Europe in the first six months of the year, with Skylanders Spyro’s Adventures, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Diablo III.It is optimistic about the prospects for the sequels Skylanders Giants and Call of Duty: Black Ops II in the second half and it raised its guidance for the year above analysts forecasts.It predicted profits of 99 cents per share on revenues of $4.63bn, ahead of Wall Street’s 98 cents on $4.59bn.“While we are increasing our financial outlook for full year 2012, we remain cautious given economic uncertainty, risks to consumer spending especially during the holiday season and the recognition that the majority of our key franchise launches are still ahead of us,” said Mr Kotick in a statement.Activision Blizzard shares closed 0.5 per cent lower ahead of the earnings report, then fell 2.7 per cent afterward to $11.45.
61;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-07-31T23:28:00Z;Force not with EA on Star Wars;;Electronic Arts says subscriptions for its Star Wars: The Old Republic game have slipped below 1m, forcing it to “pivot” to a free-to-play option for the much vaunted franchise.Launched in December, Star Wars was supposed to try to supplant Activision’s World of Warcraft (WoW) online role-playing game, but its subscribers now amount to less than 10 per cent of the 10.2m users paying for that world-leading title.Ray Muzyka, co-founder of BioWare, the EA studio that makes the Star Wars game, told us before its launch that it had the potential to be even bigger than WoW, given the power of the brand.“We know from market research that a lot of MMO [massively multiplayer online] players are actively looking for the next big thing and they actually consider Star Wars to be that, either from personal experience of going through the beta or knowing someone who is in it,” he said then.EA sold 2.4m copies to the end of March of the PC software needed to install the game, but subscribers declined from 1.7m to 1.3m in the first three months of the year, with the Silicon Valley company saying a substantial number of dropouts were casual users ending trial subscriptions.Frank Gibeau, EA Labels president, told an analyst first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday that the message from players, who had continued to abandon the game, was clear: “Forty per cent said they were turned off by the monthly subscription. Many indicate that they would come back if we offered a free-to-play model.”Thus EA will offer a two-tier model from November. A $15-a-month premium membership will continue for comprehensive access to the game and monthly infusions of in-game currency to spend on virtual goods, plus there will be an option where the first 50 levels of the game can be played for free, with some restrictions on content and advanced features.“If and when they are ready, [free-to-play gamers] can easily switch to the premium tier,” he said.EA’s move begs the question of why it did not offer this in the first place – the “freemium” model of free-to-play with the option to upgrade for more features is well established in online games.The publisher will also reduce the price of the Star Wars software in North America from $60 to $15 from August 6, with a similar reduction in Europe.“The pivot to free-to-play is really about opening up the top of the funnel and getting more players through and starting to claw back some of the folks that have churned,” said Mr Gibeau.EA said the disappointing performance of Star Wars was largely offset by the success of Battlefield 3 Premium, a service that offers extra content for the shooter game for $50 a year. EA has seen 1.3m downloads in the two months since it launched.
62;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-07-31T17:07:58Z;Zynga loses Wall Street friends;;Zynga with Friends is the social gaming company’s latest networking innovation to connect its players ever more closely, but Zynga without Friends better represents the current state of play on Wall Street. The San Francisco company has done nothing but alienate the financial community over the past few days.On Monday, Newman Ferrara was the first law firm to file what are expected to be a series of class-action lawsuits on behalf of investors, alleging Zynga’s executives “knowingly or recklessly” made misleading statements this year about the company’s performance and prospects.That followed Zynga’s radical downward revision of its outlook on an earnings call last week, which led to a 38 per cent fall in its share price on Thursday.Zynga said its forecast reflected “a faster decline in existing web games due in part to a more challenging environment on the Facebook web platform” – a comment that has sparked debate over whether it is just Zynga that is in decline or the entire casual gaming genre of building farms and cities, and playing word games, that has thus far dominated on Facebook.Gaming on social networking sites such as Facebook was considered a promising new market for both traditional games publishers like Electronic Arts and new entrants like Zynga. But there have been recent signs that casual gaming, on Facebook at least, is losing steam.While roughly half of Facebook’s active users were gamers at the end of 2010, that proportion fell to a quarter at end of 2011, and the absolute number of gamers on Facebook changed little, according to IHS, the research consultancy.Analysts say Zynga’s woes are outsized compared to those of the broader market for casual games, because of its dependence on Facebook, where it makes most of its sales.“Zynga probably overestimated how evergreen its games are – CityVille and FarmVille revenues were very stable for several quarters, but they started to tail off,” says Michael Pachter, games analyst at Wedbush Securities, who reduced his share-price target from $17 to $7 on Thursday.He says this appeared to happen before the launch in June of Facebook’s App Center, a store for apps such as games, video and music services that work mainly within Facebook.Zynga, which declined to comment on the class-action lawsuit, claims the App Center was favouring new games in its promotions and recommendations, but some of its rivals dispute this.Will Harbin, chief executive of game-maker Kixeye, says there is still room for games companies to attract gamers and make money on Facebook. Mr Harbin, whose Battle Pirates and War Commander titles are among the top grossing on Facebook, despite having only a fraction of the players of CityVille or CastleVille, says Kixeye has seen a 48 per cent increase in new users for its games since the App Center was launched.While less than 3 per cent of Zynga’s players spend money on virtual goods in its games, Kixeye claims a far higher percentage of its players spend money, because its games attract more hardcore, and predominantly male, gamers.Zynga said last week that it too would begin to target this audience.“Good luck to them, bring it on. . . They cannot make a quality game in the way we can,” says Mr Harbin.AJ Glasser, managing editor of Inside Network, which provides analysis of the Facebook platform, says Zynga is suffering from stagnation among its more casual gamers.“I think they have just found their game and they are staying with it. The switching cost of going to a new one means you lose a lot of the time you invested in the game, so why bother?” she says.Zynga is trying to become less dependent on Facebook, with its own gaming platform at Zynga.com, but analysts feel there is a bigger threat to its continuing success.“Reduced engagement is due to a shift from PC-based social gaming to mobile gaming,” say analysts at Cowen and Company.“We think this shift is likely permanent and ongoing, threatening Zynga's largest business segment.”Analysts at Macquarie say Zynga’s efforts in mobile gaming to date looked little different from “myriad other casual game companies” and it lacked the first-mover advantage it had on Facebook.Wooga, a German rival, unveiled its mobile strategy last week. Half of its more than 200 employees are now working on mobile, a big shift from being a Facebook-only company a year ago.“Mobile is the next big opportunity for growth,” says Jens Begemann, founder and chief executive.“We believe the big shift that’s happening is mobile games that have been single-player are now becoming social.”Zynga also held out hope last week for significant revenues from real-money gaming, with versions of its poker, bingo and slot machine games under development for release in the first half of next year.It will have to focus on international markets, though, with such gambling illegal in the US, and analysts think that here, too, betting on Zynga’s success represents something of a roll of the dice.
63;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-07-25T10:59:47Z;E3 provides lift for video game industry;;The video game industry looked to the razzle-dazzle of its annual trade show in Los Angeles this week to lift it out of depression – and E3, in part, delivered.Sales have been suffering as interest has waned in the current generation of consoles, now seven years old, but Nintendo showed more than 20 games that would feature on its Wii U unit, due out later this year.“We need new consoles to come quickly and the Wii U is welcome this year to change the trend,” says Yves Guillemot, chief executive of the French video game publisher Ubisoft.Sales of console hardware and software are down 31 per cent in the US so far this year and the stocks of its publishers have slumped. Forward earnings multiples are more than 50 per cent below the level of five years ago.“The entire sector is sold off at a level that I don’t think is rational,” says John Riccitiello, Electronic Arts chief executive.He says investors are not taking into account growing digital and online sales, as well as the likelihood of new consoles from Sony and Microsoft next year.“We believe, based on what we know is coming, that it gets better from here,” he added.E3 also demonstrated the growing competition consoles face from tablets, smartphones and even resurgent PCs, with big presences from Gree of Japan, WeMade of Korea and Belarus’s Wargaming.net, showing the threat from the more mature multiplayer online and smartphone gaming markets of the east.
64;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Technologist, transform thyself;;Over the past two decades, many industries have been transformed by new digital technologies.Retail giants like Barnes & Noble and Borders have had to contend with e-books, e-readers, and new retail channels such as Amazon and Apple’s iTunes. Media giants such as MGM and Warner have struggled to move their legacy media businesses into the world of digital media creation and distribution. Video game leaders like Activision and Electronic Arts are shifting from PC and console boxed games and moving to agile development tools and technologies that require their engineers to essentially learn entirely new ways of working.Even in industries where products are not obvious candidates for digitisation, we have seen dramatic digitally driven transformations. For example, retail financial institutions have been shifting from branches to online banking. General merchandise and apparel retailers are struggling to fully digitise their supply chains to compete with nimble and flexible competitors, and automakers are embracing new drivetrain and in-vehicle digital technologies. Apple is even eyeing automakers, hoping to integrate its Siri voice technology into their vehicles.Technology leaders such as Apple, Cisco, HP, IBM, and Microsoft have primarily acted as enablers and guides by bringing to market the technologies, solutions and services needed to power digitisation in other industries. In so doing, they have reaped profound benefits.Cisco became a global industry leader by shipping the boxes that built a worldwide Internet backbone. HP satisfied the enormous demands of government, enterprise, and small-business customers as they equipped their employee bases with connected workstations, devices, and enterprise infrastructure. And Apple became the most valuable company in the world as customers considering all types of products voted with their wallets to embrace digitised ways of reading, listening, watching, and working, powered by all forms of iDevices.The biggest challenge for these tech companies has been a great problem to have - how do we get big enough and fast enough to satisfy skyrocketing demand? But now the times are changing.These leading technology companies are facing the unsettling reality that the digital advances they have unleashed on the world are coming home to roost. These tools are attacking, disrupting, and undermining the very technology businesses and capabilities systems that were created and rapidly grown during the internet revolution. Ironically, these once subversive and disruptive tech companies have now matured into established businesses plagued by the same challenges as those whose transformations they helped drive not so long ago.These companies are suffering because their legacy capabilities systems don’t meet the needs of the new world - and aren’t being transformed fast enough to keep up. Cisco has announced a 9 per cent reduction in employees whose skills are no longer the right ones. HP is making 27,000 job cuts as it seeks to free up resources to reinvest in cloud, connectivity, and big data. Microsoft is moving all its offerings to the cloud and is refocusing, upgrading, and retraining thousands of talented-but-legacy skilled computer engineers and developers.They have no small task ahead - simultaneously transforming their large legacy systems while building the cutting-edge capabilities systems they need to fuel the future. For guidance, they should turn to the industries their digital technologies transformed in the last decade. As we looked at dozens of these companies, three key insights emerged:Be ruthlessly focused. Identify the few key things your company does better than any other and let these differentiating capabilities drive your strategy. Trying to be all things to all customers is not a strategy, just an unsustainable hedge bet. Sure, it’s more comfortable to hedge during times of transition, but all that guarantees is a seat in the back of the bus.Run lean and outsource smartly. Optimise costs, developing lean and deliberate practices that see you focus your spending and resources on your strategic priorities. In IT this means looking at every legacy system and deciding which elements you need to own and which are no longer critical. Once you are ruthlessly focused on your capabilities, deciding what to hold close and what to outsource will be easy. Look at the success this brought Apple and Google when they enabled third-party developer ecosystems to build products for their platforms.Cut to grow. Austerity will take you only so far. Reinvest some of the money you’ve saved by running lean and use it to fund your growth bets. Channeling your investments into your key capabilities and the talent that drives them will move your focused, lean, and smart strategy forward.Global technology industry leaders have become giants fueled by the digital technologies that they unleashed on other people’s businesses. Those technologies are now undermining the very parents that bred and raised them. That’s a problem - but also an opportunity. The technology companies that learn how to successfully manage the same transformations they thrust upon other industries will be the ones that are “fit for growth” in the digitally enabled technology industry of the future.Matthew Le Merle is a partner at Booz & Company and an expert in large-scale transformations and turnarounds, including those made necessary by the digitisation phenomenon

Electronic Arts, the US video games publisher, agreed this week to race the Russian sports car in its popular Need for Speed multiplayer online action game.Marussia Motors was founded in 2007 by Russian actor cum racing driver Nikolai
Fomenko who is on a mission to tune up the Russian auto industry with a new generation of high technology super cars.The original B2 prototype was developed at Marussia’s Moscow plant but assembly
operations have now moved to Finland where the company entered a strategic partnership with Valmet Automotive, the contract specialty auto maker, early this year. Valmet is providing engineering and manufacturing services at its Usikaupunki plant where the ﬁrst B2s will roll off a dedicated assembly line by early 2013.Russia is battling to develop a modern auto industry capable of producing even ordinary passenger cars capable of holding their own against competing foreign models. Marussia is the ﬁrst domestic auto maker to enter the luxury segment and produce a car that could be Russia’s answer to the Lamborghini or Bugatti.It’s a bold move even more so because the company claims the B2 will be fashioned
almost entirely out of Russian made parts.About 85 per cent of the parts for the B2, including the sports car’s carbon body, will be made in Russia says Mikhail Zharkov, Marussia spokesman. “It’s really a Russian car.”Marussia is promoting the B2 through a new showroom opened in Monte Carlo this year and is preparing to unveil a ﬂashy Moscow outlet in the Autumn. Prices start at €100,000. Already 500 orders have ﬂowed in – enough to keep the assembly line at Usikaupunki busy for more than a year.Zharkov declined to reveal the terms of Marussia’s deal with Electronic Arts that will see the B2 take to the virtual racing track late this year. With more than 16m users, Need for Speed is a cult video game and could help turn the B2 into a cult sports car. “The deal is interesting for them and interesting for us.”Real life motorists will have to wait a bit longer to see just how interesting Russia’s ﬁrst sports car really is. In the meantime, here’s another photo of the B2 race car enthusiasts can ogle over.Related reading:

66;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-06-10T22:51:37Z;E3 2012 reflects “fin de cycle” video gaming;;The video game industry looked to the razzle-dazzle of its annual trade show in Los Angeles this week to lift it out of depression and E3, in part, delivered.Sales have been suffering as interest has waned in the current generation of consoles, now seven years old, but Nintendo showed more than 20 games that would feature on its innovative Wii U console, due to launch later this year.“We need new consoles to come quickly and the Wii U is welcome this year to change the trend,” Yves Guillemot, chief executive of the French video game publisher Ubisoft, told me.Sales of console hardware and software are down 31 per cent in the US so far this year and the stocks of its publishers have slumped. Forward earnings multiples are more than 50 per cent below the level of five years ago.“The entire sector is sold off at a level that I don’t think is rational,” said John Riccitiello, Electronic Arts chief executive, who says investors are not taking into account growing digital and online sales, as well as the likelihood of new consoles from Sony and Microsoft next year.“We believe, based on what we know is coming that what was a headwind becomes a tailwind, it gets better from here,” he said.While Sony gave no news of any impending console, its Wonderbook peripheral was the only real hardware innovation from the console makers at the show and it won the approval of J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, who has written Book of Spells as its debut title.Microsoft showed off its Xbox SmartGlass technology for transferring content between tablets, smartphones and the TV and giving second-screen experiences.Marc Whitten, head of Xbox Live, told me content partners and game publishers were excited by the possibilities this would present when SmartGlass is introduced in the autumn.“Once you can start helping the consumer have a deeper and richer experience, they all see the magic that comes from that,” he says.E3 also demonstrated the growing competition consoles face from tablets, smartphones, resurgent PCs and cloud gaming.OnLive demonstrated its cloud gaming service on an LG Google TV, available soon, and announced an extension to its spectating feature, where gamers will be able to watch three other players’ sessions while continuing with their own.Gaikai announced a partnership with Machinima to serve videos of gaming action over its cloud service, while Samsung Cloud Gaming was a new Gaikai-powered service announced for the latest smart TVs in Samsung’s range.Gree of Japan took one of the biggest exhibition spaces in its first appearance at E3 and showed a range of smartphone games with social features.WeMade of Korea, best known for its Legend of Mir online role playing game, also had a big presence at E3, which it said was its first step “towards becoming the number-one game company in the world”. It plans to release 20 mobile, social and online games this year and unveiled eight at E3 covering various genres.Gamers also crowded into Belarus-based Wargaming.net’s booth to play online games such as its forthcoming World of Warplanes, showing the threat to US companies is coming from the East where multiplayer online and smartphone gaming markets seem more mature.
67;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Console makers adapt to gamers’ new habits;;At the annual E3 video game show this week, console makers’ main focus will not be on the latest games, but rather other forms of entertainment like music and movies that they hope will extend the life and functionality of their now-ageing boxes.Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and Sony’s PlayStation 3 are now nearly seven years old, and both companies are looking to offer music, movies and even live television through them, in addition to games, to reignite consumers’ interest.Microsoft is also matching Nintendo’s Wii U, the successor to the Wii due later this year, with a new feature that allows movies, photos and other media to be transferred on to a TV, via the Xbox, from a tablet or laptop running Windows 8.The move comes as consoles and the video game publishers that supply them with disk-based games – a traditional area of strength for consoles – risk being left behind by new platforms and changes in gamers habits. Consoles’ technical capabilities are also being overtaken by improvements in graphics in other devices, like tablets and PCs.Game disk sales are down 31 per cent this year so far in the US – a fourth consecutive year of falls despite the number of consoles in households continuing to grow.Michael Pachter, video game analyst at Wedbush Securities, says publishers have released fewer titles and relied too much on sequels as they anticipate the end of the current console cycle.“They have been reluctant to greenlight any new [intellectual property] – in 2007, Electronic Arts made 49 games, in 2012, they are making 19,” he says.“As far as casual gaming on consoles goes, clearly social gaming has taken away the Wii effect. The 85 year-old grandma or the 45-year-old housewife, who were playing Wii tennis or Wii Fit, are now playing FarmVille, [a popular Facebook game].”The PC is also coming into its own again as a platform for social casual gaming, online multiplayer games and downloading digital content.“The gaming audience is moving to the PC somewhat out of desire and somewhat out of necessity, which is what tends to happen when the console cycle is winding down,” says John Davison, head of programming at the Gamespot gamers’ website.He says young gamers are using hand-me-down laptops to play sophisticated online games. The Steam download service for PC games has become very popular, as are new titles such as Activision Blizzard’s Diablo III, which sold 3.5m copies in its first 24 hours last month – a record for a PC game.Console gamers are also purchasing fewer disk-based games as they prefer extensions to blockbuster games that are available to buy and download.“They are sticking with fewer games for longer, buying downloadable content or subscriptions for them, so the big games are becoming platforms in themselves, keeping their audiences engaged by constantly feeding them new content,” says Mr Davison.Digital sales are not included in the monthly software figures for the industry, meaning the picture is brighter than it looks for publishers such as Activision, which sells map pack extensions for its Call of Duty game and subscriptions for World of Warcraft, and Electronic Arts, which has been exporting its major franchises to Facebook and mobile gaming apps.Mobile phones, tablets and smart TVs now have multi-core processors that can almost match the capabilities of consoles. In another shift, the chipmaker Nvidia last month unveiled graphics processors (GPU) for data centres that would deliver rich “cloud” gaming to even the simplest of devices.“I think the announcement from Nvidia of more formalised cloud GPU support is going to lead to more cloud gaming products coming out, it’s a logical progression,” says Brian Blau, video game analyst at the Gartner research firm.Michael Pachter at Wedbush Securities says Microsoft is positioning itself to offer the next Xbox as an all-round entertainment appliance, sold at a subsidised price with a monthly subscription – similar to how cable or satellite TV boxes are now being offered. He points to a new experiment where the Xbox 360 is being offered for $99 with a $15 a month Xbox Live subscription for two years.“The next console could be a $100 box where you sign up for five years,” he says.E3 attendees may listen in vain for news of Microsoft and Sony’s next console offerings, expected in 2013, although Nintendo is expected to set a fourth-quarter 2012 launch date for the Wii U. One thing is certain: the forthcoming, eighth console generation will compete for gamers’ time with many more alternatives than its predecessors.
68;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-05-21T18:48:36Z;Games tax relief lures back Activision;;Activision Blizzard, the US-based games company behind titles such as Call of Duty and Guitar Hero, is planning to set up a new studio in the UK, the first large publisher to increase investment after new tax relief rules announced by the government.Activision is understood to be recruiting staff for a studio located in the north of England which will focus on making mobile games. Martyn Brown, a UK industry veteran, has been appointed to hire developers for the venture.“We are investing in mobile initiatives and that includes a UK studio,” Activision said. It did not reveal the size of the investment.Tiga, the games industry body, said the Activision move indicated that the government’s decision to offer games makers film-style tax relief on production costs was helping to bring companies back to the UK.“This is a massive vote of confidence in the UK games industry and demonstrates that Tiga’s successful campaign for games tax relief is already bearing fruit,” said Richard Wilson, the organisation’s chief executive.Activision dramatically scaled back its presence in the UK in 2011 when it closed down its Bizarre Creations studio in Liverpool, affecting 200 jobs. That closure came just six months after the incoming coalition government had blocked a Labour plan for tax relief.Since 2006, the UK has gone from being the world’s third-largest games maker to sixth place in 2011, losing out to countries such as Canada that attract developers with tax breaks. The UK now accounts for just 3.5 per cent of global investment in the sector, down from 10 per cent in 2000.Other games publishers have so far been more hesitant about reinvesting in the UK. Electronic Arts, which also closed a UK studio last year, has said that the tax relief appears less favourable for games companies than similar relief for film, television and animation.
69;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-05-20T19:15:59Z;From banking to gaming, the changing face of MBA jobs;Technology and games companies are increasingly valuing the range of skills offered by business school graduates;"Those who think an MBA is just about a job in banking or consultancy, think again. Two of the most high profile recruiters for MBAs at the top US schools this year are rival games companies Electronic Arts, creators of the Sims characters, and Zynga, which runs the Farmville game on Facebook.For EA, the need for top MBA graduates is fuelled by the company’s changing role from a packaged goods company to a digital company, says Jessica Rawson, who is in charge of university relations. “What is driving us is what our customers are doing”.So the focus now is on graduates who are skilled in analytics. “It’s being able to take the numbers and create a story and communicate that story,” says Ms Rawson.The games companies are not alone in valuing the combination of analytics and communications, says Julie Morton, associate dean for career services at Chicago Booth, and one of the schools where EA actively recruits. “I think of it as critical thinking rather than numbers per se,” she adds.So as jobs on Wall Street wane, the most numerate MBA graduates are finding a welcome home in companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Yahoo, companies for which data analytics are critical to the business. Such is the case at Wall Street specialist Columbia Business School in New York, says Gina Resnick, associate dean and managing director of Columbia’s career management centre. “What’s been very exciting has been the changing opportunities and the technology renaissance in New York city.”Chinese MBA graduates are proving increasingly valuable to the world’s multinationals, all eager to establish their businesses in the booming Asian economy.No more so than at Microsoft, the US software giant, which this year is recruiting between 30 and 35 MBA graduates worldwide to work in its China operations. To begin with, those selected will be inculcated in the Microsoft culture and will spend 18 months in the company in three locations, including the US and Europe.Microsoft has a strong internship and campus recruitment programme, says Malcolm Bentley, Microsoft regional staffing director in Beijing. Its MBA hire programme is now in its third year. “This is an issue being driven by KT [Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft] to enhance future leadership in Microsoft,” adds Mr Bentley.MBA recruits are selected from a dozen or so top business schools, where, Mr Bentley says, the company has been successful in selecting the right people. These include Peking University and Tsinghua in Beijing, Ceibs and Fudan in Shanghai and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, along with a selection of the more usual suspects: Chicago Booth, Duke, Insead, Kellogg, London Business School and Michigan Ross.The students are hired for a range of jobs, including technical roles and corporate strategy positions. Not all successful candidates will need to speak Mandarin, but it will always help to learn, says Mr Bentley. “To be honest, to be able to manoeuvre in the more remote parts of China it is essential,” he adds.All of which means there is a lot of work that goes into selecting the best candidates. “You’ve got to treat these candidates like a top-end executive hire,” says Mr Bentley. “We don’t just hire a bunch of MBAs.”Though the final statistics for 2012 have not yet been compiled, MBA recruitment in the US appears to be closely tracking that of 2011. According to a survey of global recruiters to be published by the Graduate Management Admissions Council this week, not only are more companies planning to hire recent MBAs this year - up from 72 per cent in 2011 to 79 per cent this year - but they expect to increase the number of new hires from 13 in 2011 to 17 in 2012.“It (recruitment) is certainly not down, not at all,” says Regina Regazzi, executive director for corporate relations with UCLA Anderson. “It is certainly better than a few years ago.” At Harvard, where MBA students graduate this week, Jana Kierstead, executive director of the MBA programme, is more positive still. “Optimism is in the air. Students are really willing to wait (for the right job) and are determined to pursue their vision.”Salaries have also rebounded. At Harvard, the bellwether for MBA salaries, the median salary for the Class of 2012 is expected to be $125,000, up from $120,000 in 2012.But in Europe, the Euro crisis and economic austerity has resulted in recruiter caution, says Fiona Sandford, director for career services at London Business School. “When confidence wobbles, recruiters become more conservative.” In London as in New York, the “bulge banks” have reduced the number of MBAs they hire this year, but asset management firms continue to recruit, says Ms Sandford.Those students who are finding it hardest to find jobs are those who want to change sectors, she says.A decade ago a third of all graduates from top schools went into finance – largely investment banking – and another third went into consultancy, but these days up to 50 per cent of graduates are finding their first job in other sectors – in consumer goods, pharmaceutical, media, technology and industrial companies, as well as NGOs and charities. Social media strategists are also in demand across all sectors, says Kevin Frey, who runs the full-time MBA programme at the Rotman school in Toronto.And the way companies recruit is changing too. Games company EA is typical in that it is taking several routes to hiring students: as well as on-campus recruiting, it is posting job adverts for specific roles. Ms Rawson points out that with the market changing rapidly, many of the just-in-time hires are for brand new jobs.Graduates from NYU Stern, most noted as a finance school, also do well in luxury goods and the media industry. Christian Dior, Estée Lauder and Tiffany have all recruited there this year, along with Disney, LinkedIn and Quidsi, the retailing division of Amazon.Rocket Internet, the web marketing company, is one of the newest recruiters at NUS Business School in Singapore, along with eBay,
PayPal and LVMH. Impact Investment Shujog, the social enterprise investment company, also recruits there.In Spain, new recruiters at Iese Business School this year include retailers Uniqlo, Mango and Marks & Spencer, along with car company Audi.Meanwhile in California, Zynga, the hottest name in online games, was a recruiter at the Haas school at UC Berkeley this year, along with the UK’s BT and Autodesk, the computer-aided design software company.Novozymes, the Danish biotech company, uses campus recruiting, job postings and its own case competition to select MBAs for its China operations, recruiting at Ceibs in Shanghai.And proving that luxury is not just a US and European obsession, Louis Vuitton hires at Melbourne Business School in Australia, as do the more traditional banks and consultancies, including Australian banks ANZ and NAB.Increasingly company hiring patterns reflect the company culture, says Ms Morton, citing the example of Zynga, where representatives from the school interview via videoconferencing. “They (students) sat around the screen and chatted. A lot of students are very comfortable to do interviews via Skype or videoconferencing. That’s very much the norm now.”…Students are behaving differently too. Even at Harvard, the master at on-campus recruiting, almost 50 per cent of students now find a job via a different route. And they are looking to small companies for emplyment. “We’re seeing students looking at more customised, smaller shops, so they can see their impact early on,” according to Ms KiersteadAs well as analytical skills, languages, too, are proving valuable, reports Mr Frey, especially Mandarin and Spanish. “These language skills are really helping our students to get to the top of the interview pile.” Multiple languages and a real sense of working in different cultures are also valuable in China in both local and multinational companies, reports Yvonne Li, MBA director at Ceibs in Shanghai.Meanwhile a growing number of students are finding jobs in countries other than that in which they study. Harvard reports, for example, that a growing number of its US graduates are taking jobs outside the US.As for EA, which has studios in the UK and China as well as North America, it is now looking to recruit in Europe and Asia. The company has one obvious attraction, says Ms Rawson. “People have grown up playing these games …It’s a really cool way to come into analytics.”"
70;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-05-15T23:10:16Z;Children’s publishers join forces online;;Publishers including Hachette, Penguin and Simon & Schuster are putting their children’s books into a single online entertainment brand as they search for ways to profit from ebooks.The Magic Town platform is to be launched on Wednesday by Mindshapes, which was set up by two of the co-founders of Playfish, the UK online games company sold to Electronic Arts in 2009.The aim is to create a hub where children aged from two to six can find interactive ebooks, from classic fairy tales to stories featuring popular characters such as Elmer the Elephant. Magic Town, which will be available online immediately and on Apple’s iPad from next month, will operate on a “freemium” model. About 20 titles will be available to read for free. The full catalogue will cost £7.99 for a monthly or £49.99 for an annual subscription fee.“We are looking to become the primary entertainment brand for young children within the next few years,” said Christian Dorffer, chief commercial officer of Mindshapes. About 200 stories will be made available on the platform in the first year.Sarah Pakenham, rights director at Andersen Press, home of the Elmer books, said the publisher was interested in joining Magic Town because the cost of producing its own animated books for many platforms was too high for a small company.“We are creating our own ebooks, but they are very plain vanilla, with no narration or animation. The cost of adding those things on is very high. We don’t have the expertise to do it all or to foretell which part of the market to invest in,” she said.The platform is being introduced at a time when ebook sales are a growing proportion of the overall market. The Association of American Publishers said ebooks’ share of the children’s and young adult book market hit 16 per cent in February. According to estimates from PwC, ebook sales in Europe will grow 113 per cent this year but will still end the year as less than 2 per cent of the market.Online games and social networking sites for children, such as Moshi Monsters and Club Penguin, have proved popular. Magic Town is targeting an age group that is younger than the typical users for these sites and will focus more on reading and literacy.Magic Town has signed up three of the big six publishing companies, Simon & Schuster, Hachette and Penguin, owned by Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times. It is in talks with Macmillan and Bloomsbury.The publishers will be paid royalties based on how many times their books are read online. Mr Dorffer said the fees would initially be modest, “not hundreds of thousands of pounds”.Ms Pakenham said that while the royalties from the site were important for Andersen Press, she was also interested in the ability to promote the company’s less well-known titles. Mr Dorffer said publishers could further benefit from rapid feedback on titles.
71;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-05-09T23:47:39Z;Activision Blizzard subscribers fall;;Activision Blizzard’s first quarter sales fell 22 per cent and profits more than halved year-on-year as subscribers to its World of Warcraft online game declined and it spent more on new games.The world’s largest video game publisher by market capitalisation reported World of Warcraft subscriber numbers, after losses last summer, had steadied quarter-on-quarter to stay at 10.2m. Electronic Arts reported on Monday that the rival game it launched in December – Star Wars: The Old Republic – had seen subscribers fall from 1.7m to 1.3m.Bobby Kotick, Activision chief executive, told an analyst conference call that the company continued to build “a portfolio of mega-franchises”, with at least four making significant contributions to profitability in 2012.Beyond 2012, new games from Blizzard, Bungie – the developer of the Halo franchise – and an expansion of Activision’s Call of Duty franchise to China gave it “the strongest pipeline of new potential mega-franchises in our history”, he said.Mr Kotick said Black Ops II, the latest update to the company’s biggest franchise, Call of Duty, had the potential to be the biggest entertainment event of the year with its launch in November. Preorders were tracking ahead of the record-breaking current game, Modern Warfare III.Activision reported first-quarter sales of $587m, down from $755m a year earlier, but ahead of analyst expectations of $552m. Earnings of 6 cents a share compared to 13 cents a year ago and the 4 cents expected by Wall Street.
72;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;US retailers hurt by European concerns;;Fears of a slowdown in European spending on American products struck US retailers, with shares in watchmaker Fossil plummeting nearly 40 per cent.Overall, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index declined 1.3 per cent and was the worst performing sector group on the benchmark US index.The S&P 500 lost as much as 1.5 per cent, but made strong gains as the session drew to a close. The benchmark US index finished 0.4 per cent lower to 1,363.73 on Tuesday.International designer and retailer Fossil warned that its European business had begun to slump as the first quarter came to a close in March.The company blamed the slowdown for a reduction in its full-year earnings forecasts, which it said at best would be $5.33 a share, down from previous guidance of $5.50.Shares in Fossil plunged 37.6 per cent to $78.52, even as the company said net income rose 4.1 per cent in its first quarter to $58.1m, or earnings of 93 cents a share.Oliver Chen, analyst at Citigroup, said: “We believe negative news in Europe is impacting discretionary consumer spending as Fossil reduced organic European growth guidance to positive low to mid-single digits from positive mid-teens previously.”The sell-off in Fossil also sparked a drop in a range of other companies that may be facing a similar slowdown in their European business.Tiffany & Co, the luxury jewellery retailer, lost 1.5 per cent to $64.75. Coach, the leather goods retailers, dropped 1.8 per cent to $70.80, while Ralph Lauren, the fashion house known for its polo shirts, declined 3.2 per cent to $163.38.Abercrombie & Fitch, another US clothing retailer, was down 4.7 per cent to $46.69.Rebecca Patterson, chief market strategist at JPMorgan, said recent equity selling was driven by macro concerns about global growth and about Europe’s peripheral countries in particular.She said: “We have more room for market uncertainty, which likely means continued volatility.”She added: “Given that backdrop, we believe the best strategy today is to diversify sources of growth assets in portfolios. In equities, we are focused on large-cap growth and high-dividend strategies as well as emerging markets.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 12,932.09 and the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.4 per cent to 2,946.27.The tech stock-heavy index has dropped more than 4 per cent since the start of the second quarter in April.Shares in Discovery Communications, the global media company, fell 4.5 per cent to $47.16 as it reported first-quarter earnings of 57 cents a share – below analysts’ forecasts – on net income of $221m in the period.Benjamin Swinburne, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the company’s profits came in below expectations because of losses at the Oprah Winfrey Network, which is a cable channel half-owned by DiscoveryElectronic Arts, the US-based video game maker, declined 4.3 per cent to $14.48 as it forecast a first-quarter loss that was worse than expected.Shares in the company, which publishes the popular “FIFA” line of games, are down more than 31 per cent in the year to date and hit a 52-week low on Tuesday.Shares in Yahoo, the internet search and media company, rose 0.1 per cent to $15.36 as its chief executive Scott Thompson issued an apology for inaccuracies on his résumé that have come under criticism from shareholders.Mr Thompson wrote in a statement to employees: ”We have all been working very hard to move the company forward and this has had the opposite effect. For that, I take full responsibility and I want to apologise to you.”Shares in Apple, the world’s largest company by market valuation, lost 0.2 per cent to $568.18. Apple shares have now declined more than 10 per cent in the last month.Cognizant Technology Solutions, the outsourcing company, saw its shares pare some of its losses from Monday and added 7.1 per cent to $60.30.Shares in the company lost almost 20 per cent a day ago when it said demand for its services had cooled.Darrin Peller, analyst at Barclays, said: “Our discussions with investors suggest that market concerns exhibited in [Monday’s] stock price decline centre around a suspicion that Cognizant may be reaching a point of saturation at bigger clients, particularly top-tier banks, making it more sensitive to shifts in the demand environment that have impacted peers lately.”Disney shares rose 1.6 per cent in after-market trading as the entertainment company reported earnings beat analysts’ expectations for the second-quarter. Shares in Disney gained 1.1 per cent to $44.30 during the trading day.
73;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-05-08T00:54:34Z;EA slams Zynga, backs next-gen consoles;;Electronic Arts has criticised its social gaming rival Zynga for paying high prices for “instant one-hit wonders” that give it a “temporary lead” in the charts.John Riccitiello, chief executive, also used EA’s quarterly earnings call with analysts on Monday to argue the success of EA’s own digital and social strategy, defend falling subscriber numbers for its Star Wars online game and announce a big investment in next-generation console games. Details after the jump.EA has seen two senior executives defect to Zynga over the past year and has reacted testily to the young company overtaking it in market capitalisation since its IPO in December.EA is competing in social gaming and mobile helped by its own acquisitions of Playfish and Popcap Games, but, without actually naming Zynga, Mr Riccitiello made an obvious allusion to its acquisition of OMGPOP, developer of Draw Something, in March for a reported $200m.“I’m pretty anxious about acquiring instant one-hit wonders in this space – there’s an awful lot of noise that grows up around an individual franchise as it rises, less so when it declines,” he said.Draw Something, the Pictionary-style game, is showing signs of being a fad, with user numbers dropping by nearly a third in the past month.Mr Riccitiello said such acquisitions had to be founded on a belief that the franchise would last a very long time to justify the earnings multiples being paid. He said that EA had an “unbelievable portfolio of brands” for social and mobile with the likes of The Sims, Sim City and Bejewelled.“We don’t need to buy a brand just to get a temporary lead on top of the charts for whatever is hot this quarter,” he said.Mark Pincus, Zynga chief executive, told the FT on Monday that he expected long-term growth from Draw Something.EA was reporting its fourth quarter and fiscal year results to March 31. It reported $1.2bn in digital sales - ahead of the $1bn target it set a year ago.Its Star Wars: The Old Republic game shows how the mix of its business is changing. While available in traditional stores as a packaged disc, a digital version can be downloaded from its new Origin service and players also pay a monthly subscription for the PC online role-playing game.EA said it had sold 2.4m copies from its December launch to the end of March, but subscribers had declined from 1.7m to 1.3m in the past three months. The Silicon Valley company said a substantial number of dropouts were casual users ending trial subscriptions. The game was profitable and its fate was not key to the company’s fortunes, it said, representing only around 5 per cent of profitabilty expected in the current fiscal year.However, Star Wars will face fresh competition when Activision Blizzard launches its new online game Diablo III next week and EA’s shares fell 6 per cent in extended trading in New York.Investors may also have been disappointed by an outlook that fell short of analysts’ expectations, with EA blaming this on an unnamed major game being delayed and its decision to spend $80m this fiscal year on next-generation console development.Nintendo is expected to release the Wii U this year, but Microsoft and Sony are not expected to launch their next-generation consoles until 2013.While some analysts think the console era is coming to a close with TVs and other devices capable of handling high-quality games, Mr Riccitiello is still a fan.“We are strong believers that consoles will return to strong growth and represent a great opportunity, one that is in lockstep with our digital plans,” he said, adding that EA expected its digital business to grow 40 per cent this fiscal year.
74;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-04-26T21:20:09Z;US equities rise despite weak jobs report;;The S&P 500 shrugged off weak jobs data to reclaim the 1,400 mark during intraday trading for the first time since April 5. Meanwhile, the first-quarter earnings season was in full swing on Thursday as some of the largest US companies including PepsiCo and ExxonMobil reported results.Tax preparers H&R Block tumbled after the company said it would axe 350 employees and close approximately 200 offices as it warned earnings would fall short of analysts’ expectations.The accounting and financial services group dropped 10.7 per cent to $14.95 as it forecast revenues at about $2.9bn in the first quarter, falling short of consensus figures by $200m.Increased spending to compete against electronic providers of tax services such as Intuit’s TurboTax affected the company’s bottom line. Earnings are expected to come in between $1.09 and $1.15 per share for the three months to April 30 – well short of analysts’ predictions of $1.42.The company, with nearly 8,000 employees, said it would expect the cost cuts to “realise net annualised savings of $85m to $100m by the end of fiscal year 2013”.“Changes such as these are always difficult and we appreciate the hard work and dedication of all our associates,” said Bill Cobb, president and chief executive. “However, these steps are necessary so we can create a stronger company, invest in our future, and produce greater value for our clients and shareholders.”Shares in H&R Block have fallen 16 per cent over the past year, while rival Intuit has risen 4.8 per cent.Overall, the S&P 500 moved 0.7 per cent higher to 1,399.98, even as fresh labour data showed that first time weekly jobless claims declined by just 1,000 to 388,000, disappointing the markets and further suggesting that the US labour recovery had stalled.The leading index continued to build upon strong gains made a day before, with Apple boosting sentiment. Shares in the iPad and iPhone maker moved 0.4 per cent lower to $607.70, after gaining almost 9 per cent on Wednesday after it reported robust profits in its most recent quarter.Increased commodity costs and restructuring costs kept first-quarter earnings at US snacks and drinks company PepsiCo flat. The company said net income was $1.1bn, or 71 cents a share, slightly ahead of market expectations but flat from the same period a year ago.“Overall a messy quarter with acquisitions and spending noise making it difficult to assess the underlying health of results,” said Judy Hong, analyst at Goldman Sachs, who expected shares in the company to be muted in reaction to the results.Shares in PepsiCo were 0.5 per cent lower to $66.37 and are flat since the start of 2012.ExxonMobil, the world’s largest oil company by market capitalisation, said worse than expected first-quarter earnings were due to decreased production and lower natural gas prices.Shares in ExxonMobil moved 0.9 per cent lower to $86.07 as it reported pre-tax profits of $9.45bn in the quarter, down 11 per cent from the same period a year ago. Accounting for a $5bn share buyback undertaken in the first quarter, earnings were 7 cents lower than expected at $2 per share. The company said it planned to do another buyback of the same size in the second quarter.“We think ExxonMobil’s first-quarter results will have a negative impact on the shares’ near-term performance,” said Paul Cheng, analyst at Barclays, adding that the company fell short of expectations for its non-US earnings.Video game maker Electronic Arts jumped on reports that Nexon, a Japanese rival, was considering a takeover of the company. Electronic Arts rose 6.1 per cent to $15.93.Telecoms provider MetroPCS fell heavily after it reported first-quarter earnings that missed analysts’ estimates. Shares in MetroPCS declined 10.8 per cent to $7.08.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9 per cent to 13,204.62 as the blue-chip heavy index tried to bounce back from its muted performance on Wednesday, when Caterpillar said its business in key emerging markets, Brazil and China, was slowing.Shares in the manufacturer of earthmoving equipment gained 0.9 per cent to $104.39, having fallen almost 5 per cent the day before.Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer by sales, recovered 2.8 per cent to $58.95. The company, facing allegations of efforts to cover up bribery in its Mexico operation, made positive gains for the first time since news of the potential scandal broke over the weekend.On Thursday, the Mexican federal government said it would launch its own investigation into the methods used by the US retailer to obtain key permits necessary to launch its massive store expansion into the market.Shares in General Electric, the largest US industrial group, moved 0.9 per cent up to $19.62 after shareholders came close to winning a vote that would have given them greater say in the company’s decision-making on Wednesday.The Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.7 per cent higher at 3,050.61.Shares in Starbucks, the coffee chain, fell as much as 5 per cent as the company reported weaker-than-expected same-store sales for its second quarter after the market close.Amazon, the world’s largest internet retailer, soared as much as 15 per cent in after-market trading as demand for its Kindle e-reader helped revenues rise 34 per cent to $13.2bn in its first quarter.
75;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-04-02T19:13:07Z;Gibbs to lead Game Group’s revival;;Game Group, the struggling video games retailer, is to appoint a new chief executive to drive a turnround. The move comes a day after a deal to buy its British assets out of administration was announced.Martyn Gibbs, a former executive at the group, will take over the chain following the acquisition by OpCapita, the private investment firm, of the 333 stores that remained open after the group entered administration last month. Game’s former chief executive, Ian Shepherd, stepped down from the group last week.Mr Gibbs was managing director for Game in the UK, Ireland, northern and eastern Europe until the middle of last year. Before this he ran Gamestation, a rival chain that was acquired by Game in 2007.David Hamid, operating partner at OpCapita and former chief executive of Halfords, is to be appointed Game Group’s executive chairman, it was announced on Sunday.Game went into administration on March 26 after it was unable to pay a £21m quarterly rent bill, resulting in the immediate closure of 277 of its 610 UK stores and just over 2,000 job losses.The chain has been suffering from a decline in the video games market and a rise in competition from supermarkets and online retailers. It was dealt a further blow early this year when several main suppliers, including Electronic Arts and Nintendo, refused to provide key titles such as Mass Effect 3 and Mario Party 9.The deal with OpCapita, the financial details of which have not been disclosed, will safeguard almost 3,200 jobs. Game had owed £85m to its lenders, led by the Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays.OpCapita, which specialises in operational turnrounds, said on Sunday that it had no plans for further store closures or redundancies and that a small number of senior staff from Game Group’s head office who were made redundant last week would be re-employed.
76;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-03-20T21:00:45Z;Half of Game Group stores under threat;;The troubled video games retailer Game Group is expected to face the closure of as many as half its 600 stores under plans being drawn up by its banks.Two people familiar with the situation said the banks were proposing store closures at the chain, which is battling for survival as it races to raise a £180m lifeline by this weekend.Some analysts and industry experts suggested that up to 300 stores, about half of the store base, could be closed.The banks – led by Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays – and Game declined to comment, but it is likely that a store closure plan, already outlined by Game, will be accelerated.Peter Smedley, analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, said closing 300 stores in the UK and Ireland was “a plausible number for the dominant player in the UK”.Game Group said in July 2010 that it planned to reduce its store base from 677 to 550 by Christmas 2013. By January 2012, it had cut the number of stores to 610.Mr Smedley said that the group was likely to speed up the store closure programme given the “clearly worse than expected video games demand backdrop and the UK economy”.The prospect of store closures comes as Game, which employs 6,000 people in the UK, tries to secure a lifeline ahead of a deadline on Sunday, when it must pay three months’ rent to its landlords.A fully funded offer is on the table from OpCapita, the private equity group that acquired Comet for £2 last year, to acquire Game’s debt of about £100m, and pay its suppliers about £40m.Two people familiar with the situation said GameStop, the US video games retailer, had also expressed an interest over the weekend. GameStop could not be reached for comment.Hilco, the restructuring specialist, remains interested in Game’s international assets, including stores in Spain and Australia, although it is not thought to be pushing very hard with a proposal.The moves come amid increasing frustration around the Game camp at the pace of talks, ahead of the crucial payment deadline, with one person close to the situation suggesting that the banks were proceeding at a “glacial pace” despite the need for urgent action.Others have defended the banks, saying that they are working as speedily as they can, with all offers still on the table.Game said last week that it was “uncertain” whether discussions with lenders and suppliers would succeed, and that the stock could be left worthless.Rothschild, which had been advising Game on selling its international assets, has recently extended its remit to find a buyer for the whole of the group.Game was plunged into turmoil after a number of key suppliers said they would withhold blockbuster games. Electronic Arts and Nintendo both indicated last month that Game would no longer stock many of their releases, including Mass Effect 3 and Mario Party 9.Shares in Game closed up 0.01p to 2.39p on Tuesday.
77;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-03-12T21:46:13Z;Predators prepare to play for Game Group;;Potential predators are eyeing the assets of Game Group, as the struggling video games retailer fights for survival.Hilco, the retail restructuring group, is looking at Game’s international assets, which include operations in Spain and Australia, according to people familiar with the situation. However, Hilco is not interested in the UK business, which includes 600 stores,OpCapita, the private equity group that acquired Comet, could examine Game’s UK assets, given that it is a retail turnround specialist and there are potential synergies with Comet.The fresh interest in Game could mean competition for Gamestop of the US, which had been seen as the most likely buyer of Game’s assets. All parties declined to comment.Game’s shares fell 64 per cent to 1.28p, after it warned on Monday it was “uncertain” whether discussions with lenders and suppliers would succeed, and that the stock could be left worthless. The share price fall gives the company a market capitalisation of just £4.45m.Europe’s largest dedicated video games retailer by sales said it was also exploring alternative sources of funding and “reviewing the position of all of its assets”, adding that difficulties in securing new releases from several suppliers had persisted.Peter Smedley, analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, said that despite Game’s problems, parts of the group could still have appeal. However, given Game’s severe financial predicament, any buyer would be able to cherry-pick the best assets.Whether a retailer is crucial to its suppliers is proving to be the difference between life and death for struggling high street chains, writes Andrea Felsted.In January, HMVstruck a deal to survive the turbulent conditions on the high street, after key suppliers in the music and film industry took a small equity stake in the group.With HMV one of the only specialist retailers on the high street selling CDs and DVDs after the collapse of Zavvi and Woolworths, its suppliers acted to preserve their biggest route to market. The deal saw warrants representing 2.5 per cent of the group’s equity granted to key film and music suppliers, including Vivendi-owned Universal Music, Sony, Warner Brothers, Disney and Paramount in accordance with their share of HMV’s business.The support of JJB’s suppliers has also helped the sports goods retailer remain independent.“There is a powerful industry logic for the sports brands to give JJB continued lifelines,” says Peter Smedley, analyst at Charles Stanley Securities.In contrast, with a multitude of value fashion retailers able to bring goods to market, Peacocks enjoyed no such privileged position with suppliers. Although SKNL, the Indian textile group that was a supplier to Peacocks came close to buying the retailer, in the end it lost out to Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which struck a deal to acquire the bulk of the business.Similarly, Woolworths, which collapsed into administration at the nadir of the financial crisis in November 2008, was not seen as a vital outlet for its suppliers.“There was not a compelling structural reason for them to survive in any shape or form,” says Mr Smedley.The video games industry has been keen to support Game Group, its main high-street outlet, fearing that supermarkets and online retailers could further discount their software. But over the past few weeks, games publishers have been losing patience, forced to balance this ambition with limiting their exposure to any potential collapse.The group offered a dominant position in the physical video games market, as well as assets with significant realisable value, and a very short average store lease length profile in the UK, which could be profitably run off.“Game’s brands, assets and international operations will likely be attractive to several non-industry buyers for multiple reasons,” Mr Smedley said.Rothschild, appointed last month to advise the retailer on a strategic review, including the possible sale of its European business, has expanded its remit to look for a buyer for the entire company.People familiar with the situation suggested that Game has funding for the next three weeks. It was also possible that the banks could continue to fund the business thereafter.However, Mr Smedley said: “Imminent collapse into administration is now a real possibility.” In its first-half results last July, Game reported net debt of £91m, up from £63.5m a year earlier.Game’s problems follow a tumultuous period.Although recent years have seen a huge expansion in the number of people playing video games, thanks to Nintendo’s Wii, Facebook games from the likes of Zynga and Wooga, and the growth of mobile gaming on Apple’s iPhone and iPad, Game saw little benefit from the trend.The Wii is among the biggest-selling consoles of all time, yet its owners bought proportionately fewer games than “hardcore” gamers, who prefer Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.Those two consoles from Sony and Microsoft also have had a much longer lifespan than their predecessors thanks to internet-based multiplayer gaming and online updates to provide multimedia enhancements such as video and music. This has slowed down the industry upgrade cycle which drove much of Game’s growth.Piers Harding-Rolls, games industry analyst at IHS Screen Digest, said that Game might have made a mistake by increasing its exposure to the high street with the purchase of Gamestation in 2007, just a year before the games market peaked in 2008.“In hindsight perhaps that was overexpansion,” he said. The management which led that deal was replaced in 2010 by the current chief, Ian Shepherd, who had experience at British Sky Broadcasting and Vodafone. But he was left little time in a rapidly declining market to execute his new strategy, which emphasised loyalty cards, in-store gift cards for iTunes and Facebook, and an expansion of Game’s ecommerce business.Philip Dorgan, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said that while conditions have been tough, these could have been handled differently.“Could it have been better? Yes. Could [a new strategy] have been implemented earlier? Yes. Was there too much false hope in there? Yes.”
78;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-03-12T21:26:00Z;Small-caps: Game plunges on share warning;;Game Group plunges 63.5 per cent to 1.3p on Monday after the struggling retailer said its shares could well be worthless.Game fell by as much as 78 per cent to 0.8p after revealing it was in discussions with lenders and suppliers, exploring alternative sources of funding and “reviewing the position of all of its assets”.The company admitted that, while the discussions were going on, it had “not been possible to source new products from a number of suppliers”.Game has struggled since Christmas when a profit warning and potential breach of banking covenants sent the stock down 51.5 per cent in a week.The company recovered somewhat but was hit again at the end of February when Electronic Arts and Nintendo both indicated Game would no longer stock many of their releases.Singer Capital advised investors in Game “to realise value now rather than face losing out to a potential administration”.Mecom fell 7.9 per cent to 156½p after telling investors it would not be considering additional shareholder returns from the disposal of its Norwegian division, Edda Media, until 2013 at the earliest due to a payout needed to break a lossmaking contract.The European newspaper group agreed to terminate its commercial relationship with free-sheet De Pers after recording large losses due to the rapidly deteriorating conditions in the daily free sheet market.In March 2009, Mecom, via a subsidiary, entered into a 13-year contract to sell advertising in De Pers in return for the payment to Mountain Media of a fixed annual fee of approximately €2m in 2009, about €7m in 2010, approximately €16m in 2011 and rising on an indexed basis thereafter.To sever the contract, Mecom agreed to pay Mountain Media €35m on April 1 2012 and a further payment of €10m (plus interest) on January 1 2013.Gulf Keystone Petroleum fell 16.4 per cent to 240p even as an operational update from its Kurdistan projects indicated appraisal drilling and production increase was progressing much to plan.Seymour Pierce suggested investors might have been expecting more of an update from its Ber Bahr-1 well, which may have resulted in the market being slightly disappointed.Mining company Arian Silver fell 9.3 per cent to 25.6p, even as it increased silver production at its flagship San Jose mine in Mexico by a third.Stagecoach Theatre Arts surged 62.8 per cent to 63½p after confirming that Lifeskills Educationwas to buy the company for 65p a share, a premium of 66.7 per cent to the prevailing price. The offer valued the performing arts company at £6.5m.
79;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-03-12T11:49:53Z;Game almost over for retailer;;A computer gamer who is “killed” in Call of Duty or who tumbles off the rainbow road in Super Mario Kart always gets another go. But second chances are rare in business, as Game Group, the computer games retailer is finding out.An obsolete business model and a collective panic attack among counter parties mean that “game over” could soon be a permanent condition for the company, which employs 10,000 staff.Game has hinted that it is teetering on the brink of administration because suppliers such as Electronic Arts are withholding supplies of blockbuster games such as Mass Effect 3.This reflects a wider nervousness about the company’s prospects. Banks cut the working capital they were willing to lend to Game at the beginning of February. Around the same time, some credit insurers stopped agreeing to reimburse suppliers if Game could not pay them for stock.The mass effect (ho, ho) was to push the responsibility for keeping Game in business on to games companies, via better credit terms. But the much-vaunted need of games companies for a physical shopfront has not been compelling enough for them to rally round.Game’s basic problem is that with more and more games and consoles sold through other channels, it has lost its raison d’être.The remedies it devised – such as selling iTunes vouchers and Facebook credits – could not compensate for the logical flaws in its business plan. The sale of some parts of the business and the closure of others now seems inevitable.High-powered directorships remain jobs for the boysA woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle, according to a feminist aphorism. In contrast male-dominated boards need women recruits acutely, to fend off quotas favoured by meddling politicians. The broad trend is heading the right way, according to the Female FTSE Report 2012. But some directors are more equal than others. Highly paid, highly-powered executive directorships remain a largely male prerogative. It is right to ask whether women NEDs represent politically-correct window-dressing.In 2011, ex-banker Lord Davies stipulated that women should occupy 25 per cent of FTSE 100 board posts by 2015. Recently, scepticism has mounted over the achievability of this target. The total has risen just 2.5 percentage points to 15 per cent since 2010. However, academics behind the Female FTSE Report reckon this modest increase bespeaks gathering momentum that will give the sistren a 26.7 per cent share of posts by 2015.It is hard to read much into a rise in the proportion of female executive directors from 5.5 per cent to 6.6 per cent, since that reflects just two extra appointments. Easier, though, to see that it is a quick win for egalitarian box-tickers to appoint woman NEDs in male-dominated industries (which is most of them). Executive directors normally need detailed sectoral knowledge. For NEDs, an open mind and success in another field often suffices. Strikingly, the FTSE 100 boasts only one woman in the non-executive role that matters most, the chairmanship.A feminist joke from the angry seventies poses the question “What do you call 22 men lying dead on a football pitch?” The answer – “A start” – may also be used to describe rising numbers of women NEDs in FTSE 100 boardrooms. But with female directors of FTSE 250 companies still accounting for less than 10 per cent of the total, quotas could easily clatter on to the front burner. And that is where the real tokenism would begin.Show business is slowDarling, you were wonderful! That luvvyish greeting only applies to kids’ am-dram training company Stagecoach Theatre Arts with any honesty if you hark back to 2002. The shares, quoted on Aim in 2001, peaked at about 136p the following year. Like a washed-up former child star, they have not scaled the heights since. A plan to take the company private at 65p led by investor Shirin Gandhi has therefore won the backing of Stephanie Manuel and David Spriggs, Stagecoach’s co-founders, joint managing directors and majority shareholders.The role that Stagecoach has made its own is running weekend drama classes for the kind of time-poor rich kids also likely to learn horse-riding and the violin in the cause of a killer CV. The company promotes acting as a confidence booster, probably because well-heeled parents fear that stage-struck sprogs could mature into “resting” actors. But fees of £950 a year are likely to have had a bigger deterrent effect on pupil numbers in the downturn. Cheaper rivals are always nipping at Stagecoach’s heels. The supply of unemployed thesps willing to lead classes is inexhaustible, justifying Mama and Papa’s darkest fears.
80;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-03-11T20:27:59Z;EA chief’s comments raise more Game questions;;Comments by the chief of Electronic Arts, one of the world’s largest video games publishers by revenues, have raised further questions over the future of Game Group, the struggling retailer that seeks a buyer.EA is one of several suppliers, including Nintendo and Capcom, which began to hold back new releases from Game last month, a situation which EA has described as “unfortunate”.When asked last week about Game at a Wedbush conference in New York, John Riccitiello, EA chief executive, said it was “more likely than it was even a month ago” that a “major European retailer” would not “survive”.“One of the challenges that we have this quarter is we did flag a risk on one of the major European retailers having trouble, costing us sort of mid-single-digit EPS [earnings per share],” Mr Riccitiello said. “That now looks like all but a certainty. It was a risk a month ago. Now it looks like a fact, although we’re still praying for the lenders to get rational and keep them in business. You probably know who I’m talking about.”Despite this, he confirmed EA’s earnings guidance “in the middle of our range” for the current quarter.Game, Europe’s largest dedicated video games retailer by sales, has been hit by the lack of a leading console launch in recent years, creating an industry-wide slowdown and growing competition from online stores and supermarkets. Like-for-like sales fell by 12.9 per cent during the Christmas period, it said in early January.The video games industry has been keen to support its main high-street outlet, fearing that supermarkets and online retailers could further discount their software. But games publishers have been forced to balance this ambition with limiting their exposure to any potential collapse.At the end of February, it emerged that Game would not be stocking new releases from EA and Nintendo, including Mass Effect 3. More titles, including Capcom’s Street Fighter X Tekken, have since been unavailable at the retailer, although Sony, which held a midnight launch for its Playstation Vita console with Game on February 22, said it would be supplying upcoming releases such as Twisted Metal for PS3.Rothschild, appointed last month to advise the retailer on a strategic review, including the possible sale of its European business, has expanded its remit to look for a buyer for the entire company. People familiar with the situation said Deloitte had been lined up to advise the company, and PwC the lenders, on a potential Game restructure.Peter Smedley, retail analyst at Charles Stanley Securities said: “Whilst there is a powerful industry rationale for Game’s survival in the UK – the key video games suppliers see Game as a vital retail partner – some kind of insolvency process is looking increasingly likely to ensure that Game is rescued, albeit in a radically different form.”Mr Smedley said that Gamestop, the US specialist retailer, was the most likely acquirer for Game’s assets. “Whilst other interested parties may well emerge during the mooted sales process, Gamestop is the best positioned financially and strategically to pick up the assets it wants,” he said.Game declined comment.
81;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-03-09T07:33:32Z;Zynga rival plans IPO, EA sees red ocean;;It’s nice to see social gaming companies being sociable with one another – employees of Wooga, the third largest on Facebook, were mingling happily at Zynga’s headquarters on Wednesday night during its Happy Hour as part of the 2012 Game Developers Conference, being held here in San Francisco this week.Mark Pincus, Zynga chief executive, held an off-the-record dinner with we the media in another part of this rented building, which Zynga said on Monday it would now buy for $228m. I had on-the-record chats with Zynga’s three closest rivals Electronic Arts, Wooga and King.com on the fringes of GDC, with King.com’s CEO revealing its plans to join Zynga in going public. Highlights from those conversations after the jump.Frank Gibeau, Labels president, Electronic Arts(Second in social gaming to Zynga on Facebook with 49m monthly active users versus Zynga’s 247m, according to appdata.com)“We set some pretty audacious goals for the company in 2011 – we said we were going to grow share in the first-person-shooter category and we did – Activision’s Call of Duty lost share, we grew share – we sold 12-13m units of Battlefield 3, Star Wars: The Old Republic was the fastest growing MMO [massively multiplayer online game] in history when it came out, we launched Origin in June to be a content platform and in sixc months to December, we did $120m in revenues , we signed up 30 partners and 188m customers came through it. We are a strong number-two in social and growing with the success of The Sims, so we’ve really nailed our goals. We’ve told everybody we’re not just a packaged goods company, we’re an interactive digital company and our digital revenues reached $1bn a quarter earlier than we predicted. The way we’re trending, it’s going to be about 40 per cent of our revenues – $1.2bn – at the end of this fiscal year.What other successes do you anticipate beyond the Sims on Facebook?Facebook has gone from a blue ocean environment, where there weren’t many competitors and it was easy to find and accumulate customers and was cheap to acquire them, to where it’s now a red ocean, the cost of acquisition is high, Facebook isn’t growing like it was before, there’re a lot more competitors – and we’re very comfortable with that because this is where big brands matter and you can see how they can come into that environment with a ready-made audience making cost of acquisition cheaper. We have great production values and game design and Facebook users are demanding higher quality, premium experiences, so the dynamics are moving into our wheelhouse, and as you see the collision of social and mobile start to occur our leadership in mobile combined with those elements of social will give us a very strong competitive edge for the long term.This is a big week for you with the science fiction game Mass Effect 3 appearing.It went out Tuesday night in the US and, as of Thursday, we’ve sold through more than 1m units, it’s had I think 20 perfect review scores, so this is a big hit for us. [EA updated the figures on Friday to 3.5m units shipped] SSX [the snowboarding game] is also doing really wellWhat possibilities do you see with the new iPad announced this week?We are the number one publisher on tablets and we’ll continue to extend our lead, this is moving into our strike zone where assets that we’ve built for the console can now be translated over without having to dumb them down or simplify them. It saves us money and time in terms of development because the processors are so much faster and the display is now roughly equivalent to what we’re seeing oh high definition TVs.”Jens Begemann, the very tall chief executive and founder of Berlin-based Wooga , which has 48m monthly active usersHow did a European social games company become the 3rd largest on Facebook?It’s really about focusing on sustainable growth for the long run and engagement – bringing our players back over very long periods of time. Everyone talks about viral distribution and there’s an element of that which is relevant, but the most important thing really is that everyone who tries out your game, you make sure they keep coming back over a period of years – that’s the key to our sustainable growth.What’s that driven by?We get very creative and try to create very emotional games, but everything we do we verify with the numbers. So when we come out with a great new idea, we only put it out to 10 per cent of users and we see how it changes their activity and monetisation to see if our intuition is rightDo you plan to cover all the genres?I founded Wooga three years ago with this vision to create games for everyone – traditionally the game industry has concentrated a quite small niche – young males form 15 -30 – but we try to create games for everyone, so all of the genres that appeal to this mass audience are attractive to us.Do you look for a quick turnover of games?No, we do a small number of games and, after we launch them, the real work starts. So typically, for us, 80 per cent of our effort and investment is post launch – the team stays as big as it was and there are weekly releases. We’ve only done six games so far , but if you look at our four biggest, they were all at an all-time high last week and some of them are over two years old. That’s happening because we focus on this organic and sustainable development. Some people move over from one to another, but increasingly we see people playing two games at the same time.What is your focus in 2012?Two areas – Facebook, where we had 185 per cent growth in 2011, and the other is mobile – mainly iOS. Historically, we have been big in Europe, but if we look at where we are growing strongest at the moment, it’s the US and Brazil..,and Americans love Diamond Dash, which we launched in March last year and it now has 18m active users every month across three platforms. We have no plans at the moment regarding an IPO, we are private and happy that we can focus on long term growth and not the next quarter.Riccardo Zacconi , chief executive of King.com ( 31m monthly active users)“In January 2010, eight out of the top 10 Facebook games were resource management ones [like FarmVille] , there was one poker game and Mafia Wars. In January 2011, it was more or less the same except for a casual game, Bejewelled Blitz, at number 5. But in January of this year, five of the top 10 are casual games, one of which is Zynga’s Scramble with Friends and then the next largest is ours [Bubble Witch Saga] , so there’s a change now happening on Facebook in terms of what games are being played and who is playing them. I see a tiredness with the Ville games and so there are more genres now coming to Facebook. Our target is to cover the key genres of casual gaming, which we’ve been doing since 2003 when we had 10 people and launched in five countries. The company has been profitable since 2005.How have you been growing?In April last year, we ported one of our 150 games [Bubble Saga] on King.com to Facebook and put the social hooks around it and built it to have 140 levels and this took off. Now we’ve launched three games and we’ve gone from nowhere to being the fourth largest developer in nine months. We are taking the best games and porting them one after the other, we’ve gone from 100 people in January last year to 200 people in offices in places including Sweden, Romania, London and San Francisco.What are your targets?Within casual, there are different game genres – hidden objects,card games, bubble shooters, clicker games – our target is to be the number one in each genre. It’s more about having a focus on niche games where there are passionate users, such as Mahjong.Zynga’s freemium model in their resource management games is only half freemium – you can only play for seven minutes and then you have to wait for 20 minutes or come back tomorrow. We are bringing real freemium, because if you are a good player you don’t have to buy anything, you can play the game to the end. We have two paths: a good player does not have to buy extra lives to complete a game, but that is one way for some. But the good players are challenged to play competitively in our tournaments [skill-based with cash prizes]. We went from 300m game plays in January last year to more than 2bn game plays a month. We have 7.4m daily players on Facebook and the Bubble Witch Saga has 5.4m per day.Are you ready for an IPO?We are preparing the company, we are now reporting in US GAAP, we are updating the structure of the board , so that next year we can have the option. We have met bankers, we would look to list on the Nasdaq and we would seek a board member on the West Coast.”
82;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-03-07T17:30:11Z;Tech companies face fight for financing;;Ask a venture capitalist or entrepreneur to describe the UK technology scene, and the answer will be it has a “dumbbell shaped problem”.There is plenty of money available for very early-stage companies, from angel investors and serial entrepreneurs recycling their gains, and there is appetite for funding so-called “growth equity” companies that are already profitable and very close to being sold or floated on the stock market.But in the middle, where young, unprofitable companies are trying to raise funding rounds of £5m or £10m, interest wanes.Mike Reid, partner at venture capital firm Frog Capital says investors are loathe to tie-up their investments for long periods at this mid-stage, given the uncertain economic outlook.“Investors remain very nervous about illiquidity,” he says. “Pension funds and family offices value the option of changing their mind and getting their money out, but venture capital investments don’t offer that. There are companies that have been funded over 10 years that have still not exited.”Frog has funded businesses such as Rated People, the website for tradesmen, and Ecomera, which provides software to online retailers, but benefits from the backing of the multi-billionaire German-Spanish Engelhorn family, allowing it to take a longer-term view.Some technology sectors, such as ecommerce, are finding funding. Online shopping companies like Farfetch, Stylistpick.com and Fantasy Shopper have raised money in the past few months. But hardware and fundamental technology that require bigger investments have struggled.Icera, a start-up making mobile phone chips, tapped the venture capital community for more than $250m, and was still unable to successfully break into the market. The business was ultimately bought by Nvidia, a US rival, for $367m, little more than the original investment.“If you want to create a company like that from scratch you can't do it through the classic venture capital model because it takes 15 years,” says Stan Boland, founder of Icera, who had envisioned a $1bn float for the company. “We were insane to do what we did.”The $10.3bn Autonomy acquisition by HP aside, the lack of high-profile technology deals in the UK has also left investors uninspired.Ryan Notz, the founder of Mybuilder.com has mixed feelings towards the venture capital industry, writes Maija Palmer.“In the past two years I have been trying to raise money from VCs unsuccessfully,” he says. “Venture capitalists get very excited in the early stages when they think you might be the next Google or Facebook. But when the company turns out not to have a super growth-rate of 1,000 per cent – and most companies don’t – they are not interested.”His website, where people can find workmen for various home improvement projects, was one of the 2007 winners of Seedcamp, the respected London-based technology incubator programme, and raised early-stage money from investors such as Robin Klein, partner at Index Ventures, totalling £1.4bn in the six years since it was founded from angel investors such as Travis Perkins and Channel 4’s investment fund.Mybuilder.com employs around 15 people, has revenues of £3m last year, double that of 2010 and is “strongly profitable”, according to Mr Notz, a former stonemason. However, the company has still struggled to find further investment from venture capitalists.Mr Notz believes this may have been a blessing in disguise, allowing him to build the business in a more measured way.“If I had had a lot of money earlier I would have made all the same mistakes but in a more expensive way,” he says.But the lack of funding may also have forced Mr Notz to keep his ambitions modest. He is not attempting to build another £10.3bn Autonomy. His hopes are for a valuation in the “tens of millions”, a possible US launch, and ultimately selling the business.“The track record for European VC investment has not done well,” says Jos White, a former founder of MessageLabs, the UK security company that was acquired by Symantec, and now partner at Notion Capital, the venture capital firm. “Most people have made marginal returns, 2-3 per cent internal rate of return – it’s just about kept up with inflation. There are quite a few funds from the early 2000s vintage which really aren’t performing well.”In 2010, the UK government pledged to boost tech investment through a £200m innovation investment fund, focused on life sciences, digital and advanced manufacturing businesses. But venture capitalists complain that the money has been mainly directed at companies already well-supplied with funding.Investors are still willing to back teams with track records. The co-founders of Playfish, the online games company sold to Electronic Arts for $400m in 2009, have found a number of venture capital companies already angling to finance a B round for their new games venture Mindshapes.“It really helps that we know everyone and we have the track record behind us,” said David Begg, chief executive of Mindshapes. “But if you are an unknown team starting out it is really hard.”Over the past five years, the number of technology companies listed on the LSE’s tech sub-index has nearly halved to 81. The technology sector now accounts for less than 1 per cent of the LSE’s value, compared to around 8 per cent for the NYSE and 47 per cent for Nasdaq. Following the sale of Autonomy, Sage is the only remaining software company in the FTSE 100 index.There have been no technology floats in London since the spring of 2010, when EMIS, the healthcare software provider, and Promethean World, the educational technology company, listed. Promethean shares are still languishing at less than half their IPO price of 200p, deterring many others. Skrill, the online payments company, pulled its IPO last year, and Sophos, the UK’s largest IT security company, opted for a private equity deal after two unsuccessful attempts to float.Tech companies and analysts often blame London investors for lacking imagination and courage with technology investments.“Fund managers bemoan the dearth of new blood in the UK quoted technology sector but are unwilling to pay a growth multiple for a growth business on float, instead demanding a discount because of the lack of track record,” says Jonathan Imlah, technology analyst at Collins Stewart.Bankers point out, however, that funds are still struggling with existing portfolios of low-growth technology businesses and are unwilling to invest in anything new until they have cleaned out the old.Simon Russell, technology banker at Hawkpoint, says: “Many City funds are frankly bruised from the underperforming tech and internet IPOs they’ve bought over the last couple of years and also from their painful legacy holdings of struggling ex-growth license software businesses.”
83;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-03-04T22:57:51Z;Giving a FIG about potential Autonomys;;Over the clink of wine glasses on the sixth floor of the BBC’s White City headquarters, entrepreneurs are taking turns to showcase their companies to the near-overflowing room.A training harness for rugby forwards, an online platform to stimulate ideas among staff, and pre-packaged ingredients for cook-at-home meals are a few of the half-dozen or so start-ups on show.As disparate as the companies might seem, they have one thing in common – all were initiated by university students or recent graduates, and given a chance at life by a start-up funding group, which in this case was Find Invest Grow (FIG).Although the chances are slim, any of those start-ups could replicate the success of Autonomy, the ex-British software company that began from similarly humble circumstances and was bought last year by Hewlett-Packard in a $10bn deal.But does the UK create the right ideas and possess a suitable commercial environment to nurture another Autonomy?In January, Prime Minister David Cameron gave his “StartUp Britain” speech in Leeds, where he declared that 2012 was “the year when we get behind Britain’s grafters, do-ers, hard workers and entrepreneurs”.“There is only one sensible and sustainable way to grow your economy and that is through brave people starting and growing businesses, employing people and creating wealth,” he said. According to the Department for Business Innovation and Skills, small and medium-sized enterprises account for almost two-thirds of UK private sector employment and about half of private sector turnover.At the start of 2011, the UK’s 4.5m businesses with fewer than 250 staff earned £1.5tn in turnover and employed 13.7m people – hence their importance to the country’s economy.Autonomy, founded in Cambridge by Mike Lynch and Richard Gaunt in 1996 as a spin-off from Cambridge Neurodynamics, grew to become the UK’s largest software company by sales.Much of Autonomy’s excellence was attributed to Mr Lynch – a rare example of a British academic turned technology entrepreneur who has taken a start-up through to becoming a world leader in its field.“UK awareness around start-ups is continuing because of the trend in the US,” says James King, managing director of FIG, but added the caveat that British investors lacked the appetite for risk displayed by their counterparts across the Atlantic.“The UK is very good at coming up with ideas, but we’re not so good at commercialising them,” he says.“We don’t have the environment for exits, but we certainly do for entries. It’s not liquid – you’re in it for the long term, anywhere from three to 20 years.”The start-up ideas that are put forward are wide-ranging, says Mr King, but tend to have a bias towards technology and web-related companies.The high-quality education provided at UK universities ensures a solid stream of commercially viable ideas, says Mr King, with FIG receiving 3,000 business proposals each year from potential start-ups seeking seed funding. Roughly 4,000 businesses were started up by graduating students in the UK in 2010.Robert Parker, acting chief executive of TMO, a bioethanol group, says that having a commercial end goal is essential before embarking on any start-up, no matter how intriguing the idea may be.TMO, whose technology ferments food and crop waste and distils it into bioethanol, has raised £50m in three rounds of fundraising, with particular attention from China.“We are lucky to be in one of the more attractive spaces – there is a huge driver for energy security,” he says.Other avenues open for potential start-ups include being picked up by listed funding companies such as IP Group and Imperial Innovations.IP Group has come to prominence after its early-stage backing of Oxford Nanopore – the British technology group that in February unveiled the world’s first miniature DNA sequencer. Imperial Innovations, itself spun out of Imperial College London to commercialise research, last year invested £35m in its businesses after raising £140m in December 2010.Other initiatives to unearth viable companies include the “start-up Challenge” – a competition to find the UK’s best new innovative business ideas.The event offers start-ups the opportunity to get themselves seen at the Digital London event at London’s Docklands on March 13-14, with the winning entry – selected by a public vote – receiving £5,000 of prizes for their business.“One of the problems is the lack of entrepreneurial community in London,” says David Begg, chief executive of Mindshapes, a start-up games company founded by some of the team behind Playfish, the social network games group bought by Electronic Arts for $400m in 2009.“We all know each other but there aren’t any forums. It is not centralised. A lot of people who make their money just drift off.”
84;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-03-02T20:54:14Z;Small-caps: Acquisitive Alecto climbs 7%;;Miner Alecto Minerals jumped 7.1 per cent to 1.9p on Friday after completing the acquisition of an Ethiopian mining company and beginning the purchase of a second.Alecto bought Nubian Gold Exploration, which owns the Aysid-Metekel Gold Project, and made its first share-based payment on Rift Valley Resources, which owns the smaller Wayu Boda Gold Project.Game Group recovered 7.3 per cent to 5.2p as investors looked past the retailer’s announcement earlier in the week that it was suffering from supply issues in relation to a number of Electronic Arts and Nintendo computer game titles.Seymour Pierce said it was increasing its full-year 2012 estimate of pre-tax losses from £10m to £18m and was assuming a full-year 2013 pre-tax loss of £18m for Game.“The key to short and medium-term share price performance is cost-cutting and judging whether Nintendo’s Wii U launch, expected spring 2012, and the Sony PlayStation Vita handheld will kick off a fourth-generation hardware cycle,” the broker added.Seymour Pierce downgraded its price target from 10p to 2.5p because of the risk that Electronic Arts withdraws all future titles over the year and other suppliers follow suit.Cove Energy lost 8.2 per cent to 207½p after press reports about a possible tax charge to be levied on the oil explorer by the government of Mozambique prompted Cove to say it was “seeking clarity” on the issue.Cove has soared 82.8 per cent since the start of the year on the back of takeover bids from Shell and PTT Exploration while an Indian consortium also declared an interest.Invista Real Estate bounced 7.1 per cent to 8.7p after confirming it would continue to return capital to shareholders in 2012 as it seeks to realise value from an orderly disposal of its assets. Invista returned £4m to shareholders in June 2011.Robert Walters, the recruitment company, gained 2.8 per cent to 245¾p after its 2011 results met market expectations.Numis said it remained positive on the shares for both the its structural growth and cyclical recovery potential but did not believe the results provided a catalyst to push higher. The broker maintained its “buy” advice with a target price of 310p.

86;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-03-02T17:22:00Z;RSM Tenon leads small caps;;RSM Tenon, the accountancy firm, won the small caps race this week, soaring 41.9 per cent following positive results and a cost-cutting plan involving deep staff cuts.RSM declined 29.1 per cent in January after a profit warning and the news its then chairman and chief executive would be stepping down.Thomas Cook had a mixed week, finishing up 33.8 per cent despite falling 20.4 per cent on Thursday following a downgrade by broker Investec.It had gained over 40 per cent since the start of the week after takeover speculation.Scottish software company Craneware jumped 37.5 per cent after it secured a deal worth a minimum $7.5m with an unnamed US partner.Troubled engineering company Cosalt advanced 27.8 per cent after its shareholders voted to maintain its status as a publicly listed company, against the wishes of its chairman David Ross, who controls more than half of the company and had bid for the rest.BowLeven was the biggest loser of the small caps, plunging 29 per cent after Dragon Oil said it was no longer interested in acquiring the Cameroon-focused oil explorer.BowLeven said it had not held detailed discussions with Dragon and had not provided due diligence information.Game Group was also hit, falling 12.4 per cent, after saying it had a “supply issue” with Electronic Arts computer game Mass Effect 3, which meant it would be unable to fulfil orders.
87;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-02-29T23:38:32Z;Game Group hit by withdrawal of key titles;;The latest releases by two of the world’s largest video games publishers will be unavailable at Game Group stores from March, raising questions about the troubled retailer’s future.Electronic Arts and Nintendo both indicated on Wednesday that Game would no longer stock many of their releases, including Mass Effect 3 and Mario Party 9.The high-street retailer’s shares fell by 16 per cent to 4.92p after news of the problems was published by industry websites such as Eurogamer.Game confirmed that it would not be stocking a “small number of titles” from Electronic Arts in March. “This situation – which is a result of ongoing discussions between the group and EA – is a temporary one and indeed both businesses are already engaged in discussions about future launches together,” Game said.The company added that the two groups were “committed to ensuring that this situation does not occur again”.Nintendo provided the Financial Times with a list of suppliers for its forthcoming releases, which in March will include Kid Icarus for its 3DS handheld console and Mario Party 9 on the Wii, that did not include Game Group stores.The retailer had no comment about Nintendo other than that it was in “ongoing discussions” with all suppliers after a late February meeting with partners.Electronic Arts, the world’s second-largest games publisher by sales, did not comment on Game.In its third-quarter update at February’s start, John Riccitiello, Electronic Arts’ chief executive, told investors that a reason for the publisher’s “conservative” outlook was that it was “concerned with the financial condition of one of our major European retail partners, [a situation] which could lead to both increased bad debt and [to] lost sales”.
88;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Small-caps: Bid talk lifts Thomas Cook;Strong retail interest in travel group;Thomas Cook was up 22.8 per cent to 28¼p on Wednesday after takeover rumours fuelled heavy retail interest in the troubled travel company.Peel Hunt analysts, while not ruling a takeover out completely, said such a move was very unlikely. Peel Hunt has a target price of 1p for the company.Thomas Cook has gained over 80 per cent since the start of the year but is well away from its 2011 high of 204.8p.Game Group, which has struggled since announcing poor Christmas results in January, fell 16.3 per cent to 4.9p after saying it had a “supply issue” with Electronic Arts computer game Mass Effect 3, which meant it would be unable to fulfil orders.Game has fallen 30.4 per cent since the start of the year but recovered somewhat from a low of 3.3p in early January after agreeing new lending terms with its bankers.Recruitment company Nakama lost 28 per cent to 2¼p after a profit warning sent investors running.The company said the costs of recent investments in the business combined with lower permanent placement volumes than expected had hurt profits.Seymour Pierce described the news as disappointing but remained confident about the company’s long-term prospects. However, the broker moved it from ‘buy’ to ‘hold’.Bookmaker Sportingbet dropped 9.5 per cent to 38p after results revealed a growing divide between its successful Australian operation and the rest of its business.“Overall the results are in line,” said Numis. “However, the Australian business, fully regulated and accounting for over half the revenue, is blowing the lights out and has potential upside from regulatory change.“This outperformance may be offset by the business in Europe, now without Turkey, which is seeing deteriorating revenue in Greece and Spain and is cutting costs to restore profitability.”The broker recommended that clients buy with a target price of 90p.ATH Resources, a UK-based coal miner, fell 7.6 per cent to 30½p after revealing that rising fuel costs and falling coal prices had hit margins.Healthcare Locums, which provides staffing solutions in the health and social care sectors, dropped 17.7 per cent to 2.8p after former shareholders filed suit against the company in the US, alleging misrepresentation.The suit, brought by US fund managers Permian, Arundel Capital, Privet Capital and Flinn Investments, is aimed at the company and some former directors.Namakwa Diamonds lost 11.4 per cent to 8.2p after its trading update resulted in its being cut to “hold” by Liberum.Liberum said that although the diamond company had progressed to commercial production, its funding situation remained tight.The company had “drawn down $31m of the $40m facility issued by largest shareholder Jarvirne [32.5 per cent of shares] and has a further $3m on call . . . Given the weaker cash flow we see material risk of a further short-term financing need to get the company across the line”, the broker said.
89;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-02-09T23:47:57Z;‘Call of Duty’ franchise boosts Activision;;Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest video game publisher, reported fourth-quarter sales and profits ahead of Wall Street expectations, powered by the continuing success of its Call of Duty franchise and a new children’s game that sold more than 20m associated toys.The company also revealed it was stemming subscriber losses to its World of Warcraft online role-playing game and said it would begin targeting Facebook as a major gaming platform.The Santa Monica-based company reported fourth-quarter revenues of $2.4bn and earnings per share of 62 cents, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $2.2bn in sales and 56 cents.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was the industry’s best-selling game in 2011. Released in November, it achieved $1bn in sales in its first 16 days.The company also benefited from the success of Skylanders: Spyro’s Adventure, the best-selling title last year for six- to 11-year-olds. More than 20m “smart” action figures, which interact with the game when they are placed on a “Portal of Power” pedestal, were sold during the fourth quarter.A sequential loss of 800,000 subscribers to 10.3m for World of Warcraft which concerned analysts in the third quarter, fell to a 100,000 loss in the fourth.The company has ignored Facebook and social gaming to date, but Bobby Kotick, chief executive, suggested in an interview with the Financial Times that this was about to change.“Facebook continues to make great investments in making itself more robust and interesting for us as a gaming platform, “ he said. “We definitely view Facebook as a very significant new opportunity.”Activision would compete with its main rival Electronic Arts and newcomer Zynga on Facebook. EA is also mounting a challenge to World of Warcraft with its Star Wars: The Old Republic online game.But with downloadable content, such as map packs for its Call of Duty games, Activision is ahead in digital revenues. It said they reached $1.6bn and accounted for 34 per cent of total sales in 2011. Its recently launched Call of Duty Elite online service had grown to 1.7m paying subscribers by the end of January.For 2012, there will be a new Call of Duty game and a follow-up Skylanders game called Giants for the holiday season. Blizzard, the creator of World of Warcraft, plans a number of releases after no new titles in 2011.Activision forecast revenues of $4.5bn for the year, virtually flat compared with 2011 and slightly below analyst forecasts of $4.567bn, as it predicted a negative $200m foreign exchange impact.Its shares rose just over 1 per cent to $12.80 in extended trading in New York.
90;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-02-08T19:29:15Z;Small-caps: Bango jumps on Facebook deal;;Bango, the mobile payments and analytics company, soared 39.6 per cent to 137½p on Wednesday after revealing it had signed an agreement to provide payment services to Facebook.Neither company has revealed the precise nature of the deal and Bango said it was too early in the relationship to accurately forecast the level of business it may generate.Bango has already struck deals with Research In Motion, online retailer Amazon, gaming company Electronic Arts and Gameloft, a mobile games pioneer.DCD Media gained 126.3 per cent to 7¾p after Timeweave, the media-focused investment company, revealed it had acquired just over £3m of convertible loan notes in the Aim-traded independent TV production and distribution group.Timeweave paid about £2m for the debt, which has a maturity date of October 1. The debt earns interest at 8 per cent per annum, which is rolled up, and nearly £2m of the loan notes are convertible into ordinary shares in DCD at 18p while the remainder are convertible at 1p.Conversion of the loan notes is possible up to a maximum of 29.9 per cent of DCD’s total share capital. Timeweave advanced 8.1 per cent to 25.1p on the news.Ambrian Capital tumbled 27 per cent to 9.1p after its trading update revealed larger writedowns than previously reported and an operating loss of nearly £2.5m.The natural resources investor said a previous additional writedown of £1.5m related to its investment in Ambrian Partners would be increased to £2m but it did not expect any further losses relating to Ambrian.Europa Oil & Gas jumped 19.5 per cent to 11½p after reporting better than expected half-year production and revenue results. The oil explorer, which has three producing assets in the UK, all in the East Midlands, said its half-year revenues increased 61 per cent over the same period in 2010, to £2.4m.The surge in revenue was due to a 23 per cent increase in volume produced, to 187 barrels of oil per day, and a 39 per cent increase in the average oil price to $108.9 per barrel.Ailing travel operator Thomas Cook also rose, by 5.8 per cent to 13¾p, on the back of better than expected results with its UK share of winter and summer bookings “broadly stable”.Peel Hunt, advising a target price of 1p, said that although “the update could have been worse . . . there are clearly significant trading challenges outside the UK, and for us a major concern has always been the late summer booking market. Given the European consumer backdrop and the structural issues facing the group, we would continue to avoid the shares.”The company also said it was to open a formal sale process for its 77.1 per cent shareholding in Thomas Cook India, for which it had received several unsolicited approaches.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs declared a raised shareholding in Thomas Cook of nearly 4 per cent.Mothercare advanced 7.7 per cent to 217p after announcing Simon Calver’s appointment as its new chief executive.Mr Calver had been CEO of Lovefilm International since 2005, during which time it was acquired by Amazon.
91;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-02-08T11:58:17Z;Facebook’s deal with Bango points to new mobile app payments;;Listen carefully in the City of London and, very faintly, you may be able to hear the bell ringing for round two of Facebook’s simmering battle with Apple over mobile apps.Bango, a small mobile payments firm, quietly announced to the stock market on Wednesday that it has “signed an agreement to provide payment services to Facebook”.Bango and Facebook are both tight-lipped on the details of the deal. “The board believes it is too early in the relationship to accurately forecast the level of business which it may generate,” Bango said. But shares in the company leapt by a third on the news, taking its valuation to £40m, on expectations that the deal will be worth quite a lot to the 13-year-old firm.That’s a long way short of Facebook’s expected $80bn+ valuation when it goes public in the spring, but the deal could be worth a lot to Facebook, too.Bango provides many kinds of mobile payments and analytics services, but most interesting to Facebook is likely to be its carrier-billing capabilities. Research in Motion already uses Bango to allow BlackBerry owners to pay for apps through their mobile-operator contracts, saving them the hassle of entering credit card details on the small screen.In December, Bango struck a deal with Amazon, although details of that agreement have not been revealed either. Other clients include Electronic Arts, a leader in Facebook gaming, and Gameloft, a mobile games pioneer.Allowing Facebook’s 425m mobile users to pay for apps or buy virtual goods in games on their smartphones without having to fiddle around with inputting payments details on a small screen will be critical if the social network is to build out its Credits business in emerging markets.As the FT has previously reported, mobile was cited as a significant risk factor in Facebook’s S-1 filing because it does not generate any “meaningful” revenues from usage on portable devices, which is an increasingly large part of users’ overall activity on the site. Mobile advertising, expected to be launched in the coming weeks, is one way to tackle that problem, but that doesn’t address the wider strategic risk – which Facebook also flagged – that it is currently reliant on mobile platforms operated by its sometime rivals, Apple and Google.Last year, after a summer of feverish speculation, Facebook launched a new iPad app and opened up its mobile platform to third-party developers for the first time. But Facebook was unable to allow users of its iPad and iPhone apps to use Facebook Credits to buy tractors on Farmville, as they do on the desktop version of Zynga’s game, due to Apple’s rules around in-app payments. The Cupertino computer company demands a 30 per cent commission on all purchases within the App Store.Facebook does enable such transactions on its mobile web app, which is accessed through the iPhone’s browser rather than the App Store and is therefore exempt from Apple’s tax. But if Facebook really wants to make paying for virtual goods as seamless as it is through Apple’s iTunes, carrier billing is a smart solution.While paying for apps through the phone bill will improve the user experience in more mature markets like the US and Western Europe, analysts say it’s especially critical as Facebook begins to tap its next billion users in regions without a fixed-line internet infrastructure. Says Ian Maude, head of internet at Enders Analysis:“Many people with mobile devices in emerging markets are not going to have credit cards or bank accounts. A lot of people in those markets will only access Facebook via mobile devices and the only way they can transact online is through something like Bango, where you can charge it back to the mobile operator… It’s very hard to see someone like Facebook agreeing to pay Apple 30 per cent. They are effectively another platform operator.”Bango’s chief executive Ray Anderson wrote on the company’s blog last June – when TechCrunch first reported on what it called Facebook’s “Project Spartan” to take on Apple – that his company had “strong support” for web apps, which use HTML5 technology to create rich, app-like experiences in the browser:“Bango technology has been optimized for browser deployment, and we see the browser as a great platform to enable truly explosive growth of mobile by making apps less dependent on the handset operating system. If you want to share an App or service with others, it makes more sense to mail or tweet out a link to a web app than to try to get your friends to download apps! It seems like Facebook may have the same vision… Bango provides payment services that work really well in web apps.”If that reads like a pre-emptive sales pitch, it seems to have worked. Now we (and Apple) must wait to see how aggressively Facebook – which is in its pre-IPO quiet period – plans to deploy Bango’s technology.
92;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-02-02T22:28:45Z;The force is with digital, mobile games;;Two trends clear in Facebook’s IPO filing on Wednesday were the inexorable rise in importance of digital-based gaming revenues and the growth in mobile – we learned Zynga was a key revenue-generator for Facebook and half of Facebook’s members were now users of its mobile products .Earnings and data from Electronic Arts, THQ and Japan’s Gree over the past 24 hours further emphasise that the old order of disc-based console gaming will have a declining share of consumers’ attention, as consoles become more general entertainment boxes and smartphones and tablets proliferate.EA shares closed 6 per cent higher at $19.57 on Thursday after analysts viewed its fiscal third-quarter earnings in a positive light.Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities said it was poised for a strong year due to its unrivalled digital strength. He predicted digital revenues would grow more than 40 per cent to $1.7bn in its next fiscal year, starting in April. The momentum would be provided by subscription payments for its new Star Wars:The Old Republic online role-playing game, the release of Sim City on Facebook being delayed till the next fiscal year and the increased adoption by consumers of Origin – its platform for digital delivery of games that now has more than 1m daily users.Doug Creutz at Cowen and Company said management guidance of double-digit revenue growth in the next fiscal year and accelerating digital growth suggested the current consensus on EA was “significantly too low”.Analysts at Macquarie Equities Research said they continued to be believers in EA’s ability to ramp margin on digital revenue and reiterated an Outperform rating and $26 price target.Compare that to the declining fortunes of THQ: it announced last week it was having to get out of its longstanding involvement in children’s games and focus on its more adult, core successes such as the Saints Row and UFC and WWE fighting games.It said it would also focus on digital initiatives for the future. In its quarterly earnings release on Thursday, it reported that digital revenues, while unspecified, more than doubled on the year-ago quarter – a result, it appears, of the success of its disc-based Saints Row: The Third game (3.6m units shipped in the last quarter), with its associated downloadable content.THQ has been overly dependent on disc-based games and has been suffering of late. On Wednesday, it reported Brian Farrell, chief executive, and his board would receive a 50 per cent cut in their compensation for one year, while 240 jobs would be shed in a new restructuring round. The Nasdaq is threatening to delist the company, whose share price has fallen below $1 recently.In contrast, Japan’s Gree, whose mobile and social gaming platform offers 7,500 games, reported on Thursday it had reached 190m registered users globally by the end of December and earned profits of $167m in the last quarter on $555m in sales. It raised its profit forecast for the year from $472m to $617m.
93;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-02-02T21:06:21Z;New tech stocks surge on Facebook’s IPO fizz;;Facebook’s $5bn IPO filing was a fillip for recently debuted internet businesses.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,859.68, handily outperforming other big US indices as stocks from Chinese social network Renren to offers website Groupon surged.Zynga benefited the most. Shares in the social-game developer climbed as much as 20 per cent to hit an all-time high of $12.91 before closing at $12.39, a gain of 16.8 per cent.That came after Facebook’s filing revealed Zynga accounted for 12 per cent of Facebook’s 2011 revenue, up from 10 per cent in the prior two years. Zynga shares ended the day comfortably above their $10 IPO price, for the first time since the company’s own stock market debut in December.But other moves appeared to have little to do with any Facebook-specific information.Professional networking website LinkedIn climbed 8.2 per cent to $76.87, Groupon climbed 7.4 per cent to $23.08 and Renren was up 8.2 per cent to $5.42. SINA, a Chinese social-media company, which owns a Twitter-like service, climbed as much as 5 per cent before closing up 1.9 per cent to $75.30.“This rally is really all about sentiment,” said Herman Leung, a tech analyst at Susquehanna. “We’re seeing big share price moves for anything with a whiff of social about it on no real news, while old school internet companies underperform.”Yahoo slipped 0.1 per cent to $15.72 and Google climbed 0.7 per cent to $585.11.Elsewhere, US stocks were generally flat with the S&P 500 inching up 0.1 per cent to 1,325.54.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,705.41, as Pfizer fell 0.9 per cent to $21.11 after the drug maker recalled 1m packets of birth control pills amid fears that faulty packaging could potentially lead to unwanted pregnancies.Merck shares also fell 0.5 per cent to $38.44 although Pfizer’s rival swung to a fourth-quarter profit, beating analyst expectations. The second-largest US drug maker by revenues predicted a relatively flat 2012, with profits expected to be hit by cheaper generic forms of its biggest product, asthma drug Singulair.Retail stocks were volatile as clothing stores updated investors on fourth-quarter expectations.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch slumped 13.7 per cent to a 52-week low of $40.40, as the clothing store warned fourth-quarter profit will come in well below expectations.The company said sales growth of 16 per cent in the quarter ended January 28 was driven almost exclusively by new store openings, as same-store sales came in flat.Rival clothing company Gap jumped 10.6 per cent to $21.52, despite forecasting a fall in same-store sales across its brands of 4 per cent and a 2 per cent fall in overall sales. Analysts had been braced for much worse, but sales at Banana Republic stores surprised on the upside.However, Robert Drbul at Barclays Capital noted that apparel, footwear and textiles stores underperformed the S&P 500 in January, while, “exposure to Europe remains a concern given the soft macroeconomic environment”.Earnings were responsible for other big movers, with JDS Uniphase falling 7.2 per cent to $12.19 even though quarterly earnings came in better than expected as the fibre optics manufacturer recovered strongly from supply-chain disruption in Thailand.Nikos Theodosopoulos at UBS downgraded JDS to “neutral” from a “buy” recommendation, telling clients that, “while orders looked good we struggle to place a higher than 15 [times earnings] multiple on JDSU’s cyclical business.”Qualcomm shares climbed 2 per cent to $60.73 as strong sales of smartphones drove demand for its wireless networking products, helping deliver better than expected fiscal first-quarter results and strong guidance for 2012.“A healthy market, ongoing share gains and conservative guidance should yield further upside in the shares,” said Jeff Kvaal at Barclays Capital.CME Group rose 8.4 per cent to $257.13. The largest US exchange group by market capitalisation said fourth-quarter profit rose, with a tailwind from an Illinois tax benefit. Meanwhile NYSE Euronext rallied 1.9 per cent to $26.94 after retreating on Wednesday, as the European Commission blocked its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse.Electronic Arts gained 6.1 per cent to $19.57 after the second-largest US video-game publisher reported a 70 per cent increase in third-quarter profit.MasterCard shares, which climbed 66 per cent in 2011, were on the move again, gaining 6.7 per cent to $381.57. The credit-card company delivered strong earnings, once a $495m after-tax charge against litigation was stripped out of fourth-quarter numbers.
94;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-02-02T19:25:51Z;Zynga shows the importance of friends;;When Zynga filed for its initial public offering, investors were concerned about its substantial reliance on Facebook, the social networking platform on which the vast majority of its games are played.But it turns out that Facebook is just as dependent on CityVille, FarmVille and other Zynga titles as the gaming addicts who buy digital tractors, mansions and landmarks for their virtual worlds.Facebook takes a 30 per cent slice of any purchases of these virtual goods in games made by Zynga and its rivals, such as Electronic Arts and Wooga. Zynga is also one of Facebook’s largest advertisers. Together, revenues from Zynga users’ purchases and its advertisements made up 12 per cent of Facebook’s revenues in 2011, or $445m, its single biggest source of income.That dependence is growing, too, up from less than 10 per cent of sales in 2010 and 2009, according to Facebook’s IPO filing on Wednesday.“If the use of Zynga games on our platform declines, if Zynga launches games on or migrates games to competing platforms, or if we fail to maintain good relations with Zynga, we may lose Zynga as a significant platform developer and our financial results may be adversely affected,” Facebook warned.Similarly, at the top of Zynga’s own list of risk factors was the warning that it needs to stay friendly with Facebook: “If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with Facebook, our business will suffer.”Zynga is also among the peer group of companies that Facebook will use to benchmark its executive pay. Mark Pincus, Zynga’s chief executive, was an early investor in Facebook, though that stake is now worth a fraction of 1 per cent, while the social network’s former chief operating officer, Owen Van Natta, sits on Zynga’s board.The companies’ interdependence could cut two ways, says Simon Mansell, chief executive of TBG Digital, a social marketing agency that counts gaming groups among its clients.“In a negative way, they have a dependency there on one customer, which is never what you want,” he says. “But in a positive way, that business was created on the Facebook platform. As more businesses build on the platform, it shows what can happen when Facebook opens up to more segments.”In 2010, at the same time as Facebook required all games developers to adopt its virtual currency credits, the company also clamped down on how app providers such as Zynga could send messages to users.Some users saw excessive amounts of postings from their friends’ Mafia Wars as spam that cluttered up their newsfeed. But for Zynga, automatically inviting friends to play along was a vital part of its growth strategy. When it was removed, the relationship between the two groups cooled to a freeze for a few months until they agreed that Facebook would take a maximum 30 per cent cut on gamers’ purchases on Zynga games.The knock-on effect of the changes was that without that free viral channel, Zynga had to start buying a lot more advertisements to maintain its growth rate.“These changes limited the level of communication among users about applications on the Facebook platform. As a result, the number of our players on Facebook declined,” Zynga said in its filing. “Any such changes in the future could significantly alter how players experience our games or interact within our games, which may harm our business.”After tense negotiations in spring 2010 between Mr Pincus and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive who is 18 years his junior, the pair struck an agreement guaranteeing Zynga will use Facebook credits as the “primary means of payment” for games on the site, in exchange for Facebook taking a commission of “up to” 30 per cent (other games companies hand over a straight 30 per cent). That deal expires in just over three years, in May 2015.Facebook’s description of the events leading up to this in its S-1 filing almost reads like an apology to Zynga, noting that its action “reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetisation opportunities from, apps. In some instances, these actions have adversely affected our relationships with platform developers”.The 16 per cent climb in Zynga’s shares in early trade on Thursday underscores how important the relationship remains in spite of those changes. “We believe the relationship between Zynga and Facebook is far more symbiotic than investors believe,” wrote BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield. “We believe Facebook wants/needs Zynga to be successful.”Analysts at Macquarie, who have a neutral rating on Zynga stock, said the details revealed by Facebook suggests the gaming group may miss its fourth-quarter revenue estimates.But Zynga investors already seem to be looking past such concerns. Its shares have recently surged from $8 to above its $10 IPO price, and opened more than 16 per cent higher on Thursday morning in the wake of Facebook’s filing, to $12.34.Additional reporting by Chris Nuttall in San Francisco
95;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-01-23T21:04:43Z;A hub for the new Dubliners;;"The builders are working overtime at PopCap Games, a US company that is expanding its European headquarters in Dublin’s “Silicon Docks” neighbourhood. Internet behemoths such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and Zynga have also set up shop here.“We’ve taken the floor above us to expand further,” says Paul Breslin, PopCap’s general manager for Europe, Middle East and Africa. “It’s not much to look at now, but we’ll have capacity for 160 people when it is ready.”PopCap, a Seattle-based company acquired by Electronic Arts for $1.3bn last year, is one of an army of US technology companies defying the worst recession in Ireland for generations by adding jobs and bringing new operations into Dublin. Last year the sector created 4,000 jobs – a significant boost for an economy struggling with 14 per cent unemployment and a huge debt burden that prompted a European Union and International Monetary Fund bail-out in 2010.Ireland now hosts nine of the 10 biggest global technology companies. New investments have included a $500m expansion of Intel’s chip manufacturing facility in Kildare and a decision by social network company Twitter to establish its international headquarters in Dublin – a prize that had been eagerly pursued by London.Demand for technology staff has become so competitive that companies are having to recruit from abroad, offering high salaries and perks such as free massages, flexible working and sleep pods.It is a far cry from the working conditions experienced at most Irish companies that are trying to sell products into the domestic market, where employees are living with the threat of redundancy, pay cuts or longer hours for no more pay.“Despite the turmoil experienced by the economy over the past four years, Ireland is still an attractive location for multinationals for a number of reasons. The 12.5 per cent [corporate] tax rate is a cornerstone and for that reason must be protected,” says Barry Dixon, head of research at Davy Stockbrokers.Ireland’s English speaking, pro-business regulatory environment and young, educated workforce are persuasive factors for multinationals looking for a gateway to serve the European market, he says.For PopCap, the biggest single factor in locating in Dublin was the availability of talent. “We need to be able to serve the European market from here so we need people who speak languages and have technological and analytical skills,” says Mr Breslin. “Only after that did we consider the corporate tax rate.”Half of PopCap’s 85 employees are Irish while the other half are international. Some of the international staff have relocated from abroad while others were poached from other technology companies in Dublin. And like many of the social networking and gaming companies that have recently set up operations in the city, the vast majority of its employees are in their 20s or early 30s.Marta Callava Linares, a 28-year-old expert in software localisation from Madrid, is typical. “I’m really happy working in Ireland,” she says, in between updating PopCap’s Spanish fan pages on Facebook. “It’s given me a huge opportunity that I wouldn’t have had in Spain. The job situation is not good there at the moment.”Dublin’s reputation as a technology hub makes it an attractive place to come and work for foreign staff aiming to gain experience working at multinational companies.This is just as well given a growing skills shortage in Ireland that is beginning to push up wages and prompt more companies to expand their overseas recruitment.Microsoft
At the company that started the influx of technology companies in 1986, the quality of the subsidised food at Microsoft’s Irish headquarters is famous. Free massage, pool tables and comfortable chill-out zones are all recent additions. Flexible working is the new mantra at the software company with a large number of staff now able to work regularly from home.But it is not a case of “all play and no work” in the sector. One former Microsoft employee says that although the company pays well, demands results. “They want a piece of you and it is high-pressure stuff. It is not unusual to work late or at weekends,” he says.Google
Google’s 2,000 staff are among the most pampered in Ireland’s technology sector. On top of high wages and a bonus culture, staff working at the “Googleplex” get free food and have access to music rooms, sleep pods and an on-site gym. The company has also recently applied to build an on-site swimming pool.IBM
Big Blue’s staff have “The Hive” – an entertainment zone where they can play pool, video games and watch television. They can also take language lessons or do yoga. The company also has an initiative called “Buzz”, which encourages employees to socialise together.Successive governments have been criticised by industry for not investing enough in education. There are now calls for more to be invested in teaching computer skills to ensure that the current wave of investment endures.“Companies have no choice,” says Hugh McCarthy, manager of the IT division at Brightwater Recruitment. “To find the necessary talent it is often necessary to look outside Ireland. We work with companies who have development teams made up of eastern European, Asian and South American developers.”At Microsoft’s European headquarters in the Sandyford suburb of Dublin, about a third of the company’s 1,100 staff are non-Irish. When Bill Gates chose Dublin in 1986 as the hub to localise its software for Europe, it attracted the first wave of foreign technology graduates to Ireland, which by 2000 had become the world’s biggest software exporter.“I wanted to further my career and Microsoft presented a great opportunity,” says Duncan Bloom, a South African who moved to Dublin six months ago to take a position as a planning director at its interactive entertainment division. “It is a very multicultural workplace. I have six people reporting to me: one from Holland, one from Poland and four Irish.”The city of Dublin is also a draw for international staff because it is English-speaking, has a young population and offers a good standard of living.“There is no doubt that Dublin is a place where smart people from around the world like to congregate and live,” says Paddy Cosgrave, a 28-year-old who set up F.ounders, an annual meeting of 200 of the most influential technology entrepreneurs in Dublin. “There is a particularly vibrant atmosphere in Dublin where the social networking companies are locating.”Silicon Docks has also been transformed in recent years. Most of the decaying warehouses and derelict buildings have been replaced with coffee shops, trendy restaurants and apartments, and a new theatre. There is little evidence of the Irish recession, which has claimed 300,000 jobs since the Celtic Tiger economy peaked in 2007.The recession has also brought down costs for companies locating in Ireland. Commercial property prices are now 60 per cent off their peak. This has proved a disaster for the banks and developers that fuelled the property bubble but it has significantly reduced start-up and expansion costs for foreign multinationals. Electricity prices for large users also fell 27 per cent in 2010, according to state enterprise agency, Forfas.Recruitment consultants say there was some moderation of wages in the technology industry in 2008 and 2009. But for those working at the big technology companies there have been none of the big wage cuts implemented in many domestic companies.Maja Djordjevic, a programmer from Serbia who was recruited by Microsoft two and half years ago, says the recession has not had a big impact on companies such as hers. “My pay has stayed the same while a lot of people have lost their jobs or had their pay cut. The only consequences I’ve experienced are lower prices in the shops and restaurants,” she says."
96;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2012-01-13T01:50:45Z;Zynga nabs another EA exec;;"The social gaming leader Zynga has lured away another top Electronic Arts executive, hiring Barry Cottle (pictured) as head of business development.The news represents a blow to EA, which lost its chief operating officer John Schappert last April when he took up the same position at Zynga. Mr Cottle was head of Interactive at EA, covering the mobile and social gaming areas where EA is in direct competition with Zynga.EA has been focusing on the high-growth areas of mobile and social to generate more digital revenues from app downloads and virtual goods.In a memo to staff on Thursday, John Riccitiello, chief executive, announced that, in 2011, EA had achieved its goal of passing $1bn in annual digital sales.He said he appreciated Mr Cottle’s contribution “to the evolution of our mobile and social business and for building a great team of leaders”.But the EA chief also announced a management reorganisation that effectively made Mr Cottle’s position disappear. All parts of the company were now involved in digital, he said, so EA Interactive would be folded into EA Labels and the global publishing organisation.“This reflects our new reality: everyone and everything is digital,” he said.EA spokesman Jeff Brown said of the loss of Mr Cottle: “ We’re flattered by the recognition of EA’s bench – but doesn’t Zynga have ANY confidence in their own bench strength?”In a Zynga statement, John Schappert said of the new hire: “ “His tenure and background is unparalleled; I’ve always admired his ability to grow businesses and inspire teams. I’m proud to say he’s a colleague again.”Mr Schappert himself was brought into EA in 2009 to replace an executive leaving for a social gaming company – John Pleasants, who went to Playdom.Before EA, Mr Cottle was chief operating officer at Palm Computing’s Wireless and Content division and previously spent nine years at Walt Disney as a marketing executive.Zynga shares closed at $8.45 on Thursday, about 15 per cent below last month’s $10 IPO price."
97;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-12-22T20:22:59Z;Games start-ups losing ground;;Facebook’s ranking of the most popular games on the social network revealed that larger developers such as Walt Disney’s Playdom, Zynga and Electronic Arts are stretching their lead over smaller start-ups.Facebook apps has historically been seen as a fertile market for entrepreneurial companies to build a user base quickly. But Facebook’s analysis of games with more than 100,000 monthly users found better-resourced firms were getting higher user-satisfaction scores as the market grew more professionalised.“The barriers to entry have certainly risen in the past year,” said Steve Bailey, games analyst at IHS Screen Digest, a consultancy. “It’s a market that’s achieved maturity very quickly. Competition is now at saturation and the cost of acquiring users is far greater than it used to be.”Zynga, which floated on the stock market this month, built its business on the back of Facebook’s growth. The Californian company developed four of the top 10 most popular games of 2011, according to Facebook. Independent market tracker AppData ranks Zynga as the largest developer by monthly users, with 225m globally. Nearest rival Electronic Arts has 54m users, followed by Wooga, an independent firm, with 35m.But industry observers were surprised that Facebook’s data showed Playdom’s Gardens of Time pipped Zynga’s Cityville to the number one spot, as Disney’s $400m acquisition of the social games developer started to bear fruit.Electronic Arts’ $400m acquisition of Playfish in 2009 has also proven a success, with its Sims Social taking second place in the Facebook rankings.Scale is vital in the Facebook app market because it gives developers a springboard for new releases, creating a virtuous cycle that Zynga has exploited. But investors see opportunities for new entrants. In May, Caesars Entertainment, the casino operator behind Harrah’s and Caesars Palace, was reported to have paid $80m-$90m for an initial 51 per cent stake in Playtika, maker of Slotomania-Slot Machines, the ninth-ranking Facebook game.“By the third quarter of 2011, the level of investment in games was almost double 2010, and the level of M&A was more than double 2010,” said Tim Merel, managing director of Digi-Capital, a technology-focused investment bank. “Whether 2012 or further out, we anticipate that both investment and M&A in online and mobile games should continue to accelerate.”Mr Merel and Mr Bailey both predict that the social games market will converge with mobile games in the next 18 months, as Facebook becomes hooked into more smartphones.
98;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-12-18T18:31:56Z;Electronic Arts seeks online gaming share;Star Wars launch to compete with World of Warcraft;A long time ago in a galaxy not so far away, Electronic Arts was the number one video game publisher and Activision its closest rival.Then Activision joined forces with Vivendi’s games unit in 2008 to become the industry leader, adding its Blizzard division and World of Warcraft, the biggest online role-playing game.But now the empire is striking back. EA launches Star Wars: The Old Republic on Tuesday, with hopes of winning the loyalty of online gamers to the George Lucas sci-fi franchise and eventually overtaking World of Warcraft.The stakes are high because the video games industry is now one of the biggest parts of the entertainment sector, having overtaken the film industry several years ago. In the US alone last year, $25.1bn was spent on games compared with $10.5bn taken at the box office.Silicon Valley-based EA has had some success in taking on Activision Blizzard in the “first-person shooter” genre, in which players see the virtual world through the eyes of their character, who is typically armed with a gun. Its Battlefield 3 sold more than 5m copies in its first week, although its rival’s all-conquering Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3sold 6.5m copies in its first 24 hours when going on sale in November.Star Wars has had an encouraging testing phase, with 1.6m gamers volunteering to play an early “beta” version and nearly 1m pre-orders for the game, a copy of which will cost $60 plus a monthly subscription.World of Warcraft has more than 10m subscribers worldwide, but Ray Muzyka, co-founder of BioWare, the EA studio that makes the new Star Wars game, says it has the potential to be even bigger, given the power of the brand.“We know from market research that a lot of MMO [massively multiplayer online] players are actively looking for the next big thing and they actually consider Star Wars to be that, either from personal experience of going through the beta or knowing someone who is in it,” he says.World of Warcraft does appear vulnerable at present. Activision shares fell in November when it reported continuing and more rapid declines in subscriptions – down to 10.3m in the third quarter from more than 12m at the start of the year.The company said most of the decline could be attributed to Asia, where China represents more than half of the global player base.“We think there’s a very vibrant community. There’s new content coming next year and we’re not spending a lot of time thinking what our competitors are doing,” says Bobby Kotick, Activision chief executive.Michael Pachter, video games analyst at Wedbush Securities, sees Star Wars winning a 10 to 15 per cent share of the $10bn MMO market.“It will take some of that from World of Warcraft, but I have confidence Activision can get its numbers back up through growth in places like Brazil and China,” he says.Star Wars: The Old Republic is set 3,000 years before the rise of Darth Vader and features 1,000 actors’ voices. Players buy the game and then pay a subscription of around $15 a month to continue exploring its universe, with LucasArts receiving royalties from EA.
99;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-12-14T19:05:18Z;Zynga eyes growth paths as IPO pricing looms;;As Zynga was running its IPO roadshow last week, there was a timely boost on the tarmac at Los Angeles airport for the leading social gaming company.The actor Alec Baldwin was ejected from an American Airlines flight after he hurled abuse at the cabin crew for telling him to stop playing Zynga’s Words With Friends game and turn his phone off.His addiction extended to him locking himself in the lavatory to play the Scrabble-like game before being ordered off the plane.This was great publicity for the San Francisco company, which issued an official statement in the form of an image of its gameboard with the phrase “Let Alec Play” laid out in tiles.The incident helped it to illustrate that not only did it make compelling games, but the company had more to offer than FarmVille on Facebook – the game and platform with which it is associated.With Zynga’s shares due to be priced on Thursday – its offering is expected to raise over $1bn, making it the biggest tech IPO since Google’s in 2004 – investors have been looking hard at how Zynga can grow within and beyond Facebook and in the face of increasing competition.Words With Friends is available on Android and Apple platforms, with the company offering both free and premium versions of the game. Analysts at Wedbush Securities estimate Zynga could be earning $6m a month in app sales on just the iPhone, with 3.2m of the 16.7m Zynga apps downloaded in October paid for by users.Mobile would still be only about 7 per cent of total revenues, but Zynga is expanding here – it bought Newtoy, developer of Words with Friends, a year ago as part of a strategy of global acquisitions of game companies. Another acquisition, Bonfire Studios, is responsible for Zynga’s latest Facebook hit, CastleVille, which brings a new sophistication to the Ville series of games.This fresh injection of creativity helps Zynga answer critics who see it as being driven too much by its intensive analysis of player behaviour, resulting in formulaic follow-ups.“They are in an excellent position in gaming on an important platform, but they’re at the point where there has to be a realisation that, with what has worked for them so far, they’ve sort of hit the wall on that,” says Doug Creutz, video game analyst with Cowen and Company. He says a modest increase in daily active users in November, with the launch of CastleVille, has to rank as a disappointment and there has been “essentially no growth in [daily active users] for two years despite an accelerating frequency of new title launches”.Zynga’s problem has been a cannibalisation of its earlier games, as users quickly move on to the newest title in the Ville series.As CastleVille went from zero to 22m players in November, CityVille and Empires and Allies lost 9 per cent of their players while Zynga’s Mafia Wars 2 and Adventure World were down 20 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. Michael Pachter, video game analyst with Wedbush Securities, sees more positive signs, noting Zynga’s total monthly gamers have grown around 9 per cent to 220m since mid-October, when Facebook adjusted the way it counted users.He cites three ways Zynga can grow – through the continued growth of the Facebook platform, now at over 800m users, by persuading users to play more of its games and by engaging them to spend more money on virtual goods, the source of $575m out of $600m in 2010 revenues for Zynga.The roadshow has revealed why 7.7m players – less than 5 per cent of users – chose to buy such goods from Zynga over the past year.They buy “energy” to extend game time, gifts for family and friends, decorations and buildings such as haunted mansions and boosters to accelerate their progress or help them overcome obstacles.Zynga’s presentation has a bold vision – one slide shows a CityVille skyline where Google Search, Amazon Shop and Facebook Share skyscrapers stand shoulder to shoulder with a huge Zynga Play merry-go-round.Traditional publishers such as Electronic Arts with The Sims Social and Ubisoft with The Smurfs & Co, as well as rising social gaming start-ups such as Europe’s Wooga, would challenge this picture of Zynga dominance.But Michael Pachter says its size and current leadership are a big advantage in cross-promoting games and moving large numbers of gamers to new ones.“There’s room for others to take share, but I do think Zynga is like Google in search,” he says. “It might lose share slightly, but I think Zynga knows what it’s doing and will keep the momentum going.”
100;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-12-12T19:29:58Z;‘Call of Duty’ sales outstrip blockbuster films;;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, the latest instalment in Activision Blizzard’s hit war-game franchise, has realised $1bn-worth of sales in 16 days, outpacing blockbuster movies including Avatar and Harry Potter, but marking a slowdown after its record-breaking first week.MW3 outsold Activision’s two previous Call of Duty instalments, Black Ops and Modern Warfare 2, with $400m in first-day sales and $775m in its first five days, demonstrating the growing importance of a Hollywood-style opening weekend sales and marketing blitz.Activision is claiming a new high-water mark for video games in the entertainment wars by reaching $1bn in sales one day faster than 20th Century Fox’s Avatar, an indication of the ever-wider appeal of gaming beyond its teenage-boy origins. James Cameron’s 3D sci-fi epic set the previous record for reaching that milestone in 17 days in 2009, before going on to overtake Titanic as the biggest-grossing movie of all time, with total takings of $2.78bn, according to Box Office Mojo, the film website.Some industry observers have suggested that MW3’s stronger opening might lead to a faster fall-off in sales, after three-quarters of the 16-day total were achieved in the first five days.But Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, told the Financial Times that sales of Black Ops remained stronger than he expected a year after launch, due to online multiplayer gaming.“Those prior releases are continuing to sell at rates higher than what we’ve seen previously,” Mr Kotick said. “Even though MW3 is selling faster, the thing driving the success of those games is the social experience and online play.”Black Ops leads a ranking by NPD Group, which tracks American sales of the biggest-selling games titles in the US, with $900m in sales to date after selling $360m on its first day. Estimates suggest that MW3 has sold more than $500m in the US so far while Black Ops has sold around $1.4bn to date globally. NPD says MW3 US sales in November were 7 per cent higher than Black Ops during the same period last year.MW3’s $1bn global sales figure is largely comprised of physical disc sales but Activision’s new COD Elite online service, which provides extra statistics and add-ons for players, has also sold a little more than 1m premium subscriptions.The world’s two largest video-games companies are set to go head to head again next week with EA’s Star Wars: the Old Republic taking on Activision’s long-running massively popular multiplayer online game, World of Warcraft.
101;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-12-10T03:36:53Z;Game sales break November record;;Video game publishers have had their best November on record in the US, according to the NPD research firm, with hard-core gamers loading up on two first-person shooters and a classic role-playing game.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 from Activision was the top-selling title, with Electronic Arts rival, Battlefield 3, at number three, and the highly-rated Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (pictured) from Bethesda Softworks splitting the two shooters.NPD reported disk-based game sales of $1.67bn, up 15 per cent on last November. Modern Warfare 3 sales exceeded those of Call of Duty:Black Ops a year earlier by about 7 per cent.Anita Frazier, NPD analyst, said on Friday: “In one month, Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is just about half a million units shy of matching Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in lifetime sales. Its first-month performance was a five-fold increase over Oblivion’s first-month sales. The game garnered outstanding review scores.”Battlefield 3 was also now the best-selling title of that franchise.“The critically acclaimed Batman:Arkham City sold well in month two at retail and is now just shy of Batman: Arkham Asylum’s lifetime unit sales,” said Ms Frazier.Batman came in at number 10, with Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed:Revelations and Just Dance 3 – the only family/casual title in the Top Ten – filling out the Top Five.The software sales figures beat analyst expectations – Wedbush Morgan had predicted a 3 per cent rise to $1.50bn, while Cowen and Company predicted a 10 per cent rise.In hardware sales, the Xbox 360 was the top-selling console in November, as it has been all year, with the gap between the 360 and the next-best selling platform the widest since December 2008, when the Nintendo DS was the top selling system.Microsoft said it sold 1.7m units, while the Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii failed to break the million barrier. Nintendo reported 860,000 Wii sales and 795,000 3DS sales – the biggest month to date for the handheld console. Sony gave no specific numbers but said hardware sales were up 70 per cent on a year ago.
102;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-12-08T00:01:19Z;Social networks bring speed and challenge to companies;Electronic groups can be highly effective but should not replace traditional communications;"Business communications have seen dramatic change over recent years. Fifteen years ago, companies were still debating whether email would be beneficial or a time waster that should be banned. Now most executives would find it hard to imagine operating without it, and newer forms of communication such as instant messaging and social networking are beginning to work their way into the corporate fabric.Mark McDonald, co-author of The Social Organization: How to Use Social Media to Tap the Collective Genius of Your Customers and Employees, estimates that around 70 per cent of companies have tried social media for external marketing communications, and around 20 per cent started to bring it into the company to connect employees.Such companies as Deloitte, Electronic Arts, Cemex and Ford as well as organisations including the FBI and Nasa have started using these kinds of tools for collaborative working and trying to find better ways of tapping into employee resources.Deloitte, for example, introduced Yammer, a corporate equivalent of Facebook, earlier this year and already has 4,600 of its 12,500 UK employees using the service to discuss everything from information technology strategies to ballet.One of the biggest changes the new communication tools bring is speed. Decisions and changes can happen faster by harnessing a social network.Cemex, the world’s largest building materials supplier, for example, used social networking tools to brainstorm ideas for increasing the company’s use of biofuels. Within five weeks, measures had been adopted and a 5 per cent increase for biofuel usage had been achieved, a process that would otherwise have taken 18 months.“Adoption of ideas in a collaborative community is more rapid,” Mr McDonald says. You feel more ready to adopt ideas because you have directly taken part in the decision.”However, the increased speed of communications also puts pressure on companies.“One of the consequences of technology is that managers have to react much more quickly,” says Jonathan Grudin, a researcher at Microsoft. “People are getting more informed more quickly and they can force management to react more quickly.“The style of management has to change. The manager that wanted to have three days to think things through on a decision will struggle when an answer is expected in six hours.”In an era where customer reactions are played out on Twitter within moments of an event, companies can sometimes appear painfully slow in responding.When the BlackBerry network suffered a three-day outage in October, customers berated Research in Motion for taking several days to give out information about what was happening with the service.At the same time, traditional hierarchies at work are being challenged by technologies that give even relatively junior people rapid access to information.“A manager in a large meeting might instant message one of their subordinates to get some information they need in order to shine in the meeting,"" Mr Grudin says. “It is one of the cases where companies find instant messaging very useful. But those very quick informal queries change ongoing relationships. For the subordinate, it could demystify the manager as someone who has all the information to hand.“Professors tell me it is difficult to stay more informed than they best students because the students have more opportunity to go online and get the latest information. So they are learning from their students, albeit reluctantly. There is a breakdown in traditional hierarchies,” he adds.Companies are becoming increasingly aware they need to adapt to a new generation of technology users.“As managers, we need to be aware of the next generation of employee who uses technology very differently – younger people have an ability to time slice between multiple activities very quickly,” says Colin Bannister, chief technology officer at Computer Associates. “As a new generation comes into the workforce, we need to design workplaces that meet their expectations.”Social networking can help build cohesion in an office. Knowing from personal profile postings that a colleague is a sailing fan, for example, can provide a conversation-starter that might otherwise have taken a long time to establish.“Once upon a time, secretaries were numerous and maintained the social fabric in organisations by circulating cards, sending reminders, organising small celebrations and distributing news. Social networking software may restore social capital that office automation has slowly eroded,” Mr Grudin wrote in a 2009 paper.However, social networking also poses tricky questions of etiquette. Does one need to accept a boss’s Facebook request? If work colleagues are included among Facebook friends, must status updates be toned down or censored?Mr McDonald says he knows of one professional services company where the in-house social networking service turned into an informal dating site, and had to be closed down after complaints from female employees. However, he stress that misuse is very rare.“Companies can generally successfully relay professional behaviour on to social media,” he says.Above all, experts warn that companies should never consider electronic communications a complete substitute for face-to-face interaction. People still need to talk to each other. A few years ago, Pace, the UK set-top box manufacturer, for example, encouraged its engineers to start interacting more with each other in real life, by installing a recreational facilities such as pool tables in its offices.Mr Grudin says that while electronic communications can be highly efficient, they should not be relied on too heavily. “You have to be aware this is just a projected persona,” he says. “It may not be getting across some things that are important.”"
103;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-12-06T18:00:08Z;Hollywood tint to a very Modern Warfare;;The television advertisement for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, the new video game from Activision Blizzard, features movie stars Jonah Hill and Sam Worthington shooting their way through a landscape of urban destruction.Playing to a celebrity-obsessed culture where video games are increasingly mainstream, the widely-viewed clips and online viral videos helped propel the title to record sales of $400m on its first day.The showy Modern Warfare 3 ad also comes at a time when top tier video game releases are bigger than Hollywood blockbusters and game companies are looking to produce more television content that can be viewed by online gamers.Modern Warfare 3’s success is a testament to the enduring popularity of the “first person shooter” game, which in the 17 years since the release of Doom, the first popular title in the genre, has become a fixture on computers and game consoles such as the PlayStation and Xbox. Another big seller in recent weeks has been Battlefield 3, the new first-person shooter from Electronic Arts.But some analysts are concerned about the health of Activision’s main franchises. The online multiplayer World of Warcraft has lost 1m subscribers during the year. In addition some video game industry analysts are wondering if the Call of Duty franchise, which has sold more than 100m units overall, has peaked.Activision chief executive Bobby Kotick said in an interview with the Financial Times, however, that the first-person shooter category still had room to grow. “When you think of great game concepts, I think that unleashing your inner soldier is a great one,” he said. “There’s a lot to love about it.”The company reported strong quarterly earnings last month and raised its earnings forecast, but its shares have fallen more than 10 per cent since.The star-studded Modern Warfare 3 commercial was part of an unprecedented blitz of video game marketing. Electronic Arts spent heavily promoting Battlefield 3, and games such as Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Activision’s World of Warcraft with advertisements featuring actors including Chuck Norris.“The crowded release schedule triggered competitive behaviour, with more marketing spending than we have seen in past Novembers,” said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush. “We think that the huge marketing push from publishers and competitive retail climate could help sales throughout December.”Activision has partnered with Tony and Ridley Scott, the film directors, to create a TV programme called Friday Night Fights featuring highlights of Modern Warfare 3 game play. The show will be available for viewing on the Call of Duty Elite network, a new $50-a-year online social network.The Elite network, which Activision launched last month, stumbled out of the gate due to glitches brought on by high demand. But more than 1m users signed up in the first week, giving Activision a handsome new revenue stream.Other examples of video games embracing filmed content include Madden Nation, a reality show on Disney’s ESPN sports network that features gamers playing Electronic Arts’ Madden NFL game. Twitch.TV, a website launched earlier this year, features live broadcasts of video games and chat in online forums.“This is an important evolution of our medium,” said Mr Kotick, suggesting that Activision would release more television-style programming soon. “It would be logical to think you could produce [scripted content] that you could watch in the games.”One worry for analysts is that Activision does not yet have any major games on Facebook, while its main rival Electronic Arts has two of the top ten by users. Nor has Activision acquired any major social gaming companies. Electronic Arts bought Playfish in 2009, and Disney acquired Playdom last year. Zynga, the largest social gaming company, is preparing to go public. Mr Kotick said Activision was investing in the Facebook platform but had nothing to announce for the time being.However, the company is still working to develop new franchises with the release of Skylanders, a game targeted at children, which includes action figures that respond to the onscreen action. “Skylanders was this idea that you can bring your toys to life,” Mr Kotick said.Mr Kotick said Activision may not have enough supplies of the new game to meet holiday demand. But Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said that although it was on track to sell “reasonably well” it still had not cracked Amazon’s closely watched Top 20 titles.“With any new intellectual property, you never know how well it will be received,” Mr Kotick said of the Skylanders launch. “This was just something new.”
104;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-11-18T01:37:53Z;Zynga’s pre-IPO management shuffle;;Zynga has announced that Owen Van Natta, the former Facebook executive and chief executive of MySpace, has resigned from his position as Chief Business Officer at the leading social gaming company ahead of its IPO, surrendering 4.64m share options in the process.The news came in a regulatory filing detailing management changes and new numbers on users – the kind of detail requested by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a public offering nears.Mr Van Natta, 41, joined the company in August 2010 and 2.11m of his 6.75m share options had already vested after one year. The company stated his total option awards had a fair value of $28.6m and the board had “determined that this size of the award was necessary given the other employment opportunities available to Mr Van Natta at the time of his negotiations with the company”.That does sound rather a lot though.Mr Van Natta, who resigned on Wednesday, will remain on the board and can exercise his vested options over the next three years.People familiar with the situation told the FT the executive had always planned to be in an executive position for a limited amount of time as he helped to build the company. He had helped to bring in executives now carrying out the day-to-day duties such as John Schappert, the former Electronic Arts chief operating officer who has taken up the same role at Zynga.Zynga also announced that Brad Feld, a managing director of the Foundry Group VC firm, had resigned from the board, to be replaced by Sunil Paul of Spring Ventures.Zynga broke out, on a quarter-by-quarter basis, numbers of paying players, which topped 3.4m in the September quarter – Zynga sells virtual goods in its games. In addition, the filing reveals booming mobile numbers – daily active users on mobile platforms grew more than ten-fold from November 1, 2010 to September 30, 2011 and reached 9.9m during the third quarter and 11.1m in October.Zynga launched the latest in its “Ville” series of games this week. CastleVille follows big hits such as FarmVille, FrontierVille and CityVille – although each successive game has sucked users out of its predecessors.Wedbush Securities social gaming analysts said in a report on Thursday that CastleVille would be closely watched to see if Zynga could recoup lost traffic and continue to grow in time for its IPO, which is expected by the end of the year.Wedbush had reported Zynga’s monthly active users (MAUs) fell by 58m or 22 per cent between October and November to 205m, although it noted the Facebook platform had changed the metrics in this period by removing from the statistics those users who played without logging in.A change in measurement criteria reducing numbers dramatically is the last thing Zynga needs this close to an IPO, with analysts already criticising the lack of growth in its user base despite new game releases.
105;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-11-16T13:11:04Z;Game Group warns on further profit fall;;Game Group said it would post its first loss in a decade-and-a-half as the video-game retailer blamed “ wider consumer uncertainty” for its disappointing sales.Shares in Game lost almost half their value as investors took fright at the first UK high street retailer to warn on profits ahead of the crucial Christmas trading season.“We are facing the doubly whammy of very tough consumer spending and a cyclical low point in new hardware releases,” said Ian Shepherd, chief executive. “Our guidance today reflects the extraordinary economic times in which we are operating.”Mr Shepherd downgraded full-year performance from a projected fall in like-for-like sales of 0 to 3 per cent to “no better” than a 7 per cent decline, and that gross profit margins would decline by 150 basis points, rather than the 100 previously forecast.High street video-games retailers – of whom Game is Europe’s largest – have struggled amid increasing competition from supermarkets and the internet, as well as a dearth of large console launches. This year’s only console launch, Nintendo’s 3DS handheld, has not sold as well as expected, prompting a price cut shortly after its debut.Game said sales in the year to November 12 fell 8.6 per cent, on a like-for-like basis, although this outperformed the wider games market, which was down 12.3 per cent in the first 41 weeks of the year. Sales fell across all units, including hardware, software and accessories, although ecommerce revenues were flat, after the launch of a new web sales platform earlier this year.“Today a 10-year-old boy is probably playing Club Penguin or Moshi Monsters. If you’re a traditional retailer you don’t see that,” Mr Shepherd said referring to company’s “embryonic” digital division which saw revenues increase by 40 per cent.Only last week, Activision Blizzard declared that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3became the biggest-selling entertainment launch of all time, generating $400m in revenues in the first 24-hours on sale in the US and UK.But Mr Shepherd said that although other large software launches, which have included Electronic Arts’ Battlefield 3 and Fifa 12, have performed in line with expectations in the first week on sale, the retailer is seeing “a quicker tail-off than historically experienced”.Game now expects cost savings to be higher, contributing to improved cash generation.Analysts at Investec said on the basis of the update, they expected a pre-tax loss of £15m in the current financial year, with the dividend pay-out now “under threat”.The shares closed down 46 per cent at 10¼p in London.
106;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-11-13T19:57:37Z;SAP resumes search for big acquisitions;;Jim Snabe, the co-chief executive of SAP, says the software company is looking for further, large acquisition opportunities, to build on its purchases of Business Objects and Sybase.“We’ve proven twice that we can buy big and be successful with that. With Business Objects, which we bought a couple of years ago, we came into the analytic space in a very strong way and we are now a clear market leader. Last year we acquired Sybase to bring the mobile technology to business software. So we can and we are also, of course, looking for such opportunities,” Mr Snabe told the Financial Times.But while he will not shy away from deals, Mr Snabe’s key focus is still innovating the company from within.“We can innovate faster than others can acquire. We have brought our innovation cycle down to six months, while a big transaction can take much longer than that, 12-18 months,” he said. It is an indirect allusion to Oracle, SAP’s US rival, which has made acquisition a central strategy, buying about 78 companies over the last six years.One of the most important innovations is making SAP’s technology more appealing to consumers. The software tends to be in the background of large corporations, running financial transactions, for example, or a human resources database. But few employees will realise they are using it. Mr Snabe wants them not just to notice – but to smile.“At Electronic Arts they have a rule that if they don’t see visible joy in a user in seven minutes a game will not sell. I would like to do the same with business software,” he told the Financial Times. “We are not quite there yet, but sometimes we do get visible joy, with people saying ‘this is really cool and I am going to show it to my children’,” he said.Last year, when Mr Snabe and Bill McDermott, his co-CEO, took charge of the company, they set a target of “touching 1bn people” with their software by 2015, putting the software into the hands of more employees at each customer company.It is crucial to do this, as the way that business software is bought is changing dramatically. In a move often referred to as the “consumerisation of IT”, employees are increasingly bringing their own technology to the workplace and expecting the same kind of ease of use from business software as they get from their Google webmail or their Apple iPad.If companies like SAP don’t adapt to these trends, they face being replaced by newer competitors.“Big enterprise software installations are very sticky – they represent decades of investment so companies don’t easily change them. But it is not a market that is growing very fast,” said Ross MacMillan, analyst at Jefferies. “Over time, if upstart vendors begin to offer inexpensive, cloud-based versions of software that address complex processes that SAP software addresses, the company could face a lot of risk.”“It is important for SAP to show that they are continuing to innovate, and adding to the platform that customers have installed. It will keep customers spending more money with them,” he said.Mr Snabe has borrowed ideas not just from EA, but a host of other companies.“We visited Porsche to learn lean, EA to learn user feedback, Cisco to learn how to breathe new ideas into the company, and Intel to learn about complex innovation processes,” Mr Snabe said.Internet and tablet companies are also clearly an inspiration. “We want to take the concept of Facebook and bring it to business,” he added.When Mr Snabe demonstrates some of SAP’s new products they all appear designed to work on an iPad screen. One, a team evaluation tool, allows pictures of employees to be plotted on a performance chart with the swipe of a finger. Another, a diagnostic tool for doctors, shows patient records in a Facebook-like format.One of the surprise hits for the company has been Hana, an in-memory processing technology that allows large amounts of information to be analysed extremely quickly. Customers such as supermarket groups are evaluating its use. It could, for example, be used for sending shoppers highly personalised coupons, straight to their mobile phones while they are browsing in the store.Hana was seen as very experimental last year, but now analysts like Mirko Maier, at Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, have been steadily raising their estimates for sales from the business, to €150m ($206m) for this year.“By 2013 Hana could account for 10 per cent of licence revenues, and even that could be conservative. It could be a meaningful revenue stream,” said Mr Maier.Other initiatives are going more slowly, however. Business by Design, SAP’s cloud computing offering, was launched late and is growing slowly. SAP aims to have 1,000 customers for the unit by the end of the year, but is currently up to just 650.Overall, investors seems satisfied with a recent run of positive results, and the share price has moved up nearly 17 per cent over the past year. But with European markets facing crisis, it is unclear if the transformation is enough.“The question is how much do these incremental businesses drive growth?,” Mr MacMillan said. “Fifty or 60 per cent of the company is still the core business which will slow in a downturn.”
107;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;‘Call of Duty MW3’ takes $400m on first day;;Activision Blizzard’s Call of Duty franchise has again broken its own record for the “biggest entertainment launch” to date, with the latest instalment of the war-game franchise ringing up $400m (£250m) in first-day sales.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, the PC and console game released on Tuesday, sold 6.5m units in North America and the UK within 24 hours. That means Activision outstripped Electronic Arts’ rival title, Battlefield 3, which sold 5m copies in its first week upon release last month, making it the publisher’s fastest-selling game.Console games typically retail for several times more than a cinema ticket, complicating comparisons, but Activision says the sales figures make it the only entertainment franchise to set a new record three years in succession.In 2009, Modern Warfare 2 posted first-day sales of $310m and last year, Call of Duty: Black Ops sold $360m.The milestone demonstrates how blockbuster video game debuts are becoming more like Hollywood film premieres, complete with a star-studded launch party at London’s Old Billingsgate market, attended by footballers and musicians.“We believe the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is the biggest entertainment launch of all time in any medium, and we achieved this record with sales from only two territories,” said Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, which is largely owned by Vivendi.“Other than Call of Duty, there has never been another entertainment franchise that has set opening day records three years in a row. Life-to-date sales for the Call of Duty franchise exceed worldwide theatrical box office for Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, two of the most successful entertainment franchises of all time.”Activision upped its 2011 forecasts earlier this week as Modern Warfare 3 went on sale. Analysts had predicted it would at least match the 25m total sales of Black Ops.However, Activision is grappling with falling subscriptions at another large franchise, the online subscription game World of Warcraft.
108;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Index Ventures raises €500m tech fund;;Index Ventures, one of Europe’s leading technology investors, has raised a €500m fund, the biggest new pot of cash for internet innovators in the region for five years.Index, which has offices in London, Geneva and San Francisco, made its first investment from the new fund last month with Dropbox, the online storage provider which was valued at $4bn.This is its second late-stage fund, and will be targeted at technology companies that are growing fast but with substantial revenues, typically investing between €10m and €50m.Previously known for backing Skype, the internet telephony service, and Playfish, the online gaming firm sold to Electronic Arts for $400m, Index has made 15 exits from its portfolio in the past 12 months.These include Lovefilm, the DVD and digital movie rental service bought by Amazon.com for £200m in January, and the London flotation of Betfair, the online betting exchange.Companies in Index’s original €400m growth fund, raised in 2007, grew sales at an average of 70 per cent last year, with many generating revenues over €100m per annum. However Index declined to give any indicator of the fund’s overall financial performance.“The focus is on companies who are already proved as a business, who have a lot of headroom in the business model to grow over the next three to five years, and particularly on companies that grow internationally in the European market and into the US,” said Giuseppe Zocco, partner and co-founder of Index.“Typically these companies are already proved emerging leaders …we help them to grow internationally and sustain their rapid growth rates.”Index will continue to invest in seed, early-stage and more mature companies in the internet and software sectors, with a particular focus on investment themes including marketplaces, eCommerce, mobile and payments.The new fund will provide a much-needed boost to European technology entrepreneurs, after a 12 per cent drop in venture investments in the third quarter of 2011, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.It will be the largest European-focused growth fund in five years, according to Preqin, an industry research group. Balderton Capital raised $500m in 2009 and Accel Partners’ London outpost raised $525m in 2008. Last year Atomico Ventures, the fund led by Skype’s founders Niklas Zennström and Janus Friis, raised $165m.Index said it was drawing on contributions from both new and existing “limited partners”, which include funds of funds, endowments, foundations and other institutional investors.Earlier this week, France Telecom and Publicis Groupe announced a €150m fund, largely for French and European digital entrepreneurs, with the ambition that external investors would match their investment.
109;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-10-12T00:22:26Z;Zynga release titles as IPO hopes stagnate;;Zynga, the leading social gaming publisher, has unveiled a slate of new titles in the face of a stalled IPO process, stagnating user numbers and increasing competition from traditional publishers.The San Francisco-based company also gave a glimpse of a new web home under construction for its games, called Project Z, which could reduce its dependency on Facebook, the social network that takes a 30 per cent cut of sales made on its site.Zynga, named after founder Mark Pincus’s bulldog, presented its new games at its “Doghouse” headquarters, with CastleVille garnering the most attention. Zynga has made its name and fortune with its “Ville” series of games – CastleVille will be the fourth, following FarmVille, FrontierVille and CityVille.“We have over 232m monthly active players and over 60m daily active players and they play over 2bn minutes each and every day,” said John Schappert, Zynga’s chief operating officer.But analysts point out that Zynga’s user levels are the same as those first reached nearly two years ago, despite four titles being released since June.While CityVille remains the top game on Facebook with 75m monthly average users, Electronic Arts’ The Sims Social has 67m and has added 42m users in the past month, according to figures from AppData.com.“When they launch new games, they are very clearly cannibalising their old games, so they have a real issue of figuring out how to grow their user base,” says Doug Creutz, video game analyst at Cowen and Company.He says Zynga is a great analytics company in working out how to make money from its players, but not necessarily a great creative game company. “I think people are catching up to them on the analytics side and there are others that have better game development DNA – and that’s hurting Zynga.”Mr Pincus said Zynga knew it was still at a “primitive” stage and promised its games would “come to life so much more” in the next two years, including higher quality graphics similar to those of Activision Blizzard’s World of Warcraft hit.CastleVille, “coming soon to Facebook”, is developed by a Texan games studio experienced in high quality PC games and will feature an original soundtrack recorded with a 75-piece orchestra and full choir, a first for a social game.The company also showed off the highly detailed Hidden Chronicles, a recycling of PC mystery and discovery games where players have to find hidden objects, but did not explain how it would earn revenues from this new social genre.Zynga filed to go public on July 1. Its board valued the company at $14bn in August but reduced its expectations for an IPO, blaming market volatility.
110;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-09-29T19:08:36Z;Facebook in smartphone apps move;;Facebook is in the advanced stages of developing mobile applications that will for the first time bring games and other apps that work on its web platform to smartphones.The move is likely to cause controversy for Apple as Facebook’s “apps within an app” model could break Apple’s rules for software on its iPhone and iPad.Facebook is expected to release apps for Apple products and Google’s Android smartphones next month, according to people familiar with its plans.Third-party apps will run inside a “wrapper” within Facebook’s “native” app and updates from friends using them will be incorporated into a mobile version of its new live “ticker”.Screenshots from guidelines for “social mobile web app” developers emerged on the TechCrunch website on Thursday after being accidentally published by Facebook. It reported that the launch could come as soon as next week. However, one developer told the Financial Times the timescale was “fluid”, depending on the readiness of app developers and discussions with Apple.Facebook and Apple declined to comment.Games such as Zynga’s Cityville and EA’s The Sims Social are among the most popular third-party apps on Facebook, played by tens of millions of people a day.But their absence from Facebook’s mobile apps diminishes the social network’s appeal for new users in emerging markets who use it primarily on phones.Some Facebook executives expect the majority of its members will be mobile users within two years, although its iPhone app has been criticised by users recently for unreliability. Facebook’s new mobile platform will allow developers of games and other apps to use HTML5 – an evolution of the language in which websites are written – to replicate apps on different platforms and avoid Apple’s lengthy approval process when making changes.In social gaming, updates are made several times a week – impossible under Apple’s regime.Facebook is considering whether to allow use of its virtual currency, Credits, to enable the buying of items within games. Apple bans in-app purchasing that does not go via its own payments system and it takes a 30 per cent cut of all transactions through its App Store.Facebook’s app is the most popular in iPhone’s four-year history, giving the social network leverage that could allow for special dispensation from Apple.But such an exemption would open up Apple to criticism from other developers using its App Store.It has been reported that Facebook could join Apple at its iPhone launch next week to unveil the social network’s long-awaited iPad app. But the two companies’ relationship has been rocky in the past, especially around Apple’s decision to incorporate Twitter, a Facebook rival, into the next version of its operating system.
111;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-08-22T09:54:40Z;Apple said to scrap UDIDs in iOS5;;Tech news from around the web:Apple is to phase out access to the unique device identifier, or UDID, on devices such as iPhones and iPads in the next update to its iOS mobile software, according to TechCrunch. The UDID is used by mobile ad and game networks or any app that needs to identify its users. If it is scrapped, companies would have to create their own unique identifiers to keep track of their users. This, TechCrunch warns, would mean companies may well have to get rid of all of their historical user data and start from scratch.Skype has agreed to acquire GroupMe, a US group messaging start-up, the Wall Street journal reports. GroupMe’s application lets users text and make conference calls with circles of friends or colleagues on their smartphones. The company was purchased for around $80m, a person familiar with the deal told the WSJ.Zynga has appointed another executive from Electronic Arts, TechCrunch reports. The social gaming group has appointed former EA executive vice-president Jeff Karp to the new post of chief marketing and revenue officer.From the FT:Beyond Oblivion reveals its Boinc music serviceHP directors defend shift in strategyWalmart’s online movies overtake Amazon
112;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-07-30T16:00:17Z;Story of the week: Mobile gaming;;“Can I play a game on it?” Any parent with a smartphone or tablet has heard his or her child ask this. With all that mobile devices are capable of doing, smartphones and tablets are also driving the rise in mobile gaming.This week, new research revealed growing revenue in mobile gaming. The shift in consumer behaviour has had a negative impact on console maker Nintendo, which cut its profit outlook for the year.During its earnings call investors, Nintendo announced that it would lower the cost of its 3DS handheld game console by up to 40 per cent – just four months after its launch, the FT reported.Traditional console makers, such as Nintendo, are “facing difficult challenges as consumers increasingly choose to play games on general-purpose devices such as smartphones and tablet computers”.Game developers have noticed the move to mobile gaming as well. During a shareholders meeting for Electronic Arts, CEO John Riccitello said that consumers are not interested in 3D gaming, Dvice reported.In an interview with Industry Gamers, Riccitello stressed the iPad is the “fastest growing platform”. He added that consoles “currently account for 40 percent of the games industry,” Tom’s Guide wrote.As more tablets are expected to be released and older versions to be refreshed, increases in processing power could move more gamers away from consoles. International Business Times wrote that “with more hardware improvements tablets are fast becoming beasts which can take on consoles in the future.”A number of analysts at ABI Research predicted that online mobile gaming revenues will hit $16 billion in 2015, up from $5 billion in 2011, said The Credit Union Times. The research findings also noted the “increasing consumer willingness to spend real money on so-called virtual goods” as a share of mobile gaming revenue.Even search giants want a slice of the market as rumours spread that Google and its latest social networking endeavor, Google+, will add gaming to its services. Patrick Miller of PCWorld asked the executive producer of Rocket Ninja and CEO of Kabam to share their thoughts about the gaming potential of Google+ and “both noted that Circles could add a lot to future social games”.
113;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;EA sees 10x interest in Battlefield 3;;A bit of a shooting match is shaping up in the video game business for later this year as Electronic Arts continues to sound bullish about Battlefield 3, a title that will take on Activision Blizzard’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 during the holiday season.EA said during its earnings announcement on Tuesday that preorders for the title were 10 times that of its predecessor, Battlefield Bad Company 2, which has sold more than 9m units to date.EA is not going as far as saying it can beat Activision’s record-breaking franchise this year, but it hopes to get a bigger piece of the first-person shooter genre.“They are an entrenched competitor with a disproportionate share of the market,” said Eric Brown, EA chief financial officer, in an FT interview.“Our objective is to increase unit sales over Battlefield Bad Company 2, because if we do that, we will be increasing our market share.”EA’s title is being launched two weeks before the November 8 debut of the latest Call of Duty, which should at least give it a head start.With only four titles released in its June quarter, compared to six a year earlier, EA reported lighter revenues of $524m, down from $539m the previous year. Losses increased to 37 cents a share from 24 cents.EA emphasised growth in its digital revenues in its first fiscal quarter and increased its guidance for the fiscal year to $1.1bn-$1.15bn, due to the acquisition of PopCap Games for up to $1.35bn, announced two weeks ago. Mr Brown said he expected the deal to be completed next month on schedule.
114;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-07-15T19:19:44Z;Freedom from the same old narrative;In an age of interactive stories, television remains devoted to traditional dramatic structures;"Although online viewing has changed the way we watch television, freeing us from the tyranny of the schedule and the hassle of recording, digital possibilities have had little effect on the viewing experience itself. Television continues to be the one form of small-screen entertainment conducted entirely on the makers’ terms. Everywhere else, control is being passed to the viewers – or, as is more often the case, players.Take literary adaptation. The video game Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, released this week (Electronic Arts), transposes a novel, with the author’s ending fixed in print, into a medium defined by its possibilities and permutations. The game borrows JK Rowling’s basic narrative co-ordinates but allows the player’s prowess – or otherwise – to determine the rest. But this type of adaptation-as-appropriation is well established, and Simon Meek, of the Scottish company TernTV, has offered a glimpse of things to come.TernTV has started work on “digital adaptations”, which place the reader inside the settings of a novel – the prototype, The 39 Steps, will be released next spring (www.digital-adaptations.com). Meek is irritated by the claim that the e-book brings reading into the digital age. On the contrary, he argues, it merely digitises the bound codex. The means of reception is barely changed, the mode of production not at all. Those “playing through” his adaptations won’t be able to alter the written story, but their experience of the story will be much freer and more fluent than the engagement offered by literature, film or television. (He says that his digital adaptations will resort to using text only “when words are best placed to tell the story”.)As things stand, digital television is to television what the e-book is to the book ­– an updated means of engaging in the same old way. In an age of interactive stories, such as those offered by digital fiction company Failbetter Games (www.failbettergames.com), television remains devoted to traditional narrative-dramatic modes and maker-viewer dynamics. The choices programme makers face about structure and story-telling have barely changed since the birth of the medium.In distinguishing his approach to adaptation, Meek says there will be “elements of choice”. The player may “want to speed through”, or “read around the edges”: a 200-page book might take four hours to “experience”; it could take six. BBC2’s version of Sarah Waters’s novel The Night Watch (Tuesday) was an analogue adaptation stuck in the bad old days of fixed duration and viewer enslavement. For those of us still open to the values and pleasures of analogue fiction, this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. It was for entirely different reasons that the programme fell flat.The approach was what Meek would call speed-through. Writer Paula Milne and director Richard Laxton compressed the novel’s 470 pages into a single 90-minute episode, continuing the BBC’s downsizing of Waters adaptations – Tipping the Velvet was three episodes, Fingersmith two. Waters’s tale of homosexuality and adultery moves backwards, starting in 1947 and ending in 1941, with a central chunk set in 1944, so the novel lends itself to a three-part serial. Adapting it as a feature-length one-off meant that the consequences for the characters, including a nervous ex-con (Harry Treadaway) and a former ambulance volunteer who haunts the grey streets of post-war London (Anna Maxwell Martin), hadn’t been well established before we were invited to care about their causes, also insufficiently explored.The makers of The Kennedys, which ended this week (BBC2 Fridays), were confronted with a different challenge – structuring the true story of a famous American family as seven 40-minute episodes. They decided that the biography of a dynasty should come to an end with the assassination of Bobby (Barry Pepper), the episode having begun with the funeral of his older brother (Greg Kinnear). Of course, this was an arbitrary pause rather than a natural conclusion: history doesn’t come in episodes. But we should be grateful that we were spared any more of this tacky and lugubrious soap opera.Rageh Omaar, in what he has called a “groundbreaking” new series (Mondays, BBC2), has set himself the task of telling The Life of Muhammad in three one-hour instalments. Groundbreaking in subject, perhaps, but not in approach.It was decided at some point that an hour makes sense as a unit of viewing, especially for documentaries, but as this form almost always involves a wandering presenter, an over-pronounced voiceover and some talking heads, most viewers lose interest after about 35 minutes. However fascinating the story, the formula is in need of refreshing.Channel 4 is making an effort to exhibit the work of new documentary film-makers in its series Coming Up (Mondays). The first episode, Double Lesson, took the form of an intense monologue, with the details taken from real cases, but delivered by the actor Philip Davies, playing a put-upon history teacher.Simon Meek would probably consider the whole thing hopelessly 20th century, but the docudrama is the least exhausted of television formats, and this turned out to a judicious and well-sustained 25 minutes.small.screen@ft.com"
115;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-07-13T21:40:59Z;Energy and materials lead US stocks higher;;Energy and materials led US stocks to gains across the board as US equity indices ended a three-session slide.US stocks initially climbed as traders were cheered by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke discussing future policy options before Congress and saying that the US Federal Reserve was “ready to respond” if a further stimulus was needed to revamp the sluggish US economy. Yet they came off their session highs after a top Fed official opposed Mr Bernanke’s comments saying he was against providing a stimulus even if the economy worsens.Stocks lost further ground after John Boehner, house speaker, said there would be no guarantee that the debt limit would be raised if an agreement was not inked by early August.The benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.31 per cent at 1,317.6 and the Nasdaq Composite was also in positive territory, up 0.54 per cent at 2,796.92.Most of the S&P sectors were up, with the materials sector 0.8 per cent higher with Titanium Metals at the helm, up 7 per cent at $18.9. The energy sector was up 0.7 per cent – spurred on in part by a decline in oil inventories, led by Alpha Natural, the coal producer, up 3.7 per cent at $45.The Dow Jones Industrial average climbed 0.4 per cent to 12,491.61, led by Caterpillar, which was up 1.6 per cent at $108.60.Financials weakened, but JPMorgan Chaseclosed 0.6 per cent up at $39.62, ending a three-session losing streak. However, poised for a lacklustre report of earnings before the bell on Thursday, it may say second-quarter revenue declined 0.8 per cent to $24.9bn according to average estimates by analysts.“The next big thing coming is JPMorgan releasing results, and that will fuel the fire,” said Sam Ginzburg, head of capital markets at First New York Securities.Investment Technology Group, an agency brokerage that serves large institutions, was down 13.73 per cent to $11.80, after the announcement of a large write-off for the second quarter alongside layoffs. As one of the lowest performing sectors, financials are under pressure to show that they can increase revenue within the sluggish US economy.Capital One slid 2.6 per cent to $50.87 despite reporting better than expected quarterly profits. It also said it would raise $2bn through a stock offering to finance the acquisition of ING’s US online bank.“Credit cards seem set for another quarter of beat and raise. Estimates are likely to move higher for Capital One. We continue to recommend Capital One and would note over the past year or so the card improvement cycle has survived several rounds of macro issues including the first round of Europe, the first GDP slowdown, and an oil price shock,” said Brian Foran, an analyst with Nomura.Other financial companies on the S&P 500 will announce earnings this week, including Citigroup on Friday.Marriott, the hotel chain, saw gains of 0.9 per cent at $37.10 while Yum! Brands, the US fast food restaurant group, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, closed up 1.09 per cent at $55.60. Yum reported a 10 per cent gain in profits or $0.65 per share in the second quarter, beating analysts’ expectations. Marriott’s diluted earnings per share totalled $0.37, a 19 per cent increase over the same period last year. Both companies announced results after the closing bell on Wednesday.“Yum! Brands has cash flow, strong, predictable and sustainable earnings. It has global reach with 40 per cent of its profits coming from China, which contributed to great earnings over time,” said Tucker Brown, research principal with SGA.On the media front, Netflix, the DVD subscription and streaming video company, hit an all-time high of $304.80 in early trading, though it pared its gains to $298.70, up 2.6 per cent. The company signed a multi-year deal renewing and broadening its rights to films and television shows from NBC Universal. This Tuesday’s move to overhaul its pricing policy to reflect the relative costs of distributing movies via the net and the post, was imed at pushing users toward its growing streaming service.News Corp was still in focus after dropping its $12.5bn bid to take full control of BSkyB, though it said it would remain as a long-term shareholder. Also on Wednesday, Senator Jay Rockefeller called for an inquiry into the media group , the first indication that the phone-hacking scandal that sparked outrage in the UK could spill over to the US. Its shares closed up 3.8 per cent to $15.93 in New York, paring back some losses after experiencing a 12.1 per cent drop since last week.
116;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-07-13T00:35:31Z;EA extends digital push with PopCap deal;;Electronic Arts is paying up to $1.35bn for PopCap Games, the maker of Plants vs Zombies, as the console-based publisher expands into the faster-growing casual gaming sector.The deal to buy PopCap follows its acquisition of Chillingo, publisher of the Angry Birds game, for about $20m last October and a $400m deal to buy social gaming company Playfish in 2009.EA, the largest video game publisher by revenues after Activision Blizzard, has been placing more emphasis on digital revenues as opposed to its traditional “packaged goods” business of discs for console games.“PopCap’s great studio talent and powerful [intellectual property] add to EA’s momentum and accelerate our drive towards a $1bn digital business,” said John Riccitiello, EA chief executive.Compared with rivals such as four-year-old Zynga, Seattle-based PopCap is a veteran independent developer of casual games.Founded in 2000, it employs 475 people and has become a hit factory led by the success of Bejeweled, a puzzle game in which the objective is to form chains of gems, which has sold more than 50m units.Follow-up successes have included Peggle, Bookworm, Zuma and its latest casual gaming blockbuster Plants vs Zombies, in which vegetation fights stumbling hordes of possessed creatures.“We picked EA because they have recast their culture around making great digital games,” said David Roberts, chief executive of PopCap.“By working with EA, we’ll scale our games and services to deliver more social, mobile, casual fun to an even bigger, global audience.”More than 80 per cent of PopCap’s sales are on digital platforms, including Facebook, the iPhone and Android smartphones.EA hopes PopCap will help it expand its business on these platforms as well as into new ones such as smart televisions and new regions such as Asia.Social and mobile game revenues are expected to grow 32 per cent and 24 per cent a year respectively between 2010 and 2014, while console game sales are expected to fall by 2 per cent a year, according to forecasts by analysts at Think Equity.The Silicon Valley company is paying $650m in cash and $100m in EA stock to the founders and chief executive of PopCap, while offering up to $50m in stock to retain management in the next four years, and up to $550m in cash for achieving earnings targets.EA shares, which are up nearly 50 per cent this year, fell by 3.5 per cent to $23.34 in extended trading on the news.The company also announced preliminary results for its quarter ending June 30, with sales between $500m and $525m ahead of previous guidance of between $460m and $500m.
117;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-07-01T23:22:28Z;Zynga’s small beginnings to empire building;;Building and defending empires is the subject of Zynga’s latest hit title. It is also something founder and chief executive Mark Pincus is achieving in his real life in the booming social gaming industry.A playful character himself, Mr Pincus wrote a “Dear potential Zynga shareholders” letter in the company’s filing for an initial public offering on Friday, imitating the practice of Andrew Mason, Groupon chief executive, in the online coupon company’s recent filing and Larry Page, Google’s co-founder, when it went public.Like Google, he stressed a long-term strategy, saying that the share offering allowed it “to invest more in play than any company in history”.He pledged: “We will make decisions and trade-offs that are different from other companies. We will prioritise innovation and long-term growth over quarterly earnings.”That strategy will be harder to pursue in public, once the company is under more intense scrutiny, than it has been in private, but it has served Mr Pincus well so far.“He’s on a mission to build the biggest game company ever built and the best game company ever built,” says Marc Andreessen, a Zynga investor.The entrepreneur founded Zynga in 2007, naming it after his late American bulldog, and it has grown to 2,000 staff over the past four and a half years.Although the start-up may be viewed as riding on the back of Facebook’s success and its 700m users, many have ridden this tiger yet none has succeeded to the extent Zynga has.Zynga has 280m monthly players of its Facebook games, according to AppData, more than eight times those of its nearest rivals – Europe’s Wooga and Electronic Arts, which bought Zy.It is valued at $15.4bn, according to the SharesPost private exchange, making it worth more than Activision Blizzard, the biggest traditional games company, with hits such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft spanning consoles and PCs.Zynga’s success is more narrowly based, with CityVille attracting 88m players a month as the leading social game on Facebook, and its newest hit Empires & Allies, launched last month, acquiring 45m players.The games are more simple than console ones, with activities such as building houses and communities and growing crops. The maintenance involved and regular rewards make them addictive, leading to purchases of virtual goods, such as tractors and mansions, to enhance the experience.Zynga has been adept at analysing players’ behaviour and tweaking content and gameplay accordingly.“Zynga should not just be viewed as a gaming company, but one that can engineer behaviour through a systematic process of gathering data and using that to refine its games. It’s not just about designing cute figures and a cute storyline,” says Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner research.However, analysts fear producing formulaic games will wear thin. There has been some “cannibalisation” as FarmVille users moved to CityVille, and “churn” as users stopped playing Empires & Allies, perhaps turned off by the new combat element. Being so dependent on Facebook limits Zynga – Facebook has no access to the Chinese market, for example, which has a huge interest in gaming.Additional reporting by Richard Waters and April Dembosky
118;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-05-31T17:21:36Z;News Briefs;;Week beginning August 22
119;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-05-19T22:00:33Z;Celebrity chef cooks up social game;;It was only a matter of time before celebrities sought to extend their personal brands established on Twitter and Facebook to other social arenas such as games, which are capturing as much attention as the stars themselves.Zynga has been featuring music from Lady Gaga’s latest album inside FarmVille this month in a deal with the singer and now Electronic Arts has announced celebrity chef Jamie Oliver will feature in its own Facebook game, Restaurant City.Restaurant City, developed by its Playfish acquisition, has more than 5m monthly average users and some 60m virtual restaurants have been built inside the game.For the next four weeks, players will collect the ingredients for a Jamie Oliver recipe, beginning with Farfalle Carbonara, receiving an exclusive in-game item of a Jamie Oliver Pasta Maker along the way.Once the dish is created virtually, they will receive a link to the real recipe on the British chef’s website.“I’m really excited that some of my recipes are becoming part of Restaurant City as it’s such a phenomenon, I’m always interested in new social media,” said the chef, who has more than 1m followers on Twitter.As well as being packed with nutritious ingredients, the deal is mutually beneficial – Mr Oliver will be able to draw attention to his new Food Revolution TV series and EA will hope to attract new players, drawn by his celebrity to a game that has slipped outside the Top 50 and has less than half the players of Zynga’s rival Café World.
120;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-05-16T19:53:21Z;EA chief tells how to “fail well”;;While commencement speeches typically focus on the opportunities and successes that lie ahead in life, John Riccitiello, chief executive of Electronic Arts, challenged the norm today and delivered one to graduates on how to fail well.Visiting his alma mater, the Haas School of Business at the University of California Berkeley, Mr Riccitiello talked about difficulties in his four years as CEO at EA, while citing similar dark times for others who went on to be tech industry titans.After describing the travails of Steve Jobs at Apple in the late 90s and John Chambers at Wang before he led Cisco Systems to success, he recounted how EA had gone from being by far the most successful video game publisher to one that struggled to handle the switch to current-generation consoles that began at the end of 2005.When Larry Probst announced Mr Riccitiello as his replacement in February 2007, the CEO of 16 years said the most difficult period had been navigated and good times were ahead, while Mr Riccitiello said he would be joining “an extremely well-run company”.But, in his commencement address, Mr Riccitiello said product quality had dropped by 2007-2008, development costs were soaring, profits had gone into decline and were turning into losses.“Four years ago, I held a meeting and told employees we were in a do-or-die situation,” he said.“We were failing. We could invest and retool for radical change or we could accept a shrinking share of a shrinking pie…and eventually die.”His proposal was to improve game quality and move into new markets and platforms – digital, smartphones, social gaming – while dramatically cutting costs.“Perhaps most painfully, we had to do these three hard things while the press and many financial analysts told us we were crazy – that the cutting we were doing was great, but that the investment in digital was just not a good idea.“I lost a few friends in this process – smart, creative people who just couldn’t stomach the transition. Some stopped believing. Some left for what they thought were better offers with a quicker payout. But I’m surprised and heartened by how many have stayed.”The eventual payoff has been that EA’s game quality has improved, costs are down and digital revenues rose 46 per cent to $833m in the just-reported fiscal year. Profits of 70 cents a share compare to a loss of 30 cents two years earlier. EA shares have risen by a third over the past year, but are still down 54 per cent compared to April 2 2007 – the day he took over from Mr Probst.Analysts are still critical of EA’s high levels of share-related compensation and costs of restructuring, while its digital revenues and its margins on them do not come close to those of Activision, which overtook EA as the largest publisher when it merged with Vivendi’s games division in July 2008.Mr Riccitiello said there was still much to do, but: “I would argue we failed well. We were students of our own failure. We used our failure to shape and impel us to a better strategy.”“Trust me, sooner or later you’re going to get knocked on your ass,” he said in closing.“Will you fold or will you fail well?”The EA chief told me in an interview beforehand that, with more than 20 nephews and nieces, he had gotten used to seeing them graduate to commencement speeches that told them life was glorious and they would be running everything that matters within a few years.He thought none of these addresses were memorable, but telling students to fail well might be something they would remember and find useful.“There is a chance that no one will applaud at the end and they’ll say that bastard ruined my last day, but I’m hoping that’s not what they remember,” he said.
121;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;EA predicts digital sales to surpass $1bn;;Electronic Arts predicted digital sales would surpass $1bn in its current fiscal year in a riposte to the threat from social and mobile gaming companies such as Zynga.The venerable video game publisher has been irked by comparisons with Zynga in recent months – funding rounds had given the four-year-old start-up a valuation in excess of $6bn, surpassing EA’s market capitalisation.In fourth-quarter and full-year earnings announced on Wednesday, EA said digital revenues of $833m, which included mobile and social gaming, exceeded its target of $750m and were up 46 per cent on the previous year. The Fifa soccer franchise generated more than $100m in digital sales.“We’re working very hard to increase our mix of digital revenues – it was 20 to 30 per cent of revenues in the fourth quarter alone,” said Eric Brown, chief financial officer, in a Financial Times interview. He added that the figure would be taken past $1bn in the current fiscal year.EA’s traditional strength has been in “packaged goods” – the discs sold at retail for console and PC games – but it has made a big bet on digital expansion and developing sales of all forms of online content.The San Francisco Bay Area company suffered the blow of John Schappert, its chief operating officer, leaving last month to join near neighbour Zynga, which has built its paper fortune with games on the Facebook social network.But EA’s shares have been on the rise– up 25 per cent over the past six months providing a market cap of $6.65bn. They rose another 3 per cent to $20.50 in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company reported profits and revenues ahead of expectations.“We’re starting to hit our stride, this is five quarters in a row that we’ve exceeded Wall Street’s consensus,” said Mr Brown.EA reported fourth-quarter revenues of $995m for profits of 25 cents a share, ahead of analyst expectations of $924m in revenues and earnings of 22 cents a share.For the current fiscal year, it predicted revenues of about $3.85bn, shy of consensus forecasts of $3.9bn, while earnings of about 80 cents a share were below expectations of 86 cents.Revenues could be hit by the delay announced on Wednesday for the latest title in the popular Mass Effect series. Mass Effect 3, due before the end of the calendar year, will not now appear until early next year, EA said.
122;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-03-10T20:37:46Z;BofA under fire over staff home-loss subsidies;;The Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered Bank of America to include a proposal in its proxy statement that calls for eliminating a form of compensation that protects executives from falling house prices when they relocate.Bank of America is not the only company to come under fire for protecting executives against a downturn in the housing market during one of the worst real estate slumps in recent history. But according to the shareholder group that is trying to get the policy repealed, the bank has been one of the more recalcitrant.“Bank of America just dug in their heels,” said Rosanna Weaver of CtW Group, which works with pensions funds that have a combined total of 5.5m members.According to Ms Weaver, the bank attempted to block the proposal from inclusion in its proxy by arguing that allowing shareholders to vote on home-loss subsidies would be no different than allowing them to vote on laptop or BlackBerry policies. The SEC disagreed and ruled this week that the proposal “focused on a significant policy issue of senior executive compensation.”BofA said such compensation practices do not pertain to any executives mentioned in its 2010 proxy, which is scheduled to be released soon.Ms. Weaver said CtW had also approached Microsoft about reducing the home-loss subsidies offered to executives. “Microsoft was much more responsive,” Ms Weaver said. Microsoft has since introduced caps on some relocation benefits and extended the period in which it can “claw back” this type of compensation to two years.Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory company, has also been critical of companies that offer relocation subsidies, including Microsoft, Walmart and Electronic Arts, the video game maker. The group last year urged investors to oppose the re-election of directors who oversaw the pay-outs of home-loss subsidies.At BofA, Barbara Desoer was offered such a package when she relocated from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Calabasas, California, in 2008, to head the bank’s home loans and insurance division. Ms Desoer was given $2.6m to cover relocation costs, including a mortgage subsidy, closing fees and tax liabilities, according to the bank’s 2009 proxy. In the event, her old home, which was bought by an independent relocation company, was resold for a loss, BofA, according to the proxy, will bear those costs, not Ms Desoer.While it is unclear what happened to Ms Desoer’s house, the market in Charlotte has not fared well. According to CoreLogic, a real estate tracking firm, home prices in Charlotte declined nearly 4 per cent in January, compared with the year earlier period. That follows a nearly 5 per cent decrease in December.
123;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-02-19T00:44:44Z;Dead Space 2’s mass effect;;It was “Klingons on the starboard bow” time in video games in January, with the space genre dominating.Eve Online introduced a major update to its online universe, Electronic Arts released Mass Effect 2 on the PlayStation 3 and launched Dead Space 2,which sold 440,000 units in the US, according to monthly figures released by the NPD research firm on Thursday.Dead Space‘s figures were achieved with less than a week in the market – it went on sale in the US on Jan 25 and in Europe on Jan 28, where it is topping the charts in the UK. It was third for the month of January in the US, behind Call of Duty: Black Ops and Ubisoft’s Just Dance for the Wii.Doug Creutz, video game analyst at Cowen and Company, said in a Friday note that Dead Space 2 was on course to sell 2m units worldwide this year, which seems a conservative estimate.“From what we can tell, Dead Space 2 is outselling Dead Space 1 by a ratio of 2 to 1,” Eric Brown, EA’s chief financial officer, told me on a recent call.I was impressed at how EA not only released the game on the PS3, Xbox 360 and PC at the same time, but also had iPod touch, iPhone and iPad games ready as well to whet our appetites for the bigger game.I enjoyed the outstanding sound and graphics on the iPod touch version as well as the graphic gameplay.EA has also been creative with its marketing campaign, subjecting 200 mums to its violent scenes and recording their reactions for its “Your Mom Hates Dead Space 2” campaign.With Mass Effect 2 for the PS3, EA is introducing the franchise to the platform for the first time. The developer BioWare has tackled the lack of a prequel for PS3 players with the simultaneous release on the PlayStation Network of a free comic-book-style catch-up for them called Mass Effect Genesis.Mass Effect 2, where players take the role of Commander Shepard leading a crew of operatives on a potentially suicidal mission across the galaxy, was the winner of Game of the Year at last week’s Interactive Achievement Awards.In Eve Online, its Icelandic developers introduced more improvements to the Incursion expansion of its universe this week, following a major upgrade in January, when a new character creator was introduced.I was given an impressive demonstration in January of how characters can be created in a more natural and definable sculpting process, rather than the traditional sliders that adjust the size of a face or nose.The new expansion encourages players to group together to fight an artificial-intelligence element – Sansha Kuvakei and his zombie forces – that has been introduced to attack different parts of the occupied galaxy.Eve currently has around 350,000 players on a single shard – meaning everyone participates in the same universe or server cluster.
124;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-02-03T12:08:43Z;Interview: ‘We are driven to do the right thing’;;"Paul Walsh has experienced financial services from both sides of the commercial divide – in mutual country and in what he calls “plc land”.He says the important difference between the banks and mutually owned organisations, such as building societies, is the emphasis on customer focus. “We are about creating sustainable, rather than opportunistic, profits,” says Mr Walsh, chief executive of Cuna Mutual Group Europe, and previously commercial director for insurance at Barclays.He says “traditional plcs” are instead driven by quarterly results and the need to “say how well they have done”. The contrast is that: “We are driven to do the right thing for the client and over the long curve.”Cuna, which Mr Walsh joined in 2007, is part of a global mutual with a turnover of $13bn (£8.36bn) providing services such as underwriting insurance policies to other mutuals. It has 5,000 employees, 56 in Europe.It seeks to attract bright, talented candidates – and there is also a contrast between its recruitment practices and other financial institutions. Whereas the “plc” might seek employees with mathematical talents, Cuna values a computer or life sciences background just as highly. “I’m as likely to be competing with Electronic Arts (the games maker) as with a bank when I’m recruiting a computer person,” laughs Mr Walsh.Mutuals were seen as lagging behind banks on technology, but Mr Walsh says the segment has now leapfrogged its rivals, thanks to customer demand for products to be delivered more quickly, whether it is a mortgage or life assurance application.As Mr Walsh points out, it took an hour or more in 2005 to apply for a mortgage in a branch; life assurance policies in branches could take up to 25 minutes. Now, he says: “People want to buy their product online in under eight minutes and if they can’t do it they’re on to the next guy.”Cuna’s technology lets customers apply online quickly and with simple explanations, which makes it very interested in finding people with skills in delivering online sales and marketing strategies.Similarly, recruits with backgrounds in maths or life sciences could find themselves working on actuarial and risk aspects of underwriting insurance policies in a specific UK region, tailoring the products to the needs of Cuna’s partners and the local purchasers of the products in branches, online and by phone.Determining the health, wealth and longevity of possible customers is an important part of what some future recruits are likely to do. “Everyone asks purchasers of policies how much they drink, or smoke,” Mr Walsh says. “But we realised there is more to it. So if you understand more about the underlying trends in health, lifestyle and education regionally you can offer a more effective product in a more sustainable way.” Here a life sciences background could be as important as maths.Those hired are likely to find themselves quickly gaining responsibility – developing products, testing them with customers, and finding ways of marketing and delivering them. Exceptional talents can make it into a management position in two years, Mr Walsh says.As it is, the hiring and retention of top talent is likely to be one of Mr Walsh’s main concerns. “We want good people, but it is the brightest people we are competing for.”"
125;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-02-02T22:03:31Z;Mixed earnings weigh on Wall Street;;Wall Street slipped slightly after a mixed batch of earnings reports, but indices stayed close to the 28-month highs reached in the previous session.Whirlpool, the world’s largest appliance maker, reported that its fourth-quarter earnings had missed forecasts, sending shares down 2.1 per cent to $83.60. The company re-ported earnings of $171m or $2.19 a share, falling short of consensus forecasts of $2.26 a share as the high costs of items such as paint and steel ate at margins.Hershey, the confectionery company, also admitted it was struggling with margins given the rising cost of cocoa and sugar, but still managed to deliver fourth-quarter earnings in line with expectations. Shares were up 3.1 per cent to $48.61.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.3 per cent to 1,304.03, keeping above the psychologically significant 1,300 level.The Dow Jones Industrial Average maintained the 12,000 mark, keeping flat at 12,041.97. The Dow closed above 12,000 on Tuesday for the first time since June 2008. The Nasdaq Composite was also flat at 2,750.16.“The markets are taking a little bit of a breather right now as investors try to work out whether there is more to go in this rally. There seems to be equal sentiment on both sides about whether we are due a correction or the bull run will continue,” said Christian Magoon of Magoon Capital, an independent consultancy on exchange traded funds.Investor sentiment was lifted by healthy figures from the ADP employment survey, which estimated that private non-farm payroll employment will have risen by 187,000 in January, ahead of the 140,000 forecast by economists.This prompted some optimism that the non-farm payrolls report to come out on Friday will be strong, but traders were reluctant to become too overjoyed as there is not always a direct correlation between the two figures. ADP also lowered its December figure to 247,000 new jobs from a previous estimate of 297,000.The financial sector saw the worst losses in the session. The S&P financials index was down 0.9 per cent to 223.50 led by Genworth Financial, a mortgage guarantor and life insurer, which fell 8.5 per cent to $12.76 after posting a loss in the fourth-quarter. Michael Frazier, chief executive, said that the results were not acceptable.Elsewhere, Marathon Oil, the fourth-largest US oil and gas group, reported fourth-quarter earnings up 99 per cent due to higher oil prices. While the results beat analysts’ expectations, the markets have come to expect impressive results after bumper earnings from other oil giants such as ExxonMobil, and so the stock fell 1.5 per cent to $46.89. Also in the sector Cameron International, which makes oil-and-gas pressure-control equipment, gained 4.5 per cent to $56.08 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings up 69 per cent.Solar stocks also rose after MEMC Electronic Materials, a silicon maker, gave a strong 2011 sales forecast. The stock jumped 15.4 per cent to $13.42 while First Solar, which makes photovoltaic panels, was up 5.3 per cent to $164.40.Meanwhile, shares in Electronic Arts rose 15.8 per cent to $18.09 after the company unexpectedly announced a $600m share buy-back. EA, the second-largest video game publisher, also reported earnings figures showing a 39 per cent growth in digital revenues in its third quarter, suggesting that its digital strategy was paying off.Elsewhere in the entertainment industry, Time Warner, the media group, reported fourth-quarter profits up 22 per cent and gave a forecast for double-digit earnings growth in 2011. The company, which owns television networks such as HBO, also announced an 11 per cent increase in the company’s dividend and a $5m share repurchasing plan sending the stock up 8.6 per cent to $35.10.NaviSite, a cloud computing company, soared 32.2 per cent to $5.46 on news it was going to be bought by Time Warner Cable for $230m, or $5.50 a share. Time Warner Cable was up 0.9 per cent to $69.33.Mattel, the world’s biggest toymaker, was up 0.9 per cent to $24.37 after reporting improved sales and boosting its dividend.In the pharmaceutical sector, Chelsea Therapeutics International was down 18.5 per cent to $5.04 after the biotechnology company said it was changing the goal for a late-stage study of its hypotension drug after a disappointing interim study.
126;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2011-02-02T01:19:38Z;EA shares rise after buy-back pledge;;Shares in Electronic Arts rose almost 10 per cent on news of a $600m share buy-back and signs that its digital strategy was paying off.EA, the second-largest video game publisher, reported 39 per cent growth in digital revenues year-on-year in its December quarter and said it was on track to hit its target of $750m in digital sales for the fiscal year ending in March.The Silicon Valley company has been exploring games platforms from the iPhone to the Kindle e-reader for higher growth markets than its packaged-goods disc-based business, where industry revenues fell 4 per cent last year.EA said Scrabble outsold every book to become the number-one selling item for the Kindle at the end of December, while Angry Birds, published by its Chillingo acquisition, was the number-one game on the iPhone and iPad in 2010.“We’re in the process of transforming our business from a packaged goods business to a digital one,” said Eric Brown, chief financial officer, in an FT interview.Downloadable expansion packs for its console games Fifa 11 and Battlefield: Bad Company 2 boosted third-quarter digital revenues to $211m, making 15 per cent of total revenues of $1.41bn – slightly below analyst expectations of $1.44bn. Earnings per share of 59 cents were 2 cents ahead of Wall Street’s forecast.EA said two of its December quarter titles – Medal of Honor and Need for Speed Hot Pursuit – had already sold more than 5m units to the retail channel.Mr Brown added that EA had sunk substantial development costs into Star Wars. EA has high hopes of digital subscription revenues from this online multiplayer game, which will launch this year and compete with Activision Blizzard’s dominant World of Warcraft franchise.EA said it would carry out share buy-backs worth $600m in the next 18 months to benefit its long-term investors, who have had a rough ride with the shares down more than 70 per cent in the past five years. Its shares rose as much as 9.7 per cent to $17.13 in after-hours trading in New York.
127;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Video game industry defends then condemns itself;;The video game industry has simultaneously tried to neutralise and amplify criticism of its skills in creating addictive violent games these past few days.The Entertainment Software Association launched a pre-emptive strike against a new study suggesting games contributed to depression, while Electronic Arts revealed how it had tried to shock more than 200 mums into condemning its violent sequel Dead Space 2.Confusing? Yes, but this was no coordinated strategy, merely a coincidence that illustrates how the industry pushes the limits to sell games, while using its lobbying arm to defend it against allegations that it goes too far.The ESA alleged on Thursday that the February issue of Pediatrics “contains a flawed study from longtime video game critic, Douglas Gentile. In the study, Gentile seeks to link video game use to mental health problems in children in Singapore. This is the latest report from a researcher who has a long history of attacking video games based on claims that have been the subject of substantial criticism”.The Gentile report has since received substantial media coverage. It studied 3,000 children and teens in Singapore over three years and found 9 per cent qualified as being pathological video gamers. Among these any depression and anxiety were worsened by game playing, it said. The study recommends “screen time” for children and teens should be limited to no more than two hours a day.Richard Taylor, an ESA spokesman, said: “There simply is no concrete evidence that computer and video games cause harm. In fact, a wide body of research has shown the many ways games are being used to improve our lives through education, health and business applications.”Tell that to more than 200 women herded one by one into a viewing studio by EA to see some of the bloodiest excerpts from Dead Space 2, which launches next week,and give their reactions on camera.“Trash, hate it, awful, horrible, why would they even make something like this?” were some of the comments.“It’s not a game, it’s a dangerous, mind-numbing, mind-altering demonic weapon,” said one woman, which sounded like a more graphic summation of Dr Gentile’s conclusions.Perhaps the good doctor could use some of these opinions, handily provided in EA’s YouTube and website campaign “Your Mom Hates Dead Space 2” , in his next study?
128;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-12-22T19:12:43Z;Getting over Lehman;The S&P 500 suggests we are back to where we were before the crash;So everything will be OK after all. Just in time for Christmas, the US stock market on Tuesday returned at last to the level it held on September 12th 2008 – the final day of trading before Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy. The S&P 500 index did briefly bounce amid the confusion of the following week, as plans for the troubled asset relief programme provided fleeting hopes of stability but it has been a long journey back. Investors now face a very different market from the one that closed on that nervous autumn afternoon.Judged by the best performer over the period, Americans stayed at home and watched videos: subscription service Netflix is up sixfold. But it is perhaps more a reflection of how rapidly technology fortunes change that tech claims seven of the other top-10 performance spots while also accounting for two of the worst: games maker Electronic Arts and semiconductor wafer manufacturer MEMC both dropped by two-thirds.There is a survivorship bias, with several banks no longer in the index but the two worst performers reflect their diminished status after state rescues: AIG down 77 per cent, and Citigroup down 73 per cent.Most sectors have barely budged but after two years of crisis and recession one surprise is that the consumer discretionary sector is the best performer, worth 22 per cent more than it was pre-Lehman. The financial index, meanwhile, is down 24 per cent. More surprisingly, Standard & Poor’s data show the proportion of the index in financials, at 15.9 per cent, is actually larger than the 15.3 per cent pre-Lehman, because new banks have entered the index. This is still down from the 20 per cent peak in 2007.As to the future, the market is cheaper as a multiple of earnings but pays almost a fifth less in dividends.

129;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-12-13T09:50:50Z;Computer games;Digital downloads offer hope for struggling sellers;"Virtual goods have been creating bother for centuries – at least since the sale of papal indulgences sparked the Reformation. With online computer games, the scope to sell the intangible has expanded enormously – from virtual money in FarmVille on Facebook to the highly addictive alternative reality provided by World of Warcraft. Those to suffer this time are the businesses that sell computer games as packaged goods: the share price for Electronic Arts, the second-biggest US publisher, still languishes below a low set in late 2008.Other factors have hurt EA, which was lossmaking for the past three years. The computer game business looks ever more like Hollywood in its search for hits – Call of Duty: Black Ops, made by larger competitor Activision Blizzard, recently set a record with $360m of sales on its first day of release. That means higher development costs and bigger losses if a game turns into a turkey. Also, the hardware cycle leads a similar cycle of buying habits for games; software sales for the ageing Nintendo Wii and the DS and PSP hand-held systems have fallen.Still, restructuring has tamed EA’s costs and it is set to be profitable again this year. Lurking within is a sizeable and rapidly growing business in games downloaded digitally, which now contributes a fifth of its sales. The company is the largest maker of games for mobile devices, leaving it well placed as smartphone sales rocket upwards. A Star Wars-themed massive multiplayer online (MMO) game set for release next year should also attract a sizeable chunk of the 12m or so MMO subscribers online.All that is available at a multiple of 18 times next year’s earnings, relatively cheap compared to the multibillion-dollar valuations bandied about for Zynga, publisher of FarmVille.

130;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-12-09T07:27:46Z;EA launches Apple Game Center rival on iPhone;;Electronic Arts is launching a rival games portal to Apple’s Game Center on the iPhone and iPad touch on Thursday.Apple has approved the video game publisher’s Pogo app, which brings its PC browser-based casual games service to the App Store.EA is introducing five games at launch with its app, which contains ads that can be removed for a $2.99 one-time in-app payment.Members of Club Pogo, a $40 a year service that offers exclusive and ad-free games within Pogo.com, also get ad-free game play on the new app.EA has released many stand-alone game apps for Apple’s mobile devices, but the introduction of a portal is the first of its kind from a major video games publisher.Apple introduced its Game Center hub in September with the 4.1 update of its iOS operating system.It allows developers to add Game Center functionality to their apps and players to choose them from within the hub and share their experiences with friends. Social features include leaderboards and achievements, while an auto-matching feature can set up multiplayer games with friends.EA is extending Pogo’s leaderboards, rewards and challenges to the iPhone and adapting its own existing games. The five launch titles are a balloon-popping game called Poppit!, the Word Whomp spelling game, Turbo 21 Blackjack, Mahjong Safari and the puzzle game Sweet Tooth 2.“It’s our intention to add new games on a regular basis as well as other functionality,” Michael Marchetti, senior vice president for Pogo, told me.It’s part of a new multi-platform strategy from EA to increase digital revenues – Pogo is also being beta-tested on Facebook currently.Apple clearly has no problem with EA setting up shop on its own platform. It will get its usual cut from sales by Pogo and the app is likely to draw more people to Apple devices.
131;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-11-24T22:43:26Z;Tapping into a revenue stream;The mobile phone app market has taken off with the iPhone;When pop singer Katy Perry launched her single “Firework”, one of the first places fans were able to listen to the song was on an iPhone through a bespoke version of the highly popular Tap Tap Revenge game.The mobile phone app, which allows users to tap the phone in time to the music, provided a clever marketing platform for the singer. But for US-based developer Tapulous, which launched the game for free a week ahead of the song’s release to US radio stations, it offered a fresh way to get gamers hooked on its apps.The Tap Tap Revenge app has been downloaded more than 40m times and more than 25m songs have been downloaded within the game, including free and paid downloads.Tapulous’s collaborations with acts such as Coldplay and Lady Gaga have also helped the games developer tap into a sizeable revenue stream. Its success attracted the attention of Disney Mobile, which acquired Tapulous earlier this year for an undisclosed sum.Tapulous is one of several small companies to ride the wave of mobile apps in the past two years. But as the market becomes increasingly crowded, and well-established large groups jostle with the minnows, developers are finding they have to work harder to stand out.Apps have been offered on mobile handsets for years and more recently have emerged on social networking platforms such as Facebook. But it was only when Apple launched the 3G iPhone in 2008 and started offering easily downloadable app software through its iTunes store that the market really opened up.According to research firm Gartner, revenue from mobile apps is expected to hit at least $6.8bn this year and could be worth $29.5bn by 2013.Apple’s early success and the launch of smartphone handsets operating on Google’s Android operating system have encouraged a wave of kitchen-table entrepreneurs as well as more established players to try to make money out of apps. Apple boasts more than 250,000 apps and the Android and Nokia app markets are rushing to catch up.Ben Holmes, a partner at venture capital firm Index Ventures, says the mobile app market has changed dramatically in the past two years. Previously, apps were sold already installed on a phone, and how much a developer made depended on the success of the handset. Now small players are generally operating on a level playing field with big companies and venture capitalists such as Index are seeing the opportunities for investment.Malcolm Barclay, a UK-based app developer, had been contracting for years when he realised he could make up to £100,000 ($158,000) by focusing on making apps full-time. “I started over two years ago. I was one of the first in there with a free application – Tube Status, which gives you the status of the London Underground lines,” he says. “As soon as it went in there, it went crazy. I had requests flooding in for more features and functionality – maps, departure boards. So I decided to sit down and build a pay-for app.” He says that within a few months, he realised that could make a living with the new app which he called Tube Deluxe, an evolution of his original creation.Every week he sells thousands of his apps at prices ranging from 59p to £1.79. He has to pay some royalties: after Apple takes its cut, he gets about 36p from a 59p sale.Mr Barclay says once an app is released, in order to keep customers interested, developers must continually update and polish the product. “When they first came out, apps were very simple and people were easily impressed. Now they’re not . . . People’s expectations have risen exponentially,” he says.Rael Boj set up Piky Team, a games developer based in France, less than a year ago. His Nude Runner-Girl Edition, an adult game app featuring a nude cartoon girl, recently made the top 10 in the US iTunes app charts.Mr Boj says that if you are lucky you can get back about a year’s investment. However, he stresses the importance of being highly flexible and employing freelancers, rather than staff, for big jobs. “It’s dangerous to go further when you’re a small independent studio. It’s really easy to lose money,” he says.Smaller developers such as Mr Boj are increasingly coming up against competition from large companies – including often giving their apps away for nothing as part of a wider marketing campaign. Scrabble, Mono­poly and Need for Speed by Electronic Arts, the games publisher, have all proved popular. Barclaycard’s free waterslide game, which was tied into a television advertisement, briefly topped the charts earlier this year.Analysts say that as bigger companies join the gold rush, making money out of apps will increasingly be down to good marketing, a clever idea and a lot of luck.Howard Tomlinson, managing director of UK-based games developer Astraware, who found early success with apps for Palm, says that while the size of the apps market “is technically huge”, few people are making money from it. “There are a massive number of Android users, but very few purchase products because so much is free.”Patrick Mork, chief marketing officer at independent app store GetJar, agrees. “Yes, there are thousands of apps on Apple, but less than 1 per cent will make any significant money.” He says the “freemium model”, whereby apps are offered for free but developers then charge for in-application extras, is becoming increasingly popular and is potentially lucrative if developers come up with a sensible business plan.Astraware’s strategy has been to create lots of products and release them on as many platforms as possible. “I can’t predict in advance which apps will make money, but in the early stages I can often see which ones won’t and then stop working on it,” says Mr Tomlinson. Testing a game on children, for example, to see if it has a wider appeal is a good way of working out early on if the app will work.Marketing is key. On Facebook, when a game is downloadedit registers on a user’s news feed and spreads virally to friends. For Apple apps, what determines success is how far up the iTunes chart they are. Unless a developer is in the top 25, they do not get enough volume to make money either on a pay-per-download or advertising model.Angry Birds, developed in Sweden and marketed by UK-based Chillingo, has maintained a high ranking on app charts for months. Chillingo, which was last month acquired by Electronic Arts, experiments with business models and platforms. The full game costs 99 cents in the Apple store but on the Android platform is free to download.Tapulous also uses a number of different models to monetise its apps.“Our free, franchise games including Tap Tap Revenge and Riddim Ribbon, feature advertising, in-app commerce, virtual goods as well as high-profile integrated sponsorships. In addition to ‘freemium’ games, we also release premium games that are pay-to-download,” says Bart Decrem, general manager of Disney Mobile and original co-founder of Tapulous.As the technology changes so rapidly, inevitably developers hoping to profit from their apps will have to continue to experiment. “I failed several times before and I’ll probably fail again,” says Mr Boj. “When I tell people I make iPhone apps they say, ‘Oh you’re a millionaire then’. The App Store has that image of successful developers that sell thousands of apps a day. But a large part of the store is made of unsuccessful apps. Lot of studios have invested and lost money.”
132;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-11-19T13:30:28Z;Vivendi sees continued success for COD franchise;;Activision’s developers can continue to replicate the success of the Call of Duty franchise, said the chief of parent Vivendi, as its latest Black Ops game broke another sales record.Jean-Bernard Lévy, chairman and chief executive of Vivendi, told investors and analysts at the Morgan Stanley TMT conference in Barcelona that Activision, the US publisher in which it holds a majority stake, had overhauled its development studios to ensure the future success of Call of Duty games.The claims come as Activision reported Black Ops generated $650m in global sales during its first five days since its release last week. That tops the $550m from the previous game in the COD series, Modern Warfare 2.“We have broken our own record. I am very, very pleased,” said Mr Lévy.More than 2.6m people have played the shooter, according to Activision, logging millions of online multiplayer sessions – a key part of the game’s appeal.“Call of Duty has become the first entertainment property in history to set five-day launch records for two consecutive years across all forms of entertainment,” said Robert Kotick, Activision Blizzard’s chief executive. “The title’s success illustrates the mass appeal of interactive entertainment as millions of consumers are choosing to play Call of Duty: Black Ops at unprecedented levels rather than engage in other forms of media. The number of people playing online and the number of hours they are playing demonstrates how online gaming has become a mainstream form of entertainment and certainly validates Activision Blizzard’s leadership role in online entertainment.”Several video game franchises have sold in high quantities through several releases over many years, often outlasting movie brands. For example, Nintendo recently marked 25 years since its first Super Mario game and the latest titles for its Wii and DS consoles continue to sell well, while Electronic Arts has revived its Fifa soccer franchise after a blip a few years ago.But some analysts have questioned how many times Activision can repeat its success with COD, especially in the wake of key staff departures at Infinity Ward, the studio that developed Modern Warfare 2.Mr Lévy said that Activision had “got over” the problems at Infinity Ward, leaving the prospects for the quality of future games looking secure.“The Treyarch studio, which made this year’s game, has done better than what Infinity Ward could achieve a year ago,” Mr Lévy said.“We have reconstructed Infinity Ward, we are very happy with the way we have been able to reconstruct it.”He added: “We also have a third studio, which was created a year and a half ago, called Sledgehammer, which is working on Call of Duty properties. We believe this set-up of studios. . . has demonstrated it can do very well, for sure.”The eighth game in the series is slated for release towards the end of 2011, although few details of the title have yet been released.
133;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-11-08T02:07:32Z;‘Call of Duty’ aims to capture digital sales;;Call of Duty: Black Ops from Activision Blizzard, which launches on Tuesday, is expected to crush formidable opposition and become the biggest selling action video game of the year.The game, made by developer Treyarch, is expected to sell 13m-15m units this quarter, slightly less than its Modern Warfare predecessor made by the Infinity Ward studio. But this will only be the start of a campaign to fulfil the game’s earnings potential.Its predecessor, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, remained the top game in the following three quarters after its release a year ago, helped by significant digital sales of add-on map packs that extended the battlefield and the franchise.Digital revenues are a bright spot for an industry that has seen an 8 per cent decline of its traditional “packaged goods” disc-based business so far this year, according to the NPD research firm.Retail sales have become a double-edged sword for publishers – the game discs that are sold are often traded back once played by consumers and exchanged at the stores for other used games, denying publishers further revenues.Digital extensions of games cannot be traded and neither can mini-games sold online through stores such as Xbox Live Arcade. Publishers are also selling virtual goods and pursuing subscription models for games that can be played online.“Digital is really starting to have an impact this year – the publishers have started to figure out what’s working and what’s not working,” says Doug Creutz, video game analyst at Cowen and Company.“[Video game publishers’] stocks are trading as cheaply as they ever have been, but I think there’s the potential for their economics to improve as revenue shifts more to digital, which tends to reduce the problem of used games sales.”Last week, Activision reported 15 per cent growth in digital sales in the first nine months over 2009, while Electronic Arts, creator of the Medal of Honor game, reported 35 per cent growth over its past two quarters compared to the year before.This came from growth in social gaming, iPad and iPhone game sales and downloadable content related to its packaged goods, where such sales were up 200 per cent.NPD, the official source for industry figures, has tended to ignore these sales in the past as it has charted declines in hardware and software sales over the past two years. One telling statistic though is that its accessories category is no longer dominated by sales of controllers.For every month since March, the Xbox Live 1600-point card – used to buy virtual goods and digital games from the console’s marketplace – has been the top-selling accessory.Xbox Live membership allows players to fight one another in online multiplayer extensions of the console’s titles, where gameplay is free on standard battlefields.Michael Pachter, video game industry analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities, says the billions of hours of free play taking place there, by gamers choosing not to go on to buy the extra map packs, is a “high-class problem” for the publishers.“This kind of gaming is becoming so addictive that when the publishers choose to monetise it they will have a willing audience, so it’s a great thing,” he says.NPD is now responding to industry pressure and looking at the bigger picture.It reported last month that while US consumers spent $3.7bn on new physical video and PC game software in the first half of this year, another $2.6bn to $2.9bn was spent in other areas.These were used games, game rentals, subscriptions, digital downloads of full games, social-networking games, downloadable content and mobile game apps.This holiday season, publishers are turning back to the traditional hard-core gamers and their staple first-person shooters. While social gaming on sites such as Facebook and mobile gaming on Apple devices are big growth areas, Doug Creutz says they serve a different audience.“The console gaming experience can’t be replicated on Facebook or the iPad, where there is a different type of consumer, who maybe got interested in the Wii and Guitar Hero and has moved on, but it’s a consumer the publishers were not really counting on in the first place.”
134;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-11-05T00:56:47Z;Activision boosted by online revenues;;Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest video game publisher, has reported third-quarter sales and profits well ahead of forecasts, as digital sales compensate for the industry’s poor performance at retail.Disc-based “packaged goods” sales of console games are down 8 per cent in the US in the first nine months of this year, according to the NPD research firm, but online revenues are booming.“Around 50 per cent of our revenues year-to-date are coming from digital sources,” said Bobby Kotick, Activision chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times.The publisher reported revenues of $857m and earnings per share of 12 cents against Wall Street expectations of $747m and 9 cents, respectively.On Tuesday it will release what is expected to be the biggest industry blockbuster of the year, Call of Duty: Black Ops, but it was cautious in raising its full-year guidance to $4.45bn in revenues and earnings of 74 cents per share.Activision has become less dependent on console-based sales since its merger with Blizzard, maker of the World of Warcraft online role-playing PC game that has more than 12m subscribers worldwide.It also benefits from downloadable content sales on the consoles that follow on from disc sales – such as new map packs that extend the playing field of its Call of Duty game.Electronic Arts, the second-largest third-party publisher, surprised the market this week with quarterly figures also boosted by such digital sales.While Activision reported 15 per cent growth in the first nine months compared with 2009, EA reported 35 per cent growth in digital sales over its past two quarters.This came from growth in social gaming, iPad and iPhone game sales and downloaded content related to packaged goods, where sales were up 200 per cent.US consumers spent $3.7bn in the first half of 2010 on physical console and PC software, according to NPD, but $2.6bn-$2.9bn was spent in other ways on games, largely digital.The industry hopes for a boost from motion controllers, with Microsoft releasing its Kinect controller on Thursday and raising its sales forecast to 5m units this quarter, up from 3m.
135;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
136;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-10-18T16:26:29Z;S Korean games group on the prowl;;The ballooning market for companies developing games for mobile devices and social networking websites is forming a bubble, according to one of the world’s biggest online game companies.Nexon, the biggest South Korean online game company by revenue, said it was on the hunt for overseas acquisitions. But Choi Won Hyuck, its public relations director, told the Financial Times that recent deals in the sector indicated “there is a bubble in the market right now”.Nexon, which had Won703bn ($585m) in revenues last year, has already turned to acquisitions to expand its reach from traditional online games on the PC to newer, fast-growing platforms – notably gaming on mobile devices and on social networking websites such as Facebook.The privately held company acquired two South Korean rivals, Ndoors and Gamehi, earlier this year, and this month expanded its reach in South America and Europe by taking a 30 per cent stake in Flash game developer BoomBang Games of Spain for an undisclosed amount.Nexon’s moves are part of a recent flurry of deals in the sector, where big players have snapped up promising start-ups. Disney Interactive paid $563m for Playdom, a two-year-old social gaming company, in July, while Electronic Arts paid $300m for Playfish last November.Last week, Japanese social gaming company DeNA bought Ngmoco , a San Francisco start-up, for $400m, or 10 times Ngmoco's initial funding. Mr Choi said he believed Ngmoco’s selling price was significantly raised because there were multiple bidders.With such competition pushing up prices, “it’s now a very big risk to make such acquisitions”, Mr Choi said.But Mr Choi said that despite the high prices, Nexon was still actively seeking more acquisition opportunities, particularly among companies specialising in developing games aimed at the iPhone, Apple’s smartphone, and the iPad, its newer tablet device, as well as social gaming companies in Europe and South America.“If the potential of the company is very good then we will still buy it. But there are also alternatives such as business alliances,” he said.Some analysts say the large price tag attached to relatively small companies is justified. Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games at Screen Digest, a research company, said that while the amount paid on recent deals appeared high based on the target’s financial performance, the value to the acquirer was often seen in the target’s potential and market position.“These deals were about getting access to a specific expertise and position in the market,” he said.The Ngmoco deal, for example, gives DeNA an entry into the US market. Ngmoco makes games for the iPhone and has also developed a social network for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad that connects gamers, he said.“This particular area is very hot because it is the intersection between social networking and app games on a mobile,” said Mr Harding-Rolls.
137;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-10-12T21:34:16Z;Japan’s DeNA snaps up US rival;;A two-year-old San Francisco gaming start-up that raised $40m in funding has been sold for up to 10 times that amount to Japanese social gaming company DeNA.The acquisition of ngmoco for up to $400m is another example of the dealmaking taking place in mobile and social gaming.Disney Interactive paid $563m for two-year-old social gaming company Playdom in July and will pay $200m more if it hits stipulated growth targets.Electronic Arts, the second-largest video game publisher, paid $300m for Playfish last November, with a further $100m dependent upon future performance.Ngmoco has won the same deal with DeNA, with $100m of the deal dependent upon reaching performance milestones by the end of next year.The company, which began by focusing on games for the iPhone, was founded by video game industry veterans, including former Electronic Arts executive Neil Young, who became its chief executive. It was one of the first start-ups to benefit from an investment from the iFund, a $100m fund set up by venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers to back iPhone developers. Initial funding of $5.6m was followed by further injections of $10m and $24.2m.The rising popularity of the iPhone and iPod Touch as games platforms has coincided with the growth of social gaming on networks such as Facebook, where Zynga, a Silicon Valley start-up, dominates. Zynga is expected to pursue an initial offering.Nearly 57m people in the US played a game on a social network over the three months of summer, according to a report in September by the NPD research firm. Of those, a 10th spent real money buying virtual currency or goods for their game.DeNA is a leading mobile gaming company in Japan, whose purchase will be helped by the strong yen against the dollar. The two companies will merge mobile and social gaming.In a blog note, ngmoco’s founders said they would launch a Western smartphone version of DeNA’s social games network, Mobage, which has tens of millions of users in Japan playing hundreds of applications woven together by a connected service. Ngmoco also aims to bring its games to Android devices.
138;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-09-30T21:30:41Z;Facebook Assassin makes good companion;;Ubisoft released a version of its hit video game Assassin ‘s Creed on Facebook on Thursday as part of a new digital strategy it calls companion gaming.It looks a more joined-up concept than that of Electronic Arts, which was the first major publisher to bring a big franchise to Facebook with its Fifa Superstars soccer game in June.Assassin’s Creed: Project Legacy on Facebook is a standalone game like the Fifa one, but it also has features that mean gameplay translates into benefits for players when they move on to its big brother, the forthcoming Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood on other platforms. Similarly, playing Brotherhood will earn rewards for the Facebook game.Specifically, items collected in Project Legacy will unlock exclusive items in Brotherhood and finding landmarks will unlock rewards in both. In Brotherhood, assignments can be created and then completed in Project Legacy earning rewards in both games. Project Legacy also allows training of your guild members and gives some experience of Brotherhood, whetting players’ appetites for the new game.“We hope to create a virtuous cycle between the Facebook game and the Brotherhood game, meaning that I don’t have to leave that game experience,” said Chris Early, vice president of digital publishing, at a press launch in San Francisco.“The theory is that more and more of our brands will matter to you…because you will be creating carry-on value from your play and interaction in one type of game through to the main game or other games that relate to it.”In another example of companion gaming, Ubisoft said it would launch a Facebook version of the CSI franchise later this year. The publisher has sold more than 5m units of the video game version of the crime-scene investigation TV drama worldwide.In CSI: Crime City on Facebook, players will solve crimes created by the show’s writers. If they buy CSI: Fatal Conspiracy - the latest version of the core game due this autumn – they can unlock a position of elite investigator and get special lab items to aid their forensic attempts to solve the crime.Forensic examination of this digital strategy tells me Ubisoft is innocent of trying to make money from virtual goods in Facebook, but guilty of trying to build brand loyalty with incentives and a persistent, interlinked gaming experience. They might just get away with it.
139;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-09-28T18:42:54Z;Virtual goods enjoy real-life commercial boom;;Spending on virtual goods is booming through sites such as Facebook and iPhone apps even though consumers continue to pinch pennies in the wake of the recession.The total US market size for virtual goods will reach $2.1bn next year, up from $1.6bn this year and $1.1bn in 2009, according to a new report by Inside Network, a market research group providing news and research on Facebook and social gaming.The near doubling of sales in two years attests to the swift growth in social games from companies such as Zynga, Playdom and Playfish.The games, played on Facebook and other social networks, are free but allow users to buy virtual goods, such as a tractor to harvest crops on Farmville.Justin Smith, founder of Inside Network said: “Social is the largest and fastest growing category and we expect it to be for the years to come”.The growing market for virtual goods has sparked a wave of acquisitions in Silicon Valley.In 2009 Electronic Arts, the world’s second-largest video game publisher, bought Playfish for $400m.In early 2010 Walt Disney bought Playdom for up to $735m.Charles Hudson, former head of business development at Serious Business social games producer, said: “Hundreds of millions of dollars in venture investments have been injected into virtual goods so far.“It’s now clear that virtual goods are seriously impacting businesses across all types of media.”Google has also been buying its way into the market. In the span of a month it bought Slide, another social game maker, and Jambool, a company that makes virtual currency used on social networks.Mr Smith said: “I do expect, as Google gets more involved, for virtual goods to be a big part of their social strategy”.Facebook is also moving to take a sizeable cut of the virtual goods sold through applications on its site.The network has rolled out credits, its own virtual currency, and Zynga – the largest of the social game makers – now uses the Facebook credits as its exclusive currency.Mr Smith said: “The main idea behind credits is that it will standardise the virtual goods payments process to enable more people to become paying customers in games”.
140;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Scrabble makes Kindle casual games platform;;The Kindle is finally being taken a little more seriously as a games platform with Electronic Arts releasing a version of Scrabble for the eReader on Friday.To date, there had been few diversions from the act of reading on the Kindle and its capabilities as a games platform, with its grayscale screen and lack of touch control, seemed limited.Browsing through the Kindle store’s game offerings, there are crosswords, Sudoku and Solitaire from small publishers and a couple of free word games developed by Amazon itself.But Scrabble for Kindle from EA Mobile costs $5 and represents the first attempt by a major video game publisher to tap the Kindle’s growing audience.The game has three difficulty levels and three modes – solo, versus computer and “Pass N’ Play” for playing with friends. However, it does not take advantage of its connectivity to enable wireless multi-player gaming.Statistics can be tracked from game to game and play can be paused and resumed.The launch is part of EA’s strategy to extend the Scrabble franchise, in partnership with its owner Hasbro. It is on the iPhone and iPod touch, but has yet to arrive on Android devices.It may be that the Kindle is restricted to digitised parlour games like this, featuring cards, words and numbers. But with colour and touch-control likely to feature in future versions, gaming on the Kindle could extend beyond this rudimentary casual category.

Pär Jörgen Pärson of Northzone Ventures, an early investor in the music group, collected the award for the $50m fundraising last year, including investment from the charitable foundation of Hong Kong’s Li Ka-shing.Spotify, led by Daniel Ek, has won various plaudits, but the big question is whether the service can actually make money, as currently its losses far outstrip revenues from ads and subscription.people@ft.com
142;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-09-06T19:53:42Z;England manager backs Rooney;;Wayne Rooney flew to Switzerland with the rest of the England football team, troubled by allegations about his private life that threaten his carefully constructed public image but determined to turn out for his country in Tuesday’s European Championship qualifier.The 24-year-old Manchester United striker, England’s most prized merchandise and the team’s only player with a world-class reputation, was confronted with Sunday newspaper claims he had cheated on his wife, Coleen, with a prostitute.Rooney, seeking to recover his footballing reputation after a dismal World Cup, was “ready to play”, said Fabio Capello, the England coach, at a press conference in Basel.“He wants to play and I’m sure he will play tomorrow very well. We are here to play, not to focus on the private lives of players.”Publication of the personal goings-on of England footballers have become wearily familiar. The Football Association, struggling to find new sponsors after the World Cup, must now seek replacements with its biggest box-office asset tarnished, said Tim Crow of Synergy, the sponsorship consultancy.“The FA will have their heads in their hands now,” he said.But Rooney’s alleged indiscretions could be especially damaging financially for one of the highest earners in football. They come less than a year after Tiger Woods lost a string of endorsements following ­revelations of the golfer’s private life.As well as a weekly wage said to be in the region of £100,000 and £760,000 of image rights earned in twice-yearly payments, Rooney has sponsorship deals with Coca-Cola, Nike and EA Sports. He also has a lucrative five-book deal with publishers Harper­Collins.He would have more sponsorship deals, but at a court hearing earlier this year his agent revealed that the number allowed by Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United manager, was restricted to five.Rooney shared top-billing in Nike’s three-minute World Cup television advertisement. Responding to the revelations, the sportswear manufacturer said it was a private matter, as did Coca-Cola.Nigel Currie, of sports marketing company Brand Rapport, said while sponsors were likely to stick with Rooney, the player and his wife had built a public profile as a couple along the lines of Victoria and David Beckham. That was now at risk.“They were the new kids on the block. As a joint brand they were absolutely massive,” said Mr Currie. “It was a potentially huge partnership and that is where the loss will be.”Rooney, something of a tearaway as a youngster, had worked on curbing his explosive reputation. He was a member of the welcoming party when a Fifa delegation was in Manchester last month as part of the governing body’s inspection of England’s bid to host the 2018 World Cup.“Whereas Beckham is a national treasure, Rooney is the embodiment of England,” said one senior sponsorship expert. “He had the potential to be England captain and Manchester United captain. That has receded. It’s start-again time.”
143;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-09-05T21:08:54Z;Lovefilm strengthens digital ability;;Lovefilm, the DVD mail order rental company, is looking to accelerate its digital distribution push with the hiring of two new board members.The company has appointed UK gaming specialist Kristian Segerstråle, the chief executive of Playfish, which was acquired by Electronic Arts, and Roland Steindorf, who helped develop Kabel Digital, a German digital cable pay-TV platform.The move comes as the company’s chief executive Simon Calver and chairman Charles Gurassa have been beefing up both its management and board capabilities.It appointed Guardian Media Group’s director of digital strategy and development, Simon Waldman, as Lovefilm’s head of DVD rental subscription service, taking charge of the website. Dawn Airey, who is leaving Five as chairman and chief executive following the UK channel’s acquisition by the Daily Express publisher Richard Desmond, joined the company as a non-executive director in June.While Lovefilm – which is backed by venture capital firms Arts Alliance Media, Index Ventures, Balderton Capital and DFJ Esprit – has long been regarded as an IPO candidate, the company is focused on increasing value by moving from a traditional DVD rental operation to a digital downloading business. There are no immediate plans to float.The company, whose list of investors also includes Amazon, abandoned talks with private equity firms including KKR and Silver Lake Partners last year.Lovefilm has also sought to bring its internet library of films direct to the television set through deals with Sony and Samsung. The TV manufacturers are offering sets that can be connected directly to the internet, where users can download films directly from Lovefilm’s digital library.
144;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-08-17T19:22:52Z;Square Enix chief forecasts shift for games;;The head of Square Enix, the Japanese company behind hit games such as Final Fantasy and Tomb Raider, has predicted most games will be played online within the next five years.He also thinks valuations in the social games sector have become over-inflated.Speaking to the Financial Times ahead of GamesCom, Europe’s largest video gaming event, Yoichi Wada, president of Square Enix, predicted turmoil in the industry in the coming years as publishers and developers balance developing new online revenue models with their existing businesses of selling packaged discs.“Going forward, we think that online gaming is going to play a very important role …in 10 years’ time everything will be online and in five years’ time I think most of it will be,” Mr Wada said. “Because things do not progress in linear [fashion], it is difficult to foresee in the mid-term.”Last year, Square Enix acquired Eidos, the company behind Lara Croft, as part of a wider attempt to globalise the business. An online Lara Croft title was released this week, while Final Fantasy XIV will be available later this year as a massively multiplayer online game, competing with the likes of Activision Blizzard’s World of Warcraft.Many online games are offered for free, with players paying for extra levels or special items. Additional content can be sold to update traditional packaged games for consoles such as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.As well as expanding existing franchises online, Square Enix will look to develop new titles specifically for the web. Although no single online game has yet generated significant revenues for Square Enix, taken as a group, its digital-only titles will become more significant financially over the next year, he said.But he indicated it was unlikely Square will follow in the footsteps of Electronic Arts and Disney, which have recently paid huge sums for social gaming companies.Last November, EA acquired Playfish, best known for its Facebook game Pet Society, for up to $400m, including performance-related compensation. Last month, Disney paid up to $763.2m for Playdom, including earn-outs, in the same week it sold Miramax, the Pulp Fiction studio, for $660m.“Some of those social gaming companies have been acquired, but the move was too late, meaning the valuation was too expensive,” Mr Wada said. “The key question here is what they have bought by acquiring those companies? Have they been acquired for the sake of the customers, or have they acquired for the sake of the competence in creating or operating games? It is not very clear.”Mr Wada said it would be cheaper to headhunt new talent in this field, rather than buying young companies outright.
145;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-08-15T19:01:28Z;Why Playfish is rooting for Google Me;;As Google gears up its social push, attracting the right games to its platform will be critical. So the search giant will welcome the endorsement of Playfish, and with it, parent company Electronic Arts, for its plans in Google Me.I met Sebastien de Halleux, co-founder of Playfish and now also VP for strategic partnerships at EA Interactive, in London on Friday. Nine months after its $300m-plus acquisition by EA, Playfish is growing faster than it can hire, and Mr de Halleux remains effervescent about the potential for taking console franchises such as Fifa Soccer onto the web.But he wasn’t so thrilled about Facebook’s current attitude towards games developers, and welcomed the prospect of a stiffer competitor in the form of Google.Google and EA/Playfish have been working together for a while, putting games like Scrabble and Who Has The Biggest Brain onto iGoogle, its personalised homepage.If you’d missed that, you might be forgiven. The games are pretty buried in the iGoogle menus, unless you know what you’re looking for. Part of Mr de Halleux’s explanation for Google’s gaming plans is that it’s poor at dealing with what he calls “low intent” experiences.“On Facebook, you don’t search for a game, it comes to you,” he says, as people see their friends playing or are invited to join. “Not everyone will want to keep their social graph on Facebook, so we have integrated the social graph from Buzz and Gmail. What is missing is discoverability. That is the big bet that Google is making right now.”While Playfish is confident that people will come to Google to play games, “we are not certain they will search for it”.But Google’s assumptions about friend connections through Buzz and Gmail are pretty rough. Watching as people play games together could be a better way to learn about which of those contacts really are friends.“The same algorithms that crunch preferences for ads could weight the social graph by interest,” he says. “This is a level of skill set that Google clearly possesses that Facebook might not.”And the sooner it puts that to work, the better, as far as Playfish is concerned.Mr de Halleux has been concerned by changes to the Facebook platform in recent months – not only limiting developers’ ability to communicate with its users, which prompted Zynga’s (now resolved) spat with Facebook in the spring, but also more subtle changes, such as how games are bookmarked.“For a developer, our biggest problem is not creating great content, it’s creating visibility,” he says. “There’s no URL, there’s no directory. Facebook said they don’t want non-gamers to be spammed, so they tried to push most developers to use email. We don’t like to email when your next hand of Scrabble is up… Maybe that is an opportunity for someone to provide a nice alternative.”Mr de Halleux cited figures from AppData that show some of Playfish’s rivals losing significant chunks of their traffic on Facebook in recent months, which he attributes to these changes. He says Playfish itself has kept growing, but only because of a steady stream of new games, such as Fifa Superstars, Pirates Ahoy and My Empire.“After those changes there was an inflection. We didn’t like that – we don’t want anyone to decline at a stage where the industry should be growing.”He says Facebook should be nurturing one of the most popular activities on its site. But its slowness of providing its own payment system shows that Facebook’s priorities have been elsewhere, he says, such as attracting brand advertisers.“It creates unnecessary friction and tensions,” he says. “That creates opportunities for Google and Microsoft to create something different. Consumers like choice… The scale that Facebook has reached prevents smaller competitors from doing this.”If Google and Facebook really are at war, it’s worth remembering that Facebook’s predicted $1bn sales this year are still some way off the $24bn Google turned over in 2009. Talking to ad agencies, it’s not even clear that advertising money spent on Facebook is coming at the expense of search budgets.Still, even if search and social advertising aren’t on a collision course quite yet, Google is playing the long game here.
146;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Data and earnings lift US equities;;US stocks rose on Wednesday after better-than-expected economic data combined with a strong earnings report from Time Warner eased concerns about the pace of the global economic recovery.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,127.24, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to close at 10,680.43 and the Nasdaq was 0.9 per cent higher closing at 2,303.57.Investors were cheered by better-than-expected job and service sector data.Figures compiled by Automatic Data Processing showed private employers in the US added 42,000 jobs in July, above average estimates of 30,000. In June employers added 13,000 jobs, according to revised figures.The data came ahead of the government’s more comprehensive non-farm payroll figures, which will be released on Friday.The Institute of Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index rose from 53.8 to 54.3 last month, surprising economists who predicted a decline to 53.“We think this can serve as a real confidence shot in the arm for the market but [the market is] waiting for Friday’s payrolls to really get the all clear so that it can properly break out of the trading range of 1,050–1,120 that we’ve been stuck in for the last two to three months,” said Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial.He also said that the growth in advertising revenue at Time Warner and CBS could be a leading indicator of a rebound in business spending. Both media groups reported better-than-expected quarterly results.Time Warner rose 0.3 per cent to $32.47 after it beat expectations to report the highest growth in revenue in two years. An increase in cable television and magazine advertising helped it raise its full-year outlook and announce earnings per share from continuing operations of 50 cents, compared with an average estimate of 45 cents.CBS climbed 4.2 per cent to $15.64 after it also beat expectations, with adjusted earnings per share, excluding early repayment of debt and restructuring charges, at 25 cents compared with the consensus forecast of 21 cents.In contrast, AOL reported a loss for the second quarter. The net loss at the internet company spun off from Time Warner was $1.06bn compared with a net income of $90.7m a year earlier. Earnings were hit by a fall in advertising revenue and a goodwill impairment charge because of a slump in its share price. But its shares rose 7.7 per cent to $22.75.Electronic Arts jumped 7.4 per cent to $17.38 after the games software provider posted an unexpected profit on better-than-expected sales of video games including 2010 Fifa World Cup South Africa.In energy, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, which owns 25 per cent of the BP oil spill well, rose 4.3 per cent to $55.42 after it reported a loss of 8 cents per share for the quarter, narrowing from 48 cents a share for the same quarter last year. It also said that it had secured $6.5bn in loan commitments, in part to pay for the potential liability from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.Housebuilder PulteGroup was down 0.6 per cent to $8.38 after it reported a quarterly profit for the first time in almost four years, helped by tax benefits and lower land-related charges. Earnings of 20 cents per share compared with the average forecast for a loss of 1.5 cents per share.Goldman Sachs advanced 2.1 per cent to $156.41 after it was reported that the bank plans to spin off its proprietary trading business to comply with the new US financial reform legislation.Motorola rose 5.8 per cent to $8.06 after Carl Icahn, an activist investor who has called for the break up of the phone manufacturer, raised his stake in the company to almost 10 per cent.Among the fallers, high end supermarket Whole Foods dropped 8.4 per cent to $36.16 on the back of fears of slowing growth in its same store sales.In deal news, Barnes & Noble, the largest chain of bookshops in the US, surged 19.2 per cent to $15.31 after it announced it was putting itself up for sale.Rival Borders also rose, up 3 per cent to $1.36, after speculation that the two chains might merge.
147;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-07-29T06:49:36Z;Zynga takes $150m from Softbank (No mention of Google);;How do you say “Farmville” in Japanese?Zynga, maker of the popular social game, wants to find out.To do so, the San Francisco company is entering into a joint venture with Softbank to develop and distribute games in Japan. As part of the deal, Softbank is investing $150m in Zynga, and will help launch the new business unit, Zynga Japan, in Tokyo.Details of the partnership are scarce, but it will be interesting to see how Zynga’s games go over in Japan, a difficult market for foreign companies to crack. The deal also brings social gaming, which originated in Asian markets, full circle.This is the latest bullish move from the social games leader. It was only months ago that Zynga took $180m from a group including Andreessen Horowitz and Digital Sky Technologies, the Russian group which owns a major stake in Facebook.Since then, Zynga has partnered with Yahoo, launched another hit game on Facebook (that would be Frontierville), and mended its frayed relationship with Facebook.But there was no mention of any relationship between Zynga and Google in tonight’s last-minute release. Google is said to have invested about $150m in Zynga last month as well, and is rumoured to be developing its own platform for social games.If the Google investment is true, that brings Zynga’s total funds raised to as much as $500m, a huge amount for a private tech startup (especially one with low capital costs that is said to mint cash, as Business Insider points out).Plenty of that is going towards paying for Zynga’s more than 1,000 employees (and giving early employees some liquidity).But coming just a day after rival social game maker Playdom got snapped up by Disney, and months after rival Playfish was bought by Electronic Arts, it looks like Zynga is also looking to extend its runway, quite literally buying time as it waits for the public markets to open up.
148;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-07-22T18:30:50Z;US software group wins Premier League deal;;The Premier League made Electronic Arts, the games software provider, its official sports technology partner on Thursday, in the latest in a series of sponsorship deals with US groups.EA Sports, already the Premier League’s computer games licensee, will sponsor an enhanced player tracking performance index, giving fans data such as the distances players run, the speed of shots and the height they jump.The Premier League will install cameras at all stadiums to help gather the data, although it will take a season before the player tracking system is fully functional.EA Sports will receive on-screen branding rights when match statistics are shown, both in the UK and abroad.The deal extends the influence of US companies and individuals in football’s high-profile league. US interest in the Premier League has already led to deals with Nike, Budweiser and Wrigley’s, although the Budweiser deal has now lapsed.EA Sports, which has sold nearly 100m copies of its Fifa Soccer game worldwide, has also announced the renewal of its games licence for a further four years. The combined value of the deals is thought to be worth £10m-£15m to the Premier League.The extent of US involvement in the Premier League goes beyond sponsors, whose deals make up about 5 per cent of its £1bn annual turnover. ESPN, the US sports broadcaster, has a package of live Premier League matches and five clubs are owned or part-owned by US investors.Clubs have also made inroads into the US market. Manchester United’s kit and shirt sponsors are US companies and United and Tottenham Hotspur are on pre-season tours in the US.Tim Crow of sponsorship consultancy Synergy said: “The US is very much in the Premier League’s sights and has been for many of the clubs for a long time. United are getting hundreds of millions of dollars by their sponsorships. They’ve conquered it.”Football is less geared towards statistics than US sports such as American football and baseball, but Peter Moore, EA Sports president, said the increased use of data in the Premier League could help the sales of its football games in the US.“The US is a major market for us,” Mr Moore said. “Americans need to statistically analyse everything and this is where soccer befuddles many – it’s too fluid.”Richard Masters, the Premier League’s marketing director, said the greater use of technological data would help its growth in markets abroad.“We service 211 territories and we need to be presenting an enhanced product,” he said.“The broadcast enhancements through data and statistics will feed through in the next three years. The demand is coming from a number of different places.”He added that the sports technology sponsorship, its first new category since 2002, attracted “quite a lot of interest” from other technology companies.
149;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-07-04T16:00:53Z;Activision stays ahead of game market;;Activision claimed Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was the biggest entertainment launch to date when it was released last November. And eight months later, gamers are still avidly gunning down Russian terrorists and Afghan insurgents.You might expect the boss of the company behind the world’s most popular video game to be happy. But when it comes to Call of Duty, Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, feels he is missing out.A big part of the game’s appeal is its online multiplayer mode, which allows people to shoot at their friends from the comfort of their own sofas. Internet gaming is almost too popular, with some analysts blaming the 1.7bn hours of online play on Call of Duty between November and April for sluggish sales of newer titles.While console makers – particularly Microsoft with Xbox Live – receive regular subscription payments for online activity, games publishers such as Activision and Electronic Arts see little ongoing benefit beyond selling the original disc.“We’ve heard that 60 per cent of [Microsoft’s] subscribers are principally on Live because of Call of Duty,” says Mr Kotick. “We don’t really participate financially in that income stream. We would really like to be able to provide much more value to those millions of players playing on Live, but it’s not our network.”Downloads of maps and add-ons for Call of Duty have sold well. But missing the larger opportunity is surprising as Activision Blizzard pioneered multiplayer online gaming with its World of Warcraftfranchise.Warcraft, which is played on PC rather than PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 consoles, charges a subscription and is backed by a vast technical and customer-support infrastructure, which could easily be redirected to the Call of Duty world.Online subscriptions are important in the Chinese market, where mass piracy undermines disc sales.Mr Kotick sees an opportunity to break the consoles’ “walled gardens with new gamer-friendly PCs, designed to be plugged into the television. PCs have long been used for online play, but PC gaming remains niche when the games industry needs to widen its appeal.“We have always been platform agnostic,” says Mr Kotick. “[Consoles] do a very good job of supporting the gamer. If we are going to broaden our audiences, we are going to need to have other devices.”Activision will “very aggressively” support efforts by Dell and HP to connect PCs to TVs.Mr Kotick is excited by Microsoft’s motion-sensing controller. Xbox Kinect dispenses with the hand-held joystick in favour of a camera and microphone. He hopes Kinect will help revive the peripherals market along the lines of Activision’s Guitar Hero and DJ Hero. Mr Kotick remains bullish on “physical interfaces” in spite of February’s $409m writedown for its Guitar Hero business.Voice-controlled gaming holds the potential for attracting new kinds of players, he adds. “You’re going to see a tremendous amount of innovation in audio. Voice recognition is something people haven’t really thought about from a user interface perspective.”Modern video gaming warfare, it seems, includes short-term alliances and longer-term conflicts.
150;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-07-02T02:42:35Z;Disney deal aims to tap apps market;;Walt Disney has taken a significant step into the Apple iPhone applications business, buying Tapulous, a Silicon Valley start-up that makes mobile music games.The deal, which will be announced imminently, is for an undisclosed sum and is the first of its kind for Disney, which is keen to expand its presence in mobile games. The company has already acquired two development studios – one based in China and one in the Czech Republic – but the Tapulous deal is the first to involve a developer of applications – popularly known as “apps”.The Tapulous deal validates an economic model that did not exist until two years ago, when Apple launched the App Store. Since then, thousands of programmers have tried to get their wares distributed on the platform, which has close to 100m users.Big media companies such as Disney are monitoring the apps industry with increasing interest, competing with games companies, such as Electronic Arts, for popular developers.With initial public offerings of mobile games developers still rare, the interest of Disney and its rivals broadens the number of potential exits for investors in apps companies.Tapulous makes mobile games in the vein of Activision’s Guitar Hero. Its most popular title, Tap Tap Revenge, allows players to tap their iPhone to the beat of a song. Tapulous generates revenues from a range of sources: its games are free but players pay to buy particular songs.The Disney deal will see Bart Decrem, founder of Tapulous, join Disney to help manage its mobile games division. The deal was struck by Disney’s Interactive Media Group.Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has taken a great interest in the iPad and hailed it as a potential “game-changer” for the media industry.The Disney ABC Player app has been downloaded more than 850,000 times since the iPad was launched in April, with more than 4.5m episodes of ABC programmes played on the device.The studio’s latest film, The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, is the first new release to be offered via its movies app, along with other Disney movies that are already in cinemas. “The Disney movie app provides fans with a dynamic and engaging experience,” said Greg Brandeau, chief technology officer of Walt Disney Studios.The app can also connect consumers directly to online retailers such to purchase Disney movies on Blu-ray or DVD.
151;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Red dead THQ holds fire on Homefront shooter;;THQ received a bloody nose recently with the timing of the release of its mixed martial arts UFC Undisputed 2010 game.Brian Farrell, chief executive of the video game publisher, is hoping for a better outcome by holding fire with Homefront, a new first-person shooter that faces formidable opposition from Activision, Electronic Arts and Halo-maker Bungie.Homefront, where North Korea invades the US, was the subject of a major marketing putsch at the E3 video game trade show this week as THQ’s flagship game. Banners were all over the LA Convention Center and a troop dressed as North Korean soldiers marched into the hallsWhile the game will not appear until early next year, missing the holiday sales season, the reason is not the common one of development problems and slippage.THQ is instead determined to avoid a clash with other first-person shooters - Halo:Reach, the final Halo game from Bungie studios is released on September 14 in the US, EA’s Medal of Honor is out on October 12, Call of Duty: Black Ops from Activision follows on November 9 and Crytek’s Crysis 2 is due in December.“We’re targeting a certain timeframe when we can own the hearts and minds of the press, retail and consumers,” Mr Farrell told me in an E3 interview.That did not happen with UFC. UFC Undisputed 2009 was indeed the undisputed leader in video game sales in the second quarter a year ago.But the follow-up this year came up against Take-Two’s Red Dead Redemption, a Spaghetti Western-style shooter game that has sold more than 5m copies.“Pre-orders for UFC were 50 per cent up over last year so we think a lot of this year’s issue was the surprise-hit Red Dead Redemption sucking about $200m out of the game economy right when we launched – unlike last year when we were the title that sucked all the money out of the market,” said Mr Farrell.“We delivered an awesome game and ,by the end of the year, UFC will be one of the best-selling products.”Apart from better timing, Homefront will have the advantage of being a fresh intellectual property competing against retreads of other franchises, according to Mr Farrell.“Our advantage is that it’s new, there are products out there on their third, fourth, fifth iteration. Homefront is resonating as something new to the shooter genre- why am I shooting? I am defending the homeland against an oppressive force, it’s not just scripted running through an environment, we’re not derivative.”Having said that, the plot does sound a little like Sony and Insomniac Games’ Resistance 2 of 2008.Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two executive chairman, told me that Red Dead Redemption had established a franchise for itself and he had high hopes for the company’s next big release – Mafia II in August.But, like his THQ counterpart, he thought the economic environment was challenging with gamers being very selective about what they buy.“People are choosy in this economy. If you have anything short of a triple-A title, it’s going to be a really challenging time, it’s going to be very tough to have a B product out there at a time when consumers are being prudent with their dollars,” he said.
152;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-06-17T22:12:43Z;OnLive launches ‘cloud gaming’ service;;OnLive, a potentially revolutionary online gaming service, has been launched at the annual E3 video game trade show in Los Angeles in the US, to cautious support from the industry.The first large “cloud gaming” service aims to stream console versions of games over the internet to tens of thousands of players at once, removing the need for the console or for games to be bought in stores.The Silicon Valley-based start-up was flipping the switch on the new service on Thursday and making available 23 titles, including well-known games such as Assassin’s Creed II, made by Ubisoft, and Mass Effect 2 from Electronic Arts.The industry will want to see if OnLive’s technology can deliver video games without “latency” issues – delays of more than a few milliseconds in the action – to different devices over the internet.“We are using the internet and computers in ways that have never been tried before,” said Steve Perlman, OnLive founder and chief executive, in a blog note. “Like any new technology, you can expect a few bumps on take-off, until we reach cruising altitude and achieve a smooth flight.”Van Baker, video game platform analyst with Gartner, a research firm, said OnLive’s goals were challenging. “So many games require quick responses to be successful and I don’t see OnLive getting much traction because of performance and latency issues,” he said.“It’s very much an open question about whether they can succeed.”The digital service is attractive to games publishers in removing the costs of making and distributing packaged goods. They could cut out the cost of retailers and avoid both paying licensing fees to console makers and losing sales in the used disk-based games trade. But publishers are cautious about putting brand new releases on an unproven service and risking upsetting established relationships with retailers such as Gamestop.“Conceptually it’s phenomenal, but we’ll have to see how it works out in practice,” said Strauss Zelnick, executive chairman of Take-Two Interactive, whose current Borderlands and NBA 2K10 titles feature at the launch.“But your pre-existing channel is going to have something to say about it and retail represents 91 per cent of our business and we have to respect that.”OnLive will initially deliver its service to PCs and Mac computers. It plans to sell a small box to attach to a TV that adds internet connectivity and the ability to plug in a games controller.The initial roll-out is in the 48 contiguous US states.OnLive has received financial backing from AT&T, a telecoms operator in the US, the UK’s BT and Belgacom in Europe.It announced this week that AT&T was sponsoring free membership for a year for founding members, before a $5 a month subscription kicks in.
153;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-06-07T08:26:04Z;World Cup profits;Coca-Cola has its own previous performance to beat;Obvious bets tend to offer little reward. Investors may be tired of Spain’s budget deficit woes, but its football team is already a well-backed favourite to win the World Cup in South Africa, which kicks off on Friday. Picking England to lose in the semi-final on penalties, at around 12-to-one odds, is perhaps a better balance of risk and reward. Looking for stock market kickers requires similar creativity.Beverages naturally head the line-up for industries to benefit: beer and football are familiar partners. Macquarie expects the average fan in South Africa to consume 51 litres of the stuff. Quenching thirsts will be the host nation’s SABMiller, which controls about 90 per cent of its domestic market. Although the brewer’s expected 4-6 per cent increase in domestic volume may not lift earnings materially, the tournament is a favourite marketing opportunity in other football-crazy emerging markets.FIFA World Cup partner Coca-Cola has its own previous performance to beat. During the 2006 tournament in Germany it recorded 15 per cent volume growth in the country, compared with none the previous quarter, notes UBS. Rexam, the can producer, should see good demand for high-margin promotional packaging. There are obvious football-related stocks such as sportswear maker Nike and Electronic Arts, which makes the official World Cup computer game. But such occasions are only theirs to lose.Instead consider local stock Bidvest, a company set to benefit directly but whose logo is not splashed all over TV screens. The behind-the-scenes logistics group, already well established in Europe and the Far East, provides everything from airport handling to food services. At 12 times prospective earnings, the group trades at a 16 per cent discount to global peers. It could prove to be this tournament’s dark horse.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
154;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-06-03T21:01:28Z;Football game kicks Facebook to higher league;;"The first big video game franchise to appear on a social network is launched on Friday when FIFA Superstars, a football World Cup game, goes live on Facebook.After the success of virtual pets, farms and mob warfare, the phenomenon of social gaming is moving to the next level as brands and publishers seek a slice of the biggest growth market in video games.More than 200m people play games on Facebook every month, with a handful of games – FarmVille, Treasure Isle, Café World, Mafia Wars and PetVille – accounting for more than half of those numbers. Independent publisher Zynga makes all of those games, creating an estimated $600m (€490m) a year in revenues. Sales of virtual goods topped $1bn in the US last year, according to a report by Inside Network, the research group.FIFA Superstars is made by Playfish, a social games developer bought by video games publisher Electronic Arts in November for $300m to help it enter the market. EA makes the best-selling Fifa 10 game and its numerous predecessors.“We think FIFA Superstars marks a turning point in the social gaming industry. We’re connecting real-life passions to online activity,” Sebastien de Halleux, Playfish’s co-founder, said. “Around 750m people watched the last World Cup and Facebook has 450m people online, [so] we feel there’s a natural overlap here.”The strategy game lets players train and manage teams and build stadiums. Using EA’s licence from Fifa, football’s governing body, footballers can be bought and sold and players can choose to challenge friends or take on teams from the World Cup or the UK’s Premier League.EA makes money from players buying credits to play extra games or acquire better players, to win promotion in their leagues. “With all due respect to farms, pets and mobs, the intellectual property has not been that engaging or interesting for me to date,” said Peter Moore, head of EA Sports. “Finding [Spanish midfielder] Xavi in a [player] pack is a whole different story from putting a kitty cat in your house.”Gareth Davis, head of games at Facebook, said higher production values were coming to social gaming, while the main attraction of letting casual gamers play against people they know was being complemented by greater realism.“What we are seeing is the next generation of social games coming to Facebook; it’s a whole new league, where Facebook has real people connecting with real friends and their real-world soccer teams,” he says.But the growth of gaming on Facebook is also creating tensions around the introduction of its virtual currency, Facebook Credits, and the removal in March of notification messages used by companies to entice players to return to the games.Additional reporting by David Gelles"
155;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BT bounces back with dividend pledge;;Ian Livingston’s annus horribilis looks like being a one-off.This time last year BT’s chief executive apologised to shareholders as the UK’s leading fixed-line phone group recorded only its second pre-tax loss since privatisation and slashed its dividend.On Thursday, at BT’s full-year results for 2009-10, he pleased investors by pledging to increase the company’s dividend over the next three years.Mr Livingston was desperate to avoid triumphalism. “We are trying to build a better business,” he said. “I think we are making progress, but there is still a lot more to do.”Shareholders liked Mr Livingston’s message that he is managing the business for cash.He outlined how £1.9bn ($2.8bn) of free cash flow in 2009-10 had been used to lift the dividend 6 per cent, cut net debt by £1bn and reduce BT’s pension deficit through a £525m payment. He is aiming to build on this performance over the coming years.BT’s improving fortunes were encapsulated by the results of BT Global Services, the unit responsible for the problems in 2008-09.Global Services, which serves the telecommunications needs of multinationals, pushed BT to a loss in 2008-09 because of over-optimistic assumptions about the profitability of some of its contracts.Mr Livingston’s efforts to stabilise the unit have enjoyed some success. Global Services recorded £177m of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the fourth quarter of 2009-10, compared with a £1.3bn loss in the same period a year earlier.The unit’s turnround is progressing, but it is far from complete. Global Services consumed £443m of cash in 2009-10, compared with £847m in 2008-09.Mr Livingston highlighted growth opportunities for the unit in Asia, and insisted BT would only pursue profitable contracts.BT expects Global Services to start generating cash in 2011-12, and to record revenue growth in 2012-13, but some analysts were sceptical.Jonathan Groocock, at Investec, said: “The jury is still out on whether they can deliver growth and the move to positive cash flow.”Analysts were happier with BT’s broad assault on costs. Underlying labour costs fell 16 per cent in 2009-10, as the company cut its staff and contractors by 20,000 to 128,000.BT expects to cut operating costs by £900m in 2010-11 and Tony Chanmugam, finance director, underlined his appetite to grind out savings. For example, he admitted that BT had been a “soft touch” on some suppliers.Cost-cutting will be partially offset by £200m of investment in 2010-11, much of it at BT Retail, the unit serving consumers.This summer, BT will try to boost its fledgling pay-television service by unleashing a price war on live premiership football games.BT wants to undercut British Sky Broadcasting on the price of watching live games on Sky Sports 1 and 2 and ESPN by offering them to customers for less than £20 a month.Gavin Patterson, head of BT Retail, said the unit would offer a “sharp, sharp price” for the live football, although he acknowledged that Sky was likely to respond.Citi analysts said BT’s football pricing could initially be a loss leader, although they added that an intervention by Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, could eventually make it profitable.BT is also looking to put Sky under pressure in the broadband market, along with other rivals such as TalkTalk.It outlined plans for a big expansion of its superfast broadband network, which is based on optical fibre, so that it runs past 66 per cent of homes by 2015.Under the original proposal, the network was due to run past 40 per cent of homes by mid-2012.BT hopes to poach customers from rivals by offering superior broadband download speeds of up to 40 megabits per second.The strategy could also encourage rivals to use BT’s wholesale fibre product so that they can offer their own customers the same speeds.However, some analysts said BT’s statement that the expanded network will cost £2.5bn looked conservative. Credit Suisse analysts said the cost could be £3.8bn.But Mr Livingston acknowledged that one matter was not fully under his control: BT’s pension issues.In February, BT disclosed that its pension fund deficit stood at £9bn at December 31 2008 under an actuarial valuation.The company announced an agreement with its retirement fund trustees under which BT will make annual top-up payments of at least £500m over 17 years to fix the deficit.BT also disclosed that the pensions watchdog had expressed “substantial concerns” at elements of the agreement, and Standard & Poor’s subsequently cut BT’s credit rating to triple B-, one notch above junk status.However, Mr Livingston underlined his determination not to be knocked off course by the pension issues. He signalled that if BT and the trustees could not reach agreement with the pension watchdog, they were prepared to appeal to an independent review panel.
156;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investors ignore EA’s digital dividend;;Shares in Electronic Arts fell nearly 6 per cent on Wednesday after the video game publisher issued a cautious outlook for its current fiscal year.Investors seemed to overlook the fact that it is trying to manage expectations with more conservative estimates these days and that its digital business appears to be taking off.EA’s digital revenues grew 33 per cent in its fiscal year ending March 31 to $570m, or 14 per cent of total revenues. The Silicon Valley company expects growth of 30 per cent in the current year to reach its target of $750m in digital revenues.The biggest component of its digital business is mobile games, where it is the industry leader with revenues north of $200m.Eric Brown, chief financial officer, told me EA was seeing the highest growth rates in digital coming from downloadable content on consoles, with the rest of sales coming from subscription and social networking-based games.EA bought Playfish, the number two player in social gaming, last November for up to $400m and its latest title, Hotel City, became a Top 15 game on Facebook in its first two weeks.“We’re now bringing to bear the high-quality EA brands like Fifa,” he said – Fifa Superstars will be the first major EA franchise to feature on Facebook and is in beta testing this month.Analysts are generally positive about EA’s digital progress.“EA is likely making the right steps in its transition from a packaged-goods focused video game publisher to a digital, direct-to-consumer developer,” said Todd Greenwald of Signal Hill in a research note.However, he added: “We prefer to wait on the sidelines while this slow-going and painful transition progresses.”Mr Greenwald is sceptical EA can achieve its $750m target, with more than 50 per cent of digital revenues coming from slow-growing mobile, advertising and Pogo casual gaming. He believed Playfish was running into numerous hurdles on Facebook, with its limited notifications ability driving monthly active users down significantly and the use of Facebook credits, a virtual currency, driving costs up.Michael Pachter and Edward Woo at Wedbush Morgan Securities were more bullish.“The digital opportunity continues to be the story…the company’s investment has finally begun to bear fruit,” they said in a note.They highlighted how EA would achieve incremental digital revenues for each of its major franchises on top of the sales of their packaged goods versions.For example, in the case of Fifa, apart from the disc-based Fifa World Cup 2010 , Fifa 10 Ultimate Team was driving microtransactions on Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network, there was Fifa for the iPhone and other handsets, Fifa Superstars for Facebook and an online subscription Fifa game in Korea.With digital, there is no used-games secondary market to deal with, where gamers trading-in and buying second-hand games sucks away revenues from publishers.EA has even found a way to monetise this market digitally. Its new Online Pass programme for EA Sports titles gives buyers of the disc-based game a registration code for online services. Buyers of the used games will be able to access these for a short trial period, but must pay $10 for online game play and access to other features on a permanent basis.The industry as a whole is moving towards online digital distribution, but EA is pushing the hardest and coming up with the greatest amount of innovation.
157;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-05-12T17:27:19Z;Wall St sees steady rise after strong results;;"US stock prices climbed steadily higher on Wednesday as investors took comfort in signs of receding European sovereign debt risk following the resolution of the UK election and Spain’s announcement of a new austerity plan.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 1.4 per cent at 1,171.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4 per cent to 10,896.91 and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.1 per cent higher at 2,425.02.The Vix index, a measure of volatility, was down 9.2 per cent to 25.71.Scott Armiger, vice-president and portfolio manager at Delaware-based Christiana Bank & Trust, said the market was close to being fully valued based on the earnings outlook. “We don’t see a lot of progress in the S&P 500 over the next quarter or two,” he said.Morgan Stanley lost 2 per cent to $27.80 on reports that US investigators were probing whether the bank misled investors about mortgage derivative products it sold and sometimes bet against. The bank said it had not been contacted by any investigators.Mr Armiger, whose portfolio is underweight on financials, said: “The big investment banks are doing okay because of the low borrowing rates but they are not doing much lending. We’re not excited about the sector.”Bank of America fell 0.5 per cent to $17.07, AIG lost 3.5 per cent to $41.40, but Goldman Sachs was 3.7 per cent higher at $147.20.Department store chain Macy’s rallied 3.4 per cent to $24.70 on strong first-quarter results, boosted by rising revenues.Net income was 5 cents per share, compared with a loss of 21 cents per share a year earlier and average analyst expectations of a 4 cent per share profit.The company maintained the full-year earnings forecast it issued last month for annual earnings of $1.75 to $1.80 per share.Disney pulled back 1.8 per cent to $35.13, in spite of its first-quarter results beating analyst expectations.Its television business recorded lower-than-expected results but the movie division was
stronger-than-expected, boosted by the success of its Alice in Wonderland 3D blockbuster. The group’s second-quarter net income was $953m, or 48 cents per share, compared with $613m, or 33 cents a share, in the previous year. It topped average analyst expectations of 45 cents per share.Intel, the microchip maker, rose 3.6 per cent to $23.09 after a bullish investor day on Tuesday.The company said it expected to double its earnings in the next few years as it pushes into new fast-growing segments, namely smartphones and TVs. Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, also said he was “highly confident” that it would achieve its financial goals for the current quarter.Electronic Arts retreated 5.8 per cent to $17.71, making it one of the day’s biggest fallers, after the video game company lowered its first-quarter and full-year outlook for 2011 in a restatement, disappointing some investors who had expected a rise.Pharma group Merck was 0.4 per cent higher at $33.64 after its annual research and development briefing day. “Merck remains our top pick in US major pharma [sector], given relative valuation, strong pipeline, and near-term synergy potential,” said Anthony Butler, an analyst at Barclays Capital. “We would be buyers at these levels.”Industrials stocks performed well across the sector. Caterpillar, which makes construction and mining equipment, was up 3.2 per cent to $68.15 and Deere & Co, the maker of agricultural equipment rallied 2.8 per cent to $61.14.Consumer staples stocks were higher. Tyson Foods, a meat production company, rose 0.6 per cent to $18.13. Conagra, which supplies vegetables to restaurants added 1.6 per cent to $24.74 and Mead Johnson, which makes children’s food, rose 2.3 per cent to $52.42.The rise in gold prices helped lift metals producers. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold added 3.9 per cent to $73 and Newmont Mining rose 0.9 per cent to $58.71.Pharmaceutical distributor McKesson gained 4.5 per cent to $69.06 as the stock was raised to “buy” by Goldman Sachs."
158;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-05-09T22:21:08Z;Social gaming industry consolidates;;The multi-billion dollar industry that has built up around “social gaming” – casual video games played on social networking websites – is rapidly consolidating.Hundreds of small software development studios have sprung up in the past two years to create the games, but a few large companies – led by Zynga and Playdom – are beginning to dominate the market.Playdom has bought at least five companies since August, including Three Melons, a 50-person studio based in Buenos Aires, and Merscom, a small company from North Carolina.Zynga is also cherry-picking small studios and has bought two in recent months. “Doing acquisitions is definitely part of how we grow,” said Vish Makhijini, Zynga’s chief operating officer. “To date, it’s mostly been about talent, not buying market share.”Success for all social game companies has become more elusive in recent months as it has become harder to promote games through viral marketing. Facebook, the social networking site, and stopped letting games send updates to users.To launch a successful game , companies must either promote it from within existing hit titles, or spend heavily advertising on Facebook.“The viral channels have been morphed, and in some instances tamped down,” said Christa Quarles, Playdom’s chief financial officer. “You need a lot of ad dollars to get your game first played.”This has been especially tough on cash-poor startups, which are increasingly looking to be acquired rather than make it on their own.One senior executive at a leading social games company said in recent months several small developers have approached him looking to be bought. Compared with just a few months ago, he said, it seems the smaller developers are more interested in being acquired than running long-term businesses.“What’s the right endgame for these little companies?” said Charles Hudson, who sold his social game start-up, Serious Business, to Zynga – the largest social game company – last year. “Is life for an independent going to be as much fun in the future as it was in the past?”Electronic Arts, the second largest developer of console games, got into the social games market last year with its $400m acquisition of Playfish, the UK studio that had risen to become the second largest social games company.Consolidation is likely to continue among social games companies large and small in the year to come.Ms Quarles said: “Developers want to see their game touch as many people as they can, so they’re looking for partners who can do that.”
159;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-05-07T02:43:58Z;Activision expects new game to be bestseller;;The head of Activision Blizzard said on Thursday that a revolt at the studio responsible for the record-breaking Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 would not adversely affect the world’s biggest video game publisher.Bobby Kotick, chief executive, also forecast that the next instalment of the Call of Duty franchise – Black Ops – would outsell Halo: Reach when the two blockbuster action games are released in the autumn, and would become the biggest video game of the year.Activision released first-quarter figures well ahead of analysts’ expectations and its own guidance.The south California-based company reported revenues of $714m, for earnings per share of 9 cents, against its forecast in February for $525m sales and profits of 2 cents a share.In mid-April it said it was tracking ahead of its outlook, leading to analyst expectations of sales of $563m and earnings per share of 4 cents.Activision said its better-than-expected performance was due to “strong global consumer demand” for Call of Duty and Blizzard Entertainment’s World of Warcraft online game.Activision shares have fallen 12 per cent in the past month over concerns about the defection of the creators of Modern Warfare 2, which has generated more than $1.5bn in revenues. About a quarter of the staff at its Infinity Ward studio have left following the firing of its studio heads two months ago.The company has alleged in a lawsuit that Vincent Zampella and Jason West were trying to “steal the studio” and had secretly met top executives of its rival Electronic Arts. Since their dismissal, the two have launched a studio called Respawn and announced the backing of EA for a new game in the action genre.The former executives are suing Activision for damages and unpaid royalties, while 38 Infinity Ward employees are also suing the company for allegedly delaying and withholding more than $54m in royalties for Modern Warfare 2. They claim they are being “held hostage” by the publisher.Mr Kotick said the company had no choice but to sack the executives for insubordination and breach of contract, but the franchise would not be affected.“It’s a magnet for talent, we have a lot of other [studio] resources, we don’t think we will see a blip,” he said.Activision has alternated development of Call of Duty games with its Treyarch studio, developer of this year’s Black Ops.“I’m comfortable Call of Duty: Black Ops will be the biggest video game of the year,” he added. The title is available on multiple platforms, while Halo: Reach is exclusive to Microsoft’s Xbox 360 console.
160;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-05-02T16:14:13Z;Real-world battle clouds game publishers’ successes;;Video gamers will get their first chance on Monday to engage one another in Halo: Reach – the year’s most anticipated title – while an acrimonious real-world battle rages over the action genre.The latest Halo game becomes available in an online multiplayer beta version, ahead of its full release in the autumn, and just four days after its developer Bungie announ-ced a 10-year alliance with the leading publisher Activision Blizzard.The deal was good news for Activision which has suffered the bad publicity in recent weeks of an uprising at its Infinity Ward studio, home of last year’s best-selling game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.The developments illustrate how the action genre and hard-core gamers still dominate the industry, despite the growth of more casual gaming and the success of the Nintendo Wii.The record revenues generated by the Halo, Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty franchises have created rich rewards in royalties for the developers. But they have also generated tensions in relationships with their publishers. The heads of Infinity Ward – Vincent Zampella and Jason West – were fired by Activision in March for alleged insubordination and breach of contract. They have since said they will set up their own studio – Respawn Entertainment – and a distribution deal with Activision’s arch-rival, Electronic Arts.The Infinity Ward executives denied the allegations and are suing Activision for damages and unpaid royalties of more than $36m.In a countersuit, Activision alleged Mr West and Mr Zampella had schemed to “steal the studio” and made a secret trip to meet senior EA executives.Last week, 38 Infinity Ward employees also sued Activision for allegedly delaying and withholding more than $54m in royalties for Modern Warfare 2. They claimed they were being “held hostage” by the publisher and analysts interpreted the move as a tactic by Activision to prevent them defecting to Respawn.Modern Warfare 2 surpassed Grand Theft Auto IV and Halo 3 as the most successful entertainment launch of all time when it was released last November. It recorded $402m in sales on its first day, according to Guinness World Records, and has generated revenues of more than $1.5bn for Activision.Halo: Reach is the last title in the franchise to be made by Bungie, which originally developed Halo, was bought by Microsoft in 2000 and then regained its independence in 2007 at the expense of handing over future Halo games to a Microsoft subsidiary.Harold Ryan, head of Bungie, says the studio expects Halo: Reach will be “the greatest game of all time” and he has no qualms about having its next planned action-genre game published by Activision.“This is a great deal that we have been working on for over nine months, the timing is unfortunate with all the other [Infinity Ward] stuff going on,” he says.Bungie’s independent status means Activision will avoid any possible royalty wrangles and defections it has suffered with in-house Infinity Ward. But with Bungie owning the intellectual property, Activision’s earnings potential should be more limited than for the Call of Duty franchise it owns.“This is going to deliver operating-income margins greater than 20 per cent to Activision,” insists Thomas Tippl, Activision chief operating officer.“Activision has tarnished its reputation with the developer community with all these headlines,” says Michael Pachter, Wedbush Morgan video game analyst, but he says the level of press attention is unusual.These kind of moves have always characterised the industry, he points out. To complete a circle, Mr West and Mr Zampella’s creation of Respawn joins them back up with EA, where they worked at another studio making its Medal of Honor games, before breaking away to form Infinity Ward in 2002.
161;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-04-30T18:25:54Z;Lara Croft escapes console in latest adventure;;Gamers looking to play the next version of the Lara Croft computer game will not be lining up at a store when it launches, but logging on to download the title over the internet.The next iteration of the game franchise is to be released as an internet download only, as Square Enix becomes the latest games publisher to tap the growing consumer appetite for playing games online.Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is to be released in the next few months, priced at about £10 ($15) in the UK, and representing a significant revamp of the 13-year franchise.“We wanted to promote new games for new markets. The adventure series for Lara Croft will be more arcade-like, with the camera further away, more action and the ability to play characters other than Lara,” said Phil Rogers, chief executive of Square Enix Europe.It is the first Lara Croft title to be released since Square Enix of Japan took over Eidos a year ago, gaining ownership of one of the UK’s most famous games franchises. Mr Rogers said they were targeting a new audience of casual gamers who want to “snack” on games for a short period, rather than immersing themselves for hours at a time in an expensive console game.A revamp is necessary. The last Lara Croft game, Tomb Raider: Underworld, released in 2008, had lower sales than expected. Crystal Dynamics, the Square Enix studio that developed it was forced to lay off staff and Toby Gard, co-creator of the game, left the company.A number of computer games publishers have been rushing into online games. Electronic Arts is developing online versions of most of its games franchises and last year paid $400m for Playfish, which makes games for online social networks including Facebook.The World of Warcraft online role-playing game – which has more than 11.5m subscribers – accounts for nearly a third of revenues at Activision Blizzard, the world’s biggest games group.Codemasters of the UK, which recently saw Reliance Big Entertainment of India take a 50 per cent stake in the company, said it planned to invest heavily in online games, creating web versions of titles such as its Ashes Cricket game.This year, EA predicted a 3 per cent fall in industry sales of packaged games but 26 per cent growth for digital and online games.“2008 was the peak in terms of sales of boxed products. Although we will see a new generation of games consoles coming out in 2013 or 2014, we wouldn’t expect the new cycle to reach the same highs,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, lead games analyst at Screen Digest. “All games companies need to switch onto online to maintain sales.”Mr Harding-Rolls estimates 38 per cent of western games revenues could come from online sales by 2014.Online gaming could also help companies move into markets such as China, where widespread piracy has often made publishers reluctant to launch boxed games.In spite of the stampede online, it is still unclear how the economics of online games will stack up. They tend to be much cheaper and quicker to produce than console versions.“We were working on it for months rather than years and had a team of 20 people rather than 200,” Mr Rogers said. However, they are priced much lower too.“Online games will reach more people, but the big question will be whether that audience can be monetised to the same extent,” Mr Harding-Rolls said. “The answer is probably no. Online is a very fragmented market with a precedent of a lot of free access. Online gamers will not spend the same amount as a hardcore gamer [would have] in the golden era of packaged console games.”Tellingly, Square Enix is not planning to stop making packaged games any time soon. “We still fully believe in console games and will not give up selling disks,” Mr Rogers said.
162;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-04-08T03:12:39Z;Tiger Woods leads EA Sports online;;"There are new beginnings for both Tiger Woods and Electronic Arts this week as he tees off at the Masters today and EA tries a radical reworking of its strategy for PC sports games.The free-to-play Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online just launched represents the first EA PC sports title to be moved online. The rest may follow in short order as EA abandons physical media, says Peter Moore, EA Sports president. His thoughts on piracy, virtual goods and the trials of Tiger after the jump:EA has continued to support Tiger Woods despite his widely reported problems, what was your thinking?We are now in the 12th year of a relationship with Tiger – almost since he left Stanford [University] – and he has been a tremendous part of our business for that period of time. He lives in Orlando where our studio is, he’s a gamer, our games are about simulating the world’s greatest athletes on the field of play and golf is no different. He’s the world’s greatest golfer until somebody proves otherwise and whilst we’re very sympathetic and very sensitive to the challenges he’s gone through in his personal life, our relationship with him is rooted in the golf and he’s embedded in our game rather than simply being an arms-length endorser which I think he was for many of the other companies that have since said goodbye to him, there’s never been any wavering in our support of him as a golfer.Is this a testing ground for you in terms of getting PC games online and trying a new strategy here?It’s a very different experience having to boot up your Xbox 360, load the game and play on a wide-screen TV, this is built to attract people who wouldn’t ordinarily call themselves core video gamers. What we are seeing is people who are actual golfers, that are 40 years of age plus, affluent, have less time on their hands, love the game of golf, play the game of golf – 90 per cent of them responded in our beta survey saying I actually go out on the links and play and we see it as a real complement to our core offering.
This is probably the future of how we continue to grow our business in a world where packaged goods media is flat to declining, how do you bring more people in who wouldn’t ordinarily be customers in the current business model? Having the free experience is very different and it can also be dangerous – our job is to bring people in with no barrier to price or equipment, only a very small download and you are up and running and it’s a good experience streaming right out of your browser.How much is piracy a problem and the fact that PC game buyers are moving to the console because they prefer the controllers?There are a number of factors and piracy is an issue. [Tiger Woods on the PC] over the last seven or eight years has declined every single year as people migrated to the console, but we still wanted to offer PC gamers an experience without us having to quite frankly lose money , and that’s what we were doing in the last three years of shipping CD-Roms for PCs and experiencing the piracy issues and sales that had declined from a peak of 8-900,000 units down to a couple of hundred thousand units, with no decline in development and marketing costs. So we said two years ago we’re looking at different ways to bring sport to the PC and today is the first day of the future of what I think is a very entertaining, simple to play, inexpensive bite-sized experience.If it’s a success, what other sports will you look to move online? Golf looks the easiest to do in terms of keyboard controls.Golf was the obvious one because first, we have the greatest IP and we’ve been the dominant player, secondly, there’s less going on when you look at the screen, the keyboard is dealing with a single individual. We are launching Fifa [soccer] online around the time of the World Cup, albeit it being a slightly different model – there is a client download because of the size and scale and a lot of the game mechanic is a manager-type mechanic. But we will be looking at ways to bring all our franchises to the PC, and you can expect to see different takes on our core console games on the PC in the coming years. We are still shipping physical media for our Fifa franchise this year but it’s the only franchise that still has that and that’s to accommodate the globalisation of our Fifa business which is obviously very strong, but there will come a day when all of our PC games franchises will be totally online and that’s probably not too far in the future.What feedback have you had on sales of virtual goods, are there considerable revenues to be earned there?It’s going to be a slower burn than normal, compared to our core games which have a huge launch and then drop off pretty radically by week three or four. With the open beta, you could earn dollars but it wasn’t real money. Today it’s full commercialisation. We’re watching the numbers of people who are signing up to subscribe – at $9.99 a month or $59.99 for a full year – and the early metrics off the server show that people are already subscribing on Day One and those are guys who had a good experience on the open beta.
The other slice of the business model is microtransactions so you can go in and buy clubs and other equipment, buy power-ups and individual courses and we have buckets of points that you can buy that will fuel that."
163;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-04-07T21:52:55Z;When star power finds the rough;;As Tiger Woods prepares to tee off at The Masters on Thursday, the humbled athlete is not the only one counting the cost of his fall from grace. The 34-year-old golfer’s reputation as a clean-living and dedicated sportsman and husband was undone when his infidelities were spilled across television, newspapers and internet sites in the wake of a mysterious car accident at his home in late November.Mr Woods’ success on the course had enabled him to line up lucrative sponsorship deals off of it, with brands including Accenture, Nike, Gillette, Electronic Arts and Gatorade signing him up to lucrative sponsorship deals. Some estimates suggest that the arrangements made him the world’s first sports star to make $1bn in career earnings.But as his life became embroiled in scandal, those companies also took direct financial hits, from having to commission and produce new advertising to the costs of their own public relations campaigns explaining their actions in dropping the golfer and legal fees. According to a study by Christopher Knittel and Victor Stango, economists at the University of California, Davis, the stock market value of all the companies endorsed by Mr Woods collectively lost $5bn-$12bn by the middle of December.Of course, companies do not need a celebrity relationship to experience reputational damage. Toyota estimates that its global recall of cars this year had a direct cost of about $2bn (€1.5bn, £1.3bn). That figure does not take into account potential lost future sales, or Toyota’s own stock price decline, which has knocked Y1,673bn ($17.8bn, €13.3bn, £11.7bn) off its market value even after a strong rebound in the past month.The size of such losses is helping to fuel a growing debate about whether a corporate reputation is insurable – and about what exactly it is that a company would want to insure.In the wake of the Tiger Woods scandal, DeWitt Stern, the insurance broker, saw an opportunity to publicise a product it had launched to cover reputational risk, including how to deal with celebrity endorsers becoming engulfed in scandal. More recently, Lloyd’s of London, the insurance market, held a conference on how to manage reputational risk and what cover – if any – might be available.Reputation is a slippery issue not only because it can be hard to define exactly what it is until it has taken a knock, but also because people – and companies – can trade just as much off edgy or wild reputations as they can off good, clean ones.When Kate Moss, the supermodel, was caught taking cocaine in 2005, many of the brands she then represented, such as H&M, the retailer, ran a mile – but other, differently positioned names, such as Sir Philip Green’s Top Shop, soon took her on.“Kate Moss is an interesting example,” says Mark Borkowski, who runs an eponymous public relations agency. “The teenage brands fell apart, but Virgin and some other edgier brands moved straight in.”Companies are increasingly recognising that reputation is an important and valuable asset that is vulnerable and volatile, according to Anthony Fitzsimmons, chairman of Reputability, a consultancy focused on reputation and crisis strategy, risk and management.“Reputation can be an organisation’s most valuable intangible asset, though it appears in few balance sheets except as [goodwill in] acquisitions,” he says. “People are generally aware of their brand values, but many have not worked out what matters most when things are going wrong. Few have made a systematic analysis of what might damage their reputation, let alone worked out how to make their reputation intrinsically strong through difficult times.”However, Mr Fitzsimmons says that in discussions with insurers and reinsurers over a number of years he has been unable to find a way of protecting the full financial value of a reputation. “So far, the conclusion has always been that to cover the value of a corporate reputation in any meaningful sense is virtually impossible,” he says.Part of the problem is how to assess what a company is able to cover. There are the direct costs – such as product recalls, PR spending and lost profits – that might be relatively simple to work out. But what of the potential lost future sales from the long-term reputational damage? How should anyone assess how a company would have performed in an alternative future that has been forfeited?If markets are efficient – a theory with fewer adherents than ever after the market turmoil of the past two years – then the value of what a company will do in future should be reflected in its current share price. But even if markets were efficient, there is still the problem of when an insurer or investor measures what has been lost.The University of California, Davis study took the difference between the value of Mr Woods’ corporate partners on the day of the crash and a day in mid-December that was one week after he announced his indefinite break from golf. An arbitrary call.Similarly with Toyota, the shares had lost Y3,173bn at their worst a little more than one month after the first recall was announced in January, but have since recovered almost half that loss. In a year’s time, they might be worth more than before the recalls. But determining which part of the stock’s move in price is to do with reputation and which part is to do with the broader economy or market is a further complicating factor.None of this has stopped insurers beginning to offer some sort of cover for reputational risk. Companies such as AIG – now called Chartis – have for a few years been augmenting traditional Directors & Officers policies with extras such as “spin-doctor cover” to pay for the publicists and brand consultants needed if a company’s reputation takes a hit.Dan Trueman at Kiln, a Lloyd’s of London insurer that is involved in the DeWitt Stern product, says that because companies have become increasingly concerned about insuring intangible assets such as reputation, insurers have focused on what they can insure. “The risks that keep company directors awake at night are no longer about the tangible assets, such as a building burning down,” he says. “It is much more about the intangible – reputations, moving data around, intellectual property and counterfeiters.”The most important costs from all these risks are in the short-term loss of revenues that often result, along with legal and communications costs – and not the muddier concepts of goodwill or share price.“The maximum indemnity period tends to be a year, but most important is the first few days, including the PR and crisis management,” he says. “The longer term does not matter nearly so much as continuing to generate revenues in the near term. Most clients only want six months’ cover.”Mr Trueman’s clients have included not only makers of things, such as pharmaceutical and technology companies, but also law firms and a private school in Australia worried about unsuitable people slipping through safety and criminal checks to work with children.But the heightened awareness of reputational risks and the short-term nature of the insurance are, in fact, symptoms of the same condition: the multi-faceted, ever-present modern media. This means that reputational crises can erupt and spread quickly, but if combatted well can burn out just as fast.“In the digital world, everyone can comment on your product or brand immediately and you have to be aware of what people are saying about your brand,” says Mr Borkowski. “There will be a time when Twitter gets a billion followers [and] that’s a huge conversation. As a company you have to have the resources to monitor and respond to that – and quickly.”
164;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-03-17T15:01:46Z;Valley View: Video game makers excited by new audience;;Are they growing tobacco crops on Farmville (that game is so darned addictive)? Is selling a real guitar with a video game really going to revive the music genre? So we now have 173m daily data points from Madden NFL being played online, but what does it all mean?These were the kinds of questions and conversations I was listening to last week as the video game industry gathered for the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.It was a fascinating dialogue. The industry is the most dynamic in the media sector – having to deal with new technologies, platforms, genres and audiences.Frankly, it is being pulled in different directions as gaming splinters and spreads and publishers try to understand what appeals to the new demographics of players.The traditional publishers are having to work out strategies for social gaming, virtual worlds, cloud gaming, new motion controllers from Microsoft and Sony and new platforms such as the large-screen Nintendo DS XL and Apple iPad tablet, which both launch in the next month.The huge numbers of casual players indulging in simple games on social networking sites and spending money on virtual goods have caught the industry by surprise. Facebook has more than 400m members and 32m a day are now playing the farming social game, Farmville. It was developed by 11 people in just five weeks.Farmville is owned by Zynga, the leading social gaming publisher. Electronic Arts bought a rival, Playfish, in November to get some skin in the game.Video game publishers are excited by the new audiences attracted to gaming by platforms such as the Nintendo Wii, with its motion controller, but they have yet to work out what makes these non-core gamers tick.Their tastes seem faddish. Fitness is popular at the moment with Wii Fit and its balance board, while EA has sold millions of its EA Sports Active game for the Wii.But the casual audience’s liking for the music genre – principally Guitar Hero and Rock Band – has faded badly, with sales halving in the US last year. This was despite Rock Band introducing a Beatles edition and the Guitar Hero franchise being extended to club music with DJ Hero and its turntable mixer accessory.At GDC, I was shown a new Guitar-Hero type game with a controller that doubled as a real guitar, when a string damping device was lowered and it was connected to an amplifier.While Guitar Hero is basically a rhythm game where players hit buttons in time with the music, this new game allowed them to move on to playing real chords. The makers, Seven45 Studios, claimed their research showed many people were tired of the rhythm games and wanted something that taught them real skills.The acid test will be when the game goes on sale in the autumn – are casual gamers prepared for the realism of calloused hands from holding down difficult chords.Greater realism is something developers are always striving for, but players do not always welcome if it makes the game too difficult and less satisfying.Sony showed off its new motion controller at the show, but publishers seemed more excited about Microsoft’s Project Natal, a motion-sensing system that means players can take part in a game by standing in front of a camera that detects their every movement. They believe this could set off a second wave of console game adoption by non-core gamers.In the meantime, they are paying more attention to their more predictable and faithful hard-core gamers. For example, the analysis of 173m data instances from a day’s play in the 6m-selling Madden NFL revealed that there was an unrealistically high chance of success when defenders tried to break up play and make interceptions.The developers were able to tweak the game to make this harder to do. Authenticity for the fans was also improved by comparing run-blocking trends with those in current game action in the NFL and adjusting the game to be more like the real thing.Cloud gaming was given a launch date at GDC when OnLive announced its service would begin in June. OnLive’s ability to serve full console-style games over an internet connection to TVs promises to be a boon to publishers, but could disintermediate video game retailers such as Gamestop and the console makers themselves.Yoichi Wada, chief executive of the Japanese publisher Square Enix, told me the networking of games and the growth of gaming devices beyond the traditional consoles threatened to be very disruptive.”This is a very interesting time period: the components of the video game industry are being reorganised,” he said. ”A large amount of consolidation can take place and the main players can be replaced.”Similarly, gaming could be dividing into new and significant sub-sectors with its own leaders. Facebook could already be considered as significant a games platform as the Xbox, Wii and PlayStation combined.
165;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-03-12T19:01:38Z;Xbox regains lead in console battle;;Microsoft’s Xbox 360 led console sales in the US last month for the first time in more than two years as Nintendo continued to suffer supply problems for the Wii.Microsoft sold 422,000 Xbox 360s in February compared to sales of 398,000 for the Wii and 360,000 for Sony’s PlayStation 3, according to research company NPD.Nintendo told the Financial Times last month it had been operating “hand-to-mouth” in supplying retailers with products in January and February after 3.8m Wiis were sold in the US in December.“On the Wii hardware side, we are back to a situation where demand is exceeding supply and we’re going to be in that situation through to the end of March,” said Reggie Fils-Aimé, president of Nintendo of America.However, analysts were sceptical that supply was Nintendo’s only issue.“We believe that the problem lies deeper than that, as sales of staple titles such as Wii Fit with Balance Board and Wii Play were well below historical levels,” analysts Wedbush Morgan said.“Unlike the PS3, with multiple high-profile exclusives and the newly announced Move controller, and the Xbox 360, with [the] Project Natal [controller], the Wii lacks an important upcoming catalyst,” they said.Microsoft’s Xbox was the top selling console for the first time since September 2007, when its exclusive title, Halo 3, was released. PS3 sales were up 30 per cent on a year earlier in spite of reports of supply problems at retail level. Wii sales were down 47 per cent on February 2009 and overall hardware sales were down 20 per cent on a year earlier, while software suffered a 15 per cent fall.Software sales have fallen in 11 of the past 12 months in the US due to a lack of blockbuster titles and lower spending by recession-hit consumers and a collapse in sales in the music genre.“Honestly, I had expected the industry to perform somewhat better this month,” said Anita Frazier, an NPD analyst. “Nonetheless, strong new releases and Easter gift buying bodes well for industry performance in March.”Major releases in March include Battlefield Bad Company 2 from Electronic Arts, Square Enix’s Final Fantasy XIII and Sony’s God of War III. Take-Two’s Bioshock 2, set in an underwater dystopia called Rapture, was the top-selling game, with 750,000 sales in February of which 75 per cent were for the Xbox 360, NPD said.Sony this week unveiled its motion controller – the PlayStation Move – and said it would sell it with a camera and game for less than $100 this autumn.
166;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-03-10T20:47:31Z;OnLive’s ‘cloud’ gaming to rival console groups;;OnLive, a “cloud” video game service that challenges the dominance of traditional games consoles, said it would launch in the US in June.Steve Perlman, OnLive’s founder, told the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday that subscribers would be charged $15 a month for a service allowing them to play fully-featured games over the internet, without the need for a console.OnLive caused a stir with its potentially disruptive technology, which bypasses the need for the disk-based consoles made by Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony, when it emerged from seven years in “stealth mode” to demonstrate the service at the GDC last year.However, it is launching six months later than predicted. And the small adapter that will bring the service directly to the living-room television will not be available until later in 2010, meaning it will initially be available just on computers.Critics have questioned whether OnLive can build the infrastructure and offer the bandwidth needed for data-intensive games to run for large online audiences without time lags.Mr Perlman said the service would be available on June 17 to those registering early in the contiguous 48 US states, suggesting that a limited number of people would be allowed on its network as it developed and stress-tested the service.OnLive has been embraced by video game publishers, whose revenues are reduced in the traditional disk-based model as they pay a cut to retailers, royalties to console makers and lose out to piracy and second-hand trade.Games anticipated to be available at the launch of the service include Electronic Arts’ Mass Effect 2, Ubisoft’s Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands and 2K Games’ Borderlands.OnLive will allow instant access to online games, which players can buy or rent. Features include the ability to pause or save and then resume a game on a different device. It will also offer a built-in chat service.“We are opening the door to incredible experiences for gamers and enormous opportunities for developers and publishers,” said Mr Perlman.Rivals to OnLive have emerged over the past year including Gaikai, Otoy, Playcast Media and Transgaming. Electronic Arts is creating fully-featured online versions of existing console titles for the PC.
167;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-03-10T00:39:11Z;Real guitars offer new riff for music games;;Sales figures for music games have hit more than a few bum notes lately, but there may be life in the Guitar Hero/Rock Band genre yet.MTV Games announced on Tuesday there would be a Rock Band 3 later this year, implying a new distribution deal had been struck with Electronic Arts. Meanwhile, over at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, a new competitor emerged touting a video game with real instruments.Boston-based Seven45 Studios showed me an early version of their Power Gig: Rise of the SixString game due to be released in the autumn.At first look, it seems very derivative of Guitar Hero with the same cartoon guitar figures and coloured notes to hit in time with the beats.But, moving beyond the basic level where this is merely a rhythm game, gamers can play actual power chords on a controller that doubles as a real guitar.The controller can be plugged into an amplifier and switched to six-string electric guitar by putting a dampener muting the strings into a down position.The accessory is heavier and feels more solid than a Guitar Hero controller and actually looks and sounds like a real guitar.That shouldn’t be surprising given Seven45′s pedigree. It was born out of First Act, which sells affordable guitars through retailers such as Walmart, Target and Best Buy.Guitar Hero has inspired many players to take up real guitars, so Seven45 may be onto something in bridging the gap with its new device and game.It says it is negotiating with the major record labels for original content and the package will be priced competitively with regards to the bundles of its bigger rivals.The question remains whether there is enough consumer interest left in the genre for Seven45 to be successful.“Guitar Hero and Rock Band built a $4bn category in no time and we believe there’s still a very large consumer segment out there,” Jeff Walker, head of marketing, told me.“We’ve listened loud and clear to the music gamer that’s screaming for this type of product. There’s been a vocal segment that has said: ‘I’m playing these games for hours on end and I have no transferable skills for actually playing music.’”
168;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-02-10T23:55:08Z;Activision rocked by ‘Guitar Hero’ writedown;;Activision Blizzard, the world’s biggest video game publisher, announced a $409m writedown on Tuesday as its Guitar Hero franchise hit a sour note with consumers.Its move followed Electronic Arts’ disclosure on Monday that it had no current plans to distribute another title in its rival Rock Band series of games.The music genre, once a big growth driver for the video game industry, experienced a precipitous decline in 2009, with US sales halving from $1.4bn in 2008 to around $700m, according to industry analysts.Bobby Kotick, Activision chief executive, said the impairment charge, worth 19 cents a share, reflected “the reduction in our expectations for future cash flows for that [Guitar Hero] business”.“The casual consumer in video games did not purchase in the way we would have liked last year and I think you can expect that behaviour, in these difficult economic conditions, will continue,” he said, in a Financial Times interview.Mr Kotick said he was pleased with the launch of an expansion to the franchise – DJ Hero – which features club music and a turntable rather than the guitar accessory. He said it had got off to a good start as the highest grossing new intellectual property launched in 2009 and a DJ Hero 2 had been given the green light.Fans of Rock Band, which featured a Beatles edition last year, were left disappointed when no news was announced of an expected release of Rock Band 3 and a version featuring the band Green Day, during EA’s earnings call on Monday. Instead, the company said it was looking to reduce its lower-margin distribution business – it handles the title for the media company Viacom and developer Harmonix.Activision reported fourth-quarter results ahead of Wall Street expectations with revenues of $2.5bn and profits of 49 cents a share. Analysts expected sales of $2.23bn and earnings of 43 cents a share.Its quarter was dominated by the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in November, which had a record launch for a media property and has netted more than $1bn in sales at retail so far.The company announced an annual dividend of 15 cents a share and a $1bn buy-back of its stock. Its shares rose more than 6 per cent to $10.73 in extended trading in New York.However, Activision issued a cautious outlook, predicting lower sales this year of $4.4bn, down from $4.75bn in 2009 and below analyst forecasts of $4.84bn.
169;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-02-09T22:16:05Z;Coca-Cola and industrials help stocks rally;;Encouraging results from Coca-Cola and renewed optimism in the industrials sector helped US stocks bounce back yesterday.Reports of a rescue package for Greece also reassured investors who had feared the country’s fiscal problems could spark a wider crisis across the eurozone.The S&P 500 gained 1.3 per cent to 1,070.52, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.5 per cent to 10,058.64 and the Nasdaq was 1.2 per cent higher at 2,150.87.“The recent bearish charge appears to have run into a brick wall,” said Andrew Wilkinson, a senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “Rumour-driven or not, investors’ jitters were abruptly abandoned as traders began to put faith in some kind of practical resolution for Greek state finances.”Strong demand from China, Brazil and India helped Coca-Cola to offset declines in North America and post quarterly results in line with estimates. The soft-drinks maker also gained market share during the period, both in the carbonated and non-carbonated segments. The stock rose 2.6 per cent to $54.01.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, McDonald’s reported that sales had risen 2.6 per cent at restaurants open for more than a year. While revenues continued to decline in the US, sales rose in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Shares in McDonald’s the rose 1 per cent to $63.57.Caterpillar added to the market’s gains after Morgan Stanley boosted its rating on the world’s largest manufacturer of construction equipment to “overweight” from “underweight”. Analysts at the bank also upgraded the US industrial sector to “attractive” from “in-line”, citing stronger than expected order books. Caterpillar added 5.4 per cent to $53.53, while the S&P 500 industrials index rose 1.7 per cent.Monsanto, the world’s largest seed producer, also benefited from an upgrade and was up 2 per cent at $75.72. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised their rating on the group to “buy” from “neutral”, saying it was well-positioned to gain market share in US corn seed.It emerged that India’s government rejected the country’s first genetically modified food after protests by farmers. Monsanto had supplied the gene for the test vegetable, and the government’s decision to halt production was considered a blow to the group’s prospects for growth in India.NYSE Euronext climbed 5.1 per cent to $23.65 after the transatlantic exchange operator posted a higher profit for the last quarter than analysts had been expecting. Cost-cutting had helped offset declining trading volumes and a diminishing share of the equities market.ADC Telecommunications also surprised the market by reporting a quarterly profit. Analysts had expected the telephone equipment maker to break even. Its shares surged 21.4 per cent to $6.53.Electronic Arts weighed on the market, tumbling 8.8 per cent to $15.96, after the video game publisher gave a disappointing forecast for next year. The group, which is the world’s second-largest player in the sector, blamed its lowered guidance on the lack of blockbuster titles, poor demand in Europe and the adverse impact of foreign exchange movements.Pulte Homes, the country’s largest housebuilder, posted a smaller loss for the last quarter thanks to tax benefits. Revenues rose 5 per cent in the period but the results were worse than expected. Shares in the Michigan group lost 0.5 per cent to $11.08.In the pharmaceutical sector, Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, reported encouraging results from trials of a bone-strengthening treatment. After early strength, the shares lost 0.4 per cent to $57.21.While financial stocks rebounded from the previous session’s lows, the sector still lagged behind the market.Lincoln National, one of the country’s largest life insurers, climbed 4.3 per cent to $24.50 after reporting a higher-than-expected profit for the last quarter.The group suffered from investment losses in the financial crisis but was given a $950m cash injection by the government and has also raised additional funds through a share offering.
170;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-02-09T21:07:32Z;Video game sector seeks way out of inferno;;Electronic Arts warned the public that “Hell Awaits” in a 30-second TV commercial during American Football’s Super Bowl last Sunday.EA’s first Super Bowl ad refers to the video game publisher’s latest title, Dante’s Inferno, launched on Tuesday in the US.However, Dante’s allegory could equally apply to burned investors suffering from an industry embroiled in the flames of slumping sales.Activision Blizzard, the largest video game publisher reports quarterly earnings on Wednesday, but number-two Electronic Arts gave a pessimistic outlook when it presented third-quarter earnings on Monday, predicting a 3 per cent fall in worldwide industry sales of disc-based games.There are chances of salvation for the industry this year in the shape of the Apple iPad console, which was unveiled in recent weeks – as well as motion-sensing controllers for existing ones from Microsoft and Sony, and a strong line-up of games.EA also predicted digital and online sales would grow 26 per cent this year, lifting overall software sales by 8 per cent.However, excluding Nintendo, video game stocks fell by 9 per cent in January, according to an index compiled by analysts at Wedbush Morgan Securities.This came after weak holiday sales in the US and an 8 per cent fall in revenues for the US video game industry in 2009 to $19.66bn, according to NPD, a research firm.France’s Ubisoft has warned its revenues will be lower than forecast because of the weaker-than-expected performance of games titles such as Avatar, based on the 3D movie.It has also pushed back the launch of two games.Microsoft announced that year-on-year sales in the last quarter on the Xbox 360 and PC platforms had fallen by $295m, or 12 per cent.Sales of its consoles dropped 13 per cent as the group lacked attractions to lure buyers in the final quarter of 2009.For Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest video game publisher, sales of titles in its Guitar Hero franchise have been disappointing, as they have for the latest Tony Hawk game, in spite of its clever skateboard controller.Redemption for Activision has come in the shape of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, a blockbuster that has earned more than $1bn since its release in November.The company can expect its Blizzard division to do well with the next expansion of its World of Warcraft universe – Cataclysm – this year.Microsoft can take comfort in a 35 per cent increase in membership of its Xbox Live online service year on year in the last quarter and has high hopes for Project Natal – a motion-sensing add-on for the Xbox 360 arriving in November.Sony will introduce a similar peripheral controller this year and saw sales of its PlayStation 3 leap 87 per cent year on year in December to 1.36m units in the US, after a price cut.The Nintendo Wii sold 3.8m units in the US in December and benefited from strong sales of the Wii Sports Resort, Wii Fit Plus and New Super Mario Bros titles. Unlike the rest of the segment, the company’s shares rose 18 per cent in January.EA can console itself with the January performance of its acclaimed Mass Effect 2, a space adventure that sold more than 2m copies in its first week.With other big titles expected such as Sony’s God of War III, Take-Two’s Bioshock 2 and EA’s Fifa World Cup South Africa, a bullish Wedbush Morgan is predicting software sales will grow by at least 10 per cent this year.Publishers are benefiting from selling to a growing number of owners of present-generation consoles, with sales of the Wii, 360 and PS3 combined standing at more than 135m worldwide.Apple’s iPad, which will be available from March, will start from zero in terms of games, although existing iPhone games will work on it and developers are expected to jump on the chance to develop more.“This is a new beginning,” says Michel Guillemot, chief executive of the publisher Gameloft. “On a larger screen [which the iPad offers], you have more real estate to be able to press buttons, move fingers, throw grenades and a new category of gaming could emerge for this different form factor.”Clive Downie, head of marketing at iPhone developer ngmoco, expects the iPad to become more of a fixture in homes, given its larger size. “The iPad has raised the bar on Apple’s entry into the home as a gaming entity. This could signal a very interesting future in terms of Apple versus Sony and Microsoft within the home domain.”With most iPhone games selling for less than $10, the industry has to work out whether iPad games can move up in price and quality, making it a platform worth pursuing or one that leaves them, like Dante, in limbo for the time being.
171;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-02-09T00:27:04Z;Electronic Arts predicts fall in sales;;Electronic Arts on Monday presented a pessimistic outlook for the video game industry this year, predicting a fall in sales of disc-based games and issuing revenue forecasts that fell short of Wall Street expectations.While analysts had predicted growth of as much as 10 per cent in 2010, EA said it was assuming a 3 per cent fall in packaged goods game sales for the industry globally in its fiscal year starting in April.Its shares fell more than 8 per cent to $16.02 in extended trading in New York on the news.The stock of the second-biggest video game publisher has fallen 65 per cent over the past three years as it has failed to produce enough blockbuster games and struggled to rein in costs.The Silicon Valley company said it expected profits of 50 cents to 70 cents a share on revenues of $3.65bn to $3.9bn in its next fiscal year. Analysts on average were expecting profits of 74 cents on revenues of $4.07bn.“Relative to others that have provided guidance for the year, we’ve decided to be a little bit more conservative,” John Riccitiello, EA chief executive, told an analyst conference call.“We haven’t seen enough data to suggest that the purchase behaviours [of consumers] are there yet in spades.”The chief executive said there were reasons for optimism in a strong schedule of game releases and in the likelihood that new motion-based controllers from Microsoft and Sony would drive sales on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 platforms later this year.Revenues for the video game industry in the US fell 8 per cent in 2009, according to the NPD research firm.EA warned last month of sales of about $1.34bn and profits of 31 cents a share for its third quarter ending December 31, figures well below analyst expectations. On Monday, it reported a third quarter profit of $109m on sales of $1.35bn and earnings of 33 cents a share.The company has closed studios and is focusing on core titles in the coming year to cut costs.
172;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-01-28T01:36:51Z;Industry awaiting ‘Jesus Tablet’;;"Having seen Apple define the digital market for music, the wider media industry awaited its much-hyped iPad tablet computer with nervous anticipation.It will have to wait at least another 60 days, until the iPad hits the stores, before executives find out whether the device lives up to its “Jesus Tablet” billing as a saviour of media business models. Its success, executives said, rides on what Apple can deliver through its existing iTunes and Apps stores and its new iBookstore.Some media companies shared in Apple’s glory. Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon & Schuster signed up to the iBooks application. The New York Times demonstrated software able to run video within stories. Video game companies, including Electronic Arts, showed off sports, driving and shooting games that took advantage of the near 10-in display.“The iPad is a great new device that opens up tremendous growth opportunities for us and other content providers,” said Robert Iger, chief executive of Disney, on whose board Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, also sits.The iPad would be “awesome for movies and television shows”, Mr Jobs promised, while revealing little about Apple’s ambitious plans to sell low-priced television and video subscription packages.Content owners are wary of ceding their digital futures to a powerful device maker. One chief executive, declining to be named, said: “We would never undercharge for our content.”“Ultimately, the business model has to work,” said Quincy Smith, chief executive of CBS Interactive. “I’ve learnt recently to never underestimate Apple in products.”Others brushed off the hype. “Let’s be clear; this is an iPod Touch on steroids,” James McQuivey, a Forrester analyst, said. “That is not a new category.”John Makinson, chief executive of Penguin, which like the Financial Times is owned by Pearson, said: “I don’t think it’s a device which saves an industry, but I don’t think it’s an industry in need of salvation. It’s another step on the path towards the digital future of the publishing business.”Views on the iPad’s impact on more narrowly focused devices, such as Amazon’s Kindle and Sony’s eReader, differed. Ned May, an analyst at Outsell, said its colour screen, which offers a better platform for textbooks and illustrated children’s books, would “put some pressure” on Amazon and Sony’s monochrome gadgets.Steve Haber, president of Sony’s digital reading division, argued that the iPad would help the digital book market surpass print sales within five years.Mr Jobs said the iPad would “stand on the shoulders” of the Kindle but its business model is a challenge to Amazon. Apple will allow publishers to set pricing rather than pushing, as Amazon does, a fixed $9.99 price. Apple will also take just a 30 per cent cut of sales of books, magazines and other media content.Steve Hasker, president of media products at Nielsen, was sceptical but said, if successful, the iPad would offer “an interesting new revenue stream”.The biggest benefit for media companies, however, would be if the iPad helped retrain consumers weaned on free online content to start paying.“When people have a great experience, they consume more of the content they like, whether it be sports, books, games, TV or movies, and they are willing to pay to do so,” Mr Iger said.Any favours the iPad does for media owners will struggle to match the free publicity Apple has generated from the media’s obsessive analysis of the new device.Additional reporting by Matthew Garrahan in Los Angeles"
173;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-01-22T02:16:32Z;Tories’ new role for UK Film Council;;The UK Film Council could have its remit broadened to represent the computer games industry as well as cinema if a Conservative government were elected.Ed Vaizey, the shadow minister for culture and the creative industries, told a Westminster eForum on Thursday that he would favour the UK’s games sector joining forces with the film industry to gain more clout.“Video games need a voice at the top table,” he said. The UK games sector’s two trade associations, Tiga and Elspa, did not individually command the same attention in parliament as the Film Council, he said.One of the key roles of the UK Film Council is to distribute around £100m ($162m) a year in National Lottery money to support British film-makers.Richard Wilson, chief executive of Tiga, the industry association representing the computer developers, said games companies were likely to support a tie-up if it meant getting access to some of this funding.Senior executives in the games industry said they would be willing to consider working with the Film Council in order to raise the profile of gaming.“It is something that has to be looked at,” said Ian Livingston, life president of Eidos, the games company behind the Lara Croft Tomb Raider franchise.“We don’t have any representation on that level. It could be beneficial. I can see little downside, at least in the short term,” said Keith Ramsdale, head of Northern Europe for Electronic Arts, the US games publisher.Mr Vaizey also indicated that a Conservative government could be supportive of tax breaks, which the industry has been lobbying for over the last few years.“We do agree that the UK video games sector needs to develop a framework to be competitive with the rest of the world,” he said.Tiga has warned that without tax relief, employment in the UK games industry could decline five per cent a year for the next five years. Many development studios are moving work to countries like Canada, which offer generous tax incentives to companies in the sector.David Braben, founder of Frontier, one of the UK’s leading games development studios, said that the UK was in danger of falling to sixth position in the international games development league, compared with a third-place position only a few years ago.France put in place a tax relief scheme last year for games companies, but plans for a similar move in the UK were rejected in the pre-Budget report last month.The games industry employs around 28,000 people in the UK and contributes £1bn to GDP. Consumers spent £1.73bn on games in 2009, outstripping the £1.2bn spent at the cinema box office and on buying DVDs. However, the games sector has always struggled to gain recognition from politicians.
174;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-01-21T23:15:35Z;EA sticks with Tiger Woods, bails on PC;;"Electronic Arts is sticking with Tiger Woods  during his current problems, but is bailing out of PC packaged goods for its latest golf video game, launched in a free open beta today.
 EA is switching to an online version of Tiger Woods PGA Tour, withsales dwindling to almost nothing  for PC disk-based sports games, due to rampant piracy and many players preferring the console versions.
Tiger Woods  is the first attempt by EA to switch its PC sports titles to an online format and others are likely to follow if this proves a success.The game is graphically rich and has 3D visuals and wind effects. It is played within a browser window and the only download required is a one-time installation of theUnity graphics engine platform.
 The game connects to Facebook, allowing players to publish their achievements and invite their friends to become fans.They can also see others playing the same hole and chat with anyone on the course – seven well-known courses are currently available.To encourage players to keep coming back, there are tournaments and daily competitions including “The Cut Line”, where golfers try to beat a target score. They can also sponsor friends and earn in-game money if they make The Cut Line.The game should get an official launch in two months or so and EA plans to earn revenues with premium subscriptions and sales of virtual goods, such as new equipment and apparel from its “Pro Shop”.The Silicon Valley publisher also announced today that Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11  will be launched on the Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and iPhone in June.Tiger Woods will provide competition forWorld Golf Tour , a Flash-based free online game that has attracted a community of more than 1m golfers. Last year, it co-hosted the first virtual US Open with the USGA and it makes money through sponsored tournaments, in-game advertising and virtual micro-transactions."
175;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Wall St lower as earnings come up short;;A disappointing start to the earnings season sent US stocks lower on Tuesday.Shares in Alcoa, the country’s largest aluminium producer, dropped 11.1 per cent to $15.52 after it reported a lower fourth-quarter profit than analysts had forecast.While the group posted higher than expected revenues, it said the extra sales were due to unprofitable metal trades that it was forced to make to satisfy customer purchase agreements.Higher energy bills and a weak US dollar were to blame for the disappointing bottom line, it said.As the first company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to report quarterly results, Alcoa is thought to set the tone for the coming earnings season.The pessimism spread to the wider market and dragged the S&P 500 materials sector down 1.9 per cent.The Vix index, which measures risk aversion and is considered to be Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose for the first time in more than a week. The S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent to 1,136.22, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent to 10,627.26 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent lower at 2,282.31.“The consensus is that we are in some sort of recovery but how robust is it going to be?” said Matt King, chief investment strategist at Bell Investment Advisers. “Alcoa’s results are a sneak preview of where investors’ attentions are going to lie.”Chevron added to the cautious mood on Wall Street after announcing that its profit from the fourth quarter would be lower than the previous three months due to weaker refining margins.Shares in Chevron, the country’s second-largest energy producer, fell 0.6 per cent to $80.41.Electronic Arts, the world’s second-largest video game publisher, also weighed on the technology sector after slashing its forecast for this year following disappointing holiday sales.Like booksellers, the industry has suffered from a combination of lower consumer spending in the recession and greater competition from digital distributors.Last week, Gamestop, the country’s largest video games retailer, also cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast after disappointing results from the holiday season.Shares in both companies have dropped about 70 per cent over the past two years. Electronic was down 7.8 per cent to $16.85 yesterday while Gamestop added 2.2 per cent to $20.77.Elsewhere, KB Home, the housebuilder that targets first-time buyers, reported its first quarterly profit since 2007.However, the improvement to its bottom line was mainly due to a change in the tax law. Revenue still fell almost 30 per cent during the period, helping to send its shares down 4 per cent to $15.72.The rest of the industry initially followed suit and Pulte Homes, the country’s largest homebuilder, closed 0.6 per cent lower at $10.90 after heavy early losses.Banking stocks also suffered after the Obama administration said it was planning to impose a new levy on the sector to pay for the financial bail-out.Bank of America dropped 3.4 per cent to $16.36 while Citigroup was down 3 per cent at $3.52.However, the S&P 500 financial sector was only down 1.6 per cent due to positive news from the insurance industry.Hartford Financial Services, the insurer that has reported five straight quarterly losses, announced that it would beat analyst estimates for the last quarter due to lower underwriting losses. Its shares jumped 3.4 per cent to $27.12.Supervalu also helped to lift the market, gaining 5.8 per cent to $13.67. The country’s second-largest supermarket chain reported higher than expected quarterly profit and stood by its full-year forecast. The group, which operates about 2,500 stores, said cost-cutting would make up for falling sales.Meanwhile, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea, which operates the A&P supermarket chain, reported third-quarter sales sharply below Wall Street’s consensus estimate.The retailer, whose chief executive quit last October, has been posting losses for the past two years. Its shares tumbled 20.7 per cent to $10.22.
176;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2010-01-04T23:31:54Z;Top football turns focus to digital arena;;The Premier League is seeking to add to its list of sponsors by inviting companies to become an official technology partner in a move it says underlines the competition’s resilience to recession and its international reach.The new category will help the league increase revenue from sponsorship for the next three-year period, beginning next season, and is in keeping with its ability last year to attract increased value from UK broadcast rights despite the tough economic climate.But although the league hopes the new category will attract another international sponsor, it believes growing popularity abroad has not been fully exploited. It has begun a strategic review, to be completed by the end of 2010, aimed at tapping global opportunities more successfully.“There are parts of the world where the Premier League is more popular in percentage terms than in the UK. In many parts of the world we are the preferred league, and we are very interested to know why that is and to ensure that continues,” said Richard Masters, commercial director.Sponsorship makes up about 5 per cent of the Premier League’s £1bn annual turnover, with sponsors including Nike, Lucozade, Wrigley, EA Sports, Topps Merlin and Sporting iD. Last year, Barclays agreed to increase its payment to retain its title sponsorship, signing a three-year deal worth £82.5m.Premier League officials want to capitalise on its growing brand value by exploiting the public appetite in the UK and internationally for football statistics, and using technology that, for example, tracks the performance of individual players.Mr Masters said the league’s future would be built on exploiting the digital arena and its global opportunities. “The kind of sponsors we are going to be attracting are those that can exploit the digital space and those with an international platform,” he said.The new technology category will be the first since the Premier League appointed Budweiser as its official beer partner in 2002.The Premier League has long sought to capitalise on global interest but has until now left it to the 20 individual clubs to strike their own commercial deals.Barclays sponsors a biennial pre-season tour in Asia involving three Premier League teams. But a plan for each club to play an extra fixture abroad was dropped in the face of opposition from the Football Association and some clubs.“We have enjoyed a lot of value from biennial pre-season tournaments but we have to identify other vehicles,” said Mr Masters.The fan base abroad was growing, attracted by the clubs’ ability to fill stadiums and generate a passionate atmosphere, he added.Mr Masters said there were “many different entry points for brands and advertisers to come into the Premier League”, but that league officials would sit down with the clubs after summer to look at sponsorship models.Sponsors were buying into three things, he said: “An association with a great competition, a significant global media platform and the talkability of the Premier League, and the assets to promote their own brand.”The value of the current three-year sponsorship and licensing deals were a 25 per cent improvement on the previous term, said Mr Masters. “We would look to do better than that next [time], at any rate in revenue terms.”
177;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-12-31T18:55:24Z;AT&T breaks ties with Tiger Woods;;AT&T has dropped its sponsorship of Tiger Woods following weeks of allegations of marital infidelity by the golf star.The US telecommunications group is the latest corporate sponsor to sever ties with the golfer, and joins Accenture, the global consultancy.Other companies have sought to distance themselves from the world’s wealthiest athlete.“We are ending our sponsorship agreement with Tiger Woods and wish him well in the future,” AT&T said on Thursday.AT&T’s logo adorns Mr Woods’s golf bag, but he does not appear in its advertisements. AT&T will continue to sponsor a PGA golf tournament this year.Procter & Gamble is still a sponsor, but has scaled back Gillette advertisements featuring Mr Woods. Tag Heuer, the Swiss watchmaker, is reviewing its endorsement deal with the golfer.Nike, the world’s largest sports shoe and clothing business, has remained supportive in recent weeks.Mr Woods’s spate of bad publicity began in late November after a minor car accident outside his home, which exposed a slate of allegations. Shortly afterwards, he said he would take “indefinite” leave from professional golf.Since the negative publicity began, sponsors have pulled advertisements featuring Mr Woods.His departure from golf has cost up to $12bn in stock market value for his nine largest sponsors, according to two economics professors at the University of California. That estimate does not include Mr Woods’s own earnings.Their study tracked eight publicly listed sponsors, which also include Electronic Arts, for 13 trading days from November 27, the date of the car crash, to December 17, a week after Mr Woods announced that he was leaving the sport.Mark Parker, Nike chief executive, said last month the company would “continue to support Tiger and his family as we look forward to his return”, in spite of the fact that he had “chosen to step away from the game” indefinitely.Nike’s golf business, with about $650m in annual sales, has a multimillion-dollar endorsement relationship with Mr Woods, which has included developing a golf shoe, clubs and other equipment.Omar Saad, analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a research note last month Mr Woods’s problems could lead Nike and other groups to reassess the effectiveness of celebrity relationships.
178;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-12-22T20:02:58Z;Battle of quality instead of quantity;Historic technology shift will have more than one winner;Name an internet-connected device, and as the Apple commercial would say, there’s an App store for it.Nokia, Research in Motion’s BlackBerry, Palm, Microsoft, and the surging number of gadgets running Google’s Android operating system all provide access to online retail centres where people can browse programs to buy and install on their phones.Apple’s success with the iPhone and the 100,000 applications that now run on it has helped it reached a market value equal to Google’s. Some of its competitors’ attempts to mimic Apple’s achievement can appear unimpressive by contrast.Yet Android, in spite of appearing only a little more than a year ago, now offers 20,000 apps, double the number available just five months ago. The sheer number of apps now on offer means the contest between phone platforms is now focused on quality, not quantity.More fundamentally, the apps boom on Android shows that the historic technology shift now under way will have more than one winner. Even those who have tied their fortunes to the iPhone, such as program developers, say that the surging “app economy” is much bigger than one family of products offered by one company.Gus Tai of Trinity Ventures, a venture capital firm which has significant investments in companies making iPhone apps, says: “Android is definitely going to be a force to be reckoned with”.Now other hand-held devices can connect to the internet in a usable way, the iPhone is losing some of its competitive advantage. In addition, developers point out that it is not difficult to tweak a program made for the iPhone to run well on another gadget.David Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor says: “Most previous application environments had fairly significant switching costs”.“From Apple to Unix or Windows, it was very costly for a firm to make the move. But the cost for moving an app from Apple to Android is $5,000 or less for a typical company. It’s actually very inexpensive.”Prof Yoffie says that he expects several smartphone platforms to survive, with the top apps available on each.While Apple has the lead in sheer number of applications and in unit sales of the most high-functioning phones, it will be a serious challenge to retain it in the long term.Gartner technology consultancy predicted in October that Android phones, now supported by the four US wireless carriers with the greatest number of customers, would overtake Apple in unit sales by 2012 and rank second in smartphone share only to Nokia.The significant factors in Android’s favour are the system’s support from web behemoth Google and the fact that it is open-source, so that anyone can modify it for distribution.That said, the app market on Android has had some hiccups. For now, sales can be made only through Google Checkout, a virtual payment platform that has not been as widely adopted as rivals such as PayPal and is not available in all countries. Developers complain that consumers have a hard time finding out about their wares.Programmers have another worry, which is that Android runs on a range of hardware. They can tailor a game to work best on one sort of Android phone, but it will function differently when it is used on another sort of phone or even on an Android laptop.However, the number of apps installed per Android handset owner is rising, and there are other signs that the platform is strengthening. Google’s David Conway, senior product manager for Android, says: “Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, if you’re talking about paid apps, we’ve seen a tripling of transaction volume and revenues”.Most of the best-selling apps on the iPhone and Android phones are games, but business software is also being distributed, and corporate technology departments are agreeing to support more of the devices.The good news for Android and other iPhone competitors is that so much computing activity is moving towards the “cloud”, where data are stored remotely and can be accessed from phones or computers anywhere. By design, programs that handle such data already work well with multiple devices. That means the iPhone will not be able to control exclusively processing requests to access the programs and data.Those who have the most money at stake, such as investors and entrepreneurs, are convinced that no single company, nor even one sort of hardware, will dominate the market. They say the big winners in software will be those that prove the most flexible, allowing different experiences from varying devices.Mr Tai, referring to a series of electronic games based on American football that demands a great deal of processing power, says: “It’s not whether Madden will go on your phone.“It’s what parts of it could be hived off.”Lars Buttler, a former head of the online division at Electronic Artsvideogaming company, makes games that reside on the cloud at his company Trion World Network.He says that players of Trion games would, for example, give simple orders to characters from their BlackBerry while the action takes place on servers elsewhere.He says: “We refuse to see the console or the PC or the iPod as a platform. It’s an access device.“The platform is broadband. And that’s everywhere.”Apple has what many see as the best gadget and for now the broadest array of things to do with those gadgets. But the former is a matter of degree and the latter is more about bragging rights than superior utility. In a world where access to the web is what matters most, Apple cannot expect to rule alone.
179;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-12-21T19:41:38Z;Games guru puts his finger on chart success;;Inside the San Francisco offices of iPhone application maker Ngmoco, across from the Giants’ baseball stadium, the forces of modern games are colliding.Neil Young, chief executive, left Electronic Arts, one of the two leading electronic gaming companies, to start Ngmoco last year to take advantage of big developments in the industry.First, games that did not require a lot of time or processing power, such as the role-playing games Mobsters and Mafia Wars, had started to spread on MySpace and Facebook.Social games have a financial advantage over console games, where Electronic Arts and Activision are strongest, because they require much less up-front investment and because they can be improved daily in response to how they are played. Distribution costs can be as little as zero, if friends convince other friends to play.Second, in 2008 Apple announced that it would open its Apple Store to outsiders, putting nearly any developer with a great product a few finger-taps away from millions of iPhone users.“It felt like one of those inflection moments. This felt like one of the biggest,” Mr Young said, and in March he started assembling a cadre of like-minded industry veterans and venture funding.In the year-and-a-half since, the company – which has fewer than 40 employees – has landed six games in Apple’s Top Ten charts, notching up more than 10m downloads.One of the guiding principles that Ngmoco espouses is to combine games with a heavy social component, so that people interact while playing and thus recruit additional players. Another is that games should be free to play, but that spending money inside them should make them more enjoyable. Ngmoco’s Eliminate did that so well that it became the first game to make the separate Top Ten charts for free games and also for top-grossing games.In June, Ngmoco became the latest gamemaker to deploy a social network for its games and those of partners, so that the players who know each other from one imagined world can find each other in another, while the company cross-promotes its wares.But all of that is so far only on the iPhone, and that is not where Ngmoco is going to stay. “The web is the central platform,” said Clive Downie, marketing vice-president. “The question is how we make games on other devices that utilise the web as well.”
180;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-12-21T19:41:38Z;App army promises new tech revolution;;A decade ago, San Francisco’s trendy South of Market district was the birthplace of hundreds of web design firms that have since gone under or been swallowed by rivals.Now it is the turn of the “app army”, the scores of companies devoted to churning out the small applications that run on Apple’s iPhone and rival devices, as well as on regular computers for users of Facebook and similar websites.App sales are booming at a time when corporations are cutting tech spending and consumers are pinching pennies.Indeed, veteran industry executives, investors and analysts are calling the shift to internet-capable devices and the apps that run on them a once-a-decade leap in technology, on a par with the great personal computing boom of the 1980s and the debut of the world wide web in the 1990s.“The ramp [growth rate] of the iPhone and iPod Touch in the first eight or nine quarters is more than five times the ramp for the internet,” says Kathryn Huberty, Morgan Stanley tech analyst. These devices, and faster wireless networks, are both now reaching about a fifth of the global population, she estimates, which will drive much more rapid development: “Globally,” she says, “2010 is the tipping point.”No company is more central to the shift towards the mobile internet than Apple, which enjoys a wide lead in distributing applications. More than 100,000 apps are available on its App Store and there have been more than 2bn app downloads in less than a year and a half.To keep that gusher flowing, Apple has sought to inspire more outsider developers with the rare rags-to-riches stories such as that of Steve Demeter, a bank programmer who earned $250,000 in two months of 2008 after launching a simple game called Trism.But just as many from the frontlines of the dot-com revolution were left on the battlefield, not all of those writing for the tiny screen will make it big.“It’s just getting ridiculously overwhelmed right now because of all these stories about people getting rich. It’s few and far between,” says solo developer Barry Egerter of Ontario, who hit the number-one spot on the best-selling paid app chart last Thursday.Even though Mr Egerter made it to the top, it took a year’s work. He has quit his day job, and earned perhaps $200,000 before taxes with Live Cams, a 99-cent app that allows users to look through the lenses of internet-controlled security cameras. Mr Egerter expects his ride at the top to be like that of most who make it there: exciting and brief. “If things don’t work out, I may just find another desk job,” he says.Rather than the small individual developers, it is the biggest companies that are faring the best. Electronic Arts, which has been one of the largest-grossing games sellers for a decade, had four of 2009’s top-five selling App Store games.EA, which has expanded both organically and through acquisition, in 2005 made its largest bet until then by buying early phone gaming company Jamdat for $680m. And last month it bought London-based Playfish, one of the three revenue-leading specialists in social games – and one developing a bigger iPhone presence – for about $300m.Zynga, the biggest social gaming company by revenue with FarmVille and Mafia Wars, has stripped-down versions of some games on the iPhone.The advantages the bigger companies have over the smaller developers – scale, expertise and marketing know-how – mean there may not be any “app millionaires” in the years ahead, says Matt Murphy of venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, who runs a fund devoted to backing iPhone developers.But small groups that have multiple successes will be pursued by bigger companies. “There will be teams of people who get a hit franchise acquired for north of $1m,” Mr Murphy says.The business models are changing so rapidly, though, that it is hard to make firm predictions.Advertising money adds to the income from direct app sales, and ads inside games helped the three biggest mobile advertising networks globally, AdMob, Quattro Wireless and Millennial Media, to double revenues in the past year.Through trial and error, apps developers have discovered that having a free version of a program would help them market a fuller, paid version – the “freemium” model.And just months after it started allowing supplemental purchases within paid applications, Apple agreed in October to allow purchases within free apps, creating a new path to profit.Ideally, some of the most sophisticated apps makers would like to become services themselves, so that they have the same sort of ongoing relationship with customers that Apple does.But if they do that, it is unclear how vital Apple will be to the equation.Tomorrow: apps beyond Apple
181;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-12-16T18:08:33Z;DST leads $180m Zynga investment;;The market in games on social networks such as Facebook received a boost after Digital Sky Technologies, a private Russian internet group, led a $180m investment in Zynga.Zynga, based in San Francisco, is best known for developing the Farmville game, which with more than 69m players on Facebook has more users than the whole of Twitter.The deal follows Electronic Arts’ $400m acquisition of Playfish, Zynga’s largest rival, last month.DST is already an investor in Facebook, which, with more than 350m members, is the world’s largest social network. After a $200m investment in May that valued Facebook at $10bn, DST purchased a further $100m in common stock from existing shareholders in July.Yuri Milner, chief executive of DST, said: “Our earlier investment in Facebook and now in Zynga underscores our premise that social networking and social entertainment will define the next generation of the web.”Zynga claims to be the largest developer of applications on Facebook, with 230m active monthly users. Its games, such as Mafia Wars, Live Poker and Vampires: Bloodlust, are also available on MySpace, Bebo and Apple’s iPhone.The sale of virtual goods, such as crops and tractors for Farmville, makes up 90 per cent of Zynga’s revenues. The US market for virtual goods has been estimated to be worth $1bn this year.However, Zynga and Facebook face a class-action lawsuit over advertisements embedded within Zynga’s games. The suit claims payments were taken from users’ credit cards without their knowledge. Zynga has declined to comment on the suit, but has removed the offending ads. Facebook has said it is not liable because the ads were hosted by an outside ad network.DST makes up the majority of Zynga’s latest $180m funding round alongside new investors Andreessen Horowitz, the venture firm run by the founder of Netscape, and Tiger Global, a New York hedge fund, and Institutional Ventures Partners, an existing shareholder.“We are excited about our relationship with DST as they are a global player dedicated to creating services that are meaningful to consumers in the long term,” said Mark Pincus, founder and chief executive of Zynga.
182;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Woods an asset even with ‘transgressions’;;Accenture’s latest advertising campaign has a picture of Tiger Woods standing on the edge of a stream, club in hand, looking at his ball perched precariously on a rock. “It’s what you do next that counts,” reads the global management consultancy’s strapline.Sponsors of the world’s number one golfer have been asking that question every day since last Friday morning when he drove his Cadillac sports utility vehicle into a tree and a fire hydrant outside his Florida home.The media firestorm that followed the incident, resulting in Mr Woods’ statement on Wednesday apologising to his family for what he called “transgressions” in his private life, is hardly a narrative sponsors had in mind in return for investing about $100m a year in the golf superstar.“The sponsors will definitely be telling him and his people, ‘you have to stop this now, you have to get up front, you have to become pro-active in how you deal with this,’” says Lesa Ukman, founder and chairman of IEG the Chicago-based sponsorship consultancy, who estimates Woods’ total earnings at about $750m.But if there is short-term anxiety among Woods’ commercial backers, publicly at least they were not letting on. One by one, Nike, EA Sports, Gillette, NetJets and Gatorade have put their arm round Mr Woods and declared that their relationship continues.Such wholehearted support comes as little surprise to the sponsorship industry. One reason is that, while Mr Woods and his advisers have built his image around many values, such as his diversity, his connection with young people, his appeal to C-level executives and his well-spoken demeanour, Christian morality is not one of them.“It’s not like it’s a crisis of hypocrisy,” says Ms Ukman. Sponsors may have so-called “morality” clauses tied up in their contracts, allowing them to withdraw if the client’s moral behaviour materially damages their brand reputation, but Ms Ukman does not envisage any of Woods’ sponsors exercising them.David Letterman, the talk show host, has kept his reputation largely intact following his confession in October to affairs with his staff. So too Michael Phelps, eight-times gold medallist at the Beijing Olympics, who admitted to “bad judgment” after being photographed smoking dope .Sponsors will also be mindful of research showing some companies’ brand values suffering after walking away from sportsmen and teams whose performace has declined, while the brands of others being enhanced for sticking with clients in the face of adversity.For Mr Woods’ myriad sponsors, there is the added calculation that he remains at the top of his game, and as long as that continues their returns on investment should continue to be healthy. The industry benchmark for licensing sponsors is about $4 returned for every $1 of investment. For other sponsors, it is about $2.50 to $1.The US PGA Tour, where Woods plies his trade, readily acknowledges the importance of Woods to the game. Ty Votaw, an executive vice-president of the tour, says his commercial value is immense, particularly in his ability to bring the casual sports fan to golf.“There is no question that at events that Tiger plays, interest leves in terms of audience, TV ratings and media coverage spike.“Golf has certainly benefited by the fact that the most recognised athlete in the world plays this sport. You would expect that commercial interest will have increased because of that.”Mr Woods is missing from the greens, having pulled out of this week’s Chevron World Challenge in California, a tournament he hosts. Sponsors will hope that by the time he returns, he will have safely extracted himself from this fiendishly tricky position.
183;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-12-02T20:47:06Z;Woods sponsors take the long view;;Many of Tiger Woods’s sponsors made clear they intended to stick with the world number one golfer in the wake of his public apology to his family on Wednesday for “transgressions” in his private life.Mr Woods is the world’s highest earning sportsman and his sponsorship deals are estimated to be worth $100m a year. His clean-cut reputation has been tarnished since he crashed his Cadillac into a fire hydrant and a tree outside his Florida home in the early hours of last Friday.Speculation about his private life led Mr Woods to issue a statement on his website on Wednesday. He had “not been true to my values and the behaviour my family deserves”, he said.“I am not without faults and I am far short of perfect. I am dealing with my behaviour and personal failings behind closed doors with my family.”Mr Woods, winner of 14 majors and $93m in prize money, has 13 official sponsors. Sponsorship experts say his brand value is “irreplaceable” and many of those sponsors appeared willing to forgive his imperfections.Gillette, the Procter & Gamble personal care business, said it did not comment on the private lives of its “ambassadors”, but added: “Like each of us, they are human. And like each of us, they make mistakes.“By acknowledging and learning from their mistakes, we hope they will become even better, both in the game and beyond.”Nike, the sporting goods manufacturer, said its relationship with the golfer “remains unchanged”, the same phrase used by EA Sports, the video games maker. Gatorade, the manufacturer of sports drinks, offered its support to Mr Woods and his family, saying: “Our partnership continues.”NetJets, the business aviation company, repeated a statement made this week by David Sokol, its chief executive, that it was “proud” to be involved with the golfer.AT&T declined to comment.Karen Earl, chairman of the European Sponsorship Association, which represents commercial sponsors, said Mr Woods’s crown had “slightly slipped” but he was too valuable a property for sponsors to desert.Nigel Currie of the agency BrandRapport said the stature of Mr Woods, and the fact that he was likely to remain at the pinnacle of golf for some years, would help him weather the storm of media attention.“He is irreplaceable,” Mr Currie said. “This is the sort of thing that time will heal, but it is going to cause a change of direction.”According to Philip Stinson, media and entertainment lawyer at Clintons, US sponsors favour “morality” clauses in contracts, which enable them to terminate agreements if a sportsman’s behaviour materially damages the sponsor’s reputation.“The grey area is in defining behaviour which isn’t imprisonable but is arguably morally suspect and whether it can reasonably be said that the behaviour has had any material negative impact on the good name and image of the sponsor,” Mr Stinson said.
184;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-11-11T00:50:43Z;Adobe joins tech jobs cull;;A fresh wave of job cuts has started to ripple through the technology industry, despite mounting evidence that tech companies have weathered the worst of the recession and are seeing the first signs of an upturn.The cuts reflect a move to streamline further after the fall-off in orders this year, as well as the after-effects of acquisitions and the failure of some big companies to keep pace with changes in their markets.Adobe, the software maker, on Tuesday became the latest to cut back as it announced plans to shed 680 jobs, or 9 per cent of its workforce.It blamed the job losses on a move to “appropriately align” its costs with its 2010 business plan.In a sign of confidence, the group, which makes the Acrobat document reader and Photoshop software, recently reaffirmed its financial guidance for next year and said it expected the launch of Microsoft and Apple operating systems to trigger higher demand for its desktop software.Like other big tech companies, Adobe had acted quickly to shed jobs when the recession took hold, sacking 600 workers at the end of last year. But with revenues down 18 per cent in the first nine months, the company signalled that it needed to bring its costs down further.Microsoft took similar action last week as it cut a further 800 jobs. That came on top of the 5,000 job losses it announced in January, the first time in its 34-year history that it had been forced into company-wide cost-cutting.Other tech companies have recently announced plans to cut back even more severely as they adjust for bigger declines in their businesses. Electronic Arts, the video-game maker which has struggled with a lack of new hit products, said this week that it would axe 1,500 jobs, or 17 per cent of its workforce. The cuts come on top of an 11 per cent reduction last year.Meanwhile Sun Microsystems said last month that it would cut 3,000 jobs, marking its 10th restructuring plan as it tries to deal with a shift in its markets that has seen customers move to lower-cost, standardised servers.The company also put the timing of the latest cuts down to a delay in the completion of its acquisition by Oracle, which this week became the subject of an official objection from European regulators.The rise in merger and acquisition activity in the sector has also taken its toll on workers. Abobe recently sacked 9 per cent of the 1,200 employees at Omniture, a fast-growing e-commerce software company it acquired last month.
185;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-11-10T22:02:04Z;Wall Street’s rally loses steam;;Wall Street’s rally stalled on Tuesday after a series of disappointing results from the US’s corporate heavyweights gave investors reason for caution.After opening lower, the market wavered between gains and losses and the S&P 500 finally closed flat at 1,093.01.The Nasdaq lost 0.1 per cent to 2,151.08 but the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 10,246.97, hitting fresh highs for the year.Reassuring comments from the Group of 20 leading nations on economic stimulus programmes had prompted a rally across global markets on Monday, lifting the Dow close to its highest level since October last year. Stocks had also closed higher every day last week in spite of data showing a rise in unemployment.However, disappointing corporate results on Tuesday gave investors a reason to pause.Shares in Fluor, the largest listed engineering company in the US, fell 7.6 per cent to $44.38 after it reduced its full-year earnings forecast. Its third-quarter profits also missed estimates because of lower spending on energy projects.United Rentals, the world’s largest equipment rental company, announced plans to sell $150m of senior unsecured convertible notes due in 2015, prompting a downgrade from Moody’s. The shares fell 9.9 per cent to $8.89.Electronic Arts, the video game publisher, reported a wider quarterly loss than expected and said it would cut about 1,500 jobs. The company cut 11 per cent of its workforce last year.Earlier this week, the company also announced that it had acquired Playfish for $275m in an effort to move into the burgeoning social gaming sector. The shares were down 6.4 per cent at $18.29.GT Solar International, which supplies solar-cell manufacturers, lost 14.1 per cent to $4.76 after its profit fell by two-thirds. Like other companies invested in solar energy, GT Solar has been hit by falling demand as clients have found themselves unable to get financing for new projects.MBIA, the world’s largest bond insurer, also reported a wider loss than had been expected because of writedowns on mortgage bonds. After losing its high credit rating last year, the group has also struggled to attract new business. The shares fell 26.7 per cent to $3.52.Anthracite Capital, the commercial real estate investment company run by BlackRock, warned that it might not be able to continue as a going concern after reporting a wider third-quarter loss than had been expected.The group said that it had suffered from rising delinquencies and the drop in the value of commercial property. Its shares lost 46.8 per cent to 41 cents.Randy Cass, founder of First Coverage, the research group that tracks market sentiment, said that Wall Street’s confidence was unlikely to be shaken for long.“The financial community has so much vested in ending this year positively that’s it’s going to take more than crossing the imaginary threshold of 10 per cent unemployment or an ambiguous data point somewhere.“These are all things that aren’t going to derail this rally because they are all things that can be spun by the sell side to their buy-side clients to ensure that everybody is on board to make sure this market ends this year near its highs.”Priceline.com also lifted sentiment from the opening bell on Tuesday. The online travel agency forecast fourth-quarter profits above estimates, helping its shares gain 17.6 per cent to $204.22.Shares in Beazer Homes advanced 8.7 per cent to $5.10 after the homebuilder reported its first quarterly profit in more than a year. The group, which caters primarily to first-time homebuyers, has been plagued by liquidity problems and government probes into its mortgage operations.However, it said that a federal tax credit and low mortgage rates had helped boost demand.Moody’s gave a boost to American International Group shares after the credit rating agency said that the insurer would likely be able to repay the government’s loan and much of its preferred equity stake, lifting the shares 3.9 per cent to $37.59.
186;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-11-09T17:23:30Z;EA to pay $275m cash for Playfish;;Electronic Arts has entered the fast-growing market for games on social networks with its $400m purchase of Playfish.Playfish, known for games on Facebook such as Pet Society and Restaurant City, will join EA’s interactive division.EA’s deal is comprised of around $275m in cash and $25m in shares, with a further $100m dependent on performance until the end of 2011.Over 60m people play one of Playfish’s 10 games each month, with 150m installed on online platforms including Apple’s iPhone, MySpace and Bebo.The deal will see Playfish’s games move to full-fledged consoles, such as the Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii, as well as the Playfish team adapting existing EA titles for playing on social networks.“Social networking gaming is huge and it is growing exponentially,” Barry Cottle, general manager of EA Interactive, told the FT. “With Playfish we are getting an incredible team that makes great games.”Mr Cottle did not comment specifically on the Playfish valuation but said online deals took into consideration the addressable audience, number of existing gamers and average revenues per user.Kristian Segerstrale, chief executive and co-founder of Playfish, told the FT the deal would allow Playfish to “build that billion-dollar business far quicker” than it would be able to as a standalone company.“We’ve been totally laser-focused on changing how the world plays games,” he said. “This combination is a huge leap forward in that mission.”The rapid rise of social gaming, which has been dominated by independent companies such as Playfish and Zynga, has introduced a new business model to the sector.While most of EA’s revenues depend on selling packaged games at retail stores, social games attract new customers who see their friends playing them on Facebook and then pay for extra features, new levels or power-ups. Playfish also makes money from advertising.Accel Partners and Index Ventures, which had invested $21m in Playfish last year, are selling their stake in the deal.Kevin Comolli of Accel Partners said: “As the original institutional seed investor in Playfish it has been a pleasure to work with the founders and management team and to see them achieve such extraordinary growth. We are sure they will continue to thrive under the ownership of Electronic Arts.”Analysts welcomed the deal but said it was unlikely to stem more fundamental problems at EA.“Social games are the fastest growing area of gaming, so it’s a slight positive for EA,” said Edward Woo, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities who follows video games.In August, EA reported that quarterly losses widened and revenues fell through the three months ending in July. The Redwood City-based company lost $234m during that period compared with $95m during the same time last year. EA reports quarterly earnings later on Monday.“It’s still a small, small drop in the bucket for EA,” said Mr Woo.Mr Woo also said that EA paid steeply for Playfish. With Playfish revenues reported to be about $75m, the deal values the young company at more than four times revenues. “On the surface it seems like a very high price,” he said.There is also no certainty that social games will continue their hot streak. “Social gaming is still growing really rapidly, but how big can it go?” said Mr Woo. “We saw all the same hype that came with mobile gaming, but that kind of stalled out. Now everyone is piling into social gaming. It may stall too.”Mr Woo said this was the beginning of a round of exists for other social gaming companies. He said he expects Zynga, the largest social gaming company, to go public sometime soon.
187;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-10-09T22:47:33Z;EA takes the money and runs with iPhone 3.0;;A battle of the bands is coming to the iPhone. No sign of Guitar Hero yet, but Electronic Arts showed off Rock Band for the iPhone and iPod touch this week at the CTIA show in San Diego.That will put it in competition with the hugely successful Tap Tap Revenge from Tapulous, a similar rhythm game that has brought out special editions for musicians such as Coldplay, Lady Gaga and Nine Inch Nails.EA demonstrated the multiplayer capabilities of Rock Band aboard their tour bus at CTIA – they say it is the first game to offer a full band multiplayer experience on the platform. I connected with three other players sat around me via Bluetooth and we played Steve Miller’s Take The Money and Run on guitars and drums – vocals are also being promised for the final version.Touch is the key to playing, as you tap the notes as they scroll by.Facebook Connect also allows players to invite friends to jam with one another online.Twenty songs are included in the game and EA is using improvements in the 3.0 operating system for the iPhone to offer in-game purchases of more songs.EA also showed me their forthcoming Wear It sets and Live It sets for The Sims on the iPhone. The 3.0 OS means the publisher can now introduce its “Expansion Pack” business model, which has been so successful on the PC, to the iPhone. Players can expand their Sims world, with Castle or Campus Life environments for example, or Vampires and Werewolves clothing and accessories.These are the first games where EA Mobile has taken advantage of the extended e-commerce opportunities now being offered by Apple.Rock Band is expected to appear on the App Store in the next few weeks, once it has gone through Apple’s approval process, with The Sims extras also due around the same time.
188;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Wall Street slips in choppy trading;;"US stocks relinquished early gains on Thursday after an unexpected fall in home sales left investors concerned about the pace of economic recovery.The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales in August had dropped to an annualised rate of 5.1m from a rate of 5.24m in July. Economists had been expecting sales to rise to 5.35m.Stocks had opened higher on encouraging jobs data. The number of Americans filing fresh claims for unemployment benefits last week dropped to 530,000 from a revised 551,000 in the previous week.Investors also continued to mull Wednesday’s policy statement from the Federal Reserve, which had resulted in a sudden sell-off in the hour before the closing bell.The S&P 500 closed almost 1 per cent lower on Thursday at 1,050.78. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 9,707.44 and the Nasdaq fell 1.1 per cent to 2,107.61. Choppy trading set up the CBOE’s Vix index, known as the volatility index or Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, for its highest close in just over two weeks.However, Randy Cass, founder of First Coverage, which tracks market sentiment, said Thursday’s declines were unlikely to spark a big pull-back.“The sell-side has to see something that shows this rally is conclusively over, that the economy is going to double-dip, that something horrible is on the horizon. Only at that point in time will they actually tell the buy-side client base to take their money out of this market, to sell their long positions or to get short. Today is not that point.”Commodity stocks led the market’s declines on Thursday as oil prices dropped sharply. Alcoa fell 4.5 per cent to $13.51 and United States Steel lost 3.8 per cent to $48. After closing 2 per cent lower on Wednesday, the S&P 500 materials index fell a further 2 per cent.The financial sector, which helped lead the late sell-off on Wednesday,
also gave up early gains and dragged the market lower. Bank of America lost 3 per cent to $16.98 and JPMorgan slipped 1.5 per cent to $44.37.Citigroup fell 2 per cent to $4.43 after initial gains, sparked by speculation that the bank planned to shrink its retail banking network.In what is expected to be the most active week for equity listings since December 2007, Artio Global Investors, Julius Baer’s asset management arm, made its market debut. After pricing shares at the top end of estimates at $26, raising $650m to buy out the Swiss bank’s stake in the company, the stock gained 4.8 per cent to $27.25. Richard Pell, Artio’s chief executive, said: “We get the sense that investors and
the IPO market are
coming back”.Technology stocks had led the market’s early gains. Red Hat jumped 12.3 per cent to $27.95 after the software company reported better-than-expected quarterly results and upgrades from several brokerages.The group, which is the world’s biggest provider of Linux, the free operating system, has benefited from the rising popularity of open-source software as companies look to cut costs in the recession.Shares of 3Com gained 5.9 per cent to $5.06 after the company’s first-quarter results beat expectations.But Electronic Arts, which makes video games, fell 2.7 per cent to $19.29 after a Microsoft executive quashed rumours it was planning to buy the company.Chelsea Therapeutics lost the most ground on the Nasdaq, dropping 61 per cent to $2.73 after the biotechnology group reported disappointing trial results.American Greetings helped boost sentiment after reporting a steep increase in second-quarter profit. Revenue still fell at the company, which owns brands such as Carlton Cards, but cost-cutting improved the bottom line. The shares soared 29 per cent to $19.37.In the retail sector, Bed Bath & Beyond, the variety chain, reported better-than-expected profits for the second quarter. However, the shares fell 3.2 per cent to $37.75 after the company refrained from boosting its profit outlook.Rite Aid reported a smaller quarterly loss than expected, thanks to cost- cuts, but forecast a deeper loss for the year. Shares in the pharmacy chain fell 12.3 per cent to $1.71."
189;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-09-23T19:58:43Z;Microsoft claims big support for Natal;;Microsoft threw down the gauntlet to game rival Sony in the race to develop a challenger to Nintendo’s Wii, saying that most top game publishers were developing products for the US group’s Xbox 360 motion controller.Publishers that accounted for 70 per cent of third-party software sales were making games for the Natal controller, said Don Mattrick, head of Microsoft’s videogame division.Natal uses an infrared camera to measure a gamer’s motion in three dimensions and turn it into input for a game. In one demonstration, a user can drive a car by turning an imaginary steering wheel and pressing an imaginary pedal, without the need for a physical controller.Natal and Sony’s equivalent, both due out next year, are at the heart of the battle to differentiate between the consoles and compete with Nintendo’s Wii.Publisher support is vital because sales of the motion controllers will depend on the games that use them.Sony’s controller uses a conventional camera to track a device in the player’s hands. The motion sensor in Nintendo’s Wii that made that console a success after its launch in 2006 uses accelerometers built into a handheld controller.Nintendo’s Wii has sold 50m units compared with 30m Xbox 360s and 24m PS3s. Nintendo has attracted new people into gaming with its intuitive, motion-sensing controls and focus on casual games.Both Microsoft and Sony have cut their console prices,hoping their motion controllers will help them draw in new customers.Mr Mattrick said: “Traditionally inside the industry, [the launch of innovative hardware is] when new hits get created, when new categories get defined, when things that have driven billions of dollars of sales get created.“We think that’s a substantial opportunity for our third-party publishers.”All five of Japan’s top publishers – Capcom, Konami, Namco Bandai, Sega and Square Enix – are developing games for Natal.In the US, Activision Blizzard, Bethesda Softworks, Disney Interactive, Electronic Arts and MTV Games were developing for Natal, as was Ubisoft of France, Mr Mattrick said.At the Tokyo Games Show, which opens on Thursday, Microsoft will host a discussion on the gaming possibilities of Natal with the Japanese developers behind such hit games as Capcom’s Dead Rising, Sega’s Super Monkey Ball, and Konami’s Metal Gear Solid series of espionage thrillers.It is not yet clear whether publishers are developing games that work with only Natal or that support Natal and Sony’s motion controller as options alongside traditional control.In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Yoichi Wada, the president of Square Enix video game publisher, said he expected the new motion controllers to have a limited impact on console sales, because they improved gaming but did not add an entirely new function.
190;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-09-07T21:29:07Z;Viacom revives Beatlemania;;Beatlemania finally comes to video games on Wednesday with the release of The Beatles: Rock Band title.Philippe Dauman, chief executive of Viacom, parent of MTV Games and Rock Band developer Harmonix, told analysts recently. “It’s a work of art. This will change the way that people look at music video games.”With sales sagging this year, Viacom and the industry need a Sergeant Pepper moment. Viacom said it suffered a 41 per cent decline in ancillary revenues in its last quarter, driven by lower sales of Rock Band.Video game hardware and software sales were down for a fifth month in a row in July in the US, with revenues falling 29 per cent compared with a year earlier.But this month is expected to be the start of a major revival, fired by the release of the Beatles game and price cuts coming into effect for Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and Sony’s PlayStation 3 consoles.The Beatles: Rock Band consists of software to play along rhythmically to 45 Beatles tracks from early hits such as “I Want To Hold Your Hand” through to “Here Comes the Sun” and “Get Back”.A bundle selling for $250 in the US includes the software, a controller shaped like Paul McCartney’s bass guitar, a drum kit and microphone with stand.Controllers resembling the guitars of John Lennon and George Harrison can be bought separately for $100 each.Conscious of the high cost, the publisher Electronic Arts is giving consumers some cheaper options – a value bundle with other instruments sells for $160 and the software alone can be bought for $60 and used with existing microphones and controllers from other games.Michael Pachter, video game analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities, says there is pent-up demand from traditional non-gamers, who have tired of playing Nintendo’s motion-sensing Wii with its sports and fitness games and are waiting for the next big thing.“I think a ton of people are going to buy The Beatles: Rock Band,” he says.“Anybody over 40 pretty much knows all the words to every Beatles song here and this game is going to get more advertising support in mainstream channels than any game ever before.”Activision Blizzard released Guitar Hero 5 last week in competition. The bigger franchise was the first to ignite the music genre with its guitar controller.It will follow up next month with DJ Hero, which uses a turntable controller to appeal to hip-hop and club music fans.“I don’t see it being as successful as Guitar Hero,” says Libe Goad, editor-in-chief of GameDaily.com.“Simply because people can’t relate as easily to a turntable as they can to picking up a guitar.”
191;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-09-02T17:32:41Z;Video games industry still holds the controls;;While digital media and the internet have proved to be more threats than opportunities for the music, film and broadcast industries, for the traditional video game business they show great potential.Online subscription-based gaming is becoming a confident answer to the question of rampant piracy of disk-based games in Asia. The sale of virtual goods is also providing real revenue growth.Social gaming is exploding as companies exploit the relationships built on online networks such as Facebook. New dynamic advertising is being injected into games played over the internet, and sales of episodic content are being explored online.Video game publishers are excited at the possibility of full console games being served over the internet, which would cut out their distribution costs, as well as the revenues they lose in the practice of trading second-hand games. This generates an estimated $2bn a year in the US but does not benefit publishers.But in the shift to an online delivery model, there will be losers as well as winners.Retailers such as GameStop will suffer a hit to sales of packaged goods and used games, while console makers face a challenge as the need for high-powered machines to play disk-based games recedes.OnLive, a start-up company that demonstrated this year how fully featured console games could be played without discernible time lag over a broadband network, has brought the question over the future of consoles to the fore.“The question is whether there is a role for a shiny disk in the future. We’ve seen an attack on retail physical goods,” says Mitch Lasky, a partner at the Benchmark Capital venture capital firm and a former senior executive at Electronic Arts.“The next-generation console may be more like a small internet hub . . . with a limited amount of storage.”New games consoles for the home – successors to Sony’s Playstation, or Microsoft’s Xbox – would be due next year, according to the five-year cycle that has been repeating itself since 1990, but no new models are scheduled to be released.“This has felt like a 10-year cycle to us,” says John Riccitiello, Electronic Arts chief executive.Referring to the current console models’ high specifications, he adds: “It doesn’t get better than 1080p [or high definition], and the processors are still very powerful.”Paul Jackson, video game analyst with Forrester Research, says: “There is at least one more generation [of consoles] waiting in the wings, but that will probably be the last iteration of this almost ludicrously overpowered device which is primarily designed to play games.”In spite of price cuts for consoles by Sony and Microsoft in recent days, prices still have some way to fall, as does the cost of manufacturing the current generation of consoles.Their makers and the third-party games publishers have no appetite for the big investments and risks involved in coming up with new consoles.What console makers will do, however, to extend the cycle and maintain sales momentum is come up with different versions of existing consoles, refresh interfaces, add accessories and broaden their capabilities – to entering virtual worlds online, social networking and enjoying services such as HD films.Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities, expects Nintendo to come out with a high-definition version of the Wii in 2010. Sony and Microsoft are due to launch new motion-sensing controllers, to try to emulate the success of the Wii. ”These guys have migrated from the old ’Take it or leave it, this is the console we’re making model’ to ’This is more like a TV and we’re going to give you a bigger screen or surround sound,’” he says.“With these richer feature sets, they’re going to milk this generation for another five or six years.”As for handheld consoles, Nintendo admitted in July that sales of its DS were being hit by the popularity of smartphones such as Apple’s iPhone and iPod Touch, games which can sell for less than a third of the price of those on a DS or Sony’s PSP.Sony itself is reported to be working on a mobile phone-based gaming device.The emergence of the iPhone platform, for which thousands of games are available, has created a cottage industry of developers, but left publishers struggling to sell enough games.“Right now, the challenge we have is that [the iPhone platform] doesn’t support the level of investment [that a larger company makes],” says Greg Ballard, chief executive of Glu Mobile, a mobile game publisher.“But we are actually quite optimistic that more opportunities are going to evolve, it’s growing like a weed,” he adds.Social networks are having a big influence on gaming habits. Players are more likely to become hooked on certain games if they are playing against friends, relatives or co-workers online.The Xbox interface is being updated with links to Twitter and Facebook.Zynga, a young company tapping Facebook’s 250m members, has overtaken Yahoo Games to become the leading online game company with 66m active monthly users, according to comScore.Social gaming appears to be another route to expanding the demographics of gaming. The number of Americans playing games grew from 166m to 170m last year, or around 55 per cent of the population. The industry has to increase this proportion on a global basis - attracting more non-gamers is key to maintaining its growth.
192;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-08-31T22:39:20Z;Apple to host music event next week;;"Apple on Monday announced that it will hold a media event on September 9 in San Francisco, where the company is expected to make a number of music-themed announcements, possibly including a new line of iPods and the availability of the Beatles’ catalogue of records through the iTunes store.September 9 also marks the date that Electronic Arts will release The Beatles: Rock Band, the highly anticipated video game. Apple-watchers see the timing as more than coincidental. Apple has traditionally made its September announcements on a Tuesday, but this one is being held on Wednesday.Apple has previously used September media events to introduce a refreshed line of iPods. Analysts expect a new line of iPod Touches that include video cameras, which would put the
device in more direct competition with the Flip, the popular pocket-sized camcorder.Sales of iPods have slowed in the past two years as Apple has begun selling more iPhones, which include all the functionality of iPods. But the iPod product line is still important for Apple, appealing to customers who do not have an iPhone.The company’s rumoured touch-screen tablet is not expected to be unveiled at next week’s event. Analysts now expect the tablet to be unveiled in January.What could be announced is Apple’s partnership with the four largest record labels, which the Financial Times first reported in July.The partnership, codenamed “Cocktail”, will reportedly include the debut of new interactive album material to supplement online music sales from the iTunes store.The notoriously secretive company provided few details on the event, and declined to say which products would be announced. It is also unclear whether Steve Jobs, chief executive, will appear at the event."
193;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-08-06T01:12:45Z;Activision results cast shadow over rival EA;;Activision Blizzard reaffirmed its position as the dominant video game publisher by reporting another strong quarter on Wednesday, one day after its rival, Electronic Arts, reported widening losses and shrinking revenue.Activision Blizzard, based in Santa Monica, reported profits of $195m, up from $28m a year earlier. The drastically improved results are thanks to the success of Activision’s union with Blizzard, the Vivendi Games unit with which it completed a merger one year ago.The sevenfold increase in profits was largely due to an increase in subscribers to Blizzard Entertainment’s World of Warcraft, as well as strong sales of two games pegged to summer movies, and the enduring popularity of the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero franchises.”Since our merger one year ago, we have delivered better-than-expected financial performance for four consecutive quarters,” said Activision Blizzard chief executive Robert Kotick. Revenues at the company were $1bn, up from $352m a year ago.On Tuesday Electronic Arts reported that losses widened and revenues fell over the past three months. EA, based in Redwood City, lost $234m in the three months through July, compared with $95m during the same time last year.“The industry is weaker than we originally expected and we remain cautious,” Electronic Arts chief executive John Riccitiello said on Tuesday.But the world’s second-largest video game maker had a better than expected quarter thanks to some well-timed releases. Sales of The Sims 3, the latest release in one of the industry’s best-selling franchises, and EA Sports Active, a new title for the Nintendo Wii.The starkly differing quarters for the two largest pure-play video game makers underscores the importance of enduring franchises, and the reliability of the hard-core gaming market even amidst the recession.“The guys with hard-core games tend to do better than the casual guys,” said Michael Pachter, video game analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities. He pointed to poor results from Ubisoft and Nintendo, the two leading casual gaming companies.Strong results from Activision Blizzard, however, do not signal the wholesale revival of the video game industry. US videogame sales dropped 31 per cent in June, from $1.7bn a year earlier to $1.17bn, according NPD Group.“We haven’t turned around,” said Mr Pachter. But, he said, “starting in September things are going to be gigantic.” A torrent of new releases is slated in advance of the holiday season. “It’s crowded in a good way,” he said.Activision Blizzard will be releasing new titles in several of its franchises, including Call of Duty, Guitar Hero, and Tony Hawk. But analysts were less optimistic about Electronic Arts’ release schedule. Mild enthusiasm for forthcoming titles such as Dragon Age Origins and Dante’s Inferno sent shares in EA tumbling in late trading on Wednesday.
194;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-08-05T21:02:17Z;Banks buck wider Wall St retreat;;"US stocks declined on Wednesday but the benchmark S&P 500 index managed to stay above 1,000 as the market pared some of its early losses sparked by downbeat economic data.The ADP employment report suggested that private employers cut more jobs in July than expected, which weighed on markets at the start of trading.Equities then extended those losses following the release of figures showing output in the service sector in July was weaker than expected.The ADP report is considered an indication of the unemployment rate, which will be released on Friday, and investors focused on this more than the Challenger jobs report, which suggested fewer companies announced job cuts in July than a year ago.But positive words from UK bank Lloyds, which said that its loan impairments had peaked, along with figures showing mortgage applications rose more than 4 per cent last week, drove buying in US bank stocks even in the face of negative data.Citigroup rose 10.2 per cent to $3.58 while Bank of America rose 6.5 per cent to $16.66 and Wells Fargo gained 5.7 per cent to $28.02.After the closing bell, Cisco and News Corp released their quarterly earnings and both companies beat estimates.Industrial stocks were the significant drag, led lower by Quanta, the biggest US builder of powerlines, which missed earnings estimates after being hurt by continuing weakness in the energy sector. Its shares fell 1.2 per cent to $23.17.The S&P dropped 0.3 per cent to 1,002.72, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to close at 9,280.97.The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.9 per cent to 1,993.05.“The economic news suggests that the economy is bottoming but the turn is going to be slow,” said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments.There were mixed signs on consumer activity as several blue-chip companies reported quarterly results. Shares in Whole Foods, the upmarket grocery chain, bounced 15.6 per cent to $28.70 after the company beat estimates for sales, profits and margins.Kraft also showed resilience in the food sector after the company, which counts Oreo cookies among its well-known brands, beat analysts’ expectations and raised its full-year profit outlook.But the shares slipped a fraction lower to $28.33
following a recent spike on the back of similarly good numbers from rivals General Mills and Kellogg’s.There were more negative signs on customer spending, however, from Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer group.The company’s revenues disappointed Wall Street and, even though earnings were slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations and the company maintained its full-year guidance, its shares fell 2.8 per cent to $53.91.Meanwhile, Polo Ralph Lauren, the clothing company, rose 7.1 per cent to $68.31 after stronger sales and cheaper supply chain costs helped the company post stronger profits and margins than expected.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Electronic Arts saw its shares rise
following impressive results, fuelled by strong sales of The Sims 3 video-game and tight cost
controls.But the stock ultimately lost 6.8 per cent to $20.40, after John Riccitiello, chief executive, warned of continued weakness in the sector, saying orders from retailers remained low.Garmin jumped 23.8 per cent to $33.66 after the satellite navigation system maker beat its earnings estimates and significantly improved profit margins following steep cost cuts.Two of the best-known car rental companies found gains. Shares in Dollar Thrifty rose 14.2 per cent to $20.02 after the company exceeded estimates, having successfully raised its prices and cut costs last year.Some industry analysts now predict the company could become a takeover target for a bigger rival.One of those rivals, Avis, announced a quarterly loss with rental volumes remaining low. But the shares closed up 5 per cent to $9.39 as the company said demand had begun to stabilise."
195;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-08-04T22:33:19Z;Mixed results for EA;;Electronic Arts reported that losses widened and revenues fell over the past three months. But the world’s second-largest videogame maker had a better than expected quarter thanks to some well-timed releases.Even as overall spending on videogames is down, EA results were bolstered by strong sales of “The Sims 3″, the latest release in one of the industry’s best-selling franchises, and “EA Sports Active”, a new title for the Nintendo Wii. EA lost $234m in the three months through July, compared with $95m during the same time last year.EA didn’t adjust its forecast for the year, an indication that despite this solid quarter, the videogame industry could continue to suffer for months to come.
196;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Japanese game makers;;"Forget nuclear devastation and sweet-faced girls who morph into psychokillers. Off screen, the real villains of the game publishing industry are more menacing. Console sales are down. Hit titles are rare. Piracy and rampant second-hand sales, meanwhile, lurk like demon monsters, gobbling up revenues.Platitudes about the industry’s supposedly recession-proof characteristics – weeks of fun for less than the price of dinner out – are toast. Moody’s Investors Services on Tuesday added its voice to the woeful chorus surrounding Japanese game software publishers when it downgraded the sector’s outlook to stable. This follows a ropey run of data. North American sales of gaming hardware, software and accessories fell 25 per cent year-on-year in June based on volumes, according to NPD, a consultancy. In Japan, a nation of gamers, software sales dropped 47 per cent over the same period, according to Enterbrain.There have been glimmers of cheer since, notably Square Enix’s latest Dragon Quest venture for handheld gamers, which sold 3m copies in the first three days. Expectations are high for the September release of Beatles Rock Band, developed by Harmonix of the US. But these are blips compared with last year’s fast action release schedule. The fear is that by failing to develop must-have content, game makers are losing their appeal even as consoles become cheaper and proliferate further.That concern is reflected by Japanese publishers’ share prices, down about 20 per cent in the year to date. The sector has massively underperformed the broader market, as well as US peers such as Electronic Arts, up 33 per cent over the same period. Depending where you see earnings going, valuations may appear attractive but the absence of any market catalyst makes buying now a bold bet. Game over?

197;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-07-12T22:05:10Z;Swiss tax rules lure McDonald’s from UK;;McDonald’s is to leave London for Geneva, joining the growing ranks of US companies moving their European headquarters to take advantage of preferential intellectual property tax laws.The fast-food group, which will open its head office in the Swiss city in the autumn, said the move had been almost a year in the planning.The Swiss tax regime, particularly for intellectual property, has become increasingly attractive for foreign companies, particularly the regional European headquarters of US multinationals.Kraft, Procter & Gamble, Google, Electronic Arts and Yahoo have switched from the UK to Switzerland in recent years, while Informa, the UK publisher, is changing its tax domicile to the country.McDonald’s said its decision was not prompted by changes in the UK taxation of foreign profits from intellectual property rights made by Alastair Darling, the finance minister, this year. However, the company said the move “enables us to conduct the strategic management of key international intellectual property rights, including the licensing of those rights to our franchisees in Europe, from Switzerland”.McDonald’s has spread much of its operations around six or seven cities in Europe, but its headquarters has long been in London, where it opened its first outlet in 1974.The growing success of Switzerland, Luxembourg and Ireland at attracting multinationals is causing disquiet in European centres such as London, although the Swiss lifestyle and efficient transport have also been cited as contributing factors behind corporate decisions.Under the UK tax rules that came into force at the start of the month, McDonald’s would be paying tax on foreign profits relating to intellectual property twice over.The group, which said its UK business would remain unaffected, also said it expected its overall British annual tax rate to remain unchanged at about 30 per cent.Several senior members of McDonald’s Europe’s management team will relocate to Geneva, including including Denis Hennequin, president of McDonald’s operations in Europe.The issue of companies moving their main centre of operations outside the UK has dogged the UK Treasury.Mr Darling last year bowing to pressure and scrapped reforms to the taxation of foreign profits that threatened to provoke an exodus of companies from the UK.Since the start of 2008, WPP, Shire, Regus, Henderson, Charter, Beazley, Brit Insurance and UBM have all announced that they are moving their tax base out of the UK.
198;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-07-09T22:16:32Z;E-commerce back in fashion with investors;;Ten years after the first dotcom boom, digital media investors have come full circle: e-commerce is again the buzzword on the lips of London’s venture capital community.When it comes to spotting the dotcom stars of the future, they are once again turning their attention to companies that sell goods or services, rather than those that hope to make money from advertising.Revenues from social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook are still lagging behind the rapid growth in their user bases, and even the mighty Google is still working out how to extract the most value from its $1.65bn (£1bn) acquisition of YouTube. While e-commerce might sound a little dated, for investors it offers the comfort of a familiar business model – selling things for more than they cost to make.“People have a perception that e-commerce has been done but it’s just starting,” says Fred Destin, partner at venture capitalist Atlas Venture. He predicts the rise of “super-niche, high-quality sites” that sell a much greater range of products or services in their chosen niches than the high street could offer.In addition, “the web gives people the ability to deliver a much more personalised experience”, says Saul Klein, partner at Index Ventures.Popular second-generation e-commerce sites include Richard Moross’ Moo.com, which prints individually customised business and greeting cards, and Glasses Direct, which is exploiting the untapped market for online spectacle sales. Online event ticket resellers Viagogo and Seatwave have also attracted substantial investment.Investors are less confident when it comes to selling digital media such as music and movies online. While online jukeboxes such as Spotify are attracting millions of users with their promise of unlimited free music, the strength of their business models remains unclear.“Right now there is not enough [advertising] money to keep subsidising these free offerings,” says Nic Brisbourne, partner at DFJ Esprit. “People have to start paying or make the ads pay better.”But Julie Meyer, chief executive of Ariadne Capital, says Spotify “does look like one that has potential”.Ms Meyer is also bullish on mobile services, which have long been seen as a “black hole” for investors. Ariadne has backed Monitise, a mobile banking company, and Spinvox, which converts voicemail into text messages.Video games are another popular investment. Online video-gaming services such as Playfish are expanding beyond the PlayStation demographic by offering their games (and selling products related to them) on social networking sites such as Facebook.“Most of our users haven’t played video games before,” says Sebastien de Halleux, chief operating officer and co-founder of Playfish. In its first 18 months, 100m Playfish games have been installed, a growth rate which has attracted $21m in venture funding from Accel Partners and Index.Investors in “ social gaming” are betting that the internet will disrupt the video gaming market as much as it has disrupted the music and movie markets. “Gaming is bigger than TV, bigger than music . . . it’s a phenomenal media,” says Mr Destin.“The next stage will be start-ups going after the core business model of Electronic Arts”, one of the world’s largest console games publishers.Online business applications are also popular with venture capitalists. As people become more used to the slick user experiences provided by Google, Yahoo and Facebook, they become less tolerant of older, clunkier business applications.Huddle, an online collaboration service, is among the British companies tapping into this “consumerisation of the enterprise”.“Users and revenues are doubling every three to four months at the moment,” says co-founder Andy McLoughlin, with customers including Centrica and Diageo.Huddle also runs DrinkTank, a regular informal gathering of tech entrepreneurs. Mr McLoughlin says he has seen valuations “really dip” for start-ups raising new funds, with investors demanding more equity for less money.In spite of that, many entrepreneurs see the recession as the best time to launch a business. It is cheaper to hire staff and marketing costs are lower.“There’s a massive difference in the cost of setting up a business today”, compared with 10 years ago, says Michael Acton Smith, who founded Firebox.com, the online gadget seller, in 1998. “Now one or two guys with a few hundred or thousand pounds can set up a site and test it. And a lot more people are trying.”
199;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-06-29T21:54:20Z;Social game groups scrap over virtual spoils;;Social gaming, where social networks become venues for virtual pets and fantasy mob wars, is becoming a real world battleground for industry players trying to cash in on the phenomenon.The console industry is exploring social gaming, traditional video game companies are losing top executives to the sector and there is infighting among the new wave of developers as they seek to copy each other’s successes.Popular games such as Farm Town and Pet Society are attracting more than 10m players on sites like Facebook, and virtual goods – from cars to clothing and weapons – are earning millions of dollars.“Social gaming could be as big as social networking,” said Mark Pincus, chief executive of Zynga, the leading social gaming company, at the second annual Social Gaming Summit last week.“I think that all gaming will be social and I believe all [online] experiences will be social,” said Gareth Davis, head of social gaming at Facebook, which has 225m active members worldwide. “We have over 10,000 sites using Facebook Connect now.”Facebook Connect allows members to take their Facebook friends with them to other sites and devices – they can play games with friends on the iPhone and soon the Xbox 360, as well as share photos from Nintendo’s DSi handheld console later this summer.Mr Davis told the summit that while social games had not been a priority for traditional publishers a year ago, they were beginning to design games from scratch with social networks in mind.Socialising games can lead to the viral growth in popularity of virtual items. Playdom’s Sorority Life game moved $100,000 worth of suddenly fashionable virtual Volkswagens in two days recently, while Playfish’s Pet Society sold 20m Christmas trees and ornaments to virtual homeowners.Industry analysts estimate the cottage industry of social gaming will earn $300m to $400m in revenues this year, compared with around $500m for Facebook, which has focused on advertising sales. Zynga is set to earn revenues of around $100m this year, according to industry estimates.Both Facebook and MySpace are exploring how they can make revenues from providing virtual currencies to gamers, while the Hi5 social network has turned itself into a “social entertainment” site focused on gaming.As part of an exodus from the traditional video game industry, John Pleasants this month became the biggest name to switch over to the smaller startups. He left his post as chief operating officer at Electronic Arts to become chief executive of Playdom.“The rates of growth are ones you don’t normally see in 18 to 24-month-old companies,” says Charles Hudson, co-organiser of the Social Gaming Summit.“They’re going from zero to multi-million dollar companies so quickly that they’re having to deal with management transitions, a shifting competitive landscape and very unclear rules.”Last week, Zynga sued Playdom, alleging its competing Mob Wars game was running misleading advertisements on Facebook meant to steal Zynga’s business. Zynga wants Playdom to run a series of clarifying advertisements on Facebook and claims damages as a result of lost business.“It seems like everybody is suing everybody right now,” says Justin Smith, editor of Inside Social Games.“It’s a major issue the industry will need to resolve before it can move beyond a certain point.“Early on, the best practices have been to borrow elements from the most popular games and that’s started to play out in the courts.”
200;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-06-24T07:16:10Z;Social gaming platforms closer to cashing in;;Facebook appears to be moving closer to cashing in on the social gaming phenomenon it has created on its platform and, judging by the numbers being quoted at the second annual Social Gaming Summit, that can’t come soon enough.In a session on Tuesday featuring executives from leading social-gaming publishers, John Pleasants, the new chief executive of Playdom, revealed its Sorority Life game received feedback from users this month asking for cars as virtual goods, with a pink Volkswagen in particular receiving strong support. Playdom came up with the goods and sold $100,000 worth of virtual VWs in two days.In another example, Sebastien de Halleux, co-founder of Playfish, said its Pet Society game had sold 20m virtual Christmas trees and ornaments, with players using credits they had amassed from playing the game or paying $2 an item.None of this money found its way into the pocket of Facebook, which is the biggest such gaming platform with more than 200m people using the social network worldwide.Gareth Davis, its head of social gaming, told me the virtual currency of Facebook credits it uses in its gift shop was being extended to transactions in applications, although this was still at a very early testing stage.“Developers have been asking for this for a long time. It can reduce the friction,” he said.“Users are more likely to transact in Facebook, developers see a fall-off when consumers are redirected to a third-party site.”Those third-party payment providers would be happy to provide their technology to a Facebook or MySpace or Twitter.Jason Bailey, chief executive of Super Rewards, told me Twitter should come up with technology, called Twitterpay perhaps, which would provide a payment service for game publishers and take a 30 per cent cut for itself on sales, just as Apple does from developers in its iPhone App Store.“We’ve been doing this for a long time, there’s a lot of time and effort that goes into this, so Twitter’s best bet to make that happen would be to partner with somebody like myself,” he said.Super Rewards said on Tuesday it had come up with the first way to make money from Twitter games, with its service supporting the Twitter-linked game 140 Mafia - a similar concept to the recent Twitter Spymaster craze.Another current trend raised at the conference was the growing interest of the traditional video game industry in social gaming. This has seen executives moving to social-gaming publishers, such as Mr Pleasants’ move from Electronic Arts last week, and the console makers and publishers incorporating social networking.EA has allowed players of its Tiger Woods golf game to post their achievements for friends on Facebook to see, while Facebook Connect is bringing social gaming to the Xbox and Nintendo DSi, as Gareth Davis explains in this audioBoo.At the conference, he said he was impressed by how “the traditional games industry…is not just thinking about how to make their games social, but they’re thinking about how to make fundamentally social games. A year ago, this really wasn’t on the traditional game industry’s radar, but this year there’s definitely been an inflection point.”Mark Pincus, founder and chief executive of Zynga, another leading player, said he believed social gaming could be as big as social networking.A bold statement perhaps, but there were no dissenters in the room.
201;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-06-18T21:49:36Z;Top execs abandon consoles for social gaming;;Anyone doubting that social gaming is the next big growth area for the video-game industry should note which way top executives in the industry are moving.Electronic Arts has just announced that John Pleasants (pictured), its chief operating officer and president of global publishing, is leaving the company. His destination is the chief executive role at Playdom, the leading social game developer on MySpace.This follows Monday’s announcement that Simon Jeffery, former president and COO of Sega America, had joined ngmoco, the iPhone game publisher led by former EA executive Neil Young.Mr Jeffery will lead its Plus+ Publishing group, a new initiative designed to take advantage of the latest OS 3.0 software for the iPhone, which will boost social networking in games.Mr Pleasants, who had been at EA for just over a year in his key strategic role,  said in a press release:“I’m thrilled to join Playdom. Online gaming is the fastest-growing sector of the gaming industry, and social gaming, in particular, is transforming the way people play and experience games.”EA said John Schappert, who left the company in 2007 to head Microsoft’s Game Studios and Xbox Live, would return in July to take up Mr Pleasants’ role.
202;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-06-11T22:32:07Z;Video game hardware sales slump 30 per cent;;Video-game industry sales are continuing to slump in the US, with NPD figures for May released this evening showing a 23 per cent drop year-on-year, with falls led by hardware sales.It’s hard to imagine any improvement till the holiday season, barring early price cuts for the consoles. Major game releases also seem to be “back-end loaded”, compared to last year, when there were big hits earlier in the year, such as Grand Theft Auto IV (GTA).John Riccitiello, Electronic Arts chief executive, told me at the E3 show last week that a weak March and April had been no surprise to him – he had predicted mid-single-digit growth for the industry at the beginning of the year, when analysts were forecasting 10 per cent growth or more.“We’re not particularly nervous about the last couple of months and what was anyone expecting when you compare it to GTA and Wii Fit [the year before]?” he said.As we predicted last week, THQ’s UFC 2009 Undisputed was the top game, selling just over 1m units, with Wii Fit still performing well in second with 353,000 units and EA’s new Sports Active (pictured), which also takes advantage of the balance board accessory, close behind on 346,000.Hardware sales were down 30 per cent on a year ago at $302m, with sales of the Wii continuing to decline markedly, from 340,000 in April to 290,000 in May.“The video games industry continues to struggle with difficult comparisons to last year, and this is the first month that industry sales have dipped below $1bn since August 2007,” said Anita Frazier, analyst with the NPD research firm.Not much to shout about for the console makers then. The best Microsoft can come up with in its press release is: “Xbox 360 system sales hit 175,000 units in May, showing the most year-over-year resilience of any console.”Nintendo touts sales of the DS handheld, which were strong, with the new DSi version now boosting the product, at 633,000 units. Sony, whose PS3 sales barely outstripped its PS2 ones (131,000 to 117,000) has yet to comment.
203;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-06-07T21:38:23Z;EA v THQ in martial-arts fight;;The top-selling video game for May on the latest consoles is unlikely to be disputed. UFC 2009 Undisputed, released on May 19, shipped 2m copies in its first two weeks, according to its publisher THQ, and looks likely to top the NPD charts when the research firm releases its figures on Thursday.It’s a sign of the growing popularity of the Ultimate Fighting Championship and the sport of mixed martial arts. It’s also a signal for THQ’s competitors, namely Electronic Arts, to seek a piece of the action.At its E3 press conference this week, EA said it had a strategy to “re-energise and redefine the fight category.” As well as the release of its Fight Night Round 4 boxing game on June 25, it announced a new global franchise in EA Sports MMA, as in Mixed Martial Arts, due for release in 2010.It promised a “vast array of top fighters from around the world” would bring a new authenticity to one of the world’s faster growing sports.That sounds ominous for THQ. EA is a rival in a higher weight category and it has any number of successful sports franchises from Madden NFL to FIFA soccer and Tiger Woods golf.However, Brian Farrell, THQ’s chief executive, was bullish when I met him at E3. His company has just undergone a painful restructuring, but it is renowned for its fighting games, in particular the WWE wrestling franchise, which sold about 4.5m units for THQ last year.“The licence that we control – UFC – is the definitive leader in the category,” he said.“We have the league, we have all the fighters, so EA seems a little late to the party. We’ve got a great competitive advantage and we use some of the tech that we’ve had for ten years for building wrestling games.”I later put these advantages to John Riccitiello, EA chief executive, and he seemed undaunted.“Most of the athletes in mixed martial arts are unaffiliated,” he said.“Harking back to 1999, we didn’t have an NFL licence and Acclaim did and we outsold them with a players’ licence, and we quickly got an NFL licence after that. Brian’s UFC game is already doing really well, but we feel that frankly there’s room for competition and we’re not afraid of it.”So it sounds like both are talking a good fight. Look out for Round One in 2010.
204;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-05-13T15:17:34Z;Futurephile: ‘IT will step in on my day off’;;Nanea Reeves, senior vice-president online at videogames vendor Electronic Arts, forecasts the future.How will IT change?Videogames will have a huge influence on the hardware and software used by business, driving up speed, visual appeal and interactivity.What will business IT look like in 2012?Executives will develop their leadership skills by playing games. A game forces you to make decisions. There’s a lot of crossover between the technology used for games and for high-end financial modelling. I could see would-be quantitative analysts and hedge fund staff playing games called Crazy Quants and Hedge Fund Manager to hone their skills.What will be new in public sector IT in 2012?We’ll see a lot more use of videogames hardware and software for simulating battlefield scenarios in defence. We’ll start to see more educational software that includes mini games.How will individuals use IT in 2012?They will play games that span multiple platforms. You will start the game on the web and interact with it on your phone, perhaps being able to order extra firepower via a mobile.What will business look like in 2020?People will spend more time in virtual worlds. Real businesses will emerge in these environments and they will offer new services that will drive up traffic further.What about the public sector in 2020?Gaming environments will be used more extensively in education.How will IT be used by individuals in 2020?At present consumers often pay several times to get the same content on different technology: iPods, cable TV, mobile phones and so on. If I buy content from my cable provider, I should be able to access the same movie on my mobile and in my hotel room.What’s going to happen in networking?The biggest thing will be the move towards the server. You won’t need as much processing power in the device in your hand because more will be in the cloud network of computers.How will we acquire knowledge?We will learn by creating environments in virtual worlds such as Second Life and seeing what works. It is amazing what they have done at Linden Lab, maker of Second Life. I can create a store and products and sell them to you.What changes will we see in video games?Multi-player gaming is the most exciting area. Leagues of players will develop and the top leagues will be like a new country club. Future games will be less linear in plot terms.How do you see artificial intelligence developing?I can see a day when I rent artificial intelligence online when I’m too busy to play a multi-player videogame, so I don’t lose status in the game. Or when I use AI to keep tasks moving when I need a day off work.What will happen in 2050 and beyond?Nanotechnology will make the videogame less video-based and more tactile and immersive. You will be able to feel the bullet hitting you or that you are entering a real space.

206;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-05-07T21:02:39Z;Activision Blizzard conquers expectations;;Activision Blizzard, the leading video game publisher, reported quarterly revenues and profits well ahead of expectations as its Guitar Hero, Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises helped it ride out the downturn.However, the Santa Monica-based company was conservative in raising its forecast for the year, citing continuing economic uncertainty.Activision Blizzard reported sales of $724m in its first quarter, compared to its prior outlook of $550m on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes certain items such as deferred costs and sales for its online games. Earnings per share were 8 cents - 5 cents higher than previously forecast.The company said there had been ”strong global consumer response” to its top three franchises ”despite challenging economic times.”Its Guitar Hero World Tour was the top selling third-party title - excluding Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft first-party titles - in the US, while sales of Guitar Hero in Europe were up 84 per cent year-on-year, according to video game research firms.The publisher acquired 7 Studios last month to broaden its development capabilities in the music genre and plans several new releases this year, including Guitar Hero V, Band Hero and DJ Hero, which will focus on club music.”We are now covering the broadest swathe of audience, the broadest geographies and with entry points at all price points and in all categories in music,” said Bobby Kotick, chief executive, in a Financial Times interview.His company’s performance was in contrast to its closest rival, Electronic Arts, which markets the Rock Band game and reported a quarterly loss of 37 cents a share this week. EA complained of softness in the music category, reporting it was down 36 per cent in the first quarter.Activision Blizzard raised its outlook for the calendar year to non-GAAP sales of $4.8bn, from $4.7bn and earnings per share of 63 cents, up from 61 cents.”While we have a lot of confidence in our slate, there’s still a lot of macroeconomic uncertainty, and our general strategy is always to be fairly cautious about the outlook,” said Mr Kotick.Earlier in the day, Nintendo had forecast flat sales and falling profits this year, but Mr Kotick, whose company is the leading third-party publisher on the platform, said he saw the Wii console continuing to have strength in the US and European markets.
207;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-05-01T01:25:56Z;Hasbro joins Discovery to take on Disney;;Hasbro and Discovery Communications are joining forces to take on Walt Disney, Viacom’s Nickelodeon and Time Warner’s Cartoon Network in the crowded but lucrative children’s television market.The toymaker behind Tonka trucks and Scrabble will inject $300m for a 50 per cent stake of a new cable television and online venture with the owner of the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet.It has also guaranteed a further $125m over five years in merchandising royalties, offering a third revenue stream on top of Discovery’s cable subscription fees and advertising sales, said David Zaslav, chief executive.“We’ve watched from afar Disney and Nickelodeon with their subscription fees, advertising revenues and merchandising revenues,” he said.Commercial Alert, a lobby group co-founded by Ralph Nader, said it would ask regulators to investigate, arguing that the joint venture was “nothing more than a scheme to deliver programme-length advertisements to children over television”.Discovery called the criticism “unfounded and presumptuous”, and Mr Zaslav voiced confidence that the new channel would find room in the market, noting that each older demographic was served by 40-50 channels.Hasbro properties, such as Trivial Pursuit and Cranium, coupled with existing programming from the Discovery Kids channel, such as Bindi the Jungle Girl, would create “a strong new brand for children’s entertainment and education”, Mr Zaslav said.For Hasbro, the initiative marks the latest move to broaden the audience for some of its oldest toy brands. A film based on its 45-year-old GI Joe action figure will be released by Viacom’s Paramount this year, along with a sequel to the 2007 Transformers movie.A video games tie-up with Electronic Arts had given its brands “new lives”, creating some of the most popular online and mobile games and helping boost Mono-poly’s board game sales by 40 per cent in recent years, said Brian Goldner, Hasbro chief executive.The new channel is due to launch in the US late next year, taking over from Discovery Kids, which is in 60m US homes. Discovery will look to distribute shows around the world in time.Hasbro said it had arranged to borrow up to $200m to finance the investment.The investment comes as cable television channels are showing resilient growth.A souring economy has meant “people are spending more time at home”, Mr Zaslav said, adding that Discovery had seen almost double-digit growth in the first quarter.
208;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Sony’s Free Realms takes on Runescape;;Sony opened its online kingdom Free Realms on Wednesday – its response to the success of the browser-based role-playing game, Runescape.Britain’s Jagex has found a lucrative market among pre-teen boys and girls for Runescape, which has similarities to the world’s most successful online role-playing game World of Warcraft.However, while WoW needs to be bought and installed as a desktop program along with a monthly subscription, Runescape will play inside any browser and on a laptop or PC with the most basic graphics capabilities.It is also free, although the company makes money from premium subscriptions and is growing at around 35 per cent a year.While Runescape has attracted around 6m players a month, Sony is aiming for tens of millions of users with Free Realms.The game differs from WoW and Runescape in not confining players to professions, factions or guilds. Sony says players can be a ninja one minute and a go-kart driver the next.While the game is launched from the browser, it takes the form of a full-screen downloaded client, with the website being used to store account information and introduce social networking elements.Electronic Arts has taken the same approach with Battlefield Heroes, a Second World War role-playing game still in beta. EA’s free game allows players to choose between being a soldier, gunner and commando and fight in one of two rival armies. They can drive tanks and jeeps and fly a plane. Virtual goods such as outfits, guns and abilities, such as being able to run faster, can be purchased.Sony expects to earn most of its revenues from virtual goods, but it has the same $5 a month premium subscription as Runescape. It has also introduced both a virtual- and physical-world trading-card game for Free Realms.Sony and EA’s games mark the entry of the major publishers into virtual worlds for younger players. It will be interesting to see what impact they can have and whether theirs is the right approach to a market largely created by smaller independent companies to date.
209;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-03-27T18:17:55Z;Eidos approves takeover by Square Enix;;UK investors will soon bid farewell to the last London-listed video games company after Eidos, the creator of Lara Croft, approved a takeover by Square Enix, a larger Japanese rival.Long-suffering shareholders in Eidos approved a 32p a share bid with only a minority of small private investors voting against. The deal values the Tomb Raider developer at £84.3m.The company, which was created from a combination of Eidos and SCi Entertainment in 2005, raised £60m in a fundraising less than a year ago at 35p a share.The vote appears to dash any remaining hopes of a rival bid from Time Warner, a 20 per cent shareholder in Eidos.The acquisition will be completed through a scheme of arrangement, with Eidos shares due to be suspended on April 21, with cancellation on May 6.Despite the rapid fall in the company’s share price in the past two years, Phil Rogers, Eidos chief executive, said: “This is good for our shareholders as it gives them the certainty that many have welcomed.”He said it would take the company to a “new level”.Eidos warned in January that it could face a funding shortfall after sales of the latest Tomb Raider game disappointed over Christmas. It then expected sales of £160m to £180m this year. This month it revealed that the release of Championship Manager, another flagship title, would be delayed, citing quality concerns.Eidos was originally acquired by SCi, a smaller games company, in 2005. Eidos was effectively forced to put itself up for sale in 2004 when it found itself too small to compete with bigger global operators such as Electronic Arts and Activision. SCi changed its name back to Eidos last year.Jane Cavanagh and Bill Ennis, SCi’s founding management, were ousted in January last year after failing to agree a takeover bid and warning on profits. SCi’s shares were worth 386p when it announced bid talks in September 2007.Ms Cavanagh, who still holds a stake in Eidos of about 3 per cent, said: “Square Enix have got the deal of the century.”
210;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-03-23T07:05:56Z;Zeebo takes aim at emerging markets;;A games console powered by mobile phone parts and aimed at emerging markets will be launched on Monday.The Zeebo console is being unveiled at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, targeting developers and publishers that would like to expand in new markets without fear of piracy.For consumers in Brazil, where it will be sold initially, Zeebo offers affordable and instant access to popular video games through downloads over a free, secure, 3G wireless connection.“Instead of the consumer having to take a bus and go to a favela [shanty town] to buy pirated software, they can sit on their couch, turn on the Zeebo console and buy directly from home,” said John Rizzo, Zeebo’s chief executive.His San Diego-based company is backed by Qualcomm, the largest maker of mobile phone chips and supplier of the processor, graphics, software and 3G connection in the console.Qualcomm says it is moving beyond the phone, with its chips and software now capable of powering netbooks and new kinds of consumer electronics devices.“The Amazon Kindle is a good example – an electronic book reader where giving it wireless connectivity has added this magic sauce where people buy books and they just appear on the device,” said Mike Yuen, senior director of games and services at Qualcomm.The largest console makers – Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo – and major publishers have generally shunned emerging markets, with profits hard to come by because of rampant piracy and consumers having less disposable income.The latest consoles cost about $1,000 in Brazil on the grey market, while an older PlayStation 2 sells for $250 and needs a $50 modification to run pirated software. The Zeebo console will cost $200 with four pre-installed games and the company will sell further titles for about $12 each, slightly more than the $10 paid on average for illegal titles.The business model has already won backing from leading publishers including Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts. The latter is offering popular titles Need for Speed Carbon and FIFA 09, featuring a Portuguese voiceover, at launch.Zeebo plans to launch in Brazil in May, in Mexico in the third quarter, India and Russia in 2010 and China in 2011.“The barrier to entry has been income, not broadband – cell phones have penetrated all these markets,” said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities.“This is a very substantial unexploited niche that could ultimately have 200m-300m addressable households, if not more.”
211;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

213;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-03-04T22:28:57Z;Activision;;"Collecting points in a computer game serves little purpose other than bragging rights over other players. Yet big tech companies often behave the same way, building up large piles of cash in the name of flexibility. However, Activision – the world’s largest publisher of computer games since merging with Blizzard Entertainment last year in a deal that gave French media conglomerate Vivendi 54 per cent of the company – may be tempted to use the $3bn of cash lying idle on its balance sheet. Successful integration of Blizzard has boosted management credibility with investors, while the credit crunch has helpfully lowered valuations for potential targets.Who might be in the gunsights? Activision’s recent success has been built on the Guitar Hero franchise (with over $1bn in sales worldwide), and Call of Duty, a soldiering shoot ’em up. So the sporting games of Take Two might round out its portfolio. With Take Two shares currently worth $500m, it would also be a finger in the eye of competitor Electronic Arts, which eventually withdrew a $2bn bid for the company last year.Yet profitable and growing Activision has typically pursued a strategy of buying small studios or intellectual property. Indeed the rights to Guitar Hero were picked up for a mere $100m. It has then concentrated on a narrow selection of big franchises, plus Blizzard’s World of Warcraft – which boasts 11.5m online users and means that half of group operating profit now comes from a stable subscription base. Lossmaking Electronic Arts, by comparison, has been a serial acquirer.So Activision should resist letting its cash burn a hole in its pocket. If it must spend, beyond the odd small, opportunistic bargain, then its own shares on a not unreasonable 16 times prospective earnings may be a better bet than empire building. It can always wait for peers to run out of lives.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

But there is still work to do to convince the mass market.Social networking, music downloads and mapping applications were services that, just two years ago, either were not possible on a mobile or were hugely expensive. – both to the content providers and users. “We can now do it very cost effectively,” says Rich Holdsworth, the chief technology officer of optimisation specialists, Wapple.The media industry is keen to seize this opportunity for enhanced mobile content, and this is resulting in what Olaf Swantee, the head of Orange’s global mobile operations, describes as an “explosion” of content designed specifically for the mobile internet.Gaming companies, for example, are developing rich-media games that allow users to link with each other on the move bringing functionality on a par with devices linked to a PC or television. “Handsets can now offer a connected experience, much more like a gaming console,” says Barry Cottle, chief executive of EA Mobile, a division of the gaming company Electronic Arts.This new supply of content is starting to find consumers. Since Apple launched its iPhone App Store – a site with dedicated iPhone applications covering categories from entertainment to finance and social networking – in May 2008, it has had 500m downloads and has generated $120m in revenues, according to publisher Informa.Jin Lee, managing director for the communications and high technology group at consultancy Accenture, points out that Apple went from offering 500 applications to 10,000 in less than six months. “That’s all happening during the downturn,” he says. “This indicates consumers are relying more on their mobile phones as a needed device rather than a luxury, even now.”It is not just the “iPhone” effect, says Mr Swantee at Orange: content consumption using dongles [gadgets that control wireless access] attached to laptops, as well as other handsets, has also been on the rise. He points out that in Moldova, one of the poorest countries in Europe, usage on its mobile broadband network is as high as in the rest of Orange’s footprint in Europe. “We are seeing the same average revenue per user there as we are in our other markets,” he says. “Mobile broadband is taking off in every country, whether it is a highly developed or underdeveloped market.”Yet even with faster networks and better devices, the industry is scrambling to keep up with the changes underway on the fixed internet, which is also becoming a richer experience.Only a couple of years ago, the size of an average web page was 100 kilobytes; today it’s 350KB. “That trend will not change. Things are only getting more sophisticated,” says Randy Cavaiani, vice president, marketing and business development for Novarra, which, like Wapple, optimises the internet for mobiles. “Functions such as RSS feeds and viral tools work well on the laptop, but the challenge is delivering all that over the limited functionality of a handset.”Indeed, most phones still lack some of the most common applications used for streaming video and audio on the internet, such as Flash from Adobe, which appears on most websites, but cannot be read by the majority of devices on the market. Danny Winokur, senior director of business development in the platform business unit at Adobe says the company’s mobile version of the application, Flash Lite, is starting to see widespread adoption on handsets but he added that full Flash has had “limited success”. He says the company is developing a full Flash version that will work on handsets “by the end of this year”.The mobile world also remains highly complex: a popular destination on the mobile web can attract up to 50,000 unique combinations of phones and browsers, which means formatting content 50,000 different ways to make it user-friendly, says Mr Cavaiani at Novarra.“The challenge continues to be fragmentation,” says Mr Cottle at EA. “Everyone believed that we would consolidate on a single platform but today we have even more handsets, platforms, and capabilities.”For now, says Mitch Lazar, managing director in Europe for Connected Life, Yahoo’s mobile and broadband service, the focus will have to be on mobile-specific content, or “using your mobile to get show times and cinema locations rather than the movie itself”.He says: “The priority now is for publishers to think about mobile first experiences. It’s not about taking the PC and shoving it into the phone. It’s about how best to develop the real estate and the experience to engage the audience.”"
215;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-02-12T05:55:14Z;Activision bucks trend with record results;;Activision Blizzard, the largest video game publisher, reported recession-resistant results on Wednesday, with record revenues and profits, in sharp contrast to the fortunes of rivals.However, its shares fell as much as 9 per cent in after-hours trading to $8.60 as forecasts for its March quarter of $550m in sales fell short of analyst expectations of $628m. The publisher of best-selling franchises Call of Duty, Guitar Hero and World of Warcraft said it had surpassed profits and sales targets a year ahead of plan for the merger of Activision and Vivendi’s games division, which was completed last July.For the busy December quarter, it reported $2.3bn in revenues and a profit of $429m or 31 cents a share on a non-GAAP basis. It exceeded $5bn in revenues for 2008, after forecasting that it would achieve $4.3bn in revenues only in 2009.Bobby Kotick, chief executive, told the Financial Times that Activision was forecasting revenue growth and margin expansion this year on a constant currency basis. “The market is growing for people who have the very highest quality, most-appealing properties and products and, in our case, we have a collection of franchises that are the most in demand,” he said.Electronic Arts, Activision’s closest rival, reported December quarter results below its expectations, significantly reduced its outlook and announced 1,100 jobs cuts – 11 per cent of its workforce. THQ also disappointed with its results and said it was cutting almost a quarter of its workforce.Software unit sales grew 15 per cent in the US last year, according to the NPD research firm, as the industry appeared to be a stand-out in bucking the recession. But Nintendo, helped by in-house titles for its best-selling Wii and DS consoles, and Activision Blizzard have been the chief beneficiaries.Mr Kotick said the company had no plans to make large cuts like its rivals. “We’re fortunate that all of the merger restructuring and right-sizing of the business is behind us,” he said.
216;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-02-05T00:07:20Z;Game sales benefit army of two;;To borrow an EA game title, it feels as if there is an Army of Two, or perhaps three, benefiting from booming video game software sales.That best sums up the paradox of strong industry sales but disappointing revenues and losses for individual publishers.Electronic Arts gave us its bad news on Tuesday, including 1,100 job losses as it cut its costs to match its reduced ambitions.On Wednesday, it was the turn of its smaller rival THQ, announcing savage cost-cutting after its holiday quarter disappointed.Like EA, THQ said it had produced high-quality games that had not found sufficient audiences as consumers focused on blockbuster titles.It reported a loss of 14 cents a share when analysts had expected a profit of 7 cents. Revenues were $357m compared to the $402m expected by Wall Street.THQ shares fell 15 per cent after-hours to $3.50, down from a 52-week high of $23.40 last April.The company, whose hits include Saints Row and SpongeBob Squarepants, is responding by reducing planned spending by $220m in its next fiscal year and cutting 600 jobs – almost a quarter of its workforce.The Army of Two then is Nintendo, which has dominated software sales on its leading Wii console, and Activision Blizzard, which cleaned up at Christmas with the latest in its Call of Duty series and Guitar Hero games. It will release December quarter results next Wednesday.Microsoft has also fared well with its homegrown titles for its Xbox console, such as Gears of War 2.NPD, GfK and Enterbrain reported this week that software unit sales in the US, UK and Japan grew by 15 per cent, 26 per cent and minus 13 per cent in 2008 for a combined total of 410m units and an average 11 per cent rise.Nintendo had three of the top five titles in Mario Kart, Wii Fit and Super Smash Bros: Brawl, with Take-Two’s Grand Theft Auto IV and Activision’s Call of Duty: World at War occupying the other two places.
217;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;EA cuts games business to the core;;"Electronic Arts chief executive John Riccitiello, a keen gamer, must have that stuck-on-the-same-level feeling after the video game publisher’s latest results.He returned to EA in April 2007 with the task of improving an underperforming giant of the industry.Instead, the company has continued to lose its lustre as a hit factory and has also lost its position as number one, due to the merger of Activision and Vivendi’s games division.The CEO has succeeded in improving the quality of existing franchises and has introduced innovative new titles.But EA lacked blockbuster hits in the holiday season and some of its games were shunned by retailers – consumers were confining their spending to top-ten hits and games for the Wii, where EA has been under-represented by its standards.This all added up to flat sales in the December quarter , reported on Tuesday, when the industry as a whole saw North American game sales rise 15 per cent. EA reported a $641m loss, which included a $368m writedown of its investment in its wireless business.EA has always had a reputation as a big spender that has pursued every platform for its games, but that is about to change.
Mr Riccitiello said he was cutting half a billion dollars from previous expectations for operating expenditure in the next financial year beginning in April, with the aim of reducing it to $2.1bn.That would be achieved with the help of a 14 per cent cut in versions of its games, the closure of 12 facilities and a cut of 11 per cent – or 1,100 people – in its workforce.The Sims 3, a much anticipated game due later this month has been pushed out to June and other significant titles, Godfather 2 and Dragon Age are also being delayed until the next fiscal year.EA will concentrate on core titles and redouble its efforts on the Wii platform, where games such as its Playground and Boogie were poorly received.The giant appears humbled – Mr Riccitiello said its marketing department would spend more time wooing consumers – but getting its costs under control is an important first step in any recovery, and moving on to that next level."
218;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-01-23T06:18:16Z;Planet Spore and PS3 Flower bloom;;Creating a planet and helping flowers to bloom are a far cry from the usual death and mayhem meted out by hard-core video gamers.But for those wanting to be creative rather than destructive and mellow rather than filled with adrenaline, the latest additions to the Spore franchise and the new Flower game for the PlayStation 3 can be recommended.The San Francisco gaming press have just been given first sight of the titles. Electronic Arts showed off Galactic Adventures on Wednesday evening, its first expansion pack for Spore, the evolution game released last September.Lucy Bradshaw, general manager of its creator, Maxis studios, said Spore had been the most successful launch of an original title in EA’s history and players had made 65m creations to date.Galactic Adventures, due in the spring, will allow them to shape entire planets and create adventures on them for others to play, using tools that Spore’s own game developers have used to create the original game. Spore Creature Keeper, due this summer, will allow younger players to nurture, train and play with their own customised creatures, while EA will release its first Wii version of the game in the autumn – Spore Hero.Jenova Chen is a former member of the Spore development team who left to co-found thatgamecompany, developer of Flower for the PS3, which will be available for download next month.Flower is simple enough for all ages and levels of experience to play it - using motion-sensing in the controller and pressing any button, players fly through the air guiding petals around a lush grassy landscape, touching flowers into bloom on their way and turning a sometimes monochromatic scene into blazing colour.There are several dream sequences that begin when potted plants in a dreary urban apartment are touched and, at the end of each one, the apartment and the world outside comes to life a little more.It is a very laid-back experience, the total opposite to being hunched forward on a first-person shooter game.“The game is about realising these urban flowers desires, they’re trying to escape from the burden and stress of city life, so the player gets to be this kind of consciousness, the god of nature for them.” says Mr Chen.It is all about stimulating a wider range of emotions and attracting a broader demographic of players, he adds.Let a thousand flowers bloom, as the saying goes.
219;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-01-09T20:06:02Z;Eidos shares tumble as Lara fails to excite;;Disappointing revenues from the latest Lara Croft games title could force Eidos to seek new financing before June.Shares in the games developer plunged 5¼p, more than 30 per cent, to 12p on Friday after it cut its sales guidance by £20m, due to dispiriting sales and heavy discounting, especially in North America.Tomb Raider: Underworld sold only 1.5m copies following its November launch. Eidos said nervous retailers in the US had restricted stock levels and offered deeper discounts than it had expected to lure shoppers into buying the latest video games.It now expects to make revenues of between £160m and £180m this year compared with previous guidance of £180m-£200m and said it may need to talk to its banks about covenant payments due in June.Nick Batram, analyst at KBC Peel Hunt, said a £20m drop in revenues would wipe out this year’s forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £10m. Eidos has gross margins of about 50 per cent.Other games developers, including Electronic Arts, the world’s second-largest games group, have also warned on sales and profits.Like EA, Eidos is increasingly dependent on hits, with its latest Batman game scheduled for release just before the end of its financial year in June.

221;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2009-01-06T22:52:58Z;US electronics showcase loses power;;"The annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is usually a crowded, glitzy event used by leading consumer electronics manufacturers to launch their latest gadgets and gizmos.However, the global recession has overshadowed preparations for this year’s event, which kicks off on Wednesday with a keynote address by Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive.While prospective attendees of the world’s largest consumer electronics show look forward to shorter taxi lines and less crowded restaurants, others are giving CES “a miss” for the first time.As a result, there has been a slew of stories about desperate Las Vegas hotels offering last-minute deals and show participants either cutting back on their floor presence, or pulling out altogether.While significant names such as Philips will be missing from CES, other industry giants, including Cisco, Sanyo, Panasonic and Belkin International, are sending fewer people, eliminating floor booths in favour of less expensive meeting rooms and off-site
hotel suites, and reworking their marketing messages to emphasise value for money.The Washington-based Consumer Electronics Association – the trade group that has staged the Las Vegas show for the past 42 years – says 300 companies including Blockbuster, Electronic Arts, Mattel and Verizon Wireless will have booths on the show floor for the first time, although exhibitors are sending fewer people to occupy them.The total number of exhibitors is expected to drop to 2,700 from 3,000 last year and the total floor space will shrink to 158,000 sq m from 167,000 sq m.The Consumer Electronics Association, the trade group that has staged the Las Vegas show for the past 42 years, says it is expecting about 130,000 attendees at the show, which ends Sunday, down from more than 141,000 last year and a peak of 152,000 two years ago.More than 25,000 attendees from overseas are expected.The drop-off in interest underscores the impact of the recession on the $173bn-a-year global consumer electronics industry, which had enjoyed uninterrupted sales growth for more than a decade.The CEA recently revised down its forecast for the industry’s US sales in the fourth quarter from 3.5 per cent growth to 0.1 per cent. Some analysts believe even this may prove over-optimistic.While US consumers will still have boosted their spending on consumer electronics devices by about 7 per cent last year, industry analysts and the CEA itself says they have become far more selective in recent months – for example, by buying smaller, less expensive flat panel TV sets and lower-cost NetBook computers instead of fully-featured laptops.“As much as 2008 was a stress test for the electronics industry, 2009 is likely to raise anxiety levels further,” Stephen Baker, vice-president of industry analysis for market researcher NPD Group, said in a recent research note.“Undoubtedly, the first half of 2009 will be miserable [for consumer electronics companies].”In response, retailers have slashed prices in an effort to maintain sales volumes and prevent inventory build-up, while manufacturers, including Sony, have already announced job cuts and plant closings.Last month, Sony said it would cut 8,000 of its 185,000 jobs, shut down plants and reduce its investment in electronics.Sir Howard Stringer, its chief executive, is due to give a keynote speech at CES on Thursday, as is Alan Mulally, chief executive of Ford, whose falling vehicle sales are hitting what had been a rapidly growing in-car entertainment segment for the industry.In an effort to mitigate the impact of corporate travel budget cuts, the CEA set aside $1m for the first time this year to help defray travel and hotel costs for thousands of retail buyers – the people who decide which products stores will sell in the coming year.Manufacturers are also shifting marketing resources to bolster retailers.For example, Belkin, which makes a wide range of PC, Mac and iPod peripherals, will not have a booth at CES for the first time in more than a decade.The company said that it would spend the money it saves on joint promotions with retailers.Other companies, such as Sanyo, have swapped expensive booths on the floor of CES for on-site meeting rooms that they will use to show dealers and retailers their new products.Similarly, Cisco cancelled plans for an exhibit on the show floor and will hold meetings at a nearby hotel.Additional reporting by Chris Nuttall in Las Vegas"
222;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-12-18T00:03:25Z;GTA maker is hit-and-run victim;;Video game software sales are up 30 per cent this year in the US, but the rising tide is not floating all boats – most publishers appear to be holed below the waterline.Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series, is the latest harbinger of bad news. For its first quarter, covering the peak sales months of November, December and January, it is forecasting a loss of 70 to 85 cents per share on revenues of $175m to $225m.That’s compared to the analyst consensus of a loss of 4 cents on sales of $311m, according to Reuters Estimates. That huge disparity sent Take-Two’s shares falling nearly 20 per cent in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $9.80.The price is a long way from the $25.74 takeover offer from Electronic Arts in the summer. EA abandoned talks over a deal in September.Ben Feder, Take-Two chief executive, said its guidance was “a prudent response to the difficult current and possible future business conditions. However, it seems more a reflection of its inability to produce any top-ten hits for the biggest sales season as a follow-up to the success of Grand Theft Auto IV earlier this year.The same lack of hits applies to THQ and Midway. THQ announced softness in sales last month and said it was cancelling titles and shedding 17 per cent of its workforce.Midway said on Tuesday it was getting rid of a quarter of its staff and suspending development of some non-core titles as economic conditions exacerbated its problems.EA had the eighth best-selling game in November with Left 4 Dead, but was otherwise hit-less. It issued a sales and profit warning last week and complained consumers were confining themselves to buying just the best-selling titles.They are Microsoft’s Gears of War 2, Nintendo’s Wii Fit, Wii Play and Mario Kart and the latest editions of Activision Blizzard’s Call of Duty, Guitar Hero and World of Warcraft franchises.Those three companies are the current hitmen of video games, the rest are just missing in action.
223;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-12-15T20:34:38Z;A match made in recession;;When Peter Huntsman and his family accepted a $6.5bn takeover offer last summer for the chemicals company they founded, they assumed the deal would have closed by now.Instead, Huntsman Corporation has spent months soothing investors and employees and convincing customers to stick around while battling buy-out firm Apollo in court over the deal, which finally collapsed late on Sunday.“Selling a business is not easy, and in today’s market it’s darn near impossible,” Mr Huntsman, chief executive of the company, says.As the year’s tally of broken mergers and dropped takeover bids grows, dozens of executives who spent months preaching the merits of a proposed deal are now scrambling to re-draft their strategies and explain why their companies will be just fine on their own.It is an uphill battle both for proposed acquirers and their jilted targets. One chief executive – Jeffrey Rein of the pharmacy chain Walgreens – recently stepped down after an attempted takeover of a rival fell through.The credit crunch, however, is giving most corporate leaders who might otherwise have lost credibility a chance to lay blame elsewhere. That may soften the blow to their reputations and egos. But it hardly lets them off the hook with shareholders, employees and customers.Executives at companies ranging from failed acquirers Microsoft, Electronic Arts and BHP Billiton, to abandoned targets Corn Products and Alpha Natural now face the challenge of having to rally their constituencies around a new plan of action.The difficulty of each company’s about-face depends on how important the deal was to their strategy, why it broke apart, and the strength of both companies’ next-best options.For an acquirer, the biggest peril of a broken deal may be having to argue – or pretend – that in spite of publicly lusting after a certain asset for months and claiming it is critical to your success, you do not actually need it. The plight of an abandoned target can be even tougher, however – particularly if customers have started switching away their business, or employees have headed for the exit.“When the deal falls apart, it’s usually the company that was going to be acquired that is hurt more,” says Robert Joffe, a partner at law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. “Usually, they end up looking around frantically for another deal.”Finding another suitor at an acceptable price is tough in this market, however, and a drawn-out search for an alternate acquirer could do more damage than good.“I don’t think you can be in a perpetual “for sale” mode,” said Mr Huntsman. “Who wants to work for a company or buy a company that doesn’t have a sure future?”Many former targets are instead hunkering down to shore up their businesses while, in some cases, trying to dodge low-ball bids from opportunistic rivals.After Microsoft dropped its unsolicited bid for Yahoo, for example, Yahoo tried to appease growth-minded investors by forming a partnership with Google before former chief Jerry Yang ultimately resigned.In some cases, even acquirers feel the need to review their defences. Cleveland-Cliffs, which some shareholders felt should have sold itself rather than trying unsuccessfully to buy coal miner Alpha Natural, adopted a “poison pill” anti-takeover device before the deal was cancelled.“Any time you get involved in a deal, you basically put yourself in play,” said Michael Quillen, chief executive of Alpha Natural. “You’ve told the world what you’re thinking about doing, and it is the acquired and acquirer that fall into that category.”A company’s vulnerability ultimately depends on its back-up options. Weak target companies that had been counting on a particular deal for salvation tend to be worst off, executives and their advisers say.Rescue deals to sell Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, Washingon Mutual, and parts of Lehman have grabbed headlines recently.But such situations would also include the broken acquisition of LandAmerica Financial by Fidelity National, which now-bankrupt LandAmerica had hoped would keep it from having to file for Chapter 11 protection.“If you’re selling a company out of weakness and something falls apart, and people knew you had to sell it, that’s a totally different scenario than if you’re selling it out of strength,” said Mr Huntsman.Huntsman’s biggest challenge, perhaps, was fighting claims by Apollo that Huntsman could become insolvent if its proposed merger was consummated. Solvency concerns also prompted the record-breaking takeover of Canadian telecommunications giant BCE to collapse.“We’re obviously in a very grey area here,” Mr Huntsman said. “How do you stop a rumour from spreading once that rumour is out?”“We’ve got some bridges to mend,” he said. “We’ve built this business from essentially nothing, and we’re fighters and are going to keep building the business.”Alpha Natural’s Mr Quillen said many of his shareholders had believed his company’s takeover was not likely to close in the first place, thanks to opposition by a key Cleveland-Cliffs investor, and have already “moved on”.He said: “Hopefully, we didn’t lose a lot of credibility as a management team. In our mind, we’ve never felt like we had a ‘for sale’ sign out on the front lawn.”Alpha, like other companies with a cushion of cash, is considering share buybacks, a dividend, or even an acquisition of its own as it retools its strategy. “But until this thing settles down, it’s really a difficult time to make the right decision,” Mr Quillen said. “It’s best being cautious for right now.”If anything, the past few months may have taught executives that caution is warranted not just after a deal falls apart but far earlier – when the transaction is announced.Microsoft, for example, highlighted its weaknesses when it professed that it needed Yahoo to compete on the web. Other companies that similarly evangelise about a certain asset, claiming that it will fill a gaping hole in their product or service portfolio, are often left with a heap of questions to answer if the deal disintegrates.United Technologies, on the other hand, began to stress with increased frequency as its unsuccessful courtship of Diebold dragged on that the deal was not a “must-have”.Such restrained messages are not likely to inspire acquisition fervour from shareholders, but they may prevent shareholder uprisings if a deal is scrapped.“It’s very important in designing your message to think about what you’re saying about your portfolio, in case the deal were to fall apart,” Cravath’s Mr Joffe says. “It’s hard to bridle the enthusiasm of businesspeople. They always want to paint things in the brightest of colours, but sometimes that’s self-defeating.”
224;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-12-11T22:39:39Z;Little Sony Big Nintendo Planet;;There are still 13 more shopping days until Christmas, but the video game winners and losers at US retail this season are already clear.Take a bow Nintendo, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. Start making your excuses now Sony and Electronic Arts.EA, which lost its position as the industry’s biggest third-party publisher this year with the merger of Activision Blizzard, did get in ahead of today’s NPD figures for November with a profit and sales warning earlier this week.Its inability lately to produce best-selling games has left it with retailers reluctant to restock some of its titles. Its only Top Ten title in the November figures is eighth-placed Left 4 Dead, the zombie game it is publishing on behalf of the independent developer Valve.Sony has buried the unimpressive figures for sales of its PlayStation 3 with the launch of its much-delayed Home virtual world today.The NPD numbers show the PS3 selling 378,000 units last month, almost double its October figure as holiday season sales ramped up. However, sales are down nearly 20 per cent on a year ago, when 466,000 were sold.In contrast, sales of the Wii have more than doubled year-on-year, from 981,000 to 2.04m, with supplies plentiful in contrast to 2007′s shortages. Xbox 360 sales rose from 770,000 to 836,000.In software, Microsoft’s Gears of War 2 was the number-one game, selling 1.56m copies – four times as many as Sony’s same-genre Resistance 2 in ninth place.Nintendo held four positions in the Top Ten with Wii Play, Wii Fit, Wii Music and Mario Kart. Activision Blizzard took the other three positions with two versions of Call of Duty: World at War and Guitar Hero World Tour. Its new World of Warcraft expansion pack for the PC – Wrath of the Lich King – sold more than 1.4m copies in the US.The figures bear out the continuing trend that the video game sector is alone in bucking the recession at retail. The big winners have been determined by consumer preference for cheaper consoles – the Xbox starting at $199 and the Wii at $250 – and an intensified focus by the buying public on the big hits.NPD says total sales were 10 per cent higher than last November, even with seven fewer days of post-Thanksgiving shopping. It says the industry is on course for $22bn in sales this year – a 22 per cent rise on 2007′s $18bn and a rare ray of sunlight for retail overall.
225;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-12-10T22:00:23Z;Commodities lead Wall St rally;;"Credit card stocks were notable exceptions to a commodities-led rally on Wall Street on Wednesday amid mounting concerns of heavy losses from risky loans.“The powerful combination of rising unemployment and weak housing should drive charge-offs above historical peak levels,” warned Citigroup, which initiated coverage of the sector with a bearish view.American Express was the worst hit, down 7.4 per cent to $21.56 after Donald Fandetti, Citi analyst, said aggressive growth during the credit boom left it even more exposed than peers.He added that, although the company “now has access to funding following bank holding company status, they may need to seek longer-term funding solutions”. He placed a “sell” rating on the stock.Other financials escaped the wider market gains. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley fell 2.8 per cent to $8.30 and 2.5 per cent to $14.60 ahead of results season.However, the wider market finished higher despite profit warnings and analyst downgrades across a wide range of other sectors, as well as fears political wrangling could delay a bail-out of the car industry.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 1.2 per cent at 899.24 after swings between positive and negative territory throughout the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 8,761.42 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2 per cent to 1,565.48.“The good news is that investors are finally getting used to bad news,” said Andrew Wilkinson, market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “In turn, that makes it possible for counter-intuitive rallies, especially in equity markets.”The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 5.4 per cent to its lowest level in nearly two weeks. Still, at 55.73, it continued to indicate signs of severe distress.Consumer discretionary stocks performed well despite a profit warning from Eastman Kodak, which had already cut its forecasts in October. Shares in the photography group lost 8.5 per cent to $6.59.Similarly, the technology sector held up even after Electronic Arts– off 12.1 per cent to $17 – cut its outlook, which prompted a host of analyst downgrades for the video games stock.Yahoo climbed 9.9 per cent to $13.40 after Ivory Investment Management, a shareholder, urged a tie-up with Microsoft, which edged 0.1 per cent higher at $20.61.Apple was an exception to the gains, off 1.9 per cent to $98.21, after Morgan Stanley cut its price target from $105 and $95.“We view [the] iPhone as most price-sensitive in a global recession and do not believe the combination of double-digit unit growth and [at least] 40 per cent gross margins are sustainable.”The energy sector, up 4.7 per cent, led the market’s advance as oil prices rebounded.Material stocks also performed well, up 2.7 per cent overall, as base metals staged a recovery. Mining stocks were in sharp focus after Rio Tinto’s restructuring to cut costs, and Alcoa and Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold gained 6.8 per cent to $10.20 and 16 per cent to $22.89, respectively.The telecoms sector was off 2.6 per cent overall amid concerns over the future of Nortel.Shares in the battered Canadian equipment maker shed a further 23.1 per cent to $0.40, although the group said it had no imminent plans for a bankruptcy
filing.AT&T lost 3.7 per cent to $28.08 even after FBR resumed coverage of the stock with an “outperform” rating. FBR said it was “insulated from macro pressures due to its diversified revenue mix”.Also weighing on sentiment, data from the Commerce Department showed wholesale inventories fell by 1.1 per cent in October, the most in seven years and worse than expected.Meanwhile, shares in General Motors and Fordenjoyed strong gains early in the session as negotiations between the Bush administration and Capitol Hill over a bail-out for the ailing car industry initially appeared to edge closer to a conclusion.However, the shares fell back to finish 2.1 per cent lower at $4.60 and 0.6 per cent higher at $3.25 after Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, called the planned bail-out “a travesty”."
226;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;EA braced for drop in profits as sales slump;;"Electronic Arts, the second largest video game publisher, issued a sales and profits warning on Tuesday as it reported lower than expected demand for its titles during the holiday season across North America and Europe.EA, based in Silicon Valley, said it would take additional cost-cutting measures including headcount reductions and consolidation of its facilities.It had already announced a 6 per cent cut in its workforce in October, when it said it would eliminate some titles.The video game industry as a whole has been bucking the recession with US
game sales in October up 35 per cent on the previous year.But EA has lacked blockbuster hits to take advantage of the boom and says it is now suffering because retailers are not restocking lesser “catalogue” titles.“Today consumers are particularly selective in how they spend their discretionary dollars,” John Riccitiello, chief executive, told an analyst conference call Tuesday.“We are seeing a stronger polarisation around the top-10 selling titles and key catalogue titles continuing to underperform.”He said large retailers were reducing inventories towards the year-end and focusing on the top five titles.In October, EA reduced its sales and profit expectations for the fiscal year to between $5bn and $5.3bn and $1 to $1.40 per share respectively. It said Tuesday it expected revenues and profits would be significantly lower than those expectations.EA has failed to make a significant impression on the most successful console platform – Nintendo’s Wii.Mr Riccitiello said all publishers faced the problem that Nintendo itself was dominating, with two-thirds of titles sold for its console being made by itself.Mr Riccitiello said his focus on improving the quality of EA games was paying off, with higher scores from reviewers.But he appears to have misjudged gamers’ appetites with consumers buying a limited number of titles.The chief executive said EA would adjust its strategy by releasing fewer titles and spending more on marketing those that had the greatest hit potential.EA shares closed 11.5 per cent lower in New York at $19.35 and were another 10 per cent lower in after-hours trading at $17.35, following the warning.Analysts at Lazard Capital Markets had reduced their estimates for EA on Monday citing product and execution challenges.They cited lower than expected sales of Rock Band 2, Mirror’s Edge and Need for Speed Undercover, with the latter receiving disappointing reviews."
227;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Women targeted in new Wii workouts;;Console game publishers are working up a sweat in their efforts to win over a casual gaming audience.Peter Moore, once a PE teacher but now head of EA Sports, says he has given himself some tough workouts testing its new Active personalised fitness product for the Nintendo Wii, but sees women as the natural target audience.Women, consistently in the minority as game players, have been drawn to the Wii and the activities made possible by its motion-sensing controller. EA announced today it will launch Active next March, leveraging the popularity of Nintendo’s Wii Fit and its balance board accessory, which resembles a bathroom scale.EA is adding other peripherals including a resistance band and leg straps containing the controllers – enabling monitoring of fitness levels within a personalised workout programme.“This will complement the Wii’s balance board, which is more about the Eastern philosophy of fitness with balance and coordination. In the West, we’re all about getting a sweat on and getting your heart rate up,” says Mr Moore.EA Sports core audience up to now has been predominantly young male players, who have bought millions of copies of Madden NFL and other sports titles.“We’re in no way blind to the challenges that talking to a mid-30s woman presents for EA Sports, but we think health and wellness and fitness over the next few years is going to be very important to consumers.”Other publishers are also targeting fitness and the female demographic on the Wii. THQ has just launched its All Star Cheer Squad, teaching cheerleading and dance moves using the balance board. Another publisher has announced plans for a pole dancing game.However, Celia Pearce, co-founder of the Ludica women’s game collective, says publishers fall into the trap of seeing women as stereotypes.“The problem is that when you get a bunch of golf-playing guys in a room brainstorming about women’s games, you get some pretty stupid ideas,” she says.“When I hear pole dancing and cheerleading, I just cringe, because I feel they do not get it still. I wish these companies would hire more women – there are many freelance women game designers, mostly because they can’t stand to work in the macho environments of game companies.”
228;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-11-05T22:26:41Z;A quantum of consolidation in video games;;Video game publishers are often criticised for a lack of imagination in concentrating on blockbuster sequels, but it seems that’s about all gamers are prepared to pay for in these recessionary times.Electronic Arts cut jobs and its forecasts last week as it reported that consumers were concentrating on its frontline titles and neglecting middle-tier ones and older catalogue games.Today, THQ announced a major restructuring, with cancelled titles, five studio closures and 250 job losses – about 17 per cent of its workforce. It said it was now focused on producing a core number of high quality games.Brian Farrell, chief executive, reported softness in sales of catalogue titles and a cautious retail environment. The kids licence business – THQ makes titles based on Nickelodeon cartoons and Disney Pixar movies – had slowed considerably and become less profitable, he said.Activision Blizzard, now the biggest player in the sector since the merger with Vivendi’s games division, seems in the best position.It has its biggest ever slate of AAA titles for the holiday season, it said today, including World of Warcraft’s Wrath of the Lich King, two Guitar Hero titles, Call of Duty: World at War and a title based on the James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace.Even so, there was a quantum of reserve in the remarks of chief executive, Bobby Kotick.“We remain cautious given the likely slowdown in consumer spending this holiday season,” he said, adding “This is the most uncertainty that we have ever experienced.”
229;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-10-31T20:44:12Z;US stocks bouyant despite grim economic data;;US stocks extended their dramatic weekly gains on Friday as investors once again overlooked a fresh glut of grim economic data and hunted for bargains.The market finished in positive territory even though downbeat consumer data and a key measure of business activity illustrated the toll that the financial crisis had taken on the economy.A lacklustre morning session gave way to a sharp afternoon rally, which eased into the close. The S&P 500 closed up 1.5 per cent at 968.75, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.6 per cent at 9,324.69 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.3 per cent at 1,720.95.JPMorgan, up 9.7 per cent at $41.25, was the biggest winner on the Dow after the bank said it would modify terms on mortgages and delay foreclosures. The financial sector led the market gains, up 5.5 per cent.In spite of official confirmation that the US economy had shrunk, the market enjoyed its strongest week for more than three decades.For the week, Friday’s rally left the S&P up 10.5 per cent, the Nasdaq up 10.9 per cent and the Dow up 11.3 per cent. Illustrating the market’s wild volatility, the recovery was still not enough to stop the worst monthly sell-off since 1987.Further developments on Friday served as a reminder of the difficulties facing company earnings.Carnival tumbled 11.5 per cent to $25.40 after the cruise liner group suspended its post-December dividend, while Electronic Arts dropped 17.9 per cent to $22.78 after the video game publisher issued a profit warning.Meanwhile, Chevron edged up 0.6 per cent to $74.60 after spending much of the session in negative territory, even though the oil group disclosed that third-quarter profit had doubled on the back of soaring crude prices earlier in the summer.ExxonMobil, which struggled to find positive territory in the previous session despite unveiling a world-record corporate profit, slid another 1.2 per cent to $74.12. Traders were concerned about the prospects for energy groups as the oil price continued to slide.For the week, Tuesday overwhelmed all other sessions with a stunning 10.8 per cent advance after widespread selling of yen positions left traders with cash to invest in US stocks.The Federal Reserve’s move to cut interest rates and the easing of strain in money markets also gave stocks a boost.In financials, regional banks ended the week 16.3 per cent higher after a host of them accepted government cash under its banking recapitalisation scheme.Airlines soared, up 7.4 per cent for the week. Boeing climbed 15.9 per cent during the week to $52.42 amid hopes that a machinists’ strike would be called off this weekend.Meanwhile, General Motors swung wildly and was on track to end the week down 2.7 per cent.Although Moody’s downgraded its rating on the motor group, investors were heartened by reports that the government was considering providing financial assistance in a possible merger with Chrysler and that the group had resolved “major issues” with the potential partner’s owner, Cerberus Capital Management.The latest chapter in the saga came on Friday when Reuters reported that the Bush administration had ruled out funding for a possible deal, and the stock fell 4.6 per cent to $5.79.Procter & Gamble gained 9.6 per cent for the week to $64.54, even though the consumer products group lowered the bottom end of its full-year earnings guidance.Motorola added 7.2 per cent to $5.37 in spite of the group posting an unexpected third-quarter loss and saying that the mobile device business spin-off would be delayed.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shed 25.2 per cent over the week, although at 59.75 it continued to indicate signs of severe distress.
230;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-10-29T23:11:09Z;Beatles come together with Rock Band;;Beatles music will be used in the popular Rock Band video game, marking the first big digital foray by the Fab Four, according to people familiar with the plans.Viacom’s MTV Networks, which owns the game, and Apple Corps, the company established by the Beatles to oversee their business interests, were expected to reveal the deal as part of a broader “global music project”.The parties planned to announce the project on Thursday, according to an invitation sent by e-mail. Among those scheduled to attend were Apple Corps chief Jeff Jones, MTV Networks chairman Judy McGrath and MTV Networks president Van Toffler.Financial terms of the deal were not immediately available. A deal would also require the approval of EMI Music, which owns the master recordings, and Sony/ATV, which owns the copyrights.The Financial Times reported in June that Beatles representative were in discussions with two companies – Activision, which publishes Guitar Hero, and MTV Games, which owns the Rock Band franchise - to create a Beatles-themed video game.Surviving members of the band have been cautious in licensing their works and have rarely made their songs available digitally, but have dabbled in offering streams of an album on Beatles.com and have run trailers on YouTube. The Beatles have not made their songs available on Apple’s popular iTunes digital entertaiment storefront.Apple Corps has become more active in recent months since Jeff Jones took over as chief executive. The company, whose board includes Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Olivia Harrison and Yoko Ono Lennon, has allowed Beatles compositions to be used on the American Idol television series and in a Las Vegas show.Representatives of MTV Networks and EMI declined to comment. A representative of Apple Corps could not be reached for comment.For MTV Networks, which acquired video game developer Harmonix in 2006, Rock Band has turned into a surprise hit. It has sold 3.5m copies by the end of the second quarter this year. The game is distributed by publisher Electronic Arts.Signing up Apple Corps is the latest salvo against rival Activision Blizzard, whose Guitar Hero was also developed by Harmonix before MTV’s purchase.Taking a victory lap after closing a deal to merge Activision with Vivendi’s Blizzard Entertainment at the annual media and technology mogul get-together this summer, Activision Blizzard’s chief executive, Robert Kotick, told reporters the company was considering developing a digital storefront for music through its video game franchise.
231;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-10-24T20:34:16Z;Sports industry begins to feel crunch;;The financial crisis is hitting some of the mightiest sports institutions and challenging the skills of sports administrators as they try to rep­lace corporate sponsors tightening their purse strings.Manchester United is looking for a new shirt sponsor following the near-collapse and bail-out of AIG, the world’s largest insurer. The Premier League and Champions League title holders are said to have been told by the humbled AIG it is in no position to renew its £14m-a-year deal, which is halfway through its four-year term.In normal circumstances, United could expect a queue of sponsors ready to take AIG’s place. But few people in the sports industry are sounding confident about the fate of their leagues and clubs during the downturn.“Even Manchester United will not find it easy,” a sports administrator said on the fringes of a global sports business summit in London on Friday. “There are not many sponsors out there.”The Association of Tennis Professionals, the body that runs the ATP men’s tour, is struggling to replace Mercedes as its title sponsor by the end of this year. Talks with a car company and a financial services group have faded. The ATP is at least relieved that the findings of a report it commissioned into its 60-odd tournaments found that most deals with sponsors were intact.Sports such as tennis, golf and Formula One that have appealed to banks and financial services will need to look for backers from other sectors but, says Peter Moore, president of EA Sports, the US sports gaming company, the sponsorship market is shrinking rapidly.“We are seeing more and more [sponsorship] opportunities, and more things come our way,” he said.Sponsorship is not the sports industry’s sole worry. US sports teams, particularly in American football, are developing stadiums to boost revenues but face the prospect of financing drying up. New York’s two NFL franchises, the Jets and the Giants, have begun work on their joint 82,000-seater stadium, costing £1.3bn ($2bn) and due to open in 2010. Dallas Cowboys should complete their new stadium development next year.These are expected to be unaffected by the credit freeze but Roger Goodell, NFL commissioner, acknowledges that the economic climate “will have an impact” on capital investment.Meanwhile, team owners face a showdown with players over pay. “We do want to get the salary costs down,” Mr Goodell says. “We are not saying salaries have to come down but they may not grow at the same rate.”Across the sporting landscape, administrators are checking balance sheets anxiously. Nascar, the top US motorsport, has reported falling sponsorship levels, a problem also forcing F1 to consider standardised engines and gearboxes to help teams cope with £150m a year costs.Sports with more reason for optimism are those that can rely on the dependable income streams of season ticket and long television rights deals. Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, said having both of these put it in a “very fortunate position” in the short term.What no sport can guarantee is the readiness of fans to turn up in stricken times. But Mr Goodell is not the only administrator to pin his hopes on the quality of the product and faith in the fan.“As the economy is in a tailspin, it is clearly going to impact on us but there is a flight to quality,” he says. “People are trying to get away and be entertained.”
232;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-10-08T00:40:01Z;Enjoyed that dog howling to “My Way”? Then buy the song;;On Thursday it will be two years since Google shelled out $1.65bn for YouTube, and sometimes it feels like all it’s had in return are escalating legal bills and bandwidth costs that would have bankrupted any other company.So it was sobering today to talk to Shishir Mehrotra, the former Microsoft executive whose job it is to find ways to make money out of YouTube, and hear him say that the video site is “early in the experimentation process.”Early? It is more than a year since YouTube announced the launch of “in-video advertising,” overlay panes placed over the bottom 20 per cent of some videos. That hasn’t done much: along with other gimmicks, like the video ad placed on its home page and contests it runs on behalf of advertisers, YouTube is still only expected to pull in around $200m this year, according to the Wall Street Journal.Today comes the latest idea: adding “buy it now” buttons to the site so that viewers who feel particularly moved by a video can go straight to Amazon or iTunes and buy a related song, movie or book.This idea certainly makes sense, though it runs up against the big issue that currently bedevils all the money-making ideas on YouTube: if Google tries to profit from any video clips that infringe copyright, it loses the protections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and risks a lawsuit. The first ecommerce links will appear only on “official” content posted on YouTube by EMI, Universal Music and Electronic Arts (for its Spore video game.)Putting a “buy it now” link on user-generated videos – like that Frank Sinatra song howled by a musical dog – is trickier. Google’s “content identification and management system” is meant to pick out potentially infringing videos like this and give copyright owners a choice: have the video blocked, leave it be but track audience response, or try to make money from it through advertising (or, now, ecommerce.)There is at least one positive sign. According to Mehrotra, copyright owners of more than 90 per cent of the material identified through its filtering system have picked the third option. Yet most of the big entertainment companies are still wary of Google and its filter and haven’t yet released their material to be used this way.Thank goodness Google has the cash – and the patience – to keep experimenting.UPDATE: Google today launched another experiment in expanding its ad revenues with AdSense for Games, writes Chris Nuttall. Google is inserting video ads during pauses in Flash-based games. Engineers from Adscape, the in-game advertising company bought by Google last year, helped to implement the technology. Google will share revenues with game developers and publishers. It says 200m people play online games every week.
233;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Trion scores $70m as games hit VC jackpot;;VC money ought to be hard to come by in these credit-crunched times, but games industry start-ups still seem to be scoring big.Trion World Network announced $70m in third-round funding on Tuesday, after Big Fish Games landed an $83m round earlier this month.Trion has ambitious plans to create a new kind of online gaming platform. The Silicon Valley company has now raised more than $100m since it was co-founded by Lars Buttler in the shadow of the headquarters of Electronic Arts, his former company, in 2006.The chief executive told me the funds would be channelled into building a portfolio of server-based games now that Trion’s platform infrastructure was in place.“We are going to work more and more with independent developers, who have a huge interest in building the next-generation server-based games but have no capabilities for building a huge powerful server architecture for them,” he said.Trion’s investors included Act II Capital and previous investors Time Warner and NBC Universal’s VC arm.Seattle-based Big Fish Games is another online player, but is focused more on downloads and single-player gaming than the massively multiplayer genre to which Trion aspires.Its investors were General Catalyst Partners, Salmon River Capital and London-based Balderton Capital.
234;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-09-20T02:14:34Z;Spore protesters get fives from EA;;While Spore, the evolution game from Electronic Arts, gives players the freedom of the galaxy, it has been accused of imprisoning them with restrictive digital rights management when they install it.A protest campaign on Amazon.com, where more than 2,500 reviewers have given Spore one star out of five, appears to have borne fruit.Frank Gibeau, the head of the EA Games label, has issued a statement saying EA is amending its DRM policy to allow installation on five machines instead of three and allowing further activations of the game where warranted.The company would also expedite development of a system that would allow consumers to de-authorise machines and move authorisations to new machines.“We’ve received complaints from a lot of customers who we recognise and respect,” he said.“And while it’s easy to discount the noise from those who only want to post or transfer thousands of copies of the game on the Internet, I believe we need to adapt our policy to accommodate our legitimate consumers.”While EA has a difficult balance to strike with DRM – between discouraging illegal copying and not making life difficult for users – it appears to have blundered here on its most anticipated release of the year. The effect on sales since its September 5 launch will not be known until the NPD figures are released next month, but it has taken nearly two weeks to come up with this response.EA has also addressed another complaint about Spore that families could only use the screen name of the installer of the game.A moderator on EA’s Spore forum has announced that each online account established on registration of the game can now have up to five screen names attached to it.So Spore fans can now go forth and multiply, although not quite in the same numbers as the millions of creatures they have created so far to populate the game.
235;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-09-15T18:41:52Z;Car theft gamemaker falls as EA ends pursuit;;Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto video game series, lost almost a quarter of its value on Monday after rival Electronic Arts ended its seven-month pursuit of the company.EA said on Sunday it had abandoned talks over a deal and would not continue with its bid.Take-Two shares fell 24 per cent in New York to $16.57.Analysts lowered their target prices for Take-Two and suggested it had made a strategic error in the talks.Standard & Poor’s analysts, referring to the performance of the Grand Theft Auto IV game, said: “We believe negotiations became more difficult after Take-Two was unwilling to budge on its position after it exceeded expectations in its most recent quarterly results.“We think that Electronic Arts will be hurt by not having Take-Two’s Grand Theft Auto nor being the market leader in the video game industry following the merger of Activision and Vivendi Games to form Activision Blizzard.”Citigroup analysts said that, while a deal was dead for now, they believed EA would return at a later date. Take-Two was a good strategic fit, with sports franchises needed by EA and was being run by a turnround team who saw an acquisition as an exit strategy, they said.In an interview with the Financial Times, Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two chairman, said it was EA who had refused to budge in not raising its offer.He said: “They approached us and they stayed at a price and they never budged, in fact they reduced it. That’s not typically the way deals get done”.He said EA continued to be in discussions with other parties regarding its process to consider strategic alternatives, but said he was not in a position to name possible suitors.EA, the publisher of titles such as the Madden NFL football game and The Sims, had been fighting to acquire Take-Two since February, when it offered to pay up to $26 per share, or about $2bn.The companies started formal talks over a deal last month, after EA allowed to expire an unsolicited tender offer it had made to buy Take-Two at the slightly lower price of $25.74.The Federal Trade Commission ruled in August that it would not oppose a deal between the two companies, a move some analysts had felt was the main obstacle to a takeover.EA said on Sunday that after reviewing Take-Two’s financial materials and hearing presentations from management, it had “decided not to make a proposal to acquire Take-Two and has terminated discussions”.
236;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-09-14T22:54:04Z;Electronic Arts ends campaign to buy Take-Two;;Electronic Arts said on Sunday that it had abandoned talks over a deal to buy rival video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software and would not press forward with a bid, presumably ending its seven-month battle to acquire the company.EA, the publisher of the Madden American football game and Rock Band, has been fighting to acquire Take-Two since February, when its offered to pay up to $26 per share, or about $2bn (£1.1bn).The video game rivals started formal talks over a deal under a month ago, after EA agreed to let an unsolicited tender offer it had made to buy Take-Two at a slightly lower price expire.The Federal Trade Commission ruled in August that it would not oppose a deal between the two companies, a move some analysts had felt was the main obstacle to a takeover.EA said on Sunday, however, that after reviewing Take-Two’s financial materials and hearing presentations from management, it had “decided not to make a proposal to acquire Take-Two and has terminated discussions”.Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two’s chairman, said in response that his company was still “actively engaged in discussions with other parties in the context of our formal process to consider strategic alternatives”. He said Take-Two’s business had strengthened since EA first made its unsolicited offer.Throughout the saga between the two companies, investors have tried to calculate whether EA would be willing to pay more than $26 per share – or whether a deal would close at all.Shares of Take-Two have traded below $26 since late June and had dropped below $22 in recent trading sessions. Shares in the publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series closed at $21.89 on Friday.The company has had a volatile 18 months. Shareholders ejected top management in early 2007 over lacklustre results and questions over graphic content in the company’s games. Several of its former senior executives were caught up in an accounting scandal.Its third-quarter results came in stronger than expected on heavy sales of Grand Theft Auto 4 but the company cut its outlook to reflect the delayed release of another game.Vivendi, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with Activision Blizzard, which was formed in July when Vivendi closed on a deal to meld Activision, Electronic Arts’ major competitor, into its own gaming business. Activision, which publishes the popular Guitar Hero video game franchise, announced last week that it would buy UK game developer FreeStyleGames.
237;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Spore hit by DRM protest;;Spore, the much anticipated evolution game from Electronic Arts, has won high marks from the gaming press but has currently earned only one star out of five from amateur reviewers on Amazon.com.The reason – unusually restrictive digital rights management software that limits installations of the game.Spore, released in North America on Sunday, only allows three activations of the game before players have to call EA for permissions to install it again, according to the Amazon protesters.As someone who has so far installed the game three times – twice on computers that failed to run it – I can understand their concerns.According to one of the 864 reviewers on Amazon:“The DRM for the game utilizes securom which is essentially a virus that installs itself without warning when you install the game. There is no way to completely remove it without reformatting and it is constantly running in the background if not removed. Sucking up computer resources.”Another complains:“DRM is a show stopper. I doubt this game will work for me after a few years given my habit of new hardware purchases and system snapshots. Like others have said, this game is for rent not sale. The EA Spore DRM is a bit reminiscent of the Sony root kit. It installs software that you definitely don’t want or need.”Spore has a rating of 87 out of 100 on Metacritic.com based on 25 media reviews but currently has 796 one-star reviews on Amazon.I have asked Electronic Arts to comment on the claims and will update this post with its reaction when received.UPDATE: Jeff Brown, vice president of corporate communications at EA, told me on Tuesday that in its last financial year only 0.5 per cent of players activated EA computer games on as many as three machines, with 90 per cent activating on only one machine. He said EA Customer Service would talk through any special circumstances with customers calling to request further activations. He described EA’s SecuROM DRM as standard for the industry and cited Apple’s practice of only allowing downloaded music to be played on three devices. “We are extremely pleased with the popularity of Spore and the critical response to it,” he said. The latest figures on Amazon are 1,676 one-star reviews out of 1,812.
238;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-09-07T18:12:09Z;Electronic Arts banks on evolutionary process;;It is green, has two legs, four arms, two mouths, an eye in the back of its head and, says Frank Drake, who founded the US’s Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence in 1961, it is the perfect creature for earth.“I call it Supersapiens,” Mr Drake, 78, told the new California Academy of Sciences last week as he presented an animation of the creature dancing and singing with its children.It is one of 3m new “species” brought to life and uploaded on to the internet since June by users of Creature Creator, video game software from Electronic Arts.Creator was the precursor of a larger game called Spore, launched on Sunday in the US after a five-year gestation.Spore presents a unique challenge in how to market it and the unprecedented creative powers it bestows on gamers.The game takes players from creating single-cell creatures through the different stages of evolution, the formation of tribes, the building of cities and the colonisation of space.Its breadth has meant the development of a number of Creator tools for animating creatures and designing buildings and vehicles. Users can upload creations to Sporepedia, an online database, for others to use in their versions.Will Wright, Spore’s creator, says the tools build on what was possible in his previous game, The Sims, and enable users to create in seconds what a Pixar animator would take hours to do.Already an almost exact copy of WALL.E, the subject of the studio’s latest film, has appeared in Sporepedia.This raises copyright questions, in particular because Spore allows films to be easily produced from the game and uploaded to YouTube.Mr Wright says media companies’ attitudes to such user-generated content have matured.“People who own intellectual property are starting to reorient themselves because kids are growing up in a digital remix culture,” he said at the Academy of Sciences launch party for the game.“George Lucas used to go after Star Wars fan sites but realised he was killing the community and so he started encouraging this.”Parents may be concerned that the child-rated game could be used to create unsuitable animations, similar to the flying genitalia that have invaded the virtual world Second Life on occasions. EA says there are parental controls and the Spore community has been very good at policing itself.Video game publishers normally release “demos” ahead of new games, restricted to one or two difficulty levels, in order to create buzz, but Creature Creator represented something of a departure.Patrick Buechner, head of marketing for Spore, said: “Being in control of an entire universe can seem like a very daunting task. We had to communicate how approachable Spore was and the primary tool for that was the Creature Creator.”The free program was downloaded 3.5m times, leading to 3m uploads to Sporepedia and about 110,000 videos of creatures appearing on YouTube.Will Wright said the tool was meant “to hook people in creatively and very personally” to the deeper subject of science – a stretch for some players used to video game shoot ’em ups or the urban lifestyles of The Sims.EA has established Spore’s scientific credentials with a link up with Seti and a documentary on the National Geographic Channel in which Will Wright will explore a lifelong passion and talk to scientists about Spore and its uses in teaching evolutionary biology.“This helps build that credibility that Spore is based in real science and that there is something to be learned while you’re playing,” said Mr Buechner.Loss-making EA would love to see its patience in Spore rewarded with a blockbuster hit but analysts doubt it can match The Sims, which reached sales of 100m units this year.Edward Woo, video game analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities, said: “So far the [reviewer] ratings are pretty good though not spectacular.“We think the game will sell well – 3m in the current quarter, and another 2m by March 2009 – but we do not think it will have the performance of The Sims, of about 10m units a year in sales.”
239;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-09-05T15:03:22Z;What will Wright spawn next?;;Electronic Arts finally got its Spore video game out of the door last night with a spectacular launch event at the new California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park.Prior to a guided tour of the galaxies in the planetarium, Frank Drake, who formulated the Drake Equation on extraterrestrial life in 1960, gave a talk and Will Wright, Spore’s creator, made a presentation in his own inimitable style.Wright, who justifies the genius tag, made it seem that his whole life had been a preparation for Spore. He described how he spent all his time building models as a kid growing up in the 60s. He was inspired by the race to the moon and the future predictions of that era – from nuclear-powered cars to space colonies.He has been building robots since the 80s and has had a lifelong interest in astronomy.All of this fits with the Spore experience where players create and evolve their own lifeforms and go on to populate planets and conquer space.Wright began the research on this much anticipated game seven years ago, so its own evolution has been lengthy. It also makes you wonder where Wright has left to boldly go.From SimCity and SimEarth in the 80s and 90s to the 100m-selling Sims in this decade, and now Spore, Wright has pretty much covered life as we know it and beyond.But when I questioned him afterwards about whether he could take on the subject again on such a grand scale, he said:”You’d be surprised.”“I’ve had some ideas I’ve been working on in the background. There are plenty of different ways of seeing the world. The Sims and Spore are both about life on different scales, but they are essentially about what life means.”So another variation on his theme is apparently in the works, but probably on a Spore delivery timescale:“It might take a while,” was his parting shot.
240;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-09-02T17:03:30Z;Japan forced into new game plan;;Nintendo’s video game hardware may have taken the world by storm, but Japan’s video game software companies are suffering a crisis of confidence.Squeezed between the rising cost of making a cutting-edge game and a divergence in the tastes of Japanese and western gamers, Japan’s game companies are being forced to consider mergers to remain competitive.Announcing a $200m takeover offer for smaller rival Tecmo last week, Square Enix, one of the leading companies, said: “The Japanese games industry is standing at a crossroads, and whether it will stay at the centre of the global games industry, or whether it will lose that position, is now unclear.”Such feelings are widespread in an industry where Sega, Konami and Capcom have led the world since the original Nintendo Entertainment System console launched in the US and Europe in 1985.At the E3 trade show in Los Angeles in July, only one Japanese game won a Best of E3 award, and that was in a minor category. For a country that has won the Best Console Game category in five of the last 10 years it is like the Hollywood studios winning nothing but the Oscar for Best Costume Design at the Academy Awards.Part of the problem is a change in consumer tastes: what sells in Tokyo is no longer sure to sell in Berlin or New York. Western consumers like driving and shooting games, for example, and enjoy very few of the lavish role-playing titles produced in Japan.Capcom’s strategy is to make games with international appeal, but some of its big hits abroad, such as zombies-in-a-mall title Dead Rising, have not sold at home. “The black humour in Dead Rising was not popular in Japan,” said Capcom producer Keiji Inafune at an event in Tokyo this week.Such a divergence in tastes would matter less if broad international appeal was not essential to the economics of modern video games.Games for the most powerful consoles, such as Sony’s Playstation 3 and Microsoft’s Xbox 360, are now played within simulated 3D worlds, and making such worlds realistic requires an army of artists, animators and physics programmers. As a result, it can cost as much as $20m to develop a big title – which is hard to recover from sales in a single market.The rising cost of production also increases the risks. A small game company might be able to afford one failure, but will struggle to survive if two projects flop.In the US, games companies have responded by merging, in order to spread their bets across a number of titles. France’s Vivendi has merged its Blizzard games division with Activision of the US, while Electronic Arts is in talks about a $2bn takeover of rival Take Two, which publishes the hit Grand Theft Auto series. Electronic Arts has a market capitalisation of $15.6bn.In Japan, where there has been less takeover activity, the companies are smaller. Square Enix has a market capitalisation of Y411.2bn ($3.8bn), Capcom is valued at Y231.8bn, and Konami, which has a range of businesses beyond video gaming, at Y454.9bn.Many analysts therefore think that small companies such as Tecmo need to merge and support Square Enix’s efforts at consolidation.“This will help them to diversify,” said Carlos Dimas, an analyst at HSBC Securities in Tokyo.It is not all doom and gloom, however, because the depth of videogaming culture, talent and brands in Japan is widely respected. The decline Japanese game makers fear is relative – and many of their US and European rivals would love to have their problems.
241;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-08-29T17:10:18Z;Square Enix in friendly offer for Temco;;"Tecmo, a Japanese video games developer known for gratuitous gore and highly-sexualised female characters, has received a takeover bid from a larger rival as consolidation accelerates in the industry.Square Enix said on Friday it would make a friendly offer for at least 50 per cent of the company provided that Tecmo’s board accepted its offer by September 4. Tecmo replied that it was considering its response to the offer, which values its equity at Y21.7bn ($200m).If successful, the deal would unite Tecmo’s Dead or Alive fighting titles and Ninja Gaiden action adventures, with Square Enix’s Final Fantasy series of role-playing games. Tecmo’s franchises are popular in the US and Europe – an important attraction for Square Enix as it seeks to produce titles that will have broad appeal worldwide.The deal is the latest merger between companies struggling with the high cost of creating games for next-generation consoles such as Sony’s Playstation 3 and Microsoft’s Xbox 360.France’s Vivendi recently merged its games business with Activision Blizzard of the US, while Electronic Arts is in talks to buy US rival Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series, for about $2bn.Square Enix has struck at a difficult time for Tecmo. Tomonobu Itagaki – the company’s star developer, whose long hair, leather jacket and sunglasses are not the usual attire of a Japanese salaryman – quit Tecmo at the start of June. He then sued his former employer for alleged non­payment of a completion bonus for Dead or Alive 4. Tecmo denies that such a payment was due.Last week, Yoshimi Yasuda, Tecmo’s president, announced he would step down for personal reasons on the day of the company’s interim results presentation.It was Mr Yasuda’s resignation that prompted Square Enix, which had been talking to Tecmo about a deal since May, to make the unusual move of making public its friendly offer before Tecmo’s acceptance. “We were worried about what would happen to our discussions,” said Yoichi Wada, president of Square Enix.Square Enix is offering Tecmo Y920 a share, a premium of 30 per cent to Tecmo’s share price before the bid was announced. That is equivalent to 22 times Tecmo’s own earnings forecast for 2008. Analysts said the deal was not expensive, because Tecmo has Y11.5bn in cash on its balance sheet.“Square [would only be] paying Y12bn in net cash for a business with Y2.5bn in annual operating profit,” said Pelham Smithers, an analyst at brokerage Pali International.Tecmo shares rose by their daily trading limit of 14 per cent to close at Y806; Square Enix shares added 2.6 per cent to Y3,610."
242;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-08-18T18:13:36Z;EA bid for Take-Two lapses;;Electronic Arts on Monday said it would no longer stand behind its $24.75-a-share takeover offer for rival games maker Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series, though it also edged a step closer to starting direct negotiations about a deal.The latest manoeuvring between the two games companies pointed to a potential breakthrough in a stand-off that has lasted nearly six months, since EA first went public with its unsolicited all-cash offer.Wall Street continued to anticipate that the long siege would end in an agreement. Hopes for a sweetened bid from EA faded, however, as the company said it would let its formal offer, for $25.74 a share, lapse on Monday night. Take-Two’s shares slipped on Monday, falling 69 cents to $2.15In a letter to Strauss Zelnick, chairman of Take-Two, John Riccitiello, chief executive of EA, said he was not prepared to stand behind the original offer “given the passage of time” since it was made, and that EA needed to carry out due diligence before being able to confirm the price. In a hint that the company might consider lowering its bid, he added: “We no longer believe we can integrate Take-Two ahead of the important holiday season.”“Much as we warned, the passage of time has eroded the value of this offer,” an EA spokesman added.The move came after Mr Zelnick wrote to his EA counterpart over the weekend offering to make a presentation to EA’s board outlining what he called Take-Two’s “strong operational and financial performance,” adding: “I believe our presentation will enable you to understand better the value of our Company to EA.” Take-Two has rejected EA’s offer as too low.The presentation, Mr Zelnick added, had been prepared by Take-Two as part of a review of its strategic alternatives, and that “other participants” have been involved in the process. However, despite the company’s efforts in recent months to flush out alternative bidders, no white knight has emerged.The signs of movement in the stand-off between the two companies followed a call that Mr Riccitiello made to Mr Zelnick last Friday, according to one person close to the situation. The call led Take-Two to make its offer to provide the more detailed management presentation, according to this person.On Monday, the two sides were still in discussion about the terms of a confidentiality agreement that EA would have to sign before Take-Two would agree to make the in-depth financial presentation.
243;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-07-31T15:23:12Z;Spore creatures could challenge copyright holders;;John Lasseter, chief creative officer at Pixar and Disney, loves playing with the Spore Creature Creator according to Maxis, Pixar’s Bay Area neighbour.But should he show alarm at what is being invented and uploaded online by others or welcome in a whole new generation of animators?Spore is Maxis’s long-awaited follow-up to The Sims, launching on September 5, and the Creature Creator is an appetiser that allows players to build life forms that can be placed in the game later and used to evolve civilisations and take part in interplanetary expansion.In the meantime, they can be uploaded to Sporepedia, a vast shareable online database of user creations. Electronic Arts, Maxis’s parent, said this week 2.5m copies of the Creator had either been downloaded for free or bought as a boxed version, while more than 2m creatures have been created so far.I received a full demo of the game from Thomas Vu, a Maxis producer, this week. He showed me the flexibility of the Creature Creator in shaping backbones and bodies and attaching all manner of limbs and appendages. This was only one of eight Creators in the game as well, with others available to make objects such as vehicles and buildings.I could imagine Mr Lasseter and his Pixar animators using the Creators to prototype future animation characters, such is the sophistication of the tools and the flexibility they allow.In fact, as we flicked through Sporepedia, Mr Vu pointed out a very passable imitation of Pixar’s Wall-E character in the library, created by a player.I wondered if Mr Lasseter would approve of this as adding extra buzz for his movie or be more inclined to reach for the phone and call his lawyer.The possibilities in Spore for making realistic imitations have not been seen in video games before and the user-generated content it will create is going to launch it into the realm of YouTube in risking copyright complaints from intellectual-property owners.It also means questionable content of another kind can be created, such as the flying genitalia that has struck the Second Life virtual world.Maxis says there will be parental controls and the Spore community has been very good at policing itself and flagging such content for removal so far.On the opportunity to reproduce accurately characters, buildings, cars and other trademarked products, the studio says it will adopt YouTube’s stance of taking objects down on requests from the copyright owners.They could be kept very busy, Spore users have already created more species than exist on Earth with the Creature Creator, just imagine what they can do when they get more tools.
244;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-07-27T17:05:00Z;Hold the line, I’m reaching Level Six;;It may be called the iPhone, not the iConsole, but the biggest impact of the latest version of Apple’s signature device has been as a video game machine.In the three days after the iPhone 3G went on sale on July 11, 10m applications were downloaded from the company’s online App Store, which was launched simultaneously.The store represents Apple’s attempt to open up the iPhone platform to third-party developers in the hope they will develop compelling applications to increase its popularity. Over a third of the nearly 1,000 applications available are games. Seven out of the top 10 paid-for applications (about 20 per cent of applications are free) are also games, priced from $2 to $10.To the video games industry, such figures are a compelling demonstration of the emergence of a new platform for their wares.At the E3 convention in Los Angeles this month, publishers showed off their iPhone games and there was a noticeable buzz about the device, according to Travis Boatman, head of Mobile Studios at Electronic Arts.“In all the time I’ve been making mobile games, I haven’t seen as much excitement as I have over the last couple of weeks and months,” he said.The success of the iPhone as a games platform is a challenge not only to other handset makers but also to the games hardware companies Nintendo and Sony with their DS and PlayStation Portable handheld devices.It features similar capabilities such as a powerful processor, rich graphics and wi-fi connectivity. But it also has advances on the existing consoles with its motion-sensing and touch-screen capabilities.Developers were given only a few months before the App Store’s launch to come up with the first games, so most have begun with simple fare.Electronic Arts launched Scrabble, Sudoku and Tetris. Shaking the phone engages its accelerometer to shuffle the letters in Scrabble, while Tetris players draw a finger across the screen to determine the shape of the next piece to fall. More sophisticated games are on the way. In Spore, players can create exotic creatures by pinching or expanding torsos and body parts with their fingers on the iPhone’s multi-touch screen. They then tip the phone from side to side to guide their creatures through a maze.As something of a hybrid, the iPhone is likely to attract a wide range of game publishers, according to Greg Ballard, chief executive of Glu Mobile, one of the leading publishers of mobile phone games. “It probably opens up the possibility that a lot of different segments of the game business can bring their games to the platform, so it’s going to be broader than either the casual online business or the console or even the mobile phone business.”Mike Pagano, an associate producer at EA Mobile, says his company is looking at adapting both games from the PSP and DS and simple ones from mobile phones.Apple has made developing for the iPhone attractive by taking only a 30 per cent cut of sales in its App Store. This compares with a 50/50 revenue share deal in some cases with mobile carriers in Europe.Gameloft, another leading mobile game publisher, launched games for touch-screen phones made by HTC, LG and Samsung in February.“But the iPhone is the first handset, aside from Motorola’s Razr, that has mass market appeal,” says Sanette Chao of Gameloft. “The mobile industry has been fairly stagnant for a while but, with the introduction of [Nokia’s upcoming] N-Gage [gaming platform] and the iPhone and its competitors, I think in the second half there is going to be a big movement.”The company initially launched six games for the iPhone, selling for between $8 and $10. The iPhone’s capabilities mean it can charge more than for regular mobile phone games that can cost between $2 and $4 a month to play.Greg Ballard says the openness of Apple’s platform bodes well for the iPhone’s future. “One truly brilliant thing Apple has done is to make it as simple as it is to develop for, so a lot of people who wouldn’t be able to program for other devices, including the DS and PSP, now are assembling teams for the iPhone platform.”
245;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-07-20T16:36:39Z;Sony sets 150m sales target for PS3;;Kaz Hirai, chief executive of Sony’s PlayStation games console business, has set an ambitious target of reaching nearly 150m in sales for its slow-starting PlayStation 3 console.Sony told those attending the video game industry’s E3 convention last week that sales of its original PlayStation, launched in 1994, had reached 102m units and the PlayStation 2 console had now passed 140m worldwide in its ninth year on sale.Steering Sony’s loss-making games unit into profitability is Mr Hirai’s most pressing task. The massive costs of investing in the games console, which is equipped with a Blu-ray player and the powerful “Cell” chip, means that Sony is still incurring a loss on every PS3 sold.Mr Hirai, in a Financial Times interview, said his aim was for the PS3 to surpass sales of the PS2 over a similar time period.“It’s not fun for me replicating the PS2 numbers. I’ve seen that movie already,” he said.“I want to try to see if we can exceed the PS2 numbers after nine years, otherwise why are we in this business?”Twenty months after the PS3’s release, the console is barely 10 per cent towards his target. Sales to the end of Sony’s fiscal year in March were 12.85m and it expects to sell another 10m in the current fiscal year.The PS3 has trailed Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and Nintendo’s Wii in sales. PS3 sales have picked up this year and it outsold the 360 in the US in June by nearly two-to-one, helped by the release of its exclusive title, Metal Gear Solid 4.Peter Moore, who headed Microsoft’s Xbox business until joining Electronic Arts a year ago, said that while Nintendo and now Microsoft are profitable, and Sony is catching up, the Wii is winning the console wars.“It looks to me as if the Wii is going to have at least half the installed base of the overall industry and the Xbox 360 and PS3 are going to fight over the balance, based on the run-rates we’re seeing,” he told the FT.Michael Pachter, video games analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities, said he expected PS3 sales would accelerate if Sony could cut the price significantly from the current $400.“It’s highly likely that when the PS3 gets below $200, it will sell as well as the PS2.”
246;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-07-14T20:15:10Z;Games industry develops broader market sales;;Video game publishers may be promoting their holiday-season games at the E3 convention in LA this week, but there are signs the industry is becoming less reliant on blockbuster titles and Christmas gifts.While publishers still book the bulk of their sales from holiday-season releases, more regular revenue streams are developing that are starting to flatten out traditionally lumpy balance sheets.”We now have a number of businesses that fit in the category of being non-cyclical,” says John Riccitiello, chief executive of Electronic Arts, the largest pure-play publisher.He cites mobile games, EA’s Pogo service for downloadable PC games and its The Sims franchise, with its regular release of expansion packs for the virtual world and sales of in-game items.The merger of Activision with Vivendi’s games division last week created a major new hybrid model for the industry. Activision Blizzard combines a successful console games publisher with the creator of World of Warcraft, an online PC role-playing game that has attracted more than 10m paying subscribers.In addition to monthly subscriptions, the new company has said it could become a rival to iTunes with a music download service, an extension of its successful Guitar Hero game, which has seen more than 15m song downloads.Robin Kaminsky, head of publishing, says online downloads of game extensions, such as new maps for its Call of Duty combat title, can also stretch out the revenue stream from a game.”This increases the number of consumers coming in as late adopters, lets us sell those games at launch-pricing for a longer period of time and extends the lifecycle of those games so they’re not just launched and then abandoned [in terms of development],” she says.Martin Zagorsek, vice president of games and software at the NPD research firm, says as long as games and consoles are part of gift-giving, video games will remain highly seasonal.But he says the expanding demographic of gamers will have an effect.”Children are much more likely to be given gifts than adults, but as this becomes more of an all-age activity, the older gamers are more likely to buy things for themselves when they feel like it, which will alter the seasonality,” he says.The Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) at the Los Angeles Convention Center will feature previews of much anticipated games such as Gears of War 2, Fallout 3 and Dead Space.Sales of console games were up 62 per cent on last year to the end of May, according to NPD, the increase from $1.7bn to $2.8bn being attributable in large part to the release of the blockbuster Grand Theft Auto IV.
247;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-07-13T20:25:50Z;Big players change games industry rules;;As the players get bigger in the video game industry, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, traditionally its biggest show, appears to be shrinking in importance.E3 takes place this week at the Los Angeles Convention Center, but Activision Blizzard, formed by the merger last week of Activision and Vivendi’s games division, is not attending.In May, both Activision and Vivendi Games also withdrew their membership of the Entertainment Software Association, which organises the show.Bobby Kotick, chief executive of the new company, which describes itself as “the world’s most profitable pure-play online and console game publisher”, told Variety the company was now too big for its needs to be met by the ESA and suggested it would be appointing its own lobbyist in Washington in place of the association.E3 was deliberately downsized last year. Attendees were reduced from 60,000 to about 5,000 after publishers said the show had become too big and expensive, and this year’s show will continue on this smaller scale.Nowadays, bigger companies seem happier holding their own events and conventions for gamers or putting money into game shows in Leipzig and Tokyo that can expand their presence internationally.The replacement of the cacophony of demonstrations from the gamut of game companies at E3 with a smaller, calmer affair is a sign of the consolidation taking place and the revised thinking of the new industry leaders.Vivendi has made the biggest move of the leading media companies on the industry, owning a 52 per cent stake in the new Activision Blizzard.“I think that interest has always been there from the major media companies,” says John Riccitiello, chief executive of the long-time industry leader, Electronic Arts. “The Vivendis and Disneys and Time Warners and News Corps want to participate more directly in the games business.”Disney and Time Warner have stepped up their investments in the business and News Corp has been rumoured as a possible rival to EA in its $2bn bid for Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto franchise.Mr Kotick, in a Financial Times interview, said Hollywood studios were increasingly buying smaller publishers as they looked to exploit their own intellectual property. “It goes in phases, Disney and Warner are new competitors. Disney has a lot of natural advantages in that they own a lot of compelling properties. Warner too, with Batman and Superman.”Although Activision Blizzard and EA bestride the “third-party” publishers, Mr Kotick pointed out they could still be outspent and outbid for talent by the first-party players – the console makers who also have game-development studios.The console makers are expected to make the biggest news at the show. Edward Woo, games analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities, says Microsoft is almost certain to cut the price of its Xbox 360, while Nintendo and Sony are rumoured to be updating their handheld gaming devices.On the game front, E3 appears to be heading for a bad dose of sequel-itis.“Fallout 3, Gears of War 2, Fable 2, Resident Evil 5, Halo Wars, Resistance 2 are sequels,” says Peer Schneider of the IGN game network. “We’re all really hoping that there’s some fresh blood coming in, new games that are not just continuations of existing franchises.”

249;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-07-09T01:49:06Z;Pledge to rethink games sector tax breaks;;The government has moved to rebuild a troubled relationship with the video games industry by promising it will investigate tax breaks for developers to compete with similar incentives from countries such as France and Canada.Margaret Hodge, creative industries minister, told a games industry seminar in Westminster on Tuesday: “We have now succeeded in persuading colleagues across government that we should look again at this issue, particularly in light of the French situation.”Last December, the European Commission gave the French government the go-ahead to allow 20 per cent tax relief for developers that met certain cultural criteria.Mrs Hodge stressed that the UK games industry would “need to demonstrate a genuine market failure” for her department to persuade the Treasury to introduce a similar scheme.“We are nervous about these forms of tax relief,” she said. “Because there is a fiscal squeeze, we don’t want to get into an international Dutch auction where we vie to outbid each other on tax relief.”Representatives of the games industry welcomed the minister’s admission of its “huge importance” to the economy and the “range of challenges” it faced, from skills shortages and competition from low-cost economies to intellectual property protection and child safety regulation.David Braben, chairman and founder of Frontier Developments, one of the UK’s largest independent games developers, said there seemed to be a “slight softening” in tone from the minister towards the games industry after a blunt rebuff last year.“They are conciliatory noises,” he said. “I am heartened.”But Mrs Hodge put forward few new ideas to tackle the dearth of well-qualified games developers.Mary Matthews, a director at Blitz Games Studios, another UK-based developer, told the seminar that “skills shortages are constraining our business. We can’t do what we want to do because we can’t find the right people.”She said of the 4 per cent of its salary bill that Blitz invested in training, a quarter was to bring graduates “up to scratch” even after completing degrees purportedly preparing them for a games development career.The proposed introduction of the British Board of Film Classification’s age ratings system to UK games was another contentious issue at the industry gathering.Many in the games industry feel that Pegi, the existing, pan-European self-audit system, provides sufficient warning for parents and adults buying the 3 per cent of games that carry an 18 rating.The BBFC’s system may be more recognisable, they agree, but would add substantial administrative overheads that could delay games releases in the UK.
250;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Scrabble vs Scrabulous;;It took a long time, but Hasbro, the owner of the rights to Scrabble in the US, has teamed up with Electronic Arts to finally launch an online version of the popular crossword game. The game is available at Pogo.com today, and is scheduled to make its debut on Facebook later this month. So what does this mean for Scrabulous, Scrabble’s ersatz competitior, which took Facebook world by storm when it launched last year?The prognosis isn’t good. Scrabulous has been under a cloud since January when Hasbro and Mattel, which owns the international rights to the game, sent letters to Facebook asking it to remove the game, citing copyright infringement.Meanwhile, an online version of Scrabble created by Mattel and Real Networks has been struggling to gain traction since it launched in April for audiences outside the US and Canada. To date, the game has managed to attract fewer than 6,000 daily users on Facebook – less than two per cent of Scrabulous’s daily audience of 450,000.Hasbro and EA may do better with the launch of Scrabble in the US and Canada. But even if the North American version attracts five times the interest of its international counterpart, it will barely make a dent in Scrabulous’s audience numbers.In January, Scrabulous’s creators claimed to be making more than $25,000 a week in advertising revenues. With the launch of a US version of online Scrabble imminent, the door is now open for Scrabble’s owners to go after their fair share of that revenue by pursuing legal action.Forcing Scrabulous to shut down would no doubt alienate tens of thousands of loyal Scrabulous fans. But with thousands of new users joining Facebook daily, it might make sense for Scrabble’s owners to risk some user backlash now in hopes of a bigger payoff later. Besides, if the game is addictive enough, even the most disgruntled former Scrabulous users may not be able to stay away for too long.
251;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-06-26T21:00:38Z;Habbo hits a hundred million teen avatars;;The most financially successful virtual worlds are not 3D and sophisticated, but flat and appealing to younger audiences.Think Neopets, Webkinz, Club Penguin and Runescape, not Second Life.Habbo, whose graphics are reminiscent of the Code Monkeys cartoon and 8-bit 80s video games, announced today that its 100-millionth avatar had been created.That does not translate as 100m active members – the service had 10.3m unique visitors in May, according to comScore – but it is still an impressive indication of the growth of the service since its launch in Finland eight years ago.Financial comparisons are difficult. Electronic Arts announced in April that it had sold 100m units of the The Sims, the video-game precursor to online virtual worlds. Blizzard Entertainment said in January it had passed 10m paying monthly subscribers for its World of Warcraft online game.The companies do not break out the hard cash they make from these properties and neither does Sulake, the privately held Finnish company that owns Habbo and dropped the “Hotel” from Habbo Hotel in 2006.However, it did reveal today it was “on track to reach our projected revenue goal of $85m, which indicates a healthy profit for the company” in 2008.Teemu Huuhtanen, executive vice president of marketing, ad sales and business development, told me he thought Habbo was the largest independent virtual world, following Disney’s acquisition of Club Penguin for $700m last year, with its more than 20m users.Monthly visitors are up 51 per cent on a year ago in Habbo’s 32 communities worldwide.” I think the biggest reason for the growth is the redesign we did in October/November focusing on easy access and play, making sure that anyone without previous knowledge of virtual worlds could come to the web site and create their own character and start exploring,” he said.Habbo has also partnered with movie studios and brands to help make the site more relevant to its teen target audience.Around 85 per cent of revenues come from users paying for virtual items in the world, but advertising and sponsorship is expected to take a bigger share this year as the medium matures.The maturity of its users does create a churn problem for Habbo. While Second Life may lose users because of the level of difficulty they face, Habbo members simply grow up and move on to more adult virtual worlds.“Every year we need to reach the users in each market that turn 13, so it’s like a constant flow of new customers for us,” said Mr Huuhtanen.
252;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Beatles seek to join video game revolution;;Beatles representatives are in talks with two companies to create a Beatles-themed video game in a move that could pave the way for a broader licensing of the Fab Four’s catalogue.The representatives have held discussions with both Activision and MTV Games, the respective makers of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band games, in which players strum along to favourite songs or form virtual bands.A final deal would be worth several million dollars, according to a person familiar with the talks, and could be reached in a matter of weeks. However, it would have first to win the blessing of both Apple Corps, the company established by the band to oversee its business interests, and EMI, the UK music group that owns the Beatles master recordings. Both declined to comment.The surviving Beatles and their heirs have been cautious about exploiting their material on new platforms. They were slow to re-issue their albums on compact disc.In spite of repeated discussions, EMI and Apple Corps have yet to license Beatles recordings for digital use, including for sale through Apple’s iTunes music store.Apple Corps has become more active in recent months since Jeff Jones took over as chief executive.The company, whose board includes Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Olivia Harrison and Yoko Ono Lennon, has allowed Beatles compositions to be used on American Idol and in a Las Vegas show.Martin Bandier, chief executive of Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which controls more than 200 Beatles copyrights, said the exposure on American Idol had yielded a number of inquiries, including from mobile phone carriers.“To my view, it’s only a matter of time before we see Beatles songs that are the original recordings in motion pictures, in television work, and yes, maybe even one day in a commercial,” said Mr Bandier, arguing that sensitivities about commercialism should be balanced against the merits of exposing the band to a younger generation.The Beatles could help sway a battle between Activision and Electronic Arts, the biggest US video game publishers. Activision has generated more than $1bn so far from Guitar Hero as sales approach 20m units.EA, in partnership with MTV, introduced Rock Band in November. Thanks to added functionality, the game has sold more than 3m copies.An Activision spokesman declined to comment on whether it was competing for Beatles rights. MTV said: “We are talking to virtually every major rock artist all the time about ways we might get them involved in Rock Band.”
253;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;EA spurns Take-Two, spawns Spore;;John Riccitiello, Electronic Arts chief executive, seems more interested in playing his company’s new Spore game than closing a deal for rival Take-Two.“I’ve created 10 creatures already,” he told the William Blair investors conference today.EA has just released its Spore Creature Creator, which should increase anticipation for the game’s September release by allowing players to begin building the inhabitants of the strange new worlds made possible in Spore.EA also extended its tender offer to Take-Two shareholders to July 18. Fewer shares are being tendered each time it does this. The figure of 6,139,824 represents just 7.9 per cent of the outstanding share count.EA has said it is willing to pay around $2bn for Take-Two, but it has reduced its original offer of $26 a share to $25.74 a share. “Our offer price remains unchanged,” it said today.Clearly, shareholders expect more and Take-Two’s board reiterated today that it viewed the price as significantly undervaluing the publisher of Grand Theft Auto IV.It also hinted again that there were alternative suitors to EA. However, there is no evidence that any other company has begun any meaningful negotiations, which means Mr Riccitiello can bide his time, continuing to design odd characters with sticky-out eyes.
254;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-06-06T21:39:09Z;Software allowing mix of applications is key;;A 3G iPhone may grab the headlines at Apple’s global developer conference on Monday, but new software is likely to have a more lasting impact.The conference is expected to mark the arrival of third-party applications for the iPhone from Apple developers, in what is being seen by analysts as the creation of an important software platform for the mobile age.“You get this sense that Apple is redefining mobile computing,” says Tim Bajarin, principal analyst at the Creative Strategies consultancy.“What caused products like the original IBM PC and the Apple II to take off [in the 1970s and 80s] was the software applications, like WordStar, Lotus 1-2-3 and VisiCalc.“Software has always been the key, and what Apple is doing represents the beginning of a rich new computing platform in mobile.”Three months ago, Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, identified its developer community as the source of fresh impetus for iPhone sales. In a “Software Roadmap” event at Apple headquarters, he announced a software development kit (SDK) for the iPhone that would enable them to build programs for it.A group of partners demonstrated applications that they had put together in just two weeks. Electronic Arts showed off a version of its Spore game, taking advantage of the iPhone’s motion-sensitivity, Salesforce.com showed an application for sales representatives, and AOL demonstrated an instant-messaging program.Mr Jobs also announced a virtual “App Store”, similar to the iTunes store, for the next 2.0 software update for the iPhone. It would be the one place where users could buy software approved by Apple, with the company taking a 30 per cent cut of sales by developers.At the same event, John Doerr, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers, announced the launch of a $100m “iFund” to invest in companies developing applications and services for the iPhone.Apple has seen more than 200,000 downloads of its SDK since the event, and Kleiner Perkins has received close to 2,000 business plans from entrepreneurs.“It’s pretty darn exciting,” says Matt Murphy, the KPCB partner vetting the process. “That’s easily a factor of 20 more than the plans we would have received without announcing the iFund. It’s a leading indicator of the swarm of activity that’s going on.”Software developers are faced with a much harder task than those who have created more than 1,000 web applications for the iPhone since last year.Apple has been protective, imposing restrictions such as allowing only one application to run at a time.Nick Piggott, head of creative technology at GCap Media, the UK commercial radio group, is one of those disappointed with the SDK.“We were hoping the SDK would allow us to write an application that would allow users to listen to the radio on the iPhone while doing something else [on the device]. All the evidence is that the SDK doesn’t allow you to do that,” he says.Mr Murphy says he is confident the problem of not allowing applications to run in the background will be resolved.Apple has already claimed a 5 per cent share in mobile operating systems, little more than a year after entering the market with the iPhone. But it has a long way to go before it can claim leadership of the mobile software market.Symbian, the mobile software company in effect controlled by Nokia, continues to dominate the sector.As the world’s leading mobile phone maker, Nokia is the dominant force in smartphones, the sector that Apple is targeting with the iPhone. The Finnish manufacturer accounted for 45 per cent of the 32m smartphones sold in the first quarter of this year, according to Gartner.Apple also faces competition from Microsoft and Google in the shape of the Windows Mobile and Android platforms. Google hinted last week that it would open its own version of the App Store, and Microsoft could do the same.“We do it with Xbox, we do it with Zune, it would be logical to do it with [Windows] mobile,” says Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division. “Carriers already have limited versions of this, for things like ringtones.”Mr Murphy says about 85 per cent of the applications for the iPhone he is seeing are aimed at consumers. He says the best groups will show originality in bringing together people, places and events.“We think most, if not all, of those companies are being formed right now in this area of open mobile. The scale we are looking for is what will be the Ebay, the Amazon and the Google of the mobile internet.”Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw in London
255;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-06-05T22:53:40Z;‘Grand Theft Auto’ gives Take-Two a profit;;Grand Theft Auto IV, which has broken all records for video games since its release six weeks ago, returned its publisher Take-Two to profitability in the second quarter.GTA IV was released on April 29, only a day before the end of Take-Two’s fiscal quarter, but recorded $310m in worldwide sales as 3.6m copies were bought on the day of its launch.The New York-based publisher, subject of a $2bn takeover bid by its rival Electronic Arts, on Thursday reported profits of $98.2m or $1.29 per share, compared to a loss of $51.2m or 71 cents a share a year earlier.It said GTA IV sold 6m units in its first week, worth $500m. Eleven million units had been sold to retailers by May 31, with around 8.5m sold through to consumers.GTA IV’s sales beat the $300m recorded by Halo 3, the previous record-holder, in its opening week. The movie Iron Man, released at the same time as GTA IV, earned $201m globally in its first five days.Take-Two reported $539.8m in second-quarter game revenues, compared to just $205.4m in the same quarter in 2007. Analysts had expected revenues of $499m.”Take-Two’s performance has exceeded expectations through the first half of fiscal 2008, clearly demonstrating the creative, operational and financial strength of our business,” said Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two chairman.The company raised its forecasts for the full year to $1.4bn-$1.5bn in revenues and earnings per share of $1.65 - $1.85, up from from $1.25bn-$1.4bn and $1.35 to $1.55 per share. For the current quarter, it expected sales of $325m - $375m, compared to the analyst consensus of $322m gathered by Reuters Estimates.The company’s management has rebuffed an offer from Electronic Arts, currently worth $25.74 a share, saying it undervalued the company.EA has extended a tender offer to shareholders until June 16 but has so far found few takers.On Wednesday, it reported it had reached an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that would allow regulators time to study the proposed deal.Take-Two shares were down 0.4 per cent in after-hours trading in New York at $27.53.
256;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-06-04T18:34:58Z;New generation of adverts for Sony’s PS3;;Sony has announced the introduction of dynamic in-game advertising on its PlayStation 3 console, opening up what is expected to be a significant new revenue stream for publishers and advertising networks.The launch of online technology that allows advertising billboards and displays in games to be refreshed, rather than remain fixed, will make gaming more like television – advertisers will be able to run more up-to-date campaigns and spread them across a range of titles.Yankee Group, the technology research firm, forecasts worldwide in-game advertising revenues will grow to $970m in 2011.Sony chose in-game advertising network IGA Worldwide on Wednesday as its first partner rather than smaller rivals Double Fusion or Google-owned Adscape.Massive, an in-game advertising network owned by Microsoft that provides adverts for Xbox 360 consoles, was never considered by the rival console maker.Phil Rosenberg, senior vice-president for PlayStation in the US, said there would be a “revenue component” for both Sony, publishers and advertising networks in the deal but declined to provide details.He said the first title to feature dynamic advertising was likely to be an update to Sony’s own action game, Pain, on the PlayStation Network.In the past, advertising has been fixed and “baked into” games once they were completed but internet connectivity in the latest consoles is opening up new markets for advertising networks that have previously focused on the PC.Nintendo has yet to announce plans for in-game advertising on its Wii console.As Sony made its announcement on Wednesday, IGA unveiled a two-year agreement with Electronic Arts, the biggest video game publisher.It said it would be EA’s exclusive partner for enabling in-game advertising for its games on the PS3, which has sold 13m units worldwide.In March, EA announced an expansion and two-year extension of an agreement with Massive to offer in-game advertising in Xbox 360 games and most of its PC games on a global basis.US in-game advertising spending is expected to increase to $403m this year from $295m in 2007, according to EMarketer, the research firm.Its estimates include both static and dynamic adverts, product placement, game-portal display adverts and sponsorship.Google bought Adscape last year for a reported $23m with the intention of integrating in-game advertising into its larger advertising platform.
257;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Video game developers push for tax breaks;;British video games developers are redoubling pressure on the government to address a lack of tax breaks and skills that could set the industry even further behind foreign rivals.Fifteen video games companies have now joined “Games Up?”, a lobbying group led by Tiga and Elspa, the trade bodies for developers and publishers respectively.The backers include many of the industry’s biggest names, from local groups such as Eidos (part of SCi Entertainment) and Codemasters to global giants Electronic Arts, Take Two Interactive and Ubisoft – even though several of these companies have been lured to Canada by tax rebates and grants from the Montreal government.Last week the US state of Georgia approved legislation offering tax credits of up to 30 per cent for entertainment productions, such as films and games. Richard Wilson, chief executive of Tiga, the UK trade association for games developers, said Georgia’s announcement was “emblematic of the increasingly unfair competition that the UK games industry faces”.He said the success of Canada’s progressive tax scheme for developers helped its games production industry overtake the UK’s as the world’s third largest in 2006, and South Korea is now not far behind.The games market was worth £16bn in 2007, according to Tiga, while UK-made games generated £4bn globally from £1.4bn in inward investment between 2006 and 2008.It cited figures by Games Investor Consulting that suggested if its proposals on skills and tax credits were implemented, the UK games industry would receive an additional investment of £220m over five years, creating an additional 1,500 jobs, rather than the projected decline from 10,000 UK developers today.Even with the recent launch of Grand Theft Auto IV, a big-budget blockbuster developed in Scotland by Rockstar North and published by Take Two, the UK’s development industry is past its heyday, as developers of past successes such as Tomb Raider relocate overseas. “All our key competitors offer tax breaks and grants, putting UK developers at a disadvantage,” said Mr Wilson.He added that the government “at the very least” should follow the example of France, which last December cleared 20 per cent tax relief for developers through the European Commission. Tiga also wants a “finishing school for games developers” to help improve skills in the longer term.
258;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-05-12T20:50:09Z;Wall Street gains as oil retreats;;"US stocks posted their best gains in a week on Monday as oil prices retreated from record highs, the dollar gained strength and investors looked to pick up bargains following the sharp falls of the previous session.MBIA, the world’s largest bond insurer, posted a $2.4bn loss, suggesting the slump
in mortgage-related securities shows little sign of easing.Unrealised losses from derivatives were $3.58bn amid ongoing credit market deterioration.The loss was more than twice analysts’ estimates, equating to $13.03 a share for the quarter compared with profit of $198.6m, or $1.46 a share, for the first quarter of 2007.But MBIA shares rose by 5.4 per cent to $9.94 as traders took the view that the disclosure of losses meant the worst was over for the embattled company.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was 1.1 per cent higher at 1,404.06 while the Nasdaq Composite was 1.8 per cent higher at 2,488.49. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1 per cent higher at 12,876.31.All leading market indicators had fallen on Friday, wiping out the modest gains of the previous session and ending the week on a down note after insurer American International Group reported a bad quarter.This revived worries about the credit crisis, and record oil and gas prices exacerbated fears about the threat of inflation.But lower crude prices pushed stock prices higher across the board on Monday.Oil prices slipped after last week’s record-breaking run when crude reached a new high in each session and topped $126 a barrel on Friday. Nymex June West Texas Intermediate retreated $1.73 to $124.23 a barrel on Monday.Stock market investors digested economic news that showed the federal government ran a budget surplus of $159.3bn in April, smaller than a year ago.The Treasury Department said the budget surplus for April was 10.4 per cent lower than in April 2007.In 2007, the April budget surplus came in at $177.7bn. Economists had predicted the monthly surplus would narrow to $157.5bn.Charles Evans, Chicago Fed president, said overall economic conditions should improve in the second half of 2008 as drags on activity from housing market weakness and tough credit conditions start to diminish.But he said the improvement would not be enough to prevent economic activity from relative sluggishness.HSBC predicted the US housing market downturn could last for at least another year as the UK-based banking group revealed it had set aside $5.8bn as a result of the credit turmoil in the first quarter.The bank, one of the first to suffer from the meltdown in the US subprime mortgage market, said any recovery in the US housing market was unlikely this year. Its ADRs in New York were up 3.1 per cent at $86.68.IndyMac Bancorp reported a net loss of $184.2m, or $2.27 per share, for the first quarter of 2008 compared with net earnings of $52.4m, or 70 cents per share, in the first quarter last year. Shares in the company fell 10.8 per cent to $3.06.Other companies in focus on Monday included Cablevision, which said it would buy Newsday from the Tribune Company in a deal worth $650m after News Corp dropped out of the running for the Long Island tabloid.Cablevision will own 97 per cent of the company Shares in Cablevision were down 1.8 per cent at $24.52.News Corp, which owns the rival New York Post, dropped out of the race at the weekend after submitting a $580m bid for the paper. News Corp rose 1.1 per cent to $19.57.Research in Motion unveiled its first major new BlackBerry model, the Bold, in more than a year, sending its shares up 6.9 per cent to $141.97.Sprint Nextel posted a wider first-quarter loss as it continued to lose long-term subscribers and absorb costs connected to its acquisition in 2005 of Nextel.Shares in Sprint fell 1.5 per cent to $9.24.Video game company Electronic Arts announced late on Friday that it had received debt financing commitments of up to $1bn for its $2bn tender offer for rival Take-Two Interactive Software.Shares in the company rose 3.2 per cent to $54.27."
259;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-05-09T01:18:52Z;Online grows, audience broadens, Activision profits;;Subscriptions from online games are now bringing in $1bn a year in the US, according to a report by the NPD research firm.Its data cover massively-multiplayer PC games (MMOs) such as World of Warcraft, casual games and console services such as Microsoft’s Xbox Live.NPD gave the top five MMO games as World of Warcraft, then Runescape, Lord of the Rings Online, Final Fantasy XI and City of Heroes.Top online gaming sites were Pogo.com, followed by RealArcade.com, Bigfishgames.com, Gametap.com and Disney.com.Video game publishers are increasingly looking to online and recurring subscriptions to give themselves extra, steadier revenue streams compared to the lumpy retail sales of games.Activision will achieve that balance with the merger with Vivendi’s games division by mid-year, combining its powerful game franchises with World of Warcraft from Vivendi’s Blizzard studio.In its fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday, Activision followed in the footsteps of Electronic Arts and THQ in announcing it would begin recognising a substantial amount of net revenues and cost of sales from online-enabled games over a service period, expected to be six months beginning the month after shipment.“I still think that the bulk of Activision revenues will come from the sales of retail products, Blizzard is a different situation,” Bobby Kotick, chief executive, told me.Activision had a blow-out quarter and year. Revenues for the fiscal year to March 31 of $2.9bn were up 92 per cent, helped by the success of its Call of Duty 4 combat game and the Guitar Hero III rhythm game. Fourth-quarter revenues were up 93 per cent at $602.5m even though no new titles were released.“The one thing I think we are starting to see is new users,” said Mr Kotick.“You are seeing the older demographic and some younger consumers coming in. The type of content like Guitar Hero is more broadly appealing, production values are better – the developers of Grand Theft Auto did a brilliant job – and the physical interface is improving with products like Guitar Hero and the Nintendo Wii. All this is driving new consumers and I think that will continue.”
260;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Grand Theft Auto sells 6m in first week;;The Grand Theft Auto IV video game has stolen all entertainment records for an opening week, with global retail sales of about 6m copies, or $500m, according to Take-Two, its publisher.The launch figures eclipse those of Microsoft’s Halo 3 game, released last September. They also exceed opening weeks for the film and book record-holders, Spider-Man 3 and the Harry Potter series.GTA IV’s success is expected to give a significant boost to sales of the two consoles on which it has initially been released – Sony’s PlayStation 3 and Microsoft’s Xbox 360.It may also embolden Take-Two’s management, which has described a $2bn takeover bid by Electronic Arts, the largest video games publisher, as undervaluing the company.“Grand Theft Auto IV’s first-week performance represents the largest launch in the history of interactive entertainment, and we believe these retail sales levels surpass any movie or music launch to date,” said Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two chairman.The game, from Take-Two’s Scottish developer Rockstar Games, tells the story of an eastern European immigrant called Niko being sucked into a life of crime in Liberty City – a virtual version of New York. It has earned unprecedented ratings from critics.GTA IV’s sales beat the $300m recorded by Halo 3, the previous record-holder, in its opening week.Global sales on April 29, its opening day, of 3.6m units worth $310m compared with $170m in US sales for Halo in its first 24 hours.Iron Man, released last weekend as Hollywood’s first blockbuster of the summer film season, took in $104m at the US box office in its first three days and $201m globally in its first five days. Spider-Man 3 had a record US debut of $151m on the same weekend last year.Comparisons are difficult, given the $10 average price of a cinema ticket and the $60 charged for the basic version of GTA IV.Films also make more money as they become DVDs and are sold to TV and cable channels, although Grand Theft Auto will have new revenue streams.Additional episodic content will be released online for the Xbox 360 and the publishers will profit from in-game advertising and associated music sales.

262;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-05-05T19:16:38Z;Out of the door: Tax treatment tempts businesses to move country;;When Halliburton moved its headquarters from Houston to Dubai last year, the oil services group provoked a political storm. Despite assurances that the company was not seeking to avoid tax or scrutiny, the move was lambasted by Democrats as an example of corporate greed. Senator Hillary Clinton led the attack, denouncing the move as “disgraceful”.On the other side of the Atlantic, the spotlight is also on corporate defections after two big UK companies said last month they were shifting to Ireland for tax reasons. Others have also hinted at leaving. When United Business Media, a trade publisher, announced the move of its headquarters to Ireland, Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury affairs spokesman, criticised this as “blatant tax avoidance”.Politicians fear loss of jobs and tax revenues when companies move their headquarters. But their moral indignation cuts little ice with multinationals whose ties with their home countries have diminished because of international expansion and cross-border mergers.Over the last decade, 6 per cent of multinationals have relocated, partly for tax reasons, according to research from Oxford University’s Centre for Business Taxation. Companies competing with rivals based in lower-tax regimes are under pressure to cut their tax bills. Moreover, they are being wooed as never before by small countries keen to attract skilled jobs or create a larger tax base.UBS, the investment bank, predicts a “gradual erosion of governments’ ability to tax”. When Shire, the UK pharmaceutical company, announced its move to low-tax Ireland last month, Amit Kara, director of UBS, said: “This is the kind of tax competition we should expect. The pressure will remain on countries such as the UK to continue lowering corporation tax especially for the fleet-footed. The tax burden may shift to smaller companies.”At first sight, there is little reason for governments to panic about the threat of shifting headquarters. Companies will still pay tax on the factories, sales and other profitable activities in the countries where they operate. But finance ministries fear that migrating companies will find new ways to strip the tax base of the countries where they operate. Academic research published last year showed that foreign-owned manufacturers in Europe paid less than half as much tax as domestically owned businesses.Julian Alworth, an associate fellow at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, sees fiscal reasons as dominant in determining relocations. He told a recent conference: “When you look at why companies are moving headquarters, it is often to reduce the liability in the country where their headquarters are located and where they have their operations.” He cited a controversial attempt by Stanley Works, the US tool manufacturer, to move its headquarters to Bermuda in 2002, which was ditched after a political outcry.The suspicions of finance ministries are also aroused by the mobility of the income that companies derive from intellectual property or financing operations. Many big countries attempt to trap this income in their tax net using anti-avoidance rules. By moving to a more lenient regime, companies hope to escape these restrictions.Boasting an attractive tax regime for intellectual property has become part of the marketing pitch for countries wanting to attract foreign corporations, particularly the regional European headquarters of US multinationals. Kraft, Google, Electronic Arts and Yahoo have all recently switched their European headquarters from the UK to Switzerland. Ebay, Amazon and Microsoft have moved to Luxembourg. The Netherlands boasts names such as Cisco Systems, Nike and Starbucks.As multinationals become more skillful at managing their intellectual property, there are tax as well as commercial advantages. By holding brands and patents in low-tax countries and charging other subsidiaries for their use, profits are lowered in high-tax countries.Unsurprisingly, these shifts of intellectual capital are unpopular with many tax authorities. Two years ago, Mark Everson, former commissioner of the US Internal Revenue Service, warned that the increasing transfer of intangibles was a “high-risk compliance concern”, adding: “Taxpayers, especially in the high technology and pharmaceutical industries, are shifting profits offshore.”The small, low-tax countries that encourage profit-shifting of this sort are also criticised. Ireland’s success at attracting knowledge-based companies is seen as overly aggressive by some rival governments. Arnauld Montebourg, a French politician, last year accused low-tax Switzerland of “predatory practices”. The Netherlands – which attracted Ikea from Sweden and Gucci from Italy – was lambasted for its approach to taxing mobile income by the Amsterdam-based Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations, a non-profit research group. “All the empirical evidence indicates that the Netherlands is a tax haven,” it said.These criticisms are shrugged off by tax competition advocates, who believe tax competitiveness encourages investment. But resentment from larger rivals poses risks for small countries eager for foreign business. One of the worst fears of Ireland’s politicians is that the republic will be arm-twisted into adopting the European Commission’s proposals for a common method of computing corporate taxes. When Christine Lagarde, French finance minister, said last month that France would push this concept forward in its European Union presidency, Bertie Ahern, the outgoing Irish prime minister, dismissed it as a “daft” idea.Big countries are meanwhile strengthening their defences. In the US, the IRS is fighting the migration of intellectual property, inflicting tax demands running into billions of dollars on pharmaceutical companies. Germany has just reinforced its rules on the transfer of assets to foreign companies. The UK has proposed tightening its anti-avoidance rules by taxing the worldwide “passive” income of companies with UK headquarters.But the problem is that these tougher regimes impose a hefty compliance burden on companies and expose them to the risk of double taxation. In the UK, the complexities of the proposed anti-avoidance system have exasperated big businesses already disenchanted with Britain’s tax regime. Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, the British employers’ federation, says companies “are seriously concerned about the high level and rising complexity of taxation in the UK and are increasingly prepared to vote with their feet”.Shire said it was leaving to “help protect the group’s tax position”. UBM said its long-term interests would be helped by Ireland’s “less complex system of taxation”. But nobody can confidently predict whether this trickle will become a flood. There are some powerful factors that deter companies from migrating, including the prospect of capital gains tax bills and the threat of reputational damage.Also, for all the criticism of Britain’s tax regime, it has an enduring appeal for some multinationals because of its generous treatment of interest costs and payments to shareholders. Barclays, Britain’s third-largest bank, thought hard about moving its tax domicile when it tried to acquire ABN Amro last year but calculated that its shareholders would be better off if it stayed in Britain.Nonetheless, more big companies are considering leaving the UK. International Power, WPP, AstraZeneca and GSK have all hinted that the matter is under review. A few years ago, this could have been viewed as sabre-rattling. But a big barrier to migration has recently been lifted: companies are no longer required to have a UK base to be included in the FTSE index.Nor can the government rely on exit taxes to stem the tide. Unlike the US, which has tried to devise laws to keep companies on American soil, European governments are under pressure to remove barriers to movement within the single market.In Britain, the threat of an exodus has sparked a debate about how policymakers should respond. Insurers are lobbying the Treasury for concessions to stem migrations to Bermuda. Deloitte, the professional services company, has argued for a special tax rate on mobile income such as trademarks. Another radical option being discussed is imposing a minimum tax for multinationals on their UK profits, as an alternative to stringent anti-avoidance measures.The Treasury has an awkward dilemma. It depends on corporate taxpayers for a tenth of its revenue. It does not want to make overly generous concessions. Nor does it wish to single out specific sectors or types of income for concessions, which might create new loopholes for avoidance.So far, the Treasury’s focus has been on making the tax regime more attractive for multinationals by exempting foreign profits from tax. This move could help stop corporate migrations, were it not accompanied by tougher anti-avoidance rules. One of the main reasons why DaimlerChrysler based itself in Germany rather than the US after its 1998 merger (subsequently unwound) was that Germany exempted foreign profits from tax.The UK has also promised to cut the corporation tax further, following a 2 percentage point fall to 28 per cent this year. Gordon Brown last week told business leaders that one of his aims as prime minister was “to reduce corporation tax even further when we can afford to do so”. Some businesses are clamouring for radical cuts. A recent CBI taskforce called for the corporation tax rate to fall, over time, to 18 per cent.A view sometimes aired in government is that large countries such as the UK should be more sanguine about losing the headquarters of big domestic businesses and focus on attracting “real business” into the country, regardless of who owns or controls it. Genuine investment goes to countries where it can be deployed. Tax is far less important in these considerations than proximity to markets, infrastructure and the availability of skilled staff.Yet if countries such as Britain become reconciled to losing headquarters to lower-tax rivals, they will pay a price. As well as shedding well-paid jobs and advisory work, they risk a decline in influence and investment as decision-makers go elsewhere. When world-leading businesses uproot themselves, more is at stake than national pride.

264;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-04-27T18:01:53Z;Game on for comic ‘Iron Man’ faces big screen test;;Robert Downey Jr takes on Niko this week as Hollywood and the video-games industry fight an unprecedented battle for spending on entertainment.In one corner is Niko, the anti-hero of Grand Theft Auto IV, the latest instalment in the blockbuster video-game franchise that could break industry records when it is released on Tuesday.In the other corner is Downey in Iron Man, a comic-book adaptation expected to become Hollywood’s first big summer hit when it opens on Friday.The contest has reignited the argument over whether video games have gained ascendancy with consumers over films.John Riccitiello, chief executive of Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video-games publisher that has bid $2bn for Take Two, publisher of GTA IV, says movie executives have told him they fear the game could “kill” Iron Man. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard of that before,” he says. “There’s a big reset happening now.”Yet, hopes are high in Hollywood that Iron Man could score one of the biggest May openings, regardless of the success of GTA IV. “The forecasts range [from] $50m to $100m for its opening weekend,” says Paul Dergara­bedian, chief executive of Media by Numbers, which tracks the box office performance of films.Moreover, Mr Dergarabedian thinks the release of GTA IV could help the performance of Iron Man, because “gamers buying GTA IV are going to be talking about the game and they’re going to be talking about the movies and the movie they will be talking about is Iron Man”.Geoff Ammer, president of worldwide marketing and home entertainment for Marvel Studios, says the company appreciates “EA’s enthusiasm” for the release of GTA IV. “The two properties can co-exist in the marketplace,” he says. “We believe that moviegoers will make going to see Iron Man part of their weekend plans.”Grand Theft Auto is the biggest franchise in the games industry and its latest version could sell 6m units in its first week, according to Edward Woo, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities.The figures would eclipse last year’s release of Halo 3 by Microsoft and at $60 a game and $90 for a special edition, revenues of close to $400m are expected in the first few days.“In entertainment dollars, that means less money for people to go and watch a movie,” Mr Woo says.
265;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-04-24T02:21:37Z;Thames Valley: Pinewood project seeks to develop media cluster;;The area trisected by the M3, M4 and M40 motorways has long been known colloquially as “Europe’s silicon valley”. Gina Fegan, chief executive of the South East Media Network, a business consortium that supports the region’s digital content companies, points out that its reputation depends on three industries.These are the long-established computer companies – most of the leaders have offices in the area – video games developers and publishers such as Rebellion and Fuse Games, Electronic Arts and Lionhead Studios and the film business represented by Pinewood studios.This year, the management of the Pinewood group will submit to the Buckinghamshire planning authorities an ambitious scheme that could bring the three industries together at the heart of the Thames Valley’s creative complex and which could catapult the UK to the forefront of digital entertainment worldwide. The creative industries as a whole already contribute about 7 per cent of the UK’s gross domestic product.The scheme is called “Project Pinewood”, a multi-million pound plan to create, on some 105 acres of studio land, an industrial “cluster” analogous to the science parks of Oxford or Cambridge but centred around the creative industries – film, television and, eventually, video games.The most spectacular and picturesque aspect of the scheme will be the creation of more than two dozen film locations, permanent, full-scale sets based on the world’s most popular destinations for film makers – the streets of Manhattan, a mediaeval castle, a London street market, the boulevards of Paris. Ivan Dunleavy, Pinewood chief executive, calls them “streetscapes”.He says the project will be unique in the creative industries, certainly in Europe, possibly worldwide: a combination of advanced studio facilities with housing for the staff who work there that will result in a “living and working film and television community”.He says there were several reasons behind the genesis of Project Pinewood. Perhaps most important is the fact that the UK lacks a creative cluster of the kind Pinewood aims to seed.There are, of course, pockets of skill and expertise. London’s Soho, for example, is still a centre for film and for the post-production industries but the way electronic media destroy barriers of time and space is breaking down the traditional structure of the industry.Moreover, Soho buildings are poorly suited to electronics while Pinewood has the space and power needed to house armies of digital animators and their computers – along with the server “farms” which run day and night to create computer-generated imagery.A principal aim is to cut the cost of production for the UK’s film-makers. Mr Dunleavy explains that film and television companies currently spend large amounts of time and money filming on location around the world, often using the same spots time after time. The streetscapes available at Pinewood will make it possible for directors to move quickly and economically from one location to another. The plan is to create up to 20 different “zones” that will not only be identical to the original locations but will permit multiple shooting angles.The buildings featured in the streetscapes will be essentially mock-ups, but behind the facades will be solid, permanent buildings, comprising some 2,000 residential units complete with creches, healthcare and training facilities for the technicians and media specialists who will form the Pinewood community. Mr Dunleavy says the housing will be open to all but that it would make sense for it to be occupied by Pinewood workers.The site already provides more than 1,000 permanent jobs and the new development is expected to create more than 500 new jobs with over 1,600 jobs when the site is at full capacity.According to the developers: “For the period of development it is expected that there will be up to 950 construction jobs each year. Project Pinewood will also provide facilities for apprenticeships and training and it has been estimated that there will be around 1,300 secondary jobs created through the local economic impact”.The presence of all these dramatic, photogenic streetscapes in the heart of the English countryside suggests that tourism could benefit: but not a bit of it. The developers note frostily: “It is not a theme park. It will be a living and working high-tech community and destination designed for top-quality location filming”.
266;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-04-13T17:13:19Z;Gamesmaster makes a play for place in history;;"John Riccitiello has just come out of a meeting with film executives that has not gone according to the script.“The buzz in Hollywood, which I heard from some Hollywood folks …is people are worried whether Iron Man the movie is going to get killed by Grand Theft Auto the game,” says the chief executive of Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video game publisher.“I don’t think I’ve ever heard of that before.”The 48-year-old believes this reversal of fortunes represents a big change rather than a blip: “There is more interest today from Hollywood to make movies out of our games than there is interest in our industry to make games out of their movies. There’s a big reset happening now.”It is this emerging primacy of video games that has tempted him to a take a top job at EA for a second time in 10 years.He was president and chief operating officer from 1997 to 2004, then took a break with a private equity fund for three years, before rejoining the games company in April last year as chief executive.One year on, he is convinced he made the right decision. Sitting in a conference room at EA’s Silicon Valley headquarters, the Berkeley science graduate who was raised in California is casually dressed and relaxed. But on the subject of the industry he becomes passionate and animated.“The rate of change in this industry is massive,” he enthuses.“The games industry 10 years ago was a toy business in the minds of most consumers. Toys ‘R’ Us at the time merchandised products alphabetically so Monsters toys were next to Madden [NFL football games], Barbies were next to boxing games.”Today, probably more than 2bn people worldwide are game players, he says. Electronic games have become as ubiquitous as television and bigger than the movies.Their popularity is fuelled by a proliferation of devices that can play games – from mobile phones to iPods and handheld consoles – and advances in the performance of graphics and microprocessor chips that enhance realism and interaction.“We’ve had to wait for Moore’s Law to capitalise on itself for decades …so we’re finally able to do this stuff,” he says, referring to the steady doubling of transistors on chips every 18 months.“It feels like what movie moguls might have seen in the 1920s and said: ‘Hey, we’ve got talkies now, where is it going?’ I feel like we’ve stepped through a time window where our games are so compelling and seem so real.”It will not be long, he believes, before games are ranked as an art form alongside cinema.“Our industry is passing through a phase where I believe the greatest games will be viewed by almost everybody as being as important as Best Picture at the Academy Awards.”If so, he would nominate Grand Theft Auto IV as the most successful game of 2008 and possibly the current generation of consoles. The game, released by the publisher Take-Two and its studio Rockstar Games on April 29, is expected by analysts to sell about 10m units in the first few months.GTA IV and its Rockstar creator are the primary reason for the audacious $2bn takeover bid for Take-Two that Mr Riccitiello launched in February. The EA chief believes his $26-a-share offer, giving a 60 per cent premium on Take-Two’s share price, was generous. Take-Two has rejected it as opportunistic and undervaluing the company.He envisages the fiercely independent Rockstar fitting into the semi-autonomous studio system he has established at EA over the past year. It is a system he describes as “city state-style independence”. This studio structure stems from his experience with Elevation Partners, the private equity firm he moved to in Redwood Shores.While at Elevation, he bought and ran the studios Pandemic and BioWare (he is an avid player of BioWare’s successful role-playing game Mass Effect). In fact, he liked the studios so much he bought them twice, paying about $860m last October to bring them into the EA fold.“I spent three years outside EA managing independent developers, while EA ran a global monolithic studio organisation. I thought central command and control homogenisation had run its course.”Studios such as Criterion in the UK, which had been renamed EA UK, have now reverted back to their original names. “Allowing people to put their name on the front of a product allows them more of a sense of ownership and increases their passion,” he explains.The company had also become too big to manage, hence his division of EA last June into four “labels” for its sports titles, the Sims brand, emerging casual games and EA Games, which covers the rest of its titles.Mr Riccitiello has given EA a much needed shake-up. Under the 16-year tenure of his predecessor, Larry Probst, the company had grown from sales of $102m in 1991 to $3bn in revenues last year, and achieved undisputed leadership among pure-play publishers.But the company did not handle the transition to next-generation consoles well, being slow to see the potential of Nintendo’s Wii. The quality of its games also slipped and it lost market share in 2007 as hits dried up.Buying Take-Two would give EA the hit stables of Rockstar and another studio, 2K Games, but Mr Riccitiello says: “I don’t think you ever want to buy to fix a problem.“EA’s product line-up in 2008 is the best it’s ever been; it’s a truly spectacular line-up and we’re going to see strong share growth,” he says, citing games such as Spore, the new title from Will Wright, creator of The Sims, and Boom Blox, the first game developed with the director Steven Spielberg.A Take-Two acquisition would also be likely to confirm EA’s number-one status, due to be challenged by Activision Blizzard, as the merger of rival US publisher Activision with the games division of Vivendi is completed.Mr Riccitiello says being number one has never been his priority.“Above all, I’m trying to bring great quality and innovation back …I’m also trying to drive us towards a variety of new business models, whether it be subscription or micro-transactions, or advertising-based,” he saysHowever, he admits to wanting to cement the 26-year-old company’s place in history. “I read a book on how every medium creates one great company: animation created Disney, CBS was created by radio, NBC by television.“Interactive entertainment is going to determine one great company and I think it’s this one. One of the reasons I’ve come back is to try to take it to the next step.”Personal passion smooths transition for consumer goods manJohn Riccitiello believes his passion for video games and technology has been vital to his success in an industry where those with consumer goods backgrounds often struggle.The 48-year-old has focused for the past 11 years on video games, but spent the previous 17 in consumer goods where he learnt marketing, sales and finance and how to manage teams. He joined EA from Sara Lee, where he was head of its worldwide bakery division. Before that, he was chief executive of Wilson Sporting Goods and held executive positions at Haagen-Dazs, PepsiCo and the Clorox Company.“But throughout I had this personal passion . . . I bought the earliest Apple products, built lasers and holograms in high school. I played the original Doom and Mortal Kombat.“So the reason I was twice able to be quoted that this was my dream job – once when I came back and once a decade earlier – is that it was one of those rare circumstances where I was able to unite something I had a personal passion for together with where I could make a difference. Passion really matters in the entertainment business.”"
267;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-04-11T20:51:42Z;Wiiware’s Cool Games for Attractive People;;Humour and ingenious gameplay are giving small independent game developers a fighting chance against the big-budget efforts of the major video game publishers.At least that was the impression left by Nintendo’s Wiiware demonstration for the gaming press in San Francisco today.Wiiware is a new downloadable game service for the Wii, similar to Microsoft’s Xbox Live Arcade service. It was launched last month in Japan and arrives in the US on May 12. There is no date yet for Europe.Gamers can buy the games with Wii points and small developers benefit from not having the prohibitive costs of packaging, marketing and distribution to retail stores.Nintendo said today that start-ups like San Francisco’s 2D Boy were the quintessential indie developers that Wiiware was designed for.Kyle Gabler and Ron Carmel left Electronic Arts to start the company and still work out of local coffee shops.They have come up with a physics puzzle/construction game called World of Goo, where Goo balls can be linked together to create towers and bridges and complete tasks.The Goo balls have zippy, optimistic, endlessly striving personalities and are unaware of the unhappy destination they are heading for at the World of Goo Corporation.“The game is a metaphor for the horrible interactions we have had with publishers so far,” Kyle told us.A second presentation was made by Telltale Games, a four-year-old company started by two LucasArts veterans in its old base of San Rafael in the Bay Area.Its Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People is the first episodic content for Wiiware. The game is based on the very funny Strong Bad character and others created by online animators Matt and Mike Chapman at Homestarrunner.com.Five monthly episodes will be released containing dialogue-based puzzles and lots of retro mini-games such as Snake Boxer 5, where a low-polygon-count boxer punches a snake.Wiiware seems to encourage a level playing field for developers. Looking around the demo room later, the indie games’ simple graphics matched up well with some surprisingly rudimentary ones from bigger publishers, in particular, Boom Blox, the first game to come out of Electronic Arts’ collaboration with the movie director Steven Spielberg.It’s all “in the game” play, to paraphrase EA’s catchphrase.
268;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-04-07T19:57:25Z;THQ says it won’t be left behind;;The video game publisher THQ must be feeling a little like WALL.E, the robot title character in the next Pixar game it plans to release in sync with the animated movie this June.WALL.E is left behind on earth to clear up the trash after all the humans have left, just as THQ faces a solitary future after the galactic mergers of Activision with Vivendi and potentially Electronic Arts with Take-Two.THQ would be left among the rubble in the US as the only other significant third-party publisher (THQ’s $1.5bn market capitalisation is six times that of the persistently underperforming Midway Games.)EA has argued that Take-Two ($1.9bn market cap) is sub-scale and unable to compete effectively in a world where truly global marketing and publishing operations are needed to maximise the revenues from hit games.By that measure, THQ is sub-scale, but it’s an argument that Brian Farrell, THQ’s chief executive, tried to refute when I met him in San Francisco last week.“The truth of the matter is that we do have scale,” he said.“We have 2,000 people in product development on three continents, we are in every market, we put out 147 Skus [versions] of Ratatouille.”“There are disadvantages to being overly large as well, we can can say: ‘Do you want to be number 30 in a bigger publisher’s roster or be in our top 10 – it’s a big argument with licensors.”Mr Farrell says THQ and France’s Ubisoft would be left in the $1bn-$2bn market-cap range if both mergers take place and everyone else would be “sub-scale”.THQ has hit a rough patch in the past few months. In January, it said games, including Stuntman and Ratatouille had underperformed, other games were being cancelled and its Concrete Games studio was being shut down.“We have a very disciplined review process, [Concrete Games] wasn’t making progress and we had to make a tough call. It’s probably the first studio we’ve closed, but it’s all about talent and the management of that talent,” said Mr Farrell.He has positioned two experienced executives to monitor production values and processes and is upbeat about the new games that reviewers were let loose on at a San Francisco event.I had fun with Red Faction:Guerrilla, a game that allows you to demolish a building piece by piece with a hammer, and de Blob, a Nintendo Wii game where you can literally paint the town red. Saints Row 2, due in August, also looked impressive and Pixar’s WALL.E may well sell better than its Ratatouille. Making an engaging game about a rat that likes cooking was a tough one, Mr Farrell admitted.
269;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-03-28T19:38:44Z;Electronic Arts turns heat up on Take-Two;;Electronic Arts on Friday took a tougher line with its $2bn takeover target Take-Two, warning a poison pill introduced by the board of the rival video game publisher was increasing the risk for its shareholders.EA said it was amending its tender offer for Take-Two shares in the light of the adoption of the poison pill this week and Take-Two postponing its annual meeting by a week.It said its offer was now conditional on the poison pill – a rights issue that would dilute Take-Two’s shares – being redeemed or made invalid. It also extended its $26-a-share offer by a week to April 18, the day after the annual meeting. “The actions of the Take-Two board may increase the risk for their stockholders by delaying a potential transaction,” said Owen Mahoney, head of corporate development at EA.EA also revealed that only 5,000 of Take-Two’s 74m shares have been tendered since the offer was made on March 13.Analysts said the derisory number was not significant.“People will wait, they have already showed their willingness to go higher [from $25 to $26],” said Brent Thill, Citigroup analyst.Take-Two shares have risen nearly 50 per cent since EA’s offer became public on February 24.Mr Thill said he believed the steps being taken by the two companies were ploys that would lead to negotiations where they would “meet somewhere in the middle” on a higher valuation.However, Michael Pachter, analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities, warned there was a real chance EA could abandon the possible deal, and the fact that EA had not been building a significant stake in Take-Two was an indication it would be willing to walk away.
270;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;EA urges Take-Two to negotiate;;Electronic Arts has again urged Take-Two to negotiate after the rival video game publisher recommended that its stockholders not tender any of its shares to EA and help its $2bn takeover bid.Take-Two said on Wednesday that its board had thoroughly reviewed EA’s $26-a-share offer for the company and had unanimously determined that it was inadequate.It said it would explore alternatives, which could include a merger with other companies or remaining independent.The company had wanted to put off any discussions until after the April 29 release of its Grand Theft Auto IV game, a title expected to be the industry hit of the year.But on Wednesday, Take-Two said it was willing to begin preliminary talks now with interested parties.The board also adopted a “poison pill” rights-issue agreement designed to thwart attempts to acquire control of the company at “an inadequate price for all stockholders”.Take-Two said the rights would become exercisable if a party commenced a tender offer, as EA has done, that could result in the party owning 20 per cent or more of the shares.John Riccitiello, EA chief executive, told the Financial Times that he did not blame Take-Two’s management for trying to get the best value for shareholders.But he added: “When a company [like EA] offers a 60 per cent premium that’s really hard to say no to. How I think is: unless you’ve got a really good way to get that much money or more in really quick order, you should be really negotiating to get the best outcome.”
271;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-03-27T01:21:46Z;Games industry chases tax deals to halt exodus;;Britain’s games industry is intensifying calls for the government to grant tax breaks to help prevent a brain drain to Canada after SCi, the UK’s largest games publisher, became the latest company to shift production across the Atlantic.Earlier this month SCi, owner of the Lara Croft Tomb Raider franchise, announced plans to cut 25 per cent of staff, mostly in the UK, while increasing investment in Canada.“The UK has become a very expensive place to develop games,” said Ian Livingstone, creative director at SCi. “ Look at the top 20 best-selling games – not one of them is being developed in the UK.”Unhappiness over the country’s games environment comes as the sector braces itself for potential criticism in a government report out on Thursday on the effect of computer games and the internet on children.The games sector often comes under fire for the violent content of some of its output and for encouraging children to adopt a sedentary lifestyle, adding to a sense that the government does not value the industry.“We make the UK economy a small fortune but are still treated as pariahs,” said Ian Baverstock, chief executive of Kuju, one of the UK’s larger developers. “Why they go on giving tax breaks to the film industry but not to us, I don’t understand.”SCi is the latest company to join the UK exodus, which has seen US publishers Electronic Arts and Take Two move their European headquarters out of the country. Only one of SCi’s four key games franchises – Championship Manager – is still developed in the UK.Championship Manager employs about 50 people in Britain, compared with new development studios re-cently opened in Montreal, which are expected to have staff of 350.EA recently consolidated its remaining studios in the UK into a single building, and has about 450 development staff in the country, compared with more than 1,000 in Canada.Many companies have been rushing to locate new projects in Canada, where regional governments are offering games companies lucrative tax deals. Companies can get about 30 to 40 per cent of their wage bill refunded if they move there – one of their most substantial costs – while employees are offered income tax holidays for up to five years.The moves helped Canada overtake the UK in 2006 to become the third largest region for games development in the world.Canadian subsidies have already substantially shrunk the French games industry, where, since 2000, 45 per cent of development studios have gone out of business and an estimated 1,500 development staff have moved to Canada. The UK industry, which employs about 21,000 people and generates £2bn ($4bn) in revenues, is worried it could suffer the same fate.“The Canadians have driven a tank over the French Citroën and have now parked on our lawn,” said Peter Jackson, director-general of Elspa, the trade body for the UK’s games publishers. “It is becoming very challenging to keep core development studios here.”Ministers have been reluctant to consider subsidies, however, saying they planned instead to challenge Canada’s tax breaks through the WTO. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said it was taking steps to ask the European Commission to investigate the issue as a matter of priority.But the games industry fears this process could take too long to be of help.“In 10 years’ time we might have a ruling. At that time we will be on the fifth version of the PlayStation, and whether we will still have a games development sector in the UK will be a moot point,” said Jason Kingsley, chief executive and co-founder of Rebellion, one of the UK’s largest games developers.
272;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-03-24T23:10:05Z;Departure of EA takeover chief;;Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest independent video game publisher, has announced the departure of a key figure in its fight to gain control of rival Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series of games.EA said that Warren Jenson, chief financial officer for the past six years, was leaving the company and that a successor would be announced shortly. It gave no reason for the change.Mr Jenson had been leading the $2bn takeover bid for Take-Two with John Riccitiello, chief executive, and his departure comes as a surprise.EA said Mr Jenson would help with the transition to his replacement and would close out EA’s fiscal year, which ends next Monday.A regulatory filing re-vealed EA reached a transition agreement with Mr Jenson last week. He would continue to receive his base salary of $595,000 a year with benefits until September 30 unless he took up a new job.Mr Riccitiello has made several management changes since he succeeded Larry Probst as chief executive a year ago. He has reorganised the company into four different “labels” with separate heads and this month appointed a chief operating officer, John Pleasants, to lead the company’s global publishing operations.Mr Jenson is a high-profile CFO, having served in that position in companies as varied as Amazon.com, NBC and Delta Airlines.
273;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-03-09T21:08:16Z;Take-Two’s severance plan puts EA on notice;;Electronic Arts will be recalculating the cost and benefits of its proposed $2bn acquisition of Take-Two on Monday after the rival video game publisher announced a generous severance package for its employees.In a regulatory filing late on Friday, Take-Two said its board had approved a package for employees in the event that they lose their jobs as a result of a take-over. They would receive as much as one-and-a-half times their salary and bonus for up to 18 months.EA has already expressed its “surprise”, and analysts and corporate governance experts had raised eyebrows, at the compensation package Take-Two’s management team won for itself last month while talks with EA were being held in private.Salaries and possible bonuses were more than tripled and restricted shares were awarded worth millions of dollars. The executive team is not included in the new severance terms.Take-Two’s severance packages are similar to the change of control packages announced by Yahoo for its employees last month, a move described in one lawsuit brought against the internet company as being part of its effort to thwart Microsoft’s takeover bid by increasing the cost by at least $1bn.EA has said it sees synergies in Take-Two’s corporate and publishing organisations, meaning there would be opportunities for job cuts as EA’s more powerful publishing arm takes over distribution of the titles from Take-Two’s studios.EA prizes Rockstar Games, developer of the Grand Theft Auto title, but has been coy about its plans for 2K Sports, which duplicates many of the games offered by its EA Sports label. It has also declined to give estimates for savings it could make or for the initial costs of merging the two organisations.There has been little activity since EA went public with its takeover bid two weeks ago and Take-Two revealed it had rejected its offer of $26 a share, which was a dollar higher than an initial bid.Unless EA raises its offer further, analysts expect little to happen until the release of Grand Theft Auto IV on April 29. Take-Two’s management has said it is prepared to open talks with EA on April 30 and that EA’s rejection of this offer shows it is trying to acquire the company at a significant discount before the year’s most anticipated game is released.EA has said that Take-Two will be worth less to it if there is no early agreement that enables its stronger marketing arm to maximise sales of the game worldwide.“We don’t think time is the friend of Take-Two,” Warren Jenson, EA chief financial officer, told the Financial Times.He described the company as “sub-scale”, in an industry where scale increasingly mattered, and warned EA could walk away from the deal: “That is certainly an option, Take-Two is depreciating as an asset,” he said.Brent Thill, Citigroup analyst, said EA’s bid was part of a period of “accelerated consolidation” among video game publishers as they strived to maximise revenues from the millions of next-generation consoles now in gamers’ hands.He pointed to Activision’s $19bn combination with Vivendi’s games division, expected to be completed in the first half. “You are going to come down to two main vendors – EA and Activision Blizzard,” he says.He added that most deals made public resulted in higher bids, “and that’s what it’s going to take to get this deal done”.Ben Feder, Take-Two chief executive, defended the new compensation packages he and other top executives had been awarded. He told the FT that discussions about it had predated any indication of interest from EA.“At the end of the day, it’s all to be voted on by shareholders,” he said.Mr Feder was put in place as chief executive after major shareholders, dissatisfied with Take-Two’s financial performance, removed the old board at its annual meeting a year ago. He said he had launched a $25m cost-cutting programme, reorganised the company, made a preliminary settlement over outstanding litigation and improved its product portfolio.”I would love to see this through, most turnarounds take about 18 months and we are about 10 months into this one. It’s a work in progress, but we will do whatever the shareholders wish us to do.”
274;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-03-04T17:33:22Z;Valley view: It’s time for games to start growing up;;One of the criticisms of video games at the recent Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco was that they were still a long way from resembling real life.Verisimilitude is not the issue these days. The next-generation consoles and latest PC graphics cards have the power to reproduce lush vegetation and characters that seem to live and breathe.But the heroes of games seem more interested in blowing up and beating other players than bonding with them. Clint Hocking, a creative director with French publisher Ubisoft, asked why there were so few games where players had actual relationships with someone else, where they could feel for them and protect them.“Why isn’t Call of Duty about duty? Why isn’t Medal of Honor about honour?” he asked.These empty killing games, where the only emotion involved is an adrenalin one of nervous excitement, replace feelings and strong themes from books such as The Lord of the Rings, with hundreds of weapons and pieces of armour – “object fetishism” as Mr Hocking described it.He added that this was the difference between an immature medium and the mature art form that video games would eventually become.One wonders where the fault lies. The target audience of young hard-core gamers seems happy enough with shoot ’em ups, the developers – often in the same age range – are charged with making games for themselves, while the publishers seem only interested in reproducing variations on previous best-sellers.Perhaps there is hope in other genres, in the work of independent game developers and in the players themselves, when they are allowed to show some creativity.At an analyst day at its Silicon Valley headquarters last month, Electronic Arts demonstrated its most anticipated title, Spore.Its creator Will Wright, who also invented The Sims, showed us how players could evolve their own worlds from amoeba-like beginnings to sophisticated colonies of creatures.They will be able to upload movies of their creations to YouTube or share them in Sporepedia, a catalogue of parts and objects that will allow “pollinated content” to populate other people’s universes.Spore, which has been in development since 2000, will finally be available this year, as should Sony’s LittleBigPlanet, which was first demonstrated at GDC last year. The game lets players select the objects and physics that allow them to create events and levels in their very own version of the game. It is the first attempt by a mainstream publisher to foster “mods” and “mash-ups” of a game to this degree and Sony expects players to upload and share their versions with each other.EA also showed SimsCarnival.com at its analyst day, a site where users can play casual games but also create their own.The Scratch project of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is aimed at providing a simple programming language for children aged eight to 16 to create games. Thousands of games have been uploaded to its galleries since launch last yearMicrosoft announced at this year’s GDC that community-created games would be appearing on its Xbox Live service later this year and would double the size of its library to more than 1,000 games. This has been expected since the launch of the 360 console and its XNA software tools, designed to help hobbyists create games.“Our goal is to drive a creative and social revolution in games with the same transformative power that we’ve seen in digital music and video sharing,” says John Schappert, corporate vice-president of Xbox Live.Among the first games that will appear are Little Gamers, a high-definition action game by a 24-year-old Belgian software developer, and TriLinea, a strategy game put together by three developers in Brazil.These moves may not provide the desired injection of emotions and relationships into games, which remains a challenge, but they should lead to more personal games or ones capable of personalised experiences, making them more “real”.In the meantime, players will have to rely on a new range of peripherals to get closer to reality. At GDC, Nintendo demonstrated its Wii balance board. It resembles bathroom scales, but can not only measure weight, but also sense movement in different directions, allowing more realistic skate and snowboarding games.There was also the Epoc mind-control headset from Emotiv. This has 16 separate sensors that allow it to read brain waves, facial expressions and sense a player’s mood, allowing games to be played with the power of thought.Less cerebral, and appealing to those shoot ’em up gamers, was TN Games’ vest. Force-feedback air bladders in it can reproduce the impact of a bullet. “Get pounded with body slams, crushed with G-forces, and blasted with bullet fire,” says its developer. What could feel more real than that?
275;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-02-29T21:41:41Z;Wall St stocks slide as credit woes persist;;The sell-off on Wall Street deepened on Friday as markets digested weak economic data and further credit market woes.US stocks have now declined for a fourth consecutive month, their longest losing streak since 2002.The S&P 500 fell 1.7 per cent this week to 1,330.74. The benchmark index declined 3.5 per cent in February and has fallen 9.3 per cent this year.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.9 per cent this week to 12,266.39. The index fell 3 per cent in February.The Nasdaq composite shed 1.4 per cent this week to 2,271.48 and has declined 14.4 per cent this year.The worst consumer confidence reading in 16 years, soft economic growth data, higher jobless claims, soaring oil prices and falling home sales and house prices all contributed to the gloom.Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, sparked a sell-off in financial stocks when he said there would probably be some bank failures, and urged lenders to increase capital.An index tracking regional S&P 500 banks fell 6.2 per cent on the week, while a broader index of financial stocks fell 4.9 per cent to 6-week low.Losses incurred by a wheat trader and a suite of analyst downgrades sent MF Global 39.9 per cent lower to $17.55 this week. Ratings agencies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s lowered their credit ratings on the brokerage.Record losses at government-sponsored mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and problems at Thornburg Mortgage added to concerns about the health of the housing market.Shares in Fannie Mae, which this week reported a $3.6bn fourth-quarter loss, fell 3.7 per cent to $27.65.Smaller rival Freddie Mac posted a quarterly loss of $2.5bn and issued a bleak outlook for the year ahead.“Today’s economy represents one of the most severe housing downturns in American history,” said Richard Syron, chief executive. Shares fell 5.4 per cent to $25.18.Thornburg Mortgage, which specialises in exotic home loans, fell 17.6 per cent to $8.90 after it said it might have to sell assets to meet lenders’ demands for in-creased collateral.Credit worries intensified after AIG, the world’s largest insurer, reported a $5.3bn loss owing to $11.5bn in writedowns on derivatives. AIG’s shares fell 4.1 per cent to $46.86.UBS, which on Friday said credit-market losses at financial firms might top $600bn, said the writedown at AIG was “also the clearest indication that banks are not the only ones to suffer potential losses”.Bond insurers endured a roller-coaster week. Moody’s and S&P affirmed the triple-A ratings of Ambac and MBIA, although uncertainty surrounding the Citigroup-led plan to rescue Ambac worried investors.Ambac’s shares rose 4 per cent on the week to $11.14 and MBIA added 6.5 per cent to $12.97, despite saying it could incur claims payments amounting to a significant portion of its reserves.Assured Guaranty soared 14.4 per cent to $25.65 after Wilbur Ross agreed to buy up to $1bn in shares. Assured is less exposed to the subprime market than its larger rivals.In the broader market, RH Donnelley lost more than half its value after the Yellow Pages publisher reduced its earnings forecast and scrapped plans for a dividend. Its shares fell 59.4 per cent to $7.09.Technology and media and companies provided some light in the darkness.Take-Two Software, the video game publisher, sur-ged 43.6 per cent this week to $26.50 after it received an unsolicited $2bn offer from rival Electronic Arts. Take-Two rebuffed EA’s offer, saying it undervalued the company, and filings revealed it has since received other, informal approaches. EA’s shares fell 5 per cent this week to $47.29.Technology consulting company Sapient rose 19.2 per cent to $7.38 after it said first-quarter sales would exceed analysts’ estimates.Novell rose 12.7 per cent to $7.41 after the Linux software distributor reported fiscal first-quarter profits that beat estimates.3Com leapt 15.8 per cent to $3.29 after the Wall Street Journal said Bain Capital and Huawei Technologies planned to reapply for ap-proval to buy the networking systems and services provider in a $2.2bn deal.OmniVision Technologies, which makes image sensors, jumped 26.5 per cent to $15.86 after its earnings surpassed estimates.But Sprint Nextel slid 20.2 per cent to $7.11 after the third-biggest US wireless carrier posted a $29.5bn net loss for the fourth quarter.
276;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-02-25T23:59:01Z;EA seeks mature partner for fun and games;;One interesting comment from this morning’s Electronic Arts conference call on its proposed take-out of Take-Two was on the subject of games for grown-ups.“EA is notably underrepresented in M-rated [Mature audience] content, this gives us additional M-rated content, in fact it gives us the world’s best M-rated content,” said John Riccitiello, chief executive.EA has focused on family fare, from its sports franchises to its Sims division and Harry Potter games, so one wonders whether it might water down and take some of the appeal away from Take-Two’s edgier titles.In case you need reminding, Take-Two has appeared to actively court controversy at times to hype its games.Manhunt 2, for example, was banned in Britain last year for its “unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone “. It was given an initial Adults Only [18+] rating in the US rather than a Mature [17+] one.Bully ran into trouble in Florida in 2006 when an anti-video-game-violence attorney Jack Thompson applied for a court ban on the playground bullying game.Before that, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was taken off store shelves in the US in 2005 after a hidden sex scene was discovered.Mr Riccitiello seems keen to take EA in this new direction, if not to the same extremes.At this month’s analyst day, he talked up the merits of Dead Space, an EA entry in the sci-fi horror genre being developed at its Redwood Shores headquarters and due for release later this year.Before then, he could turn the struggle for Take-Two into an M-rated contest itself if its management continues to resist the so-far friendly overtures.
277;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-02-25T23:23:48Z;EA races against clock in $2bn merger;;"Electronic Arts on Monday warned rival video game publisher Take-Two that “time was of the essence” and there was no certainty any other buyer would emerge to top its $2bn takeover offer for the owner of the Grand Theft Auto franchise.“Our preference is to make this a friendly transaction, we are hopeful we can achieve that,” John Riccitiello, EA chief executive, said on Monday.Take-Two’s shares rose 52 per cent from Friday’s close to $26.40 on Monday, following EA’s disclosure on Sunday that it had made a $26 a share offer for the company a week ago. Take-Two’s board had rejected it as “inadequate” on Friday.The world’s biggest independent video games publisher warned that the value of the deal to EA would dissipate if it could not be completed soon.EA is keen to finalise a deal in time for the launch by Take-Two of Grand Theft Auto IV on April 29. This would give its global publishing and distribution business time to boost sales of the most anticipated title of the year in the industry.“We would sell more of it; we have subsidiaries in places that, given their scale, I don’t think they’ve ever visited,” Mr Riccitiello said.However, Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities, argues the real reason behind EA’s need to complete a takeover bid quickly is the strength of Take-Two’s 2K sports game franchises.While EA leads in sports games sales with titles such as Madden NFL, Take-Two’s 2K titles have earned better reviews in some cases for their more innovative game-play.“The real urgency in getting this deal done is the launch of basketball games in the autumn. It doesn’t make sense to market two of them: they want to eliminate the competition in sports,” he told the Financial Times.The acquisition of Take-Two, and what is expected to be the best-selling game of the year, would be expected to keep EA as the number one publisher, a position threatened in December when the merger between Activision and Vivendi’s games unit was announced.The two sides said the $18.9bn merger would make the new company, Activision Blizzard, “the world’s largest, most profitable, pure-play video game publisher” with about $3.8bn in combined revenues in the 2007 calendar year.The merger is expected to be completed in the first half but a combination of EA and Take-Two is expected to have about $4.8bn in revenues in their 2008 fiscal years.The Activision/Vivendi deal was seen as auguring a period of consolidation in the industry, but at the time EA denied any connection with its reopening of takeover discussions with Take-Two.“We’ve been in an on-and-off dialogue for a year,” Warren Jenson, chief financial officer, told the FT.Mr Riccitiello said he opened talks last March as the newly appointed chief executive, but called them off to turn his attention to reorganising EA into four new divisions or “labels”.He completed the company restructuring in November and reopened discussions with Take-Two’s management in December.Mr Riccitiello expressed surprise at a much-improved compensation package Take-Two’s board awarded to the management team this month after rejecting EA’s initial $25 a share offer.Analysts also voiced concern on Monday at how the lucrative employment terms for the heads of Rockstar Games, the developer of Grand Theft Auto, would fit in with EA’s compensation schemes and whether the group could retain such talent.“It’s not going to get cheaper to work with these guys,” said Mr Riccitiello, who noted that the developer had survived six CEO transitions in five years. “We see them as the asset, the key part of the deal within RockStar, we have great respect for them and expect them to stick around,” he added."
278;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-02-25T21:43:47Z;Wall St rallies as monolines retain rating;;US stocks staged their biggest rally this month after rating agency Standard & Poor’s reaffirmed the triple-A ratings of troubled bond insurers Ambac and MBIA.The Dow closed 1.5 per cent higher at 12,570.62, the Nasdaq ended up 1.1 per cent at 2,327.48 and the S&P 500 closed up 1.4 per cent at 1,371.41.S&P also removed MBIA from CreditWatch, meaning it is no longer at imminent risk of losing its top-notch rating. Shares in the bond insurer soared 19.7 per cent to close at $14.58.But S&P said Ambac‘s triple-A rating was still at risk because of the uncertainty surrounding its plans to raise fresh capital. Ambac’s shares closed 15.9 per cent higher at $12.41.Strong performances from energy, industrial and pharmaceutical stocks supported the broad-based rally.Alcoa enjoyed the biggest gain among components of the Dow industrial average. Shares in the aluminium company closed up 6.3 per cent at $38.85 after the European Commission cleared the proposal by New Zealand’s Rank Group to buy Alcoa’s packaging and consumer business for $2.7bn.Other aluminium makers also rallied. Century Aluminium reached an all-time high of $68.58, up 4.5 per cent on the day, and Kaiser Aluminium climbed 3.1 per cent to $75.56Energy stocks benefited from oil’s steady climb back towards $100 a barrel.Exxon Mobil rose 2.3 per cent to $89.13. Chevron rose 2.1 per cent to $87.23.Gulfmark Offshore, another beneficiary of strong oil prices, rose 13.3 per cent to $51.50 after reporting forecast-beating fourth-quarter profits. The group transports drilling materials and supplies to offshore oil facilities.In pharmaceuticals, GTx rose 36 per cent to $17.95 after the group said its experimental drug reduced the side effects of prostate cancer therapy in a trial.Lowe’s rose 3.4 per cent to $24.40, reversing earlier losses after analysts endorsed the group’s updated 2008 guidance.Brian Nagel, UBS analyst, said he was “encouraged” that management was “incorporating a more realistic market view into guidance and slowing square footage growth”.Lowe’s, the world’s second-largest home improvement retailer, had reported a fall in fourth-quarter profit and forecast “challenging” quarters ahead.Sentiment was also lifted by mergers and acquisitions activity and news of a potentially record-breaking initial public offering by Visa, which intends to raise up to $18.8bn.Video game publisher Take-Two, which has rebuffed an unsolicited $2bn bid from rival Electronic Arts, posted its biggest-ever gain, soaring 54.9 per cent to $26.89. Take-Two publishes the blockbuster video game series Grand Theft Auto. Electronic Arts fell 5.2 per cent to $47.14 on speculation it would raise its bid.Takeover talks also boosted Getty Images. Getty, the world’s largest provider of photographs to publications and advertising agencies, agreed to be bought by private equity group Hellman & Friedman for $2.1bn. Shares rose 29.6 per cent to $31.69Warner Music Group jumped 13.6 per cent to $6.43 after the record company said it had promoted Michael Nash to executive vice-president of strategy and business development.“I don’t trust today’s rally,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards. “The dominant trend of our market is still lower.”Among the losers, Citigroup fell 1.4 per cent to $24.76 after Oppenheimer analysts led by Meredith Whitney said credit losses would limit full-year profits at the US bank.Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Washington Mutual to “sell” from “neutral”, citing expectations that mortgage losses would continue to increase as house prices extended declines.Freddie Mac tumbled 1.9 per cent to $26.11 and Fannie Mae fell 1.9 per cent to $28.18. Washington Mutual pared earlier losses to close up 1 per cent at $17.07.General Motors recovered from being cut to “hold” from “buy” by Deutsche Bank, closing up 0.5 per cent at $24.20.“We’ve grown increasingly concerned that the cyclical downturn [in North America] could be deeper and more protracted than previously expected,’’ Deutsche analyst Rod Lache said.
279;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-02-25T19:45:48Z;Video games M&A;;Has John Riccitiello, chief executive of Electronic Arts, been taking lessons from Steve Ballmer?The Microsoft chief’s bear hug on Yahoo bucked the tech sector’s tradition of friendly mergers. Now EA is taking a similar approach with games publisher Take Two Interactive Software. First came the private exchange of letters. Having been rejected, EA has gone public. Its latest missive even echoes Microsoft’s passive aggressive style, thanking Take Two for its “courteous tone” before putting the screws on the management to agree a deal.Like Microsoft in software, EA is used to being top dog in the video games world. Having long relied on a stable of big sports and movie tie-ins, however, it has to expand its offering, particularly in action and role-playing games. Meanwhile, competitors are bulking up. Activision recently agreed a merger with Vivendi’s games business.Buying Take Two at $26 a share would be a quick way for EA to acquire, rather than develop, an established games brand – in this case, the Grand Theft Auto series. EA’s argument that scale counts is strong. Its direct distribution network is powerful, particularly outside the US. Extra resources should help increase the frequency with which Take Two’s best titles are updated.The big risk EA faces, as does Microsoft, is a culture clash. Rockstar Games, Take Two’s big in-house development studio, is the brains behind GTA. Keeping its programmers happy is crucial to the success of any deal. In this, EA’s task looks easier than Microsoft’s. Incorporating another studio into the existing stable should not involve too much upheaval.But EA may have a fight on its hands. A 50 per cent premium is attractive but, at 18 times forward earnings, it is no home run. Unlike Yahoo, which still trades below Microsoft’s offer, Take Two has already leapt ahead of EA’s bid.Post and read comments on this Lex
280;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-02-25T01:32:27Z;EA in $2bn takeover bid for Take-Two;;Electronic Arts has launched a takeover bid that would enable it to retain its position as the world’s biggest independent video game publisher.EA is offering $2bn cash for Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series of games. Take-Two on Sunday night rejected the offer, saying the proposal “substantially undervalues” the company.The board has already rejected two unsolicited private bids from EA this month. This forced EA out into the open on Sunday to bring its proposal “to the attention of all Take-Two shareholders”.EA and Take-Two had combined revenues of $4.1bn in the 2007 fiscal year, meaning that a merger would be likely to give EA the edge over the expected combination of Activision and Vivendi’s games division in the first half of this year.The $18.9bn merger of Activision and Vivendi to create Activision Blizzard, “the world’s largest, most profitable pure-play video game publisher” was announced in December, with the two companies having about $3.8bn in combined revenues in the 2007 calendar year.Besides its desire to trump its biggest rival Activision, EA’s offer letter to Take-Two revealed that it coveted its best-selling Grand Theft Auto franchise, with the latest instalment, Grand Theft Auto IV, due for global release on April 29. John Riccitiello, EA chief executive, said he wanted to close the transaction quickly so that EA’s strong publishing and distribution network “can positively impact the catalogue sales of GTA IV”.Mr Riccitiello formally offered $25 per share in cash for Take-Two in a letter to Strauss Zelnick, chairman of the board, on February 6, after talks by the two sides.Mr Zelnick replied on February 15 that the board was open to discussing a business combination “at the right time and the right price”, but EA’s proposal met neither criteria.The EA chief raised his offer to $26 per share last Tuesday, a 64 per cent premium over Take-Two’s closing price a week ago, valuing the company at about $2bn.He threatened to make the offer public if the Take-Two board was not willing to negotiate and did so after Mr Zelnick rejected the new offer in a letter on Friday.In a statement on Sunday, Mr Zelnick said Take-Two had been willing to enter discussions with EA on April 30, a day after Grand Theft Auto IV’s release.“We believe EA’s offer is highly opportunistic and is attempting to take advantage of our upcoming release of Grand Theft Auto IV, one of the most valuable and durable franchises in the industry,” he said.
281;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-02-13T23:30:00Z;Spore already spawning spin-offs;;Spore, the game that has been spawning cell-like in Will Wright’s imagination since 2000, was born as a fully-formed franchise idea.At the Electronic Arts analyst day yesterday, the creator of The Sims showed off the eagerly awaited title and detailed numerous commercial spin-offs.The Sims itself was not thought of as a franchise originally, he told us, with sales initially only expected to be in the hundreds of thousands.But 98m units later, The Sims is not just a franchise but a whole division, one of four “labels” that now constitute EA.Plans for this year include Simanimals, the expansion of MySims on the Nintendo Wii, a Sims movie, Simsonstage.com offering karaoke user contributions and SimsCarnival.com, a casual games site.Mr Wright said Spore was conceived as a franchise from the start and deals have already been worked out with the likes of National Geographic, Comic Book Creator and Zazzle.Spore is a game about evolution, with users creating creatures and moving on to shape entire planets. EA plans to release its Creature Creator software ahead of the game’s launch in September so that players can get a headstart on the life forms that will populate their individual worlds. Its Sporepedia will be a catalogue of parts and objects that can be acquired from both EA developers and user-creators – “pollinated content” that can populate other people’s universes.Wright and his Maxis team, based in Emeryville in the Bay Area, seem to have caught the social networking bug as well. Players will have their own profile pages and can share movies of their worlds and inhabitants, with easy uploads to YouTube.The demonstration made the personalisation available in The Sims look very Sim-plistic, while the creation tools seemed a major advance in ease-of-use compared to those of Second Life.
282;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
283;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-02-12T23:27:00Z;EA chief is his own worst critic;;John Riccitiello did not mince his words about the performance of Electronic Arts over the past year.“This outright pisses me off,” said the chief executive at EA’s analyst day today, referring to a graph showing a three percentage point loss in market share in 2007.He said he was even more annoyed by the downward trend in the quality of EA games – the average rating per title supplied by Metacritic has fallen from 77 to 72 over the past five years.The company also bet on the wrong horse in the next-generation console stakes – favouring development for the PlayStation 3 first, which proved problematic, over the Xbox 360 and lastly the Wii. Wrong call, he said, as was the overinvestment in its Renderware middleware that caused slippages.And then there was the bloating of headcount by 3,000 in three years and development costs increasing to the extent that they were the equivalent of nearly a third of revenues.Three major franchises also disappointed with sub-standard iterations causing slumps in sales for the Need for Speed racing game, NBA basketball and Harry Potter.Of course, it’s easier for Mr Riccitiello as an incoming CEO – he succeeded Larry Probst a year ago – to admit the company has made mistakes and wipe the slate clean. But his candour was refreshing nevertheless.His vision for the company was also invigorating. He has set goals of $6bn in revenues in 2011 and metacritic scores of 80. Outsourcing and offshoring will bring down costs and two campuses have already been closed.He said he was unconcerned about the merger of Activision and Vivendi’s games unit to create the largest publisher later this year.“It’s really a non-event,” he said, arguing it would not make EA any more aggressive.“We’re already at max tilt, we have been changing a lot, we are our own worst critics.”He told analysts he had given an earlier version of his presentation to 225 top EA executives last August.“It was brutal,” he said.
284;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-01-23T07:56:09Z;Superscape receives $36m offer from Glu;;Superscape, the London-listed developer and publisher of games for mobile phones, has received a $36m offer for the company from Glu Mobile, the second largest US publisher.The offer price of 10p a share represents a 29 per cent premium to Superscape’s closing price on Tuesday of 7.75p. Glu said it had received irrevocable undertakings from shareholders representing 34 per cent of the outstanding shares and Superscape’s board of directors had unanimously recommended its bid.Superscape, founded in 1993, has evolved from a company focused on 3D virtual-reality technology to one that uses it in cellphone games it develops and publishes.It employs 135 people in offices in Fleet, Hampshire in the UK, San Clemente, California and Moscow.Superscape was a top-five publisher of mobile games in the US in the third quarter, according to the Nielsen Mobile research firm, with titles such as AMF Extreme Bowling, Dodgeball and Fight Club.Greg Ballard, Glu chief executive, told the Financial Times the acquisition would give it a substantial lead over its rival Gameloft in the US, while remaining number two behind Electronic Arts.“Superscape has a lot of titles that have got critical acclaim, it’s really its portfolio of casual games and original [intellectual property] that is attractive to us,” he said.The deal will be worth approximately $26m taking into account $11m in cash and equivalents on Superscape’s balance sheet at the end of October.
285;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-01-22T01:04:51Z;EA’s first free game is new battlefield;;The growing interest of traditional video game publishers in casual games looks like creating new hybrid formats and experimental business models.Electronic Arts has announced its first completely free title, Battlefield Heroes, available for download this summer.It looks like a dumbed-down cartoon-like version of its Battlefield 1942 PC game, but still seems far more sophisticated than a typical casual game such as Texas Hold ‘Em or Bejeweled.There will also be elements of the MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) genre, dominated by World of Warcraft. EA says players will be able to build their characters in an ever-expanding online world, paying a few dollars in micro-transactions for extra weapons and equipment. In-game advertising is also planned.The success of Microsoft’s Xbox Live service has revealed there is money to be made from smaller-scale games, available for download there for less than $10.EA is reinventing and repurposing an existing fading franchise. If it is successful, expect to see more of EA’s original IP appearing in a casualised form, aimed at less-than-hard-core gamers.
286;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2008-01-17T19:07:00Z;Scrabble squabble;;At first sight it is a battle between the quixotic (26 points) and the quartzy (28 points). On one side are two young entrepreneurs who have provided pleasure and time-wasting potential to millions through Scrabulous, an online word game that can be played on Facebook: on the other, are two corporate giants – Hasbro and Mattel which own the intellectual property rights to Scrabble – demanding the application be taken down.The reality is more complex. The two brothers, Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla, who launched Scrabulous in July 2006 are making more than $25,000 a month from their move. The owners of Scrabble are getting tough not with a couple of hobbyists but with people who are running a business.The breakthrough for Scrabulous came when it appeared on the social networking site. Now it claims more than 600,000 daily users, making it one of Facebook’s most popular applications.Enthusiasts have already set up “Save Scrabulous” groups. Some of them argue that Scrabble benefits from the interest that the online game has attracted with new sales of the board game, and warn that they will boycott Hasbro and Mattel products if Scrabulous disappears.These arguments miss the central point. Against whatever extra sales the online game may generate, must be set the damage it has already done to any licensed version that comes along. The presence of the unofficial game means that an authorised game will lack novelty. The ability to charge for it, once players have become used to joining in for free, is also reduced, and the brand itself has been diluted. Serious glitches experienced on Scrabulous could make players less willing to try an official online Scrabble game.There is also the fact that Electronic Arts has a licensing agreement for electronic versions of Hasbro games until 2013. Any settlement between the Scrabulous entrepreneurs and Hasbro and Mattel, must surely take account of the cost to EA as well.The quarrel over Scrabulous is a classic example of the challenges in maintaining intellectual property rights in a world where so much content is freely available on the internet. It requires nimble footwork to defend the product without sounding like a killjoy. The music industry is still wrestling with this.Even where unofficial usage represents a sincere tribute, owners of powerful brands must protect their intellectual property rights. When it comes to such valuable commodities, the highest-scoring seven-letter word is still control.
287;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;SCi in talks to raise capital as shares plummet;;SCi Entertainment, the UK’s largest computer games publisher, was yesterday understood to be in talks with a strategic industry partner to raise new working capital, as its shares fell to a five-year low.The deal could be similar to SCi’s sale of a 10 per cent equity stake to Time Warner in December 2006, which raised around £45m for the group.The deal also gave SCi access to Time Warner’s distribution network and rights to some high-profile intellectual property.SCi said that, while takeover talks had ended, it was exploring “certain commercial and strategic opportunities” that had come up as a result of the discussions. The company is believed to have been talking to CDC, the Chinese games company, as well as NBC Universal, the US film studio. It also had talks with Ubisoft of France last year until Ubisoft ruled itself out in October.The plans emerged as SCi shares halved in value, following a profits warning and an announcement that the company had ended talks for a potential takeover.Delays to the launch of four games, including the next Lara Croft title, Tombraider: Underworld, mean the company could need additional funding of around £30m, said Robert Brent, analyst at SCi’s house broker, KBC Peel Hunt.Mr Brent expects the company to make a loss of around £19m for 2008 due to the delays, although it should recoup this with profits of at least £20m next year.Nevertheless, the warning has raised questions about SCi’s viability as an independent company, and the shares fell to 62p, their lowest level since 2003. More than 17m shares changed hands, compared with average daily volumes of 1.1m.SCi is not the first games publisher to delay the launch of titles as the sector struggles to make the transition to the next generation of games consoles. Sales of Sony’s new PlayStation3 have been slower than expected, and games developers have had difficulties in getting games to work smoothly on the new consoles. Electronic Arts and Take Two in the US have already had to put back some launches, including the next version of Take Two’s popular Grand Theft Auto series.However, SCi is also struggling to make the transition from a niche games company to a publisher with global reach. It became the UK’s largest games publisher in 2005 after buying larger rival Eidos, but still lacks scale in the US, for example.“This transition is a challenging period for all, but for smaller companies it is greater because they don’t have the resources to change their release schedules without repercussions,” Mr Brent said.Some investors believe SCi should drop its publishing activities to focus just on developing its well-known games franchises, including Tombraider, Hitman, and their new best-selling game Kane & Lynch. Publishing can offer higher margins and more control over games, but without sufficient global scale it can be difficult to realise these benefits.Citigroup is acting as adviser to SCi in the fund-raising talks.
288;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-12-28T19:25:51Z;Accessory sales play into games sector’s hands;;"The video games industry is heading for a record year in sales of accessories as new kinds of controllers from balance boards to buzzers and guitar replicas are
introduced.More than $1.6bn in accessories were sold in the US up to the end of November, according to the NPD research firm – a 59 per cent increase over the previous record year of 2006.In Japan, Nintendo’s Wii Fit, a health-focused game featuring a balance board in the shape of bathroom scales, has been a best-seller since its launch on December 1, with more than half a million copies sold.The number-one game in the US in November was Activision’s Guitar Hero III, accounting for 17 per cent of revenues. It features a guitar accessory that allows gamers to play along in rhythm with popular rock songs.Games bundled with peripherals allow console makers and game publishers to increase selling prices. Electronic Arts has released Rock Band, a rival to Guitar Hero, featuring a guitar, drum set and microphone in a package costing about $170 on the Xbox 360.Wireless controllers remain among the best-selling peripherals. Sony’s PlayStation 3 wireless controller was number two in accessory sales in November, with controllers for the Nintendo Wii filling out the top five.Nintendo sold 232,000 Wii Zappers – a gun-shaped housing for its regular controller – during the month.New quiz games for consoles have also come with their own controllers.
SceneIt, a movie quiz for the Xbox 360, features four controllers with buzzers. Buzz!, a general knowledge quiz for the PlayStation 2, also
features four buzzers.Microsoft has reported record accessory “attach rates” for its Xbox 360 – an average of 3.3 have been bought per console."
289;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-12-03T21:52:11Z;Activision-Vivendi games deal boosts rivals;;Shares in video game publishers rose on Monday amid speculation that the merger of Activision and Vivendi’s games division to create the largest publisher would trigger an industry shake-up.Analysts welcomed the deal as “game-changing”, but warned that Vivendi’s World of Warcraft game it hinged on had an unpredictable future. Activision shares rose 13 per cent to $25.03 in morning trading. Vivendi shares rose 1 per cent to €31.71 on Monday. In a complicated deal, Vivendi is injecting its games business into Activision to create a new company valued at an estimated $18.9bn, Activision Blizzard. Vivendi is also buying $1.7bn worth of shares to generate cash for a subsequent tender offer.Activision shareholders will be offered $27.50 a share in a buyback that could lift Vivendi’s stake in the new company from 52 per cent to 68 per cent.Take Two Interactive, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto game and the subject of frequent takeover speculation, rose 6 per cent, while Ubisoft shares rose nearly 10 per cent at one point in Paris on speculation that Electronic Arts would increase its 15 per cent stake in the French publisher.Shares in EA, the world’s biggest video game publisher, fell 1.5 per cent to $55.30 as investors digested the prospect of the emergence of a larger rival.Brent Thill, Citigroup analyst, said in a note: “Smaller publishers like THQ and Take-Two could benefit as global media companies are likely to kickstart their video game acquisition strategies post Vivendi’s move”.Jonathan Weitz of media consultants IBB said: “The environment has been right for the last year or two for media companies to take greater stakes in video game publishers.”Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision, who will head the enlarged entity, said Activision would have had to risk hundreds of millions of dollars to try to duplicate the success of Blizzard Entertainment’s online fantasy hit, World of Warcraft. The game has 9.3m subscribers and has made Vivendi the only western publisher to show a significant profit in Asia.Michael Savner of Bank of America Securities said the deal was a game-changer but Vivendi’s own endgame was unclear and World of Warcraft could fall out of favour with players. Brent Thill said it generated about 75 per cent of Vivendi Games’ revenues, but questioned how long the phenomenon could last.Additional reporting by Adam Jones in Paris
290;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-12-02T19:31:06Z;Complex deal to bring Activision from EA’s shadow;;Activision has finally emerged from the shadow of its larger rival Electronic Arts with its agreement to merge with the games division of France’s Vivendi.In a masterstroke by Bobby Kotick, chief executive, it has gained a similar geographical reach to EA and a highly profitable subscription revenue stream.EA and Activision have failed to expand into the market for massively multiplayer online role-playing games, which have enjoyed huge popularity in Asia.World of Warcraft, created by Vivendi’s Blizzard Entertainment, is the dominant game in the genre worldwide with 9.3m players paying monthly subscriptions to continue to explore the expanding virtual world.Activision Blizzard is being formed in a complex cash and shares transaction valuing it at $18.9bn. Electronic Arts has a market capitalisation of $17.7bn.The new company will have $3.8bn in revenues in the 2007 calendar year, while EA is expecting $3.5bn in revenues for its fiscal year ending in March 2008.Activision Blizzard and EA would be closely matched, but Mr Kotick can finally claim to have achieved the industry leadership he has sought since taking over Activision in 1991.“When we acquired the company, I always felt the opportunity was to become the number-one company in the category,” he said in a recent interview with the Financial Times. “That aspiration hasn’t changed.”The price to pay for achieving that is control. While he remains chief executive of the new company, Vivendi will own 52 per cent of the shares and could raise its stake to 68 per cent through a planned share buy-back. Vivendi suggested it would not be a sleeping partner – it will have six directors on the new 11-member board.“We look forward to being an active and supportive majority stockholder in a company that is poised to lead the worldwide interactive entertainment industry in the years ahead,” said Jean-Bernard Lévy, Vivendi chief executive.In an interview with the FT, he described Activision as the “perfect fit” for Vivendi’s games unit, complementing its strength in subscription-based gaming. “Its strong points are in the console business,” he said.In spite of the strong growth posted by Vivendi Games recently, it has sometimes been overlooked because it was significantly smaller than other Vivendi divisions, such as Universal Music, the world’s biggest recorded music group, or Canal Plus, the pay-TV group. The alliance with Activision would put the games business on a more equal footing, Mr Lévy said.He added the deal would not involve an unacceptable dilution of the strong profitability of the internet-based subscription model that has been so successful for World of Warcraft. “Yes, the margins are huge in the online business, but they are very nice in the console business.”Mr Lévy said there might be ways of using Universal’s record catalogue as downloads for Guitar Hero, Activision’s hit rock guitar simulation game. “It is not by chance that Doug Morris [the head of Universal] will sit on the board of Activision.”He said Mark Morhaime, president and chief executive of Blizzard, and other key Blizzard employees had committed to staying for at least five years. The deal is subject to the approval of Activision shareholders and regulatory approval.
291;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-12-02T19:10:38Z;Vivendi and Activision;;Vivendi seems to revel in the notion of being a holding company. The French group already has the bulk of its value tied up in stakes in telecoms operator SFR, pay-television operator Canal Plus and US entertainment group NBC Universal, controlled by General Electric. Now it is injecting its fully owned games business into US rival Activision in return for a controlling stake. Why?For Vivendi, the complex deal will replace its somewhat overlooked video games publishing business with a powerful stake of between 52 per cent and 68 per cent in a group that will challenge market leader Electronic Arts. That will provide a clear market valuation for Vivendi’s business, although the $8.1bn being claimed upfront relies on a degree of circularity in the complex transaction.The deal also diversifies Vivendi’s Blizzard business away from a heavy reliance on games such as World of Warcraft, adds Activision’s management team and provides a separate share currency to try to attract key gaming talent.Activision, meanwhile, gets exposure to new Asian markets and online gaming, the fast-growing area where Vivendi has made huge strides. That is particularly important because of the recurring revenues it offers, compared with more cyclical console-based sales. Activision shareholders also get the option of taking a 25 per cent premium in cash for a portion of their shares. And, despite ceding overall control to Vivendi, Robert Kotick will remain as chief executive of the combined group.Vivendi will rely heavily on him to squeeze the benefits the two sides expect from the deal. But, in contrast to 2003, when it ceded control of its US media assets to GE, Vivendi will ultimately be in the driving seat.
292;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-11-29T05:11:03Z;Games developer makes China gambit;;Glu Mobile, a leading provider of games for cell phones, has agreed to pay up to $40m for Mig, China’s biggest mobile games developer and publisher.The acquisition gives Glu an advantage over Electronic Arts and Gameloft, its main rivals, which have yet to establish a mobile foothold in China.Mig will give Glu access to China’s 500m mobile subscribers and the local knowledge needed to succeed in an Asian games market where western companies have until now failed to make inroads.The Silicon Valley-based company said it would pay around $14.7m in cash for Mig, with additional payments of up to $25m in cash and stock, contingent on certain financial milestones being achieved in 2008.Mig’s existing management team will stay in place and Glu will add 80 employees from Mig offices in Beijing and Hefei.Greg Ballard, Glu chief executive, told the Financial Times that he expected the Chinese market for mobile games to grow significantly.He said: “In the past few years, the platform has not been particularly stable for downloading and buying games – you could lose your signal.“But [operator] China Mobile has now made music and games a priority and has put a lot of work into a new platform,” he said.He said the acquisition was a “huge step forward” in the Asian market.“We have been an outsider looking in, on what is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world.”Glu plans to use Mig to help it introduce some of its western titles to China.It expects a modest contribution to its revenue from the acquisition in 2008, while earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 are expected to be reduced by less than one cent a share.
293;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-11-27T19:19:48Z;Holiday sales cheer for Activision;;Activision boosted the US video game sector on Tuesday as it reported better-than-expected sales of its key holiday titles. Shares in the publisher rose nearly 13 per cent to $21.33 in midday trading in New York on the news, while those of the world’s biggest publisher, Electronic Arts), were up 3.2 per cent.For its third quarter ending December 31, Activision said it was forecasting record sales of $1.225bn and earnings per share of 66 cents. This was an increase from its previous guidance of $1.050bn in revenues and earnings of 51 cents a share.Bobby Kotick, Activision chief executive, said the company was on its way to the most profitable year in its history after a strong consumer response to its titles in October and strong retail sales over the Thanksgiving weekend.“We are confident that the third quarter of fiscal 2008 will be the largest and most profitable quarter ever,” he added.“Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and our newly released Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare already are two of the biggest entertainment titles this year.”Guitar Hero, which features a guitar-shaped controller and allows gamers to play along to well-known hits, has been a hugely profitable franchise for Activision. EA responded last week with the release of Rock Band, a similar game with a microphone and controllers for guitar, bass and drums.Call of Duty has also become a best-selling “first-person shooter” based on the second world war, although its latest version puts the combat in a present-day setting.While EA has a bigger international reach than Activision, the smaller Santa Monica-based company has been the biggest third-party publisher in the US for nine out of 10 months this year.Its market share reached a record 28.7 per cent in October, according to the NPD research firm.Video game publishers are benefiting from selling to a larger installed base of games consoles.Among next-generation consoles, the Nintendo Wii has been selling out since it launched a year ago, the Xbox 360 has been on sale for two years and even sales of Sony’s lagging PlayStation 3 have picked up following a price cut.Sony said on Monday that PS3 sales on Black Friday – the day after Thanksgiving – were up 245 per cent compared with the same day a year ago.
294;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-11-09T04:18:15Z;Mobile gaming takes a second-quarter fall;;The mobile gaming industry has hit a bump on its road to growth.Revenues for publishers declined by 9 per cent in the second quarter, compared to the first, when revenues were up 11 per cent on the fourth quarter, according to the iSuppli research firm.Its report says the pace of growth is slowing and one of the main problems for the industry is the small number of subscribers for mobile games. It suggests the demographic could be widened if games could take advantage of phones and be more networked and multiplayer.A week ago, shares in Glu Mobile fell 33 per cent after it predicted a fourth-quarter loss of 6 to 7 cents a share, compared to Wall Street expectations of a loss of 2 cents.It blamed slowing business in Europe where carriers were ordering fewer games as they changed the way they managed their businesses.Analysts said the industry was suffering from growing pains. ISuppli suggests carriers are turning to the mobile video market instead, which it says holds the most upside potential of premium content categories.Greg Ballard, Glu’s chief executive, visited us recently. He admitted the US was trailing Japan and Korea, where companies such as Namco and Sega were moving forward with multiplayer games on more sophisticated phones.Glu was also still very dependent on carriers – 95 per cent of its games were delivered through 160 carriers. He expects downloads to shift more to the Web over the next three to five years, as well as to sideloading at retail through memory cards that handsets can now increasingly accommodate.Glu sees itself as the most independent of the big three mobile game players in the West – Gameloft is backed by the video game publisher Ubisoft and Electronic Arts has bought Jamdat.David Gosen, the head of mobile publisher I-play and another recent visitor, said Glu’s flotation on the Nasdaq in March has helped the profile of the industry. He believes more user-friendly handsets, all-you-can-eat data plans and big brands entering the sector will unlock the market in a big way over the next 12 to 18 months.ISuppli’s forecasts back him up – it expects mobile gaming revenues to nearly triple by 2011, growing to $6.6bn, for a compound annual growth rate of 23 per cent.That makes this year’s second-quarter slump seem like only a pause in a game, before the industry leaps to the next level.
295;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-11-02T01:53:37Z;EA looks to holiday season after net loss;;Falling sales led Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video game publisher, to a net loss in the second quarter but the performance was not as bad as some analysts had predicted.Shares in EA, whose titles include Madden NFL 08 and FIFA 08, rose 3.3 per cent in after-hours trading after the company said it expected a “great holiday season” and raised its sales forecast by $150m for the full fiscal year.“Our strategic priorities on quality, innovation and managing cost are showing progress,” said John Riccitiello, chief executive.EA, which has been struggling to recover from a sales slump that has seen it cede market share to smaller rivals this year, said it had made a net loss of $195m in the quarter ended in September, compared with a net profit of $22m the year before.The swing into the red came as sales fell 18 per cent to $640m.EA said part of the loss was driven by a change in the way it accounts for sales of online games.EA last week announced that it would close some of its offices and cut jobs as part of a restructuring designed to cut costs.Last month, EA said it would spend more than $800m to acquire Bioware and Pandemic Studios, two makers of action-adventure games, in an attempt to plug one of the big remaining holes in its games portfolio.The company said it planned to launch 10 new titles, including a game based on the hit animated film The Simpsons.EA said it now expected sales of $3.35bn to $3.65bn for the full year, an increase of $150m over previous forecasts.Shares of EA slipped 3.9 per cent to $58.74 on Thursday ahead of the earnings announcement. The shares had climbed more than 20 per cent from a recent low in May.EA’s results came as THQ, its biggest rival, also swung to a loss for the quarter.THQ had warned last week that disappointing sales would result in a wider-than-expected loss for the period. THQ’s shares slipped 2 per cent in after-hours trading.
296;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Game player with a serious goal;;"Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision, likes to play guitar on one of the video game publisher’s biggest hits.Guitar Hero satisfies his air guitarist dreams by letting him take charge of the instrument-shaped controller and mimic classic rock anthems.But Mr Kotick is not a centre-stage, arm-swinging axeman when he plays – he prefers background rhythm to being lead guitarist. “I’m not really a music person,” he says. “I don’t really pay as much attention to the music as I do to the rhythm; I’m very focused on getting that right.”Staying out of the creative process while concentrating on the underlying processes has also served him well in management. He has brought his company from insolvency through a spectacular growth period over the past 16 years. In the first eight months of this year, Activision became the leading US third-party publisher – publishers licensed by the console makers, who also make their own “first-party” games – finally overtaking its biggest rival, Electronic Arts, in sales.Mr Kotick does not have the appearance of an industry veteran. In spite of being the longest-serving chief executive among the big five US publishers – EA, Activision, THQ, Take-Two and Midway Games – he cuts a youthful figure, at the age of 44, and has a puckish sense of humour.Then again, his coiffed hair and elegant suits do not fit the image of an unconventional industry or of someone who had started a company developing software for Apple computers in college, before getting into video games.He failed to complete his course in art history at the University of Michigan but is now a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and a serious collector of post-war American art.Mr Kotick therefore cuts a Renaissance figure in the industry, as someone who is both patron and creator of the latest art forms and has made their development possible by persistent profitability. He has combined passion with process in a business where organised chaos has often reigned.Before taking charge of Activision, he ran a company called Leisure Concepts – a licensing agent for Nintendo that handled image rights for its game character Mario the Plumber on everything from T-shirts to breakfast cereal packets. But he really wanted to be a licensee, making video games with the console maker’s permission.It was when he was in charge of Leisure Concepts that he spotted an opportunity in an insolvent games publisher: “Activision – they’d actually changed their name to Mediagenic, which I think is one of the worst names in corporate American history – were the first Nintendo licensee and the first third-party software publisher, and they were insolvent,” he says.“The few hundred people left at the company referred to it as Lackovision and I think they suffered a lot from that, combined with a challenging industry at the time.”Mr Kotick traded out of his stake in Leisure Concepts and bought a 25 per cent stake in Mediagenic in December 1990. In March 1991, he and his associates took charge of the company.“The day we got control, the sheriff’s marshals were there taking away our mainframe computer with all our customer data. We had to sell the furniture to make payroll the next month. It was quite a mess.”Heavy job losses followed, the company was recapitalised the following year, the Activision name was restored and the decision was taken to move from Silicon Valley to Santa Monica, close to the Hollywood movie studios and their
talent pools.The relationship has been getting closer ever since. Activision subsequently won rights to franchises such as Spider-Man, Shrek and James Bond. “If you own Hollywood property and you want to have it in interactive media, I think we’re the first stop,” says Mr Kotick. “Being here, we feel we have this unique perspective, an appreciation of what’s important to our partners.”The video game business is also getting more like Hollywood. Mr Kotick feels the latest consoles provide the power for game developers to tell stories with cinematic realism, create compelling characters and provoke emotions in players that will help companies such as Activision expand their audience beyond the traditional core of young male gamers.In the early 1990s, cartridge games dominated and Activision lacked major franchises. Instead, it had to resuscitate some of its own intellectual property such as the 1980s dungeon adventure series Zork and jungle game Pitfall!. Mr Kotick says the company has never failed to make a profit since those early years.“We’ve always operated under the belief that you could run a video game business as professionally as you could run a consumer packaged goods business and you wouldn’t diminish creativity.“I think I always thought I was running Procter & Gamble – it didn’t really occur to me that it wasn’t an enormously successful, professionally managed company, even on the days we were selling the furniture.”To maintain the creative spirit, Mr Kotick has allowed Activision’s various development studios, many of them acquired, to remain independent operations with their own names, culture and budget responsibilities (see below left).At the same time, he has borrowed the focus-group techniques of the consumer goods industry. Studios are encouraged to use them to carry out audience research.The chief executive also believes in trying to “map the market” – making sure that Activision’s portfolio and coverage closely follows market trends. This requires a balanced approach of having original properties, such as its Call of Duty second world war game, combined with licensed titles such as Transformers. It also means achieving a balance of revenues geographically. He admits Activision still has some way to travel in competing with Electronic Arts overseas and, like other US publishers, has failed to make an impression in Japan.The company’s earnings and revenues have grown at a compound rate of more than 30 per cent over the past seven years. It expects operating income of $250m on net sales of $1.87bn in the current fiscal year. That gives it just under 10 per cent of the $22bn market, excluding Japan, for packaged games. Mr Kotick is focused on expanding that market share.“When we acquired the company, I always felt the opportunity was to become the number-one company in the category,” he says. “That aspiration hasn’t changed.”Collecting creatives a winning tactic in games arenaWhen Activision bought video game developer Bizarre Creations, based in Liverpool in the UK last month, it was following strict criteria laid down by Bobby Kotick for making acquisitions.The US publisher has acquired a dozen companies in the past five years, most of them studios with a history of successful work. “You want profitability, some proprietary development capability that is proven and successful, you want them to have a history of multi-million unit sellers, you want good management and you want it to be non-dilutive financially,” he says. “The few times that we haven’t stuck to that criteria, we’ve made mistakes.”The chief executive is also looking for companies with the potential to lead categories. Last year he bought RedOctane, publisher of the Guitar Hero franchise, and Infinity Ward in 2003, which developed the Call of Duty second world war game.He says independent studios have been falsely accused of lacking discipline. “We pick our studios carefully and allow an independent culture. I find them deadline-focused, milestone-driven, incredibly responsible and sensitive to the needs of the audiences.”"
297;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-09-19T21:08:48Z;EA hunts for Japan game outfit;;Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video games publisher, is hunting for a partnership or acquisition in Japan in a bid to achieve greater penetration in the second-biggest gaming market after the US.Jon Niermann, president of EA Asia, said Japan was a “strategic priority” for the company.Japan comprises 20 per cent of the overall $30bn games market, yet remains a single-digit percentage of EA’s overall revenues.Mr Niermann, in an interview with the Financial Times, said EA was looking at linking up with blue-chip players, as well as smaller firms.“[We are] exploring everything from established companies to new companies,” he said. “The relatively young start-up type companies that have promising talent that come from some of the bigger companies – it is very interesting to look at those.”Only 6 per cent of EA’s revenues are generated from the Asian market, with the remainder evenly split between the US and Europe. Last month, the video games titan reported wider losses in the first quarter and said its market share had fallen to the mid-teens in percentage terms, after failing to capitalise fully on the success of Nintendo’s Wii.“[The question is] can we get to the scale that we want to more quickly if we work with someone [in Japan] that actually has had success in the market,” said Mr Niermann. “I think EA offers a great global distribution opportunity in terms of taking Japanese products to other parts of the world and in turn there are certainly companies that are much better at local development than we’ve ramped up to be.”EA has partnerships with local firms in Asia’s two-biggest growth markets: China and South Korea.In Japan, Mr Niermann said he expected to see growth in the online games market, as well as an increase in demand for mobile phone games.Though Mr Niermann said it was “too soon to tell” which next-generation console had dominated the market, he admitted that Nintendo’s Wii had “broadened the market” with its appeal to the non-core gamer – women and older individuals.“Nintendo got it right,” said Mr Niermann. “We all benefit from that as an industry.”EA is attempting to push into the online games market in China by partnering with The9, the country’s leading online games operator.In Korea, it has made a similar push into the online market via its partnership with Neowiz.Mr Niermann was speaking on the eve of the Tokyo Game Show, the world’s largest, which kicks off today. Analysts expect Sony to cut the price on its poor-selling 80-gigabyte PlayStation 3 model to $499 and to reduce further the price of the PS2 – the best-selling games console ever – from $129 to $99.
298;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Codemasters muscles in on SCi;;Codemasters is about to give SCi Entertainment a run for its money as the biggest computer games publisher in the UK.Rod Cousens, chief executive of the Warwickshire-based company, is aiming for £250m of annual sales in the medium term and is planning a flotation early next year that could value the company at more than £200m. Goldman Sachs, which paid £50m for a stake in the business in June, is expected to be lead adviser on the initial public offering.Codemasters, known for its Colin McRae rallying and Brian Lara cricket games, expects sales of about £75m for the year to June and profits of £6m.It is much smaller than SCi but catching up fast. Codemasters sales are up more than 40 per cent from last year after a turnround by new management.“These will be the largest revenues the company has recorded and set us up nicely,” Mr Cousens says.Codemasters’ entry on to the public markets signals a resurgence for the UK games industry, which has struggled since the dotcom crash.The UK has been a hotspot for games development since the 1980s, with UK studios creating hits such as the Lara Croft series and Grand Theft Auto. However, the UK has struggled to create large publishing businesses to rival Electronic Arts of the US and Ubisoft of France. SCi Entertainment is the only listed UK games publisher.Codemasters, which employs more than 500 people, mainly at its sprawling, farmland-surrounded headquarters just outside Leamington Spa, has mirrored the highs and lows of the UK games industry.Founded in 1986 by the Darling brothers, Richard and David, it began a slow decline after the dotcom boom, struggling to keep up with production costs for new games consoles such as the PlayStation2 and Microsoft’s Xbox.The costs of creating games has soared from about $500,000 (£246,000) for the PlayStation 1, to $3-$5m for the PlayStation 2, and $20-30m for PlayStation 3.When Codemasters made a loss in 2004, it was clear changes needed to be made. Balderton Capital came in as an investor in 2005 and in June this year bought out the Darling family.Balderton appointed a new management team, including Mr Cousens, industry veteran and previous head of Acclaim Entertainment, publisher of the Mortal Kombat games, which filed for bankruptcy in 2004.They aim to broaden the appeal of the company’s games, particularly in the US, where gamers are unfamiliar with rally racing and have no interest in cricket.“The cost of development is such that Codemasters needs a global range for its games, rather than the eurocentric content of the past,” Mr Cousens says.A recently released “Dirt road” version of the Colin McRae game and Overlord, a humorous action and fantasy game, made it into the US top-five games charts.A recent deal with Warner Brothers, which handles its games distribution in the US, also opens doors.The US accounted for a quarter of sales last year, up from a historic 10 per cent. They are expected to hit 40 per cent in 2008.Mr Cousens is also investing in new areas, such as online, multiplayer games. This year, the company launched an official Lord of the Rings online game, which became the top-selling US PC game,Codemasters plans several more online games and a raft of console titles, including a Dirty Dancing game.“We’ve made a good start in ticking all the boxes, updating legacy titles, creating new ones and investing in new platforms such as online,” says Mr Cousens.It remains to be seen, however, whether this portfolio will be enough to propel the company into the big league, and whether the company behind Brian Lara cricket will one day rival the other Lara as the UK’s biggest gaming success.
299;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-08-07T18:51:18Z;Microsoft raises ante in price wars;;A price war took hold of the US gaming market on Tuesday when Microsoft followed Sony’s move last month to reduce the price of its core console.The decision to cut the price of the Xbox 360 reflects slowing momentum for a product that plays a key role in the company’s broader consumer strategy, according to analysts.It is also expected to turn the console back into a loss-making product for Microsoft, although the company should still be on track to hit its target of finally breaking through into profitability in the games business in its current fiscal year, they added.Microsoft announced on Tuesday that it would cut $50 from the price of the most popular model of the console, to $349. Two other configurations of the Xbox 360 will be cut by $20 and $30.The timing of the cut, be­fore the busy autumn season, was earlier than expected, analysts said, and pointed to competition in part of the market from the cheaper Wii console from Nintendo.Last month, Sony sliced $100 from the $599 price tag of its basic PS3 console.Average monthly sales of the Xbox 360 dropped to 200,000 in the first six months of this year, from about 700,000 in the first 14 months the machine was on the market, said Matt Rosoff, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft. “It’s the cornerstone of Microsoft’s home entertainment strategy,” he added, making it vital for the company to ship the machine in higher volumes.Microsoft said that the price cut had been timed to coincide with the release next week of Madden NFL 08, the latest in a popular series of big-selling football games from Electronic Arts.According to the company, the lack of any earlier price cut since the launch of the console in November 2005 makes it the longest period a new machine has been able to hold its original sale price. But the fact that the Xbox was launched nearly a year before rival consoles from Sony and Nintendo meant that it was under no pressure for much of that time to consider any competitive action, said Van Baker, analyst at Gartner.While Microsoft had reached break-even on the Xbox 360, “it will probably go negative again” with the price cut, said Charles di Bona, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein. The launch of the latest version of the big-selling Halo game in late September, however, should lift the company’s games business to its first quarterly profit for the first time since the previous version of Halo, as well as its first ever full-year of profits, he added.A broader trend in the games business, where growth is coming increasingly from casual and “social” games, could have contributed to the slowing momentum for sales of consoles aimed at the traditional “hard core” market of young males, some analysts said.“The gaming environment is radically different from the last two or three generations of consoles,” said Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering.Console makers are being forced to fight harder for audience time as their users adopt newer online and gaming habits, from social networking to the different experience embodied in the controller to the new Wii console, he added.Thanks to the broader appeal of the Wii and its presence in hand-held games, Nintendo seemed better positioned for these trends than Microsoft or Sony, Mr Doherty said.
300;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-08-03T16:07:00Z;Battle of the video game bands;;"The major news that Grand Theft Auto IV will not provide the blockbuster success the console makers crave this autumn obscured another set of impressive earnings from Activision on Thursday.The Santa Monica video games publisher had better financial news than all the other major US players – Electronic Arts, THQ, Take-Two and Midway – who also made announcements over the past two days.Activision could be the major beneficiary of Take-Two delaying GTA IV. Without the competition , its Call of Duty 4 is now likely to be the best selling game on the PlayStation 3 this year.Activision is currently the number-one publisher in the US of third-party titles – those not made by the console makers.Bobby Kotick, chief executive, told us in an interview its success was down to good management, a little luck and a great franchise strategy.One major franchise under threat from a bigger rival, Electronic Arts, is Guitar Hero, a game that puts an axe-shaped controller in the hands of air guitarists.EA is releasing Rock Band for the holiday season. which expands the range of instruments so that several players at once can perform a song.Mr Kotick believes Guitar Hero can fight off the challenge, describing Guitar Hero as a game and Rock Band as more of a collaborative tool.""We are on every format in every geography with localised content,"" he says, adding that the price of jamming with friends in Rock Band could run to $300 for all the ""instruments""."
301;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-07-18T00:51:11Z;EA lures head of Microsoft’s Xbox;;Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video games publisher, has lured the head of Microsoft’s Xbox and games business to head its new EA Sports label.Peter Moore is a leading figure in the industry and his departure will be viewed as a blow to Microsoft and a considerable boost to EA under its new chief executive, John Riccitiello.“We’re thrilled, he’s someone I’ve tried to recruit for the best part of a decade,” said Mr Riccitiello, in a Financial Times interview.Both external and internal candidates had been considered, but Mr Moore was “essentially the dream candidate, who will help our team realise its potential”, said Mr Riccitiello.Microsoft announced on Tuesday that Don Mattrick, a 16-year veteran of Electronic Arts and former head of EA’s worldwide studios, would succeed Mr Moore at the end of the month.Mr Mattrick resigned from EA in February last year and had been working as an adviser to Microsoft for the past six months.Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft’s Entertainment and Devices division, said: “Peter has been a central part of what we have created with Xbox and I’m sad to see him leave. I wish he could continue to be here, but he is passionate about sports and will still be working with us as a partner.”Mr Moore is a keen football player and fan and began his career as a physical education teacher in England, studying the psychology and sociology of sport. He went on to be US president of the Patrick sportswear company, senior vice-president of marketing at the Reebok sports shoe company, and then president of video games publisher Sega in the US.He has earned a reputation as a showman at Microsoft – last week he performed on bass guitar at the E3 video games convention in Santa Monica to show off the new Rock Band game.“I couldn’t be more excited about joining EA and moving my family to San Francisco,” he said.His appointment completes the reorganisation by Mr Riccitiello of EA under different labels.
302;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-07-13T20:36:42Z;EA chief plans simpler games;;Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video game publisher, plans to set a trend of “natural gaming” under its new chief executive that will appeal to audiences beyond hard-core fans.John Riccitiello said EA would introduce a “family mode” in its sports titles in the coming months that would allow inexperienced gamers to play more by intuition than knowing their way around a controller.“One of the examples [of games] that people put forward as being increasingly hard to play unfortunately is EA Sports, a lot of people would say that,” Mr Riccitiello told the Financial Times at the E3 video game summit in Santa Monica.Beginning with its most popular title, Madden NFL ’08, available this summer, individual players will be able to choose a mode that moves them automatically to the right place and character in the game.“Your job is just to kick ass or to catch, it’s alarming how much fun it is …so this will provide for multi-generational gameplay,” he said.EA’s efforts mirror those of Nintendo, which has made gaming more intuitive with innovations such as motion-sensing on the Wii that allows game-playing by the mere waving of the controller. This is attracting a wider demographic to gaming, which Mr Riccitiello supports.“We can blend more people into that core [gamer] market if we explore accessibility, we can make adjustments to our game design that will bring more people into the game industry faster.”The chief executive also cites Skate, a new EA skateboarding game that allows users to perform tricks by moving the wheel on the controller in an imitation of the action, rather than remembering a combination of buttons.“That’s a pretty fundamental innovation in the interface, it’s natural gaming if you will, it’s something different than we’ve seen before.”Since he rejoined EA as chief executive on April 1 after a stint in private equity, Mr Riccitiello has been a critic of the industry’s tendency to build ever more complex games in a bid to satisfy its hard-core audience.“The number of people that find our games and others too hard to initiate and have fun with is legion and it’s a barrier that we’ve erected ourselves,” he said.“In a weird sort of way, we’re worshipping the game-review gods as opposed to thinking about the marketplace and people who might want to buy our products.”
303;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Video games have rediscovered fun;;"Each year at E3, the video games industry’s meeting in Los Angeles, one title captures the imagination of the media, analysts and game enthusiasts. Usually, it is a violent point-and-shoot game such as Halo, a crunching sports franchise such as Madden NFL or a mythical conflict such as Final Fantasy.This week, the highlight was a goofball performance of David Bowie’s “Suffragette City” performed by four executives of Harmonix to show off Rock Band, their karaoke game. Two strummed plastic guitars, another played miniature drums and a fourth sang while their scores (for how well they followed Bowie’s band) totted up on screen. It was a video game, but not as E3 has known it.At another event, Shigero Miyamoto, Nintendo’s gaming guru, showed off a new accessory for its Wii console. It was a floor pad for use with Wii Fit, a fitness title that involves players exercising to games on screen. Meanwhile, executives from the games maker Electronic Arts played virtual dodgeball on a Wii, using its motion-sensitive controller to jump and throw the ball.It was all low-tech, human and fun compared with the intense focus on state-of-the-art video games designed for high-definition consoles such as the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 that dominated recent E3s. Until this year, games for portable devices such as the Nintendo DS or mobile phones and family games were regarded by the aficionados as second-rate compared with the real thing.Now the industry is in shock. The launch of Sony’s Playstation 3, the most high-tech and expensive of the new consoles, has been problematic, while the Wii, written off by insiders as Nintendo’s last effort before getting out of the console-making business, has been a sell-out. Offbeat games such as Nintendogs and Brain Age, an intelligence testing game for the Nintendo DS, are all the rage.Companies such as Electronic Arts, which placed most of their resources behind the PS3 and Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and treated the Wii as a curiosity, are shifting ground. EA normally rolls out stars to endorse its sports games but this week showed off its casual games arm. “Things need to be very simple; highlight on fun,” said Kathy Vrabeck, the division’s head.With hindsight, forgetting about fun was an odd mistake to make for an industry that produces games. In fact, many best-selling titles are battles rather than games; they are cheerless affairs involving players killing hordes of aliens and zombies. The exemplar is Halo, the third version of which comes out on September 25. Halo popularised the Xbox and is close to being a $1bn franchise.The industry was led astray by two things. The first was the sensibility of “core gamers” – young men in their teens and 20s who are rabid fans of titles such as Halo and Grand Theft Auto. These gamers have little patience any more for the kind of simple games such as Tetris and Donkey Kong with which the industry started out about 30 years ago.Core gamers tend to like virtual violence, dark and brooding storylines and games that require a high level of skill and accumulated knowledge. As big franchises have evolved – both Metal Gear Solid 5 and Resident Evil 5 come out shortly – they have become harder to play. “These games have a level of complexity most consumers do not care about,” says Reggie Fils-Aime, head of Nintendo US.The industry’s second error was to fall in love with technology and visual realism. Both Sony and Microsoft have built high-definition consoles that allow graphics to be displayed on flat-screen televisions in wonderful depth and detail. But, although these games look better than before, they play the same as in earlier versions on Playstation 2 or the Xbox.Nintendo eschewed high-definition for the DS and the Wii because it thought that would make the devices too expensive. Instead, it changed the experience by getting users to interact differently. The DS has a touch screen and the Wii has controllers that can mimic gestures on screen. This week, Nintendo unveiled the Zapper, which allows users to play point-and-shoot games as they do in arcades.Traditionalists, such as Kaz Hirai, the head of Sony’s Playstation division, pooh-pooh the idea that the industry is at an inflection point. He points to the Playstation 2, which started as the preserve of core gamers but was later bought by families. Sony has now sold 118m Playstation 2s and developers are making casual games titles for the device.But families are not meekly waiting to follow core gamers this time. The Wii is out-selling Playstation 3 already and is likely to overtake Xbox 360 as the leading console. This is pulling developers towards making more titles for the Wii, which will reinforce its profitability and its consumer appeal. The influence of the casual gamer is rivalling that of core gamers.Developers will not only have to rethink the kind of games they make but also how the existing titles work. John Riccitiello, chief executive of Electronic Arts, cites a recent change his company made to its Wii version of Madden NFL. It has introduced a “family mode” that makes it easier to control the onscreen players. That allows novices to compete quickly with experienced players.We have not seen the end of monsters, zombies and soldiers dying in hails of bullets and gushers of blood. But this year’s E3 provided hope that the tastes of 100m young men will not rule the industry for another decade.Training virtual dogs; playing the guitar; stepping to music: who knew that video games could be so wholesome?

304;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-07-12T23:50:00Z;EA chief is in the game again;;Santa Monica: John Riccitiello says returning to Electronic Arts as chief executive was the only job offer he considered seriously in his three years in private equity with Silicon Valley’s Elevation Partners.While with Elevation, he oversaw a major investment that brought together developers Bioware and Pandemic Studios and he carried out due diligence on a number of other video game companies.“I went through virtually every game company out there and had unprecedented access to people that now probably rue the day they agreed to let me in their door. But I got some pretty good insights,” he told us in an interview at the E3 Media and Business Summit.Mr Riccitiello was president and chief operating officer at EA from 1997 to 2004, when he left to help set up Elevation. He returned to replace Larry Probst as CEO on April 1 and has been carrying out due diligence on the state of his company and the industry since then. Here are his thoughts:On why he came back: “Being a private equity guy is master of the universe these days and it’s harder to do better than being a founding partner, so it’s a good gig. During the time I was gone, I got called by media magnates to be CEO of a number of different companies and it was always very easy to say thanks but no thanks.“When Larry and the board approached me about EA, that’s a different question and it’s hard to describe how intertwined my emotions and history and relationships are with EA. It was about a company that I am profoundly motivated to work in and a company in particular in which I’ve got massive passion and belief. I felt I could make a difference and be helpful.”On the state of the company: “It’s very clear that some companies performed better than we have during the [console] transition in terms of top and bottom line growth. We’ve got to drive our business really aggressively, we’ve got to put distance between us and our competitors and make it exceptionally clear that we’re not just the biggest, we’re absolutely the best. I think people are leveling criticism at us on a couple of different fronts and we’ve got to address that and move beyond people’s expectations whether it’s product quality or top and bottom line growth.”On his current focus: “It‘s the innovation level of our games. In particular, I’m focused on innovation and accessibility, things that are going to drive new people into the industry. I just think we have to set a higher standard for innovation and we have when we are at our best – we just haven’t been at our best as an industry often enough. I also am focusing on success on a number of strategic fronts like online or wireless or Asia or the new casual business we’re pursuing.”On how deeper games needn’t be harder ones: “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the only game in the history of our industry that has sold 20m units is also one of the easiest games to pick up and play ever made – this is [Take-Two’s] Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. I don’t think you have to be inaccessible to be deep. GTA is deep, it’s rich, it rewards the core game player, it’s one of the highest-rated games and it was easy to play – you could finish it and have fun if you didn’t have fast thumbs and had to master a whole series of skills, so that [depth] and inaccessibility are not a trade off.”On innovative upcoming EA titles: “Army of 2 is a fantastic title, Spore is a game that may be viewed as the most innovative game of the last few years industry wide when we put that out in about a year. Then there’s Rock Band and Boogie, which sort of takes the piss out of other music games, it is so simple, it is so much fun. I could give you a long list.”
305;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-07-09T04:09:47Z;Game start-up woos investors;;Leading media companies Bertelsmann, NBC-Universal and Time Warner have taken part in a $30m funding round for a video game start-up developing a new form of real-time gaming over broadband networks.Silicon Valley-based Trion World Network has yet to unveil its first product or content deal but says it is poised to be a leader in an emerging global multi-billion dollar “connected entertainment” market.Lars Buttler, Trion chief executive and the former head of Global Online at video game publisher Electronic Arts, says the start-up has a “unique twist”.“We build games and entertainment franchises from the ground up for the connected world,” he said.“We have built a really revolutionary technology that allows us to essentially build games that are more real time and dynamic, so we can deliver storylines on a daily basis.”The most successful online game, World of Warcraft, is also able to update its virtual universe, but Mr Buttler said this was done only every few months and Trion could react daily to what people wanted from a game.Venture capitalists DCM and Trinity Ventures, who provided initial funding a year ago, also took part in the second-round funding, which was led by Los Angeles VC firm Rustic Canyon Partners.“We think Trion has a ground-breaking – and po-tentially disruptive – model for not only creating online interactive entertainment, but also for how it will be consumed and monetised,” said Keith Titan, principal at Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments, the European company’s VC arm.
306;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-05-21T23:18:00Z;EA signs Number Nine to score goals in China;;Electronic Arts became the world’s biggest video game publisher without ever having a serious impact in Asia.That may be changing. On Monday, it announced it was taking a 15 per cent stake in The9, one of the leading online game operators in China, for $167m.EA has been unable to make an impression in China with its boxed titles due to rampant piracy. Gamers also seem to prefer playing massively-multiplayer online games in internet cafes. Vivendi’s World of Warcraft has been the only Western game to make a significant breakthrough into a market dominated by home-grown or Korean games.EA thinks it can find a paying-subscriber market in China with the help of The9 and soccer. The9 now has exclusive publishing rights for the online version of its FIFA game, EA’s biggest international sports franchise.EA is repeating its earlier strategy in Korea, where it invested $105m in the online gaming company Neowiz in March for a 19 per cent stake. Last year, it partnered with Neowiz to launch FIFA Online in Korea and the game has attracted 4.4m subscribers.“We’ve got the right business model and the delivery mechanism right [in Asia],” said John Riccitiello, EA’s new chief executive, in his first earnings conference call with analysts this month.That hasn’t been the case in the past, but partnering locally to develop its franchises for Asia and delivering them online to regular subscribers is now keeping EA “in the game”.
307;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-05-11T02:16:03Z;EA’s D’oh! moments continue;;"Electronic Arts held its summer preview of forthcoming attractions in San Francisco on Wednesday, with the announcement and demonstration of The Simpsons game taking centre stage.This is not based on the forthcoming movie. It is 8,000 lines of original dialogue from the TV show’s writers – the equivalent of three episodes.The gameplay shown was distinctly ho-hum, but it was elevated by typical Simpsons humour. The characters are aware they are in a video game and a biting parody of the industry is promised for its release in the autumn.It is good that EA, the world’s biggest video game publisher, is prepared to send itself and the industry up, but it’s own financial performance could become the subject of satire at the rate it is continuing to underperform.EA can generate huge amounts of cash from its established sports franchises such as Madden NFL and series such as The Sims, but it has suffered over the past two years from games slipping, being of middling quality and generally lacking inspiration – it has failed to come up with blockbusters of its own lately to match the Halos, Guitar Heroes and Grand Theft Autos of the gaming world.Its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday were another disappointment, but John Riccitiello, who replaced Larry Probst as chief executive last month, does seem aware of the company’s failings.He told an analyst conference call he had been called in to drive an agenda of change: ""We will focus on improving execution…my sense is that we can be faster and better focused… we’ve had some issues with predictability in our titles that we’re focused on to bring up the quality. It’s not always met our objectives,"" he admitted.He said he had enormous confidence in Spore – one EA title showing genuine inspiration and being worked on by Will Wright, the creator of The Sims. But Spore was being pushed out of current fiscal year financial planning, he said, and might still be 12 months away from release.Development of Spore began as long ago as 2000 and it was first shown at the Game Developers Conference in 2005. Despite the undoubted genius of Will Wright, the delays that EA is permitting smack of indulgence and even a little desperation about its need to prove its creative credentials.Spore could endorse them, but it may never be enough of a financial success to justify its overlong gestation."

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking.

But the market quickly recovered and closed significantly stronger than where they had been before the Fed’s announcement.“The Fed did not scare the market by sounding hawkish on inflation,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “Based on current expectations, a rate cut is still likely by the end of the year, and that’s positive for stocks.”Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones, said: “A rate cut is coming, but the Fed is biding its time and waiting for a clear peak in inflation.”At late afternoon, the S&P 500 index had closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,5012.58, led by gains in telecom, industrial and financial stocks. The index is nearing its March 2000 record close of 1,527.46.A big talking point among investors on Wednesday was Cisco as it shares slid 6.5 per cent to $26.51. The computer network operator’s fiscal third-quarter profits rose 34 per cent from the same period last year, but investors were hoping for more robust revenue guidance.“Of the 12 times the stock has opened lower on earnings since 2002, it has gone up from the open just once,” according to the Bespoke Investment Group.Cisco weighed on the Nasdaq Composite for much of on Wednesday, but the tech heavy benchmark pared losses after the FOMC meeting and closed up 0.2 per cent at at 2,576.34.Texas Instruments rose 4.7 per cent to $36.83, after the maker of phone chips raised its profit margin targets on expectations for strong revenue growth.Blue-chips benefited from the FOMC outcome and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to a new record close of 13,362.87. Honeywell, up 1.8 per cent at $56.81, and Caterpillar, up 1.8 per cent at $74.75, boosted the Dow.IBM also boosted blue chips after Goldman Sachs upgraded “Big Blue” to a “buy” from “neutral” amid the company’s plans to repurchase stock and cut costs.That reversed Goldmans’ downgrade made last week. IBM shares closed up 1.1 per cent at $104.38, after setting a 52-week high of $104.75 earlier in the morning.A drag on the Dow was Walt Disney after it reported second quarter profit rose 27 per cent, but quarterly revenue was less than expected. Shares fell 1.2 per cent to $36.12, after the stock set a six-year high of $36.57 on Tuesday.Beyond the FOMC meeting, analysts said the outlook for stocks remained positive.Mr Skrainka said “the market is still at a fair level relative to earnings,” and investors were encouraged that corporate earnings had advanced near a double-digit pace in spite of a much slower economy during the first quarter.Mr Ablin said other factors continued to support stock prices. “More than 200 companies in the S&P 500 sport a free cash flow yield in excess of the 10-year Treasury note, suggesting that the environment remains ripe for more buyouts and buybacks.”The housing market remains one of the economy’s weak spots, highlighted on Wednesday when Toll Brothers, a builder of luxury homes, warned that it would not meet recent quarterly and annual guidance. Its shares fell 0.55 per cent to $29.05.In other earnings news, News Corp reported a 6.2 per cent rise in profits for its fiscal third quarter, meeting analysts’ estimates. The media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch launched a $5bn bid for Dow Jones last week, but has been rebuffed by the Bancroft family which controls the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. News Corp was 1.65 per cent lower at $23.26 at mid-afternoon.One of the biggest movers on Wednesday was drugmaker Dendreon. The stock plunged 64.3 per cent to $6.33 after the Food and Drug Administration sought more information about its prostate cancer vaccine.Somaxon Pharmaceuticals, a speciality drugmaker, slid 11.3 per cent to $15.97, after the FDA sought details about its experimental drug to treat smoking and gambling addiction.Isis Pharmaceuticals rose 3.3 per cent to $10.24 after the drugmaker agreed to develop and market a cholesterol drug with Bristol-Myers Squibb.Shares in Electronic Arts fell 4.3 per cent to $50.65 after the video game maker reported a larger-than-forecast fiscal fourth-quarter loss.
310;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-05-08T23:23:04Z;Electronic Arts falls to larger loss;;Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video game publisher, reported a larger fourth-quarter loss after failing to produce new blockbuster titles and capitalise fully on the switch to next-generation consoles.EA said revenues of $613m for the fourth quarter to March were down 4 per cent on the $641m recorded a year earlier. It blamed declining sales of its console games. Its net loss for the quarter was $25m, up from $16m in the prior year.EA failed to anticipate the level of success of Nintendo’s Wii next-generation console, releasing only two games for its launch last November. It tried to catch up, releasing four titles in March and has been working on 15 further titles.“While we still have a way to go, we now have six Wii titles at retail,” Warren Jenson, chief financial officer, said Tuesday.Mr Jenson said EA produced 24 titles that sold more than a million copies in its fiscal year, compared with 27 titles the previous year. He indicated a further delay to EA’s most anticipated game – Spore, being developed by Will Wright, the creator of The Sims.EA had confidence in the game, he said, but decided not to include it in its financial plan for the full year.John Riccitiello, chief executive, told analysts Tuesday EA needed to increase the speed it brought titles to market and improve their quality.
311;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-04-29T22:03:16Z;MySpace hunts revenue in the ecosystem;;Peter Levinsohn, the new head of News Corp’s digital division, has every reason to be in a good mood, having just watched a presentation in which online social networking was heralded as the advertising medium of the future.The presentation, by Marketing Evolution, a market research firm, extolled social networking’s ability to create a viral “momentum effect” for brands. It suggested social networking was more effective for advertisers than television as it creates more engagement between individual brands and consumers.With MySpace one of the companies under Mr Levinsohn’s wing, this is positive news for News Corp. “Advertisers used to say: ‘why MySpace?’. Now it’s: ‘how MySpace?’,” he says in his first interview since becoming head of Fox Interactive Media six months ago.Adidas and Electronic Arts are among the companies to have launched branded viral marketing campaigns on MySpace. Branded clips, online wallpaper and other features can be pasted on to personal pages and passed around within the MySpace community.The success of such campaigns has changed MySpace’s revenue mix. A year ago, 70 per cent of the site’s advertising income came from “performance” or click-through advertising, with the rest coming from branded advertising. In the past few months that ratio has reversed, with branded advertising now accounting for 70 per cent.The group has doubled its advertising sales force to more than 200 people since the start of the year to manage this growth. “We took a very small sales organisation and built it into a first-class sales organisation and in doing so have really strengthened our relationships with advertisers.“We build these custom communities within the MySpace ecosystem. And the more integrated they are, the more we can charge advertisers.”News Corp, which bought MySpace in 2005 for $580m, also owns AmericanIdol.com and IGN, a site for video gamers. MySpace, though, is the largest business in the division, and is five months into a three-year search deal with Google worth $900m.The deal has yet to be fully signed off, though. “We have a good relationship [with Google],” says Mr Levinsohn. “We are working on signing a long form document and whatever issues we have with them we expect to be worked out.”When Mr Levinsohn replaced his cousin Ross as president of FIM, his appointment came amid a spending spree by News Corp on online businesses as it sought to beef up its internet division.Reports at the time of the appointment suggested Mr Levinsohn would concentrate on operations rather than doing deals, as his predecessor had done. This, he says, is not entirely right: deals remain a priority. “Any type of technology that will help us to monetise the site better is something that we will be very aggressive in pursuing.”The group will also “aggressively pursue” companies that “help us create a better experience” for users. It recently acquired Strategic Data Corporation, a Santa Monica-based technology company that specialises in sending targeted advertisements to niche audiences on the web.“We have more data about our users than any other network,” says Mr Levinsohn. “Ultimately, we will be able to effectively target the advertising on the site. You will be sent an ad that you will be more likely to click on and respond to.”
312;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-04-13T19:43:29Z;Fallout from console wars;;War, what is it good for? The cynical answer is suppliers’ profits, particularly if they are backing the winner. That certainly holds true in the never-ending battle for the hearts, thumbs and wallets of video gamers. Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo have a lot riding on the success of the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii consoles, respectively. But so do the game developers behind them.The big four US game developers – Electronic Arts, Activision, THQ and Take-Two Interactive Software – have a combined market capitalisation of $26bn. Unlike the last phase of the console wars, in which Sony’s PlayStation 2 took an early lead that it never lost, the outcome this time is uncertain. What is clear is that the PS3, which is both late to the market and relatively expensive, looks unlikely to take the 69 per cent market share enjoyed by its predecessor. As of December, its share was an estimated 10 per cent.The issue for games developers is whether the Xbox 360 or the Wii will be the main beneficiary. The Wii’s success to date has some negative implications for them. Nintendo develops a larger proportion of its games in-house and independent developers tend to make less money in terms of sales per console. Research house 2K Advisors calculates that, for example, Electronic Arts made about $39 in sales per Nintendo console between 2000 and 2006. The corresponding figures for Sony’s and Microsoft’s hardware were $60 and $73, respectively.Electronic Arts and Take-Two must hope the Xbox 360 benefits most from the PS3’s apparently weak start. Activision is more balanced but would still benefit more from the Xbox 360 doing well. On 2K’s calculations, only THQ appears agnostic to the outcome, with similar sales per console across all platforms. That would make it the natural choice for investors who do not feel confident enough to second-guess the geeks.
313;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-04-08T21:20:03Z;Game creators at risk from talent drain;;Britain’s computer games industry is in danger of losing out to competition from Canada and Australia as countries vie to attract talented developers.In the latest sign that the UK is losing its hold, SCi Entertainment, the country’s biggest games publisher and owner of the blockbuster Lara Croft Tomb Raider franchise, is to open a studio of 210 developers in ­Montreal.Many in the industry think the government should be doing more to support the burgeoning games industry. According to Tiga, the trade association for UK games developers, the number of independent studios has shrunk from about 400 in 2001 to just 150 today.The Tomb Raider titles – which celebrate their tenth anniversary this year – are now developed in California. Hitman, another blockbuster series for the company, is made in Denmark. Once SCi’s Montreal studios are fully staffed, only about one-fifth of the company’s more than 800 developers will be based in the UK.For further expansion Jane Cavanagh, chief executive, said she was looking at locations such as China rather than Britain. “The UK still has a good talent base, but other places are making a concerted effort to draw talent,” she said.Montreal is offering to pay about 40 per cent of the salaries of the SCi developers and to give them a tax holiday for three years. Such grants have also enticed global publishers, such as Electronic Arts of the US and Ubisoft of France, to set up in the city.In Australia, the state government of Victoria is setting up incentives, such as providing A$375,000 (£156,000) over two years to help fund local games development, attracting Atari of France and THQ of the US to the region.Ms Cavanagh said the UK should consider giving tax breaks to games companies, as it does to the film industry. UK Trade and Investment, the government body responsible for helping businesses locate in the UK, is understood to be examining the issue, with a report due before the summer.“The UK has a fabulous track record for creating genre-defining games and it would be very easy to rest on our laurels and say look at Lara Croft and Grand Theft Auto,” said Rick Gibson, an independent games analyst at Games Investor Consulting.“But the market for games development is getting increasingly competitive, with the advent of major government intervention in places like Quebec and ­Victoria.”The UK’s independent games developers have long been under pressure from the cost of producing games for new consoles. Creating a game for the latest and most sophisticated consoles – Sony’s PlayStation 3 and Microsoft’s XBox 360 – takes a team of 75 to 100 developers compared with about 30 for previous platforms.A number of British development studios, such as Argo­naut and Warthog, have gone out of business in the past few years.Others have been taken over by large foreign-owned organisations such as ­Microsoft, which bought Peter Molyneux’s Lionhead Studios.UK developers still create groundbreaking games. For example, Singstar, the karaoke game for the Sony PlayStation, was created in London. But the game’s development team was part of Sony and the intellectual property belongs to the Japanese company.Increased foreign ownership could make the UK industry vulnerable, warned Fred Hasson, chief executive of Tiga. “People are beginning to question the skills base of the UK and the cost of being here. EA and Take 2, for example, have recently moved their European headquarters from the UK to Switzerland,” he said.Shaun Woodward, the creative industries minister, has said he is looking at ways to support the ­industry, including the creation of a national “academy for geeks” to train people for the games sector. He also wants to encourage venture capital funding of games companies.
314;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-04-03T04:53:16Z;Rock and role-playing;;Video game publishers seem intent on rocking your world.In a clear attempt to one-up Activision’s success with Guitar Hero, Electronic Arts has announced it will launch the Rock Band game on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles this November.Guitar Hero features a plastic guitar accessory that has buttons in place of frets. Gamers can strum with one hand and play the frets with the other while trying to play an on-screen score accurately.It has sold over 2m copies and boosted Activision’s results in the last holiday season after it acquired Guitar Hero’s publisher Red Octane.Guitar Hero’s developer is Harmonix, which is partnering with MTV and EA on the new Rock Band game. Players will be able to choose from drum, bass guitar, lead guitar and microphone peripherals and the music they will be playing along to will feature master recordings rather than cover versions of songs like Lynyrd Skynyrd’s Free Bird.The official announcement does not mention any online element to the game but this seems sure to be part of it. This would mirror a trend of musicians collaborating online including contributing different parts of songs to sites such as YouTube.It also follows on from the success of karaoke and dancing video games. In February, EA bought SingShot Media, an online karaoke website it plans to integrate into a number of its online services.Rock Band is yet another riff on music in games for EA – it announced last month it was setting up its own real-world record label – Artwerk – and would launch Boogie -a dancing game that would take advantage of the Nintendo Wii’s motion-sensing controller.
315;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Online extras drive computer games market;;As Sony launches its PlayStation 3 games machine on to the European market, it is clear a that key factor in the console wars is what the machines can do online.This month Sony unveiled with great fanfare Home, an online 3-D world where PS3 users can design a character, furnish a room for it, chat with other players and buy music, films and games.The company is keen for gamers to log on to its online Play­Station Network and is offering free copies of the Blu-Ray disc of Casino Royale to the first 500,000 to sign up. It is also issuing an upgrade to machines that makes downloading games easier.Sony is attempting to catch up with Microsoft, on whose Xbox Live online service users can buy games, chat with others and play against them. The site boasts 6m users.Nintendo’s Wii also has an online portal that offers web chat, news, weather reports and games to download.Console companies are connecting their machines to the internet to grab a share of an internet gaming bonanza from which the PC games market has benefited.“Casual” internet gamers – particularly older women who enjoy playing short puzzles and logic games online – have been identified as a fast-growing new games market.Revenues from casual games worldwide totalled $953m ($1.9bn) in 2006, up from $713m in 2005 and $228m in 2002, according to estimates by the research group DFC Intelligence.In addition, online multiplayer role-playing games have started to become mainstream. These have been popular in Asia for several years, but figures from Screen Digest this week showed that the market for so-called “massively multiplayer online games” outside Asia hit $1bn for the first time in 2006.Much of this growth is down to a single product, World of Warcraft, a fantasy role-playing game by Blizzard Entertainment, a division of Vivendi Games. The game has more than 8m paying customers and generated revenues of $471m last year.Vivendi is looking at bringing out more online multiplayer games, starting with Freestyle Street Basketball, which allows people to challenge each other to basketball games online.Electronic Arts, the world’s largest games publisher, is jumping on the bandwagon. This week the company announced plans to buy a 19 per cent stake in Neowiz, a Korea-based online gaming company, for $105m. EA partnered with Neowiz last year to put its Fifa football game online and saw huge uptake, with more than 4.4m registered subscribers to date.“That’s almost 10 per cent of the population of South Korea,” says Gerhard Florin, head of EA’s international operations. “These are unbelievable numbers. Five years ago the Asian online market was not there, but it was estimated to be worth $2.5bn in 2005.”EA is looking to launch other online games with Neowiz and hopes to bring the model to Europe.Others are also investing. Last month in the UK Virgin Games and Game Domain International announced plans to create an “iTunes” for the games market, an online platform that would allow games from a number of publishers to be downloaded quickly.Console makers are keen not to miss out. Phil Harrison, head of Sony’s worldwide games studios, sees selling games online as a way to reach new consumers who do not frequent games retail stores.He also sees it as a way to generate new revenues from advertising. Advertisements can be placed within online games themselves as well as in the Home 3-D space.“Our user-base is an elusive band that is not watching network television,” Mr Harrison says. “The response from advertisers has been phenomenal. Unexpected brands have been beating our door down.”Above all, the online services have become a way for consoles manufacturers to differentiate their products in a tough market.Getting exclusive games used to be a key part of the battle between consoles, but exclusives are now rare. The cost of developing games for the new consoles has doubled to about $15m-$20m, and games publishers accordingly want to hedge their bets by releasing games on multiple platforms.Instead of exclusive games, console makers are creating exclusive “online” extras. Microsoft, for example, is releasing extra content for the popular Grand Theft Auto racing game that can be found only on the Xbox Live service.“In today’s world, exclusives will be reduced,” says Neil Thompson, head of Microsoft’s Xbox division in northern and eastern Europe. “More and more it is the online aspect that will drive differentiation.”
316;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-03-07T05:27:40Z;Emotiv pioneers new mind games;;A device that can read thoughts and emotions will be unveiled at a developers’ conference on Wednesday as a new way of playing video games.Emotiv, a start-up company with offices in San Francisco and Sydney, Australia, will demonstrate a headset that uses sensors to tap into electrical waves from the brain.They can sense levels of excitement and tell if a person is smiling, angry, winking or raising their eyebrows.The Game Developers Conference in San Francisco will also be shown how gamers can use the power of thought to move objects around.The aim is to persuade them to adapt games they develop to take advantage of the new device, which will go on sale next year.In a pre-launch demonstration to the Financial Times, Emotiv showed how Electronic Arts’ Harry Potter and the Goblets of Fire could be adapted so that a player could use the headset to lift, push and rotate objects and cast spells.The software needs to be first trained in the player’s thought processes and electrical reactions from the brain as they imagine pushing, lifting and turning objects.Randy Breen, chief product officer and a former executive at EA and LucasArts, said the software code could be added to a game late in the development process without impacting on its budget. “If emotions can become a central element, I think it’s easy to see how video games can appeal to a broader audience, especially women,” he said.
317;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-02-13T18:07:08Z;Singing games make a noise;;The sixth season of Fox’s hugely successful American Idol TV show is underway, with the contest proper starting tonight in Hollywood where 24 semi-finalists will be chosen.This follows a month of televised auditions, notable for some extraordinary examples of awful singing, ridiculous dance routines and laughable costumes.Much like your average karaoke bar, you might think, and Fox could have saved a lot of money touring the country by using instead kSolo, the online karaoke service it bought last year, to weed out the most entertaining singers.It has yet to integrate kSolo into American Idol and one wonders what Electronic Arts will do with San Francisco-based SingShot Media, another online karaoke service that it announced it was acquiring yesterday.SingShot will be part of The Sims division and EA said its technology and user-generated content would be applied to several different community projects within the company.Video game publishers clearly want to extend into the online world and also see big money in titles that allow gamers to act out fantasies beyond being marines, space warriors, speedsters or sportsmen.Activision’s acquisition of the company that makes Guitar Hero, the ideal game for air guitarists, helped it to a record holiday quarter. The consoles already have Sony’s SingStar karaoke game and Konami’s Dance Dance Revolution and Karaoke Revolution for hoofers and crooners.Sales of music and dance games made up less than 5 per cent of the US market in 2006, according to NPD, but they rose 80 per cent on the previous year.
318;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-02-07T17:19:32Z;The Half-Life of video-game names;;Sometimes the marketing moves of the video games industry beggar understanding.An announcement by Electronic Arts this morning left me scratching my head as hard as when Nintendo decided last year to call its new console the Wii instead of sticking to its original choice, the Revolution.That one grew on me a bit but I have yet to work out the logic of calling EA’s latest action game titles, The Orange Box and The Black Box.Orange boxes I associate with something you stand on to get a better view or to store stuff under the sink in. Black boxes are aircraft flight recorders (although they happen to be bright orange).Action game titles should be called something like Medal of Duty or Metroid Halo Gears of Destruction.But EA “today announced the naming and product configurations The Black Box and The Orange Box, two of the most anticipated action game offerings shipping worldwide in Fall 2007.”The Black Box, just for PC gamers, contains Half-Life 2: Episode Two, a new action game Portal and Team Fortress 2. The Orange Box, for the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 includes The Black Box’s content, plus the original Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2: Episode One.I suppose it will soon become a cool code among gamers – Are you getting the Black or the Orange? – but as names go, only The White Box could top these for minimalism.
319;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2007-02-02T00:00:18Z;EA to raise its support for Wii;;Electronic Arts, the world’s largest video games publisher, is to raise substantially its support for Nintendo’s Wii games console, which has been outselling Sony’s PlayStation 3.The quality of video game content available is a deciding factor in the console wars. Larry Probst, EA chief executive, announced the boost for the Nintendo product yesterday in a report of EA’s third-quarter earnings.“In the year ahead, we plan to build on our leadership position on both the Xbox 360 and the Play­Station 3, and to significantly increase our support for the Nintendo platforms,” Mr Probst said.EA released only two Wii titles in its busiest quarter ending December 31, during which both the Wii and PS3 were launched. Four games were released for the PS3 and five for the Xbox 360. EA said it was working on 15 new Wii games.Nintendo said last week it had sold 3.19m consoles worldwide by year end, including 1.25m in North America. Microsoft sold 4.4m Xbox 360s in the last quarter worldwide, while Sony shipped 1m PS3s to the US, although industry data suggested not all had been sold.EA said it had grabbed a 32 per cent share of the small PS3 market in its third quarter, but did not provide figures for the Wii.It reported revenues of $1.281bn, up one per cent on the year, ahead of analysts’ expected $1.263bn. Earnings per share of 63 cents were down from 86 cents a year ago, ahead of Wall Street expectations of 57 cents.EA shares were up 4 per cent in after-hours trading at $52.55.
320;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-12-02T18:32:45Z;The Tech Grinch’s Christmas List: No. 9 Halo 3;;"The countdown resumes on our Tech Grinch’s Xmas List of the many things you won’t be able to enjoy this Christmas:
9. Halo 3 – The most that Master Chief fans can expect to see of this Microsoft video game this Christmas is the new 60-second trailer showing in the breaks during the next Monday Night Football in the US and on Xbox.com and Xbox Live Marketplace thereafter. The biggest fans will also have the chance from Monday of registering for the public beta programme for Halo 3, which will begin in the spring. The games industry is coy about delays and some games may be pushed back for genuine reasons around timing. But Microsoft had to get out Gears of War as a Halo substitute to combat the launch of the PS3 and its Resistance: Fall of Man game. Gears sold 1m copies in its first two weeks. Sony is waiting on some big ones as well – such as the successor to Gran Turismo 4 and the high definition online version intended for this month but postponed this week. The next major Grand Theft Auto is still in the works and Will Wright’s long-awaited Spore is still being spawned by Electronic Arts. If you just bought a new quad-core gaming PC for the latest games for four brains – sorry, none available right now. But look out for Supreme Commander, a dual-screen military strategy game, in the New Year.

321;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-10-13T18:03:21Z;Take-Two’s ‘Bully’ game goes before judge;;Take-Two, publisher of the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, is having its latest game reviewed by a judge in Florida to determine if it can be sold to minors.The game, Bully, is due to be released on Tuesday on the PlayStation2 games console and allows players to take the role of a troublesome schoolboy taking on bullies and teachers at a crumbling prep school, the Bullworth Academy.Jack Thompson, a crusader against video game violence, filed a complaint in Florida against Take-Two and retailers Wal-Mart and Gamestop, alleging the game was a “Columbine simulator” – a reference to the 1999 school massacre in Colorado – despite the fact it does not feature any guns or killings.He is seeking a pre-emptive ban on the sale of the game in the state and wants its rating raised from “T”, which is for children 13 years and older.The judge has ordered Take-Two employees to play Bully in front of him – a process that could take up to 40 hours to complete the game.Bully is another product of Take-Two’s Rockstar Games, whose studios produced Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. It was pulled from retailers’ shelves last year after a hidden sex scene was discovered.Sales of Bully elsewhere in the US may benefit from the publicity and Take-Two shares were 1.75 per cent higher in midday trading in New York.Shares of Electronic Arts, Activision and THQ were also higher on the back of strong September sales of video games in the US, according to the NPD research company.Software and hardware sales were up 29 per cent and 70 per cent respectively on a year earlier.Electronic Arts, the world’s largest video game publisher, saw a 16 per cent year-on-year increase in sales in September helped by a 16 per cent rise in sales over the previous month of its latest Madden NFL football game.Elizabeth Osur, video games analyst at Citigroup, attributed the rise to a weak September 2005 and strong demand for games for the Nintendo DS handheld console, the PlayStation2 and Xbox 360.Nintendo’s DS sold 403,000 units, well ahead of the Sony PSP handheld console at 153,000 units.More than 250,000 units of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 were sold for total sales of 2.7m in the US since its launch in November 2005, giving it a substantial installed base ahead of the release of Sony and Nintendo’s next-generation consoles in November.
322;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-09-20T13:51:45Z;Wall Street dips on mix of negative news;;Wall Street finished lower on Tuesday as investor confidence was soured by data showing a precipitous drop in housing starts, a warning on profits from internet group Yahoo, and news of a possible coup in Thailand.Yahoo slumped 11.2 per cent to $25.75, erasing eight weeks of gains, after its chief financial officer said the company’s quarterly results would be at the bottom end of a previously forecast range, due to slowing advertising demand.The news also dragged down other internet stocks. Google shed 2.6 per cent to $403.81, and Ebay sank 3.3 per cent to $25.95.Crude oil prices tumbled, as high inventories helped ease supply worries. The front-month Nymex contract lost 3.2 per cent to $61.66 a barrel, its biggest single day decline since May. Valero slid 4.3 per cent to $50.10, and Devon Energy lost 3.8 per cent to $64.32.Mining stocks were also hurt by falls in copper and gold prices. Barrick Gold sank 4.1 per cent to $28.76, and Freeport McMoran also slipped 4.1 per cent to $51.26.Semiconductor group Maxim Integrated Products lowered its revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal first quarter due to sluggish orders. Its shares fell 4.9 per cent to $29.84. The stock has fallen 17 per cent since the start of the year.Time Warner announced that its strategy of not charging its AOL broadband subscribers access fees was succeeding in attracting new internet users.

331;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-05-30T17:40:03Z;Games move to a new level;;Video games have started offering “sandbox” or “open world” experiences where players can choose any number of entry and exit points in a game and wander to their heart’s content.It is an advance on the traditional linear, well-plotted format, where gamers work their way from one level to the next until they reach the ultimate stage, complete their tasks and win.Silicon Valley-based Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest publisher, has worked on three open world games recently – “The Godfather”, “Superman Returns” and “Medal of Honor” – where players can choose to parachute themselves into combat anywhere in the world.All three games have been behind schedule, reflecting the problems of adding this complexity.Taking it to the next level might be an appropriate headline for the industry as a whole right now, except there are stronger parallels of entering a daunting open world where new directions are being taken by the games and the platforms that power them.Finding my way around this month’s E3 – a labyrinthine Los Angeles trade show of Hollywood-style sets, banks of consoles, big screens and booming rock music – was a similar journey of discovery.The presentations of the three major console manufacturers – Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo – revealed divergent paths for the next-generation machines.In the current cycle, the PlayStation2, Xbox and GameCube have been gaming consoles pure and simple, although the first two also allow users to play DVDs and the Xbox introduced an online gaming service.Of their successors – PlayStation3, Xbox 360 and Wii, which will be competing with one another by the end of this year – only the Wii can be described as totally focused on the gaming experience.The Wii’s big selling point is its motion-sensing controller with built-in “force-feedback” and sound, a stroke of genius, according to Bobby Kotick, chief executive of games publisher Activision.He was hooked when he tried a fishing game. Casting a line by waving the controller, you experience it hitting the water, then bobbing, feel the fish nibbling, and sense the pull as you reel it in.The longest lines at E3 were gamers waiting to try out the Wii controller. “I think the Wii is one of the most well differentiated products I’ve ever seen,” Mr Kotick told me.Nintendo’s differentiation strategy may be a case of necessity being the mother of invention, however, with Nintendo unable to compete with Sony and Microsoft in the “arms race” of next-generation high-definition graphics and blazing processing power. Sony may have won that race with the PS3’s nine-core processor and Blu-ray DVD drive, but it will be the most expensive console. Sony’s strategy seems a long-term one of winning the battle for the best digital product in the home, leveraging the console to outsell its rival Toshiba’s HD-DVD machines and matching the performance of the PS3 to that of its high-definition TVs.For Microsoft’s 360, the power is in the network. Its Xbox Live service now has a marketplace for merchandise and game add-ons, an arcade for playing casual games and, with Live Anywhere announced at the show, console gamers will be able to play friends on PCs and mobile phones.Indeed, the PC is becoming a fourth console. Xbox 360 controllers plug into PCs and work the same way and, with the demanding graphics standards being built into Windows Vista, next year’s new operating system, the gaming experience is likely to be similar if not superior.This breaking out of consoles into new areas and their expanding capabilities present challenges for publishers designing games for them, but the fact that they are each very different machines in this generation should help in growing the market and demographic of game players.In this cycle of fragmentation, publishers also have the added complexity of how to address other gaming opportunities that hardly existed at the start of the last cycle.The handheld segment has expanded with the addition of the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS – the dual-screen portable that offers much different functionality than its Game Boy consoles.Mobile phones are also becoming a platform for games – initially of the casual variety, but now becoming more sophisticated.The overarching online opportunity is intriguing. Advertising and social networks are being created as players meet, share and play over the internet.With Xbox Live expected to have 6m users in a year’s time and the World of Warcraft online role-playing game already passing 5m subscribers worldwide, there are brave new virtual worlds out there for the industry to explore.
332;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-05-22T17:11:39Z;When you have just 17 minutes to play with;;Alex St John knew he had a hit even before WildTangent, his computer games company, released its adventure featuring animals escaping from a zoo.Penguins!, in which the flightless birds ascend 100 levels of difficulty in a dash for freedom, took just six months and $135,000 to develop using one software engineer and two designers. It was profitable before it even launched this month, thanks to an advertising sponsorship deal with ­Nissan.It is selling for $20 as an online download or for a few cents for single sessions of play over the web, where it will attract more advertising. Consumers buying new PCs will be offered the chance to play it through a pre-installed virtual games console. “It will ship on all Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba computers this Christmas, so it will reach 20m consumer computers sold in the next 12 months and it will generate millions in revenue from advertising and sales. No existing game model performs in this way,” says Mr St John, chief executive of Seattle-based WildTangent.The company is focusing on casual games, the fastest growing segment of the games industry, according to IDC, the research group, which forecasts growth from $500m in 2004 to $2.1bn in 2008. It is a sector of very high margins and very low risk, says Mr St John, especially compared with the high-risk, low-margin world of next-generation console games, where development costs can be double those of the previous generation.“Casual games used to be regarded as something of a joke where the audience was just middle-aged housewives who liked to play bingo,” says Paul Jackson, analyst with Forrester Research. “But they are now the focus of a lot of people’s attention, because they are creating great incremental revenues.”Mr St John, who founded WildTangent in 1998, pursued male hard-core gamers through titles such as Blaster Ball, before realising there was a wider audience. “Casual gaming turns out to be a behaviour rather than a demographic,” he says. “It’s people playing games to relax and take a break rather than get all jacked up and stimulate themselves – as your traditional hard-core gamers are doing. The average casual gaming session online is 17 minutes.”In San Francisco, PlayFirst, a casual gaming start-up, has grown from two people to 34 in two years. It has just released Diner Dash 2, the follow-up to Diner Dash, the biggest hit of 2005. More than 100m people worldwide have helped heroine Flo wait on tables and build a restaurant empire while dealing with difficult customers.PlayFirst commissioned the game from a small developer in New York and sees itself as a publisher assembling a portfolio of games and developers it can nurture by helping with marketing, distribution and common technologies. It has also attracted talent including a lead engineer from Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video game publisher. “At EA, he would be part of a massive team. Here he gets a lot of input into the design and is doing the entire game,” says John Welch, PlayFirst chief executive.Casual gamers’ ability to expand the demographic has won interest from leading video games publishers seeking new growth areas. THQ laun­ched a casual games site, SlingDot.com, last month, a venture similar to EA’s advertising-sponsored Pogo.com and Club Pogo, which has more than 1.25m paying subscribers.Nintendo has brought out sophisticated casual games such as Nintendogs, a pet care project, and Brain Age, a challenging maths game. Increasing numbers of handheld consoles, including Sony’s PSP, have provided another platform for casual games.Microsoft may be the best placed of all to benefit. About 13m people a month play casual games on its MSN website and 16m more do so through its instant messaging product. The Xbox 360 console has an online Arcade option to play casual games and this month Microsoft announced an expansion into games on mobile phones. Bill Gates, Microsoft’s chairman, told the E3 games industry show this month that all the platforms would be tied together under its Live Anywhere strategy, so players on PCs could take on Xbox console owners in online games.Chris Early, studio manager of Microsoft Casual Games, says: “With Live Anywhere, we’re creating a new ecosystem across all of these for our partners and developers.”Casual games are well suited to this environment and Microsoft’s cut of revenues can be compared to what happens in the casino games it currently offers – the house always wins.
333;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-05-11T21:07:27Z;EA looks to spend its way through time of transition;;In a games industry becoming fragmented by different console generations and the growth of mobile, handheld and online gaming, Electronic Arts is the only company with the arsenal to take on all the risks and opportunities of the new landscape.EA, the world’s biggest games publisher, announced this month it would increase its research and development spending by 15-20 per cent this fiscal year to around $900m.The aim is to spend through the console transition, a difficult period for the games industry, to give it global leadership on next-generation consoles as well as online and mobile platforms in the next few years.“I don’t think there’s another company in the industry that is playing on more different fronts or platforms than EA,” said Larry Probst, chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times at the video games industry’s E3 show in Los Angeles. “We’ve got a strong balance sheet and we’ve got the scale where we think we can do that successfully. Longer term, we think that’s going to be a pretty significant competitive advantage for us.”EA has forecast it could fall into a loss this fiscal year as it spends for the future and console game revenues slip. Consumers are losing interest in the current generation of games and not enough of the new machines are going to be available. But it has $2.4bn in cash or equivalents on hand to back its investments in new areas.“I think [the transition] is taking a little longer this time because you’ve got this staggered roll-out of new hardware,” Mr Probst said.“There are just more platforms to be addressed with the new consoles, handheld devices, cellphones, casual games and all the online opportunities happening in Asia and other parts of the world – it’s more complex this time.”With next-generation games more expensive to build, EA plans to exploit its properties across the different platforms to make their development more economic. Its acquisition of the Jamdat mobile games company will allow it to distribute simple casual games on the PC, consoles and handheld devices as well.There will also be a focus on producing original games in order to avoid the high licensing fees that reduce margins.“Historically, we’ve always been good at executing strategy, so we’re pretty confident we’re going to be in a good position on all of these platforms going forward,” Mr Probst said.
334;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
335;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-05-07T17:47:39Z;Microsoft racing ahead in consoles war;;If the race to dominate the next generation of consoles were a three-car video game, Microsoft would be completing its first lap with rivals Sony and Nintendo stalled on the grid.Sony will show a final version of its PlayStation 3 in Los Angeles this week at E3, the industry’s biggest trade show, while Nintendo is expected to unveil its Wii console.But neither product is expected to go on sale until November, giving Microsoft’s Xbox 360 a year’s lead that could prove unassailable.“We think that Microsoft is in a position to take the lead, materially, in the fifth-generation game console fight,” said Merrill Lynch analysts in a report last week.They expect more than 12m Xboxes to ship in this calendar year and Microsoft to have 47 per cent of the market by the middle of the new console cycle in 2008, with Sony taking 33 per cent and Nintendo 20 per cent.That would be a sharp reversal for Sony, now dominating the market with a 64 per cent share against Microsoft’s 16 per cent.Microsoft is promising aggressive investment in the Xbox 360 over the next 12 months to maintain its lead and, at E3, will preview its Halo 3 game – a key title that should bolster its console sales as Sony enters the market.“Microsoft smells blood in the water,” said Bill Watkins, chief executive of Seagate Technology, which has been in talks with Sony about including its hard drive in the PS3.Sony can take some comfort from booming sales of its PlayStationPortable handheld device and the continuing strength of the PlayStation 2, reportedly showing a sales increase of about 25 per cent since the price in the US fell from $149 to $129.Nintendo is stronger in handhelds with its Game Boy Advance and Dual Screen consoles, but Microsoft is thought to be preparing its own entry into this market.For software publishers, the move to high-definition technology means higher development costs and lower sales initially as few consumers can get hold of the new consoles and the rest begin to lose interest in current-generation machines.US console software sales fell 12 per cent last year and could fall another 12 per cent this year to $4.1bn, according to forecasts by PiperJaffray analysts. But these analysts predict sales will be 36 per cent higher at $5.6bn in 2008.“There are some short-term challenges as we manage the transition,” says Neil Young, general manager of the LA studios of Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest publisher. “But when you reach that [mid-cycle] point, you’re back into the Golden Age.”Shares in Electronic Arts fell to a 52-week low last week after it said it was spending its way through an uncertain phase to the detriment of profits as it tried to ensure continued leadership.
336;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-05-05T20:59:16Z;Wall Street rally helped by easing oil prices;;Wall Street made strong advances this week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a fresh six-year high – to bring it within about 150 points of its all-time record – while the S&P 500 reached its highest level in five years. The Russell 2000 index of small companies reached an all-time high.Robust gains in materials and transport outweighed mixed economic data and disappointing earnings in software and healthcare.The week had an inauspicious start after CNBC revealed that Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, felt markets had misinterpreted his congressional testimony as being dovish on interest rates. Markets briefly panicked, pushing the leading indices down.However, continued solid earnings and an easing in the crude price to its lowest level in a month were enough to perk up Wall Street.The markets were also largely cheered by the week’s economic news. Fears of further monetary tightening eased thanks to figures showing an increase in productivity and a fall in non-farm payrolls.“Investors are cheering the top line numbers in employment and not paying attention to the fact that wages are up,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach, who was still nervous about the fact that oil, bond yields, gold and equities were all moving higher. “The market is focusing on the fact that the economy is still quite strong. We have all four markets going up, and somewhere along the line, something is going to give.”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 had gained 1 per cent to 1,325.76 on the day, up 1.2 per cent for the week, its highest level since February 2001. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8 per cent at 2,342.57 on the day, up 0.9 per cent on the week. The Dow was at 11,577.74, up 1.2 per cent on the day and 1.9 per cent on the week.The materials sector was a star performer, with demand for steel and base metals fuelling upgrades. Nucor added 7.6 per cent for the week to $117.05 after an upgrade from Merrill Lynch, while US Steel gained 9.6 per cent to $75.10. Shares in both have doubled since October 2005, thanks to deal talk.Falling inventories helped copper prices to record highs. These supply constraints sent copper miner Phelps Dodge soaring 9.2 per cent to $94.15, and was upgraded by Bear Stearns. It has risen over 40 per cent since March.Transport was also strong. The Dow Jones Transportation index touched an all-time high, and at one point was up 5.9 per cent for the week. The index has gained 16.5 per cent since the start of the year.Freight shipper Expeditors International soared 24.5 per cent to $106.55, after it raised its dividend and reported earnings per share 20 per cent higher than analysts had forecast.Rail-freight carriers also gained, thanks to increased pricing power and growing imports from China. CSX rose 8.3 per cent to $74.19 on the week and Burlington Northern Santa Fe rose 4.6 per cent to $83.19.Software was one of the worst performing sectors: the S&P software index fell 2.3 per cent on the week.Microsoft continued its slide, losing 4 per cent before a slight recovery. It is down 12.7 per cent since releasing its earnings last week. Online auctioneer eBay lost 5 per cent on Friday - the second worst performance on the S&P 500 - and 5.6 per cent for the week.Adobe Systems, makers of graphic design software, slumped on Wednesday after it said second-quarter revenue and profits would come in at the lower end of its forecasts. It fell 12.8 per cent over the week to $34.18.Electronic Arts fell after its revenues and earnings forecasts fell short of market expectations. The shares fell 15.8 per cent to $47.85, their lowest since November 2004.The healthcare sector remained poorly. Cigna reported sharply lower first quarter profits and the company’s shares fell 14.1 per cent to $91.88. Aetna lost 1.3 per cent to $37.99.One of the biggest fallers was Procter & Gamble, whose forecast for the current quarter was below analysts’ forecasts. It fell 4.3 per cent for the week to $55.73.The NYSE Group rose 3.3 per cent to $68.60 on speculation that it would beat Nasdaq for control of the LSE. NYSE gained 9 per cent on Friday, in reaction to its successful secondary equity offering, which frees it to bid for other exchanges.
337;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-05-05T18:57:44Z;THQ forecasts wider loss than expected;;THQ on Friday forecast a larger loss than expected in its first quarter as video game publishers continued to report a painful transition to next-generation consoles.Earlier this week, Electronic Arts predicted it could swing to a loss in the current financial year and Activision said revenues could fall 30 per cent.THQ said its first quarter to the end of June should show sales of $125m and a loss of around 21 cents a share, excluding equity-based compensation. Market expectations were for a profit of 2 cents and sales of $199.5m, according to Thomson First Call.THQ’s biggest release of the quarter will be Cars, a game version of the new Pixar animated movie due to be released in US cinemas on June 9. But executives said its effect on revenues would not be strong initially, with sales expected to be spread out as the movie opens in other territories and versions of the game for next-generation consoles are released later in the year.Video game publishers are suffering from falling prices and interest in games for current generation consoles, while they are unable to sell games in large numbers for next-generation ones as the market is still small. Microsoft released its Xbox 360 only last November and Sony’s PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii are expected to launch in November this year.THQ warned two weeks ago that its fourth quarter ending in March would show a loss of around 13 cents on revenues of $150m due to the poor performance of its current-generation Full Spectrum Warrior: Ten Hammers game and a change in strategy for its wrestling franchise.On Friday, it reported the loss was 12 cents a share on revenues of $148.1m. Its shares were up 3.5 per cent at $25.21 in midday trading in New York.
338;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-05-03T22:50:38Z;EA might suffer loss as it spends on new formats;;Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video games maker, forecast on Wednesday it could swing to a loss in its next financial year as it continued to spend to try to dominate new platforms.At the same time, its rival Activision announced it had wrested a key franchise from EA, winning the exclusive rights to James Bond games until 2014. EA shares fell more than 5 per cent in after-hours trading to $51.70.The Silicon Valley-based company reported a loss of $16m, or 5 cents a share, in its fourth quarter ending March 31, although sales rose 16 per cent to $641m, from $553m a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenues of $581m, according to a consensus gathered by Thomson First Call.Profits for the year were $236m, or 75 cents a share, down from $504m, or $1.59. Revenues were down 6 per cent to $2.951bn.EA had fewer million-selling titles in the year and suffered as consumers slowed spending on games for current-generation consoles in anticipation of the arrival of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 last November and the forthcoming Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii next-generation machines.“This transition is more than a console upgrade,” Larry Probst, chief executive, said. “EA is positioning for global leadership in online, handhelds and mobile phones.”That will require greater investment, and EA said its research and development costs would be 15 to 20 per cent higher in fiscal 2007 than the $758m spent last year.While it forecast revenues would be flat to down about 10 per cent at $2.7bn to $2.95bn, it predicted a substantially lower earnings range of between a profit of 15 cents and a loss of 15 cents.“We continue to invest ahead of revenues for long-term leadership,” Warren Jenson, chief financial officer, said.“We are well into the console transition and now have more than 30 next-generation games in development.”Activision’s new deal for James Bond takes effect immediately.MGM Interactive and Eon Productions, which own the James Bond franchise, said they were awarding Activision worldwide rights to create video games for all current and next-generation consoles as well as PC and handheld platforms.Activision, which has successfully developed games from the Spiderman movie franchise, is likely to base its first game on the latest Bond film, Casino Royale.
339;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-04-26T19:01:05Z;Microsoft to buy e-games advertiser;;Microsoft is set to steal a lead on Sony in an important corner of the fast-evolving interactive games industry with the expected acquisition of Massive Inc, a company that places advertisements in online video games.The New York-based start-up is the biggest of several new companies that are trying to build networks to link advertisers with the hard-to-reach young males who are spending an increasing amount of their time playing video games.Placing ads over the internet into games while they are being played is already a proven concept, though it remains a rudimentary business, said Mike Goodman, a media and entertainment analyst at Yankee Group. “Money is flowing into this network, but it is not on the primary spend list” of the big advertisers, he said.Despite that, the risk of losing touch with an important part of their audience has prompted other early moves by traditional media companies to find a way into video game advertising.They include Viacom’s move earlier this week to buy Xfire, a company that operates a messaging service that connects games players.The decision to buy Massive at such an early stage reflects an attempt by Microsoft to take a lead before the games industry’s other big players act, with Sony and Electronic Arts the most likely rivals to try to build or acquire in-house advertising networks, Mr Goodman added.The first signs of a race among the games giants to build online ad networks echoes the more established search advertising systems already created by Google and Yahoo, with Microsoft struggling to catch up.Like those networks, observers expect only a small number of companies eventually to dominate the business.While the deal, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, has been agreed in principle, final details are still being worked out, said one person familiar with the process. Both Microsoft and Massive declined to comment.Although Microsoft’s base of 13m-14m Xbox users is still smaller than the 100m-strong PlayStation audience, it has succeeded in signing up a higher proportion of its players to its online service, creating a fast-growing base of users.More than 3m Xbox owners are believed to use the Xbox Live service, compared with about 5m online players on PlayStation.Sony is expected to move towards a more centralised online games service when it launches PlayStation3 this year.
340;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-03-28T15:30:48Z;Alan Cane: Why the price must be right;;Software pricing is a recondite subject, best left undisturbed. Unless, that is, you are a data processing manager balancing your IT budget or a software company boss trying to ensure adequate cash flow to see the next product through to market.Or, for that matter, a games enthusiast wondering whether $39.95, down from $49.95, represents good value for The Godfather, the latest potential blockbuster from Electronic Arts (the delayed arrival of Sony’s Playstation 3 console is playing havoc with finances in the games sector and forcing even the biggest games publisher to rethink its pricing policy).From a developer’s point of view, the dilemma is to balance a price acceptable to the customer with the need to generate sufficient profit to grow and invest adequately in research and development. It’s a complex equation. Increased, often cut-throat, competition together with the hugely increased cost of software development is forcing producers to look for new ways to boost revenues.Large software suites are typically licensed, not sold, with the aim of ensuring that the producer can count on a continuing revenue stream from product upgrades. Ram Dhaliwal, Microsoft’s UK licensing marketing manager, says the world’s largest software house prices its products according to what it judges the market will bear, while Sunny Jensen Charlebois, in charge of Worldwide Licensing and Pricing for the company, says its customers and partners want predictability: “One element of this is a predictable price for licensing Microsoft products. Therefore, changes to any regional pricing are done very rarely.”It was Microsoft, however, which five years ago proposed changes to its product licensing arrangements which the market would not bear, drawing unprecedented protests. Its customers argued they would be forced to pay for unwanted upgrades to their existing applications at times not of their choosing.The Infrastructure Forum, a lobby representing almost 100 large computer users, made representations to government. Microsoft, however, made sufficient concessions to mollify its indignant customers and the affair petered out.But as David Roberts, Infrastructure Forum chief executive, points out, it was the first time a software issue had reached the boardroom and brought home to board members the way that software pricing could affect their businesses.As one executive remarked: “It has changed the nature of our customer relations (with Microsoft) for ever.” And today there remains a simmering discontent, not only with Microsoft but with most of the large software providers.Price is not the only issue. A straw poll of Infrastructure Forum members shows four chief criticisms. They are concerned, first, that application upgrades often feature new “functionality” that users neither want, need or are prepared to pay for. While they accept the need for evolution, they argue that the software must meet their needs and requirements.The Forum members’ argument is backed up by a recent study carried out by the research consultancy Butler Group which found that more than 50 per cent of the functionality in enterprise software bought by large organisations was unused – although it puts much of the blame on IT management for failing to link functionality to business aims.Second, they are critical of producers who rush products to market without adequate testing. The result can be systems crashes and expensive and time-consuming repairs – “patching” in the trade’s argot.Third, they point out that shrink-wrapped, load-it-yourself software is unsuited to complex business environments. Companies need support from their suppliers to get the most from their software.Last, upgrade cycles: some suppliers refresh their software every three years, while big companies work on a five to seven year cycle. The result is that these customers do not see adequate return on their investment.Some software houses are adopting sophisticated methods to maximise their profitability. Organisation and Technology Research (OTR), the consultancy advising the European Commission in its action against Microsoft, has discovered that an automated licence-auditing tool (software designed to ensure a company buys only as many licences as it needs to) developed by a leading software house in the business planning area collects and delivers back to the developer more than 116 business variables when six would do.The inference, OTR suggests, is that the software house can calculate many of its customer’s key business metrics, giving it an invaluable guide to pricing its software for maximum profitability. OTR believes this may be true of other suppliers as well.So: caveat emptor. All this suggests the mismatch between what software companies offer and what their customers want – which has existed since the beginnings of business computing – is not improving. It may be that web-based software provision, where software becomes available as a service, a range of downloadable components across the internet rather than as a series of physical disks, forms the basis of a more equitable pricing mechanism.But the cost of research – and Microsoft, for example, is increasing its R&D spend by 12 per cent a year – will always have to be factored into the equation.
341;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-03-21T21:29:09Z;Rate fears weigh on Wall Street;;Shares on Wall Street lost ground on Tuesday amid renewed concerns over the prospect of further interest rate rises.Stocks came under pressure as investors mulled over a speech from Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, that seemed to quell hopes for a quick end to the current US rate-increasing cycle.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent lower at 1,297.23, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.9 per cent to 2,294.23, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.4 per cent to 11,235.47.Shares in GM continued their recent roller-coaster ride, up 5.5 per cent to $22.00 after falling more than 6 per cent over the last two sessions.Reports that the ailing vehicle maker was closing in on a deal with the United Auto Workers union and car parts supplier Delphi appeared to have triggered the latest rally.Analysts remained downbeat on the stock, with Citigroup reiterating its “sell” rating, saying that GM faced an estimated $4.7bn in idle hourly labour costs over the next two years.Dell Computer limited losses on the Nasdaq. Its shares rose 1.7 per cent to $30.27 after the world’s largest maker of personal computers said it expected sales growth to outpace the broader industry in 2006, thanks to rapid expansion in Asia.Shares in Oracle fell 0.7 per cent to $13.62 as the world’s third largest software maker reported disappointing third-quarter profits late on Monday.Apple Computer lost 3.4 per cent to $61.81 as France’s lower house of parliament passed a law that could challenge the company’s dominance of the online digital music market.Elsewhere in the technology sector, chipmaker Nvidia made progress, rising 4.9 per cent to $50.79 to reach a four-year high after an upgrade from Lehman Brothers.Video game maker Electronic Arts gained 2 per cent to $53.72 after Merrill Lynch upped its rating and price target on the stock. The broker said a “compelling” line-up of games should help boost EA’s earnings growth.News that Jones Apparel, owner of Nine West label and Barneys department stores, was considering putting itself up for sale drove its shares up 13 per cent to $34.84.The shares had been struggling in recent months as a result of weak demand in its wholesale footwear and accessories businesses.Elsewhere, rumours that Sir Richard Branson might be looking to buy out Bally Total Fitness sent shares in the health club chain up 14.7 per cent to $8.99.Healthways climbed 19.3 per cent to $47.14 after the healthcare company lifted its earnings guidance for the fiscal year 2006. Jefferies & Co raised its rating on the stock from “hold” to “buy”.Barr Pharmaceuticals rose 3.2 per cent to $65.59 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock, citing the growth potential of generic-drug sales.
342;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-03-19T18:43:02Z;EA has ‘lot to prove’ with Godfather game;;The much-anticipated video-game version of The Godfather movie and novel will go on sale on Tuesday after a long development process that has embroiled its publisher, Electronic Arts, in a bloody saga of its own.The Godfather was seen as a blockbuster franchise by EA when it acquired the rights and began developing the game – with the original star Marlon Brando completing voiceovers for his Don Corleone, Godfather character before his death.But while the world’s largest video-games publisher has spent a reported $10m to $20m to recreate the New York mafia world for games consoles and the PC, it has already taken a bigger financial hit from delays to the game.Its shares fell nearly 5 per cent last July, cutting more than $800m from the company’s value, after it warned of a delay that would make the product miss the big end-of-year holiday season.The setback contributed to revenue warnings that saw its shares slip further.In February, EA confirmed The Godfather would finally be released this month at the premium price of $49.95. But less than three weeks later, it changed its mind and announced a $39.95 price tag.Like the rest of the industry, EA has been suffering from pricing pressures as consumers resist paying high prices for more limited current-generation games, now that the next-generation Xbox 360 console has appeared.EA’s version of The Godfather for the 360 will not be ready until late this year.The game is the most complex yet attempted by the publisher – it is the first of its “open world” games where players can take a number of different directions in the mafia environment, rather than climb through levels. It has three different endings, including one that is close to that of the original movie.“It’s been very difficult to pull off and we’ve had one slip – from November to March – but we’ve managed to move it from being ordinary to extraordinary with the extra tuning that it needed,” David De Martini, executive producer of The Godfather, told the Financial Times.Peer Schneider, head of content publishing at IGN, the video-game information network, said games reviewers felt The Godfather had not been fleshed out enough and EA had been under pressure to improve the product.“EA has had a lot to prove – they have to make fans happy who like [car action game] Grand Theft Auto but also those who see it as more than an action movie. If you mess up on, say, Terminator 2, it’s not so bad, but when something is seen as one of the top-10 movies of all time, you don’t want to harm that franchise.”The Godfather is released in North America on Tuesday and in Europe on March 24.
343;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-02-07T08:41:38Z;RealNetworks expands into casual games market;;RealNetworks, the digital media company, on Tuesday announced plans to bolster its position in the online gaming market with the $21m acquisition of Netherlands-based rival Zylom.Privately-held Zylom will add around $8m in annual revenues, around 54 employees and a portfolio of 70 games to RealNetwork’s games business, helping the company position itself against rivals such as Electronic Arts, Microsoft and Yahoo in the casual games market.Casual games - simple arcade-style or puzzle games - are a small but rapidly growing part of the global games market.In contrast to console games, which typically feature shooting, racing or sports and take tens of hours to complete and appeal primarily to younger men, casual games are modelled on traditional card, board, puzzle and word games. They can be picked up easily, played in small time slots of a few minutes and appeal primarily to women over the age of 30, a demographic not otherwise reached by the games industry.Around 60 to 70 per cent of casual gamers are estimated to be women.Companies like RealNetworks make money from casual games by either selling games downloads and subscriptions to games sites, or from selling advertising space on games that are free for consumers to access on the internet.Michael Schutzler, vice president of RealNetworks global gaming operations, estimates that the casual gaming market is worth around $2bn to $3bn globally compared to the $25bn total games market.In the third quarter, the games business was the fastest-growing business division at RealNetworks, with revenues up more than 60 per cent at $14.7m.Casual gaming is also one of the more high-margin areas of the games market. Console games can typically cost $10m to develop and are highly dependent on becoming best-sellers in order to recoup investment. In contrast, casual games can be developed for around $100,000 and are less dependent on becoming hits.A number of games companies have been investing in this area. Electronic Arts runs an online games site called Club Pogo, Disney launched an online Game Cafe in November, and Microsoft launched an online games arcade 16 months ago, which can be accessed through the Xbox console.The acquisition of Zylom is the RealNetworks’ third deal to expand its online gaming presence. The company bought Mr Goodliving, a Helsinki-based casual games developer for $15m last May, and acquired GameHouse, a Seattle-based games company for $35.6m in 2004.Rutger Peters and Erik Goossens, who founded Zylom in 2001, will stay on to head the RealNetworks gaming operations in Europe.
344;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2006-01-31T19:20:16Z;Games groups gear up for a year of change;;Shortages of the latest console, a lawsuit over how games are promoted, fewer orders than expected for a blockbuster title – January was a tough month for video game publishers at the start of a tumultuous year of transition for the industry.Third-quarter results from Electronic Arts, the biggest publisher, tomorrow, and its forecasts for the rest of the year, could set the tone for the industry. EA has disappointed over the past few quarters but will hope for a return to form with its line-up for Microsoft’s Xbox 360 console and groundbreaking new franchises such as The Godfather, which was delayed but is scheduled for release next month.Publishers have been suffering as the new console from Microsoft has made consumers lose their appetite for buying games on the old Xbox. At the same time, component shortages and the slow roll-out of production of the 360 has meant demand has not been satisfied and publishers do not have the base they expected to achieve million-selling products.The French games publishers have also cited weakness in the market. Vivendi this week said sales faltered in its games division late last year while Ubisoft last week cut its annual sales forecasts as it reported softer European and US markets.Surprisingly, 2005 was a record-breaking year in the US with hardware, software and accessory sales worth $10.5bn beating the previous best of $10.3bn in 2002, according to the NPD Group, a marketing information provider.Sales of software for the Xbox, Sony’s PlayStation2 and the Nintendo GameCube were down 12 per cent on 2004, but the industry was saved by the strength of the growing portable gaming market represented by Nintendo’s Game Boy Advance and DS machines and Sony’s PSP. Software sales for these platforms grew 42 per cent.“Every time you have a console transition this happens – it throws everything into a change mode, and the portable sector really did help to smooth the transition in 2005,” says Anita Frazier, analyst at NPD.“This year the emphasis will be on getting a foothold in the next-generation consoles,” she says, with Sony’s PlayStation3 and Nintendo’s Revolution expected to join the 360 this year. Ms Frazier points to Activision’s success with Call of Duty, a highly realistic second world war shooting game: “It was the best-selling 360 game and even though the installed base was small, it did really well.”Others, such as THQ, which reports third-quarter results Friday, are saving their big next-generation releases for the summer, with Microsoft expecting to have shipped about 5m of the new consoles by the end of June. THQ has also been forced to push back the release of its Cars game, because the Pixar animation it is based upon has been delayed until the summer.A more unexpected delay in January was the postponement of the 10K results filing by Take-Two, best known for its Grand Theft Auto franchise. The Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation into the company last July after pornographic content was found hidden in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. The FTC is focusing on whether management knew of the content but did not disclose it in order for the game to avoid an adults-only rating.Take-Two said it needed more time to file its 10K to meet Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance requirements. Take-Two also suffered a major fire at its 2K Games subsidiary in January and, to complete its woes, the city of Los Angeles said it was suing over the hidden porn in GTA: San Andreas.Other publishers may also find themselves under scrutiny: the action against Take-Two was described as part of an ongoing investigation into the marketing of video games in general.
345;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-12-20T22:06:07Z;EA warns flagging sales to hit profits;;Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video game publisher, warned on Tuesday that flagging holiday sales would hit profits in the second half.“Holiday sales are not meeting expectations,” said Larry Probst, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “For the December quarter, it is likely the industry will be down double digits on a percentage basis.”EA said profits in the 2006 fiscal year would be “well below” its initial guidance. Most analysts had been expecting earnings of $1.41 a share in 2006, down from $1.71 a share last year.The profit warning was the latest in a string of bad news from video game publishers. Activision, a rival, last week warned that sales and profits for the quarter ending in December would miss estimates. The company blamed the trend on weak US and European sales.EA’s announcement on Tuesday echoed its warning earlier this month that sales of video games in the cruicial early-December shopping period were weaker than expected.Shares in EA rose 1.6 per cent to $53.11 ahead of the announcement, which came after the closing bell on Tuesday. The shares moved slightly higher in after-hours trading.
346;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-12-08T23:44:12Z;EA purchase expands move into mobiles;;Electronic Arts, the largest publisher of video games for consoles, on Thursday moved to extend its dominance to games made for mobile devices with the $680m acquisition of Jamdat Mobile.The announcement came as Electronic Arts warned that sales of video games in the important holiday shopping period of late November to early December had been softer than expected.Warren Jenson, EA’s chief financial officer, said the Jamdat deal would immediately boost EA’s presence in the mobile gaming market, which is seen as a driver of future growth.“Most in the world today can’t afford a $300 game console,” he said. “But many have a cell phone and can afford a game.”Jamdat has become the biggest name in the market of games for mobile phones, with titles such as Tetris, Bejeweled, Jamdat Bowling and Downtown Texas Hold ‘Em. Rumours that it might be bought by a leading publisher have circulated for months. News of the deal sent shares in Jamdat up more than 18 per cent to $27 in after-hours trading.EA has been focusing on converting many of its titles to mobile versions over the past two years as well as expanding into “casual” games along the lines of Tetris, which is responsible for a third of Jamdat’s revenues. Mobile gaming has been slow to take off in EA’s home territory, with only 18m players in the US compared to 170m worldwide, according to one industry estimate.Lawrence Probst, EA’s chairman and chief executive, said Thursday’s deal would help speed the company’s efforts to bring new mobile gaming titles to market.EA on Thursday said it planned to publish more than 50 games with Jamdat in the first 12 months following the completion of the acquisition, including its own popular sports titles such as FIFA soccer and Madden NFL.EA will pay $27 per share in cash for Jamdat, a 19 per cent premium over Thursday’s closing price, for a total of $680 million. The deal is expected to close in EA’s fourth quarter.

348;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-11-01T23:18:42Z;Electronic Arts reports sales slump;;Electronic Arts, the biggest video game company by market capitalisation, on Tuesday reported slumping sales and a sharp drop in profits in the second quarter.Net income fell 47 per cent to $51m, from $97m last year. Earnings were 16 cents a share - down sharply from the year-ago period. Revenues fell 6 per cent to $675m.The lacklustre results beat Wall Street’s even grimmer expectations, however, sending shares in the company up 1.9 per cent in after-hours trading. The shares had fallen 1.9 per cent to $55.79 ahead of the earnings report.EA has been battered this year by a variety of factors including falling sales as customers await the debut of a new generation of gaming consoles. In July, the company trimmed its full year earnings and revenue guidance after it delayed the release of a new adventure game based on The Godfather films.EA said on Tuesday that it expected earnings of between $1.40 and $1.55 a share for the full year, in line with earlier revisions. The company said it planned to release five new games for the Xbox 360, Microsoft’s new gaming platform, which is set to hit US shelves later this month.
349;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-09-05T17:35:51Z;Games and music: Industries in tune to woo young fans;;"This fall autumn video game players will be able to fight, shoot and bludgeon their way through life as Curtis Jackson, more popularly known as the rapper 50 Cent, while listening to more than 45 tracks of the artist’s music.The multi-platinum performer’s debut as the star of 50 Cent: Bulletproof represents the culmination of a gradual long simmering melding of music and video games, two genres industries that share the same demographic of young men with disposable income.In the early days of video games, sound was a luxury, with more internal resources being given over to making the game look pretty. Over time, the music grew more elaborate and eventually became noteworthy in its own right.There was a time when just releasing the game’s soundtrack on a separate CD was considered forward thinking. Nowadays, a full orchestra performs the music from Final Fantasy to sell-out crowds at venues across Americathe US; game companies such as Nintendo and Sony Computer Entertainment, maker of the PlayStation 2, sponsor summer music tours, with areas to play new and upcoming games , with names such as Nintendo Fusion; and Electronic Arts, the world’s largest independent games publisher, has a n entire division devoted to acquiring music for its titles . which is run by a former music industry executive.To maintain the interests of their fickle fans, game and music companies are teaming up in an effort to extend their brands. EA recently renewed its partnership with the record label Def Jam, a division of Universal Music, to continue making its its popular series of fighting games; MTV, owned by Viacom, launched a small group dedicated to games called MTV Games and is now working with Midway Games on the forthcoming street racing game LA Rush; the upcoming basketball title from 2K Sports – NBA 2K6 – will have the artists on heard in the game out on tour in the Fall Autumn to support the accompanying soundtrack under the name “2K Sports Bounce Tour”.For EA, the world’s largest independent publisher, continuing its partnership with Def Jam was a way to continue melding hip-hop and gaming. “Our expertise is making great games. Theirs’ is making great music. They help us bring in the hip-hop market and culture,” says Jeff Karp, group vice-president of marketing for EA.Using hip-hop to market games is a common tactic. The music’s gritty authenticity is a valuable commodity, despite its often violent connotations. 50 Cent’s music often focuses on his past as a crack dealer and being shot nine times. This has not stopped him from becoming a popular mainstream musician, with a biography and movie based loosely on his life due out at the same time as his video game. The game is being published by Vivendi Universal Games and 50 Cent’s label, G-Unit Records, is under the umbrella of Vivendi Universal.Vivendi Universal Games plans a marketing campaign that reflects his mainstream appeal. “He’s so mainstream, we see him on the cover of gaming publications as well as mass market publications and music publications,” says Cindy Cook, chief strategy and marketing officer, Vivendi Universal Games. “We have a broad media plan, focusing on lifestyle magazines and television that reaches the target audience.”2K Sports, makers of the upcomming NBA 2K6 basketball title, is also using hip-hop as a marketing hook. Besides the music of artists such as The Roots and RJD2 being heard in the game, a soundtrack will be released with an accompanying tour.“Ultimately games are a form of entertainment, so it only makes sense to integrate music,” says Tim Rosas, director of marketing and promotions and music supervisor for 2K Sports. “Hopefully through these music programmes, we can extend our reach outside of the core gaming community across many subcultures.”Hitting Appealing to a variety of many subcultures is one reason why Chicago-based Midway has partnered with MTV for a series of games, of which the first is LA Rush. In addition to featuring characters from the popular MTV show, Pimp My Ride, the channel will broadcast a special focusing on the game in October.“We’re all trying to leverage toour products,” says Steve Allison, chief marketing officer of Midway. “For us, we want to bring familiarity and appeal to people. Our strategy is to take away the risks of launching new intellectual property.”In addition to partnering with companies such as Midway, MTV, through its MTV Games division, through MTV Games, will seek to launch its own titles – all revolving around music. As befits a company with the word music in its name, the titles will all revolve around music. For now the company is keeping the specifics to itself, although it does not rule out something in the vein of Dance Dance Revolution, the popular rhythm-based dance game which see involves players following dance steps shown on screen.“It all starts with the user. Everything we do is focused on the audience. Folks who are huge consumers of MTV also play games,” says Jeff Yapp, executive vice-president of MTV Networks’ music and logo enterprise group.From the music industry’s perspective, record companies are recognising the benefits of placing a band’s music in a video game in the hope of exposing it to a wider audience – and eventually getting users to pay for the music no matter how it is delivered.“Our central strategy is to get music to where people are and, in that sense, video games are a key part of our strategy,” says Adam Klein, EMI Music’s executive vice-president of strategy and business development.Record labels are particularly eager to “match” their artists with popular games. The next installment in the series of games produced by Def Jam and EA will allow Def Jam, a division of Universal Music, even has two games, with a third due later this year, published by Electronic Arts devoted to allowing players to fight cartoon versions of many of its artists – such as Ludacris, Method Man and Ice-T. That much of the music heard in the game is also from Def Jam artists is a given.“We look at the portfolio of games coming out in the next year and map out which artists we are going to pair to which games,” says Greg Thompson, Island Def Jam’s executive vice-president of marketing. “When the opportunity is right, it’s a great association between artists and video games because we market to the same consumer.”Mr Klein holds out the possibility of updating the music featured in games. “If you play some of these titles, the soundtracks can become tedious,” he says. “How do you update that? This is becoming increasingly possible technologically and we are looking actively into doing that.”When it comes to revenues for the music industry, the numbers vary in terms of the licence fee paid to artists and their labels for use of their music in a game varies. Factors that go into the final figure include whether they are under the same corporate umbrella as the gamemaker, whether they are featured in the game’s advertising and whether they have a positive relationship with the record label.“It’s in the range of 1-2 per cent of the overall budget [of a game],” says Steve Schnur, worldwide executive of music and audio and a former music industry executive, at Electronic Arts. The budgets of high profile games typically range from $10m-$12m.Meanwhile, MTV Games is looking beyond hip-hop to other forms of music in search of the next big thing. “Clearly, if you look at development of gaming in general it is focused on urban music and on the coasts,” says Mr Yapp. “There is a huge audience in the middle of the country that watches Country Music Television [which is also under the Viacom umbrella] that needs to be served.”Drummed out: Yoda’s new star turnVideo game characters untethered from their own tenuous reality and forced to perform for our amusement? Just such a show recently began its second season on MTV2, sister channel to MTV, writes Kamau High. The show, called Video Mods, features animated characters from popular video games performing popular songs. You might, for example, see Yoda from a Star Wars games behind the drum kit or Obi-Wan wailing away on a guitar. Game developers hand over the building blocks of the game to MTV, which then has an outside company use the characters to create a music video set in the video game’s world.The games get another measure of publicity and the artists find a new life for their music. The videos, which can be seen at mtv2.com under shows, feature characters from games such as Death Jr, Half-Life 2 and Silent Hill. Typically the main character takes center stage, with the appropriate amount of pyrotechnics, and the supporting characters proceed to rock out with guitars, drums and bass. They look, for all and intents and purposes, just as good, and are often more interesting, than actual videos seen on the channel. ”We take a genre of gaming, and put a MTV twist to it. Video Mods takes music and sets it against look and feel of game,” says Jeff Yapp, executive vice president, MTV Networks, Music and Logo Enterprise Group."
350;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-09-05T17:35:49Z;Women: Finding a better fit for a wider market;;Something very different will appear on the shelves of Europe’s gaming retailers later this month.EyeToy: Kinetic, a physical exercise title, may appear out of place amid the piles of shoot’em ups, racing games and new season sports titles tempting PlayStation2 devotees, but this innovative product says a great deal about the industry’s attempts to conquer one of its final frontiers: the women’s market.Developed by Sony in partnership with Nike Motionworks, EyeToy: Kinetic is an interactive fitness title that will allow players to work through a variety of different exercise routines from yoga to combat.Alan Duncan, UK marketing director for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, says Kinetic illustrates how technological progress has allowed developers to move beyond the “holy trinity” of genres –- shooting, racing and sports – and produce titles that appeal to a much broader audience.He says the EyeToy, a camera and motion sensor that allows the player’s entire body to determine on-screen actions, has been central.“The traditional gaming interface has been a joystick of some sort and that involves a lot of practice. Over the years a gamer is used to it but if you’re not, it’s a barrier and it’s one of the biggest reasons that girls were not playing games,” he says.Perhaps because the young men who pioneered computer games forged an industry in their own image –- witness the male-oriented holy trinity – gaming has not been particularly welcoming to women until relatively recently.But change is afoot, driven in part by the recognition that failing to create an experience that appeals to 50 per cent of the population is not smart business.Gerhard Florin, managing director of European publishing at Electronic Arts, is another who believes that the richer gaming experience afforded by more powerful hardware and flexible software is laying the groundwork.“Today’s technology allows more real graphics to display better emotions. Hence we have games like the Sims (published by EA) for which in Europe 50 per cent of the consumers are females,” he says.That compares to a 5 to 15 per cent female audience for the average title.Developers, Mr Florin says, are also beginning to understand the different dynamics that appeal to their new audience.“We are now perhaps able to come up with games of today and tomorrow which play more and more on the communicative story side that girls react to. They want communication and co-operation rather than competition, which males want. I realise that’s a stereotype but it has its basis in truth,” he says.The result is a growth in games based on simulation and resource management.There is little doubt that the industry is changing to broaden its appeal but it is less obvious that it is getting its message through. and more More often than not, the mainstream media has remained fixated by the industry’s connotations with violence. when the industry’s story breaks into the mainstream media the tone is negative, fixated on violence or sexuality.Roger Bennett, director general of the European Leisure Software Publishers Association, says that a great deal of that coverage is unfair and discriminates against gaming when other industries carry similar content. Nonetheless, he admits gaming should do more to project its softer self and make people understand that it is a grown-up industry with a grown-up audience.“It’s our job to expand the information that is out there and tell people that it’s no longer a kids’ activity and entertainment, far from it. Because it has come from that sector there’s a misunderstanding,” he says.Mr Florin believes gaming has something of an in-built marketing disadvantage in that its stars are virtual and cannot perform the same level of promotional work as an actress or pop artist. And so EA has been looking at more creative ways of showing off its wares, such as a German campaign that employed a popular local musician and a tie-in with a fashion show in Italy.Similarly, Mr Duncan says that Sony is very keen to project an all-embracing image and will use an “80-year-old granny from Bracknell [a town in south-eastern England] as the pin-up for EyeToy.” The message is clear: anyone can play.While the profile of the average console player is gradually changing, publishers are finding that new market channels are proving more popular and accessible to women.The ubiquity of the mobile phone means that the vast majority of women own a device with games embedded, offering an entry-level experience. Meanwhile, the surge in broadband penetration means the internet now offers a much more rewarding platform which women appear to be drawn to.EA reports that in the US, more than 70 per cent of the 1m subscribers to its Pogo gaming channel are women.“These are parlour games, things like bingo and other relatively easy games,” says Mr Florin. “The average age is 34 and more importantly – and a huge surprise to us – is that the average gaming time per day is 78 minutes. That in our definition is a hardcore gamer.”
351;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-09-02T22:44:33Z;Electronic Arts shakes up management;;Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video-game publisher, announced a management shake-up on Friday after a year of missed targets and cancelled bonuses.EA said Don Mattrick, president of Worldwide Studios, was being replaced with immediate effect by Paul Lee, its Studio chief operating officer.Mr Mattrick, 41, is a veteran by games industry standards. He joined in 1991 when EA acquired his previous company, Distinctive Software. The company said he had “chosen to seek other opportunities outside of EA”, but did not disclose what these were.Larry Probst, EA chief executive, said David Gardner, a 23-year veteran at EA, would take over Paul Lee’s role while Frank Gibeau, formerly head of North American marketing, would now be responsible for the North American publishing division. Gerhard Florin, head of European publishing, would expand his role to cover Asia.“These promotions of Paul, Gerhard, David and Frank reflect the enormous amount of talent and depth within our organisation,” Mr Probst said. “I believe this is the strongest and most capable executive team in our industry.”EA has experienced a less than stellar 2005 compared to some of its counterparts. Lacking hits on the scale of Halo 2, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and World of Warcraft, it issued a full-year sales and profit warning in March. Profits in the fourth quarter to March 31 fell to $8m from $90m a year earlier.In July, it delayed the release until 2006 of The Godfather, one of its main hopes for the year, saying it needed more time to develop it. It also lowered its revenue forecast for the current fiscal year to $3.3bn-$3.4bn, down from $3.5bn.The management changes come as the industry is gearing up for a new-generation of games consoles – Microsoft is expected to release its Xbox 360 in November followed by Sony and Nintendo machines.
352;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Godfather game delay leads to EA warning;;A delay in the launch of a video game based on The Godfather movies prompted Electronic Arts to cut its revenues and earnings forecasts on Tuesday, adding to recent pressure on the biggest video game company.The delay, which the company announced earlier this month, comes at a time when EA's outlook is already clouded by the transition to a new generation of games consoles, led by the Xbox 360 later this year, as well as rising costs for the rights to some of its biggest-selling sports titles.The dollar's rise against the euro and sterling - a factor that has also started to weigh on the outlook of other US technology companies after a period when reported earnings were aided a falling US currency - had contributed to the lowered estimates for this year, the company said.Meanwhile, EA's latest quarterly revenues dropped 16 per cent from a year before and it fell into a loss as its latest stable of games titles failed to live up to those of last year, which had featured a new Harry Potter title.EA's shares, which had fallen nearly 5 per cent during the day, dropped another 3 per cent in after-market trading.The risk of hardware delays and other issues that arise during a transition to new games consoles meant that EA was likely to experience unexepected problems at some stage in the comping months, said Warren Jensen, chief financial officer. “There simply is too much change going on for us to expect otherwise,” he said, though he added that EA believed it would be able to handle the transition better than other video game companies.EA cut its revenue forecast for the current fiscal year, which ends in March, by around 3 per cent, to $3.3-3.4bn. The mid-point of its projected earnings range was cut by 6 per cent, to $1.45-1.60 a share.
353;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-06-27T15:21:29Z;Game on as industry eyes mobile market;;The mobile phone is the new promised land for the games industry. If gaming can make a successful transition from the console in the living room to the smaller screen of the mobile phone, it will represent an unprecedented opportunity to widen the demographics of the market.The mobile is a truly ubiquitous device. Some 674m were sold last year - compared with about 20m games consoles. It is expected that by the end of 2005 there will be more than 2bn mobile phone users worldwide.Better still, whereas the typical games console owner tends to be a 19- to 34-year-old man, mobile phones could be a way for games companies to reach older consumers and women - who make up less than 40 per cent of the gaming population.“This is the first time the gaming industry has had a device that isn’t solely for gaming but has an installed base of hundreds of millions of people,” says John Burns, director of European mobile sales and marketing at Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video games publisher. “You have the opportunity to take someone who doesn’t play games and interest them in the experience.”The ability of convergence to open up new demographic markets for products and services is not confined to the video games industry. The arrival of music downloading sites such as iTunes has widened the audience for back catalogues.Similarly, video-on-demand services have the potential to open up a new market for classic films not normally stocked by video rental outlets.The video game example also provides an insight into the dynamic convergence has sometimes created between larger companies and smaller start-ups that see a momentary opportunity to enter markets they might not otherwise have been able to.Reaching new demographics through the mobile phone will mean some big changes at games companies. Not all games translate well on to the phone format. Some, such as EA’s Fifa Football and Tiger Woods games and Ubisoft’s Tom Clancy Splinter Cell titles have done well, but many others have failed.Film-based titles, which generally sell well in the console world, for example, have not done well on mobile phones. Of the 47 games that charted over the past year, only two film-based titles - I-play’s The Fast And The Furious and Jamdat’s Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King - made it into the chart, both for one month only.In fact, the games currently topping the UK charts are the old arcade game favourites such as Tetris, Pac-Man and Space Invaders. Mobile phones have meant a new and lucrative lease of life for these brands. Jamdat, the US mobile games company, paid $137m in April when it bought Blue Lava Wireless, securing a 15 year exclusive licence to the wireless telephony rights licence for Tetris.Other classic games such as pub pool, monopoly and card games, known in the industry as “casual” games, that are familiar from other contexts also do well on mobiles.According to Michel Guillemot, founder and chief executive of GameLoft, the French mobile games company, the market is divided almost equally between action, sports and casual games. This is in contrast to the console games sector where action shoot-em-ups tend to dominate.The trend could tilt even further in favour of casual games in the future. At the moment, only 35 to 40 per cent of the mobile phones in the market have the Java technology that makes them suitable for playing more complex games. A majority of these handsets are still owned by early adopters, by and large that same group of 19- to 34-year-old men who are likely to be gamers anyway.“Now mobile games are having to adapt to more of a mass market, and we are likely to see more casual games,” says Pamela Clarke-Dickson, co-author of Mobile Games, a report from Informa Telecoms and Media.The development process for mobile games is also different. Mobile phone games are not just smaller versions of existing console titles. They are generally recreated completely from scratch to suit the particular features of a phone. In many cases, there is considerably more tailoring involved than for traditional console games.“The phone video game business is very different,” says Mr Guillemot. “Instead of proposing some games and then having consumers go out and buy the console to play them on it is the complete opposite. People already have a phone in their pocket. We have to adapt to the existing audience.”Adapting to the audience means making sure the games will work with every handset model on the market. Gameloft currently targets 250 different models and translates each game into five to eight languages. This means that there can sometimes be more than 700 versions of the same game and Gameloft has to employ about 1,000 people to ensure it can create them.Getting a game to its audience is also different. Rather than dealing with high street retailers, mobile phone games are mainly distributed through mobile phone operators such as Vodafone. There is only a relatively small space on operators’ portals to promote games and getting a prominent slot is vital.Perhaps because of these challenges, small independent companies rather than the big publishers have so far dominated the mobile gaming market. Like many convergence markets, mobile gaming has created an entry point for new companies.Gameloft has a relationship with Ubisoft - the French games publisher, but operates as a separate company. THQ Wireless is a subsidiary of THQ. But most other key players - such as I-Play, Jamdat, In-Fusio, Informa - are small independents. Jamdat and Gameloft are among the few that are stock market listed.However, as with other instances of convergence, once the market begins to mature the heavyweights inevitably move in.It is at this point that convergence moves into a higher gear - big games companies can ramp up volumes, pull in bigger deals and potentially get the message across to an even wider range of people.This is why this industry is now watching EA with interest. The company has become the first of the major publishers to start doing a substantial amount of mobile gaming in-house.“Everyone was waiting to see what EA would do,” says Ms Clarke-Dixon. “Now that they are making the move into the market it looks like this will be the year when more traditional video games publishers start to take the mobile games market more seriously.”
354;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-06-15T07:24:44Z;Glenn Entis of Electronic Arts;;Brave new worlds coming to a screen near you soonWhile the gaming public were wowed last month by the awesome capabilities of next-generation console hardware unveiled by Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony, game developers had been working in secret for months testing the limits of the new platforms.Glenn Entis, Chief Visual Officer for Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest games publisher, has enjoyed a closer look than most at the shape of gaming to come and the new possibilities being opened up.He spends much of his time visiting EA’s studios around the world, working with the different teams on pre-production and visual development of games for both the current and next-generation versions of the consoles.Microsoft declared at the E3 trade show in Los Angeles that its Xbox 360 console heralds the dawn of high-definition gaming and Mr Entis agrees: “High definition means richer, purer, brighter colours, stronger contrast ratios, everything we pay to see in a film we are getting now with high-definition consoles,” he says.“A director will talk about creating moods with light, but when you try to squeeze that through [regular] NTSC [TV format], a lot of that gets muddied out. With high-definition, it’s a much more compelling experience.”Widescreen - the 16:9 aspect ratio - also enables more immersive game-playing, he says, citing EA’s Need for Speed car racing title that will allow drivers to see a peripheral blur of objects going by as they race in Widescreen.Gaming also earns some unique added benefits from high-definition television: “It goes beyond what TV and films can achieve, because game cameras add another requirement to the display - you can see in front and to the left and right of the character you are playing.”Mr Entis is well qualified to comment on the differences between games, movies and television.He joined EA in 2000 when it acquired Dreamworks Interactive, the game development arm of the film company. He had been chief executive, working closely with Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg on more than a dozen games.From 1981 to 1995, he worked for Pacific Data Images, a company he co-founded with the ambitious idea at the time of using computers to generate graphics, initially for television opening and closing credits.PDI moved on to commercials and then movies, eventually creating the computer-generated animation films Shrek and Antz.But it had started out with a Digital Equipment Corp VAX-750 microcomputer, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars and having only a fraction of the processing power of today’s workstations. Processor-intensive rendering of animation could take hours and even days to complete.“Now we have got amazing games platforms and tools and it all gets done in a thirtieth or a hundredth of a second.“When I left PDI, I left that world behind because I was captured by the idea of real-time graphics where you would have real interactive control. It felt like I spent the first half of my career in a waiting room, where someone would eventually come to you and say: ‘Sir, your frame is waiting for you.’”The EA executive says tools have never been better for game development, with Microsoft introducing its XNA software platform to aid development for the Xbox 360 and EA buying Criterion, the British company responsible for Renderware tools, a de facto industry standard.But processing power and good developer tools do not necessarily guarantee a great next-generation game. That depends on the developers’ ability to instil emotion into characters and create games that go beyond the standard shoot ‘em ups.“We have had a lot of game characters that have given very stiff performances, their eyes and their hands have not been moving properly, the nuances of responses have been missing, but the next-generation platforms will allow a new fidelity. Characters will draw you in whether they are intimidating you or inviting you in to solve the problem.”Another area he identifies as providing major improvements is the creation of rich, living worlds: “There will be worlds alive with sound - if you hear something, you can follow that sound, you will catch something in the corner of your eye.“There will be dynamics of motion - smoke that looks real rather than painted, you will be making decisions and the worlds and characters will respond dynamically to that.”Mr Entis says there has never been a better time to be a game developer:“I am very lucky, I look back at the early days of PDI and we were a small group of people and we felt like pioneers.“But the last year and a half, as we have started to switch gears to next generation, I have never had more fun working, thanks to the quality of the people and the quality of the visuals. I’ve been 28 years in this field and this is the best time to be here.”
355;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-05-04T20:21:41Z;Wall St higher as Kerkorian lifts GM stake;;Surging shares in General Motors put a spark into trading on Wall Street on Wednesday, after a company controlled by Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire financier, said it would buy a sizeable stake in the struggling carmaker.Insurers also posted strong gains, as MetLife and Aon weighed in with strong earnings reports.By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 per cent to 10,384.64. The S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent to 1,175.65, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.5 per cent to 1,962.23.Ken Tower, chief market analyst at CyberTrader, cautioned against reading too much into the day’s gains, however. Mr Tower said the ratio between put and call options on the US indices remained elevated, “suggesting a strong lingering scepticism for the market’s ability to rally”.Investors were digesting an Institute for Supply Management survey, which showed that business growth among financial, construction and other services firms moderated last month, in line with expectations.Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow financial, said the large number of positive surprises this earnings season was a sign that companies were countering the effects of high oil prices by increasing productivity and cutting costs.General Motors was the centre of attention on Wednesday after Tracinda, the investment vehicle of Mr Kerkorian, said it would buy as many as 28m shares in the struggling automaker at $31 a share. The move would double Mr Kerkorian’s holdings in the company to 8.8 per cent. GM shares leapt 18.1 per cent to $32.80 on the news. Shares in the biggest US carmaker fell sharply from a January high of $40.30 after it warned on profits this year. Ford, GM’s chief US rival, rose 7.3 per cent to $10.16 on the coat-tails of the GM news.Strong results from a pair of big insurers lifted shares across the sector. Aon, the world’s second-biggest insurance broker, shot up 15 per cent to $24.45 after it beat expectations with profits up 18 per cent. MetLife, a New York-based rival, jumped 12.1 per cent to $43.55 after its earnings beat estimates. American International Group, the biggest US insurer, rose 2 per cent to $54.37.Elsewhere on the earnings front, Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video game maker, fell 6.5 per cent to $49.45 after it reported sharply lower profits for the first quarter and forecast a second quarter loss.Time Warner, the media group, rose 3.6 per cent to $17.28 after profits beat estimates.Utilities companies and energy groups put in the worst performances of the day. Dominion Resources, owner of Virginia’s biggest utility company, fell 3.3 per cent to $72.70 after its first quarter profits fell. Devon Energy, the oil and gas explorer, slipped 0.4 per cent, its second successive day of declines.Microsoft, the world’s biggest software company, slipped 0.6 per cent to $25.21.
356;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-05-03T22:15:26Z;EA profits plunge as rivals take lead;;Profits for Electronic Arts, the world's biggest video games publisher, plunged to $8m in the fourth quarter, down from $90m a year earlier, as it failed to match the blockbuster hits of its rivals.EA, which issued a full-year sales and profit warning in March, saw sales hit by the success of Microsoft's Halo 2, Take-Two's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Vivendi Universal's World of Warcraft.It reported net revenues for the year to March 31 of $3.129bn, slightly ahead of the $3.1bn to $3.125bn it had predicted in its warning.But diluted earnings per share of $1.59 were below the reduced guidance of $1.62-$1.64. EA's original estimates had been for EPS of $1.82-$1.87.Fourth-quarter sales of $553m were down 8 per cent from $598m a year earlier. EA said this was due to lower revenues from sales of games for the Sony PlayStation 2. Diluted earnings per share were 2 cents versus 29 cents a year earlier.EA said the poor PS2 sales were partially offset by sales on the Microsoft Xbox platform and the new Sony PSP handheld, where its Need for Speed racing game had been a best-seller.The company said it expected sales in the current fiscal year of $3.4bn-$3.5bn up 9 to 12 per cent year-on-year. Diluted earnings per share were forecast to rise to between $1.55 and $1.70.EA expects to release 30-35 titles in the year, including Harry Potter, James Bond and The Godfather games. Warren Jenson, chief financial officer, said: “We believe this is the year that we will lay the foundation for the next five years of performance and advantage.”EA's strategy would be based on hit games, owning next-generation software, dominating the PSP platform, exploiting mobile phone games and expanding in China, he said.There was also a growing online opportunity: “We have just crossed an important online threshold …1m paying subscribers are now using our services,” he said.
357;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-05-02T16:12:52Z;Virtual versions rake in real money;;American football fans are used to receiving pearls of eloquent wisdom from their favourite players. Ray Lewis, the burly Baltimore Ravens linebacker, offers the following advice in footage displayed on a website: “Defence wins championships,” he utters angrily, tar smeared across his face. “It’s in the game.”However, the website carrying this counsel is not a typical sports site dedicated to Mr Lewis, the Baltimore Ravens or even to American football. Rather, it is the website for the suite of sports video games produced by Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video games publisher.Mr Lewis’s comments form part of his promotion of Madden NFL, the most popular sports-based video game title in the US, which is now guaranteed a monopoly on National Football League teams following a five-year exclusive agreement between EA and the NFL signed last December.That formed part of a sequence of licensing deals major sports bodies in the US have been signing to cash in on the virtual versions of their games, with cash-rich video games publishers such as EA paying out increasing amounts for the long-term virtual media rights to sports. These games accounted for four slots in the top 10 list of best selling games in 2004.As a result, the $19.6bn global video game market is providing a new stream of revenue for sports bodies. The reported $100m a year reportedly paid by EA for the NFL rights is unprecedented and in part represents the video games companies asserting their new-found big media status.As global pay-television markets have demonstrated, when it comes to lucrative sports rights the name of the game is exclusivity. “It’s growing to a level where the sports leagues have started to think about it differently,” says Frank Gibeau, EA’s senior vice president of US marketing. “They’ve started to think about it like network TV deals and are looking for fewer partners.”The US trends could provide useful lessons for European sports bodies. For example, the NFL’s decision to go with just one partner in EA was a knockout blow for the rest of the games industry. Whereas before there had been four or five competitors making NFL games, now only EA can feature NFL stadiums, players and statistics. However, the move also incurred the wrath of a portion of the NFL’s fanbase in denying them a choice - many had preferred Take-Two Interactive’s game ESPN NFL 2K5.Competition had also given fans the benefit of a price war. Take-Two cut the price of its game to just $19 to win market share from Madden at $49.It was this that triggered EA’s bid for exclusivity, according to Michael Pachter, games industry analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities. “That was when they decided to play hardball and sign an exclusive deal and the consequence is that the publisher has a monopoly and the consumer won’t get a price break.”The NFL obviously calculated it would earn more from a single EA deal than the aggregate of selling its rights to four or five different publishers. Mr Pachter guesses it was offered two or three times the royalties per unit sold over five years that it was previously receiving for a game that had 80 per cent of the market.“But what happens in Year Six? - it can’t make a switch easily [to another publisher] - no one else will have made a game in five years. So here is EA in 2010 with five years’ experience of the new platforms and the NFL is screwed. EA will say: ‘Here is what we are going to pay you’, so I think the NFL was really dumb on this one,” says Mr Pachter.Major League Baseball may have had the same reservations when it decided to sign a semi-exclusive deal with Take-Two in January, offering long-term licensing rights for a rumoured $300m. The agreement still leaves the way open for the makers of games consoles - Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft - to produce baseball games.Take-Two has been criticised by its rivals for paying so much for a non-exclusive arrangement, but it insists it sees value in producing games that exploit baseball’s long season. America’s national pastime is watched half as much as the NFL, according to Forrester Research figures, and it lacks something in its translation to action sports games. This makes the franchise potentially less valuable.Chris Charron, Forrester analyst, says: “I think the NFL and NBA [National Basketball Association] have games that are very action oriented, with bursts of action and activity. Baseball is a lot different, it’s a longer game with lots of downtime.”The NBA was the last of the big three to sign the recent spate of licensing deals, which games publishers have been anxious to secure before the introduction of next-generation games consoles, with long lead-times needed for game development.It took the opposite tack to the NFL, signing and extending agreements with five different publishers - EA, Take-Two, Sony, Midway and Atari - worth a reported $400m in total over five or six years.“We did speak to current partners and third parties about what an exclusive arrangement might look like,” says Greg Lassen, the NBA’s senior director of electronic and interactive licensing. “But in terms of fostering creativity, getting more of a share of retail shelf space and the best exposure for the brand, this arrangement far outweighed what an exclusive offer might have brought.”Mr Lassen says a diversity of games - from backyard basketball to stars portrayed as kid players - had helped the NBA more than double its revenues from video games over the past five years.One area where the major sports bodies may compete head-on with video games publishers in the future is online fantasy leagues. These differ from skill-based action games and are more of a mental challenge to fans, who build teams and campaign them through a season.The NBA.com website has developed a fantasy league, while a deal between EA and sports TV channel ESPN could lead to fantasy leagues being included in the online elements of video games. “It’s an incredible opportunity that I think dwarfs video games, it’s become a huge business,” says Mr Pachter of the fantasy leagues, which charge users to register players and teams.The major sports could also have the advantage of owning game and player statistics. “It’s going to be up to the owners of that intellectual property how much room there is for the publishers,” he says.
358;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-04-25T23:00:47Z;Video games sales up more than 20%;;The value of US retail sales of video games rose more than 23 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter as the introduction of new portable consoles began to make an impact.The NPD Group, which researches industry sales, said these were worth more than $2.2bn, while actual unit sales grew 18 per cent compared with the first quarter of 2004, to nearly 63m units.Sony will announce on Tuesday the launch of its PSP portable console in Europe at the start of the third quarter. It had originally intended to introduce it before the end of the first quarter.The company instead focused its efforts on producing enough machines to meet US demand, where the PSP was launched last month, too late to have a major effect on first-quarter software sales.Nintendo had introduced its DS, a dual-screen handheld console, joining its Game Boy portables and Nokia's N-Gage, a combined telephone and console.Dollar sales of portable game software grew 69 per cent while hardware sales exceeded $293m, with dollar and unit growth of 162 per cent and 72 per cent respectively.In contrast, console hardware and software sales, including Sony's PlayStation2, Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo's Gamecube, showed the lowest percentage increases of 8 per cent and 7 per cent.Slowing console sales have been blamed by Electronic Arts, the biggest games publisher, for recent poor results. Next-generation consoles are on the way, with Microsoft expected to be first to launch, with a new version of its Xbox in the fourth quarter.Anita Frazier, entertainment analyst at NPD, said: “While we expected to see impressive sales in the portable categories, the fact that all categories saw positive sales in terms of both dollars and units is a real testament to the broadening appeal of video games as a form of entertainment.”
359;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Bono set to lose out in bid for Eidos;;It looked to be game over in the bidding battle for Eidos on Thursday when the UK games publisher's board of directors agreed to recommend the ?97.7m ($183m) all-share offer from SCi Entertainment, dropping their support for a rival bid from Elevation Partners.The Eidos board said that, although the SCi acquisition had certain risks, recent increases in the SCi share price meant the offer was at a significant premium to the Elevation bid.Shares in SCi, which is offering one new share for six Eidos shares, closed at 413p, giving the offer an implied value of 68.8p a share, compared with 50p a share in cash from Elevation.Management's hand was also partly forced by the fact that the SCi bid had gained the support of nearly 47 per cent of the Eidos shareholders, including Schroders, Merrill Lynch and Gartmore.?Having considered the market momentum behind the SCi offer, the board felt it was in shareholders' interest to move the recommendation,? said Mike McGarvey, chief executive of Eidos.People close to the negotiations said that Elevation was unlikely to come back with a higher offer, given that SCi had already won such extensive shareholder support. Elevation, a US venture capital group whose directors include U2 singer Bono and former Electronic Arts president John Riccitielo, made the ?71m offer for Eidos last month and initially received a recommendation from the Eidos board.However, the bid was trumped only hours later by a higher offer from SCi.Elevation's disappointment may be alleviated somewhat by the ?710,000 break-fee it will receive from Eidos if the SCi offer is declared unconditional.Eidos, which publishes games such as Hitman and the Lara Croft Tomb Raider series, began looking for a buyer more than eight months ago, after its cash reserves dwindled following a period of disappointing trading.SCi, which publishes titles such as the Conflict series and Carmageddon, is planning to raise ?60.1m through a share placing.
360;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

362;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Sony takes on Game Boy;;Sony launches its PSP handheld gaming console in the US on Thursday to the relief of games publishers in need of a revenue boost from the new platform.The sleek black pocket-sized Portable PlayStation being compared to Apple's iPod for its design appeal is filling a gap for publishers as the PlayStation, Xbox and GameCube consoles face replacement from the end of this year by next-generation home devices.The PSP is taking on Nintendo, whose Game Boy has outsold all consoles and whose DS model, a dual-screen device, has beaten Sony to market by several months.Publishers have been relishing the prospect of transferring or ?porting? their best-selling titles to the PSP, where they expect an older, more sophisticated audience than Nintendo's will appreciate the ability to play their games on the move on a widescreen device.But delays and limited availability are frustrating the industry and gamers. A European launch scheduled for the end of March has been delayed for several months and supplies have been limited in Japan to ensure demand can be met in the US.?The launch of the PSP has not gone as anticipated,? said Larry Probst, chief executive of Electronic Arts, the world's biggest video games publisher. ?It's been sort of start-stop-start in North America first Sony said they were shipping 1m units, then it got adjusted down, now it's back to 1m.?Analysts say Sony needs to get as many as 5m units into North America by the end of the year for a large enough base to be established. This would allow publishers to earn significant revenues from selling games for the new platform.Sony needs a big success after Apple's foray into the personal stereo market with the iPod digital music player took on its Walkman range. Retailers believe the PSP device will sell out a number opened at midnight to sell the first units.While reviewers have praised the $250 PSP for its gaming capabilities, its other functions have been seen as of questionable value.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 10,470.43. The S&P 500 fell 1 per cent to 1,171.87, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9 per cent to 1,985.50.Market-watchers had long expected the Fed to raise interest rates by a quarter point to 2.75 per cent. But stocks turned lower minutes after the Fed announced the change, as investors interpreted the wording of the announcement to mean that a more agressive programme of interest rate rises could be on the way.Jack Caffrey, equity analyst at JPMorgan Private Bank, said the Fed’s programme of slow and steady quarter-point rate rises was beginning to take effect.“People are being forced to make economic decisions, rather than just dig into savings,” he said.Traders were also digesting new data on producer prices showing that headline prices rose 0.4 per cent in February – slightly ahead of forecasts. Meanwhile, the price of oil retreated from near-record highs.Mergers and acquisitions continued to grab attention after Retek, the US software group, agreed to a $643m takeover by Oracle, the business software company.Retek shares slipped 2.3 per cent to $11.20 as investors gave up on the prospect of a counterbid from SAP, Oracle’s European arch-rival. Oracle shares fell 1 per cent to $12.53.Elsewhere, Electronic Arts, the video game company, fell 16.4 per cent to $55.45 after a profit warning.General Mills, maker of Cheerios cereal, fell 3.5 per cent to $49.73 after its quarterly earnings fell.Shares in Lennar, the housebuilder, rose 1.6 per cent to $55.77 after it reported higher quarterly profits.Wyeth, the drugs group, rose 3.7 per cent to $40.36 after it raised its quarterly guidance.Transport stocks led gainers on the S&P 500 after Union Pacific, the railroad group, raised its earnings forecasts. The company said it expected to earn 43-48 cents a share in the first quarter, up substantially from its previous estimate of 25-35 cents a share. UP shares rose 4.7 per cent to $69.18.UP shares, which fell in January after a bout of profit-taking, rose 3.5 per cent to $68.40 by midday – a new high for the year.Alcoa fell 1.4 per cent to $31.02 after the aluminium producer announced the sale of a Norwegian subsidiary. Alcoa also said it would cut 2000 jobs in an effort to cut down on costs.Insurers were among the day’s biggest losers. AIG, the biggest US insurer, fell 2.8 per cent to $56.30 as the departure of its chief executive last week amid a government probe continued to reverberate through the market.Consumer products groups fell after the Federal Trade Commission requested information about Procter & Gamble’s planned $57bn merger with Gillette. P&G shares fell 1.2 per cent to $52.13. Gillette fell 1.3 per cent to $49.66. Colgate-
Palmolive, P&G’s chief rival, fell 1.9 per cent to $50.68.Among retailers,Wal-Mart fell 0.4 per cent to $50.98. KMart slipped 1.2 per cent to $127.25."
364;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-03-22T19:27:13Z;NBA signs non-exclusive deals;;The National Basketball Association on Tuesday became the last major sporting body in the US to cash in on video games publishers' passion for sports franchises, agreeing a deal worth a reported $400m over five or six years.Unlike deals made by the National Football League and Major League Baseball, the NBA eschewed exclusivity to sign licensing agreements with five publishers: Electronic Arts, Take-Two, Sony Computer Entertainment America, Midway Games and Atari.The major US sports have been enjoying a significant increase in licensing revenues as cash-rich games publishers have exerted themselves as media players who can rank with television in the competition for rights.Electronic Arts, the world's biggest publisher, is believed to be paying about $100m a year for the exclusive rights to the NFL over five years and Take-Two is understood to have paid $300m for a long-term agreement with baseball. The NBA had also been under pressure to sign an exclusive deal, but would have noted the unpopularity of the NFL's decision with fans, who have been effectively denied a choice in an NFL video game.?This is a great day for NBA gamers,? said Adam Silver, NBA Entertainment president. ?By partnering with the top developers of sports video games, our fans will be assured a broad and competitive selection of innovative products.?The deal was further negative news for Electronic Arts, which would have been favourite to secure any exclusive deal.After New York markets closed on Monday, it shocked the industry with a warning of lower than expected sales for its year ending March 31. It said it now expected revenues between $3.1bn and $3.125bn compared to previous estimates between $3.275bn and $3.325bn.Diluted earnings per share were now expected to be $1.62-$1.64, compared with $1.82-$1.87 previously. EA shares fell more than 13 per cent on Tuesday to $57.32 on the Nasdaq in response.
365;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;U2's Bono and partners agree to buy Eidos;;"Elevation Partners, the US private equity group that includes Bono, the lead singer of rock band U2, on Monday night agreed to buy Eidos, the UK's largest computer games developer and publisher, for about ?71m ($135m).Elevation is paying 50p per share, the equivalent of a 27 per cent premium to Eidos's share price of 39p on Friday night. Bono is one of six partners who run Elevation. Others include John Riccitiello, the former president of Electronic Arts; Fred Anderson, the former chief financial officer of Apple Computers; and Roger McNamee, the co-founder of Silver Lake Partners.Elevation has $1bn of committed capital and was formed last year to invest in media, entertainment and consumer companies.Eidos is attractive mainly because of its Lara Croft game, which has spawned a Hollywood blockbuster featuring Angelina Jolie in the lead role. Eidos also produces Hitman and Championship Manager.Headed by Mike McGarvey, Eidos launched a strategic review last June as a result of poor performance, and since then has received a number of approaches.Takeover speculation was reignited early this month when Eidos said it had received a preliminary bid approach, but that this had to be formalised within two weeks if it was to avoid falling foul of its banking agreements.The same day, Eidos revealed it had fallen deeply into the red for the first half, reporting a ?28.7m loss, compared with a ?7.8m profit last time. It also warned that full-year performance would suffer from delays to the release of a number of games.News of the deal with Elevation could prompt other potential buyers, such as France's Ubisoft, to take one last look at Eidos. Elevation's move to take over Eidos comes as analysts are anticipating a flurry of deal-making in the video games industry, which is expected to grow dramatically in the coming years.However, many believe the biggest media groups, rather than private equity firms like Elevation, will be driving the consolidation.?It [video games] is a great business,? said Sumner Redstone, chairman and chief executive of Viacom, at a conference in January. ?No major media company can afford to ignore it.?Already enormous, the video games market is expected to grow sharply in the next two to three years. PwC estimates that the global video game market will expand from $22.3bn in 2003 to $55.6bn in 2008.The introduction of the next generation of console games in 2006-2007 will drive this growth, PwC said in a report. Online and wireless games are also expected to develop strongly."
366;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-03-04T12:03:01Z;The week in technology: Bill Gates knighted;;Bill Gates has had a very busy week. On Wednesday the founder of Microsoft received a coveted honorary British knighthood for his aid work in Africa - he recently donated $750m to vaccinate children in poor countries and the foundation he has spearheaded with his wife has given away more than $4bn over the last 10 years.Back in the office, Microsoft was knocked out of the hotly contested arena of sports computer games, as rival software group, Ubisoft, said it was buying the technology, tools and source code used in Microsoft Game Studios’ team sports games.The US software giant has been gradually back-pedalling from sports games. The handover to Ubisoft - for an undisclosed sum - clears the path for a heated contest between the three traditional forces of games publishers, Electronic Arts, Take-Two and Ubisoft.Later in the week Microsoft saw a landmark $521m patent-infringement judgment against it overturned by a US appeals court and sent back to be reconsidered by a lower court. The decision came a day after another patent claim, brought by chipmaker Rambus against Infineon Technologies, was also thrown out.Microsoft is accused of abusing a patent relating to a key piece of internet browser technology, which controls the way browsers can be used to launch software “plug-ins”.The case was brought by the University of California and Eolas Technologies, a company set up by the former head of the university’s academic computing centre, Michael Doyle.But the initial infringement ruling was dismissed due to the possible existence of “prior art” that would invalidate Doyle’s patent.Qwest back in the runningRegional US telecom Qwest still has a foot in the door in its bid to buy MCI, after the long-distance carrier reluctantly re-opened negotiations despite already accepting a $6.75bn bid from Verizon.It is the latest twist of a complex love triangle that began several months ago when Qwest opened talks - only to have its $8bn offer rejected, impeding the smallest baby bell’s efforts to bulk up in the latest wave of consolidation spreading across the US telecoms sector.Two weeks ago, MCI accepted Verizon’s cash and shares offer, appearing to snuff out any chance of a revived Qwest bid.But owing to pressure from Qwest and some of its own shareholders, MCI said it had held meetings to review the Qwest offer.While Qwest welcomed the news it remained sceptical about whether MCI was serious about holding meaningful talks, while Verizon, who said it would allow two weeks for further negotiations between Qwest and MCI, remained confident it would win in the end.Meanwhile, the final evidence was heard in the trial of Bernie Ebbers, the former chief executive of MCI’s previous incarnation WorldCom.Mr Ebbers fate is now in the hands of 12 jurors who have sat through a six week courtroom battle to decide whether he participated in the huge accounting fraud which brought WorldCom to its knees in the biggest ever corporate bankruptcy.In an unusual move, Mr Ebbers took the stand in his own defence, claiming ignorance of the false expense adjustments and the booking of questionable income.Scott Sullivan, Mr Ebbers’ right-hand man at WorldCom and the main witness for the prosecution who has pleaded guilty to similar charges, claims he was pushed to commit fraud by his former boss.Mr Ebbers may have trouble convincing a jury that a CEO could have no knowledge of such a massive fraud going on inside his company - but he may benefit from a lack of documentary evidence against him as he rarely used email.The verdict will be closely watched in these post-Sarbanes-Oxley days to see where exactly a chief executive’s responsibilities lie.Motorola bounces backMotorola made a comeback this week as the handset maker regained its position world’s second-largest mobile phone maker in the fourth quarter last year, pushing rival Samsung of South Korea back into third place.Samsung had shifted up into to second spot for the first time in the third quarter, but Motorola staged a swift turnround by selling 31.7m units, and taking a 16.3 per cent market share in the three months to the end of the year from 13.4 per cent in the quarter before.The numbers were released by Gartner, the technology research house, which attributed some of Motorola’s success to the halo-effect of its RAZR V3 handset that was well-received in Europe and North America as well as aggressive pricing in markets in Asia-Pacific and Latin America.The data from Gartner, considered one of the main yardsticks for the industry, also confirmed that Nokia, the world's largest handset maker, was continuing to stabilise its market share at the end of 2004 after a disastrous start to the year.Chips beat off seasonal bluesThe chip sector received a shot in the arm this week as the Semiconductor Industry Association reported a bullish 17.5 per cent increase in sales in its latest monthly figures despite January being a traditionally weak month.Worldwide microchip sales for the month hit $18.3bn, up from $15.6bn in January last year but were down 0.5 per cent from December, where sales were $18.4bn owing to traditionally strong holiday trading. Industry capital spending increased to $47bn about 22 per cent of sales.The latest figures suggest that threat of a downturn is lifting, according to the SIA, which added that the excess inventories that slowed growth in the second half of 2004 had now been largely depletedThe SIA also pinned hopes to recent signs of recovery in the US economy, which registered 3.8 per cent growth in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter.
367;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Quest for online treasure chest;;"China's internet games business trades mainly in fantasy, but its appeal to investors is very real: with an estimated 26m gamers online and a piracy-resistant business model, the sector offers the promise of treasure more substantial than any to be won by buff virtual heroes.The Chinese games industry's growing importance was underlined last month when Shanda, a leading Chinese online-gaming operator, bought a 19.5 per cent stake in Sina, the country's biggest internet portal, a move seen as prelude to a possible takeover.But international games companies were already keenly aware of the potential of the market, which the China Game Producers' Association says was worth about Rmb2.47bn ($298m) last year - and which it forecasts to grow to more than Rmb10bn by 2009. ""China is our number- one target market,"" says John Needham, chief financial officer of San Diego-based Sony Online Entertainment.Like Shanda, international games publishers such as Sony are focusing on massively multiplayer online role-playing games - or MMORPGs - rather than the standalone titles for PCs and games consoles. The reason is simple: subscription-based MMORPGs are much harder to pirate than standalone games.Electronic Arts, the world's biggest computer games publisher, for example, is proud that its standalone Fifa football simulation game has been a number-one seller in China. But David Gardner, head of international publishing at EA, ruefully notes that 99 per cent of the copies sold were pirate versions. ""Nine million copies were sold at a dollar each. Official sales were 100,000. Nothing was coming back to us,"" he says. ""The companies that are extracting any money are those doing online gaming.""While standalone games can easily be copied and sold, MMORPGs aim to build a lasting relationship with the player. The software needed for online games is offered for free or at low cost - revenues come from sales of pre-paid cards or monthly subscriptions.In return, players can join vast online worlds populated by hundreds of thousands of other users. And since MMORPGs are operated from centrally controlled computer servers, access can be relatively easily controlled - because our business is driven by subscription services. It is possible to set up rogue servers for online games, but it is difficult to pull off,"" says Mr Needham of Sony.Yet western and Japanese games companies already lag behind rivals from South Korea, where MMORPGs are hugely popular. These games offer an Oriental fantasy flavour that has gone down well with Chinese players.South Korean exports of online games soared to an estimated $250m last year from $151m in 2003, with most sales coming from China, Taiwan and south-east Asia.To catch up, other international companies are focusing on localising established products. EA has opened a development studio in Shanghai and moved Erick Hachenburg, one of its top executives, to China to run it. The company plans to employ 500 people in the studio by the end of the decade.But western publishers have also concluded that they can achieve little in China without local or regional partners.Sony is working through a joint venture with Gamania, the Taiwanese host and publisher of online games. It hopes to establish itself firmly in China with the launch of the latest version of its Everquest online world this summer.Everquest is Sony's flagship online game and with others - PlanetSide and Star Wars Galaxies - gives the company more than 750,000 subscribers worldwide. ""We are 'culturalising' our products for the Chinese,"" says Mr Needham. ""We learnt a lesson a few years ago that a simple translation doesn't work well. The characters still looked western and even the way they moved around was in a western way. Gamania has given us the knowledge about the way gamers want to play.""Such localisation is not easy: Everquest II was launched last November in the US but will take about six months to adapt for China, with more than 1.5m words to be translated and other content and characters to be changed.And even with localised games and local partners, success is far from assured. Shanda and other local games operators have already established a dominant presence among Chinese gamers and ties to the hundreds of thousands of internet cafés where most players go online. And the Chinese operators are working hard to establish their own products to avoid having to pay hefty licensing fees.Sony has had mixed success to date with its online strategy in China. Everquest I was withdrawn after Sony's partner Ubisoft said it would no longer support the product.Foreign games publishers will also have to contend with growing competition that is likely to trim margins for all but the most successful titles. Analysys International, a Beijing-based advisory group, warns that growth in the number of Chinese players of MMORPGs has already started to decline - and that only half of Chinese online gaming operators are likely to be profitable this year."
368;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-02-16T18:16:50Z;Bourses’ winning streak comes to an end;;Leading European equities finally took a step backwards on Wednesday after recording 32-month highs in each of the previous three sessions.TF1, the French television broadcaster, put in the day’s worst blue-chip performance after it gave a cautious growth forecast for 2005 and proposed a lower-than-expected dividend.The company said it expected advertising revenues to grow by between 3 and 4 per cent in 2005, after rising 6.6 per cent last year.“This new guidance is in line with our current expectation for 2005, but could slightly disappoint the market,” said Credit Suisse First Boston. “We note that January advertising in France has been particularly difficult, especially compared to a good start for 2004.”TF1 shares fell 3.7 per cent to €24.95.Statoil eased 0.2 per cent to NKr107.25 after the Norwegian government reduced its stake in the company to 71.7 per cent from the previous 76.3 per cent, via a placing executed by Merrill Lynch at around NK106.1 through a bookbuilding.The government took advantage of the recent strength of Statoil shares, which hit a record NKr107.25 last week. The company was listed on the Oslo market in 2001, with the government’s stake cut to 82 per cent. It was further cut to 76.3 per cent last July when a block of 100m shares was sold.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley raised its short-term oil price forecasts to $40 for 2005-6 and to $35 for 2007 and its long-term normalised price assumption to $32from $30.It also raised its price targets on oil stocks by an average of 5 per cent for the sector as a whole, with the largest increase, 12 per cent to NKr112, for Statoil which it said “benefits from both a light crude slate and high upstream gearing as well as a positive move in our forecasts for the dollar versus the krona”.Another big placing was carried out by SG, which sold a block of 90m shares, or 2.65 per cent, in Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, Spain’s second-biggest bank, with a further 16m shares, or 0.47 per cent, available.The stock was sold on behalf of Sacyr Vallehermoso, the Spanish construction group which had built up the stake over the previous 2½ months with a view to becoming the bank’s biggest shareholder. It scrapped the plan on Tuesday.BBVA shares, which ended the session 1.6 per cent lower at €13.14, were placed at around €13.10. Those of Sacyr, which made a profit of around €150m on the deal, jumped 5.4 per cent to €13.96.Commenting on the move, Deutsche Bank said: “We regard this as very good news for BBVA as it eliminates all the noise and uncertainties surrounding the bank during the last three months.”Nordic telecoms stocks provided some interest following the release of results from Tele2 and Telenor.Stockholm-listed Tele2’s fourth-quarter core earnings beat forecasts, and the company also said it had seen a healthy rise in new customers in the period.But it said it expected pressure on profits in coming quarters, and its shares fell 2.7 per cent to SKr255.50.Telenor, Norway’s leading telecoms group, fell 0.9 per cent to NKr57.50 after it said that tough competition in Denmark had led to a fall in core profits in the fourth quarter. However, it said it expected its mobile units outside the Nordic region to boost 2005 earnings.Metro, the German retailing group, rose 1.1 per cent to €41.44 after Merrill Lynch returned the stock to its “buy” list with a price target of €45.In a note to investors, Merrill said it believed the stock’s valuation was only average for the sector for this “above-average” business.Storebrand, Norway’s biggest insurance group, was the outstanding performer in the insurance arena, climbing 5.6 per cent to NKr61.75 after unveiling a 43 per cent leap in fourth-quarter profits and a bullish statement on current year prospects.French video games maker Ubisoft rose 3.9 per cent to €32.90 following reports that it was holding talks with US rival Electronic Arts. EA acquired a near-20 per cent stake in Ubisoft last December, sparking a sharp rise in the French company’s shares.Germany’s sports goods group Puma gained 2.3 per cent to €186.74 after CSFB hoisted its price target on the shares to €280.1 from €258.
369;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-02-06T17:35:37Z;EA's coup takes out the competition;;"The Philadelphia Eagles ran out the surprise winners of Superbowl XXXIX with safety Michael Lewis turning out to be their Most Valuable Player at least in the computer simulation of America's biggest sporting event.Lewis came out top in the Madden Bowl, the annual event staged by games publisher Electronic Arts at the Superbowl venue, where National Football League players compete against one another on a computer console.The Madden NFL game is popular among both players and fans and could become even more so after EA signed a five-year exclusive licensing agreement with the NFL in December that effectively eliminates any serious competition in the field from other publishers.The deal is estimated to be costing EA $100m a year and its main sports rival Take-Two delivered a similarly expensive riposte last week. It announced long-term licensing rights to Major League Baseball, completing an agreement with players and the league rumoured to have cost it $300m.The large sums are a sign that games publishers now see themselves in the big league of consumer entertainment and that sports bodies such as the NFL have found another arm of the media, after television, that is willing and able to pay millions to exploit their franchise.Mark Argento, a games industry analyst at Think-Equity Partners, says: ?Up until now, the games companies didn't have the balance sheets to write the big cheque, but that changed with this latest console cycle. They have more cash; it's become big business and big media now.?EA has more resources than any of its rivals. With a market capitalisation of about $20bn, it is more than 10 times the size of Take-Two and had cash on hand of $2.6bn at December 31.But it has been challenged of late, with its third-quarter sales down 3.2 per cent year-on-year as Take-Two's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas became the best-selling game of 2004 in the US, with Microsoft's Halo 2 in second place and Madden NFL pushed down into third.Madden's market share was also eroded by Take-Two selling its ESPN NFL 2K5 game at an average price of $19, compared with $49 for the EA game.It is this undercutting that is thought to have stung EA into action: not only sealing an exclusive deal with the NFL, but also agreeing a 15-year licensing deal last month with the sports broadcaster ESPN.?Take-Two has clearly begun to challenge us in sports, but we are very comfortable competing,? said Frank Gibeau, senior vice-president of North American Marketing at EA.?We are not satisfied with 68 per cent market share [for Madden], we want higher; we want [sports games] to be 25 to 30 per cent of our business, not 20 per cent [currently] and we want partners who will allow us to achieve that.?Mr Gibeau questions the value of Take-Two's deal with Major League Baseball when it allows console makers Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft also to make games using the franchise. But Take-Two spokesman Jim Ankner said it wanted to continue to allow consumer choice.?The NFL has essentially locked out Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo from making games on their own platforms. If there's no competition, the consumer suffers and how is that good for your business??Nearly 20,000 gamers have signed an online petition protesting about the NFL and its players' decision to award EA exclusivity in the use of the brand, images, stadia, schedules and rosters.They threaten a boycott of the NFL and sports gamers have turned off in the past to exclusive deals and a lack of choice unit sales of Nascar car racing games have declined from 1.5m to around 0.5m since EA squashed Atari in that market with an exclusive six-year deal with Nascar from 2003.Analysts are also concerned the rising cost of such deals will hamper financial performance. ThinkEquity Partners says Madden NFL, which had been a cash cow for EA, will now be significantly less profitable, although it may serve to drive sales of other EA sports games.?Madden is now more of a trophy to build around,? says Mark Argento.With football and baseball signing major licensing deals, all eyes are now on the National Basketball Association and how it handles the licensing of the second most popular sports game after gridiron."
370;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-01-31T18:47:19Z;Gunning for players;;"The latest quest for the video games industry is not a shoot-'em-up thriller - it is the search to find Germany's missing gamers. The country has been one of the most difficult in Europe for games companies to penetrate. With 38m households, it is potentially one of the largest markets in Europe.For example, some 24 per cent of UK households have a Sony PlayStation 2, the world's most widely sold games console, but just 6 per cent of households in Germany have a PlayStation. This is partly to do with the effect of reunification: statistics show that while between 12 per cent and 13 per cent households in the former West Germany have PlayStations, just 4 per cent of homes in the former East Germany have the consoles.For Gerhard Florin, head of European operations for Electronic Arts, the world's largest games publisher, this represents an enormous opportunity. ""If we could get German game-playing up to the level of the UK, Europe would become EA's largest market, even overtaking the US,"" he says.Germany is not a laggard in the technology department: internet usage, for example, is 57.1 per cent, according to statistics from Nielsen/PR. This is one of the highest levels in Europe, and very close to internet usage in the UK - 58.5 per cent.But industry observers believe that there are a number of socio-cultural factors that have slowed the adoption of video games in Germany. A relatively low birth rate is an important factor, says David Reeves, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, who has conducted studies of the German games market over the past two years. According to the United Nations, the average German woman has just 1.4 children, compared with 1.6 per woman in the UK.These differences seem minor, but when combined with stricter parents who are more likely to steer children away from video games and towards homework, German children are older than their British counterparts when they do finally take up the hobby. Sony's research shows that British children start to play games at around three or four, while German children are more likely to start between five and six. There is also a strong culture of reading in Germany, according to research by Mintel, which takes leisure time away from game-playing. ""Germans feel they are supposed to spend time on their education or career,"" says Mr Florin.A third factor is the difficulty that retailers face in entering the German market. The dominance of the Metro group - which also sells fridges, cookers and satellite dishes - is cited as a factor in explaining why it is difficult for many foreign games specialists to enter the market. For example, Game Group, the UK-based games retailer that has been building a presence in continental Europe since 1999, says it has no plans to enter the German market. As a result, most Germans tend to buy their games from general electrical retailers, such as Mediamarkt, part of the Metro group.Electronics Boutique, the US-based games group, is one of the few international specialist games retailers to have stores in the country.It entered the market three years ago through the acquisition of a small German rival, Gameit. Since then, it has worked closely with ECE, the German developer of shopping centres, to establish its presence. Today, the company has some 39 stores in Germany, but feels the market could support as many as 200 stores.Games companies are trying hard to change the image of gaming in Germany. Sony, which would like to see PlayStation penetration reach 20 per cent of German households by 2009, is promoting a more family-friendly image with games such as The Sims and with interactive accessories such as the Eyetoy. More generally, games companies are learning to tailor games to comply with German decency standards, which are considered some of the strictest in the world.In order to avoid risking a ban by the Federal Supervisory Body on Media Harmful to Young Persons, publishers often prepare an edited version for Germany. For example, games based on the second world war leave out Nazi swastikas; spurting blood is changed to green, suggesting an alien rather than a human has been killed.Video games companies are also holding out hope that the new generation of handheld games consoles - such as the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo's Double Screen, soon to be launched, will help change the market. Germany has traditionally been more receptive to portable games. Nintendo's Gameboy, for example, did well in Germany in the 1990s. ""Most German parents say they don't want their kids sitting in front of the TV screen playing games,"" says Mr Reeves of Sony. ""But they don't mind giving them a handheld console in the back of the car."""
371;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-01-26T07:38:37Z;Constructing e-mail links;;A building site can be an unpredictable environment, particularly for workers trying to maintain constant e-mail contact with colleagues and clients. “There’s a lot of machinery which causes radio interference and also other workers who will move or cut a cable to get on with their job. It’s very challenging at a site to keep the technology functioning,” explains Gregg Davis, senior vice president and CIO of Webcor, a leading Californian construction company.Wi-Fi technology (a wireless hotspot or Lan) might sound as if it should be the solution to supporting e-mail, but Mr Davis says it offers poor connectivity with so much concrete and steel around, as well as having poor security.However, the company’s project managers sometimes want rapid answers from architects as well as sub-contractors such as electricians and plumbers, while its project directors need to liaise with the owners of a building, he explains.“What we’re building are 50-storey buildings, but they are often prototypes. These are not cookie-cutter designs so you can find a situation where an air conditioning duct looks as though it’s supposed to go through a wall that can’t be penetrated. The manager has to put in an e-mail to the architect. We need an answer quickly. We can’t sit and twiddle our thumbs.”Webcor has built a range of large-scale projects in California including hotels, residential housing, shopping and office developments for clients including US tech companies Adobe, Electronic Arts, Oracle and Symantec.In the past, the company issued all 75 of its managers with a laptop, which they used to access their e-mail from a site office, along with PDAs and mobile phones. Then 15 months ago, Webcor opted for a smartphone customised with software for its individual needs, so that the managers could get at their e-mail securely while on site. The customised solution also enables them to access corporate applications. The company uses palmOne Treo 600 smartphones and the software is supplied by US vendor Good Technology.Early last year Webcor went a stage further by introducing a programme whereby managers could exchange their laptops, cellular phones and PDA for the combination of a Treo smartphone and a desktop PC. So far around one-third of them have swapped, with a saving in 2004 of $75,000 for the company because it no longer has to provide costly technical support for laptops.The screen of a smartphone is smaller than that of a laptop, making it unsuitable if employees need to study a technical drawing, but this limitation does have one advantage on a building site, according to Mr Davis: “With the mobile we can control more of what’s on the screen. It’s not good for workers to be looking at devices while in a hazardous area. We considered offering tablet PCs to the workers, but they blocked the view of their feet so they might walk into a trench or whack their heads.”
372;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-01-25T23:25:27Z;Electronic Arts hit by weaker holiday sales;;Electronic Arts, the world's biggest computer games publisher, on Tuesday reported sales and profits fell compared to a year earlier in its key holiday season quarter.EA said sales fell 3.2 per cent to $1.428bn (Q3 2003: $1.475bn) and net profits were down 4.4 per cent at $375m. Diluted earnings per share of $1.18 were at the top of its guidance and met market expectations.The best-selling games of 2004 were Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas from Take-Two, which sold more than 5.1m copies, and Microsoft's Halo 2 with more than 4.2m sold, according to the NPD research group. EA said its best-selling games in the period included Need for Speed Underground 2, FIFA 2005, The Lord of the Rings and Sims in the City. The Sims was its biggest franchise selling more than 16m copies in the calendar year. But EA released only 11 titles in the third quarter ending December 31 compared with 13 a year earlier.Chief financial officer, Warren Jenson, said: ?We think 2005 will be a defining year, with new platforms coming out such as the [handheld] Nintendo DS and [Sony] PSP and the possibility of next-generation consoles.?Sales in North America were down 8 per cent at $692m, but up 1 per cent at $666m in Europe and up 9 per cent to $70m in Asia.EA said it foresaw consolidation in the industry but did not hint at any immediate acquistions. It agreed to buy a 20 per cent stake in French publisher Ubisoft during the quarter, but Mr Jenson said EA was keeping its options open. ?We could seek a controlling interest, it's also possible that we would sell our shares.?
373;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-01-24T19:01:14Z;Fox signs mobile-phone games deal;;Twentieth Century Fox, the movie studio owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, has signed a two-year deal to develop video games for mobile phones to coincide with its film releases, starting with the forthcoming computer animated film, Robots.The deal with Sorrent, a US games company that specialises in mobile phone content, highlights the expanding market for games and other entertainment that can be downloaded on to increasingly sophisticated mobile phones. It is also one of a growing number of partnerships between content creators and video games companies.?Licensing deals are the most profitable way for media companies to use their content in the video games market,? said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities.Last week, shares in Electronic Arts, the biggest video games company, rose after it signed a 15-year exclusive agreement with ESPN, the sports channel majority owned by Walt Disney. ESPN currently has a deal with Take-Two Interactive, another games company, but the deal expires next year.Film studios such as Fox view such agreements as a way to extend their franchise into the mobile-phone entertainment market, which includes ringtones. It is already big in Asia and is expected to grow rapidly in the US and Europe.Mobile carriers are enthusiastic because mobile gaming is expected to help drive higher data revenues and offset their declining revenues from traditional voice calls.?Mobile entertainment is not only one of the fastest growing categories in mobile telecommunications, it is an exploding sector of the more than $20bn global video market,? said Sharon Wienbar, a director of BA Venture Partners which recently led a $20m financing round for Sorrent.According to a recent report by PwC, there were 3m wireless game subscribers in the US in 2003, representing just 2 per cent of total mobile-phone users.It projected that by 2008, 30 per cent of wireless telephone subscribers would also subscribe to a wireless games service.Based on a monthly fee of about $4 and a projected mobile subscriber base of about 197m by the end of 2008, PWC estimates that spending on wireless gaming in the US alone will jump from $142m in 2003 to $2.8bn in 2008. The mobile game for Robots will debut simultaneously with the release of the video console title, which will be published by Vivendi Universal Games.Fox and Sorrent also plan to work together on mobile phone content to coincide with the release of other films, including Kingdom of Heaven, Mr & Mrs Smith, and Ice Age 2: The Meltdown.
374;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-01-12T22:34:58Z;News Corp to target games;;News Corporation is seeking an acquisition in the video games market but is not sure whether it can find a suitable target, Peter Chernin, chief operating officer, said on Wednesday.Speaking at a conference in Phoenix, Arizona, Mr Chernin said News Corp, the media and entertainment group led by Rupert Murdoch, together with other media companies, was ?kicking the tires of pretty much all video games companies?. This included Activision, the Santa Monica-based video games publisher that is seeking a buyer, Mr Chernin said.?We see [video games] as a big business and would like to get into it,? Mr Chernin said. ?We are struggling with the gap between companies like Electronic Arts, which come with a high price tag, and the next tier of companies. These may be too focused on one or two product lines.?Electronic Arts is the world's largest video game publisher and has also recently made acquisitions, including a 20 per cent of Ubisoft, a French video game company, last month. Mr Chernin did not indicate how much News Corp might be willing to spend to enter the multi-billion video games market but said the company's large cash position gave it considerable flexibility.As well as acquisitions, News Corp was considering share buy-backs and also a transaction with Liberty Media, which owns 18 per cent of News Corp.Mr Chernin said contact had been made with Liberty, controlled by cable pioneer John Malone, but he played down its significance. ?It's an overstatement to say that negotiations have been going on,? Mr Chernin said. ?There have been one or two informal conversations.?Mr Malone last year raised his News Corp voting stake to 18 per cent, prompting News Corp to enact a poison pill measure that makes a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. Mr Chernin said the poison pill meant there was no hurry to do a deal. The issue did not have ?overwhelming urgency?.
375;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Game for an education;;"Where do video games come from? Or, more precisely, where will the next generation of video game developers come from? Until recently, people broke into the business by knowing someone, by themselves creating a variant of a current game or by becoming an intern at a games company. Such informal methods worked well while the market was in its infancy.Now, however, as the $7bn games software industry prepares for the release of new consoles and handheld devices, video game companies are beginning to form partnerships with universities to produce the next generation of game designers. And some prospective designers are looking to such courses as a way of acquiring the skills to launch their own game businesses.In March 2004 Electronic Arts, a games publisher and developer, donated $8m to the University of Southern California's School of Cinema and Television to fund a master's degree programme focused on video games. ""If we don't start today, there will be a lot of kids with great ideas who won't be able to make that next big video game,"" says Russell Rueff, executive vice-president of human resources for Electronic Arts.In December 2004, The Guildhall at Southern Methodist University graduated its first class of students with certificates in digital game development. Starting this autumn, the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy, part of the University of Central Florida, will begin operations.In January 2004, Full Sail, a Florida-based school of technology and entertainment, began offering a bachelor's degree in the entertainment business, with a specialism in games.""The students who come here want to open their own company, or be a director or on the board. We offer a business curriculum, but it is integrated, so it's not just marketing or accounting. Everything is tied into the creation of a business plan,"" says Jennifer Hill, programme director of the entertainment business bachelor of science degree.For games companies it is important to ensure a supply of trained people for both managerial and technical work. ""To conceive a video game is one thing. We also need people able to put it together,"" says Perrin Kaplan, vice-president of marketing and corporate affairs at Nintendo, a games publisher and developer.The Entertainment Technology Center at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University began offering a Masters degree in Entertainment Technology in 1999, while the Georgia Institute of Technology, which already had a bachelor and master of science degree in gaming, began offering a PhD in information design and technology in 2004. Such programmes, which offer various levels of academic and vocational content, share the common element of preparing people for the reality of the business of games: long hours, close teamwork and a relentless pressure to produce.""Most game companies tell me that the first year of an employee's time is not effective because the staff must teach them everything they need to know. The idea of sending people to a place to be battle-hardened is very attractive,"" says J. Michael Moshell, director of the digital media programme at the University of Central Florida.Teachers emphasise the difficulties of an entrepreneurial route to prospective and incoming students. ""We would recommend students take a job with a company as soon as they finish school. If they go into a venture, it's a bit risky,"" says Jason Chu, chief operating officer of DigiPen Institute of Technology, a Redmond, Washington-based school affiliated with Nintendo.Those bold enough to start up a games company require not only technical skills, but business knowhow.""We go through the various business models, how to deal with profit margins, intellectual property, incorporation, market analysis, how to budget and negotiations. If someone's going to start their own company, these are the sorts of things they'd need to understand,"" says Bob McGoldrick, technical certification co-ordinator for the High Technology Institute of Austin Community College in Texas.Linda Powers, director of human resources for games software company NCsoft, which works closely with Austin Community College, adds: ""A lot of companies want people who are only passionate about games. That's good to have, but it needs to be balanced with an understanding of the business and what it means to bring something to market.""Yet companies may have different expectations of the required skills of games degree graduates. ""We don't train people to be worker bees, we are training them to the best of their potential. We train them in getting their ideas made,"" says Tracy Fullerton, visiting assistant professor at USC's School of Cinema-Television.And in a business where sequels, sports and war titles are ubiquitous, new ideas are not always the ones that get made. As Ian Bogost, assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, puts it: ""Often you go into a game store and it is like going to a movie house and finding that the only movie available was starring Steven Seagal.""The eventual hope is that, with the help of universities, games can reach the potential so many see in them. ""To me, the interactive media [gaming] is going to be the preferred mode of human expression in the 21st century, akin to the book and radio,"" says SMU's Dr Peter Raad."
376;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-01-06T17:22:52Z;Ubisoft expected to merge with Gameloft;;Speculation about Ubisoft's most likely defence strategy switched on Thursday to a possible merger with its mobile phone games subsidiary, after the French computer games publisher and Vivendi Universal denied they were in talks about a friendly merger.Ubisoft, controlled by the five Guillemot brothers who founded it 1986, is examining all options to defend itself against Electronic Arts, the world's biggest games company, which last month became its biggest shareholder by buying a 20 per cent stake. Ubisoft called EA's purchase ?hostile?.The Guillemot family, which dominate Ubisoft's board, own 17.5 per cent of the company's shares and 26 per cent of the voting rights. They may try to boost their stake by merging Ubisoft with Gameloft, its mobile phone games subsidiary, in which they own a 79 per cent stake.A merger with Gameloft, which has a market capitalisation of ?180m ($237m), would bring the Guillemot brothers' Ubisoft stake close to a blocking minority.The founders are also examining a pact with other leading shareholders, CDC, Cr?dit Agricole and Soci?t? G?n?rale, which own about8 per cent.Shares in Ubisoft fell 3 per cent on Thursday, losing some of the ground gained on Wednesday, when it first emerged that the family-controlled games company had contacted several companies, including Vivendi, about a possible white knight deal.Vivendi said: ?In view of the rumours, Vivendi Universal denies any negotiations are taking place concerning the takeover of Ubisoft.?A few hours later, Ubisoft added: ?There are currently no negotiations with a potential partner.?EA declined to comment on Thursday, except to say that the deal protected its strategic interests. A person close to the US group said the situation was ?likely to evolve?, but no big moves were expected for several weeks.The California-based company has a $2.5bn cash pile and could easily afford to buy Ubisoft, which has a market capitalisation of less than ?500m.But analysts say EA is likely to seek a friendly deal, as hostile bids are rare in the games sector due to the danger of losing key staff.
377;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-01-06T15:27:21Z;Lex: Ubisoft/EA;;Ubisoft clearly knows a thing or two about confusing the enemy. The French video games publisher's founders control only 17.5 per cent of its capital but 26.5 per cent of the voting rights. They have pledged to resist fiercely Electronic Arts, the market leader, which bought a 19.9 per cent stake just before Christmas.Ubisoft best known for hits based on Tom Clancy thrillers has denied talks with alternative partners. But it has been sounding out Vivendi Universal and Infogrames Entertainment neither of which is a likely white knight. Vivendi has tried to sell its lossmaking games unit for years, while Infogrames is a financial basket case. In contrast, EA could clearly create value. Ubisoft's critically acclaimed game franchises would benefit from EA's marketing and development muscle. Much of Ubisoft's development is US-based, limiting integration risks.But trading at 32 times earnings, Ubisoft is hardly cheap, even by Wall Street standards. Political pressure for a French solution is mounting. Ubisoft might, for example, be able to launch a reverse takeover of Vivendi Games. This would dilute EA's stake and raise competition hurdles, while Ubisoft could probably count on state-linked banks to provide extra firepower. Such a deal looks about as logical as French concerns about a maker of US-inspired video games falling into American hands. But, as Tom Clancy puts it, the difference between fiction and reality is that fiction has to make sense..
378;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-01-06T10:28:46Z;French games sector seeks Paris aid;;Calls for the French government to protect France's struggling computer games industry grew on Wednesday after it emerged that Ubisoft had contacted Vivendi Universal about a possible friendly merger to defend itself against a takeover by Electronic Arts of the US.Speculation has intensified about the future of Ubisoft since Electronic Arts, the world's biggest computer games publisher, bought a 20 per cent stake in the French company last month, making the US group its biggest shareholder.The move provoked an aggressive reaction from family-controlled Ubisoft, which described the purchase as ?hostile? and promised to pursue all ways of protecting its independence.Ubisoft shares have almost doubled in the past month as investors anticipated a takeover. They rose more than 10 per cent to ?27.33 on Wednesday, valuing its equity at ?483m ($641m).Vivendi denied it had held takeover talks. ?In view of the rumours reported in the press, Vivendi Universal denies that any negotiations are taking place concerning the takeover of Ubisoft,? it said after markets had closed.On Thursday, Ubisoft issued a statement also denying that any talks were underway ?at this time?. The news saw Ubisoft lose some of Wednesday?s gains, falling 75 cents to ?26.75 in early trade.But the speculation about Ubisoft, along with the financial difficulties of France's two other big games groups, Infogrames and Vivendi Universal Games, have prompted industry executives to warn about the danger of France losing one of its creative industries.?Companies have chosen to live by the rules of the free market and must play by the rules of the free market,? said Bruno Bonnell, founder and chief executive of Infogrames. ?But there is a strong number of US competitors and healthy competition in Asia, so we need to keep European actors to prevent this becoming a mono-cultural industry, just as we do for cinema and music.?The French government declined to comment but is understood to be examining ways to support the games sector, such as including it in plans unveiled this week by President Jacques Chirac to invest funds from privatisations in high-growth industry.Electronic Arts has not sought board representation, but has said the Ubisoft deal allows it to ?preserve our strategic options?. An industry insider said Ubisoft had contacted several French groups about a possible white knight deal.
379;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2005-01-02T21:34:19Z;French companies lagging behind;;There are few obvious similarities between Marionnaud, the perfume retailer hit by damaging accounting errors, and Ubisoft, the computer games publisher fighting to stay independent, except that they are French.But on closer inspection they are both suffering from a complaint often found in French companies that are still controlled by their founders: poor corporate governance. While most big French corporations have taken steps to improve their boardroom representation, the concept of the independent director is still relatively new in France, compared with the UK or the US.Corporate governance in France has been strengthened by several reform efforts, such as the report by Daniel Bouton, Societe Generale chairman, who said all boards should have a majority of independent members.Yet several smaller Paris-listed companies are lagging behind. The worst cases seem to be the companies in which the founders, or their family, own a minority stake after a flotation but are reluctant to give up control.This can throw up awkward situations, like the one facing the five Guillemot brothers, who founded Ubisoft in 1986. The brothers have steadily sold their shares in the computer games publisher, to raise money and make up for the lack of dividends. By March 2004 their holding was 15 per cent, giving them 22 per cent of the voting rights.But the family still dominates the board. Yves Guillemot is chairman and chief executive, while the other board seats are occupied by his brothers, Claude, Michel, Gerard and Christian.The weakness of Ubisoft's corporate governance was exposed last month by the arrival of Electronic Arts, the world's biggest computer games company, which acquired 20 per cent of its French rival, making it Ubisoft's biggest shareholder.The Guillemot family has reacted aggressively to Electronic Arts's move, calling it ?hostile?. The brothers this week plan to meet other Ubisoft shareholders, such as state-owned bank CDC, to study a possible shareholder pact.Marionnaud is in even worse shape. The perfumery was founded by Marcel Frydman in 1984. His family still own a 22 per cent stake and 35 per cent of voting rights. But they have a vice-like grip on the company, occupying all four board seats and three of the four top executive posts.After issuing fierce denials that its accounts were wrong, Marionnaud's shares collapse after it revealed a ?97m ?accounting error? last month. Shareholders are calling for an inquiry and its banks are seeking to renegotiate its debt.The situation became more fraught after Albert Frere, the Belgian financier, revealed he had taken a 5 per cent stake. Mr Frydman is due to meet Mr Frere's representatives this week, but has said he is open to a ?friendly bid?, as long as he remains at the company.Should Mr Frere or Electronic Arts demand a drastic shake-up in the boardrooms of Marionnaud and Ubisoft respectively, it is hard to see how either of the founding families could resist.Their difficulties should be a warning to other French groups in which the founders have a similar stranglehold over the boardroom.
380;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2004-12-26T18:48:32Z;Lex: Trouble in toyland;;Muggles making magic are rarely a gratifying sight. But this year toymakers? efforts to conjure up Christmas spirit have proved even less enchanting than usual. News that J.K. Rowling has finished her latest Harry Potter book provided one of the few pleasant surprises in toyland. The Quidditch World Cup video game by Electronic Arts, Mattel?s wand-waving action figures and Lego?s Shrieking Shack all depend on Harry.However, not even the prospect of another Potter book - as well as a film next year - seems to have boosted the spirits of traditional toymakers. Mattel, the world?s leading toy manufacturer, warns darkly of the unique challenges facing its industry. Like Hasbro, its main US rival, it cautioned investors in October. Last Wednesday, struggling German dollmaker Zapf issued another profit warning, blaming weak Christmas sales. Family-owned Lego, Europe?s largest player, has been drifting in and out of losses since the late 1990s. On Wall Street, toymakers have tended strongly to under-perform the market in December. That is not so this year, but mainly because toymakers have been trailing since late spring. Their story points at broader trends, which have transformed publishing, and could spell trouble for mobile phone operators - and hold a lesson for us all.Inspect a gadgetLike children, toymakers are born optimists and slowly had to be educated out of their heresy. Management errors are partly to blame for the sector?s woes, as the successes of some smaller players show. Lego, for example, took its eyes off its trademark bricks to chase fancier film spin-offs. Rising plastics prices, a key input, add to the gloom, while last year?s price wars and pressure from the likes of Wal-Mart have left specialised retailers wary of holding inventory. The fate of the leading retailer, Toys ?R? Us, remains uncertain. Even in the best of times, putting the right toys on the shelves for Christmas is a logistical nightmare, on a par with shipping another Harry Potter tome.All this has accentuated longer-term challenges. For most parents, Christmas remains a race to see which gives out first - your money or your feet. Although reliable data are hard to come by, the indications are that parental spending per child still rises faster than income almost everywhere. But demand for parental offerings is concentrated in the US, Europe and Japan, where children have become rarer. Moreover, an ever-larger chunk of pocket money and gift budgets is spent on fancy gadgets. In 2003, video games alone accounted for $26bn out of the $85bn global toy market. For toymakers, the biggest challenge is ?age-compression?: children getting older at a younger age. Sellers have to adjust to ever-smaller age groups. Mattel?s iconic Barbie doll, for example, faces a catfight with her funkier Bratz rivals over shrinking turf.To keep up with the girls, Barbie has expanded into video games, cosmetics and films. But she faces overwhelming odds. How can a middle-aged lady - Barbie is 45 - and her rivals compete with multi-channel TV, the internet and mobile phones? It sounds pretty hopeless - rather like the world of children?s publishing before a certain boy wizard came along.Bookish magicStrolling through a bookshop, it is hard to remember that crossover fiction barely registered a decade ago. Books such as Lian Hearn?s gripping Otori trilogy, set in a fantastically medieval Japan, would have sat firmly in the adult section. Age-compression looks as much of a threat to teenage fiction as it is to toys. But for publishers of books for children the benefits far outweighed the risks, although it took the Potter phenomenon for publishers to bet on it.J.K. Rowling was famously paid a meagre advance of ?2,500 for her first book. This autumn, by contrast, Michelle Paver?s magically realist stone-age tale Wolf Brother secured a record advance of ?2.8m. The market has clearly grown. Last week, news of the publication date for the next Potter boosted the share price of Bloomsbury, its UK publisher, by 10 per cent. Bloomsbury has used its windfall to diversify. More importantly, Rowling revived tongue-in-cheek child fiction for the benefit of parents. The results can be hilarious: witness Jonathan Stroud?s Bartimaeus books featuring a deliciously irreverent djinni. They are also encouraging for toymakers.If children behave more like young adults, their tastes can have broader appeal. Pensioners are probably the fastest growing group of enthusiasts for model railways. Similarly, video games have expanded their reach to people in their thirties. However, playful consumers of all ages value choice. Video games took off among older players only when Sony opened a platform for independent game developers. And consumers are becoming even quirkier. Who would have thought that there was much of a market for a device that allows you to carry your 10,000 favourite songs in your pocket - as the iPod does?Mobile operators planning to pick much of the content for third generation telephony should take note. Today?s youngsters - their most receptive audience - might be different in many ways, but they still do not like to be told what to do. This is where the benefit of diversity lies. A key ingredient in the recent transformation of children?s publishing was that someone was eventually willing to try out Potter. That suggests a broader lesson for toyland - and beyond.As in many other sectors, conventional wisdom in the toy industry has it that consolidation is inevitable. Even Mattel only has an 8 per cent market share in traditional toys. Most of the rest is supplied by family-owned businesses, often with little regard for short-term profitability. But with tastes becoming ever more fragmented, consolidation looks like an odd solution. Size is rarely the answer when part of the challenge is to generate new ideas. In a world dominated by sophisticated entertainment giants, it was, after all, tiny Bloomsbury that stumbled on a philosopher?s stone with the power to transform its sector.
381;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2004-12-20T19:46:05Z;EA buys 20% of French rival Ubisoft;;Electronic Arts, the world's biggest computer games publisher, on Monday bought 20 per cent of Ubisoft, fuelling speculation that the US group was considering a full takeover of its smaller French rival.Shares in Ubisoft jumped 25 per cent to a six-month high of ?21.16, valuing the Paris-listed company's equity at about ?375m ($502m).Ubisoft said it had not been contacted by EA about the purchase and would view it as ?hostile? until it received more information.?As Ubisoft is the best-placed studio behind EA for next-generation gaming consoles, we think this operation is hostile, as we have an advantage which our competitors hope to acquire before it is fully valued by the market,? said Ubisoft.EA said it decided to invest in Ubisoft after being informed by Talpa Beheer, the investment vehicle of John de Mol, that the Dutch billionaire television tycoon was looking to sell his stake.?We admire Ubisoft as it has a very strong management team and good products, like Prince of Persia and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell,? said EA. ?Buying the stake lets us preserve our strategic options,? it added.EA said it had held discussions with Ubisoft's management, but would not be seeking representation on its board ?at this time?.The deal, rumoured to be worth $85m-$100m, prompted analysts to speculate whether EA was planning to acquire Ubisoft as part of plans for a big expansion of its European activities.The California-based company paid $48m for British games developer Criterion this summer. It is also rumoured to be one of several companies in talks with Eidos of the UK about a takeover.The computer games industry has long been seen as ripe for consolidation, particularly in the fragmented European market, where smaller games publishers are struggling to cover the rising costs of developing new games. ?Costs per game are going up by 25 to 30 per cent as publishers are seeing their team sizes increase to help them develop games for the next generation of consoles,? said Chris Agnew, analyst at Goldman Sachs.Ubisoft was founded in Rennes by the five Guillemot brothers in 1986. Their family still owns 15 per cent of the company and about 22 per cent of voting rights. CDC, the state-owned French bank, owns about 6 per cent.In the six months to September it made a pro forma net loss of ?43m, against ?32.1m in the year-ago period. Revenues rose slightly to ?130m.
382;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2004-11-29T19:08:50Z;Is that a game in your pocket?;;"Trip Hawkins has a big idea for online games: think small and cheap.As the founder of Electronic Arts, now the world's biggest games publisher, Mr Hawkins once set out to bring movie-quality visual effects to video games, modelling his distribution on the music industry's method of selling its products direct to retail stores.In the two decades since then, advances in desktop computing technology and the development of 3D graphics have come a long way to making that a reality.Now, says Mr Hawkins, the rules of the game are changing. The internet - particularly on mobile phones - is opening up a big new market for entertainment. But it is very different from the one that gave rise to the current $17bn (£9bn) games industry. According to this view, technology should no longer be directed towards producing ever-higher fidelity, delivering visual effects that come closer and closer to life. Other considerations have become more important.""What people want is interactivity and control,"" says Mr Hawkins. ""They're totally willing to give up fidelity to get it.""They also want to socialise. With an estimated 30m participants around the world, he says, fantasy sports leagues are proof that playing online is often more about hooking into a bigger community than finding an immersive experience.The arrival in the mass market of ""feature phones"" - handsets with colour screens and a modicum of computing power - has produced a platform that can meet these needs in new ways.""Most of daily life is this mad rush - and now you have this accidental computer you're carrying around with you,"" says Mr Hawkins.One of the games industry's visionaries, Mr Hawkins has never shied away from taking risks in his pursuit of the next big idea. After leaving Electronic Arts in 1991, he launched an ambitious effort to try to change the economics of the games console business. The company he created, 3DO, aspired to emulate Microsoft's success in the PC world by licensing its console technology to other hardware manufacturers. After that failed, an attempt to turn 3DO into a game developer also foundered.For his latest venture, Digital Chocolate, Mr Hawkins has switched his focus to the mobile phone. It is, he says, the perfect ""disruptive technology"" - a cheap and simple product that can undercut older, more sophisticated and expensive ones, creating a new way of doing business that does not fit the business models of established industry leaders.The mobile handset is disparaged as second-rate by the forces that dominate the games industry, he says. To Hollywood, it is ""a tiny TV"", while Silicon Valley sees it as ""a PC in your pocket"" and the games industry views it as a ""gimpy Gameboy"".Viewed from these perspectives, the gaming experiences it can deliver look rudimentary. Yet feature phones are going mass market. Of the 1.5bn mobile phones in use today, around 200m fall into this category, according to Mr Hawkins. Five years from now, that will have jumped to 2bn.Creating games that work on the mobile phone, while drawing on its strengths as a communications tool, means starting afresh. ""It forces us to think small and think simple,"" says Mr Hawkins.For an idea of just how small and simple, consider Bubble Ducky, a game launched by Digital Chocolate earlier this year. Players use a cartoon rubber duck to burst matching bubbles, and can then post their scores on an online message board.The appeal of the game lies partly in its extreme simplicity, says Mr Hawkins: it takes no time to learn and can be played in very little time. It also draws on the ability to connect to a wider social group. Half of the game's 20,000 paying customers post their scores online and compare themselves with other players.Such games cost virtually nothing to develop but, thanks to the viral nature of online gaming, can reach a moderate audience if they catch on. The inexpensive nature of these games also allows for frequent experimentation and a high degree of market segmentation - one of Digital Chocolate's games is aimed at children as young as two or three.It all seems a far cry from the escalating development costs and high-powered technology of the console gaming world."

They will be subsidised as aggressively as its existing 2G handset range, meaning that higher-spending users who agree to a contract will be entitled to a free phone.The phones, which will be upgraded Vodafone live! handsets - the company?s flagship phone range - will be available in Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.?Vodafone live! with 3G will become increasingly mass market next year and we expect over 10 million customers to be using Vodafone live! with 3G by March 2006 in our subsidiaries,? said Arun Sarin, chief executive.Europe?s mobile phone operators spent more than ?100bn on 3G licences and billions more on new networks, but as yet the only service to launch is 3, the service backed by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, which has had to woo customers to the new technology with cut-price voice tariffs.Vodafone?s entrance into the market is a boost to the 3G market but investors are worried that demand for the new data services will not offset rising price competition for standard voice and messaging which still account for about 96 percent of revenues.?Given Vodafone?s scale and prowess, we expect its 3G offering to be better than most. But can it offset escalating pressure in the voice and messaging services that account for 96% of revenues? We don?t think so - Vodafone?s premium to its peers looks unwarranted and we retain our Sell recommendation,? said Chris Alliott, telecoms analyst at Nomura securities.The mobile operator is aiming at the youth market, which has been influential in the growth of services such as text messaging. It hopes the key attraction will be a 3G service offering music downloads, as mobile operators look to compete with internet music download services such as Napster or Apple's iTunes.In the UK, Vodafone will charge ?1.50 for each track, representing a premium for downloading music on the move. By contrast, iTunes charges 79p a track, as does Tesco, which launched a service this week.With Apple planning a portable iPod music device incorporating wireless connectivity, some analysts expect far more music to be downloaded directly to music devices in the future. But they have expressed scepticism at Vodafone's pricing, particularly as its initial library will incorporate just 3,000 songs from MTV, Warner Music and Sony BMG, compared with 700,000 for iTunes.In an innovative move, Vodafone has created exclusive one-minute episodes of popular TV shows that can only be viewed on its 3G mobiles. In conjunction with Fox, Vodafone has created several mobile-only episodes of 24, the popular US drama starring Kiefer Sutherland, that will complement the next series.Vodafone's Fox deal follows a similar deal from 3, the mobile operator controlled by Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa. Last week it negotiated an exclusive deal with EMI to air ?Misunderstood?, the music video from Robbie Williams, a week before any TV station.
384;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2004-10-18T16:28:07Z;Penalty for Eidos amid delays to football game;;Eidos scored another own goal as the UK's biggest computer games publisher announced a delay to one of its bestselling titles Championship Manager 5, the football management simulator.CM5 was due to be published this month in time for the Christmas season, but Eidos said it was now working towards releasing the game ?shortly before Christmas, although this may extend into the new year?.Eidos had largely overcome a reputation for delivering games late until versions of its latest Lara Croft Tomb Raider game slipped last year. Lower-than-expected sales of the latest version of Hitman, its second biggest franchise, early in the summer, culminated in Eidos, in effect, putting itself up for sale.The company said it was pursuing discussions in relation to the possible sale and was ?currently in the process of selecting a preferred counterparty.?There can be no certainty at this stage whether or not this will lead to an offer being made,? it said.Several games publishers have been named as possible suitors, including Electronic Arts and THQ of the US and Ubisoft of France.Whoever might bid, Eidos shares could be picked up at about their year-low on Monday at 91?p, before closing up ?p at 93p.FT Comment?The delay to Championship Manager 5 will come as no surprise to the industry reviewers had commented on a lack of playable demonstrations and suggested the game would not be ready in time.The product is the bestselling football management simulation game, having sold more than 5m copies in 12 years. It is so addictive among soccer fans it has been cited in three divorce cases.Eidos split from Sports Interactive, its developers, last year, taking the brand with it but leaving the game's code and database of statistics. SI has produced a rival game Football Manager 2005 backed by Sega and due for release next month. Eidos's new in-house development team has clearly found it difficult to develop a game from scratch in less than a year, and Eidos now appears to have lost a key advantage in not being first to market.While UK developers create some of the bestselling games in the world, publishers such as Eidos have struggled in the face of the greater scale and resources of their rivals abroad. Hence the poor performance of Eidos's share price, despite its being up for grabs.
385;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2004-09-15T19:04:09Z;Eidos disappoints as sales talks progress;;"Eidos, the UK’s biggest computer games publisher, on Wednesday reported ""disappointing"" full-year losses and said talks that could lead to the sale of the company to a foreign buyer were progressing well.Eidos admitted in June that it lacked the scale to absorb poor sales of key titles and is widely reported to have been in takeover discussions with Electronic Arts and THQ of the US, and Ubisoft of France. EA and Ubisoft's interest is understood to have cooled.John van Kuffeler, chairman, said on Wednesday: ""Since announcing our intention to undertake a review of the strategic alternatives available to the company on June 17, we have made good progress."" But he added that there could be no certainty that ongoing discussions would lead to an offer.Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein retained their sell recommendation on the stock.They argued the company lacked the scale to be profitable over the console cycle and predicted losses could be worse next year if sales volumes failed to improve.Eidos reported sales to June 30 down 11 per cent to ( £150m (£169m) and pre-tax losses of £2m compared with a profit of £17.4m a year earlier. Losses per share were 2.1p against earnings of 13.8p.""Unexpected softness"" in the games market was blamed for 700,000 units of reorders for Hitman:Contracts, the biggest title release of the year, failing to materialise.Since then, the company has attempted to broaden the appeal of its games range with deals such as the one struck last month with Giant Interactive Entertainment to secure distribution rights to its Lego Star Wars game, which is due for release next year.FT COMMENTHitman:Contracts has sold 1.7m units but Eidos had mistakenly been shooting higher and has paid the price. Goldman Sachs sees a fair value of only 80p if Eidos remains as a stand-alone company and a premium of 15 to 25 per cent possible on the current price if it is acquired. Long-suffering shareholders will hope a buyer appears soon."
386;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
387;EA;Electronic Arts Inc;2004-09-06T18:39:15Z;Mobile content providers see clearer picture;;Investors in mobile services must be used to a roller-coaster ride as the sector has gone in and out of favour over the past half-decade. Now they may be on the upward slope.Deals signed on both sides of the Atlantic would suggest so. Mforma, the US company which claims to be the world's largest publisher of mobile entertainment content, last month agreed $40m in new finance.The financing, led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Silicon Valley venture capitalists, came just two months after Mforma raised $44m in a first round of venture capital. It should fund plans by the group whose products include a wireless game version of Frankenstein and a mobile version of Activision's Call of Duty to acquire rivals in the market for ring tones, wallpaper, games and other material.The injection of new funds followed the announcement of a $13m injection of venture capital into Digital Chocolate, a US-based mobile entertainment company founded by Trip Hawkins, originally of US video games maker Electronic Arts.Other deals completed over the past 12 months with both venture and stock market capital have involved UK, French, German and Chinese companies, as mobile companies have tried to expand into new territories. The picture is not of a return to a straightforward boom, as the turbulent share-price movements this year of listed mobile services companies such as Monstermob and Itouch have shown. Nevertheless, the overall mood does seem to have lifted. Ken Blakeslee of UK-based Webmobility Ventures, which advises a number of mobile companies, says the upturn in interest reflects the fact that the market for mobile content is finally starting to take off.Worldwide user revenues from mobile content-based services will amount to $8bn this year, up from $6.7bn in 2003, according to Strategy Analytics, a consultancy and research firm, and are set to reach $35.3bn by 2008. It says the ring-tone market alone is already worth $2bn a year.The figures reflect the continued rapid development of the worldwide mobile telephone market. More than 1.5bn people now have mobiles exceeding the combined number of PCs and TVs and this is predicted to reach 2bn in 2005.Stefan Rust, director of corporate strategy and venture investments in consumer mobile for Sun Microsystems, points out that a key development has been the wide adoption since early 2003 of the mobile version of his company's Java software, which allows mobile customers to download and use games and other entertainment.?There are already about 350m Java-enabled handsets in use around the world,? he says, ?and more than 100 carriers supporting the software.? The research firm Ovum predicts that the number of Java-enabled mobile devices will increase to 1.5bn in the next three years.The growth in consumer revenues is bolstering mobile content suppliers, according to Patrick Parodi, chair of the Mobile Entertainment Forum, the UK-based trade association which represents about 60 companies in the sector.?A lot of our members have become cashflow positive over the past two years,? he says. ?Money is flowing in the right direction.? He adds that this reflects a key attribute of the mobile industry: ?Mobile users are prepared to pay for content, so long as you can demonstrate the value. That's very different from the fixed-line internet.?The influx of investment in mobile entertainment companies began to pick up speed just under a year ago. Richard Coates, a partner in the technology, communication and entertainment practice at Ernst & Young, says that venture capital companies are looking to build portfolios of mobile entertainment investments so that the small number of successes will pay for the inevitably larger number of failures.?They want volume rather than an individual investment,? Mr Coates says. ?And they are looking for multi-stage investments maybe three or four rounds so that they can validate the business as they go along. The exit route comes either from trade consolidation, or later an IPO.?There is an analogy with the PC and games industry a few years back. Investors did not initially bet on individual games, they bet on companies. Some of these performed better than others. The more successful ones bought the less successful ones and eventually went public. It is a three- to five-year process if you go all the way to IPO. When you get out depends on whether the company you invest in is a consolidator or a consolidatee.?Experts say a venture capital company would typically be looking to get back double its investment in its portfolio over a three- to five-year period, implying an internal rate of return of 20 per cent to 33 per cent. For an early-stage investor, only one or two investments in a 10-company portfolio could be expected to come off, implying that the winners must be capable of producing returns of 10-fold to 20-fold.Mr Rust of Sun Microsystems concludes: ?Many of these companies are making money today. Maybe not as much as they promised their investors, but still cash positive. In the fixed-line internet space, this took five years.?
