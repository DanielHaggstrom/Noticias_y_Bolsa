0;COG;Cabot Oil & Gas Corp;2017-06-19T19:27:02Z;EQT and Rice in $6.7bn gas producer tie-up;Largest deal in US upstream oil and gas production industry for almost three years;EQT Corporation has agreed to acquire Rice Energy in a $6.7bn deal that will combine two of the leading producers in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale to become the largest natural gas producer in the US.In the largest transaction in the US upstream oil and gas production industry for almost three years, the deal will give Rice shareholders 0.37 shares of EQT and $5.30 in cash for every share, the two companies said in a statement. EQT will take on about $1.5bn of net debt as part of the deal.The offer represents a 37 per cent premium on Rice’s undisturbed stock price. The companies expect that the deal will generate cost and capital synergies worth about $2.5bn, according to one person with knowledge of the terms. EQT shares fell nearly 7 per cent after the deal was announced, while Rice’s shares rose 27 per cent.The deal is the largest in the US industry since Encana of Canada bought Texas-based oil producer Athlon Energy for $6.8bn in September 2014, just as the slump in commodity prices was beginning. Analyst expectations that the industry downturn would lead to a wave of consolidation have proved largely unfulfilled.However, there has been an upturn in deals this year, as rising energy prices have led companies to make acquisitions to fill gaps created when commodity prices plummeted. More than 20 oil and gas deals worth nearly $92bn have been agreed in the US this year, up from $40bn during the same period in 2016, according to Dealogic.Rice was the 16th-largest gas producer in the US last year, and principally operates in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, North America’s largest gasfield, and the Utica shale in Ohio.EQT, the fifth-largest gas producer in the US, is also centred on the Marcellus Shale, but also has other assets in states including Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.Steve Schlotterbeck, EQT’s chief executive, said: “Rice has built an outstanding company with an acreage footprint that is largely contiguous to our existing acreage, which will provide substantial synergies and make this transaction significantly accretive in the first year.”Rice floated on the New York Stock Exchange in January 2014, about six months before the oil price slump began, but by last Friday’s close its shares had lost only about 6 per cent from the IPO. Over that period they have also outperformed shares in other leading Marcellus gas producers including Cabot Oil & Gas, Range Resources and EQT itself.Rice said last month that it planned to increase production from its core Pennsylvania and Ohio assets by an annual average of 27-33 per cent over 2017-19.However, Rice was still outspending its operating cash flows on drilling and completing new wells. It does not expect to be able to cover those costs from its own cash flows until 2019.EQT said in April it would be close to covering its planned $1.5bn of capital spending in the Marcellus this year with $1.3bn of operating cash flow.The new combined company will be led by EQT’s management, but the Rice family will continue to have a board seat in the new combined entity, said two people informed about the situation.The deal, which obtained the approval of both boards, is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2017, the companies said.Citigroup acted as financial adviser to EQT, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as legal adviser. Barclays Capital acted as financial adviser to Rice Energy and Vinson & Elkins acted as legal adviser.
1;COG;Cabot Oil & Gas Corp;2016-09-26T15:38:51Z;US gas: Global market, local problems;The north-east is producing huge amounts of fuel from shale formations but environmentalists have vowed to halt pipelines;Cabot Oil & Gas once had six rigs drilling in Pennsylvania. Now there is one. The company is a prolific natural gas producer in the Marcellus shale, the hydrocarbon-drenched rock beneath the Appalachian mountains. Exploration in places like Cabot’s acreage in rural Susquehanna County transformed the US north-east from a footnote in gas markets to a source larger than Qatar.But it also led to a glut that caused gas prices to crash. Cabot’s lone green rig, flying a tattered US flag, is boring more wells, adding to the surfeit. So gas companies have embraced a new challenge: moving the fuel to where the people are.“We’re bringing more to the surface than we ever thought possible,” says George Stark, external affairs director for Cabot, en route to the hilltop drilling site. “But we don’t have the necessary capacity to take it away. Now we’re talking to pipeliners: ‘Could you take our gas away?’”The shale industry has started what it calls Marcellus 2.0 — an all-out push to market the region’s gas. This will involve selling the virtues of gas to power companies and factories, but the main thrust will be laying pipelines up and down the east coast. At a shale gas conference in Pittsburgh last week — headlined by Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate — a key theme was “connecting the marketplace through infrastructure”.There is just one hitch: the east contains some of the US’s most densely settled areas. While these towns represent a huge potential market they are prickly over the idea of hazardous infrastructure running beneath their land. Pipeline companies accustomed to having their way in Texas have received a harsh welcome in states such as New York and Connecticut. Amid rising controversy, billions of dollars of projects have been delayed, denied or cancelled.“The farther north and east you go, the more challenging it becomes. I think it’s a combination of population and the organised environmental consciousness,” says Bill Yardley, president of US transmission at Spectra Energy, a Houston-based operator of some of the biggest pipelines in the north-east.For years, the unconventional drilling that propelled the increase in gas output in the north-east has been criticised by environmentalists worried about water supply and air quality.But the issue of pipelines has brought together a broader group of opponents, from landowners upset about companies using compulsory purchase (known as “eminent domain” in the US), to open-space advocates wanting to preserve habitat, to climate campaigners aiming to keep fossil fuels beneath ground.The fierce opposition comes after years in which natural gas was viewed as a weapon in the war on carbon emissions. Burning gas emits about half the carbon dioxide of coal. As shale production drove down prices, gas took the place of coal at power plants and contributed to a 12 per cent decline in US energy-related carbon emissions between 2005 and 2015, according to the Energy Information Administration.As recently as 2014, President Barack Obama was hailing gas as a “bridge fuel” to wean the US off more polluting sources as it adopted clean technologies such as solar and wind power. Until 2010 the Sierra Club, a US environmental group, was promoting gas as part of its Beyond Coal campaign, an effort partly funded by Chesapeake Energy, a leading Marcellus producer.These days, Sierra Club chapters are the nemeses of the pipeline companies. Mr Obama outlined a diminished role for gas when he unveiled a climate plan last year, favouring renewable energy instead. Leaks of methane, the main component of natural gas, from wells, pipelines and distribution systems have received more scrutiny, as it is 84 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.Now that low gas prices have slowed the fracking boom — 22 rigs are drilling in Pennsylvania, down from 109 five years ago, according to services company Baker Hughes — environmentalists have booted up their own version of Marcellus 2.0. Their target: pipelines.“If you can stop a pipeline, you’re kind of cutting the industry off at its knees,” says Karen Feridun of Berks Gas Truth, an activist group in Berks county, Pennsylvania. The movement was energised by the Obama administration’s rejection last year of Keystone XL , the proposed crude oil pipeline from Canada. This month the White House halted construction of Dakota Access, an oil pipeline, on federal land.“If we go ahead and build out our natural gas infrastructure, we have no chance of dealing with climate change. The Marcellus is a huge global warming machine,” says Bill McKibben, founder of the 350.org climate change group who led the fight against Keystone XL.Production from the Marcellus and Utica shales of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio has been nothing short of astonishing. Volumes reached 22bn cubic feet a day in February, a 17-fold rise in less than a decade. After it began liquefied natural gas exports from shale this year, the US now competes with Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG exporter.“The growth in the Marcellus shale has brought the US into the global market for natural gas,” says Eric Brooks, energy analyst at Platts Analytics.Pipelines have historically run south to north across the US to serve the big urban markets. In 1951 the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line reached West 134th Street in Manhattan, bringing supplies from Texas to New York City. Now, Transco’s owner, Williams, is investing billions to allow the pipe to also run north to south.A study for the industry-backed INGAA Foundation estimates that between 2015 and 2035 the US will lay 18,000-29,000 miles of transmission pipeline, plus up to 179,000 miles of smaller gathering lines which fetch gas from wells. The US is already home to more than 300,000 miles of transmission lines, equal to 120 trips between New York and Los Angeles.In Pennsylvania, gas gathering lines alone are on track to cover 1 per cent of the land area by 2030, according to a pipeline task force. “We are in the midst, obviously, of a wave of energy development that is unlike any other in the state’s history,” John Quigley, then Pennsylvania environment secretary, said last year.The state, the map of which is dotted with place names such as Oil City and Carbon County, has a long history of producing energy. Not all residents are thrilled by the latest boom, however.Denis McNamee and his wife retired to a farmhouse overlooking a meadow in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania. In February, the Constitution Pipeline company threatened him with a contempt of court ruling after he refused to allow its contractors to cut trees on his land. Now his garden is thick with felled birch and stakes tied with pink ribbons, marking the pipeline’s path, 200ft from his porch. “I call it eminent disdain. It’s been that way from day one,” he says.It had been proposed that the $1bn Constitution line, led by Williams and 25 per cent owned by Cabot, would run 126 miles from Pennsylvania to New York state. The project has federal approval but in April New York governor Andrew Cuomo’s administration denied it the necessary water permits, halting progress. The venture’s backers have appealed in court.In central Pennsylvania, Williams is awaiting federal approval for Atlantic Sunrise, a $3bn, 183-mile pipeline that would feed shale gas south into the Transco pipeline. Cabot has committed to using capacity on the line, helping it deliver to customers, including one that would ship LNG to Japan.“Why should people be losing their property when this is going to be exported?” says Ann Pinca, an activist in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. Williams has already stacked acres of pipe near the Atlantic Sunrise right of way, aiming to put it in service by late next year.The schedule for the PennEast pipeline, which would run from Pennsylvania to the New Jersey suburbs, has slipped to late 2018 following resistance from local officials and environmentalists. On Friday its developers made 33 route changes but the New Jersey Sierra Club was unmoved. Shirley Turner, a New Jersey state senator, warns that the line would cross open space preserved with taxpayer funds. “This will turn out to be money wasted if we don’t stop that pipeline now,” she said at a rally last month.If we go ahead and build out our natural gas infrastructure, we have no chance of dealing with climate changeIn Boston, the police say 137 people have been arrested this year while protesting against a new section of Spectra’s Algonquin pipeline, including Karenna Gore, a daughter of former vice-president Al Gore. In August, the Massachusetts supreme court invalidated a policy allowing gas utilities to pass the cost of pipeline projects to their customers, a setback for the Access Northeast project led by Spectra, which recently agreed to be acquired by Enbridge of Canada.Interstate gas projects must receive approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It has authorised 887 miles of gas pipelines this year but does not keep figures for schemes it has not approved. Even as Ferc approves projects, state and regional authorities have become more receptive to pipeline adversaries.“Permitting issues are becoming a bigger problem everywhere,” says Frank Ferazzi, general manager of Williams’ eastern interstate pipelines. Environmental groups, he adds, are “well-funded, they’re well-organised and they’ve been extremely active”.The energy industry says gas makes an inappropriate target because it can quickly generate power when solar or wind resources are lacking. And when cold weather grips New England, the region relies on foreign LNG and fuel oil to run its power plants. “The opposition has created an environment where we’re burning more oil in the middle of winter in order to serve electric generators,” says Spectra’s Mr Yardley.Some in the environmental community acknowledge that gas is an improvement on oil and coal, and a crucial backstop for renewables. But they say that a pipeline building spree would lock in consumption for decades, undermining gas’s usefulness as a “bridge” fuel leading to cleaner technologies. Jonathan Peress of the Environmental Defense Fund points out that a typical gas pipeline can last 50 years or more, with financing backed by long-term contracts.Investors warn that a rush to build could leave too many pipes. Matt Sallee, portfolio manager at $15bn fund manager Tortoise Capital Advisors, says that while the north-east suffers “very constrained” pipelines today, those on the drawing board could lift capacity well above anticipated production levels.“If everything gets built, would we be oversupplied?” he asks. “The answer is yes.”When Donald Trump addressed a shale gas conference in Pittsburgh last week, he said fossil fuel infrastructure projects were mired in a “regulatory limbo”.“Now if I’m president, they’ll happen quickly. I can tell you that,” the Republican presidential nominee told the crowd. “Happen very quickly — you’ll be amazed how quickly they’ll happen.”Such pledges will not necessarily help Mr Trump win Pennsylvania — a key battleground state where Hillary Clinton is leading the polls. The state’s stunning growth in energy production has taken place far from voters. About 55,000 people worked in natural gas extraction or industries that serve it during the first quarter of 2016, according to the state’s latest estimate. That is less than 1 per cent of all non-farm jobs in Pennsylvania.Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll, says the gas industry fails to rank as an issue because wells and equipment are in rural areas. “It’s out of sight, out of mind,” he says.Now that more pipelines are moving gas to cities, the industry is increasingly visible. “You have people who live near several of these things and they don’t have time to handle everything coming at them at once,” says Alex Bomstein, senior attorney at the Clean Air Council in Philadelphia.Mrs Clinton asserted this year that after she imposed new regulations as president there would not be “many places in America where fracking will continue to take place”.However, the Democratic candidate’s campaign website says gas “can play an important role” in reducing energy costs and pollution. It says she promotes financing for pipelines that would help households abandon heating oil as a winter fuel.
2;COG;Cabot Oil & Gas Corp;2016-08-25T13:41:06Z;US shale hotspot defies doldrums with near record output;Production jump proves a surprise as drilling rigs have fallen;The foremost shale gas region in the US is bucking the energy market doldrums, with production this month approaching a new record.Natural gas output from the Marcellus and Utica shales of the US north-east is averaging 22.63bn cubic feet per day in August, according to Platts Analytics. That is up 2 per cent from July and the most since February’s all-time high of 22.78bn cu ft/d.The reversal is defying expectations of a steady production decline as the commodities slump forces energy companies to curtail drilling. The north-east in the past several years emerged as what Credit Suisse called “the key growth engine” of US gas production, helping put the country on the global energy map as a gas exporter.“Right now we’re actually seeing higher production than in the past few months,” said Eric Brooks, energy analyst at Platts Analytics, a unit of S&P Global Platts. “It was the exact opposite of what everyone was anticipating.”The US government forecast that combined gas output from the two shale areas lying beneath Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia would decline until at least September.But producers have managed to maintain volumes by tapping inventories of drilled but uncompleted wells and burrowing deeper, longer wells that yield more gas. Even though the number of drilling rigs has declined, new production per rig now averages about 11.4m cubic feet of gas in the Marcellus, an 18 per cent improvement from a year ago, according to Energy Information Administration figures.Chesapeake Energy, a leading gas producer, raised production guidance “driven primarily by gas volume increases” in the Marcellus and another shale region, it recently told investors. Cabot Oil & Gas, a big Marcellus producer, said its output would remain roughly flat between the second and third quarter of 2016, while competitor Range Resources eyed a slight rise in production.Production has been robust despite regional prices that are exceptionally soft. Intercontinental Exchange indices show gas at the Dominion South trading hub in Pennsylvania sold for $1.2757 per million British thermal units this month, less than half the price for benchmark gas in Louisiana, as producers, merchants and utilities jockey over a limited pipeline system.Gas marketers typically inject excess supply into reservoirs in summertime for withdrawal during the winter heating season.Mr Brooks said the recent surge of supply may reflect a push to sell gas before storage operators begin to ration space in their reservoirs.Even though the region’s gas prices have been low, producers also remember last winter — typically the period of peak demand — when the Dominion South market sank to as little as $0.50 per mBtu.“Time and again, the producers have proven how nimble they are and how willing they are to produce in a low-price environment,” Mr Brooks said.
3;COG;Cabot Oil & Gas Corp;2015-12-08T15:32:54Z;US gas prices nosedive on warmer weather;January-delivered futures contract at 17-year low as mild temperatures undercut forecast consumption;January is usually among the most expensive months to buy US natural gas. But next month is shaping up to be the cheapest thanks to unseasonal warm weather.Wholesale gas for January 2016 delivery has nosedived, dropping 6.3 per cent so far this week to just above $2 per million British thermal units. The price was the lowest for any January-delivered futures contract in 17 years, exchange records show.The crash is turning heads in energy markets because the US, where nearly half of all households heat with gas, is on the cusp of winter. An exceptionally warm start to the season has undercut forecast gas consumption, however.Mild temperatures across big northern cities such as New York and Chicago are one effect of the El Niño event that is under way in the Pacific Ocean. Globally, the year 2015 is likely to be the warmest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.In October and November, the number of gas-weighted heating degree days, a yardstick for energy consumption, was about a fifth less than normal. The National Weather Service sees above-normal temperatures persisting to February across the continental US.The traditional pattern is for US gas use to soar in January. “It’s usually the highest month for consumption out of the year,” said Katie Teller, economist at the US Energy Information Administration.But Nymex January 2016 gas on Tuesday was trading at $2.048 per m Btu, 48 per cent lower than the contract’s price a year ago. Gas for delivery next spring, when heating demand should be soft, cost significantly more than the January contract.The price was the weakest for any January futures contract since December 1998, when the January 1999 contract closed at $1.765 per m Btu. The previous low followed the last powerful El Niño event of 1997-98. Then, heating degree days were tracking higher than they are today, said Matt Rogers, president of Commodity Weather Group.Meanwhile, gas output from areas such as the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania and Utica of Ohio has kept rising in spite of lower prices. Spot gas for Tuesday delivery at the Dominion South market in the Marcellus was $1.3412, according to Intercontinental Exchange.“We have a ton of supply and there’s still expectations for a relatively warm winter to continue,” Ms Teller said.Teri Viswanath, gas analyst at BNP Paribas, said the washout was especially significant for producers, which customarily take advantage of higher winter gas prices to lock in future sales.Shares of the biggest US gas producers suffered, with Chesapeake Energy down 7.7 per cent, Cabot Oil & Gas off 1.7 per cent and EQT off 2.9 per cent this week to Tuesday.
4;COG;Cabot Oil & Gas Corp;2015-05-15T07:43:45Z;Relief for investors as profit fears ease;Pressure on results lifted as dollar retreats and oil price rises;Fears that profits at the largest US publicly traded companies would significantly retreat during the first half of the year have eased, after a string of better than expected results from a range of corporations, including an energy sector hit by the oil price rout.First-quarter earnings have now turned positive, removing some uncertainty facing US investors, after analysts had downgraded forecasts by the most since the financial crisis because of a sharp rally in the dollar and a drop in energy prices.We are trying to figure out where [revenue] growth is. It’s sort of like whack-a-mole — we’re not seeing consistent growth across the globeFor S&P 500 companies, blended earnings — a measure of quarterly results already announced and projections for the roughly 40 companies due to release figures over the coming month — are set to grow 0.2 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, against projections at the beginning of April for a fall of as much as 4.8 per cent, according to FactSet.However, the earnings growth is expected to be the slowest since the third quarter of 2012. JPMorgan analysts note that growth was roughly 9.2 per cent in the first quarter when stripping out energy.“You had a sort of typical pattern over the past five years where companies have done a good job of managing expectations,” said Russ Koesterich, BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist. “The dollar strengthened, which got people worried about international exposure.”Revenues, meanwhile, were lacklustre in the first quarter and are expected to deteriorate in the second, with estimates compiled by FactSet pointing to a 4.7 per cent year-on-year decline in S&P 500 sales.“The S&P 500’s strongest headwind this year is the lack of revenue growth,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank. “We are trying to figure out where the growth is. It’s sort of like whack-a-mole — we’re not seeing consistent growth across the globe.”Stocks have since returned to record levels, hitting the seventh closing high of the year on Thursday. However, strategists across Wall Street have cautioned that the recent moves have little to do with the earnings season, pointing instead to a calming in fixed income markets and a bounce in the euro and pound.4.8%Fall in ‘blended’ earnings forecast at the beginning of April, according to FactSetA so-called profit recession, in which earnings decline for two consecutive quarters, has also not been ruled out. The oil price rout is expected to cut nearly two-thirds off earnings at energy companies in the second quarter, dragging overall S&P 500 earnings 4.3 per cent lower.David Bianco, a strategist with Deutsche Bank, noted that even with a “normal 3 per cent beat, second-quarter earnings per share will be down slightly to flat from a year ago”.However, a 43 per cent jump in Brent, the international oil benchmark, has helped to reduce some of the obstacles facing US multinationals.Energy companies made up three of the five S&P 500 corporates to beat earnings by the greatest margin in the first three months of the year, the FactSet data showed, with both Cabot Oil & Gas and Consol Energy reporting profits twice as high as analysts had expected.“A lot of the concern was the strength in the value of the dollar, and the dollar has started to retreat from the highs. And oil prices have started to move higher and there is the potential that they have bottomed,” said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments.“If that is the case, earnings expectations have to be revised.”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
5;COG;Cabot Oil & Gas Corp;2014-12-09T18:08:39Z;US shale industry faces endurance test after Opec rejects cuts;Cartel’s refusal to cut oil output turns screw on US crude producers;"When Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries last month rejected calls for a production cut by Opec, the oil cartel, they put the responsibility for stabilising plummeting crude prices on to the US shale industry. Suhail al-Mazroui, energy minister for the United Arab Emirates, said US shale companies and other producers who had created an oil glut should “respect the needs of the market”. Less diplomatically, Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the leading shale oil producers, said Opec had “declared war” on the US industry.Two weeks on from that Opec decision — and against a backdrop of a 40 per cent fall in the oil price since June — evidence of its negative impact on US producers is starting to emerge.Rather than a war, the US shale industry is braced for a test of endurance. As the pressure on oil producers mounts, weak companies face the threat of dwindling investment, faltering production, forced asset sales and possible bankruptcy.The successful companies will be the ones that both entered the downturn in the strongest position and are most effective at improving their efficiency. They can hope to make it through to better days when the oil price recovers and are also likely to be able to pick up some undervalued assets.On Monday ConocoPhillips, the US’s largest exploration and production company, unveiled plans to cut its capital spending by about 20 per cent next year to $13.5bn — a steeper reduction than analysts had expected — and said it would defer drilling programmes in several North American shale areas.Last Friday Baker Hughes, the energy services group due to be bought by rival Halliburton, published data which showed the number of rigs drilling for oil in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas had fallen by 16 since October to 190. The number of rigs in the Bakken shale and related North Dakota formations had meanwhile dropped by 10 to 188.Also last week Drillinginfo, a consultancy, published figures showing that the number of new permits to drill wells had fallen by about 30 per cent in both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford areas last month compared with October. That may overstate the likely drop in activity, because companies will have a backlog of permits they can use, but it is clear the industry is responding to a steep drop in the oil price.Allen Gilmer, Drillinginfo’s chief executive, said: “Because production from shale wells comes on fast and drops off fast, their economics are more exposed to short-term prices.” This applies more than for other types of oil production, where projects can take many years to come on stream, activity and output from shale can be stepped up and down quickly.New extraction techniques and high oil prices boost US oil productionWhile all shale companies are under pressure, their responses to the declining oil price will often be different. The companies vary widely in terms of debt levels, financing, hedging against price falls, product mix, location and quality of their assets and operational efficiency, and those differences have been reflected in share price movements over the past six months.One important issue for companies is their gas production. From 2010 until this summer, many US shale companies were shifting away from natural gas and towards more lucrative oil production.But now gas is back in favour. It has fallen less than oil and is likely to rebound if there is a cold winter in the US. As a result, the shares of gas-focused companies such as Cabot Oil and Gas have often been less affected than their more oil-focused peers.Another critical factor is debt. The shale surge has been built by borrowing: companies have typically spent more on drilling and completing wells than they have generated in cash flows and over the past decade about $163bn worth of high-yield debt has been issued by US oil and gas producers. Some have relied much more heavily on debt than others, however.If US crude were to average about $70 per barrel next year, EOG Resources and Anadarko Petroleum would have debts roughly equal to a year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation — a very comfortable level, according to analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt, the investment bank. Other larger companies including Marathon Oil, Apache, Devon Energy and Chesapeake Energy also have debt burdens that seem manageable.At the other end of the scale, companies such as Laredo Petroleum, SandRidge Energy and Range Resources would have debts about four times their ebitda, according to Tudor Pickering, while for Ultra Petroleum, Exco Resources, Goodrich Petroleum and Halcon Resources the multiple would be even higher.Beyond the financial metrics, the quality of a company’s assets is also important. Some of the companies that are focused on the Bakken shale, including Continental Resources and Whiting Petroleum, have been out of favour with investors, but the early evidence from rig activity and drilling permits is that there is no one “play” — as the different geological formations are known — that has been worse affected than any other.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingMore than the broad region where a company operates, it can be the quality of its specific lease areas within the region that matters, according to Cody Rice of Wood Mackenzie, another consultancy. In an area such as the Eagle Ford, companies in the core where the rocks are most productive can continue to thrive, he says, “but if you’re underperforming your peers, and you’re not in the core of the play, it’s not going to be so good for you”.The other crucial variable is operational performance. Reid Morrison, the advisory leader for US energy at PwC, the accounting firm, says that up until this summer there was very little focus on efficiency in the shale industry. When he tried to advise on cost savings, “the reaction we were getting was: ‘We agree with that, but it’s not important right now’,” he says. “There was a lot of confidence that the new floor for the oil price was around $90 per barrel.” Now that view has changed completely: interest in ideas for cost savings is soaring.Market upheaval: Unwelcome newcomer is likely here to stayWhen Opec members talk about the US contribution to world “oversupply”, they are referring to the growth in US crude production of about 4m barrels per day, about 80 per cent, since 2008. US shale has caused an upheaval in oil markets, and many rival producers, in Russia as well as Opec, hope it will go away.The existence of a group of financially strong shale companies such as EOG Resources and Devon Energy, however, suggests that the US industry is not about to crumble. They have been covering their capital spending from cash flow generation, unlike many of their rivals, and have little debt. They may cut capex next year, but do not face pressure to make deep reductions.Any good US shale assets owned by companies that cannot afford to develop them are likely to be picked up by financially stronger groups. If these can drive down costs, helped by increased spare capacity in the energy services industry, the oil prices needed for development to be commercially attractive could be lower than previous estimates have suggested.Many investors will suffer losses on exposure to oil and gas if prices stay at current levels. But some analysts expect the overall impact on US oil production to be relatively modest.“The rate of increase in production is going to slow down,” says Philip Verleger, an energy economist. “Even at $50 oil, though, US production probably plateaus, but it doesn’t start going down.”"
6;COG;Cabot Oil & Gas Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Mid-sized independents riding high on shale oil success;;While it was a downbeat quarter for the majors, things looked much rosier for the midsized independents, which are riding high on a wave of shale oil success.EOG Resources, which has positions in two big shale plays, North Dakota’s Bakken and the Eagle Ford in South Texas, says it is expecting to increase crude oil production by 35 per cent this year.In contrast, ExxonMobil has said its production will fall in 2013 for a second straight year.In many ways the comparison is unfair. EOG has a market value of $42.5bn, while Exxon’s is $406bn. EOG’s production of 506,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day pales into comparison with Exxon’s 4.1m.But that isn’t stopping investors drawing parallels between the two – often to the detriment of the majors.“The smaller companies are beating them into a pulp when it comes to results,” says Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer and Co.EOG is not the only one piquing investors’ interest. Shares in Cabot Oil & Gas, which has operations in the Eagle Ford and Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale, and expects production to grow by as much as 54 per cent this year, have risen 77 per cent over the past 12 months.Oil majors such as Exxon and Shell also have big shale positions. But they seem to be less successful at developing them than the specialised exploration and production companies, or E & Ps. Shell just announced a big writedown of its US shale oil assets.“E & Ps, even very large-cap ones, have greater flexibility to shift corporate strategy in favour of higher returns,” says Eric Gordon of Brown Advisory. He cites the example of Occidental, which late last year slowed down the pace of its investments in the US in order to cut operating and capital costs. The move was successful, improving returns on capital and boosting the company’s share price.In contrast, the majors have seen declining returns amid increasing capital spending and diminishing profit expectations. The market will continue to punish them, he says, until this trend reverses. “In a rising global market, these equities seem doomed for underperformance,” he says.

The decline is ominous for producers such as Cabot seeking to maximise returns on the wells they drill. It also threatens to turn a gentle slide in the broader natural gas market into an avalanche, hurting commodity investors who allocate money to US gas futures.The Marcellus field is enormous. The US Energy Information Administration last week more than doubled its reserve estimate for the region to 31.9tn cubic feet as companies use horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to break open shale rocks and liberate trapped gas. This is nearly a quarter of total US shale gas reserves.Supply from Marcellus states such as Pennsylvania and West Virginia has been climbing even as production from other shale fields has levelled off. Gross production is up 45 per cent so far this year from the same period in 2012, according to Bentek Energy. In the Haynesville shale straddling Louisiana and Texas, production is down 21 per cent year on year.The Marcellus has “almost single-handedly been making up for the small declines everywhere else in the country,” says Vikas Dwivedi, energy analyst at Macquarie.In 2009, when the Marcellus started producing, US gas prices averaged about $4 per million British thermal units. They now are about $3.30. Yet companies have been enticed by the relatively low cost of drilling wells in the Marcellus and the valuable hydrocarbon liquids it also yields.The wells there are prolific. Range Resources, a leading driller in the region, is spacing them more densely and extending bores thousands of feet underground to increase gas recovery. The company expects to increase production by 20-25 per cent a year.“Marcellus has unbounded production potential. The only thing that’s limiting its potential is infrastructure constraints,” says Mr Dwivedi, whose bank is also the fourth-biggest North American gas marketer by volume.Marcellus has unbounded production potential. The only thing that’s limiting its potential is infrastructure constraintsThese infrastructure limitations – mainly inadequate pipeline and processing capacity – have bottled up some gas and cratered prices in the region. Last Friday, gas at a Pennsylvania trading hub called TGP Zone 4-Marcellus sold for as little as $1 a mBtu – a discount of more than $2 to benchmark prices.Extreme “basis” differences such as these were what led Cabot, a leading independent driller, to put together a special presentation on Marcellus gas marketing for investors last month. As the difference widened in July, Cabot’s gas sold for a 15-cent discount to futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, said Dan Dinges, chief executive.Even with this discount, Mr Dinges was quick to add that Cabot’s typical Marcellus well provides a “120 per cent return”. The company just added a sixth drilling rig in the Marcellus and lifted production there to 1.2bn cu ft a day.The burgeoning supply inside the Marcellus is swaying prices elsewhere in the country. The Boston market usually trades at a hefty premium to attract shipments to the gas-short city. Thanks in part to plentiful gas nearby, Boston is now about equal to benchmark prices.Prices are down due to mild temperatures. But if the Marcellus is robust and outpacing expectations, it will tend to damp upside risk to prices across the countryEventually the Marcellus will start to affect prices at the Henry hub, the pipeline junction in Louisiana that is the delivery point for Nymex gas futures traded by everyone from utilities to asset managers. Henry hub prices are down 17 per cent from the start of June as comfortable weather curbs air-conditioning demand in the northern US.Biliana Pehlivanova, head of natural gas and power research at Barclays, says: “It’s generally adding to bearish sentiment. For now, prices are down due to very mild temperatures. But in the longer term, if the Marcellus is robust and outpacing people’s expectations, it will tend to damp upside risk to prices across the country.”Pipeline companies may even start to “backhaul” excess volumes southward to the energy-rich Gulf of Mexico area that the EIA still quaintly calls the “producing region,” a relic of the days before the shale boom.Mr Dwivedi says: “It’s going to have a big impact. It’s just too much production, and eventually pipelines will be reversed to take Marcellus gas back into Henry hub. This is flipping the gas market on its head from a few years ago.”
8;COG;Cabot Oil & Gas Corp;2013-02-22T22:18:55Z;US stocks record first weekly loss this year;;US stocks recorded their first losing week of the new year after the Federal Reserve revealed divided views on quantitative easing among its officials, prompting the first significant investor sell-off of equity holdings in 2013.Overall, the US benchmark declined 0.3 per cent for the week to 1,515.60 despite paring some of its losses on Friday.The weekly loss snapped a seven-week run higher for US stocks that has boosted the S&P 500 by 6.3 per cent so far this year.Wall Street’s fear gauge, measured by the CBOE Vix index, saw its biggest single day jump in more than a year this week as investors sought protection against a potential fall in the S&P 500. The CBOE Vix index, which tracks implied volatility on the benchmark, rose 13.7 per cent to reach 14.2.“The number one comment I hear from institutional investors is that central bank liquidity has been flowing from the bond markets and into riskier assets, and chief among those has been stocks,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx.“So much of the baseline assumptions for equities are anchored on a highly accommodative US central bank that it is hard to imagine how this transition would work,” he added.The concern, namely that the US central bank would slow down its monetary stimulus measures earlier than expected, was further exacerbated this week by signs that the US economy remained sluggish.Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by revenues, said its sales in recent weeks had cooled after an increase to payroll taxes paid by US consumers had sapped spending.Shares in the company, however, gained 1.6 per cent to $70.40 for the week. The company’s gains came as investors fled into defensive sectors, moving out of cyclical industries tied to the global economy.The consumer staples sector, of which Walmart is a constituent, was the week’s best performing industry measure on the S&P 500 and climbed 1.7 per cent.Meanwhile, materials sector stocks were the hardest hit and lost 3 per cent for the week. Miner Freeport-McMoRan dropped 7.4 per cent to $32.45 and iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources fell 8.3 per cent to $26.47.The losses for the S&P 500 also came as investors also remained concerned about $1.2tn in looming budget cuts that Washington policy makers were set to begin debating formally next week.Stronger-than-expected results from PC maker Hewlett-Packard helped buoy investors’ confidence in the week’s final trading session. Shares in HP climbed 14.4 per cent to $19.20 with most of its gains coming late in the week.For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 14,000.57. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1 per cent to 3,161.82.Homebuilders were among the week’s weakest stocks despite positive data from the sector that showed the number of new home starts hit a four-year high in January. Toll Brothers lost 6.7 per cent to $34.59 after the US luxury homebuilder said fewer deliveries and lower selling prices hampered its latest quarter.Michael Kors retreated from its recent all-time highs after insiders sold $1.6bn worth of shares in the US fashion group in a secondary public offering. The company lost 6.6 per cent to $59.11. Elsewhere, Abercrombie & Fitch lost 8.1 per cent to $46.86 after the youth fashion retailer said international same-store sales had declined in its latest quarter.VeriFone Systems dropped 42.2 per cent for the week to $18.92 as the maker of credit card processing systems said it would fall short of recent earnings projections for the fourth-quarter and had struggled to shift its primarily hardware-based business into services.Shares in US insurer AIG, which rose 0.3 per cent for the week to $38.45, replaced Apple as the most owned stock by hedge funds according to a report by Goldman Sachs. The company reported a net loss of $4bn in its latest quarter, which it said had been adversely affected by superstorm Sandy.Apple fell 2 per cent to $450.81 on the week as the battle between hedge fund manager David Einhorn and the technology group over its cash holdings continued.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

13;COG;Cabot Oil & Gas Corp;2012-01-24T19:00:28Z;Chesapeake tackles oversupply issue;Move may signal others to do same;"Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake Energy’s ebullient chief executive, has a nice turn of phrase when discussing his company’s principal product. Natural gas, he reportedly said, is not oversupplied in the US; it is under-demanded.He has backed that argument with efforts to increase the use of gas for power generation and road transport, extolling its benefits for pollution and energy security.In the face of gas prices that fell last week to a ten-year low, however, Chesapeake accepted that the supply side of the equation would have to move, too. On Monday, it announced a planned 8 per cent cut in gas production and a 67 per cent cut in the number of rigs drilling gas wells, from an average of 75 in use last year to 24 by the second quarter of this year.The market reacted positively to the news, sending the February gas future price up 7.8 per cent on Monday and a further 2.4 per cent on Tuesday morning. Shares in Chesapeake and other US gas companies such as Range Resources, Southwestern Energy and Cabot Oil & Gas also rose.However, analysts believe that for gas prices to mount a sustained recovery, other companies will have to follow Chesapeake’s lead. Producers are likely to remain under pressure from low gas prices, until more of them crack.Chesapeake stands a better chance than most companies of being able to curb US gas output and send prices higher. It is the second-largest producer in the US, accounting for 9 per cent of the country’s gas output and a much higher proportion of the growth over the past decade.Yet even its shift of about 50 rigs away from gas drilling is not enough to cut activity to the point where US gas production begins to fall, according to Mary Barcella of IHS, a consultancy.According to Baker Hughes, the oil and gas services company, there were 780 rigs drilling for gas in the US last week, down from 906 a year ago. Ms Barcella calculates that figure needs to drop below 700 before gas production will fall. Even then, she expects a lag of about five months, as wells that have been drilled and completed are brought on stream.Martin Craighead, Baker Hughes’ chief operating officer, said on Tuesday he expected the gas rig count to keep dropping “until there is a meaningful increase in gas prices”.A few other companies have talked about cutting their investment in gas production. Talisman Energy of Canada has announced a sharp cut in rigs drilling in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Halliburton, another services company, revealed that it was redeploying crews for hydraulic fracturing, used to open up difficult reserves, away from gas production and into oil.The problem for the industry is that every company would prefer that someone else cuts back production.Jeb Armstrong, an analyst at CLSA, describes it as the “classic prisoner’s dilemma”, in which individually rational behaviour has a collectively damaging outcome.”Everyone in the industry knows they need to choke back on production to boost prices, but I don’t think any of the others will follow Chesapeake’s lead and do so,” he says.Other reasonable-sized gas producers such as EOG Resources and Anadarko Petroleum will be reluctant to cut production, he argues.Fadel Gheit, oil and gas analyst at Oppenheimer, believes that eventually they will be forced to respond.“There is no compelling reason for companies to keep drilling themselves into bankruptcy …I would expect all large gas producers without exception to scale back production this year.”For many companies, including Chesapeake, a shift to producing oil and natural gas liquids, which earn much higher prices than “dry” gas, will sustain their finances, enabling them to keep on drilling.Liquids production also often produces gas as a byproduct, which will stop supply falling.So while the correction may be inevitable eventually – gas prices are now below the cost of production in parts of the US – timing it will not be easy.Ms Barcella of IHS believes prices are likely to remain around $3 per million British thermal units for the rest of the year; not much higher than today’s level of about $2.50 and a level that will be painful for many producers.“We are in uncharted territory,” she says, “and just feeling our way through it”."

The Nasdaq Composite index also fell 0.1 per cent to 2,784.17.Bank stocks continued to rally strongly, with Bank of America up 2.6 per cent to $7.25, while Citigroup climbed 0.7 per cent to $29.85.Oil and gas field services company Halliburton fell 2.1 per cent to $35.44, despite topping analyst estimates with fourth-quarter earnings of a dollar a share.The company’s North American margins declined more than 200 basis points to 27.2 per cent in the fourth quarter and could fall a further 100bp in the current quarter.“There was already a sense that the company was facing cost inflation issues at certain “fracking” sites, where there is high demand for equipment, but the extent that impacted on margins took people by surprise,” said Stephen Gengaro, an oil services analyst at Sterne Agee.Shares in Halliburton’s rival Baker Hughes fell 3.2 per cent to $47.73.Netflix dipped back below $100, falling 6.3 per cent to $93.96 for the worst performance in the S&P 500. Wedbush Securities analysts said the video streaming and DVD delivery company would probably forecast first-quarter earnings “well below” consensus estimates. The stock remains up almost 40 per cent for the year.BlackBerry manufacturer Research In Motion fell 8.5 per cent to $15.89 as the company’s joint chairmen and chief executives stepped aside, but new management dismissed suggestions the company would be sold.Sears Holdings shareholders endured another rollercoaster day. Shares climbed as high as $54.76, a gain of more than 10 per cent, on weekend reports that a key retail sector financing company, which had stopped providing credit to Sears suppliers, had begun to extend credit to the department store’s clients again.But the stock closed down 3.3 per cent at $47.39, as Credit Suisse analysts said the rally, which had seen the company’s market capitalisation increase by as much as two-thirds this year, was “a classic short squeeze,” rather than a result of improved sentiment toward the company.The Sears share price plunged in the last two months of 2011 after the retailer announced store closures after poor sales.Apple climbed 1.7 per cent amid heavy trading ahead of fourth-quarter results on Tuesday.Birinyi Associates told clients traders usually react positively to Apple’s reports with the stock tending to record strong gains in after-hours trading but, at $427.41, shares were already just short of an all-time high touched last week.

Juniper Networks advanced 6.1 per cent $23.88, while Cisco Systems was one of the best performers in the Dow Jones index, putting on 1.3 per cent to $19.79 ahead of results.Semiconductor manufacturer NetApp was up 8.3 per cent to $37.51 on reports it could be a subject of takeover bids.Cloud business software developer Salesforce.com rallied 6.3 per cent to $114.51 as Canaccord Genuity analysts said the company’s recent weakness on new billings, could prove temporary, “and not necessarily indicative of [the] firm’s outlook”.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.7 per cent to 2,788.33, but Google, the second most heavily weighted stock in the index, plunged 10 per cent to $581.35 in after-hours trading, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations by a large margin.The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced just 0.4 per cent to 12,623.98. The S&P 500 finished 0.5 per cent higher at 1,314.50, a gain of 4.5 per cent for the year.The benchmark index is set for its best January since 1997, but analysts warned a disappointing start to the earnings season could weigh on the index. Of the 59 S&P 500 companies that had reported by Thursday afternoon, only 49 per cent had beat expectations, the lowest level in 10 years, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.“Investors are now faced with losing the catalyst that strong earnings growth typically provides during reporting season,” said Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.Bank stocks continued to rally, as Morgan Stanley and Bank of America beat analyst expectations with fourth-quarter results, but materials, the other star sector of this year’s rally, sold off as profit fell at copper miner Freeport-McMoRan and Newmont Mining lowered its 2012 copper production forecast.BofA eked out a fourth-quarter profit on strong loan growth, although a lossmaking quarter for its investment banking unit weighed on performance, continuing the trend set by JPMorgan and Citigroup.Morgan Stanley declared a loss, but one that was much smaller than expected by analysts, as the investment bank bucked the trend to report an increase in trading revenue.BofA closed up 2.4 per cent to $6.96, after breaching $7 for the first time since the end of October in the morning session. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.4 per cent to $18.28. Other big bank stocks also rallied, except for Wells Fargo, which slipped 0.3 per cent to $30.15.Regional bank Huntington Bancshares fell 4 per cent to $5.79 as its average return on assets fell slightly despite a surge in lending, as the low interest rate environment appeared to take a toll.Freeport-McMoRan opened 2.5 per cent lower, before paring losses to end the day off just 0.2 per cent to $44.37. Fourth-quarter profit of $640m was less than half the figure for the same period in 2010. But many analysts had predicted worse results, after labour disputes hit production at its Indonesian mines in the fourth quarter. Newmont Mining fell 1.2 per cent to $59.60, after raising its forecast for gold output, but lowering guidance on copper extraction.Gas-focused energy exploration and production companies continued their torrid 2012, after natural gas futures, which have been plummeting for some time, hit a decade low.Cabot Oil & Gas fell 6.5 per cent to $63.09 and Range Resources fell 4.1 per cent to $54.06. Cabot is now off almost 17 per cent year to date.Ebay climbed 3.9 per cent to $31.51, as the company beat fourth-quarter estimates, thanks mainly to heavy usage of its PayPal electronic payments site. But some analysts focused on the less than stellar performance at Ebay’s core internet auction website business.“We continue to question the sustainability of the recent mid-teens core general merchandise volume growth rates heading to 2012,” said Brian Nowak at Nomura.Car parts manufacturer Johnson Controls slumped 8.4 per cent to $32.60 for the worst performance in the S&P 500 as the company lowered full-year earnings guidance, citing weakness in demand from Europe.But the aircraft part supplier Rockwell Collins climbed 5.5 per cent to $59.96 after the company said it was doubling production of parts for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner this quarter.First Solar slumped 10 per cent to $38.70, on reports the German government will cut subsidies for solar energy. The solar industry remains heavily dependent on support from eurozone governments for demand.Eastman Kodak, the company that invented the handheld camera, ended a prolonged share price slide by filing for bankruptcy.

But the index closed at 1,293.66, a gain of just 0.4 per cent, as financials, which had trended positive in the morning session, finished the day as the only sector in the red.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.5 per cent to 12,482.22, while the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,728.08.Earlier, contrasting results from Citigroup and Wells Fargo had emphasised the diverging fortunes of investment banking franchises and more conventional mortgage lenders.Citigroup ended the day off 8.2 per cent to $28.22, giving up half its gains for the year, as its investment banking arm reported a fourth-quarter loss, and overall net income of $1.2bn came in significantly below analyst expectations.Wells Fargo climbed 0.7 per cent to $29.83, as the largest US home lender reported record fourth-quarter earnings. Deposits at Wells rose 13 per cent during the quarter and residential mortgage lending increased more than a third to $120bn.For much of the day investors had appeared ready to wait for other banks to report their own results, rather than taking flight from the sector as a whole. Bank of America had enjoyed the best opening in the Dow Jones index, while Goldman Sachs was also in the black at midday.But BofA ended the day off 2 per cent to $6.48, Goldman was down 1.3 per cent to $97.68, Morgan Stanley fell 2.3 per cent to $16.25 and JPMorgan Chase, which had disappointed analysts with its own fourth-quarter results on Friday, closed down 2.8 per cent to $34.91.Despite the late sell-off, analysts were optimistic that bank stocks could avoid the large, correlated falls that characterised the second half of 2011.“I think investors are willing to put Q4 bank results behind them, and I think we remain on a general trend of financial stocks outperforming as long as sentiment towards the US economy improves,” said Richard Staite at Atlantic Equities.The day had started positively as US investors focused on positive data from better than expected Chinese gross domestic product and German investor sentiment numbers to offset Standard & Poor’s downgrade of eurozone sovereigns and the eurozone bail-out fund over the long American weekend.“Investors appear ever more convinced that central banks will do what it takes to ensure recovery regardless of downgrades,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial, “but technical analysts will point to low volume and the limited breadth of this equity rally. Volume is oxygen for bulls, and we’re not seeing that yet.”Elsewhere, shares in Sears Holdings surged 9.5 per cent to $36.75 as an analyst suggested Edward Lampert, Sears’ chairman and a big shareholder, may take the troubled department store chain private, buying out other shareholders.Sears’ market capitalisation has halved since the start of November, as the company announced store closures in December. Mr Lampert increased his personal stake in the company last week.Carnival Corporation plunged 13.7 per cent to $29.60 as investors traded shares in the cruise ship operator for the first time since one of its liners ran aground off the coast of Italy on the weekend.Carnival has estimated the initial financial impact of the disaster at $95m.RR Donnelley slumped 15.8 per cent to $12.13 for the worst performance in the S&P 500, as the corporate digital communications provider lowered its full-year 2011 revenue forecast to $10.6bn from as much as $10.8bn in November.Amazon investors brushed off a cybersecurity breach at its wholly owned subsidiary, the online shoe-seller Zappos, as shares closed up 1.8 per cent at $181.66.Saudi Arabia’s decision to target a crude oil price of $100 a barrel, a third higher than its previous publicly stated target, helped US energy companies with proved oil reserves.Denbury Resources climbed 4.4 per cent to $17.82, while ExxonMobil was up 1 per cent to $85.69 and Chevron climbed 0.6 per cent to $106.72. But gas explorers continued to suffer, with Cabot Oil & Gas down 1.2 per cent to $66.36, as US natural gas prices hit new multiyear lows on Monday.Newmont Mining fell 3.9 per cent to $60.94 after the company said copper output would be lower and capital expenditure higher in 2012 compared to 2011.Shares in Boeing climbed 0.9 per cent to $75.24, as European rival Airbus said total aircraft orders will probably drop by more than 50 per cent this year to as few as 600 from an all-time high of 1,419 in 2011.Illinois Tool Works climbed 3.2 per cent to $50.96, after the company said over the weekend it would allow Relational Investors, an activist investment firm, to appoint a board member.

But large commercial lending banks, which have rallied strongly this year, retreated somewhat with Bank of America off 2.7 per cent to $6.61 and Citigroup down 2.7 per cent to $30.74.Despite Friday’s losses, bank stocks had a strong week overall. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs both advanced more than 4.5 per cent, while Citi and BofA both hit two-month highs during the week.The S&P 500 came within touching distance of 1,300 for the first time since the end of July, as it reached five-month highs on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

ExxonMobil shares slipped 0.3 per cent to $84.88 over the week.The Nasdaq Composite index fared better, climbing 1.4 per cent to 2,710.67, as China’s plans to double solar energy capacity in 2012 boosted stocks. SunPower Corp ended the week up 13.2 per cent to $7.55.Tiffany fell 10.1 per cent to $59.10 over the week as the luxury department store cut earnings guidance after reporting anaemic holiday same-store sales growth in the US and a decline in sales at its flagship New York store.Asia-Pacific same-store sales rose 12 per cent year on year, but investor reaction suggested emerging market growth may not inoculate luxury brands like Tiffany and Coach against developed market worries.“No matter how good the performance in Asia, mature markets still matter,” said David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We’re starting to see weakness in financial markets impacting on high-end consumer spending.”Coach shares slipped 1 per cent to $62.02 over the week.Urban Outfitters ended the week off 9.2 per cent to $25.13, after investors responded to the unexpected resignation of Glen Senk as chief executive, by sending shares down 19 per cent in just one day.Erika Maschmeyer at RW Baird downgraded the stock to a “hold” equivalent from a “buy” equivalent, while Paul Lejuez at Nomura worried for the retailer’s turnround prospects, telling clients: “If Glen can’t do it, we wonder who can.”Gas-focused energy exploration and production companies suffered as the US natural gas price hit multiyear lows, falling more than 5 per cent on Wednesday, and again on Thursday.Cabot Oil & Gas retreated 16.7 per cent to $67.13 and Range Resources was off

Its shares slipped 2.5 per cent to $105.25.Tesorolast week attributed falling margins at Californian refineries to the narrowing spread between WTI and Brent crude but Chevron blamed a wider fall in demand for petrol and overstocked supplies.“The rise in the price of crude has been a result of fear about supply from Iran and Nigeria rather than increased demand,” said Fadel Gheit, oil and gas analyst at Oppenheimer. “That means petrol price rises have not kept up with crude price rises, and refiners are taking the hit.”ExxonMobil fell as much as 1.7 per cent but recovered to end the day down 0.4 per cent to $84.74. The two large energy stocks had weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, though the blue-chip index recovered to end the day up 0.2 per cent to 12,471.02.Elsewhere, US stocks inched up, with the S&P 500 closing 0.2 per cent higher at 1,295.5, now up 2.8 per cent for the year, and off to its best start since 2006. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.5 per cent to 2,724.7.December US retail sales disappointed, coming in just 0.1 per cent higher, or 0.2 per cent lower once car sales are stripped out. That halted a run of better than expected US economic data.“Although we’re bullish on equities for the year, we think the S&P 500 will have to take a leg down first as the realisation dawns that talk of the US decoupling from Europe and Asia is simply untrue,” said James Dailey, chief investment officer at Team Financial Managers.But energy stocks were the worst performers in the S&P 500 as the price of natural gas fell to a multiyear low of $2.72 per mbtu. That pushed explorers down with Cabot Oil & Gas off 3.6 per cent to $67.15, though the group said it was earning as much as $4 per mbtu of gas from production in the Marcellus Shale.Oil and gas field services companies were hurt, with Baker Hughes falling 3.8 per cent to $48.29.Dick’s Sporting Goods rose 11.1 per cent to $40.43 as the company said it would buy back $200m of its shares and maintained full-year guidance in an earnings update.David Strasser, a retail analyst at Janney, maintained his “buy” rating on Dick’s, telling clients the company had weathered its seasonally toughest quarter of the year.Bank of America topped $7 for the first time since October in the morning session, before slipping back to $6.79, a fall of 1.2 per cent. Citigroup was up 1 per cent to $31.60 and JPMorgan climbed 0.5 per cent to $36.85 ahead of earnings on Friday.Investment banks were subdued except for Jefferies, which broke above $15 for the first time since September, before closing 6 per cent up at $15.42. Questions about Jefferies’ exposure to eurozone sovereign debt had pushed its shares below $10 towards the end of 2011.Morgan Stanley climbed 0.4 per cent to $17.17 as Credit Suisse analysts estimated the market value of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney brokerage – which is 51 per cent owned by Morgan Stanley – at $15bn, a 30 per cent discount to the market value when the joint venture was launched.Morgan Stanley has the right to purchase another 14 per cent of the company in May, which Howard Chen at Credit Suisse said would “ultimately” make “strategic sense” despite Morgan Stanley Smith Barney’s valuation fall.Separately, Moshe Orenbuch at Credit Suisse tipped commercial banks to outperform investment banks when fourth-quarter earnings are unveiled. “While we expect a more revenue challenged quarter from the capital markets sensitive names, we think the large commercial banks will post respectable fourth-quarter results, particularly given improved loan growth trends in the quarter.”Regions Financial slipped 2.3 per cent to $4.69 as the bank confirmed the sale of its brokerage unit, Morgan Keegan, to Raymond James. Shares in Region had climbed more than 10 per cent this week on reports the sale could be worth more than $1bn.Raymond James eventually agreed to pay $930m, although Morgan Keegan will pay a one-off dividend of $250m to Regions before the sale completes.New Jersey lender Hudson City Bancorp fell 1.9 per cent to $7.12 as Brian Foran at Nomura said the bank’s lending margin could fall by another 60 basis points as existing loans are repaid and new funds are extended at lower prevailing interest rates.Wynn Resorts fell 1.9 per cent to $109.80 on reports that Kazuo Okada, the casino operator’s vice-chairman, had sued the company for access to financial records in a dispute over the use of funds.Shares in Sears Holdings climbed 3.3 per cent to $34.00 on a volatile day of trading.

That was a big swing from mark-to-market gains of $4.7m on Rialto investments in the fourth quarter of 2010.

The stock was a darling of internet investors in 2009 and 2010 as it saw rapid customer growth but Mark Moerdler at Sanford Bernstein said the company may be unable to prize more market share from smaller rivals. “Looking forward, we believe it will become more difficult for Salesforce.com to grow,” Mr Moerdler wrote to clients.Netflix shares surged 11.4 per cent to $80.45, after the company said users had streamed 2bn hours of video from its website in the fourth quarter.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the year up 5.5 per cent to 12,217.56, although a few big stocks skew the price-weighted index. Only the Nasdaq Composite index fell over the year, 1.8 per cent to 2,605.15.The worst performing stocks tell the macro stories that preoccupied investors this year.First Solar, down 74 per cent for the year to $33.76, has seen a lucrative market for solar panels disrupted first by a glut of supply from China and second by a threatened collapse in demand from the eurozone, as governments cut back on subsidies.Computer Sciences Corp, the IT services company that fell 52.2 per cent to $23.70, has been hit by reduced government spending on outsourcing, most recently the cancellation of a contract by the UK’s National Health Service.Alpha Natural Resources, down 66 per cent to to $20.43, and US Steel Corp, off 54.7 per cent to $26.46, have been two of the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500, moving 2 per cent for every percentage point move in the benchmark index.Their share prices have waxed and waned with sentiment about Chinese growth and demand for steel, which US Steel Corp makes and Alpha’s metallurgical coal is needed to manufacture, from the country’s construction industry.Homebuilder stocks rallied on resilient US economic data. Lennar Corp and DR Horton, which had seen their market capitalisations more than halve by October, ended the year up 4.9 per cent to $19.66 and 5.7 per cent to $12.61 respectively, as US construction starts and pending home sales data turned positive in November.Among the big fallers only Netflix, down 60.5 per cent to $69.29 from a peak above $200, seemed little affected by macro events. The web-streaming company, the darling of internet investors in 2010, was undone by a decision to raise prices for users who wanted to continue using its physical DVD delivery service, and an aborted attempt to spin off the DVD business altogether.Moving from individual stocks to sectors, one theme dominated the year: the collapse of financials. Down 18.4 per cent for the year, 7 percentage points more than any other sector, their weighting in the S&P 500 has slipped to just 13 per cent, barely above consumer staples, energy or healthcare stocks.The four companies which have weighed most heavily on the index – Bank of America, down 58.3 per cent to $5.56, Citigroup, 44.4 per cent to $26.31, Goldman Sachs, 46.2 per cent to $90.43 and JPMorgan Chase, 21.6 per cent to $33.25 – were all banks. Between them they wiped more than 23 points off the S&P 500, equivalent to 2 per cent of the index at the start of the year.“Looking ahead banks are not necessarily key to a rally in US equities,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers investment research, “but they could certainly be the cause of a bear market, if they were to fall fast again.”At the other end of the spectrum investors cheered the boom in shale oil, and the prospects it offers for US energy independence.Cabot Oil & Gas saw its market capitalisation double as its share closed the year at $75.90, as the company increased revenues from oil by 50 per cent in the quarter ended September 30, compared with the same period in 2010.But it was solid performances by mega-caps which had the most market impact. Apple drove the S&P 500 significantly more than any other stock, giving the index an eight point boost, as its share price climbed 25.6 per cent over the year to $405.00. ExxonMobil’s 15.9 per cent move to $84.76 gave the S&P 500 another six points, while IBM boosted the index five points, as it rose 25.3 per cent to $183.88.

Analysts were unimpressed by a new strategy to sell completed solar farms to electricity utilities, rather than sell individual panels.“The new strategy does not look much different from the old one,” said Theodore O’Neill, renewables analyst at Wunderlich Securities. “First Solar has no competitive advantage in building for utilities, it has no choice but to cut the cost of panels.” First Solar ended the week off 30.1 per cent to $31.91, a price not seen since 2007.Yingli Green Energy fell 19.1 per cent to $3.60, SunPower Corp was down 22.7 per cent to $5.13 and MEMC Electronics Materials, which manufactures wafers for use in solar panels, fell 13.3 per cent to $3.83.Elsewhere the week started with a sharp sell-off as investors reassessed last Friday’s eurozone deal, and markets headed further south on Tuesday as the Federal Open Market Committee left monetary policy unchanged.Analysts said investment decisions were increasingly dependent on political events.“No one wants to be short going in to major summits or policy meetings in case they come up with a game-changing announcement,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors. “Once they pass investors are more willing to exit.”The S&P 500 closed the week down 2.8 per cent to 1,219.65, now off more than 2 per cent in December, historically a strong month for the benchmark index.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 2.6 per cent to 11,866.24, but at least remained in positive territory for the year.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 3.5 per cent to 2,555.33, as Apple, by far the most heavily weighted stock in the index, fell 3.2 per cent to $381.02.The iPad manufacturer was knocked by Intel’s plans to expand into hard disk drive-free ultrabooks, which could claim market share from Apple’s MacBook Air, and reduce demand for tablets.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 3.8 per cent over the week, led down by investment banks. Goldman Sachs fell 11.2 per cent to $90.10, a bad week made worse when Fitch Ratings downgraded its debt on Friday, along with bonds of Bank of America and Citigroup. Banks with large deposit taking retail franchises fared better, with JPMorgan Chase down just 3.9 per cent to $31.89 and Wells Fargo off only 3.5 per cent to $25.98.Energy stocks sold off heavily as the price of crude oil fell sharply.Independent oil explorers were hit hardest, with Range Resources falling 11.6 per cent to $60.20 and Cabot Oil and Gas down 8.6 per cent to $74.17.“The independents are the most exposed to changes in the oil price because unlike the integrated oil companies and majors, they don’t have any diversification into refining activities,” said Amir Arif at Stifel Nicolaus.Evidence of a shift to online sales boosted delivery firms, but led to fears of margin compression at physical retailers.Shares in FedEx climbed 2 per cent to $84.89 after the package delivery service reported earnings for the three months ended November 30 that were 76 per cent higher than last year.“It’s good news for the domestic economy, and especially good news for anyone tied to eCommerce,” said Donald Broughton at Avondale Partners.Shares in Best Buy fell 17.5 per cent to $23.19 after the electronics retailer missed earnings expectations, as it absorbed the cost of free shipping to online shoppers.In the three months to November 26, gross margin declined 76 basis points to 24.3 per cent.“This lower gross margin, we believe, will be a trend in both consumer electronics and across retail as the cost of sales increases, as the internet, a lower margin sales channel, continues to hurt margins,” said David Strasser, retail analyst at Janney.Research In Motion slumped 18.3 per cent to $13.44, with most of the damage done on Friday, after the BlackBerry handset maker said its new range of smartphones will not be available until the “latter part” of 2012.Zynga pulled off the biggest internet IPO since Google in 2004, raising $1bn by issuing 100m shares, which valued the company at $7bn overall. The shares “popped” 10 per cent in early trading after its debut on Friday, before paring gains and closing down 5 per cent to $9.50.The shares “popped” 10 per cent in early trading after its debut on Friday, before paring gains and closing down 5 per cent to $9.50.Fashion group Michael Kors debuted in the largest ever US fashion IPO raising before the shares surged another 20.5 per cent to $24.10 on Thursday and Friday.Shares in Cablevision slumped 8.5 per cent to $12.75 on Friday after chief operating officer Tom Rutledge unexpectedly said he would quit the cable company without offering a reason.Mr Rutledge had led the cable company since 2004, divesting assets such as Madison Square Garden and AMC Networks and focusing on cable infrastructure.

Its shares climbed 4.1 per cent to $47.99.First Solar’s market capitalisation has fallen by more than 60 per cent in the year to date and analyst response was muted.“This is a temporary positive because it will free up cash for other projects but doesn’t do anything to address the ongoing pricing pressure which puts never ending pressure on margins,” said Theo O’Neill at Wunderlich Securities.Rural wireless provider Frontier Communications fell 6.9 per cent to $5.36. Investors who bought the stock from Wednesday onwards are not entitled to a 19 cents dividend.Netflix climbed 5.6 per cent to $71.96 after it launched a service that will allow customers in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico to stream content through Microsoft’s Xbox 360.The company also received a boost from legislation passed by the US House of Representatives that will make it easier for users of social networks to share movies.Defence contractor SAIC had the second-biggest advance in the S&P 500, climbing 6.6 per cent to $12.95, as third-quarter sales beat analyst estimates.Investors had been braced for bad news because of the company’s dependence on constrained government spending, but the company was also boosted by news that it will be a lead contractor for a government project to build a system to scan emails and text messages.New-to-market technology stocks had a good day with Groupon climbing above its $20 IPO price for the first time in a week.

They come, in my opinion, from the underlying concern over a second financial crisis,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx.Energy stocks were among the laggards of the S&P 500, rising only 0.3 per cent, as oil-linked stocks were hit hard.“In the last few days refiners have seen a substantial narrowing in their product margin, as the spot price of finished petroleum and diesel products has fallen,” said Paul Cheng at Barclays Capital.Mr Cheng also said the narrowing premium in the price of Brent over WTI oil is hurting US refiners. A few Midwestern refiners buy WTI oil, which has been trading at a discount to Brent crude for the past year. As the discount narrows, those refiners face higher input costs.Tesoro Corporation, a big refiner, was down 1.3 per cent at $23.47. Marathon Petroleum was also off 3.6 per cent at $35.34. Other analysts said the sell-off in energy stocks was a reaction to fears about global growth, stemming from Europe. Oil explorers and producers were down too, even though the oil price rose Tuesday, with Denbury Resources falling 1.8 per cent to $13.96.Industrials outperformed on Tuesday, up 1.9 per cent as a sector in the S&P 500.Logistics and distribution groups Fastenal, up 4.7 per cent at $34.35, and WW Grainger, up 3.7 per cent at 157.27, had strong days. WW Grainger had announced 10 per cent rise in quarterly sales on Monday.Southwest Airlines, the budget airline, rose 4.4 per cent to $8.31.That left the S&P 500 higher on two days running for the first time this month. But investors were cautious. “Expect the index to keep trading in bands with 1,250 an absolute maximum, unless the situation in Europe is resolved,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Coca Cola Enterprises, the European arm of the soft drinks giant, was up 3.7 per cent at $26.46, as investors reacted favourably to an analyst day in Paris on Tuesday. UBS analyst Kaumil Gajrawala upgraded the stock to buy, but acknowledged the company faced challenges, in particular from falling demand in Europe and rising input costs due to surging commodity prices.Coke’s “valuation [is] now interesting”, Nomura analyst Ian Shackleton told clients. But he maintained a “hold” rating, telling clients: “We see the stock still being held back by macro issues for now.” Credit Suisse said the company is set to benefit from a “step-change” in UK sales due to advertising for the London Olympics next year.Micron Technology, up 2.6 per cent at $6.86, registered its sixth successive day of gains. Tristan Gerra, semiconductor analyst at RW Baird, said the semiconductor group’s strong performance was due to signs that the spot price for DRam computer memory, Micron’s main product, may have bottomed.

Investors are looking for the overall stock market to break the pattern of lower highs and lower lows.”Pfizer led the Dow and was a bellwether for healthcare stocks, which continued their recent rally to rise 1.2 per cent, just behind technology shares. The giant drugmaker was up 2.5 per cent at $21.45 after it settled a patent disagreement with Teva, the generics maker, over the Neurontin epilepsy drug for an undisclosed amount.General Dynamics, the defence group, led the S&P 500 by rising 4.2 per cent to $74.22.It was awarded a $774m US Navy contract to build a new refuelling ship at its Nassco shipyards in San Diego on Monday and was upgraded by veteran sector analysts at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to “buy”.Shares of Big Lots rose 3.1 per cent to $33.41, a standout among retailers.

The company also lowered its revenue guidance for the current year by $2bn. The stock slumped 10.1 per cent to $43.36.The earnings news weighed on the sector. EMC, the world’s largest data-storage company by revenue, was down 1.2 per cent to $26.27 and the S&P technology index lost 1.6 per cent.That helped drag the S&P 500 down 0.9 per cent to 1,303.46 by mid-session on Wall Street.In the previous session the index lost 2.1 per cent on the geopolitical tensions and escalating violence in Libya, the sharpest one-day fall on the index in six months. The second consecutive day of losses has prompted commentators to ask whether this is the beginning of the widely prophesised pull-back in the US markets.“This situation has some similarities with the eurozone crisis nearly a year ago which led to a temporary correction in the markets,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. “But upwards momentum in the economy looks a lot stronger now than a year ago,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.8 per cent lower at 12,118.45 and the Nasdaq was down 1.7 per cent to 2,710.82. The S&P 500 is still up 2.6 per cent this year. Energy stocks saw some of the few gains in the session as oil prices surpassed $110 a barrel for the first time since before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Industry executives’ estimated that at least half of Libya’s oil production has been shut down due to the violence.Marathon Oil, a leading US oil and gas company, was up 4.2 per cent to $49.69 while Chevron added 3.3 per cent to $103.58. The S&P energy index rose 2.2 per cent to a 2½-year high.Elsewhere in the sector Cabot Oil & Gas was up 12 per cent to $44.59 after the natural gas producer reported strong fourth-quarter results. Range Resources, the oil and gas exploration and production company, rose 8.6 per cent to $52.82.Sentiment in the energy sector was also aided by more deal activity. Enterprise Products Partners, an oil and gas energy partnership, made an offer to acquire Duncan Energy Partners for about $2.41bn.Duncan Energy was up 24.1 per cent to $40.40 on the news while Enterprise Products was down 0.6 per cent to $43.42.This week, Holly and Frontier Oil announced a merger that will create a $7bn oil refining company while BHP Billiton agreed to buy Chesapeake Energy’s shale gas business for $4.7bn.The global energy and power sector has seen the strongest start to the year in terms of mergers and acquisitions activity on record, according Thompson Reuters data.The value of energy and power mergers and acquisitions now totals $93.7bn, a 40 per cent increase over this time last year. Half of this activity has been in the US.Looking at economic data, investors were given some small cause for celebration as data showed that the number of existing home sales rose unexpectedly in January. Home sales were up 2.7 per cent from the previous month, according to the National Association of Realtors, slightly ahead of estimates.But data in the previous session showed that house prices had continued to fall in December, limiting investor optimism about the troubled US housing market.Lowe’s saw losses after the home improvement retailer projected flat comparable store sales and slightly decreasing margins.The company also reported that fourth-quarter profits had jumped thanks to greater demand for house renovation projects, which helped to limit the losses on the stock. The shares were still down 2 per cent to $25.46, however.The results come the day after larger rival Home Depot reported strong quarterly results and raised its profit forecast for the year.Netflix continued to lose ground after news earlier this week that Amazon.com was launching a rival video streaming service.

29;COG;Cabot Oil & Gas Corp;2011-02-03T21:13:15Z;Rally in oil prices powers energy stocks to gains;The question now is how much fuel remains in the tank;The soaring price of crude oil has landed investors owning energy stocks with a dilemma.Since last August, the price of Brent, the North Sea benchmark, has risen 40 per cent to more than $100 a barrel. The S&P 500’s energy sector has, in turn, rallied 45 per cent.Among the 41 companies that comprise the S&P energy group, 35 are up more than 20 per cent. The best performer since August has been Massey Energy, with a gain of 95 per cent, while the laggard, EOG Resources, is still up 4.1 per cent.The question after such a stunning rally is how much fuel remains in the tank for further gains.“The big worry is that energy stocks can become a victim of their own success,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “If the price of oil goes too high, too fast, it can hurt the economy.”That was certainly the case in 2008, when oil prices topped out at $147 a barrel in July, before the world economy was hit by the financial crisis and slid into recession.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, admits he is torn over the energy sector. The firm cut recently its holding to “market weight” from “overweight”.“Energy stocks have done so well in such a short period of time and we have made good money in the sector. Now I’m debating whether we should go to ‘underweight’, but part of me is not so sure,” he says.There is certainly a case to be made that energy stocks are due for a pullback of some sort, but much depends on whether oil prices keep rising.Based on price-to-sales comparisons versus the overall market, Mr Ablin estimates the energy sector is 19 per cent above its median for the past 15 years. That looks high, but in 2008 and 2009, the ratio was much higher.One reason for Mr Paulsen’s uncertainty over energy stocks is that in the past year the price of oil has fallen against that of other commodities, such as gold, copper and grains.“As [well] as oil stocks have done, the price of oil should be around $120 a barrel if it had kept pace with commodity prices in general,” he says.Other investors are betting that the oil price, while not as astronomical as some commodities, will remain elevated over the next few years and thus provide a fertile environment for energy stocks to keep increasing in value.“Oil service stocks, particularly, have been benefiting from steadily high prices, prompting major companies to bring on more projects and spend more on exploration around the world,” says Nick Koutsoftas, a portfolio manager at GE Asset Management.Schlumberger, the largest oil services group, is up 60 per cent since last August, while Halliburton has gained 66 per cent.Mr Koutsoftas says he thinks oil prices will remain above $85 a barrel over the next five years because, among other things, “new oil is coming from harder-to-reach places and so the marginal cost for producers is increasing”.Yet while the underlying price of oil plays a major role in the valuation of stocks in the sector, there are concerns over valuations, particularly for gas companies, which are trading at very high prices based on their expected earnings.“I do worry about some valuations for gas companies,” Michael Kay, oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research, says. Companies such as Pioneer Energy trade at a price-to-earnings multiple of 158 times, with Range Resources at 96 and Cabot Oil & Gas at 36 times.Gas groups such as these benefit from being growth companies, with successful exploration strikes transforming their bottom line.By comparison, ExxonMobil, the world’s most valuable company with a market capitalisation of $416bn, is already up 13 per cent this year and trades at 13.2 times prospective 2011 earnings.For some investors, staying in the energy sector is a bet that still looks good even if they would not come into the market for the first time now. “You have to enjoy the wave and, while it’s too expensive to enter now, we will hold energy stocks until they break down,” Mr Ablin says.

As a sector, oil and gas saw the most $1bn or larger deals in 2010, with 65 deals for $220bn globally, according to Dealogic.The market is expected to continue to expand, with some $90bn of oil and gas assets said to be for sale in 2011. Reliance Industries, the Indian energy conglomerate, said it is still seeking expansion in the US.Other independent US shale exploration groups were mixed. Cabot Oil & Gas was up 0.9 per cent, to $37.69, but Denbury Resources was down 1.4 per cent to $19.Energy shares overall were up fractionally at the end of the session, as US indices slipped back from their highest levels since September 2008 in extremely light end-of-year trading volumes.The S&P 500 index was down 0.2 per cent at 1,257.88. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 0.1 to 11,569.71, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was down 0.2 per cent to 2,662.98.Sentiment was softer in spite of a sharp decrease in weekly US jobless claims. Claims fell by 8 per cent, with 388,000 unemployment insurance claims filed for the week ending December 25. The figures were adjusted for the typical jump in holiday hiring.“We would advise taking the result reported today with a very large grain of salt. The holiday season normally creates volatility in these figures that doesn’t shake out until late January,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Monster Worldwide, the jobs listings service provider, saw shares rise 2.1 per cent to $24.12, at one point seeing their highest since June 2008.The Chicago region purchasing managers’ index also improved, rising from 62.5 in November to 68.6 for this month.

They also expected a swing to the Republicans in the midterm elections on Tuesday.But analysts at JPMorgan said that although the outcomes of the FOMC meeting and the US midterms should help support stocks in the near term, the longer-term sustainability of the equity rally will rely on growth.“It is encouraging that the third-quarter reporting season has delivered another positive surprise in earnings growth, for the seventh quarter in a row,” they said.“[But in 2011] companies will have to rely more on revenues to generate earnings surprises. And this is becoming already more difficult,” they added.The S&P 500 industrials index rose sharply after data showed US manufacturing rose to a five-month high and the Chinese purchasing managers’ index beat expectations.

35;COG;Cabot Oil & Gas Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
