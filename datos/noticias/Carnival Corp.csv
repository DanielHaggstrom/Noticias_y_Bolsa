0;CCL;Carnival Corp;2020-04-07T03:00:20Z;Why cruise ship-backed bonds drew $17bn of demand;Carnival’s example could be copied by other asset-heavy groups in dire straits;It was the deal that sounded like an April Fools’ joke: bond investors falling over themselves to give a cruise ship company a boat load of money.Carnival Corporation, the world’s largest cruise operator, received $17bn of orders from bond investors last week for $4bn of debt backed by its fleet of ships. Carnival printed the secured bonds as part of a wider $6.25bn rescue financing on April 1.Coronavirus has killed passengers on several of Carnival’s cruise ships — incidents that have put the term “floating Petri dishes” firmly in the popular lexicon. And yet the company and its bankers constructed an appealing investment case for bond fund managers, potentially setting a template that other asset-heavy companies in dire straits could follow.It is not hard to see why Carnival needed the cash: it is having to endure an unprecedented global shutdown of the cruise industry.Even after raising billions in the capital markets and drawing down a $3bn credit line with banks, the company warned that it might run out of money in eight months, as it leaks a monumental $1bn of cash a month.So why the strong demand for the bond sale? The first thing to make clear is that the $17bn order book number is essentially nonsense.When a big bond deal gains enough momentum, it attracts hedge funds looking to buy a piece of the offering using borrowed money, which then sell it on almost immediately for a quick profit. Such funds are called “new issue flippers”, in the disdainful terms of portfolio managers at more staid investment firms.But these longer-term investors are not blameless either. Many of them increase their orders beyond what they actually want, in the hope of getting as big a piece of the pie as possible.If you needed any evidence of the distorting effect this has on the true level of demand, Carnival’s bonds fell below their issue price the next afternoon. So much for the $13bn of extra money that did not find a home in the sale.But while the order book number was undeniably inflated, Carnival’s bond deal was certainly a success. One reason for that is pretty straightforward: the Panama-incorporated company paid up.Carnival still somehow carries an investment-grade credit rating and yet it had to offer investors an annual coupon of 11.5 per cent to borrow for just three years. As the bonds were sold at a slight discount, the yield investors make is closer to 12 per cent — a rate more normally associated with companies in the lowest reaches of the junk bond market.If that is not enough, investors could get back more than the money they invested. If Carnival wants to retire the bonds before 2023, the company has to pay a substantial premium to investors. Given that it is paying a massive annual interest bill of more than $450m on these new bonds, if the cruise ship industry returns to any semblance of normality within the next year, the chances of an early repayment seem high.But what if it all goes wrong?Carnival assuaged investors’ concerns by offering them a lot of collateral: the $4bn in bonds are secured on $28bn worth of ships and other assets such as intellectual property.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereThe value of these boats would be questionable if the cruise industry were to collapse entirely. But investors can still mark down their value severely and potentially get their money back, as bondholders share this collateral with less than $500m of other debt.Carnival had so much freedom to pledge its assets because its investment-grade rating meant it was previously able to borrow freely on an unsecured basis. The new bonds would rank ahead of $16bn of the company’s existing debt in a bankruptcy.This is not great for the company’s existing bondholders, which have just seen a new slice of debt layered ahead of them.Bonds are supposed to have safeguards against this happening — a phenomenon known as getting “primed” in debt markets parlance. But these restrictions often have big enough loopholes to steer one of Carnival’s cruise ships through, particularly in the borrower-friendly market for investment-grade bonds.Unsurprisingly, bond investors are now running the slide rule over the asset bases of other companies that have seen sharp drops in liquidity. Airlines are one obvious candidate, with European carriers such as easyJet and Ryanair still retaining investment-grade ratings.But now the taboo against paying up and pledging assets has been broken, you can expect that more companies will be willing to follow suit and “do a Carnival”.robert.smith@ft.com
1;CCL;Carnival Corp;2020-04-06T16:23:11Z;Saudi Arabia’s PIF takes 8.2% stake in cruise operator Carnival ;Rare sign of investor confidence in industry battered by coronavirus pandemic;Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund has built an 8.2 per cent stake in struggling cruise operator Carnival, marking the Gulf fund’s latest high-profile direct investment after previous bets on companies such as Tesla and Uber.The PIF’s position amounts to a $430m stake based on the US-traded company’s share price, which rose 23 per cent on Monday, but is still down by almost 80 per cent this year.The PIF, which is used by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to advance and diversify Saudi Arabia’s economic interests, revealed that it owned 43.5m shares in a regulatory filing signed by its head, Yasir al-Rumayyan, who is a close ally of the prince.The purchase marks a rare sign of investor confidence in an industry that has been battered by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed passengers and left cruise ships pleading with countries to be allowed to dock.All big cruise operators have suspended operations until at least May and share prices have tumbled in response to their struggles. Carnival has said it will burn through $1bn a month even with all its ships in dock, including payouts on customer deposits for cancelled bookings and future committed ship orders.Last week it raised a total of $6.25bn in debt and equity from investors as it raced to secure funds to meet its cash needs for the next several months. The fundraising included the sale of $500m of new shares at $8 each.Multiple people with knowledge of that deal confirmed that the PIF did not acquire its stake through the offering. That means the PIF bought the stake in the open market, with an unknown purchase price. It did not own any shares in Carnival before the start of 2020. Shares in Carnival have fallen from $51 in January to less than $8 last week before rebounding to $10.44 on Monday afternoon.The PIF has had a mixed record in direct investing, with a 2016 bet on ride-hailing group Uber still trading well below the $62.5bn valuation it bought in.The fund’s now exited position in Tesla was revealed by the Financial Times in August 2018 and prompted its founder Elon Musk to make his “funding secured” tweet, which ultimately led Mr Musk and Tesla to face regulatory penalties. A person close to the Saudi royal court said: “Any investor should look at global opportunities — the lessons learnt from 2008, buy undervalued assets.”This person added that the PIF would be active in dealmaking in the coming weeks. “You will see a lot of acquisitions in the next few weeks. This is a good opportunity . . . keeping in mind their main effort right now should be geared to the domestic [economy].”Carnival declined to comment.
2;CCL;Carnival Corp;2020-04-03T11:22:13Z;Some holidaymakers can’t wait for their next cruise ;Operators such as Carnival have been battered by coronavirus but passengers are surprisingly stoical;"The world is frozen by the coronavirus pandemic. People are locked down. Industry is shut down. The final toll on business is unknowable. Optimistic economists, who last week were predicting a sharp rebound in the third quarter, are starting to sober up. Without a big advance in testing or treatment, normality might not return for a year or more. Surely nothing can preserve companies in a state of suspended animation for that long.Against this grim backdrop, however, consider the admirable resilience of two groups: cruise passengers and bond investors, who both think we might soon be floating on the high seas sipping piña coladas. This week, Carnival Corporation pulled off an audacious refinancing, raising $6bn from investors. The cruise line’s chutzpah is impressive. Against stiff competition, Carnival’s shares are among the worst-performing globally this year among companies worth more than $1bn, having fallen 85 per cent. As Carnival acknowledged this week in the “recent developments” section of the bond offering’s prospectus, it has experienced a few problems of late.First, coronavirus struck its Diamond Princess ship, which was then quarantined in a Japanese port; “a substantial proportion” of passengers were infected and some died. “Numerous” passengers and crew on its Grand Princess ship were infected too and some of them died. The infection has also spread on other Carnival ships, including Zaandam, Costa Luminosa, Ruby Princess, Costa Magica and Costa Favolosa. Some of those passengers have died, too, and some of those disease-ridden ships were left at sea with ports refusing to accept them.There’s a huge appetite from our customers to get back out thereCarnival has stopped all operations across its remaining fleet. It is trying to encourage passengers whose trips have been cancelled to forgo a refund and take a voucher for a future cruise, with generous amounts of credit for onboard entertainment. If enough passengers demand cash then the drain on liquidity could hasten the company’s demise. It is already at $1bn a month.To buttress its finances, Carnival had to offer debt investors an annual coupon of 11.5 per cent. But it is remarkable that it raised the money at all after the horrific experiences of so many passengers. As rival Norwegian Cruise Line noted drily last month, “coronavirus is also impacting consumer sentiment regarding cruise travel generally”.Nevertheless, bond investors are somehow betting that impact will be temporary and that cruise lovers will put the horror out of their minds. They might be right.During a trading update on Thursday, Saga, a UK-listed company that offers cruises targeted at the over-fifties on its two ships, Spirit of Discovery and Spirit of Adventure, highlighted the stoicism of its customers. Saga’s ships were 86 per cent full in March, better than normal, even as the pandemic engulfed more countries.“They were very keen to continue cruising right until the government effectively locked the sector down,” said chief executive Euan Sutherland. “Almost 60 per cent of them immediately rebooked cruises with us, so they didn’t ask for their money back, even with a period of uncertainty. They said, ‘right, when can I book again?’”Even for cruises scheduled for this autumn and early next year, Saga’s cabins are 80 per cent full. As Mr Sutherland said: “There’s a huge appetite from our customers to get back out there.”"

On Wednesday, Carnival Corporation raised more than $6bn, most of it in high-yield senior debt. That is meant to tide the cruise holiday company over. Lockdowns have curtailed summer holiday bookings and cruise liners now have a grim reputation for becoming quarantine ships. The centrepiece of the financing is a $4bn offering of five-year senior secured bonds priced at just under par with an annual coupon of 11.5 per cent. That juicy implied return attracted enough investors for Carnival to increase the offering from a mooted $3bn.Carnival’s physical assets — its fleet — are valued on its balance sheet at nearly $40bn. There should be more than enough collateral to cover the bonds. And even if, in a year’s time, these senior bonds fall a tenth in value, 12 months worth of coupons will allow buyers to break even on their investment.Carnival business has ceased to exist in the short term. It looks questionable longer term. The lesson? At the right price, even the most troubled companies have lifelines available.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereStill, Carnival had advantages. Because it had been an investment grade company, its existing $12bn pile of loans and bonds did not have much in the way of covenants preventing it from adding senior debt. It had collateral, too. Many other troubled companies have already played those cards. Their chances of a cash infusion are far lower.Down in steerage, Carnival got a rougher reception. It sold $500m worth of common shares on Tuesday at an approximate 85 per cent discount to where the stock traded in mid-January. On Wednesday, Carnival’s market worth was about $6bn, with $20bn of debt above that common equity.Carnival also sold $1.75bn of convertible bonds at such a modest premium that Carnival’s shares had exceeded the exercise price just two days ago. Those bondholders are entitled to a remarkable 5.75 per cent annual coupon.With rescue financings floated on such needy terms, the mere hint of a turnround will be enough to turn them into lucrative trades.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
4;CCL;Carnival Corp;2020-04-01T14:48:08Z;Carnival increases size of rescue bond sale to $4bn;Orders for debt package at world’s biggest cruise operator smash $10bn;Carnival Corporation is increasing the size of a rescue bond sale backed by its cruise ships to $4bn after drawing strong demand, even as the world’s largest cruise operator warned it might only have enough cash to stay afloat for eight months.The Panama-incorporated company launched a $6bn fundraising package on Tuesday, tapping debt and equity investors for liquidity after coronavirus killed passengers on several of its cruise ships and had a severe impact on future bookings. Having initially sought to raise $3bn in three-year bonds secured on the majority of its ships, Carnival announced on Wednesday that it was raising this to $4bn. Two investors said that the deal had already received more than $10bn of orders. However the price Carnival is paying is steep. The group will offer investors an annual coupon of 11.5 per cent, equating to over $450m in interest costs a year, and will issue the bonds at a slight discount to face value. While the debt carries an investment-grade rating and will be backed by cruise vessels and other assets that Carnival says are worth more than $28bn, this interest rate is more normally associated with companies in the lowest reaches of the junk bond market.“This is a high investment-grade company that is now borrowing at usury rates,” said John McClain, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management. “Things have changed quickly. If you are borrowing at 12 per cent then you are fairly desperate.”The cruise ship operator has also set out plans to raise $1.75bn of bonds that can convert into shares and $1.25bn in newly issued stock, although two investors said on Wednesday that they expected Carnival to cut back the size of the equity offering to $750m. Carnival did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a memorandum to bond investors Carnival issued a series of stark warnings about its ability to withstand an unprecedented international shutdown of the cruise industry.“We have never previously experienced a complete cessation of our cruising operations, and as a consequence, our ability to be predictive regarding the impact of such a cessation on our brands and future prospects is uncertain,” the document said. The original $6bn funding plan would have given Carnival about $9.5bn of cash on its balance sheet, although the size of the overall deal might now be higher. However, the bond document says that this is only sufficient to fund its “liquidity requirements over the next eight months” — until the end of November — as the company needs about $1bn of cash a month.While investors have been drawn to the bond sale due to its collateral, which includes 86 of Carnival’s 105 cruise ships, the document warns that the market value of the fleet has been “adversely affected” by the shutdown in the cruise industry and that the market for used vessels is “small”.Carnival is turning to investors for funding as it is unclear whether it will be able to benefit from the $2tn US stimulus deal signed last week. Even though the group has its headquarters in Florida and pays US tax, it is incorporated in Panama, which may impede government support.Carnival said on Tuesday that although “on the surface” it appeared that the company would not be able to apply for it there were aspects of the package that “require further investigation”.Additional reporting by Alice Hancock and Arash Massoudi
5;CCL;Carnival Corp;2020-03-31T15:30:57Z;Carnival looks to raise $6bn to stay afloat;Largest operator has cancelled all cruises after passengers contracted Covid-19;"Carnival Corporation is looking to raise $6bn to stay afloat, paying a hefty premium to investors after coronavirus killed passengers on several of its cruise ships and severely hit future bookings.The world’s largest cruise operator said on Tuesday it intended to raise at least $3bn of three-year bonds secured on part of its fleet of cruise ships, $1.75bn of bonds that can convert into shares and $1.25bn in newly issued stock.Several investors said Carnival had indicated it might pay a coupon of above 12 per cent on the senior secured bonds, an incredibly high interest rate for a company that still has an investment-grade rating.Carnival’s US-listed shares have lost about three-quarters of their value this year, as it reels from the impact of coronavirus on its business.More than 3,700 passengers were quarantined for more than 20 days off the coast of Japan — some in windowless rooms — on the Carnival-owned Diamond Princess after the virus erupted on the ship. Six have subsequently died.Carnival is taking a big leap here. A lot of companies would not consider this deal. They are telling you they want financing above all else.”The World Health Organisation gives the 712 cases on the Carnival-owned Diamond Princess cruise liner their own row in its tally of the disease, which otherwise contains only countries. The number of cases is similar to those recorded in Hong Kong.Another of its ships, the Grand Princess, was stranded off California for five days while US authorities decided whether to allow the liner, which had 21 reported cases of the disease, to dock; two of those passengers have since died. Meanwhile another four passengers died aboard the Zaandam, a Carnival ship denied entry to multiple countries whose owner is now pleading to be allowed to dock in Florida.Carnival temporarily cancelled all cruises this month and reported a sharp decline in future bookings, even after the company slashed its prices. It said it had made a loss, including gains and losses on ship sales and restructuring costs, of $781m in the three months to the end of February compared with income of $336m in the same period last year.Shares in Carnival rose 10 per cent on news of the potential financing. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are leading it, with all three of the US banks also among a wider group of lenders backing a $3bn revolving-credit facility that Carnival drew down earlier this month.“Carnival is taking a big leap here,” said Christopher Yanney, co-founder of CKC Capital. “A lot of companies would not consider this deal. They are telling you they want financing above all else.”Carnival’s options may be limited by the fact it is incorporated in Panama, which might bar it from US government support even though it is headquartered in Florida and pays US tax. Carnival said that although “on the surface” it appeared that the company would not be able to apply for government support, there were aspects of the package that “require further investigation”.

Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereCarnival added that the pricing on the bond, which is due to close on Wednesday, had not yet been fixed.While the company paid an interest rate of just 1 per cent to raise a $600m 10-year bond in October, this debt is now trading at little over half its face value as investors have looked to cut exposure to the stricken cruise ship industry. The new senior secured bonds Carnival is offering to investors would rank ahead of these existing unsecured bonds in a bankruptcy.Additional reporting by Eric Platt and Arash Massoudi"
6;CCL;Carnival Corp;2020-03-24T15:18:47Z;Coronavirus/cruise lines: battening down;The industry has voluntarily suspended sailings for a month but that could be extended;Where extraordinary happens, boasts Royal Caribbean in its adverts. Cruise ships have proven extraordinary at one thing: spreading coronavirus. In Australia, infected passengers who recently disembarked from the Ruby Princess led to the largest jump in the country’s confirmed virus cases so far on Tuesday. In turn, this industry has its own financial ills to battle.Share prices in major cruise companies have crashed 80 per cent this year. The industry has voluntarily suspended sailings for a month but that could be extended. Cruise lines would run out of cash within three to five months of no sailing, analysts say. London-listed Carnival, the world’s biggest operator, had $20bn of revenues and nearly $3bn of after-tax earnings last year. It already forecasts a net loss this year.Creditors nervously monitor Carnival’s ability to meet its interest payments. Interest coverage is a key debt covenant. Its loan covenants require that ebitda covers its interest payments by more than three times. Tapping into its $2.8bn credit facility last week gave a hint of its growing desperation. With a three-month pause to cruising — entirely possible at this stage — Carnival would breach its covenant, say analysts at Morgan Stanley.Cruise lines, with their massive ships which can cost well over a billion dollars, are capital intensive. On current analyst estimates, Carnival has no free cash flow until 2022. Royal Caribbean too will feel the pinch given it has over $4bn of investment commitments this year. On Monday, it arranged and drew down a $2.2bn one-year credit facility. Despite the industry’s voluntary hiatus, most should expect the big ships to remain docked for longer. Reputational risk is paramount. Cruise operators do rely on passenger loyalty, but in fact new customers are the key to growth. Unfortunately, the industry’s big bet was on China’s tourists. No doubt, the coronavirus has forced that growth market off its moorings.Lex coronavirus advice exchange. We invite Lex readers to swap advice, queries and opinions.

7;CCL;Carnival Corp;2020-04-26T00:16:19+0000;Will cruise ships survive and what will be left of them?;It is no surprise that virus-hit Carnival is the FTSE’s worst performer this year;Carnival is an oddity. The London listing of the Miami-based cruise line operator is a legacy of its 2003 hostile takeover of P&O Princess Cruises, which it won on a pledge to be dual-listed.The stock also stands out as the FTSE 100’s biggest faller in the year to date, down more than 60 per cent. As of Friday morning the aggregate value of Carnival’s UK and US lines was £2.5bn ($3.2bn) lower than when the P&O takeover took effect almost 17 years ago, when the combined fleet was 62. It is now 104.Judging whether this sell-off is an overreaction demands answers to two key questions: how long it will take for coronavirus to be brought under control, and what will be left of the industry when that moment comes. Until that becomes clear there is no possibility of anchoring forecasts and calculating future values. Investing becomes gambling. And, as this week’s record-breaking falls show, most investors are reluctant gamblers.The viral outbreak has become an existential crisis for the industry. Carnival’s competitors have fared even worse so far this year, with Wall Street-listed Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean each down about 80 per cent.Cruises have been targeted because no sector looks as poorly positioned to cope. The disease has spread through the winter “wave season”, the industry’s key quarter when ship owners race for early bookings so they can at least break even for their year’s scheduled sailings. Demand and capacity are often hard to match as ships are typically delivered up to five years after ordering and have price tags with nine figures.Then there is the much-discussed problem of demographics. About one in seven cruise ship passengers is over 70, putting them in the highest risk category for Covid-19. After decades of stories about outbreaks of norovirus, the operators already had a poor reputation for keeping them healthy.A Covid-19 case on Carnival’s Diamond Princess is used by epidemiologists to benchmark incubation rates, having resulted in 700 infections and eight deaths. Carnival this week announced it would suspend for two months all sailings under its Princess brand, which accounts for about a fifth of its fleet and targets older holidaymakers wanting longer tours. While the action should protect the Princess brand from further damage, it may not help the long-term viability of its product.One certainty is that 2020 is a write-off. Booking cancellations were reported to be running at around 50 per cent even before Italy’s nationwide lockdown and the US’s ban on incoming European travel.Offers of big discounts on future bookings have allowed operators to keep hold of customers’ deposits, delaying any crunch on working capital. But increasingly generous terms and flexibility in the customers’ favour could be storing up cash flow problems for later. US president Donald Trump has talked in vague terms about state assistance but what that means in practice — if anything — is anyone’s guess.Even if cruise line operators are somehow treated as too big to fail, it is not obvious why they are candidates for bailouts. Carnival’s debt covenants, in common with its main peers, are framed mostly around balance sheet values. Eroding these buffers would take deep writedowns of equity value and significant losses over several years, which does not look very likely, as managements move into cash protection mode. There may well be failures among the smaller, weaker players. But that would make an already cartel-like industry even more concentrated.In 2016 Macquarie estimated a replacement cost for Carnival’s fleet of nearly $54bn, more than twice the company’s current shrunken enterprise value of just over $21bn. In any assumption other than an L-shaped recovery, the risks of failure are not yet that extreme.So can a valuation argument be built around those facts alone? Potentially — with the caveat that everyone to try so far has regretted it very soon after. The first quarter has been one that proves the dictum that no matter how bad things are, they can always get worse.For some, however, it looks like a gamble worth taking. James Hardiman, analyst at Wedbush Securities, says that while his targets for the stock “feel somewhat like an exercise in futility”, there is logic behind them.“If these companies do not go out of business, they will most likely double or triple in value over the course of the next 12-18 months,” he wrote in a report this week. “While speaking in these terms is understandably nauseating to some investors, others will eventually see this as a big moneymaking opportunity.”* This column was amended on 14 March to correct the prices of ships
8;CCL;Carnival Corp;2020-01-31T11:00:31Z;Coronavirus/cruise lines: the weaker vessels  ;The industry faces choppy waters that will continue beyond the current epidemic;The outbreak of the new coronavirus shows how heftily fear of the unknown outweighs mundane dangers. Consider the rout in US-listed shares of cruise lines. The stocks, notionally encapsulating all discounted future returns, are down 8-14 per cent. Chinese passengers occupy only 5 per cent or so of berths for Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line. The hit from cancelled voyages may be limited to a single sailing season.The sell-off looks disproportionate. That would hold true even accounting for broader impacts on the cruise business. Americans are, for example, less inclined to travel anywhere abroad during a distant epidemic. Moreover, the coronavirus has erupted during the peak period for bookings.Cruise shares fell a tenth during the 2003 Sars outbreak, recovering in just months, Morningstar analysts note. The trajectory of stocks may be the same this time. The difference is that the cruise industry, like the ships themselves, is now enormous.Before the coronavirus appeared, cruise liners were set to carry 32m passengers in 2020. That compares with 13m in 2004, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. Cruising is snobbishly dismissed as foreign travel for folks afraid of going abroad. Variety, comfort and the falling cost of cruise holidays have powered strong demand, even so.Demographics help. Ageing baby boomers are as inclined to book a cruise as they once were to hitchhike to Kathmandu. For newly-prosperous Asians, cruising is an unthreatening way to sample the novelty of foreign travel.Unfortunately, scale has disadvantages. Big cruise ships cost $500m and the fleet is growing 7 per cent a year, holding down prices. Returns on assets chug along at about 5 per cent annually.Shares trade at a discount of almost half the US average. Two issues menace the sector as oppressively as the liners that dwarf Venice as they pass. First, most ships are propelled by high-emission fuel oil. Second, hostility to passengers is growing in cities regularly swamped by them. These obvious negatives are better reasons to steer clear of cruise lines than the enigmatic coronavirus.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
9;CCL;Carnival Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
10;CCL;Carnival Corp;2019-06-20T11:58:49Z;Carnival cuts earnings outlook citing Cuba travel ban;;Cruise operator Carnival on Thursday lowered its full-year earnings outlook citing the Trump administration’s move to ban cruises to Cuba as well as disruptions to the company’s Carnival Vista ship.The Miami-based company said it now expects adjusted earnings of between $4.25 to $4.35 a share, compared with its March guidance of between $4.35 to $4.55 a share.Shares in the company fell 8 per cent in pre-market trade on the news to $48.50. Rivals followed suit with shares in Royal Caribbean Cruises down 4.2 per cent and Norwegian Cruise Lines down 3.6 per cent in early trade.“Recent booking trends have been impacted by ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds affecting our Continental European brands,” said chief executive Arnold Donald. “This year our growth has been hampered by a confluence of events, which we are focused on mitigating,” he added.Voyage disruptions related to Carnival Vista are expected to have an impact of about 8 to 10 cents a share, while the policy change on Cuba is projected to have an impact of about 4 to 6 cents a share.“While the company was able to quickly adjust its itineraries to provide guests with attractive alternative vacation experiences, the suddenness of the regulatory change to this high yielding destination has led to a near-term impact on revenue yields,” the company said.A brief thaw in US-Cuba relations under former president Barack Obama had permitted “people-to-people educational travel” to the island. However, the Trump administration this month imposed new rules banning visits to the island via cruise ships, personal aircraft and boats and prohibited people-to-people travel. Cruise ships were diverted at sea after the June 4 announcement and an estimated 800,000 Americans with bookings for Cuba were told they must change their holiday plans.The company also noted a 50 basis-point adjustment to its net revenue yield guidance “due to lower ticket prices forecasted in the second half of the year” but said this would be partially offset by lower fuel consumption and changes in fuel prices and exchange rates since its March guidance.The weaker outlook came alongside an 11 per cent increase in second-quarter revenues to $4.8bn, ahead of expectations for $4.5bn, according to a Refinitiv survey of Wall Street analysts.Net income slid to $451m or 65 cents a share in the three months ended May 31, down from $561m or 78 cents a share in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 66 cents a share, topped analysts estimates of 61 cents.
11;CCL;Carnival Corp;2019-06-04T23:15:26Z;Carnival cruise ships more polluting than all of Europe’s cars;Company operates seven of the 20 most polluting cruise ship lines, finds report;Cruise brands run by Carnival Corporation emitted 10 times more cancer-causing gases in Europe than all of the continent’s passenger vehicles combined, according to data released on Wednesday.A study of 203 cruise ships at sail in Europe in 2017, carried out by the European think-tank Transport & Environment, found that of the 20 most polluting cruise ship lines, seven were operated by Carnival-owned brands. In total cruise lines emitted more than 60 kilotonnes of sulphur dioxide, a cause of acid rain and lung cancer.The report comes just days after Carnival agreed to pay a $20m fine and undertake increased monitoring after it was found to still be dumping sewage and plastic waste, leaking gas and dirty water and falsifying records of incidents.In 2016 the company pleaded guilty to dumping oily waste from its Princess Line ships, and was fined $40m and put on a five-year probation but on Monday it admitted to violating that probation in a Miami court.Our aspiration is to leave the places we touch even better than when we first arrivedFaig Abbasov, shipping policy manager at Transport & Environment, said cruises were “a public-facing segment and their image and reputation with customers should matter. But customers themselves don’t know that they are facing such a huge amount of air pollution when they think they’ve got away from the city.”Sulphur dioxide emissions from cars was 3.2m kt versus 62m kt from cruise ships, with Carnival accounting for half that, the study found.The shipping industry has come under increasing scrutiny for its environmental record in recent years ahead of new regulations that will limit the amount of sulphur dioxide emitted by ships, set to come into force in 2020.But Mr Abbasov said that even once the new sulphur standards have been enforced, cruise ship emissions will still remain considerably larger than those of the more than 260m cars in Europe.“The irony is that Trump’s US is better protected from ships than this ambitious Europe,” he said.The entire US coastline is covered by a sulphur emission control area, while in Europe only the Baltic and North Seas have such protected status. The US also has more stringent nitrogen oxide emission regulation.The study further measured the impact of cruise ships when in port.It found that Barcelona, Palma Mallorca and Venice were the worst affected by sulphur dioxide emissions, adding that countries in the Mediterranean basin had the highest levels of sulphur dioxide from cruise ships due to both being a tourist hub and not being in a protected zone.Mr Abbasov said that European regulation of the industry was too fragmented and that international rules would only apply to new ships.Part of the problem in ports is that marine fossil fuel is not taxed, while shore-side electricity is under a 2003 EU energy tax directive, making it cheaper for ships to run the electricity needed for their restaurants and on-ship entertainment by burning fuel when in port. Few European ports or ships have invested in shore-side electricity infrastructure.Carnival is the world’s largest cruise operator with nearly 50 per cent of market share across nine brands.The FTSE 100-listed company said in a statement: “Carnival Corporation remains committed to environmental excellence and protecting the environment in which we live, work and travel. Our aspiration is to leave the places we touch even better than when we first arrived.”
12;CCL;Carnival Corp;2019-06-03T21:38:38Z;Carnival reaches $20m settlement over pollution allegations;;Carnival, the world’s largest cruise operator, has agreed to pay a $20m fine and enforce better environmental standards after it was found to have been violating a previous probation for discharging oily waste into the sea.A Miami judge ruled in favour of a settlement with US prosecutors on Monday in front of Carnival chief executive Arnold Donald and its chairman, the billionaire owner of the Miami Heat basketball team, Micky Arison, in what one environmental campaigner said was an “unprecedented situation”.Carnival is currently on probation for illegally dumping oily waste from its Princess Line cruise ships for which it was first indicted in 2016. It was Carnival’s third conviction for the same crime since 1998.Carnival, which runs nine cruise lines including Cunard and P&O, pleaded guilty to seven charges of environmental damage at the time. It was fined $40m and put on probation with a court appointed monitor to ensure it was complying with environmental standards.However, according to a previously confidential report published in April, it was found that Carnival had continued to dump sewage and plastic waste, leak gas, oil and dirty water, and falsify records of incidents. The report listed 834 separate occurrences.“It is very unusual to order top executives of a publicly traded corporation into court. But it is also very unusual to have a corporation that is a recidivist felon as we do here,” said Knoll Lowney, the lawyer representing victims of Carnival’s environmental damage.“We cannot just slap Carnival on the wrist again and allow it to continue its ‘criminal as usual’ business practices,” he added.In the proposed settlement, Carnival acknowledged that its Princess Line had violated the terms of its probation. In order to settle the case, it said that it would agree to having 15 additional audits of its ships, improve training and waste management, and better report incidents of environmental damage.If Carnival does not submit a new environmental compliance plan by September 13, it will be subject to fines of $1m per day.Patricia Seitz, the judge ruling the case, has previously taken a hardline stance against the company. In April she stated that the original $40m was “a drop in the bucket” and threatened to block Carnival cruise ships from docking at all US ports.Monday’s hearing was the first time that people directly affected by Carnival’s pollution have been able to testify in the case.Fotini Tsvaousis Duncombe, co-founder of Bahamian-based environmental group reEarth who was one of the witnesses, said that cruise accounts for 75 per cent of the Bahamas’ tourists but only 11 per cent of tourism spend.“Carnival is using the Bahamas like a toilet. It is a small country and we need our corporate partners to act responsibly,” she said.Other witnesses included Alaskan commercial fishermen who said that pollution from the cruise ships had a “dramatic impact” on their livelihoods.But others say that Carnival’s activities are important for the tourism industry.In a letter submitted to the court before the hearing, Roger Dow, president of the US Travel Association, wrote: “Anything that helps the Carnival Corporation grow is a net positive for American jobs and prosperity.”The president of Carnival, Christine Duffy, also serves as vice-chair of the US Travel Association.In its most recent annual report, Carnival said that it had made “many notable achievements in [its] sustainability efforts” and that when spending on capital it aimed to comply with, if not “exceed all relevant legal and statutory requirements related to health, environment, safety, security and sustainability”.
13;CCL;Carnival Corp;2018-06-25T16:57:45Z;Carnival drags cruise liners lower after outlook cut;Carnival shares eye worst day since 2012;Cruise operator Carnival on Monday blamed higher fuel prices and strength in the US dollar for the cut to its full-year earnings outlook, leaving its shares eyeing their biggest one-day drop in more than six years and dragging its peers lower.The Florida-based company, which operates Costa and Princess brands, lowered its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of between $4.15 to $4.25 a share, down from $4.20 to $4.40 a share previously, primarily blaming fuel and currency for a 19 cent a share hit. For the current quarter, Carnival forecast earnings of between $2.25 to $2.29 a share, shy of analyst estimates for $2.47, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.Fuel is a major cost for cruiseliners and Carnival’s cut comes as oil prices climbed to their highest level in nearly four years last month, with Brent rising above $80 a barrel.Carnival also noted that advanced bookings for the next three quarters are in line with the prior year at higher prices. “Though this is a very preliminary data point, we believe bears who are concerned with the industry’s ability to profitably absorb the acceleration in forward capacity growth are likely running with it,” said Steven Wieczynski, analyst at Stifel, who added he is “surprised by the magnitude” of the sell-off in Carnival shares.Indeed, shares fell 9 per cent to $57.82, leaving the company eyeing its biggest one-day drop since January 2012. The concerns also helped drag rivals lower with Royal Caribbean shares falling 5 per cent to $105.69, while Norwegian Cruise Line Holding shares declined more than 7 per cent to $48.10.The disappointing outlook came alongside second-quarter revenues that rose 10.4 per cent from a year ago to a quarterly record of $4.4bn, just ahead of estimates. That reflected an 11 per cent increase in passenger ticket revenues and an 8.3 per cent increase in onboard spending.Meanwhile, net income rose to $561m or 78 cents a share, compared with $379m or 52 cents a share in the year ago quarter. Adjusted earnings of 68 cents a share, topped analyst expectations for 60 cents, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.Carnival has tried to distinguish itself from rivals as the global cruise industry is expected to swell to 27.2m passengers in 2018 up from about 25.8m last year, according to Cruise Lines International Association. The Carnival Horizon cruiseliner, which launched earlier this year, has seen the company team up with Food Network personality Guy Fieri once again as it boasts a new barbecue joint, Guy’s Pig & Anchor Bar-B-Que Smokehouse, that is complemented with beers brewed on board. The ship also boasts a Dr Seuss-themed aqua park.Carnival shares are down nearly 14 per cent year-to-date.
14;CCL;Carnival Corp;2017-12-28T21:00:26Z;China cruises struggle to make it through political squalls;Operators cut back as travel restrictions and falling prices weigh on revenues;The number of Chinese cruise passengers is set to fall for the first time next year as lines redeploy ships from what had been the industry’s most promising market, deterred by falling prices and restrictions on travel to South Korea.About 2.4m Chinese will take cruises in 2018, down from 2.8m this year, according to Cruise Industry News, an industry journal, as almost all operators in the Chinese market reduce capacity.Cruise passenger numbers grew 70 per cent annually in China in the four years through 2016, according to Goldman Sachs. This year the country accounted for 5-10 per cent of all ship deployment for Royal Caribbean and Carnival, two US cruise operators that together control about 70 per cent of the global market. Both companies are cutting the number of ships deployed to China next year. For instance, Royal Caribbean’s 3,800-capacity Mariner of the Seas will return to the US. “International cruise lines are going to trim down their capacity,” said Zinan Liu, China president for Royal Caribbean, adding that “next year the passenger numbers could be less”.Carnival’s Princess Cruises had two ships in China this year but will relocate one to Europe and another to Australia next year. “We are letting the market find equilibrium,” said Anthony Kaufmann, vice-president for international operations.I deserve a much higher ticket price than I am getting todayCarnival’s decision to cut cruise capacity “arguably confirms that China has not lived up to expectations”, Morgan Stanley said. The bank added that charter rates paid by travel agencies for ship places were down as much as 20 per cent in 2017 from the previous year.China bars cruise lines from selling directly to passengers, leaving the lines at the mercy of travel agents who can discount heavily to fill ships.“All these new ships were here and it was hard to fill them, so prices went down,” said Ken Muskat, chief executive of SkySea Cruise Line, a joint venture between Royal Caribbean and Ctrip, China’s biggest online travel agency. “I deserve a much higher ticket price than I am getting today,” he added. The industry has been dealt a blow by Beijing’s bans in March and again in December on group tours to South Korea because of its objection to Seoul’s deployment of the US-built Thaad missile defence system. Mr Liu said “geopolitics” was the main reason for the industry’s struggles this year. But while the tension between Beijing and Seoul has hit local tourism, there are fundamental problems. Chinese passengers are more elderly than their global counterparts and tend to spend less on food and drink, say cruise line staff.Choppy seas and cold weather around most of China in winter mean demand is highly seasonal, while port infrastructure has lagged behind, making for long and uncomfortable waits for boarding.But cruise operators see long-term potential because of the low penetration of cruises in China, where just 0.2 per cent of the population have cruised compared with 3.5 per cent in the US.Cruise companies also are trying to enhance their appeal to higher-spending millennials. Royal Caribbean’s Quantum of the Seas, which sails from Shanghai, features a skydiving simulator and an observation pod attached to a giant mechanical arm. “The market may be choppy at least for the next few years,” S&P Global Ratings said, but “we expect operators will continue to invest in the market over the long run.”Twitter: @hancocktom
15;CCL;Carnival Corp;2017-12-19T20:09:55Z;Higher prices help Carnival offset hurricanes hit;Cruise operator reports eighth consecutive quarter of rising revenues;Higher ticket prices prompted Carnival Corp to strike an optimistic tone on the new year and helped the cruise operator offset a hit from hurricane-related disruptions.“Despite booking disruptions from this year’s multiple hurricanes, we are still heading into 2018 with a stronger base of business and higher prices than last year,” Arnold Donald, chief executive, said on Tuesday.The forecast full-year adjusted earnings of between $4 and $4.30 a share. That compared to the average analyst estimate of $4.29 a share.Based on current booking trends, Carnival also said it expected full-year net revenue yields, an industry measure of cruise segment revenue performance, to be up about 2.5 per cent in constant currency terms compared to the previous year.The company also beat expectations for the eighth consecutive quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.In its fiscal fourth quarter, Carnival said that revenues had risen more than 8 per cent to $4.26bn, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $4.15bn, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.The shares rose as much as 3.2 per cent to $68.74 in lunchtime New York trading.The company noted that disruptions from a string of hurricanes reduced its fourth-quarter earnings by about 11 cents a share, while changes in fuel prices decreased earnings by about 3 cents a share. Adjusted for one-time items, earnings of 63 cents a share topped estimates of 51 cents.Meanwhile, net income slid to $546m in the three months ended in November from $609m in the year-ago quarter.That translated to earnings of 76 cents a share, down from 83 cents a share in the year ago period but ahead of analysts’ estimates for 56 cents.

17;CCL;Carnival Corp;2017-03-28T14:00:45Z;Cruise operator Carnival raises profit outlook as bookings rise;;"Carnival, the cruise operator, has raised its profit forecast for fiscal year 2017, which it credited to an increased number of bookings at higher prices for the rest of the year.The Miami-based company, which is dual listed in the US and UK, on Tuesday raised its outlook for full-year earnings per share to $3.50-$3.70, versus the $3.30-$3.60 range it had previously expected, and above the $3.45 it posted for FY 2016.However, it warned that the current quarter would see earnings per share dip on a year-over-year basis, to 43-47 cents a share, compared to 49 cents in the same three-month period in 2016, as unfavourable changes in fuel prices and currency conversion take a bite out of the ocean-going vacation company’s bottom line.For the three months to February 28, Carnival — the owner of brands including P&O Cruises, Holland America and Costa — reported adjusted earnings per share of 38 cents per share, on a total net income of $279m, excluding one-time items. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had looked for earnings per share of 35 cents on net income of $250.83m. Changes in fuel prices and currency adjustments docked 13 cents a share from itsRevenues for the quarter were $3.8bn, in line with Wall Street’s expectations. The company had previously forecast revenues for the full year to rise 2.5 per cent on a constant currency basis; on Tuesday, Carnival revised that figure upwards to reflect expectations for a 3 per cent year-on-year rise.Carnival president and chief executive Arnold Donald said in a statement:“We are off to a good start delivering another quarter of operational improvement on top of a very strong first quarter last year. Our performance was driven by increased demand, particularly for our core Caribbean itineraries, leading to higher year-over-year ticket prices which enabled us to overcome the significant negative impact of both fuel and currency to exceed the high end of our guidance range.”Mr Donald has been working to turn the company around after it was hit by a series of disasters including the sinking of the Costa Concordia cruise ship in 2012 and a 2013 power outage on the Carnival Triumph that left it stranded at sea for four days. It was hit with a $40m penalty in a US federal court in December after pleading guilty to dumping polluting waste in the sea off the coast of England.New York-listed shares in the group have risen 20 per cent in the last 12 months. Following its quarterly results, Carnival shares were up nearly 2 per cent in early US trading."
18;CCL;Carnival Corp;2017-01-08T12:24:37Z;Arnold Donald: “It stopped working because the world changed”;Carnival Cruise leader on how he turned the company around;"On Southampton’s concrete docks under a sky heavy with drizzle, tourists — most of them middle aged — crane their necks at the horizon. In the slate-grey river beside them towers a cruise ship that will carry them to the Solent strait and the blue waters of the Caribbean beyond.The age of the cruise crowd illustrates a problem that Arnold Donald of Carnival Cruises is grappling with 4,000 miles away in his office in sunny Miami, Florida. The chief executive of the world’s largest cruise company not only has to lead a business that carries 11m passengers on its ships every year. He also has to secure its profitable future against a strong, demographic challenge.Many within the tourism industry are sceptical about whether cruise companies have a future with younger generations of travellers. Cruising, says one executive at Carnival speaking on condition of anonymity, is for “the newly-weds, the nearly-deads and no one in between”.“When I first got the call [to become chief executive] I almost said no,” says Mr Donald in a relaxed drawl. “It took two or three days before I called back.”That was not only because of the problem of enticing millennials on to cruise ships. The multiple risks involved with transporting so many people every year mean running Carnival is a difficult task.The company, which owns brands including P&O Cruises, Holland America and Costa, was handed a $40m penalty in a US federal court in December after pleading guilty to dumping polluting waste in the sea off the coast of England.But Mr Donald, who sat on Carnival’s board for more than a decade, is used to adversity. First came the sinking of the Costa Concordia cruise ship in 2012 — 33 people were killed. In 2014 a power outage hit the Carnival Triumph, which became known as the “poop cruise” because its toilets stopped working.“The media were pretty brutal to us,” he says.After taking over as chief executive from Micky Arison, who is now chairman, Mr Donald instigated reviews of culture and operations in response to the Costa Concordia disaster: “Just to right that ship and float it out cost millions,” he says.Three years into the job, Mr Donald is credited with turning around Carnival’s reputation and its market value. Net profits rose to $2.8bn in 2016, up from $1.8bn the year before. The 62-year-old secured a joint venture in China to gain access to a growing tourism market in east Asia. Bookings have increased steadily.The US-based company is in a comfortable position because it dominates the industry and takes more than half of all cruisers on holiday, but it may have run out of space to grow. Carnival is under pressure to retire its older ships and refresh its image, as the company enters a technological race with rivals to attract younger cruisers. One person familiar with the company says Mr Donald has pushed this agenda — sometimes to the chagrin of colleagues on the board.Mr Donald insists that it is important for Carnival to modernise: “We built this business on a premise that works really well, which was to organically grow a brand and acquire other brands.“It stopped working because the world changed . . . with the BP oil spill, then Lehman Brothers, then the Arab spring, which caused people to not to want to travel.”Mr Donald describes his humble origins at the back end of the civil rights movement in the late 1960s, growing up in a “very poor” family from the ninth ward of New Orleans. As an aspirational child, he secured a place to study engineering at Washington University and joined Monsanto, the global agribusiness, after graduating.After 23 years at Monsanto and a brief stint as chief executive of Merisant, a manufacturer of artificial sweeteners, Mr Donald was ready to retire before he accepted the Carnival job — which paid him $9.4m in 2015. His package includes stock and other benefits.He emits a sense of ambition that others in the industry say has propelled the company forward. However, according to an independent analyst who did not want to be named, investors had wondered whether decision making would remain with Mr Arison, a member of the founding family.“We thought maybe Micky wants to get out of the limelight so Arnold will take over and just be Micky’s guy,” the analyst says.A former colleague from Monsanto adds that they were “surprised” when they heard that Mr Donald had joined Carnival. “He’s a very ambitious fellow, but what does he know about running cruise liners?”Although Carnival — and the industry — have recovered from the Costa Concordia disaster, Mr Donald fears a change in global attitudes towards terror could undermine the business.“Whether the world acts out of fear, whether the world overreacts, that’s what keeps me awake [at night],” he says.For now, Mr Donald is focused on taking advantage of scale, which he calls “the yin and yang of being big”. Since 2013 he has attempted to cut costs, but he balks at the idea that Carnival’s 10 brands may come together in Miami. “No, no, no, we’re not centralising. I don’t believe in centralising,” he says.Carnival announced a joint venture with the China State Shipbuilding Corporation and China Investment Corporation in 2014. Three new luxury ships are due to join its fleet of four in the country over the next two years.At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, he unveiled a wearable device for cruise passengers, equipping them with a personal digital concierge that recommends activities. But rivals are expanding and innovating and some question whether so many cruise ship berths can be filled by future
generations.“We’re huge,” Mr Donald says. “If people cruise then we’re all good.”Philip Needleman is head of research and development at Monsanto and worked with Mr Donald in the early 1990s. His former colleague was an “innovator” who was focused on science at a time when many business people did not understand the technology that underpinned the agribusiness.“He was the only African-American senior person I was aware of at Monsanto. His performance was hard nosed, measured by quarterly business and where sales were at,” he says."

Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 80 cents a share on sales of $693m.Same-store sales, an important industry metric, advanced 5 per cent, above forecasts for a 4.7 per cent gain.Lululemon, which has benefited from the “athleisure” trend for sports clothing to be worn outside the gym, said its inventories “may even begin to look lean”.Gross margin decreased by 120 basis points, a more modest decline than feared.“Perhaps more importantly, inventory levels are leaner than expected [nearly in line with comparable sales growth] and at the same time gross margin came in well better than consensus,” said Paul Lejuez, an analyst at Citigroup.“This combination helps discredit the bear thesis that Lululemon would need to take a big gross margin hit to get its elevated inventories in line.”Lululemon has made headway since 2013 when it recalled yoga pants that were judged to be too sheer.For fiscal 2017 the company expects sales in the range of $2.29bn to $2.34bn, compared with estimates of $2.33bn. In the current quarter sales look likely to be between $483m and $488m, against expectations of $485.4m.Lululemon’s advance came alongside a broader, if moderate, stock rally. At the close, the S&P 500 had climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,063.95, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 17,716.66, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 4,869.29.Global markets advanced after dovish remarks on Tuesday by Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve chair, as hopes that US rates will remain lower for longer drummed up demand for risk assets.Carnival shares rose 5.5 per cent to $52.37 after upbeat fiscal first-quarter results, aided by a decline in fuel costs.The cruise operator said profits had nearly tripled to $142m, or 18 cents a share, in the three months to the end of February.Adjusting for one-off items, however, earnings of 38 cents a share eclipsed Wall Street estimates for 32 cents.

20;CCL;Carnival Corp;2016-01-28T19:17:06Z;Cruise operators, airlines hit as Zika worries rise;;The Zika virus, a mosquito born disease that has caused alarm for travellers visiting tropical South American countries, appears to be alarming investors as well.Shares in cruise operators and airlines took a hit on Thursday amid growing concerns that the virus could dissuade tourists from heading to the Caribbean after the World Health Organisation warned that the “explosive spread” of Zika is “extremely worrying”.The virus, which has been identified in 21 countries in Central and South America, has been tied to a jump in birth defects.Many operators have issued travel advisories and have offered to accommodate changes to bookings for pregnant women that could be impacted by the disease, while airlines have offered to refund or rebook passengers flying to infected regions.Dave Lutz, head of ETFs at Jones Trading, said:I would say that the Zika headlines, coupled with the recent spike in oil prices (almost 30 per cent in 8 days) are a massive headwind for airlines and cruise ships.Here’s a snapshot of how shares of cruise operators were trading on Thursday:But is the sell-off being overdone? Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen, said while she thinks there could be slower bookings “during a time of heightened media coverage and general fear”, she views the drop in airline shares as a “buying opportunity”.“We do not view this virus on the same level as the Ebola outbreak in late 2014 or SARS in 2003,” she noted.Click here to read more on the Zika virus.
21;CCL;Carnival Corp;2015-12-18T20:39:51Z;Carnival buoyed by fuel and ticket prices;Cruise operator almost doubles profit after discounting less;Carnival, the world’s biggest cruise company by market share, has almost doubled its annual profit, after booming demand for cruise holidays helped it sell more tickets at full price.For the year to November 30, Carnival — which sells more than half of all cruise holidays taken each year — posted pre-tax profit of $1.8bn, an increase of 46.9 per cent on the previous 12 month period.It attributed part of the improvement to achieving higher prices and said it planned to limit ticket discounts in the year ahead. Bookings for next year “are well ahead of the prior year at slightly higher constant currency prices”, the company said.“You’re not going to let cabins go unfilled so there will be some discounting but our goal is to have less discounting than the prior year,” Arnold Donald, chief executive, said.For Carnival, which operates the Costa and Princess brands, this will mean discounting fewer berths on each ship and making discounts shallower, Mr Donald said.Cruise lines typically cut prices to fill ships as departure dates approach. But, with more ships than ever due to launch next year — and capacity forecast to grow 6.4 per cent — selling tickets at higher prices will be crucial to protecting margins.On Friday, Carnival forecast that its ticket income per person per day, a key metric in the cruise industry, would be up 2 per cent in 2016 — not including a 1 per cent uplift from an accounting change. This year, ticket income per person per day rose 3.2 per cent on its 2014 level.As a result, Mr Donald said he expected continued yield improvement in 2016 and predicted that Carnival would be well placed to achieve its target of a double digit return on invested capital in the next two to three years.Carnival’s total annual revenues were 1 per cent lower than the year before, at $15.7bn, but its profit benefited from lower than expected fuel costs.Steven Kent, equity analyst at Goldman Sachs, said this was, in part, due to lower fuel prices but also to Carnival’s investment in fuel efficient technologies.Mr Kent suggested the company’s 2016 guidance would be well received. “It looks like the company’s effort to extend the booking curve to reduce close-in discounting is beginning to play out well,” he said.Carnival made a big move into the Chinese holiday market in 2015, announcing a joint venture with the China State Shipbuilding Corporation and China Investment Corporation. Six Carnival ships will operate in China in 2016, with a seventh due to launch there in 2017.Responding to concerns that China might not yet be a big enough market, Mr Donald said cruise liners were seeing only “the tip of the iceberg” of Chinese demand.“Demand is already there, the issue is connecting that demand to the ships,” he said.Carnival shares rose 3.9 per cent to $52.41 in New York on Friday.
22;CCL;Carnival Corp;2015-10-22T18:07:12Z;Number 10 coy over deal inflation after Xi’s state visit;Prime minister’s office struggles to explain how valuation of Sino-British agreements leapt to £40bn;Sajid Javid, the business secretary, on Tuesday announced that President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Britain would be crowned by £25bn of Sino-British trade deals. Downing Street then increased the estimate to “up to £30bn”.By the time he arrived at Mansion House on Wednesday night, David Cameron was wielding an even headier figure of £40bn — which found its way into countless news headlines.Mr Xi headed for Chequers for dinner with Mr Cameron — and a visit to a local pub for a pint and some fish and chips — as he prepared to visit Manchester on the final day of his four-day state visit. But Number 10 struggled to explain the curious bout of deal inflation.“I don’t really know where that £40bn figure has come from,” said one government aide.Two senior Whitehall figures said the number was only obtained by adding £12bn of future expenditure on Hinkley Point nuclear power station by EDF, the French energy company. Downing Street denied that claim.Meanwhile analysis by the Financial Times suggests that even the less ambitious estimates may have involved some generous interpretation. Downing Street refused to explain how it had made its calculations, suggesting that some deals were yet to be announced.A press officer said there would not be a “full breakdown of figures and agreements” until the Chinese delegation had left.Officials have attributed a value of £1.7bn to a deal to rebuild Royal Albert Docks in east London: in reality a Chinese investor has merely bought a minority equity stake in the project from the Chinese developer that controls the site.An agreement for BP to sell liquefied natural gas to China Huadian Corporation has a headline value of £6.5bn: but it stretches over 20 years.Also included is a £2.6bn agreement — over 10 years — between two Chinese groups and Carnival, the world’s biggest cruise company, which has a joint listing in London but has its headquarters in Miami.Critics say that the government is playing up the value of its deals with China in an effort to prove that its courtship of Beijing is reaping rewards.“For political reasons, the government needs to show it is maximising Chinese investment,” said Tony Travers, director of the London School of Economics.George Osborne, the chancellor, has sought alternative sources of capital — instead of the usual taxpayer funding — to help pay for infrastructure schemes during a period of fiscal austerity.Until recently governments used the controversial private finance initiative (PFI) to build hospitals, roads and schools and to keep the debts off its balance sheet.For political reasons, the government needs to show it is maximising Chinese investmentBut Mr Osborne has described PFI as “discredited”. A remodelled version of the PFI scheme — PFI2 — has also been used only rarely.Other attempts to attract money from the private sector included a move to raise £20bn from pension funds: but that has so far raised just £1bn.Concerns remain that taxpayers will still end up paying more for infrastructure than if the government had borrowed the money to invest directly.Ian Byatt, who led the privatisation of the water industry in 1989, says: “If the project has been mandated and specified by the government, it should be financed by government through Treasury borrowing.”They say: “Chinese investment to build two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. Hinkley Point C will generate a stable source of clean power to nearly 6m homes, and will provide up to 25,000 employment opportunities. In operation, Hinkley Point C will employ around 900 permanent staff.”FT verdict: The deal is between one foreign company, EDF, and another, China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN). It should pave the way for the Chinese to spend £6bn on construction of the project, although some of this will come from debt rather than equity.It also seems that Mr Cameron may have included the entire £18bn project — of which £12bn is from EDF — in his £40bn overall figure for deals.They say: “Citic, a major state-owned Chinese investment group, will become the main contractor for the Royal Albert Docks regeneration project. The project is worth £1.7bn and Citic is taking 40 per cent equity.”FT verdict: Citic is only a junior equity partner in the scheme, taking a 40 per cent stake in an investment group that owns 25 per cent of the Royal Albert Dock project. The site developer ABP (China) Holdings has also been negotiating — so far unsuccessfully — to raise money from a different group, China Minsheng.The value of the construction work will be limited because Citic is expected to take on a UK partner, such as Mace or Laing O’Rourke.While ABP expects the entire project to cost £1.7bn, the first phase of the scheme is only an estimated £300m. The second and third phases only have outline planning permission.They say: “Carnival UK and CSSC agreed a £2.6bn 50/50 joint venture to buy or build seven new cruise ships over the next 10 years.”FT verdict: The official statement from the company referred not to “Carnival UK” but to “Carnival Corporation and plc”, which is a global business listed in both New York and London. It is joining up with China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) and China Investment Corporation (CIC).The ships will fly under the British flag, pay UK tonnage tax and be insured in London — supporting hundreds of UK jobs. Any new ships built will be assembled in China but will have British components. Yet Carnival’s headquarters are in Miami, Florida.They say: “The UK-listed oil group and China Huadian Corporation today signed a sale-and-purchase agreement for BP to sell Huadian up to 1m tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year worth up to £6.5bn over the next 20 years. Also BP and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) entered into a framework agreement on strategic co-operation covering potential shale gas exploration and production in the Sichuan Basin, future fuel retailing ventures in China, and other international partnerships.FT verdict: The agreements sound impressive in scope but the £6.5bn figure is only achieved over a period of two decades. Technically this is not an investment but rather a market value placed on the future supply of LNG.They say: “Rolls-Royce is today announcing a deal with HNA Group to provide Trent 700 engines to power 20 Airbus A330s. Rolls-Royce and HNA Group have also agreed a TotalCare package for a further nine Trent 700 engines and 15 Trent XWB engines.FT verdict: This is a genuinely new deal providing both engines and services to HNA Group, a conglomerate that operates airlines including Hainan, Tianjin and Capital.They say: “LTC’s parent company, the leading Chinese automotive manufacturer Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, also announced its intention to invest an additional £50 million in its state of the art greenfield production facility in Ansty, Warwickshire, to turn the site into the group’s UK R&D headquarters. This will bring total investment in the new site to £300 million.”FT verdict: This has a whiff of déjà vu. In March Geely announced that it would invest £250m in its new facility at Ansty Park. The new announcement raised that old figure to £300m.
23;CCL;Carnival Corp;2015-07-31T16:59:04Z;Cruise operator Royal Caribbean enjoys plain sailing;Energy is worst performing sector among US stocks;Royal Caribbean shares set sail after the cruise operator lifted its full-year sales forecast, noting strength in the Caribbean and China.The Miami-based company now sees full-year earnings in the range of $4.65 to $4.75 a share, from its previous outlook for $4.45 to $4.65 a share. This topped analysts’ estimates for $4.61 a share.Royal Caribbean said bookings since its last earnings call have been “healthy”.The company added that bookings for the first quarter of next year are “running well ahead of last year at higher prices” and that improvements in the Caribbean are continuing at a “robust pace”.The news came alongside profits of $185m or 84 cents a share in the three months ended in June, compared with $137m or 62 cents a share in the prior-year period. This topped analysts’ expectations for earnings of 73 cents a share.Sales rose 4 per cent to $2.06bn in line with forecasts.“We believe the presence of rational new capacity growth, for both Royal Caribbean and the industry at large, coupled with further strengthening in Caribbean pricing, an emerging Asian growth story, and a stable cost structure, leaves Royal Caribbean well positioned to deliver upon its longer-duration ‘double-double’ growth initiatives,” said Steve Wieczynski, an analyst at Stifel.The company unveiled its double-double programme last year — doubling its 2014 earning per share and increasing its return on invested capital to double digits.Shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises, which have advanced 50 per cent in the past year, rose 8.6 per cent to close at $89.85.The company’s commentary on strength in the Caribbean, a key market for cruise operators also buoyed its rivals.Shares of Carnival Corp rose 2.7 per cent to close at $53.29 and shares of Norwegian Cruise Line gained 4.6 per cent to close at $62.42.Better than expected second-quarter results pushed Expedia up nearly 13 per cent to close at $121.44.The online travel booking site reported profits of $449.6m or $3.38 a share, compared with $89.3m or 67 cents a share in the previous-year period. Sales rose 11 per cent to $1.7bn.Analysts forecast earnings of 55 cents a share, on sales of $1.7bn. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.02 a share topped forecasts for 87 cents.ExxonMobil shares fell 4.6 per cent to close at $79.21 after the world’s largest oil company by market valuation reported a more than 50 per cent drop in second-quarter profits.The company said profits fell to $4.2bn or $1 a share, from $8.8bn or $2.05 a share and missed expectations. Sales fell 33 per cent to $74bn but topped forecasts.Chevron shares fell 4.9 per cent to close at $88.48 after the energy company reported a drop in second-quarter profits that came in shy of analysts’ estimates.The disappointing results from the energy companies come as the price of Brent crude remains nearly 50 per cent lower than year-ago levels.The S&P 500 energy index was the worst performing sector on the benchmark index, falling 2.6 per cent.The S&P 500 fell 0.23 per cent to 2,103.84, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.32 per cent at 17,689.86 and the Nasdaq Composite was little changed closing at 5,128.28.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
24;CCL;Carnival Corp;2015-03-27T16:59:15Z;Carnival beats forecast as fuel prices drop;Marketing efforts and courtship of Chinese market pays off;Carnival Corp, the world’s biggest cruise ship operator, reported better than expected results on Friday, as fuel prices dropped and the company’s marketing efforts paid off.Carnival reported net income of $49m in the three months ended in February, up from a $20m loss in the same period last year, on revenues of $3.5bn, which were down marginally.“Currency continues to be a headwind, which is why if you look at the reported numbers they are not looking so healthy,” said Stuart Gordon at Berenberg.Since December, unfavourable changes in currency exchange rates have brought earnings expectations for the 2015 year down by $219m, or $0.28 a share, the company said in a statement on Friday.On a constant currency basis, however, Friday’s figures show a strong performance.Net revenues per available lower berth day — the unit used to measure available accommodation — were up 2 per cent year-on-year in constant dollars, where the group had forecast an increase of less than 1 per cent in December.Adjusting for certain items, Carnival said it earned 20 cents a share. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast adjusted earnings of 9 cents a share, on sales of $3.57bn.Shares in Carnival were up 6 per cent to $47.12 by 4.45pm in London, following the results.Chief executive Arnold Donald attributed growth in the quarter to a rise in onboard revenues, which were up 8 per cent year-on-year in constant currency terms.The rapid drop in global oil prices has brought down costs at the Miami-based group, with fuel prices down 38 per cent year-on-year to $406 per metric ton in the quarter.“The year is off to a strong start,” Mr Donald said on Friday.The company, whose reputation suffered following the Costa Concordia disaster off the Italian island of Giglio in 2012, has been helped by heavy marketing and public relations efforts that have attracted new customers to cruises.While repairing its reputation, Carnival is also courting the fast-growing Chinese market, where cruise holidays are growing popular among the expanding affluent middle-class.The group teamed up with China State Shipbuilding Corp last year to design and build China’s “first world-class cruise ship”, taking the state-owned CSSC into a new sector.Carnival also redeployed a European-based liner to Shanghai last year, forecasting that China will become the world’s second-largest market for cruises by 2017.
25;CCL;Carnival Corp;2015-03-27T15:24:26Z;Carnival buoyed by strong outlook for the year;Broad market struggles for direction;Carnival Corp shares were buoyed after the world’s largest cruise operator lifted its full-year outlook and said advance bookings for the remainder of the year were running ahead of 2014’s pace and at higher prices.The company, which owns the Cunard, Princess Cruises and Holland American lines, along with its namesake brand, said full-year net revenue yields would rise between 3 and 4 per cent this year in constant currencies, 100 basis points higher than its previous estimates.Yields in the cruise industry, a measure of passenger spending and ticket prices that excludes some of the sector’s largest variable costs, are closely scrutinised by analysts and investors for insight into the underlying performance of individual operator’s business.The outlook accompanied Carnival’s fiscal first-quarter results. The company swung to a profit of $49m, or 6 cents a share, in the three months to the end of February from a loss of $20m a year earlier. Sales fell 2 per cent to $3.53bn.Adjusting for certain items, Carnival said it earned 20 cents a share. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast adjusted earnings of 9 cents a share, on sales of $3.57bn.Arnold Donald, chief executive, said the year was off to a “strong start” with first-quarter onboard yields rising 8 per cent from the year-ago period.Steven Wieczynski, an analyst with Stifel, said the results, including a rise in yields, added to its conviction in the broader industry.“We sense the underlying booking environment continues to improve, the effects of which should overpower any impacts from unfavourable [foreign exchange] movements in the eyes of investors,” he said.Carnival shares, which have climbed 18 per cent in the past year, rose 6 per cent on Friday to $47.12.Shares of rival Royal Caribbean climbed 6 per cent to $79.85, while Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings rose 5 per cent to $53.82.Shares of American Eagle Outfitters fell 1 per cent to $16.69, after analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to “sell” from “neutral” while maintaining their $12 price target.Lindsay Drucker Mann, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said the teen retailer “is in the midst of a multiyear period of diminishing productivity, margins and returns” as it comes under pressure from declining mall traffic and “faces aggressive competition from low-cost competition including fast fashion retailers, outlet malls and off-price stores”.She also said ecommerce had added costs for the retailer but had failed to completely offset loss of sales at its brick and mortar stores.GameStop shares also declined 1 per cent to $38.36, after the US video game retailer reported fourth-quarter adjusted profit and sales that missed analysts’ estimates.The company said its profits climbed 11 per cent to $244m, or $2.23 a share. Revenues slid 6 per cent to $3.5bn. Adjusting for certain items, GameStop said it earned $2.15 a share, a penny below forecasts.US stocks fluctuated between modest gains and losses as oil prices slipped and after US consumer confidence climbed more than expected in March.The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent at 2,061.02, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also 0.2 per cent firmer at 17,712.66. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6 per cent to 4,891.22.
26;CCL;Carnival Corp;2015-02-11T20:21:36Z;Costa Concordia captain sentenced to 16 years in jail;Schettino guilty of manslaughter after death of 32 passengers;The captain of the Costa Concordia, the Italian cruise ship that capsized in January 2012 off Giglio island causing the death of 32 people, was sentenced to 16 years in prison by a court in Tuscany on Wednesday.A three-judge panel in Grosseto, where the trial opened in July 2013, found Francesco Schettino guilty of manslaughter. He was also convicted of causing shipwreck and abandoning ship, and was banned from holding public office for life.Unless Captain Schettino successfully appeals, the verdict marks the final chapter in a tragedy that shook many Italians as well as the country’s reputation. The sinking came during a severe economic downturn, at the height of the eurozone crisis, and two months after Silvio Berlusconi had resigned as prime minister under a cloud of sex scandals.Capt Schettino had always denied the charges, claiming he saved lives by steering the ship closer inshore after it hit a reef. He said he had not abandoned ship but had “tripped” into the lifeboat that brought him ashore before many of his passengers. And on Wednesday, before the verdict, he decried his vilification by the media in a tearful appearance before the court.“Along with the 32 victims of the shipwreck, I died too,” Capt Schettino said. “All the responsibility has been loaded onto me with no respect for the truth or for the memory of the victims,” he said.Maria Navarro, prosecuting, had requested 26 years at the end of January, accusing him of “lying to everyone … and never accepting responsibility.”Another member of the prosecution described Capt Schettino as “an incautious idiot”, accusing him of “conscious negligence” in the shipwreck during the closing arguments. Capt Schettino will remain free pending his appeal.On the night of the accident, the captain deviated from the ship’s route to perform a salute to the island, known as an inchino or “taking a bow”. However, he brought it too close to shore. The Costa Concordia struck rocks off the island, causing a 50-metre tear in its hull, which led the ship to lose electricity, engine power and eventually to sink.The 290m-long vessel, with more than 4,200 people in passengers and crew, had left the port of Civitavecchia only hours before and was at the start of a weeklong cruise around the Mediterranean. Capt Schettino initially minimised the scale of the accident and delayed the evacuation.Once that had begun, in the dark, some passengers tried to save themselves by jumping into the sea. More than 150 people were injured as well as the 32 who died.A reconstruction of how the Costa Concordia ran aground off the coast of ItalyIn July 2014 the ship was towed away and brought to Genoa, marking the end an unprecedented salvage operation. This consisted of several complicated engineering procedures and cost an estimated €1.5bn in total.The last victim’s body was recovered only in November last year, near three years after the sinking, by salvage workers from the consortium dismantling the ship.Five other defendants sought plea bargains in the case. Costa Cruises, owner of the Concordia, paid a €1m fine, thereby avoiding trial. It also agreed to pay thousands of euros in compensation to survivors. Carnival Corp, the world’s biggest cruise operator which owned Costa, was also hurt by the disaster, which cast a shadow over the whole sector.Meanwhile, the region of Tuscany and the island off which the Concordia sank have requested more than €200m in damages from Costa Cruises for the negative impact on the island. It had previously been known for its pristine coastline and maritime wildlife.“We must reclaim what the Costa Concordia shipwreck has taken away from us …After the ship’s departure, we are taking stock and counting the wounds,” said Sergio Ortelli, mayor of the island of Giglio on Saturday. He pointed out the “damage to the image of Giglio, which will now be always linked to the Concordia”.
27;CCL;Carnival Corp;2014-10-15T16:25:42Z;Chinese shipbuilder joins Carnival cruise venture;Joint venture to design and build China’s first luxury cruise vessels;China’s largest shipbuilder is setting sail into uncharted waters by building the country’s first cruise vessels, potentially opening a lucrative new sector for the struggling industry.Carnival Corporation, the world’s biggest cruise ship operator, said on Wednesday that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with China State Shipbuilding Corp to form a joint venture that would design and build China’s “first world-class cruise ship”.The Miami-based company added that the partnership could evolve into a “three-way arrangement” with Italy’s Fincantieri, the world’s largest cruise ship builder.If completed, the joint venture would propel state-owned CSSC into an entirely new sector, requiring much higher technical and safety standards, as illustrated by the 2012 Costa Concordia tragedy in which 32 people died. Most of the world’s cruise ships are built by European shipbuilders such as Fincantieri.“It’s certainly a step up from conventional commercial vessels,” said one industry analyst. “People are more precious than iron ore so there’s a lot more redundancies in a cruise ship’s systems. It’s the difference between making an old dump truck and a Lexus.”In addition to their hotel-like structures and amenities, cruise ships require much faster, cleaner and smoother-running engines. Carnival said it would provide “its ship design and shipbuilding expertise to create the vision, definition and overall specifications for the China-built cruise ship”.CSSC, one of China’s largest state-owned groups, with at least three listed arms, and Fincantieri were not immediately available for comment.Citing China’s transport ministry, Carnival said the country’s cruise market would soon become the world’s second-largest after the US, with a projected 4.5m passengers expected to set sail by 2020.Carnival announced in May that it was redeploying a European-based liner to Shanghai, which will be used year-round from April next year. The company has based three other cruise vessels in Chinese ports and is relocating its global chief operations officer to the country.Chinese shipbuilders have been struggling as a result of the overcapacity plaguing the industry, and their efforts to make higher-value vessels – such as liquefied natural gas carriers – have had mixed success in the face of stiff competition from South Korean and Japanese shipyards.China’s largest private-sector shipbuilder, Rongsheng, has had to restructure loans worth billions of renminbi with its creditors and is currently awaiting the completion of a state-directed bailout or restructuring.In a further indication of the difficult conditions affecting China’s heavy industrial companies as economic growth continues to slow, heavy equipment maker Zoomlion on Wednesday warned that third-quarter profit may fall as much as 75 per cent over the same period last year. The company’s Hong Kong-traded shares fell more than 4 per cent on the news.
28;CCL;Carnival Corp;2014-07-23T15:21:18Z;Costa Concordia begins final journey;;The Costa Concordia cruise ship began its journey to the port town of Genoa on Wednesday, leaving the island where it capsized more than two years ago and marking the conclusion of an unprecedented maritime salvage operation.The Concordia, being kept afloat by 30 hollow metal boxes, will be accompanied by 14 smaller vessels lead by the Blizzard, a Dutch tugboat.The cruise liner is expected to enter Genoa on Sunday morning and will be broken up in a scrapyard nearby. The demolition will be run by a consortium headed by Saipem, the Italian oil services group.“The ship left at 11am and is moving at the speed of two knots, northbound. All has functioned properly,” said Franco Porcellacchia, engineer in charge of the salvage operation.In January 2012 the 290-metre-long vessel sank off the island of Giglio after it struck a reef as it was steered close to the coast. The disaster caused the death of 32 passengers and crew members, and the body of one victim has still not been found.Costa Crociere, a unit of Carnival Corp, the world’s biggest cruise operator, has estimated the cost of the salvage operation, including the breaking up of the vessel, the towing and the damages on the island, to be more than €1.5bn.Carnival’s reputation and its share price suffered due to the disaster and high-profile problems on other ships.Micky Arison stepped aside as chief executive last year, to be replaced by Arnold Donald, who instigated reviews of the company’s culture and operations and embarked on a marketing campaign to repair its image.Manoeuvres to position the boat ahead of its last trip started in the early hours of Wednesday, following more than a week of refloating operations, which slowly lifted the 114,500-tonne ship.It fully emerged from the water for the first time on Sunday. The ship had been resting on underwater platforms off the coast of the Tuscan holiday island of Giglio since it had been pulled upright in September last year.The Concordia’s departure was delayed because of unfavourable weather conditions, but Nick Sloane, salvage master, said everything was going according to plan early on Wednesday.Franco Gabrielli, head of the national protection department, said: “The weather conditions can always present glitches, so we won’t count our chickens before they have hatched, [which is] when the ship will be in Genoa. Only then we will put the word ‘end’ to all of these events.”Captain Francesco Schettino is on trial on charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship. He denies the charges.
29;CCL;Carnival Corp;2014-06-24T16:49:38Z;Carnival returns to calmer waters following stronger earnings;;Carnival Corporation sailed towards smoother waters after reporting better than expected earnings, helped by a sustained marketing push and a better economic climate.The world’s biggest cruise operator said on Tuesday that second-quarter revenues were up $100m to $3.6bn, while net income improved from $57m for the same period last year to $80m.The company, whose reputation has suffered following the Costa Concordia disaster, had predicted a fall of 3 to 4 per cent in net revenue yields, measuring revenue per available berth, but the decline over the quarter was 2.2 per cent.Arnold Donald, chief executive, said the improvement in earnings was the result of a combination of better net revenue yields and reduced net costs.Net cruise costs excluding fuel grew 1.2 per cent compared with guidance of an increase of 2.5 to 3.5 per cent. Fuel costs were higher than expected but, at $657 a metric tonne, still represented a 3.7 per cent fall on the 2013 second quarter.Mr Donald said fuel consumption dropped 6 per cent, and he added that the improvement to net revenue yield would continue for the rest of the year.Carnival has been spending heavily on marketing to arrest setbacks that have damaged its reputation, most notably the Costa Concordia disaster off the Italian island of Giglio in 2012.The second quarter saw the debut of Regal Princess in Europe, part of the Princess Cruises brand, and Carnival’s announcement that it was deploying a ship to Shanghai to exploit the growing cruise market in China.Guidance for the full year is for higher revenues compared with 2013 but with a slight fall in net revenue yields.Improving cruise and fuel costs have prompted Carnival to increase earnings a share guidance to a range of $1.60 to $1.75. In 2013, Carnival made earnings a share of $1.58.Mr Donald highlighted tough competition in the Caribbean for the summer but said the drive for higher ticket prices was “gaining momentum”.He added: “We believe we have reached a positive inflection point for our company as we return to earnings growth in 2014 and work hard to ensure that growth accelerates in the years to come.”Shares were up in trading on the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday but then fell 2 per cent to 2,264p. A volatile share price over the past 12 months saw a low point of 2,022p in October and a high of 2,615p in January.
30;CCL;Carnival Corp;2014-05-12T18:16:05Z;Carnival joins race for cruise control in China;;The race to capture the growing Chinese market in cruises gathered steam after Carnival Corporation announced it was redeploying a European-based liner to Shanghai.Costa Serena, which carries 3,780 passengers, will be used all-year round from April 2015 in China, which Carnival said was the world’s fast-growing market and on its way to becoming the second biggest by 2017.It gives Carnival its fourth cruise ship in China and an increase in overall capacity in Asia of 74 per cent. Carnival has Costa Victoria and Costa Atlantica in China, and launches Sapphire Princess from its Princess Cruises brand later this month.The redeployment of Costa Serena intensifies competition for the Chinese market, following rival Royal Caribbean’s decision last month to redeploy the 4,180-passenger ship Quantum of the Seas to Asia.Royal Caribbean, the second biggest cruise operator behind Carnival, began sailing last summer from New Jersey to the Caribbean but will redeploy to Asia next season to run from Shanghai to Japan and Korea.Arnold Donald, Carnival chief executive, said the redeployment of Costa Serena was “of great strategic importance for our company”. He said Carnival would continue to work with Chinese government officials to help them establish the country as one of the most important cruise markets in the world.Carnival has 23 ships in Asia calling at 1,439 ports in 2014, 220 of them in China.The Chinese cruise market is relatively young, with Carnival opening its first season there in 2006. Cruises tend to be of shorter duration than those in other markets – the Costa Serena cruises are expected to last no more than five days – and passengers are younger than those in Europe and the US.Analysts say Carnival and Royal Caribbean will make strong on-board revenues on Chinese cruises from retail, gaming and fine wines, and can expect to increase the prices it charges for cruise tickets at a faster rate than in other markets.In a note, Wyn Ellis of Numis, said Asia was becoming “an encouraging new market” for Royal Caribbean, from which China was making up a third of its capacity in the region.“Despite a 30 per cent year-on-year capacity increase, yields [in China] are expected to grow in double-digits,” he wrote.Carnival shares, which have stuttered in the past 12 months as a result of reputational damage from the Costa Concordia disaster and a number of operational blunders, rose 1.2 per cent.
31;CCL;Carnival Corp;2013-12-20T15:20:49Z;Carnival cruises to recovery as bookings improve;;Carnival is showing signs of recovery after a miserable two years, as customers returned to the cruise operator’s flagship brand quicker than it had expected.Bookings improved throughout Carnival’s fourth quarter as the company launched a string of initiatives aimed at getting holiday makers back on its ships after a series of high-profile blunders and a fatal tragedy.“We are catching up on booking volumes and gaining momentum as we enter 2014,” said Arnold Donald, chief executive.Shares in the company have rallied more than 10 per cent in the past two days as the market reacted positively to news that customers were coming back to Carnival’s brand.Analysts said this was “very significant news”.“The key bear case for Carnival has been that this brand has been permanently damaged and cannot be turned round,” said Richard Carter, analyst at Deutsche Bank.Carnival had been buffeted by waves of negative publicity over the past two years. The January 2012 Costa Concordia tragedy– in which 32 people died – cast a shadow over the entire cruise industry.This was followed by other high profile, if far less disastrous incidents, such as 4,200 passengers left stranded in the Gulf of Mexico for four days earlier this year without any plumbing.Credit Suisse summed up the relief in the title of its note: “Something is finally going right for Carnival”.Bookings were ahead of the previous year – which proved to be an annus horribilis for the cruise industry following the Costa Concordia disaster, the worst accident in the industry’s modern history – although this was driven by heavy marketing and discounts.Total revenues were roughly flat for the 12 months to November 30 at $15.4bn. This resulted in profit before tax of $1.3bn – up by a fifth from the previous year.Mr Donald said: “With over 100 ships and more than 10m guests we have a scale advantage that cannot be replicated in this industry. We are aggressively seeking opportunities to leverage that scale to drive top-line improvement and gain cost efficiencies.”The company said diluted earnings for next year will be between $1.40 and $1.80. This is double the normal range, reflecting Carnival’s “uncertainty” about its margin due to rising costs, according to analysts at Panmure Gordon.Shares in Carnival were up 5 per cent at £24.28 on Friday afternoon.
32;CCL;Carnival Corp;2013-09-17T09:38:20Z;Wrecked Costa Concordia hauled upright;;Salvage workers are celebrating an unprecedented feat of engineering after hauling upright the partly submerged Costa Concordia cruise ship from the reef off Tuscany where it ran aground last year with the deaths of 32 passengers and crew.The complex 19-hour operation was completed at 4am local time. The 114,500 tonne ship, twice as heavy as the Titanic, was righted through 65 degrees by a system of jacks, cables and water-filled tanks, coming to rest in 30 metres of water on an artificial reef and underwater platforms sunk into the rocky bed.The successful conclusion to the operation, known as “parbuckling” in nautical terms, was celebrated with sirens blaring as an international engineering triumph. It contrasted with the scenes of chaos and humiliation felt by Italy when the ship’s captain wrecked and then abandoned his ship after a risky manoeuvre to steer it close to the island of Giglio on the night of January 13 2012.The engineering feat, the biggest salvage operation of its kind, was led by Titan Salvage, a Florida-based company, and Micoperi, an Italian group.“I think the whole team is proud of what they achieved. A lot of people said it couldn’t be done,” Nick Sloane, the salvage master from South Africa, told reporters as he came ashore from his floating command centre. “I feel good, it’s time for a beer,” he said.The cruise liner, as long as three football pitches, is owned by Costa Crociere, a unit of Carnival Corp of the US. Pier Luigi Foschi, chairman of Costa Crociere, said the successful operation was the fruit of public-private co-operation, and paid his respects to the families of the 32 passengers and crew among the 4,229 people on board who had lost their lives. Italy’s prime minister Enrico Letta sent his congratulations.The starboard side of the liner, crushed under its own weight while lying precariously on a granite reef, emerged slowly to reveal pancaked decks resembling a collapsed block of flats.The next stage of the operation, expected to take months, is to secure the ship before floating it and towing it away to the mainland port of Piombino for scrappage. The salvage organisers were fighting against time to raise and stabilise the ship before a third season of winter storms that could break it up.At more than €600m, the salvage operation is expected to be the most expensive maritime recovery. The Italian government has stressed that the public will not bear any of the costs, with the overall insurance loss estimated at more than $1.1bn. This figure could rise however if the government seeks compensation for damages to the seabed and marine life caused by the wreck in a maritime reserve.Two bodies have never been found and are believed to be somewhere in the wreckage. Many survivors jumped into the sea and swam ashore in the dark winter night.Captain Francesco Schettino is being tried for manslaughter and abandoning ship while many passengers and crew were still on board, and faces 20 years in prison if convicted. He maintains his innocence and says he saved lives by steering the ship closer to shore after it hit the reef. Five other defendants have sought plea-bargains.
33;CCL;Carnival Corp;2013-09-17T05:28:11Z;Crippled Costa Concordia pulled upright;;The crippled Costa Concordia cruise ship was pulled completely upright early on Tuesday after a complicated 19-hour operation to wrench it from its side where it capsized last year off Tuscany.Officials declared it a “perfect” end to a daring and unprecedented engineering feat.Shortly after 4am local time, the head of Italy’s Civil Protection agency, Franco Gabrielli, announced that the ship was vertical and the operation to rotate it – known in nautical terms as “parbuckling” – was complete.“We completed the parbuckling operation a few minutes ago the way we thought it would happen and the way we hoped it would happen,” said Franco Porcellacchia, project manager for the Concordia’s owner, Costa Crociere.The ship had been partially submerged for the past 20 months after it hit the rocks with the deaths of 32 passengers and crew.The parbuckling operation is the largest of its kind ever undertaken, with the ship measuring as long as three football pitches.Miami-based Titan Salvage and Micoperi, an Italian company, are leading the project, the world’s most expensive wreck removal operation, which is expected to cost more than €600m – greater than the value of the ship – once it is eventually floated and towed away for scrapping next year.A team of some 500 workers has been based on the small island off Tuscany for nearly a year to stabilise the wreck and prepare the salvage.The ship was pulled by dozens of steel chains weighing 17,000 tonnes, with tanks filled with water on the exposed side to help rotate it upwards. Engineers say this is the first time that such a parbuckling method has been applied to a cruise liner.Nick Sloane, Titan’s senior salvage master, said this was one of the most challenging operations he had undertaken in 30 years because of the size of the ship and the way it was resting on two reefs.“The objective will be to move slowly, gently and steadily,” he told reporters before the completion of the operation. “The operation cannot stop once it has started.“Time and weather are the worst enemies in this case, and we cannot afford to wait, she cannot go through another winter.”More than 30,000 tonnes of steel are being used to bring the cruise ship upright, more than four times the weight of metal in the Eiffel TowerContinue readingThirty-two people died when Captain Francesco Schettino took the vessel with 4,200 passengers and crew too close to Giglio’s rocky coastline on January 13 last year, slamming into a reef that tore a 70-metre gash in the hull. The severe listing of the ship as it came to rest on rocks prevented all lifeboats from being launched, and confusion surrounded evacuation orders.Two bodies have never been found and are believed to be somewhere in the wreckage. Many survivors jumped into the sea and swam ashore in the dark winter night.Capt Schettino is being tried for manslaughter and abandoning ship while many passengers and crew were still on board, and faces 20 years in prison if convicted. He maintains his innocence and says he saved lives by steering the ship closer to shore after it hit the reef. Five other defendants have sought plea-bargains.Experts appointed by the court have blamed the captain for the disaster but also concluded that the crew and Costa Crociere, the Italian subsidiary of Miami-based Carnival Corp and owner of the ship, committed mistakes and safety breaches.
34;CCL;Carnival Corp;2013-09-16T12:33:12Z;Command centre to raise Costa Concordia in three stages;;The remote controlled operation to bring the Costa Concordia cruise ship upright, known as “parbuckling”, is directed from a floating command centre and divided into three stages:● Freeing the hull from the two spurs of rocks where it has been resting for 20 months, with the hull having moulded itself around the reef. More than three hours into the operation the team said the ship was starting to move free.● Rotation continues with cables operated by strand jacks which gradually decrease their pull until sponsons – buoyancy chambers attached to the exposed port side – reach sea level and start to take in water. This occurs after the first 20 degrees of rotation.● The final phase using the sponsons, filled with seawater by remote controlled valves. The weight of the water will push the ship down so that, once righted, it rests on the artificial support of six steel underwater platforms at a depth of 30 metres.More than 30,000 tonnes of steel have been used in all components for the parbuckling and planned refloating – that is more than four times the weight of metal in the Eiffel Tower.The six platforms to take the weight of the ship measure in total some 150m in length, supported by 21 pillars with a diameter of 1.6m and buried on average 9m in the granite seabed. An artificial seabed was built to steady the ship with 1,180 grout bags weighing more than 16,000 tonnes.Fifty-six chains are used, each 58m long and weighing about 26 tonnes.The exposed port side of the ship is fitted with 11 steel buoyancy chambers. Seven vertical sponsons have the height of a seven-storey building. Two horizontal sponsons would measure 11 storeys. Ingress of water into the sponsons when they reach the sea will help the rotation process.Twenty months after it hit the rocks with the deaths of 32 passengers and crew, the Costa Concordia is once again the focus of media attention as salvage workers start the engineering feat of pulling the partially submerged cruise liner upright.The operation, known as “parbuckling”, is the largest of its kind ever undertaken, with the ship measuring as long as three football pitches and about seven times the size of the Titanic.Continue readingTwo blister tanks installed at the bow of the wreck provide buoyancy, measuring 23m long and 20m high. That structure weighs 1,700 tonnes.Twenty-two vessels and eight barges are involved. The biggest, called Lone, is 160m long.About 120 divers working on the project have made more than 15,000 dives.More than 500 people of 26 nationalities have worked on the project, including 70 welders, carpenters and fitters, 50 engineers and 10 biologists.The wreck is to be rotated 65 degrees to reach a vertical position.Among the stores trapped inside the hull were tonnes of cheese, ice-cream tubs, pasta, onions, raw meat and more than 10,000 eggs. Perhaps in better condition, workers may find 18,000 bottles of wine and 1,000 bottles of olive oil.
35;CCL;Carnival Corp;2013-06-26T16:48:48Z;New Carnival chief faces tough PR battle;;Asked for his assessment of the risks involved in taking a cruise, outgoing Carnival Corp chief executive Micky Arison said: “Your risk of driving to the port is a lot higher than anything you do once you get on the cruise. It’s probably true that the risk of getting in your shower is a lot higher too.”However small the risk, it has proved enough to prompt Mr Arison to hand over the chief executive reins of the world’s biggest cruise operator after 34 years in the post.One disaster has followed another since last year’s Costa Concordia tragedy, which claimed 32 lives when the vessel ran aground off the Italian coast. The company maintains the tragedy was the result of human error – “an unthinkable action by one individual”, according to Arnold Donald, Mr Arison’s chosen successor.But on top of lawsuits from relatives of the victims and survivors, and delays getting Concordia refloated and towed away, Carnival has faced other difficulties.Technical problems caused a cruise cancellation and a diversion in March. And a month earlier more than 3,000 passengers were left stranded in deteriorating sanitary conditions after an engine room fire on Carnival Triumph.Carnival complains these incidents get blown out of proportion, while problems suffered by other cruise operators go unnoticed.“Obviously people were terribly inconvenienced with what occurred,” Mr Donald said of the Triumph fiasco. “But that one got amplified, it got caught up by the media. The reality is it’s a terribly rare occurrence.”Cumulatively, the incidents are damaging Carnival’s revenues and profits. Carnival, which has a 45 per cent share of the cruise market, has slashed prices and is throwing $700m at repairs, but it has downgraded estimates for 2013 earnings per share. Revenues earned for each berth, known as net revenue yields, will be 2-3 per cent below last year.Consultants have warned Carnival it will take two to three years to recover its brand image. Mr Donald thinks that is unduly pessimistic.“We have 10m guests a year, 4m on Carnival alone. All of these people are sailing every week and having positive, joyful experiences. I’m very optimistic we will see [our brand image recover] in a shorter time period than that,” he said.Mr Donald is a Carnival board member of 12 years standing. He founded sweetener producer Merisant and held several posts at agricultural business Monsanto.Analysts grumble at Carnival’s decision to go in-house for Mr Arison’s successor. “The market would have been happier with a completely new broom,” said Wyn Ellis of Numis. “It looks a little bit too cosy.”However, with a promised marketing push, Carnival should recover some yield. Mr Ellis said yield had declined not just because of the incidents, but also because of increased capacity at a time of weak demand. Cruises, he added, compare well with other land-based leisure businesses in surveys on value for money.But for Karl Burns of Panmure Gordon, Carnival’s problems go a lot deeper. Like all cruise operators, its customer base is at or near retirement age, and more dependent on face-to-face contact with travel agents.“The problem is how the company can achieve any pricing power with so little controlled distribution,” Mr Burns said. “It becomes increasingly difficult, for example, to sell a high-value cabin to a customer.”New ships will help growth. But Mr Burns said: “The fact is the fleet is fairly old, so the return on capital is not going to improve any time soon, pricing isn’t moving anywhere and if anything costs are going up.”Mr Donald is unlikely to change much at Carnival. He talked about restoring staff morale, increasing return on invested capital, creating greater shareholder value and giving customers that joyful holiday experience.As for having Mr Arison stay on as chairman, Mr Donald said: “There are far worse back-seat drivers than Micky Arison. I feel very comfortable in terms of how we will operate together.”His first and probably biggest task is the PR battle – “how to help educate the media so that we take things in proper context”.The Triumph Carnival fiasco, and the reputational damage to the brand, showed that when it came to PR “we weren’t successful”, Mr Donald said.According to Mr Burns, the PR battle will only get harder. “Concordia was a dramatic event and it means that every minor event is blown up into sizeable proportions,” he said. “The industry is under the spotlight.”Off the Italian coast this week the last of six platforms, weighing 1,000 tonnes and measuring 32m in length, was put in place alongside the wreck of the Costa Concordia, 17 months after it capsized off the coast of the island of Giglio, writes Roger Blitz.The timetable for righting the ship is the end of the summer and, according to the Tuscan authorities, it should be ready for towing away next spring.Francesco Schettino, the captain of the ship on the night it ran aground, is due to stand trial next month on charges of manslaughter and abandoning ship.Cruise passenger numbers have been rising steadily each year from 2008 when they reached 16.3m, hitting 20.5m in 2011. But last year, following the Concordia disaster, they increased only 300,000 to 20.8m.“The cruise industry as a whole is heavily regulated under national and international law, maritime conventions and flag and port state laws,” said the trade body Cruise Lines International Association.“As an industry, we remain committed to continuous improvement when it comes to shipboard operations and safety.”
36;CCL;Carnival Corp;2013-06-25T15:41:07Z;Carnival chief executive steps down;;Micky Arison is stepping down as chief executive of cruise operator Carnival, following a series of technical problems with some of its ships and last year’s Costa Concordia disaster off the Italian coast.He will be replaced by Carnival board member Arnold Donald, the founder of sweetener producer Merisant, who was previously with Monsanto.Mr Arison, whose father Ted Arison co-founded Carnival Cruise Lines, will give up a post he has held since 1979, but retains the role of chairman.“I have been discussing this with the board for some time now and feel the timing is right to align our company with corporate governance best practices and turn over the reins after 34 years as CEO,” said Mr Arison, who also owns the Miami Heat basketball team.The reputation of the group, which operates 100 ships, carries 10m passengers a year and has a market capitalisation of $25.8bn, was seriously damaged when the Costa Concordia ran aground in January last year, claiming the lives of 32 people.A series of maritime problems this year hit bookings further, the worst in February when the Carnival Triumph drifted for four days in the Gulf of Mexico without power, leaving passengers in squalid conditions. It is having to spend $700m on upgrading its vessels.The cruise operator said cumulative advanced bookings and prices for the rest of 2013 were lower than last year’s levels.It is forecasting full-year net revenue yields – a measure of the revenue earned for each berth – down 2 to 3 per cent on last year, and full-year costs excluding fuel to be 3.5 to 4.5 per cent higher.Carnival, whose brands include Holland America, Cunard, Princess Cruises, Costa Cruises and P&O Cruises, maintained last month’s estimate that 2013 diluted earnings per share would be in the range of $1.45 to $1.65, compared with $1.88 in 2012.For the second quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.09, slightly ahead of the company’s guidance last month. Revenues for the quarter were $3.48bn, compared with $3.54bn in the same period last year.Net income was $41m, up from $14m a year ago because of lower fuel costs and the timing of administrative expenses.Wyn Ellis, Numis analyst, said: “Carnival has been negotiating stormy seas with sailing conditions aggravated by a series of very unfortunate incidents (arguably of its own making). Carnival would seem to be sailing into calmer waters and it is encouraging to have ‘steady as she goes’ results and outlook.”Shares were trading up 4.4 per cent to $34.67.
37;CCL;Carnival Corp;2013-05-22T19:34:37Z;Lombard: Marchant’s move leaves SSE successor to keep lights on;Chief times retirement fortuitously;Ian Marchant has timed his well-pensioned retirement from SSE fortuitously. Controversy comes with the territory when you are chief executive of a big energy company. For example, on Wednesday shadow energy minister Caroline Flint said SSE had increased full-year profits “on the back of spiralling bills for hard-pressed people”. But such formulaic disapproval may escalate into aggressive intervention if heating bills soar and power cuts impend in 2014-2017.According to Peter Atherton of Liberum, available generation could fall precariously to under 110 per cent of peak demand in 2016, compared with 140 per cent today. This would reflect three factors. First, closure of coal and oil-fired power stations to reduce pollution. Second, delays in getting mothballed gas-fired capacity, such as SSE’s plant at Keadby, North Lincolnshire, back on line. Third, installation of nuclear and wind generation at a rate slower than the government hopes for.The result would be a 20 per cent jump in heating bills and some very grumpy editorials in the Daily Mail. Even vote-grubbing politicians might balk at setting energy prices directly. But they could be tempted to resurrect the idea of a windfall tax, deterring private contributions to the £380bn of investment that the power sector is expected to need by 2030.SSE raised adjusted profits 5.6 per cent to £1.4bn and the dividend 5.1 per cent to 84.2p. Its promise to beat inflation with future payouts tempts fate. Income-hungry investors have been lured by a yield of 5 per cent, allowing the shares to keep up with the rampageous FTSE 100.A forward earnings ratio of 14 times makes the stock expensive, given the political risks. The task facing Alistair Phillips-Davies, Mr Marchant’s successor, is an unenviable one.Positive spinThe Competition Commission has acted as a centrifuge, writes Alison Smith. Well before it reveals its thoughts on the UK’s fizzy drinks industry, the very process of its inquiry has separated Irn-Bru from Tango, causing the planned all-share merger of AG Barr and Britvic to lapse. Now, even if regulators give it the green light, Britvic’s half-year results make it harder to reassemble the cocktail.Back in the autumn, the rationale for the often-discussed deal was that both Britvic (larger but weaker) and AG Barr (smaller but stronger) would benefit from their combined capacity and the ability to cut costs. Having worked on the merger plans, Britvic has concluded that the flat state of the market and some nifty rearrangements enable it to close two plants and a warehouse all by itself, with the prospect of £30m in annualised savings by 2016 – more than half of the synergies promised by the merger.There are two other causes of lumpiness in the blend. Under previous management, Britvic was happy to cede the chief executive slot to Roger White, Irn-Bru supremo. Simon Litherland is unlikely to be so relaxed. The ownership proportions may no longer work either: the £1.4bn group would have been 63 per cent owned by Britvic and 37 per cent owned by AG Barr, roughly reflecting relative market values. Their joint market value is now over £1.9bn, but after Wednesday’s 10 per cent rise in the Britvic share price, Britvic’s market cap is about 65 per cent of what the drinks combo would be worth. A new Barr-Britvic recipe will be harder to concoct.Miami virtuesCable & Wireless has been based in London for so long it’s a wonder no apocalyptic legend prohibits it from leaving, like the ravens of the Tower. That is a mercy for Tony Rice, impeccably British chief executive of C&W Communications, which demerged from ill-fated C&W Worldwide in 2010. He is relocating the headquarters of the international telecoms group to Miami, Florida, or near it.C&WC is thus set to join a select band of businesses based in the US but quoted in the UK. They include New York-based Virgin Media, which is being taken over, and dual-listed cruise line Carnival Corporation, another Miami resident.The official reason for the move is to bring C&WC executives closer to local operations in South America and the Caribbean. These will be the group’s main markets following the disposal of businesses in Macau and Europe.The pain of relocation should be eased for staff members by the thought that they will not have to endure another bone-chilling British spring. In Miami, only the beer is cold. How that will go down with Mr Rice, a connoisseur of trad pubs serving tepid ale, is anyone’s guess.jonathan.guthrie@ft.comBritvic: alison.smith@ft.com
38;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-09-13T16:00:35Z;Concordia operator denies alleged failings;;Costa Cruises has rejected any blame for the disaster involving the Concordia cruise liner, which sank off the coast of Tuscany in January.The Italian arm of the US’s Carnival Corporation that operated the Concordia on Thursday rejected allegations contained in court documents that it was late in declaring an emergency and failed to provide inadequate training for its on-board staff.In a statement, the company placed the blame on Francesco Schettino, the ship’s captain, “who made partial, tardy and confused [communications] to the [company’s] crisis department, not allowing it to gain a clear picture of the seriousness of what was actually happening”.Mr Schettino faces charges including negligent homicide, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship before the complete evacuation of the 4,200 passengers. He denies any wrongdoing.He is being investigated along with eight others, including three company officials. A court hearing to determine whether they should be put on trial is due to be held on October 15.“The law provides that in the event of the accident, the obligation to inform the authorities is the captain’s, while it is the duty of the company to put itself at the disposal of the authorities,” the operator’s statement said.According to legal documents – filed to the court on Tuesday and published by Italian media on Thursday – court-appointed experts mainly blamed Mr Schettino but also pointed the finger at the cruise operator for delays and security breaches that led to the deaths of 32 people.The 270 pages, drawn up by four mechanical and naval specialists, state that, although the company had sufficient information it “did not have the determination to [deal with] the situation”, delaying alerts to the coast guard authorities. In addition they blame Costa for delegating emergency drills to crew members who were not trained or certified.Costa Cruises on Thursday described the allegation that on-board staff were unprepared for emergencies as “groundless”.“The alleged defects in the certifications of some of the crew concern only a few individuals who are not key to emergency management,” the company statement said.Passengers have said they had little idea what was happening on the night the ship struck the rocks. Many complained of a confused and delayed evacuation process, suggesting that some crew members made decisions with no direction from the captain. Witnesses described difficulties in reaching the lifeboats, saying that some could not be lowered because of the listing of the boat.The operation to remove the wreck of the cruise liner started in June and is expected to last about 12 months. In August, Italian authorities said the work had been delayed and the ship was not expected to be towed away until the end of next spring, rather than by January as originally expected.
39;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-06-22T23:05:11Z;Carnival ‘catching up’ after disaster, says chief;;Carnival, operator of the world’s largest cruise ship fleet, is “catching up” after the bookings slowdown following January’s Costa Concordia disaster, according to its chief executive, but still expects net yields to be down on last year.Booking volumes for brands other than Costa, the brand whose ship capsized in the accident, were up 8 per cent over the previous year in the last seven weeks, according to Carnival. Volumes at Costa were up 25 per cent over the previous year.However, the company acknowledged that the revival in bookings had come partly as a result of reductions in ticket prices and that net revenue yields – a measure of the revenue earned for each berth – would be 3 to 4 per cent down.Carnival nevertheless increased its guidance for earnings per share for the full year to $1.80-$1.90, compared with $1.40-$1.70 in March. Carnival gives all such figures on a “non-GAAP basis,” excluding from the figures some of the technical gains and losses mandated under the US’s generally accepted accounting principles.“The increase in booking volumes indicates that a progressive recovery is well under way and we are catching up following the slowdown in bookings during wave season, our peak booking period,” said Micky Arison, chief executive.“The attractive pricing we have in the marketplace is clearly stimulating demand, especially for the Costa brand.”Bookings at the Costa brand fell by 80 to 90 per cent in the immediate aftermath of the capsizing of the Costa Concordia, which killed 32 people on January 13 after the vessel hit rocks off the Italian coast. Even at the company’s other brands, bookings were down in the “high single-digits” as recently as March.However, the company has insisted throughout that the bookings downturn was likely to be brief.Carnival’s non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $159m or $0.20 per share for the second quarter, against $206m or $0.26 per share for the second quarter of 2011. Revenue fell 2.8 per cent to $3.5bn.The expected fall in net yields would be partially offset, the company said, by greater-than-expected cost savings. Fuel costs aside, it expected costs per available lower berth day – a standard measure of capacity – to be down slightly on 2011.Fuel costs have not turned out to be as high as anticipated. The cost savings and lower-than-expected fuel price would together add $0.30 to full-year earnings per share, Carnival said.Carnival’s shares fell 1.2 per cent in London to £22.40. The company is listed in both London and New York.
40;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-05-18T18:16:09Z;Alarm delay ‘critical’ says Concordia probe;;The “main problem” investigators into the sinking of the Costa Concordia in January have found was that it took more than an hour after the cruise ship hit rocks for the ship’s emergency alarm to sound, officials involved said on Friday.The delay to the alarm’s sounding meant passengers started heading for their muster stations only 10 minutes before the giant cruise ship, with 4,229 people on board, came to rest on the seabed off the island of Giglio, investigators from the Italian Maritime Investigative Body said on Friday. This raises the possibility that many of the 32 lives lost in the accident, much the worst on a cruise ship in recent decades, could have been saved if the alarm had been sounded immediately.The investigators were presenting at the International Maritime Organisation in London the first results of their investigation into the grounding and capsizing of the vessel off Giglio on the night of January 13 this year.Elisa Giangrasso, an Italian coastguard officer, described to gasps from the audience how the vessel set a course to pass close to Giglio, strayed half a mile off course and then ran at speed into a shoal of rocks.The presentation came on the same day that salvage contractors outlined plans to start work this month on the “unprecedented” task of refloating the Concordia and removing its wreck.Ms Giangrasso called it the “critical point” of the investigation why, after the ship hit the rocks at 9.45pm, it took until 10.48pm for the captain to sound the alarm warning passengers to head towards lifeboat muster stations.The delay in sounding the alarm meant, according to Ms Giangrasso’s presentation, that far more of the ship was flooded by the time passengers started heading for the lifeboats than would have been the case earlier. The vessel remained stable as long as only two of its watertight compartments were flooded, she said. But, by 19 minutes after the grounding, there was water in four of the compartments and the ship was doomed.“The main problem that’s emerging from the investigation so far is linked to the delayed general emergency signal and the too short time between it and the abandon ship order,” Ms Giangrasso said.The abandon ship order was given only “a couple of minutes” after the general alarm’s sounding and the first lifeboat was launched at 10.55.The investigators – who have not yet had access to either members of the ship’s bridge team or the voyage data recorder recording events on board – offered no explanation for the delay. But they confirmed that Francesco Schettino, the captain, issued no immediate orders when informed 10 minutes after the grounding that two compartments in the hull had filled with water.“The ship’s master was informed directly about the flooding,” Ms Giangrasso said. “He gave no orders.”Costa Cruises, the arm of the US’s Carnival Corporation that operated the Concordia, Titan, a Florida-based salvage specialist, and Micoperi, an Italian marine contractor, said in a joint statement that work to remove the wreck would take about 12 months. The hull would be refloated and removed in one piece to minimise the work’s environmental impact, they said.
41;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-05-18T16:51:06Z;Carnival uses simulator to boost safety;;In a nondescript building on an industrial estate in Almere, the Netherlands, three Carnival Cruises officers on a replica ship’s bridge pretend they are facing a potential collision with another vessel.“I have stopped the starboard engine,” says Calum Sanders, third officer. “Stopped the starboard engine,” replies Captain Arigo.Mr Sanders and his colleagues are the latest in a steady stream of officers of Carnival Corporation, operator of the world’s biggest cruise ship fleet, to undergo training at the simulator, known as Csmart.Costa Cruises, one of Carnival’s subsidiaries, pledged on May 5 at the christening of the Costa Fascinosa, to make more use of the techniques taught at Csmart. The pledge was one of seven designed to enhance safety standards at the operator of the Costa Concordia, which capsized on January 13 off the Italian coast, killing at least 30 people and leaving two missing.Carnival declines to speculate on the tragedy’s cause, but it may have resulted from precisely the kind of lapse in bridge working practices Csmart was set up to prevent.Staff at the centre, which the cruise line opened in 2009, train officers in a new approach, intended to improve handling of the complex interactions between bridge personnel. A similar ship simulator, built mainly for Royal Caribbean Cruises, operator of the second-biggest cruise fleet, opened in Florida in March.Captain Arigo and his colleagues are being trained to explain their actions to each other clearly and deliberately. That should help rule out anyone planning a manoeuvre as risky as the one that took Francesco Schettino, the Concordia’s captain, on to the rocks off the island of Giglio on January 13.Alistair Clark, a senior captain for P&O Cruises, one of Carnival’s subsidiaries, says investigations of “numerous incidents” led the company to embark four years ago on the fresh approach to ship management.He rebuffs suggestions that the Concordia’s loss suggests that the methods have been found wanting, but declines to say whether Captain Schettino had attended Csmart courses.“We’re a company with 100 ships and many, many officers,” Captain Clark says. “When any change is introduced, it takes time to become second nature.”The revised management methods that Csmart teaches take the ship’s master out of direct, hands-on control. The principle, borrowed from the aviation industry, is that if the captain is in direct control it is unlikely that junior officers will challenge any mistakes. When he is monitoring, he can stand back and watch for junior officers’ errors and omissions.Captains say the course teaches them to become “proper, modern managers and leaders”, according to David Dingle, UK chief executive of Carnival.“I think each individual member of the bridge team feels that they play a more responsible role,” he says. “They’re recognised as being team members, that they’re being properly developed.”The risks are sufficiently serious for Captain Clark to have embarked on another programme borrowed from aviation. He and some other senior Carnival officers regularly visit ships’ bridges to report – omitting details such as the ship’s name – on how the lessons from Csmart are being applied.It is too early, Captain Clark says, to be sure of the programme’s results. But he insists such rigour is vital to driving safety standards up.“There has to be some sort of check or follow-up to ensure, firstly, that the system is operating as intended and, secondly, that it’s the best system we can have.”
42;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-04-23T20:27:48Z;Costa Cruises chief to stand down;;The chief executive of Costa Cruises, the Carnival Corporation subsidiary whose Costa Concordia cruise ship capsized in January killing at least 30 people, is to stand down in the biggest shake-up at the group since the tragedy.Carnival announced on Monday that Pier Luigi Foschi, who has worked for Costa since 1997, would retire from his post on July 1.Michael Thamm, president of Aida Cruises, based in Germany, would take over as chief executive of the Costa Group, which includes Aida and Ibero Cruises as well as the core Costa brand.Mr Foschi would remain chairman of the Costa Group and a director of Carnival Corporation, the company said.The company insisted, although it has never previously been announced, that Mr Foschi had long planned to step aside on turning 65. He reached that milestone in September last year.Mr Foschi would continue to oversee Costa’s government relations, matters related to the Concordia accident and “a number of strategic projects”, Carnival said.Micky Arison, Carnival’s chief executive, said the announcement was part of the company’s longtime succession plan, which allowed it to tap into its talented management team to find qualified individuals to oversee its brands.“Pier has developed Costa into a very successful and profitable organisation and we wish to thank him for his many years of dedicated service,” Mr Arison said.
43;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-04-22T14:09:55Z;Safety crackdown for cruise operators;;The European Commission and cruise operators are set this week to restrict access to ships’ bridges and tighten monitoring of watertight doors amid the most comprehensive revamp so far of passenger ship safety following January’s Costa Concordia tragedy.The new steps are designed to prevent some of the failings that appear to have led the Concordia, owned by a subsidiary of the US’s Carnival Corporation, to hit rocks off the Italian coast and capsize on January 13. The incident killed at least 30 people, while a further two remain missing.Siim Kallas, the EU transport commissioner, is expected to tell a passenger ship safety conference on Tuesday that the ultimate aim must be that, wherever a passenger boards a ship in the world, safety should be at “the highest possible level”.“Passengers should expect the same safety standards whether they are crossing on an overnight ferry from Sweden to Finland, or sailing from Malta to Sicily on a day trip,” he will say.The tightening up of safety announced at the conference will fall into two parts – three voluntary commitments from the European Cruise Council, the industry trade body, and two sets of instructions from the Commission to member states over inspections of ships in port.None of the steps is expected to involve significant cost.The cruise council is expected to propose closer monitoring of access to ships’ bridges to ensure that unnecessary visitors are excluded.The trade body is also likely to commit itself to undertaking more rigorous pre-planning of vessels’ routes and monitoring of whether they have been followed.Access to bridges has emerged as a key issue after it emerged that Francesco Schettino, the Concordia’s captain, had invited Domnica Cemortan, a young Moldovan tour operator, on to the ship’s bridge before it ran aground.A tightening of route planning and monitoring is aimed at ensuring vessels are less likely in future to undertake the kind of highly dangerous manoeuvre that led the Concordia to hit rocks in shallow water.It is also proposed that vessels should also in future carry more life jackets in more positions around the vessel, to reduce the time and walking involved in finding a life jacket.The Commission will ask member states to check more closely on vessels' procedures for recording who is on board, after substantial initial confusion about who was on board the Concordia.It will also ask them to pay more attention to the use of watertight doors in ship bulkheads, to ensure they are opened only when strictly necessary. The step should improve the chances of containing any influx of water when a hull is breached.International cruise organisations moved immediately after the Concordia disaster to ensure passengers had to hold “muster drills” to practise evacuation before ships departed. Passengers that embarked at Civittavecchia the night before the Concordia disaster had not performed the safety drill, though those who came a board earlier had done it.A person involved indicated the Commission’s account of the cruise industry’s commitments was broadly correct. The cruise council declined to comment.
44;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-04-20T19:23:18Z;Royal Caribbean projects sharp profit fall;;Second-quarter profits at Royal Caribbean Cruises are likely to fall to little better than break-even as the world’s second-largest cruise operator by revenues suffers lower yield growth and slower-than-expected bookings following January’s Costa Concordia disaster.The company, whose brands include Celebrity Cruises, Pullmantur and Royal Caribbean International, projected the sharp fall on Friday as it announced first-quarter net income down 40 per cent in 2011 to $47m. The profit figure, at 21 cents a share, nevertheless beat guidance of 10 to 20 cents a share.However, the company insisted that the fall-off in bookings following the capsizing of the Costa Concordia – which was operated by an arm of rival Carnival Corp, the biggest operator by revenues – was tailing off. Bookings, which had been down up to 20 per cent year on year immediately after the accident, were now down in the “mid-single digits”, the company said.The shares fell 4.57 per cent to $27.55 in early trading.Richard Fain, chief executive, said the first-quarter results had been “satisfactory given the difficult and uncertain operating environment”.“We did not expect the impact of the tragedy to be long term and we are seeing evidence the effects are waning,” Mr Fain said.The Concordia disaster, in which 30 people died after the vessel hit rocks off the Italian coast on January 13, is likely to hit the middle half of the year particularly seriously because holidays in those periods are normally booked during the January period when publicity over the accident was most intense.Second-quarter per share figures were likely to fall into a range between losses of 5 cents a share and 5 cents in earnings, against net income of $93.5m, or 43 cents a share, last year, the company said. It trimmed its guidance for full-year earnings per share – which had been $1.90-$2.30 – to $1.80-$2.20.The third quarter is likely to see a still more significant effect on yield-per-passenger than the second because Europe accounts for 54 per cent of the itineraries that Royal Caribbean offers in the third quarter, against 32 per cent in the second. The Concordia accident has affected bookings in Europe far more than in Royal Caribbean’s core North American market.Brian Rice, chief financial officer, said the company remained confident there would be yield improvements in both the second and fourth quarters. It forecasts second-quarter yields 2 to 3 per cent better than last year’s.But Mr Rice added: “There’s still a wide range of outcomes for Q3.”The company made no comments in the release on any effect from an incident on March 31 on its luxury cruise ship Azamara Quest, which had to cut short its journey and head to Malaysia after an engine room fire briefly crippled it. Five crew members were injured.
45;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-04-19T21:10:59Z;Concordia salvage award expected;;The contract for one of the most challenging and costly salvage operations ever mounted is expected to be awarded this weekend as Italian officials and insurance companies select the winner of a tender to recover the Costa Concordia cruise liner, which sank off Tuscany in January.Italian admirals and government officials met in London on Thursday with London Offshore Consultants (LOC) to consider a bid by Florida-based Titan Salvage together with Italy’s Micoperi, industry sources said. They expected a formal statement on Friday awarding the contract to the US-Italian joint venture.LOC, appointed as consultants in the tender process, did not respond to requests for comment. Costa Cruises, the Italian operator of the ship and a subsidiary of Carnival Corp, said the winner of the salvage contract would be announced “shortly”, but it had not fixed a date. It had previously said it expected to make a decision in late March.The US-Italian joint venture is competing against Smit, the salvage unit of Boskalis, the Dutch maritime services company, in partnership with Italy’s Neri. The two groups were shortlisted out of six companies that submitted bids.Both proposals involve floating the wreck and towing it away, rather than cutting it up where it rests, half-submerged, in a marine sanctuary off the island of Giglio. The ship, with some 4,200 passengers and crew, went down on January 13 with the loss of 32 lives after it hit shoals close to the island. Its captain is under arrest.Industry sources expect the operation to cost from €250m-€280m and that it could take a year.Costa Cruises said it would make a joint decision on the salvage contract with its insurers, with the approval of the Italian authorities.Having declared to insurers a total loss of the ship, Costa Cruises said it no longer owned the Concordia but maintained “judicial custody”.A 13-deck resort as long as three football pitches and with a gross tonnage of 114,000 tonnes – more than twice that of the Titanic – the Concordia’s sheer size presents problems. It rests precariously on its side on two rocky pinnacles, close to deeper waters. Italian authorities stress their main concern is the local environment and Giglio’s tourism-based economy.The Titan Salvage-Micoperi proposal involves constructing an underwater platform which would support the wreck after it is rotated and partially raised from the seabed using tanks. Once the hull is repaired it would be floated.Posidonia, a protected species of seagrass, would be removed from the salvage site and replanted in its original place once the platform pylons are removed after the operation. A protective casing around drilling for the pylons would shield seafans and sponges.“This is an operation without precedent. You have to imagine a big fat whale the size of a block of flats lying on its side, accidentally supported by two rocks,” Peter Berdowski, chief executive of Boskalis, told reporters last month. Smit, the subsidiary, and Neri have emptied the Costa Concordia of its fuel and are clearing up debris from the seabed.
46;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-03-31T16:27:06Z;Crippled cruise ship heads for Malaysia;Engine fire hits Azamara Quest;Engineers on board a luxury cruise ship adrift off the Philippines restored power late on Saturday after a fire that injured five crew members, one seriously, in the third significant safety incident for the fast-growing cruise industry this year.After the restoration of power, the Azamara Quest was steaming slowly towards the Malaysian port of Sandakan, Azamara Club Cruises, the vessel’s operator, said. The vessel was expected to reach the port within 24 to 48 hours, Azamara, a subsidiary of Royal Caribbean Cruises, added.The fire, which broke out on Friday evening local time, follows the capsizing on January 13 off the coast of Italy of the Costa Concordia, which killed at least 30 people and left another two missing. Another vessel operated by Costa Cruises, the Costa Allegra, suffered a crippling fire on February 27 near the Seychelles and had to be towed to port. Costa is a subsidiary of Miami-based Carnival Corporation, the largest cruise line by revenues. Royal Caribbean is number two in the market.The Quest was on a cruise that had left Hong Kong on Monday for a 17-night voyage due to visit the Philippines and parts of the Indonesian archipelago before ending in Singapore. It is one of two vessels operating under Royal Caribbean’s Azamara Club Cruises brand, which specialises in high-end cruises offering passengers longer stays in port and more exotic itineraries.Royal Caribbean has been particularly successful in expanding into the Asian market, which all cruise lines see as potentially vast.The five injured members of the 419-strong crew all suffered smoke inhalation while fighting the engine room fire, which Azamara said had been brief and quickly extinguished. The condition of the worst-affected crew member had improved but was still serious, the company said. He would need hospital treatment on land.None of the 617 passengers on board was injured but they were called to their lifeboat muster stations, in case it became necessary to abandon ship.The Cruise Lines International Association, the industry’s umbrella body, insists despite the recent rash of incidents that cruising enjoys a good safety record. There was a total of only 28 passenger or crew fatalities on cruise ships resulting from a maritime incident in the decade before the Costa Concordia’s grounding, it says.Richard Fain, Royal Caribbean’s chief executive, two weeks ago gave the Financial Times the first major interview by a senior cruise line executive since the Costa Concordia accident. He insisted that the new generation of big ships, whose safety has come under attack following the Concordia accident, were safe and could be evacuated even faster than smaller vessels.
47;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-03-18T20:06:17Z;Wall St braced for hit to soaring markets;;US corporations’ quarterly earnings are set to register their first decline in more than two years, in what will be a challenge to the stock market’s stellar start to 2012.The S&P 500 last week rose above 1,400– a level not seen since June 2008. It has gained more than 11 per cent this year.That run has coincided with solid earnings reports for the last quarter of 2011. But rising commodity prices, notably oil, are compressing profit margins for many companies, including Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo and Carnival Corporation.In turn, Wall Street analysts are turning increasingly bearish, with analysts forecasting S&P 500 first-quarter earnings will come in 0.5 per cent lower than the first quarter of 2011, the first fall since the third quarter of 2009.That sets the stage for a volatile period for stocks when the earnings season begins next month. “A messy earnings season is likely to grab investor attention and could weigh on stocks,” said Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.Expectations for earnings have been steadily scaled back this year, as the mood among companies has worsened. Profit warnings have outpaced positive guidance by three to one, while more companies than usual have offered no guidance at all.PepsiCo forecast a “high single-digits decline” in first-quarter earnings on a recent conference call with analysts, blaming commodity price inflation. Cruise ship operator Carnival said its fuel bill for the quarter would be $137m higher than in the same period last year.Companies have also warned about a slowdown in emerging market growth, and the impact of a strong dollar on margins.Analysts tracked by data research company FactSet are expecting S&P 500 companies to report $225.8bn in first-quarter earnings, down $1bn.Revenue is expected to grow 3.5 per cent but margins to fall for the first time in two years.The bearish turn comes just as analysts globally turn positive on corporate prospects: the first week of March saw earnings upgrades outpace downgrades for the first time in almost a year, according to Citigroup.Investors are divided as to how a poor earnings season would affect US stocks.“The current rally is all about confidence and the retreat of headline eurozone risk,” said Jim Paulsen, chief market strategist at Wells Capital.“The market still hasn’t priced in record-breaking earnings from last year, so a blip in growth should not matter.But Mr Knapp said: “If earnings do disappoint, investors are unlikely to take comfort in past performance.”
48;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-03-18T19:10:04Z;Cruise industry charts new territories;;It is easy watching the vast cruise ships slipping into and out of the berths near Richard Fain’s office in the Port of Miami to understand the public shock at January 13’s Costa Concordia accident. The vessels move so serenely and apparently effortlessly it is impossible to imagine a voyage ending amid the panic and confusion that survivors of January’s tragedy describe.Since January 13, Mr Fain, chief executive of Royal Caribbean Cruises, has spent much of his time handling the consequences of the public’s sudden recognition of the potential – albeit tiny – for a cruise holiday to end in such a tragedy.While the Costa Concordia belonged to a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation, Royal Caribbean’s neighbour in Miami, Royal Caribbean also suffered a marked slowdown in bookings in the key “wave” period of January when many annual cruise holidays are booked. It has also had to reassure the public further about the stringent safety measures it takes.However, speaking to Mr Fain in his fifth-floor office overlooking the water, it is clear that Royal Caribbean was facing up to a whole range of strategic challenges even before the Concordia hit the rocks. The company is slowing down its fleet expansion as it seeks to improve profitability. It is also pushing fast into emerging markets where profits – for the moment – are lower but, Mr Fain calculates, business long-term is likely to be brisk.Yet sitting on the edge of his deep, plush seat, Mr Fain stresses in the accent of his native Boston his eagerness to tackle safety questions.“It’s so central to our success as a company and as an industry that it’s a very appropriate topic of conversation,” he says. “I also think that the whole subject is not just a question of numbers and technology and procedures. It’s also a question of culture and consciousness. Safety should be a habit.”As well as defending the safety of his company’s large ship designs, Mr Fain, 64, says his company always seeks to find out from instances of human error what lessons there are to be learnt. Many observers believe the Costa Concordia incident will turn out to have been predominantly a result of mistakes by the vessel’s captain.“There are steps we have taken – very powerful steps – to protect our passengers and our crew from human error,” Mr Fain says. “But we can always learn if there are things we can do even better.”Yet, had it not been for the accident, the most pressing questions around Royal Caribbean would probably have concerned its drive for greater profitability. Net profits for 2011 were $607m, up 18 per cent on the year before, on revenue up 10 per cent to $7.5bn. But Mr Fain acknowledges that, after an investment splurge in recent years, the time has come to improve yields. Like other cruise companies, Royal Caribbean is consequently slowing down new ship orders.“One of the attractions of cruising is that it’s such good value for money,” Mr Fain says. “I anticipate that will continue – but I would like it to be a little less good value for money.”A straightforward push for profitability, however, might not immediately fit with Mr Fain’s other strategic priority – to move more of the business that Royal Caribbean’s 40 ships do beyond the company’s traditional markets around the US.When he joined as chief executive in 1988, Mr Fain says, 90 per cent of the company’s cruises left from within 100 metres of his Miami office. This year, more than 50 per cent of the company’s passengers will come from outside the US. Royal Caribbean has been particularly assiduous in trying to convert the Chinese market to the joys of cruising.Chinese guests, however, for the moment spend less on board than the American baby boomers who are Royal Caribbean’s core market. There are also costs in setting up the office and sales infrastructure to serve them.But, however the different world markets develop, Mr Fain suggests, the company will have a range of choices about where best to focus its efforts.“One of the great benefits of the cruise industry is that our assets are moveable,” Mr Fain says.The key will be to calculate the best trade-off between the areas offering the highest yields and the cost of doing business in those areas.“It’s a constant balance of those requirements,” Mr Fain says.
49;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-03-18T18:42:09Z;Royal Caribbean chief says big ships safe;;The chief executive of Royal Caribbean Cruises has defended the use of big ships, claiming that they are safer and more popular with holidaymakers than the smaller older vessels.Richard Fain, whose company sails the world’s biggest cruise liners, said evacuation was faster from large ships in emergencies such as the recent capsizing of the Costa Concordia because of the greater number of entrances and exits built into their bodies.“The truth is that the newer, bigger ships are as safe or safer than any comparable smaller ships,” he said.The Concordia, operated by a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation, was carrying 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew when disaster struck. Commentators were quick to suggest that the problems of quickly evacuating the vessel made the ships fundamentally dangerous.Royal Caribbean’s Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas are much larger than the Concordia, each carrying 5,400 passengers and just short of 2,400 crew.Mr Fain claimed that they were not only safer, but a more pleasant way to travel because the money saved from the economies of scale could be spent on improving onboard facilities.Royal Caribbean’s bigger ships tended to earn higher guest satisfaction scores and higher spend per passenger, he added.Mr Fain acknowledged that big ships would never be suited to every market. Royal Caribbean’s second-highest satisfaction ratings and yields were on the 92-berth Celebrity Xpedition, the group’s smallest ship.Royal Caribbean, the second-biggest cruise operator by revenues, said in February that its North American bookings had fallen in the “low to mid teens” following the Concordia accident and by more in Europe.Carnival, the market leader, said earlier this month that it expected full-year net revenue yields down 2 to 4 per cent over last year as a result of the accident.
50;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-03-16T17:29:08Z;Cruise sector upbeat amid push on safety;;The cruise shipping industry was in surprisingly optimistic mood this week for the first Cruise Shipping Miami conference since the Costa Concordia accident.The ship hit rocks on January 13 off the Italian coast and capsized, killing 25 people and leaving seven missing.January’s incident – and discussion about how to improve safety and persuade the public the industry is fundamentally safe – overshadowed the exhibition and conference, the biggest annual get-together for an industry whose passenger numbers have more than doubled since 2000.Some of the industry’s leading companies, such as Royal Caribbean Cruises, the second-largest operator by revenues, were at pains to show off their investment in the latest safety equipment, including the world’s most advanced ship simulator, built for Royal Caribbean in Fort Lauderdale.However, participants in the industry’s central “State of the Industry” session on Tuesday mostly predicted continuing growth in traffic and the amounts passengers were prepared to pay to go on cruises.Gerald Cahill, chief executive of Carnival Cruise Lines, the largest single brand of Carnival Corp, the biggest group by revenues, told the conference he anticipated taking more bookings at higher prices than last year. Carnival is the parent of Costa Cruises, the Costa Concordia’s owner.“It hasn’t been as good as it would have been without the accident,” Mr Cahill said. “But my forecast shows an increase in revenue for the year. I think the industry will weather this.”Even without the Concordia incident, the industry faced a turning point as operators row back on recent years’ breakneck growth to try to improve yields. Many are also trying to diversify into emerging markets, such as China, another key talking point of the conference.
51;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-03-15T16:52:40Z;Ship simulator highlights teamwork;;"The ship’s bridge enjoys a commanding view over the channel leading out of the Port of Miami. On the right, queued along one quay, are four of the world’s largest cruise ships. In the captain’s eyeline, the sun is rising behind Miami Beach’s apartment blocks, making navigation more difficult.The scene on the bridge, however, unfolds not in Miami, the world’s busiest cruise port, but 25 miles to the north in Fort Lauderdale, in a simulator that Resolve Marine Group, its operator, claims is the world’s most sophisticated for ships. At the flick of a switch, the scene switches to the approaches to the busy waters of New York harbour.The facility was planned long before January 13, when the Costa Concordia ran aground and capsized off the Italian coast. At least 25 people died and seven are missing.But the world’s biggest cruise shipping lines are now eager to highlight the role of such facilities and crew training programmes as they seek to protect their substantial businesses from further damage as a result of the accident, which sent booking levels down sharply.The $6.5m simulator, due to open fully next month, has been built primarily to meet the needs of Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, the world’s second-largest cruise operator by revenues, to train its crew not only in ship technology but also how to work together.The facility may prove particularly relevant if investigations of the Concordia incident focus heavily on the culture of the ship’s bridge. Modern vessel management procedures should encourage officers to query and seek to rectify navigational mistakes, such as those that apparently led Francesco Schettino, the vessel’s captain, to put the ship on to rocks off the island of Giglio.The industry’s efforts to underline its safety record have vocal backing in the region. Bill Johnson, director of the Port of Miami, which handled 4.1m passengers last year, says there is probably no other industry with a safety record as good as the cruise industry’s.“This is a difficult moment right now, but I think the impact is just momentary,” he says.Carnival Corp, the largest cruise line by revenues and parent of Costa Cruises, the Concordia’s operator, has its headquarters in Miami, as does Royal Caribbean.The simulator’s most important new capability, according to Joseph Farrell, Resolve Marine’s founder and chief executive, is that it allows several different bridge teams to operate different vessels simultaneously in one simulation. This forces the crew to face up to the unpredictability of other vessels’ reaction to difficult weather or other events at sea.Resolve can rerun the simulations afterwards with course attendees to probe their actions, Mr Farrell says. “We can assess with an attendee, ‘Why did you make that decision?’,” he says.That capability will help Royal Caribbean to underline for officers the importance of working together as a single team, says Bill Wright, senior vice-president for marine operations of Royal Caribbean International, one of Royal Caribbean’s brands. Royal Caribbean has been working on problems of bridge communications since the mid-1990s, he says.“We’ve been encouraging not only our captains but our senior officers to be accepting that we all make errors; we’re all human beings,” he says.Everybody should feel empowered to speak up and raise a concern, he says. The simulator is particularly useful because it feels so realistic.Mr Johnson’s concern is that the efforts by Royal Caribbean, Carnival and other big cruise lines to promote their safety record might not be enough to avert damage to the south Florida economy.As well as the Port of Miami, the region’s Port Everglades, next to the Resolve facility, last year handled another 3.6m passengers, making it the world’s second-busiest cruise facility.Mr Johnson fears excessive regulation in the wake of the Concordia accident could stifle some of that activity. “We’re concerned about overreaction,” he says. “This is a very heavily regulated industry. I wouldn’t want anyone to think there are issues.”Yet, for one business in the region at least, the prospect of a greater emphasis on safety has its upside.Mr Farrell says that, in addition to the nearly complete simulator, he is seeking more space to expand the training side of his business, which mainly offers salvage services.“We’re negotiating for significant space in that building over there,” Mr Farrell says, gesturing to outside the window. “You can probably guess that’s a result of the incident in Italy.”"
52;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-03-14T20:34:32Z;Shipyards likely to seek Chinese partners;;Europe’s shipyards are likely to form joint ventures with Chinese yards to construct cruise ships tailored to the local market, the chairman of the world’s largest cruise ship builder has predicted as the sector faces growing Asian competition.Corrado Antonini, chairman of Italy’s state-owned Fincantieri, was speaking at Cruise Shipping Miami, the biggest annual gathering for the cruise shipping industry. Cruise ship building is the last area where European shipbuilders enjoy a world-leading position. Since 1990 Fincantieri alone has been responsible for 35 per cent of the cruise ship capacity delivered worldwide.Cruise shipping is growing rapidly in emerging markets such as Brazil and China, raising the question of whether cruise ship building might also migrate to Asia. China is by some measures now the world’s biggest power in commercial shipbuilding, followed by Korea and Japan.However, Mr Antonini insisted European shipbuilders would have a strong future.“My shipyard, Fincantieri, the market leader for many years, will continue to stand at the forefront of technological advances,” Mr Antonini said.Conference participants agreed that most Asian shipyards would struggle to meet the cruise shipping lines’ need for highly individualised ships. Asian yards are geared predominantly to meeting commercial shipowners’ needs for large numbers of identical ships.Mike Kaczmarek, vice-president for corporate shipbuilding of Carnival Corp, the largest cruise ship operator by revenues, said that, because of their strengths in several areas, the majority of qualified cruise ship builders continued to be European.“The balance of most of those areas will still remain, I think, for the near term at least in Europe,” he said.However, Carnival’s Aida brand last year placed two orders – the first for many years at an Asian yard – with Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.“The re-emergence of Mitsubishi on to the market is, from an owner’s perspective, a good sign,” Mr Kaczmarek said. “It’s created additional competition.”Mr Antonini predicted that Chinese yards would need, at least at first, European partners to master cruise ship building techniques.“There will come the moment, sooner or later, where the Chinese shipbuilders will think in terms of a Chinese product that’s tailored to the specific needs of the Chinese passengers,” he said.However, Mr Antonini said building a cruise ship was a “complex endeavour”.“In my opinion, in the beginning there will be some kind of getting together between Chinese operators and experienced shipyards to find a way of adjusting the product to the Chinese requirements,” he said.Fincantieri built the Costa Concordia, which capsized on January 13 off the Italian coast, leaving 25 confirmed dead and seven missing. Mr Antonini declined to discuss the specifics of the accident. However, referring to the industry’s generally strong safety record, he said the latest, stringent rules would make new ships even safer.
53;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-03-11T19:05:57Z;Carnival: leaking bookings;Two incidents in one month have scared many potential investors;The capsizing of the Costa Concordia and the fire aboard the Costa Allegra would have been expected to hit cruise operator Carnival’s first-quarter results. And so they did, but not by much. In total, only $63m relating to the two incidents was expensed. Carnival used the events, however, as a good excuse to clean out the balance sheet. Some $173m of goodwill and trademarks relating to Ibero Cruises, the company’s Spanish brand, were written off. Altogether, a profit of 19 cents per share in the first quarter of last year turned into an 18 cents per share loss this time.Excluding what are hopefully one-offs, investors could be forgiven for thinking that things are not that bad at Carnival. Its ships carried 4 per cent more passengers and generated 5 per cent more revenue in the last quarter than they did in the previous year. But there are reasons to worry. One is fuel prices, which rose by almost one-third in the quarter and now comprise 16 per cent of the company’s cost base – 2 percentage points higher than last year.Another is Carnival’s confusing response to the Costa incidents. It says that despite a “significant” drop in Costa bookings it will not discount tickets to lure back passengers. It says that this is “to maintain an orderly market”. But the hope that people will just return appears over-optimistic. Since the accidents Costa has all but ceased advertising, and even excluding Costa, Carnival’s advance bookings for 2012 are 3 percentage points lower than last year.Carnival’s shares have lost 13 per cent since the Concordia incident in January. With many costs uncertain and the company facing potential legal action, its current valuation of 16 times 2012 earnings looks rich, particularly as its five-year average multiple is about 13. Statistically, cruising is a relatively safe holiday, but two incidents in one month have scared many potential passengers. Investors may wish to stay away too.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
54;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-03-09T19:26:52Z;Costa bookings fall after Concordia disaster;;Bookings at Costa Cruises, the Carnival Corporation brand that owns the capsized Costa Concordia, fell 80 to 90 per cent on the previous year in the immediate aftermath of January 13’s fatal accident and could take a year to recover, the parent company has said.Howard Franks, Carnival Corporation’s chief operating officer, gave the figures as the company announced net income was down 91 per cent to $13m for the three months to the end of February, on revenue up 4.8 per cent to $3.58bn. The company excluded from its profit figure a $173m write-off for the value of its Ibero Cruises brand and net unrealised gains on fuel derivatives of $21m.Bookings at Costa remained 40 to 50 per cent down on 2011, Mr Franks added. Figures at Carnival’s other brands, which include Cunard, Aida Cruises and P&O Cruises, were down on last year in the “high single-digits” and the company expected full-year earnings to be as little as half the level it expected before the Concordia accident.The company expected Costa’s bookings to improve gradually over the year. But Mr Franks added: “Estimates are that it will take up to a year for bookings to recover to previous levels.”However, he insisted the company would persevere with the brand, despite the Concordia incident and the further bad publicity last month when its Costa Allegra liner lost power after a fire off the Seychelles and had to be towed for two days to the islands’ capital.“There should be no doubt we view Costa as a great company and a great brand with a terrific management team and a great future,” Mr Franks said.The first-quarter figures included a $29m charge for the costs of the Concordia disaster and another $34m relating to the Allegra. Full-year net revenue yields would be flat compared with 2011 at brands excluding Costa and 2 to 4 per cent down including it.The effect would be full-year net earnings per share between $1.40 and $1.70, against $2.42 for 2011 and the $2.55 to $2.85 expected for 2012 before the Concordia incident.That accident was by far the worst in years in the cruise industry. Both Carnival, the biggest cruise operator by revenue, and Royal Caribbean Cruises, the number two, reported in the weeks after the accident that worldwide bookings were down by about 15 per cent.However, Robin Farley, an analyst at UBS, said the impact on Carnival was not as bad as feared.Carnival’s shares, which are traded in London and New York, fell 9p in London to £19.19.
55;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-03-06T22:15:42Z;Costa crew facing alleged settlement pressure;;Crew members who survived the deadly wreck of the Costa Concordia cruise ship in January have felt pressure to accept cash settlements quickly in order to return to their jobs, lawyers advising on possible claims against the ship’s owners have told the Financial Times.Costa Crociere, the Carnival subsidiary that operated the Concordia, and Cruise Ships Catering International, a subsidiary that hired food and beverage workers, have offered crew members a payout for losses that also requires them to forfeit their right to claim psychological and physical distress from the wreck.According to a copy of the settlement contract seen by the FT, the offer would cover personal money lost on board, personal items lost – up to a maximum of $3,750 – and pay for the remainder of their contracts.“Most of the ones who have signed did not have the opportunity to review the terms or have the assistance of counsel,” says Monica Kelly, who represents crew member Gary Lobaton. Mr Lobaton has filed a suit in Chicago federal court against Carnival Corp and seeks class-action status to represent Concordia victims, crew and passengers. The suit seeks compensation for alleged breach of contract, negligence and unjust enrichment as well as punitive damages.Ms Kelly, of Ribbeck Law, said some crew in Indonesia reported being told that if they hired a lawyer, they might no longer be rehired. “Our strategy is to challenge the validity of the release,’’ she said. She said she was planning to file further individual suits for crew members.Costa Cruises and Cruise Ships Catering International said no crew were under pressure to accept a settlement. “On the contrary, we’re receiving requests from the majority of them to shortly return onboard our ships,’’ Costa Crociere said in a statement.A statement from the company said that “issues relating to settlements are private between Costa, its customers, and crew”. No one from Costa had threatened or pressurised any member of crew, who were being treated fairly, the company said.The company declined to say whether any crew who had not signed the release had been rehired and whether they had received their compensation.More than 4,200 people were aboard when the ship hit rocks off the coast of Italy. Thirty-two people are reported dead or still missing.One Indonesian crew member from the Concordia spoke to the FT on condition of anonymity and said he signed papers from the company but was not sure what he had agreed to. “My monthly salary of about $600 is a lot of money. I have to go back to work. But I am still traumatised.”Marc Bern, a lawyer who has joined with Italian consumer association Codacons in pursuing negligence claims against Carnival in the US for at least $528m in damages, said his firm had been retained by about a dozen crew.“These are individuals with some limited skill and are intimidated by a multi-million dollar multinational corporation. It’s David vs Goliath,’’ said Mr Bern, a senior partner at Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik.Additional reporting by Giulia Segretti in Rome
56;CCL;Carnival Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Costa Concordia experts set July deadline;;Court-appointed experts have until July 21 to complete investigations into the Costa Concordia ‘s “black box” voyage data recorder, which should reveal vital information on what happened on the night of January 13 when the cruise liner hit rocks and sank off the coast of Tuscany.Valeria Montesarchio, a judge, set the deadline at a pre-trial hearing in the town of Grosseto on Saturday, which was attended by survivors and lawyers. Despite Italy’s reputation as a country where trials take many years to conclude, lawyers emerging from the closed-door hearing – held in a theatre to accommodate the large numbers involved – were encouraged that the judge and prosecution wanted to press ahead.“We will close the investigation right after the summer. Thirty-two deaths are asking for justice,” commented Francesco Verusio, the state prosecutor leading the criminal investigation. Lawyers said they hoped this stage of pre-trial proceedings would conclude before the end of the year.Ms Montesarchio rejected bids by various groups, including environmental and consumer protection associations, to be involved in proceedings as “damaged parties”. However, all layers of government, from the centre down to the local council on the island of Giglio, off which the ship sank, will be represented.Six officers are under investigation, including Francesco Schettino, the ship’s captain, who is under house arrest and was represented at the hearing by his lawyer. He faces charges including negligent homicide, causing a shipwreck and abandoning his ship before the evacuation of its 4,200 passengers and crew was completed.Three officials of Costa Cruises, the ship’s Italian operator, are under investigation.Some lawyers for victims of the disaster said they would start separate civil proceedings against Costa Cruises in Genoa, where the company is registered.Marco Bona, a lawyer representing the families of two dead crew members, from Peru and India, said they had decided to sue for damages in Italy rather than in the US, where Carnival Corp, the parent company, is based. Mr Bona said that, under the principle of “forum non conveniens”, a US court would be highly likely to refer the case back to Italy.“Something was completely wrong with the safety management and training of employees. The problem was not just the ship hitting the rocks. The entire system failed,” Mr Bona told the FT.Costa Cruises has blamed the disaster on the captain and offered compensation to passengers and crew on board.
57;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-03-02T20:19:23Z;On the rocks;A reconstruction of how the Costa Concordia ran aground off the coast of Italy;"Arrivederci was the name of the vodka-based cocktail of the day on deck three, bingo was running two decks above, while Martin the Magician was getting his show under way in the Athens theatre of the gleaming Costa Concordia. The night of Friday January 13 was chilly and overcast, the seas calm.A relaxed Francesco Schettino, the 51-year-old captain of the cruise liner, had dined with passengers, among them Domnica Cemortan, a young Moldovan tour operator who later told reporters she had stolen a kiss before he invited her to the ship’s bridge at about 9pm.The vast pleasure palace, with more than 4,200 passengers and crew of many nationalities, had left the Italian port of Civitavecchia two hours earlier, bound for Savona then on to France and Spain for a week-long Mediterranean cruise. The daily bulletin prepared by Costa Cruises, the ship’s Italian operator, advised that the Tuscan island of Giglio would be visible shortly after 9.30pm, although it would be five nautical miles away.But, in a decision known to only a few officers on duty, Capt Schettino set a course that would take the ship much closer to the island. He later told investigators he wanted to impress his head waiter and “salute” Mario Palombo, a retired Costa captain, both Giglio islanders. Costa ships had drawn nearby in the past with no problem.Everyone agrees the captain’s move was an immense mistake. Within minutes, the Costa Concordia struck rocks just off Giglio, surging into them at about 16 knots and ripping a 50-metre gash in its port side that caused the vessel to lose electricity and engine power, and eventually sink. Twenty-five people are confirmed dead and seven more are still listed as missing in a tragedy that is now the focus of intensive judicial and parliamentary investigations.The inquiries – as well as separate lawsuits filed by survivors against Costa Cruises in Italy and its parent company, Miami-based Carnival Corp, in the US – have jolted the entire cruise industry into a review of safety standards, just as the sinking of the Titanic did a century ago. The Concordia’s evacuation, one of the biggest in maritime history, has focused questions on skills and drills in an industry that has had a good safety record and has enjoyed fast-paced expansion and enviable profits in recent years.The Financial Times has reconstructed pivotal moments of the disaster through interviews with witnesses and a review of court statements from the captain and the Italian coastguard, a transcript of the coastguard log, data analysis of the journey and testimony to Italian senators and the US Congress. An unofficial video, apparently filmed by a crew member on the bridge, as well as witness accounts and images shot by passengers, provide vivid detail.The black boxSeven weeks on, gathered in a theatre in the mainland Tuscan town of Grosseto, passengers and crew – joined by their lawyers, investigators and Costa Cruises officials – are to meet on Saturday for the first time since the calamity, as an inquest opens. Under review will be the voyage data recorder.This “black box” – in fact a large orange cylinder – should contain data on timings and the ship’s movements as well as recordings of conversations and orders given on the bridge that night. Investigators hope it will shed light on important unknowns, including why the captain waited to inform authorities of the crash and to give an evacuation order, and why crew told passengers to return to their cabins as the ship was sinking.While Capt Schettino, now under house arrest, has been widely cast as reckless and irresponsible, the black box will help determine whether he had good reason to delay the evacuation – whether he believed the ship could stay afloat – and whether multiple phone calls he made to Costa Cruises’ crisis room that night hindered or helped his handling of the events. Some crew, interviewed by the FT, are withering in their assessment of the captain. “He was a chicken,’’ says one, who describes himself as among “crew members who waited hours and hours to get on a lifeboat …At the end there was not a single officer with us.’’Countdown to disaster: minute-by-minute timeline and maps of the Costa Concordia’s final journeyThe voyage, and the decisions throughout, will long be second-guessed. “Hard to starboard!” Capt Schettino is heard shouting as he spots the outline of Le Scole, an outcrop of rocks off Giglio shortly before the ship hits bottom at about 9.45pm. (According to his later account, radar did not show the smallest rock above the surface.)The manoeuvre swings round the stern of the Costa Concordia – which at 290 metres is the length of about three football pitches – and it smashes into the shoals at a depth of some 8m. “Hard to port!” the captain cries. Then, “Hard to starboard!”For passengers, there is little clue as to what is happening – except for what they can feel. Irina Florea, a 25-year-old model, was in a restaurant close to the stern that took the brunt of the collision. “We had just finished ordering our food when we felt the impact. Everything at the table fell over,” she tells the FT. “We started running towards the stairs.”Ernesto Carusotti and his wife Paola Falconi, retired schoolteachers from Rome, were at the other end of the ship, watching Martin the Magician’s evening act. They felt the ship shake a bit then heard a loudspeaker announcement: there was an electricity failure. “We left the theatre only when we saw the magician come back on stage and then depart. This shocked me,” says Mr Carusotti, who has joined a class action suit organised by Codacons, an Italian consumer group, against Costa Cruises.Water rushes inWithin seven minutes, Capt Schettino is told by crew, as recounted in court testimony, that three compartments, including the engines and generators, are flooded. The captain disputes having this vital information then but power is lost, according to court documents. The ship continues on its own momentum but thousands of tonnes of water are now rushing through a gash that a chief navy engineer describes to the FT as “worse than war damage”.Minutes later, the captain telephones Roberto Ferrarini, director of crisis operations for Costa Cruises on the mainland. Mr Ferrarini later says, in written testimony, that Capt Schettino tells him he hit a shoal and one compartment is flooded. He swiftly calls back to report a second compartment flooded. Accounts of the calls to Costa Cruises – said by Mr Ferrarini to total 17 – are crucial in determining what the captain knew and when.Mr Ferrarini, one of three Costa Cruises officials who are under investigation but have not been charged, informed an Italian senate committee that at one point the captain tried to get him to agree to tell authorities a common “position” of the incident, that a blackout had caused the ship to hit the rocks. “I immediately refused, ordering him to relate facts exactly as they happened,” Mr Ferrarini said in a written statement.The Italian coastguard begins receiving calls from anxious relatives of people on board, saying they have heard of an accident. Crew are telling passengers to don life jackets, they recount. “Is all OK?” a coastguard official asks the Concordia at 10.14pm, according to coastguard logs. A ship’s officer replies three times that it is only a blackout. The coastguard is not convinced and begins summoning ships in the area for help.Meanwhile, Mr Carusotti and his wife are clambering down seven floors on the Costa to reach their cabin to fetch life vests and their mobile phones. “When we were in the cabin the lights went out for the second time, so we ran away without picking up anything else,” he recalls.They climb all the way back to the top deck. “We were all pretty calm, and there were no announcements. It was about 10.30pm …We started to feel the ship keeling,” says his wife. She, like others interviewed by the FT, says they were not sure where to go in an emergency. “We didn’t even know what muster station we had to go to as we had not done the drill yet,” she adds, noting that the evacuation practice was scheduled only for the next day.Luck is now on the side of the slowing cruise liner, as the wind turns it around and pushes it slowly towards Giglio’s rocky shores. The retired teachers, though, now find they are on the wrong side of the vessel, struggling to wrench free a lifeboat as the ship keels. “Can you believe it: I was pushing it with my own hands,’’ she says. They then edge their way to the lower starboard side, press on to another lifeboat and go ashore.At 10.26pm – some 40 minutes after impact, the log shows – the coastguard calls the ship again. Capt Schettino now says it is taking on water and requests a tugboat; he reports no injuries.Erratic evacuationIt is unclear at what time the evacuation order is given. But witness accounts suggest that some crew make a decision, with no direction from the captain, to start evacuating. A bewildered officer on the bridge, seen on video, says: “Passengers are getting into lifeboats on their own.’’ Capt Schettino is on the phone discussing whether to give the emergency alarm that precedes an evacuation signal. “E vabbuò”, he sighs, in Neapolitan dialect: “Oh well.” It is unclear to whom he is speaking.There is no panic on the bridge, but tension shows in the strained voice of an officer urging crew to run from a flooded lower deck. Pumps are not working but industry experts who have studied accounts of the wreck say pumps would have been unable to deal with the torrent pouring in.“Back in the engine room I saw the engineers in panic,” a non-Italian crew member tells the FT, asking not to be named. “Engineers tried to run the emergency pump but the water was coming up very fast.”At 10:34pm, the coastguard log shows the ship declaring it is in distress. Still, Capt Schettino is heard in the video explaining, “We have been taking in water for over half an hour. It is flat calm. God will assist us.’’ He adds: “We have no problems. We just have to set the passengers afloat. Please send us the tugboats at once.’’For David Alexander, a professor and specialist in disaster management who has tracked the case of the Costa Concordia, the captain appears to have succumbed to “normalcy bias”, where disbelief and overconfidence obscure realities too horrible to contemplate. “He wanted to believe things were not as bad as they looked, minimising problems and stalling decisions, while giving or receiving information. And then the command structure simply collapsed,” the professor says.Despite the leadership vacuum, he notes, some crew did improvise. “Several did their duty as best they could, but as a unit they fell apart.”Some cooks, waiters and other staff – many from Asia and South America – were heroes, according to some witnesses. Several crew died. Three trade unions representing crew have defended Costa Cruises and blame “human error” for the tragedy. But such accounts been overwhelmed by accusations and blame, reflected in part by multimillion dollar lawsuits filed in Florida and Chicago.Captain in a lifeboatIt is possible many crew themselves may not have known the gravity of the crisis. Ms Florea, the model from Rome, recalls announcements on the loudspeaker telling passengers to go to their cabins. “Later on they said we had to go to deck four,” she says. “They continued to say that it was only due to an electricity problem, but you could easily see that the ship was tilting and sinking.”Ms Florea, who speaks Russian, translated for confused Russian passengers as others surged towards lifeboats. “Nobody was letting children on first, so I was pushing people around to let the kids get on,” she says.Once Ms Florea was on a lifeboat, she says the crew did not know how to start the engine. “Someone jumped from the ship to the lifeboat to help …Then we hit the side of the ship. The Russian woman put an image of the Virgin Mary in my hands and said that we should pray. People had fainted in the lifeboat. It was hell, with people yelling.”With the ship keeling, lower decks flooding and windows cracking from water pressure, many passengers hurled themselves into the sea to swim ashore, according to witnesses. Three bodies were found floating that night.“We had all been trained. But in this panic situation not all officers were in the position they were supposed to be,” says the crewman who had been in the engine room. He says he saw several officers who did not know how to lower the lifeboats.Witnesses say the first passengers began reaching Giglio by 11pm. At 12.42am, according to the coastguard log, Capt Schettino tells authorities that he too is on a lifeboat, having fallen in by accident. He claims to be directing operations from there. At 1.46am Gregorio De Falco, a senior coastguard officer, bellows down the phone: “Get back on board, damn it!”Instead, the captain goes ashore and makes his way to a Giglio hotel – by taxi, according to some Italian media reports. He is later detained by police and charged with multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning his ship.Port drills and size questionsAs investigations continue in Italy and the US, where the coastguard is interviewing more than 120 American survivors, the tragedy has rattled the industry. Trade officials in Washington this week told a congressional committee that the accident “has had a profound effect’’; safety drills, and how they are followed from country to country, would be reviewed. According to Christine Duffy of the Cruise Lines International Association, “We are wholly committed to examining what happened and to identifying lessons that can be learnt.’’Cruise operators now demand that evacuation drills should be carried out before ships leave port. The standard when the Concordia launched was to hold drills within 24 hours.Ship size, too, is under scrutiny. “The tendency towards gigantism must be stopped. Six to seven thousand people on board a ship is folly,” says Carlo Podenzana, professor of naval engineering at the University of Genoa. Noting the large number of elderly passengers, he suggests a total of 3,000 passengers and crew should be the order of magnitude, although this will mean smaller profits for operators.And what has euphemistically been called “touristic navigation” – sailing close to beauty spots to impress tourists and locals – has been challenged. The Italian authorities on Thursday ruled that large ships must keep two miles from marine parks. Still, powerful industry voices, notably executives of Costa Cruises, defend the showy shoreline salutes.Pierluigi Foschi, chief executive of Costa Cruises, has condemned Capt Schettino’s action that night. But he told an Italian Senate committee, during questioning in late January, that carefully planned “touristic navigation” was “accepted by laws and it enriches the cruise package”.It helps drives business, he said. “We do it because it is desired by passengers and we are competing on the world market.”With Eleonora de Sabata, Giulia Segreti, Cynthia O’Murchu, and Robert Wright"
58;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-03-01T20:11:40Z;Carnival in biggest rally since Concordia disaster;;Carnival showed its sharpest rally since the Costa Concordia disaster as comments from its closest rival helped to quell trading worries.The cruise ship operator bounced 3.9 per cent to £19.20 on Thursday after Royal Caribbean said disruption to the industry had eased over the past few weeks.Although Royal Caribbean said the effect of the incident on 2012 earnings remained uncertain, its figures for February showed bookings holding steady and pricing slightly improved against last year.Carnival shares have dropped by 16 per cent, underperforming Royal Caribbean by 11 per cent, since its Costa Concordia liner capsized off the western coast of Italy in January. A fire on its Costa Allegra ship last week deepened concerns about reputational damage.Brokers saw Royal Caribbean’s guidance as reassuring ahead of Carnival’s next update, due late March.But, with trading still uncertain and the risk remaining of tighter safety regulations or class action litigation, they advised caution on the shares.Morgan Stanley also highlighted fuel prices, which it said had halved Carnival’s operating margins over the past five years. With fuel costs rising to account for about 14 per cent of sales, the volatility of Carnival’s income stream increasingly made it resemble an airline, the broker argued.The wider market followed Wednesday’s biggest decline in a month with the biggest rally in a month. The FTSE 100 ended up 1 per cent, or 59.74 points, to 5,931.25, leaving it little changed over the two days.Man Group led the blue-chip risers, up 12.7 per cent to 147½p, after the hedge fund manager said fund outflows had slowed. Investors also welcomed management’s decision to maintain its dividend and its pledge to return surplus capital in future.Short covering may also have played a role in Man’s rebound, dealers said. Nearly 2.7 per cent of Man Group shares were on loan ahead of the update, the highest percentage in 20 months, according to Data Explorers.Better than expected 2011 results lifted WPP by 3 per cent to 827½p, with the advertising agency proposing a much higher than expected dividend.Kazakhmys led the miners lower, losing 4.2 per cent to £10.62, after its guidance on costs and long-term production disappointed.Weir Group was 3.6 per cent lower at £20.30, taking its fall since results on Wednesday to 7.9 per cent. Panmure Gordon cut the pump-maker off its “buy” list, citing worries that its expansion of oil and gas after-market services may be slower and trickier than thought.C&W Worldwide jumped 14.7 per cent to 32p after Tata Communications said it was considering making an offer. Vodafone, up 1.4 per cent to 171¾p, has until March 12 to table a firm offer for C&W Worldwide while other UK media companies and private equity funds have been linked to the telecoms group.Bid rumours lifted drugmaker Shire, up 0.4 per cent to £22.06, and International Power, up 1.2 per cent to 350p.Spirent Communications, the telecoms test equipment maker, gained 7.7 per cent to 151¾p. Lowered tax guidance and cautiously positive comments on the outlook overshadowed full-year earnings, which were slightly below consensus expectations.Howden Joinery rose 8 per cent to 125½p on results at the upper end of expectations and a return to the dividend list. The kitchen supplier also set out long-term expansion plans, albeit tempered by short-term trading uncertainty.Before a first-quarter sales update next week, Ocado put on 7.5 per cent to 100p. “It would be a surprise if there were any surprises,” said Panmure Gordon. “The company has flagged a similar level of growth to the fourth quarter and no profit numbers will be given.”Recruitment group SThree rose 2.4 per cent to 293p. Goldman Sachs added the stock to its “buy” list as part of a European business services review, which pointed to improving lead indicators.Perform, the online broadcaster for bookmakers, rose 3.9 per cent to 275½p on the back of a post-results upgrade to “buy” from Peel Hunt.Among small caps, Thomas Cook lost 20.4 per cent to 22½p after Investec downgraded it from “buy”. North Sea explorer Ithaca Energy, which received a bid approach this year, rose 14.1 per cent to 199¾p on news it had attracted further interested parties.
59;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-02-28T15:22:05Z;Crippled cruise ship towed to Seychelles;;The more than 1,000 people on board Costa Allegra, the cruise ship crippled by fire in the Indian Ocean, will have to spend a further uncomfortable day-and-a-half aboard the stricken vessel, which is owned by Carnival Corporation.The operator of the ship, which has been without power since the fire in one of its generators, decided it would be impossible to evacuate its passengers at one of the outlying Seychelles islands.The vessel will now be towed to Mahé, the Seychelles’ main island, for those onboard to be taken off, after the cruise line decided there were insufficient hotels and other facilities at the island of Desroches to handle the 636 passengers and 413 crew.“Helicopters will ensure continuous supply of food, comfort items, flashlights in order to mitigate guests’ discomfort given the difficult conditions on board,” the operator said.The delay prolongs the embarrassment for Costa Crociere, the Italian subsidiary of Carnival which operates the ship. Shares in Carnival, the largest international cruise operator by revenues, fell 12p to £18.29 in early afternoon trading on Tuesday.The fire is the second incident involving a Costa ship within the past two months. Costa also operated the Costa Concordia, which struck rocks and overturned off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13, leaving at least 25 people dead and a further seven still missing.“The disembarkation in Desroches does not assure the necessary and adequate security conditions for mooring the ship and guests’ disembarkation,” Costa said. “In addition, logistics and hotels on the island are not enough.”Passengers would have needed to be immediately transferred from Desroches to Mahé by ferry, the line added, meaning they would have arrived at the main island only marginally more quickly than they will aboard the stricken cruise vessel.A French fishing boat that responded to the emergency has been towing the vessel, but the Seychelles government confirmed that two Seychelles Port Authority tugs had reached the ship to speed up the towing process.A Seychelles coast guard cutter – the Andromanche – and a Seychelles air force aircraft will accompany the ship, to guard against attack from Somali pirates who have seized several vessels around the islands since 2009.Before the fire, the Allegra, which left Madagascar on Saturday, had been due to arrive on Tuesday at Port Victoria, the Seychelles’ capital.In a separate statement, Costa explained the extent of the fire protection measures on board the ship, including thick metal bulkheads to isolate the fire in a single area and specialist fire-suppression equipment in the highest-risk areas, such as the generator room where the blaze broke out.“These measures allowed the prompt bringing under control and extinguishing of the fire that broke out in the Costa Allegra generator room,” it said.The fire will heighten concerns in the cruise industry ahead of March’s Cruise Shipping Miami congress, the industry’s biggest annual event, that cruising could lose its previously good reputation for safety.Both Carnival and Royal Caribbean Cruises, the two biggest cruise companies by revenue, had reported four weeks ago that bookings were down about 15 per cent on the previous year in the wake of the Concordia accident, but that they had started to recover.
60;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-02-27T17:33:12Z;Costa cruise ship adrift off Seychelles after fire;;A cruise ship was left drifting with 1,049 people on board following a fire in the Indian Ocean on Monday dealing a fresh blow to its London-listed owner Carnival Corporation, which was also involved in January’s fatal accident off the Italian coast.The ship’s operator said it was told at 10.39am Italian time that the Costa Allegra, on its way from Madagascar to the Seychelles, suffered a fire in its aft electrical generator room, which had been extinguished without injuries or casualties and without spreading to other parts of the ship.However, the vessel remained without power near where the fire took place, 200 miles south-west of the main group of Seychelles islands. The incident is likely to raise more questions about cruise shipping’s safety standards.Costa Crociere, the operator which is a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation, said in a statement: “Inspections on the state of the engine room are ongoing, in order to restart the necessary equipment to reactivate the functionality of the ship.“Costa Crociere and the relevant authorities are active to provide the ship with the necessary support according to the development of the situation. Costa Allegra is going to be reached by tugs and other naval and aerial units.”The Italian coastguard had asked the Seychelles authorities to help and had asked merchant ships in the area to come to the stricken vessel’s assistance, the company said.At least 25 people were killed and a further seven remain missing after the Costa Concordia capsized after hitting rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio on January 13. That incident had already led to the launch of a safety review across the cruise sector, by individual cruise lines and the International Maritime Organisation, the UN agency in charge of international maritime safety rules.The Costa Allegra fire is reminiscent of a number in recent years where fires or other incidents in a cruise ship’s complex engine and generating equipment have left the vessel disabled. The Carnival Splendor, operated by another arm of Carnival Corporation, was disabled by a fire off the coast of Mexico in November 2010 and needed to be towed into the port of Ensenada.Costa said the Costa Allegra’s master had given the signal for those on board, made up of 636 passengers and 413 crew, to assemble at muster stations and all those not involved in management of the crisis had assembled with the necessary safety equipment.The Costa Allegra, 188m long and able to carry up to 1,400 people, is far smaller than the 291m-long Costa Concordia, which was carrying a near-capacity 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew.The London-traded shares of Carnival, which is listed in both London and New York, fell 31p, or 1.7 per cent, to £18.41.Both Carnival, the world’s largest cruise line by turnover, and Royal Caribbean Cruises, the number two, announced four weeks ago that cruise bookings were down by around 15 per cent in the wake of the Concordia accident. However, they expressed hope that as reporting of the incident tailed off, bookings would recover.
61;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-02-09T22:45:07Z;Cruise ships to hold pre-departure drills;;Passengers travelling with companies belonging to the three biggest cruise shipping organisations will go through safety drills before leaving port, under a shake-up in the wake of the January 13 sinking of the cruise ship Costa Concordia.The Cruise Lines International Association, European Cruise Council and Passenger Shipping Association – representing the US, mainland European and British cruise industries, respectively – said “muster drills” would now be mandatory on their members’ ships before they left port.The three associations said their members were introducing the new rule voluntarily as part of a safety review announced on January 27 in the wake of the disaster, which left at least 17 dead and 15 missing.The new rule exceeds the demands of the International Maritime Organisation’s Safety of Life at Sea Convention, which demands only that a muster drill be held within 24 hours of departure from port. There has been speculation that the evacuation of the 4,300 passengers and crew on board the Costa Concordia, which was only a few hours out of the port of Civitavecchia, would have gone more smoothly if the ship had already held a muster drill.“The formal policy is designed to help ensure that any mandatory musters or briefings are conducted for the benefit of all newly embarked passengers at the earliest practical opportunity,” it said.Cruise shipping companies have been scrambling since the accident to reassure passengers about safety standards on board their ships, which most experts say remain high despite the lapses that led the Costa Concordia’s captain to steer the vessel into rocks near the Tuscan island of Giglio.Both Carnival, the largest cruise line by revenues and parent company of the Costa Concordia’s owner, and Royal Caribbean Cruises, number two by revenues, announced last week that bookings had fallen about 15 per cent worldwide after the Costa Concordia accident.As well as the cruise industry’s own safety review, announced on January 27, the IMO, the UN body that draws up maritime regulations, has announced its own review of safety issues. It is likely to include issues such as whether ships carrying as many passengers as the latest cruise ships – some of which carry more than 6,000 people – can be evacuated fast enough in an emergency.The cruise industry insists it generally has a very good safety record, with only 16 people having died in maritime accidents on cruise ships between 2005 and 2010, when there were nearly 100m trips.
62;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-02-02T16:34:20Z;Royal Caribbean feels effect of cruise disaster;;Royal Caribbean Cruises on Thursday became the first operator to reveal a full and detailed impact of the Costa Concordia disaster on its bookings, saying first-quarter earnings per share could be 20-60 per cent lower than expectations as a result of the January 13 capsize off Italy.The statement from the world’s second-largest cruise line by revenues comes after Carnival, whose subsidiary Costa Crociere operated the Costa Concordia, said in a regulatory filing on Monday that in percentage terms its bookings were down in the “mid-teens” since the accident. The incident, which left 17 confirmed dead and 15 unaccounted for, would cost it $375m-$395m this year, Carnival estimated.Carnival is much the largest cruise operator by annual revenues, with Royal Caribbean the only other significant operator in the key US and European markets.Wyn Ellis, leisure analyst at Numis Securities, said potential new customers appeared to be feeling “a little bit more wary” than they otherwise would about booking cruises and were pursuing other holiday options.“The 64 million dollar question is: how long will the bookings remain very weak?” Mr Ellis said.Miami-based Royal Caribbean, whose brands include Celebrity Cruises, Pullmantur and Azamara Club Cruises, gave far greater detail than Carnival’s filing. Before the accident, it said, it had expected improvements in yield – earnings per berth – to be in the “mid-single digits” over 2011, adjusted for currency movements. It now expected improvements of only 1-5 per cent on last year.“Not surprisingly, while our industry has been in the glare of the media spotlight for three weeks, we have seen an impact,” Brian Rice, chief financial officer, told an investor conference call.The company gave unusually wide ranges for all its guidance on earnings, saying that first-quarter earnings per share, which analysts had been forecasting at 25 cents, would be 10-20 cents.“We are still on track to achieve our original projections for the first quarter but there is a high degree of uncertainty and it is difficult to judge the impact of the tragedy on the balance of the year,” Mr Rice said.Royal Caribbean’s post-accident warning came as Costa Crociere announced it had asked 10 salvage companies to tender to remove the wreck of the Concordia, from which Smit of the Netherlands is currently removing fuel. They have been asked to submit bids by the beginning of March, with the successful bidder selected by the end of that month.“This timeline represents the best possible outcome in a situation of this kind, although it cannot be excluded that there will be delays, given the complexity of the operation,” it said.Royal Caribbean also unveiled net profits for 2011 up 18 per cent to $607m on revenues up 10 per cent to $7.5bn.Overall booking volumes from North America had fallen by “low to mid-teen percentages versus the same time last year for the last few weeks”, it said.“In Europe, where media coverage has been more extensive, the decline has been steeper, though results vary significantly by country,” it added.Royal Caribbean’s shares fell 3.12 per cent in New York to $27.36.
63;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-01-28T05:30:54Z;Divisions over cruise disaster pay-out plan;;Costa Cruises, Italian operator of the Costa Concordia liner that sank off the island of Giglio two weeks ago with more than 4,200 people on board, said on Friday that it had reached a compensation agreement for passengers with 15 Italian consumer organisations.The agreement, which offers passengers €11,000 each plus reimbursement of the cost of the cruise, return travel and other expenses, was however rejected by at least two Italian consumer groups that are considering class-action lawsuits.Separately, Miami-based Carnival Corp, parent company of Costa Cruises, is facing legal action in the US brought by a crew member.Costa Cruises said the agreement, reached late on Thursday, covered passengers for losses of belongings and psychological trauma but did not apply to those who had suffered injuries or to the families of those who lost their lives.More than 3,200 passengers were on board the cruise liner, the largest ship ever built in Italy, which hit rocks on January 13 and then ran aground where it turned on its side. Rescue workers have recovered 16 bodies from the half-submerged wreck and 16 other people are listed as missing.Costa Cruises said the compensation exceeded the amounts foreseen in international conventions related to such events.Carlo Pileri, president of Adoc, one of the 15 associations that signed the agreement, called it a “historic accord” that would avoid the need for a class-action lawsuit, noting that about 900 of the passengers were Italian.Given the length of time – possibly years – it might take to pursue further action through the Italian courts, some consumer groups believe that passengers could be attracted by the offer of immediate compensation.But Carlo Rienzi, head of the Codacons consumer association, urged passengers to reject the offer and pursue a class-action lawsuit it is organising in Italy and the US. Codacons said last week that 200 passengers had joined its suit. “It’s a really bad offer from Costa,” Marco Ramedori of Codacons told the Financial Times.Marc Bern, senior partner at Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik, one of the law firms organising the lawsuit, called the offer “insulting”. Codacons said that it was looking for at least $160,000 per passenger. “Nobody thought they’d get on the next Titanic,” Mr Bern said.Mr Bern yesterday filed a separate civil suit in Florida against Carnival and Costa Cruises claiming compensatory damages in excess of $10m and punitive damages of $450m for six passengers. It alleges the companies were aware that the ship’s captain, Francesco Schettino, did “sail-by-salutes” and that they “were aware, or should have been aware, that Costa Concordia did not have a sufficient alarm system that would alert crew and passengers of an emergency”.Confconsumatori, another consumer group, also said it had decided not to sign the agreement pending the results of Italy’s criminal investigation into the disaster.News agencies citing court documents filed in a federal court in Chicago on Thursday reported that Carnival was being sued by crew member Gary Lobaton who is seeking a class-action status to represent all victims of the accident.“The defendants failed to properly and timely notify all plaintiffs on board of the deadly and dangerous condition of the cruise ship as to avoid injury and death,” Mr Lobaton, who was living in Lima, Peru, said in the complaint. They “were abandoned by the captain”, he said.The International Transport Workers’ Federation, meanwhile, said it had won an agreement on compensation for the 1,023 crew members who were aboard the vessel when it ran aground. Workers will be paid until the end of their contracts or at least for two months for those near the end of their contracts. They will also be able to claim reimbursement for some of the expenses incurred, as well as for travel and healthcare expenses and up to $3,570 for any personal effects lost.Francesco Schettino, the captain, is under house arrest accused of multiple manslaughter, causing a ship wreck and abandoning his ship. Italian investigators have so far focused on the roles played by the ship’s officers and have not extended their probe into actions by Costa Cruises or Carnival.Costa Cruises has blamed the captain for the disaster and has also filed a lawsuit as an “injured party”.Marco Brusco, a senior Italian Coast Guard official, told a Senate committee hearing on Thursday that lives had been lost because the captain had “wasted a precious hour” before giving the evacuation order.Investigators have not yet opened the ship’s black box, which should contain recordings of the telephone conversations that were held between Mr Schettino and Roberto Ferrarini, head of operations for Costa Cruises, after the ship hit the rocks some 150 metres off Giglio and before the captain issued the SOS and evacuation order.Pierluigi Foschi, chief executive of Costa Cruises, has accused the captain of deviating from the company-approved route and failing promptly to alert the operators of the gravity of the situation.Additional reporting by Robert Wright in London
64;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-01-23T19:25:32Z;Salvage teams set to pump fuel from liner;;Dutch salvage operators plan on Tuesday to start removing some 2,400 tonnes of fuel from the stricken Costa Concordia off the coast of Italy, while the criminal probe into the sinking of the cruise liner is expected to widen beyond accusations against its two senior officers.Smit Salvage has been given the green light by Italian authorities to start pumping out fuel to prevent an environmental disaster off the Tuscan island of Giglio, which lies within the Mediterranean’s largest marine sanctuary.Authorities had earlier said the salvage operation would have to wait until the rescue mission was declared over. Divers have recovered 15 bodies but about 20 are believed missing. Several corpses have not been identified, which officials said raises the question of whether the passenger list was complete. Costa Cruises, the Italian operator and a unit of Carnival Corp, listed 4,232 passengers and crew on board when the ship hit rocks close to Giglio on January 13.Italian prosecutors so far have focused on Francesco Schettino, captain, and Ciro Ambrosio, first officer. Mr Schettino, who is under house arrest, is accused of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning his vessel.Bruno Leporatti, defence lawyer for Mr Schettino, said the captain’s telephone conversations with the operations director of Costa Cruises after the ship hit the rocks had “opened further channels of investigation which could lead to a widening” of those being probed. Third parties “could have contributed to determining the tragic event”, Mr Leporatti said.Investigators are probing the route taken by the Costa Concordia, said to have been 150 metres off shore when it ran aground, and the practice of ships sailing close by to “salute” locals and give passengers a nice view. The government has said this practice must stop.Pier Luigi Foschi, chief executive of Costa Cruises, said the approved route of the ship should have taken it five nautical miles off Giglio. He told the Financial Times last week that it was possible that on other occasions captains had deviated from their company-approved routes, as Mr Schettino is accused of doing.An official source told the FT that checks of courses taken by Mr Schettino as captain of the Costa Concordia since last September had not revealed deviations from the approved route off Giglio before the January 13 disaster. The ship’s black box has not yet been examined.Mr Schettino said in his deposition to a judge last week that he had decided to go close to Giglio “out of courtesy” to a waiter from the island working on the ship and to a retired captain who lived there. He said he had carried out similar “tourist navigations” past Giglio and other islands on the Costa Europa – also owned by Costa Cruises – and while captain of ships under Tirrenia, his previous employers.Mr Schettino said he set the wrong course by calculating his distance from a large visible rock instead of from a smaller rock farther out to sea. He admitted that rocks there are clearly marked on charts.
65;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-01-20T20:06:16Z;Concordia ‘not first to deviate from routes’;;The chief executive of Costa Cruises, Italian operator of the Costa Concordia cruise ship that capsized last Friday after venturing dangerously close to a Tuscan island, said it was possible other captains may have deviated from company-approved routes in the area.“It’s possible they did without us knowing,” Pier Luigi Foschi, said in a telephone interview. “That’s what [the Costa Concordia captain] did.”According to positioning data seen by the Financial Times, two of the Costa Concordia’s sister ships, the Costa Pacifica and Costa Allegria, both came well within a mile of Giglio island on three occasions in August and September 2010. Costa Cruises refused to comment on the data collated by IHS Fairplay, a maritime information service.The Costa Concordia’s captain, Francesco Schettino, has been accused by prosecutors of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning his ship. In a court hearing this week, he admitted deviating from his set course and was reported as saying he fell into a life-raft by mistake.Mr Foschi said the Costa Concordia should have been five nautical miles off Giglio, and accused Mr Schettino of delays in issuing the SOS and evacuation order and of giving false information to company headquarters after he hit the rocks. Prosecutors said the ship hit rocks marked on charts about 150 metres off shore.“The information from the captain to us all was there was a blackout, an electrical blackout,” Mr Foschi said. “I agree there was a delay. It was an abnormal delay.”Mr Schettino, who is under house arrest, spoke to Roberto Ferrarini, Costa Cruises’ director of operations, Mr Foschi added, referring to at least two telephone conversations that night.“I am unable to say exactly when Costa Cruises was aware of the seriousness of the situation, but not in the first or second call. When we called several people on board we started realising,” Mr Foschi said. “It was probably 35 to 40 minutes after the incident we started knowing something serious was happening.”Mr Schettino’s defence lawyer was not immediately available for comment. The Ansa news agency earlier quoted him as saying that his client “informed the company straight away about the problems on the Costa Concordia ship, as was his duty to do”.Mr Foschi added that the company, owned by Carnival Corp of Miami, was carrying out its own internal investigation and would speak next week to Mr Ferrarini who was on the island of Giglio where the ship is resting half-submerged and in danger of sliding into deeper waters. Mr Foschi said he had not spoken himself to the captain or to Mr Ferrarini since the disaster.Italian prosecutors leading the official investigation have said the delay of about 45 minutes in starting the evacuation when the ship was listing dangerously might have cost lives. Eleven bodies have been recovered so far and more than 20 are still listed as missing from the 4,232 passengers and crew said by Costa Cruises to have been on board.According to Costa Cruises, it had previously given only one authorisation for the Costa Concordia to approach Giglio – last August 14 when another captain was in charge, to mark the island’s saints day. Mr Foschi did not dispute a report by Lloyds List that the ship came within 230 metres of the island on that day, but said it had passed the harbour and was safe within deep waters. He noted that no shipping regulations forbade that.One lesson learnt from the disaster, Mr Foschi said, was to check the routes taken by ships after their voyages. “We are looking to see if there is technology able to do that,” he said, stressing that the company adhered to all safety standards and believed it was as “good as others” in terms of security.“We express our deepest sorrow to the families who lost their relatives,” Mr Foschi said.Il Secolo XIX, a Genoa newspaper, quoted a witness as saying he saw the captain, another officer and a 25-year-old Moldovan woman drinking a “decanter of wine” in a ship restaurant less than an hour before the ship hit the rocks.
66;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-01-20T19:20:45Z;Focus shifts from ship’s captain to company;;"Rescue workers were still scrambling to find survivors from the ill-fated Costa Concordia this week when Pier Luigi Foschi, Costa Cruises’ chief executive, blamed the ship’s captain for the wreck and described the rest of the crew as heroes.But as the week progressed, the company’s strategy to make Captain Francesco Schettino the face of the disaster off the coast of Italy was shaken by comments from passengers, crew and even revelations about some of the company’s own practices.As the fallout from the accident continues, the question of who was to blame will be played out in the courts as all parties seek to limit the damage.Costa’s effort to quickly isolate a culprit – the captain who had made a showy move close to shore to “salute” a fellow sailor – has been called surprising by some industry experts and may pose some risk to the company as investigators begin to wade through prior practices of the Italian operators, a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp.“These incidents are complicated; it requires a reviewing of the black box and really understanding what has taken place,” said William Wright, maritime expert for Cruise Lines International Association, a North American cruise lobby.“The standard procedure is to put the captain on administrative leave while the investigation is conducted. But it appears that they were very quick to put the blame on the captain,’’ said Mr Wright, who is also senior vice-president of marine operations at Royal Caribbean International, a competitor to Costa.Legal experts said the company is vulnerable to possible claims of corporate liability as, in addition to 29 people dead or missing, details of a chaotic evacuation emerge and the authorities seek to avert an environmental disaster by removing 500,000 gallons of unspent fuel from the cracked hull.Codacons, the Italian consumer rights association, on Thursday told the Financial Times that it was organising a civil class action suit that so far has attracted 200 passengers. Codacons plans to demand €50,000 for each passenger.Craig Allen, law professor at the US Coast Guard Academy, told the FT the company may underscore the actions of the captain as renegade but that does not always mean the corporation is off the hook.A pattern of what the company allowed over time is also important, he said. “You have a duty to enquire whatever a shipowner could find out by looking at the details [of routes taken] and if they failed to take action. That’s negligence.’’Sarosh Zaiwalla, a lawyer and maritime expert in London, said a big question was whether Captain Schettino was “on a frolic of his own’’ and, if he was, if Costa either “knew about it or could find out”.Unauthorised route detours are not considered uncommon in passenger shipping: they are known in the industry lexicon as a “thrill diversion” or “fly-by”. A reef off the Orcas island between Vancouver and Seattle even bears the name “Elwha Rock” in memory of one misjudged manoeuvre in the 1980s.Captain Schettino, now under house arrest, has become a target of outrage after prosecutors accused him of conducting a “reckless manoeuvre’’ and leaving the ship as passengers were still struggling to find lifeboats.The captain told reporters in the hours just after the incident that the ship had hit uncharted rocks. He later said in court that he had sailed the cruiser, with 4,200 people aboard, just a few hundred metres near the island to sound a horn in “salute” to a former captain living there.The company’s statements have focused on the captain with little said about the rest of the crew. However in media interviews, passengers have complained that the evacuation was hampered by crew who did not know how to unleash lifeboats and delays in sounding alarms.The crew themselves, in media interviews, said that the alarm was late and that they were instructed to tell passengers that the ship had suffered an electrical problem.Passengers also said the ship had not yet held its evacuation drill. Although this is usually done before the ship leaves port, the law does allow the drill to be held within 24 hours of embarcation.Mr Foschi defended the company’s safety record on Monday and said “all our crew members behaved like heroes. All of them.’’ As for the captain, Mr Foschi said that he had taken “unapproved, unauthorized, unknown to Costa’’ manoeuvres that were “contrary to our written rules of behaviour”.But the company’s message became muddled as Mr Foschi admitted later that the same 114,500 tonne vessel had done the same manoeuvre – even closer to the Giglio – in August last year with the company’s approval.Burson-Marsteller, Costa Crociere’s spokespeople in London, said the “normal” route guides keep its passenger cruise liners five miles from the coast of Giglio. They also said that on August 14 – the day the company sanctioned a route closer to the island – the ship was authorised to sail only as close as 500m from shore.Later in the week, the company had little to say about a revelation by Lloyd’s List, a maritime industry information service, that showed the ship actually moved in as close as 230m to shore in August.And on Friday IHS Fairplay, another maritime information service provided the FT with data showing that in 2010 two separate Costa cruise ships had also sailed close to the coast of Giglio. Costa declined to comment on the new data but Mr Foschi earlier said that it was possible that other ships had deviated from their agreed courses.Most ships by regulation carry a radio transmitter which signals the ship’s position, course and identity.It is that data – which goes back several years – that may now detail how often Costa’s cruise ships took a different route."
67;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-01-20T01:55:08Z;Cruise group launches safety review;;The parent of the cruise line whose vessel hit rocks off the Italian coast last Friday says it is launching a “comprehensive audit and review of all safety and emergency response procedures” across all its 10 cruise lines.In one of his first public responses to the accident – after which 11 bodies have been recovered and 22 people remain missing – Micky Arison, chief executive of Carnival Corporation, admitted that the Costa Concordia’s grounding and capsizing had “called into question” the company’s safety and emergency response procedures and practices.“While I have every confidence in the safety of our vessels and the professionalism of our crews, this review will evaluate all practices and procedures to make sure this kind of accident doesn’t happen again,” said Mr Arison.Carnival owns a series of cruise brands, including Cunard, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises and Princess Cruises, as well as Costa, owner of the Concordia.News of Carnival’s move comes as stormy weather approaching the Italian island of Giglio could force rescue workers to abandon their search of the stricken cruise liner. That would further delay the start of salvage operations to offload 2,400 tonnes of fuel that threaten an environmental disaster in the Mediterranean’s largest marine sanctuary.The rescue workers are looking for those still missing from the 4,232 passengers and crew that Costa Cruises has said were on board at the time of the accident.“Our priority is to keep searching for bodies and possible survivors. No time limit has been set,” said a rescue operations spokesman. Two bodies were identified as French passengers on Thursday.Officials are concerned that bad weather might tip the ship from the rocky shelf where it lies half-submerged into deeper waters where it would risk breaking up and spilling fuel from its tanks. Rescue divers suspended work on Wednesday after the Costa Concordia shifted, and salvage operations cannot begin until the search is declared over.Corrado Clini, Italy’s environment minister, has described the cruise ship as a “mini-oil tanker”, carrying about 1,800 tonnes of heavy bunker fuel and several hundred tonnes of lighter fuel used for generators.Winds of up to 30 knots are forecast to approach the west side of Giglio on Friday, bringing waves of up to 1.5 metres. Fortunately, the wreck is on the east and more sheltered side of the island, facing the Tuscan mainland.Carnival’s move came on the same day that Christine Duffy, who chairs the Cruise Lines International Association, a trade organisation, called on the UN body that oversees maritime safety to re-examine regulations for large passenger ships. Carnival said it supported the call on the International Maritime Organisation, made at a conference in London.Carnival said its review would be led by James Hunn, a retired US navy captain who was currently the company’s senior vice-president of maritime policy and compliance. Mr Hunn and senior health and safety executives from each of the lines would review all safety and emergency response policies and procedures, officer and crew training and evaluation, bridge management and company-wide response and support efforts.Ezio Amato, Italy’s leading marine pollution scientist, describes the bunker fuel as having the consistency of “toothpaste”, which salvage workers need to heat up before pumping out. Heavier than seawater, it would sink and disperse with underwater currents, whose movements are little known.“We don’t really know where it will end up. Gasoline is lighter and very toxic, too. But certainly the entire archipelago and Monte Argentario [a popular tourist area across the strait] will be affected. It all depends on how and if the ship sinks – in one piece or if it breaks up,” he told the Financial Times.Giglio is part of the Tuscan archipelago that lies within two protected areas that embrace the Mediterranean’s largest known concentration of marine mammals, including fin and sperm whales, dolphins and monk seals. The wider area is the Pelagos sanctuary – the world’s first international sanctuary for marine mammals declared in 2001 by Italy, France and Monaco, extending from Sardinia to Corsica and waters beyond to France.The amount of fuel carried by the fully laden Costa Concordia is nearly seven times greater than that on board the cargo ship Rena which last October caused New Zealand’s worst environmental disaster for decades. But it is significantly less than the 30,000 tonnes of oil carried by the tanker Erika, which sank off France’s Brittany coast in 1999.Smit Salvage, based in the Netherlands, was awarded the contract by Costa Cruises to retrieve the cruise liner’s fuel, an operation that a representative in Italy said would take “some weeks”. Their emergency response team moved in last Saturday and operations are ready to start once the rescue work has been declared over.Costa Cruises said on Thursday it had ended its legal assistance to Francesco Schettino, the ship’s captain who is under house arrest accused of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning his vessel. The unit of Miami-based Carnival also said it had filed a suit as an injured party with Italian prosecutors.Mr Schettino, who was suspended by Costa Cruises on Thursday, admitted to a judge on Tuesday that he had diverted from his approved course in order to get close to Giglio. Newspapers reported that he had wanted to “salute” a retired captain, who lived on the island, and was on the telephone with him when he hit the rocks that tore a 70-metre gash in the hull.Additional reporting by Giulia Segreti and Eleonora de Sabata in Rome
68;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-01-18T17:54:02Z;Investigators probe cruise ship’s Italy routes;;Italian investigators probing the sinking of the Costa Concordia off the coast of Tuscany are examining previous routes taken by the captain of the cruise ship and the conduct of its Italian operators, a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp.Francesco Schettino, the ship’s captain who is under house arrest, was reported to have told a court hearing that he had carried out a similar manoeuvre close to Giglio island three or four times before Friday’s disaster.Just how close to land giant cruise ships have sailed has become a focal point of investigations, with government officials saying this practice of “saluting” locals and entertaining tourists must stop.“A tolerated, yet not sustainable, custom that has resulted in an outcome visible to all must not be tolerated any more,” Corrado Clini, environment minister, told parliament on Wednesday.Rescue workers combing the semi-submerged hulk of the Costa Concordia have recovered 11 bodies, with hopes fading for 23 people still listed as missing. Mr Clini said the ship, lying on its side and shifting on the edge of deeper waters, was unstable and that it was a “battle against time” to recover 2,400 tonnes of fuel from its tanks.Before being arrested on Friday night, the captain told reporters he had been “more or less” 300 metres from Giglio when he hit rocks, which he said were uncharted. At his court hearing he was quoted by Judge Valeria Montesarchio as saying the ship had been 508 metres from land. Italian prosecutors said the rocks were marked on charts.Mr Schettino – who is accused of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning his ship – also admitted to the judge that he had deviated from his set course.Newspapers quoted him as telling the closed hearing that he had gone close to Giglio to “salute” a retired Costa captain, Mario Palombo, who lived on the island. He was on the telephone to Mr Palombo, who happened to be on the mainland at the time, when he hit the rocks.Lloyd’s List, a London newspaper, reported on the basis of vessel tracking data that the Costa Concordia had sailed within 230 metres of Giglio last August, and questioned the “approved routes” authorised by Costa Cruises, the ship’s Italian operators.Costa Cruises said it had given the Costa Concordia permission to go as close as 500 metres to Giglio on one occasion last August for the island’s saints day. It had no immediate comment on the report by Lloyd’s List. It also declined to say if its executives had been questioned by investigators.Costa Cruises said the 500-metre rule was set by the Italian coast guard and “international rules”, and that the coast guard had authorised the approach to that distance.The coast guard denied that such a rule existed and denied giving such authorisation. Officials told the Financial Times that there was not a limit, except for certain areas in the summer where vessels may not come within 200 metres of beaches. Prosecutors were examining previous voyages by ships of Costa Cruises, an official said.The chairman of Rina, the Italian classification society that provided certification for Costa Concordia, has resigned amid controversy over remarks he was reported to have made in which he suggested that Costa Cruises “could not but have known” that its ships regularly went close to Giglio.Rina said Gianni Scerni disputed the comments he was reported to have made, but had resigned to distance Rina from any association with the alleged remarks.In her report on the hearing, the judge said Mr Schettino had made a “reckless manoeuvre” by altering his route to a so-called tourist navigation when he hit the submerged rock.“The captain with incompetence and negligence underestimated the scale of the damages and omitted to timely inform the coastal authorities . . . therefore delaying the emergency and rescue procedures,” the judge said. “The captain lost control of the ship, whose engines were dead and was only moving through drift and helm.”The captain admitted abandoning his ship when at least 100 people were still on board and made no serious effort to return, the judge said. Her order for Mr Schettino to be placed under house arrest is being appealed against by the prosecutor who wants him to be jailed until trial.While Mr Schettino is being portrayed in the media as a national villain who disgraced his country, while the coast guard captain on shore who furiously ordered him to return to his ship is being feted as Italy’s hero.T-shirts are already being made with “Get on board, damn it!”, the words of Captain Gregorio De Falco, whose recorded telephone conversation with Mr Schettino has been widely reported.Mr Schettino is reported to have told the judge that he was helping passengers to get away in a life-raft, and that he was knocked out in the process and found himself lying in the boat being taken to shore. Newspapers also reported that two other officers were in the same boat.
69;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-01-18T17:48:29Z;Siphoning Concordia fuel to take weeks;;One of the world’s largest marine salvage contractors, the Netherlands’ Smit Salvage, is to spend the next two to four weeks removing fuel from the stricken Costa Concordia in an attempt to prevent it spilling into the sea.The vessel has about 2,400 tonnes of tar-like heavy fuel oil – the thick and noxious byproduct of refining that most ships use – and about 200 tonnes of diesel fuel on board, according to Lloyd’s List, the maritime daily.Smit told the Financial Times it had been awarded the contract to remove the fuel on Tuesday. The company, which has extensive experience of worldwide salvage operations, is expected to drill into the fuel tanks and siphon off the fuel.Ship salvage companies have in recent years increasingly come to focus on avoiding the kind of environmental pollution seen in New Zealand after the grounding of the container ship Rena in October.Their emphasis previously was on rescuing cargo or ships to reduce the economic loss from accidents.Smit stressed that it had not yet been awarded any work to salvage the vessel.The nature of that work will depend on whether insurers decide it is worth saving or will need to be broken up in situ.
70;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-01-17T22:44:24Z;Concordia captain under house arrest;;Italian rescue workers seeking survivors in the semi-submerged wreckage of the Costa Concordia used explosives on Tuesday to enter inaccessible areas of the cruise liner, finding five more bodies amid continuing confusion over the numbers still missing.Recovery of the corpses of four men and one woman took the confirmed death toll from Friday’s disaster to 11, leaving 24 people still unaccounted for among more than 4,000 who had been on board, according to latest figures released by the Italian civil protection agency.Francesco Schettino, the captain, was interrogated by a judge in the Tuscan town of Grosseto after being arrested and accused of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning his vessel. The judge ordered the captain to be placed under house arrest. Francesco Verusio, chief prosecutor in Grosseto, said he could face a 15-year jail sentence.Italian media quoted sources in the closed-door hearing as saying the captain denied abandoning the ship and confirmed being on the bridge when the accident happened.Costa Cruises, the ship’s Italian operator and a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp, has blamed the disaster on the captain.Harry Curtis, Nomura analyst, said Carnival’s long-term earnings power had declined about 5 per cent as a result of the disaster.“It may take years to repair the brand damage that Costa has sustained and we expect higher costs for crew training, not to mention the uncertainty Carnival will suffer in the near term over insurance coverage, as well as its inadequate response to this tragedy,” Mr Curtis said.Carnival Corp’s shares plunged 13.7 per cent to end at $29.60 on Tuesday. While shares of rival cruise operator Royal Caribbean Cruises were down more than 6 per cent at $26.97.Costa Cruises accused Mr Schettino of veering off course to steer dangerously close to the island of Giglio off Tuscany.Before Mr Schettino was arrested on Friday night, he told reporters he had taken the 292-metre ship to within about 300 metres of the island of Giglio where he said it had hit rocks not marked on charts.Officials insist the rocks are clearly noted on charts. Corriere della Sera, Italy’s leading newspaper, reported that divers had found the spot where the ship had torn a 70-metre gash in its hull after hitting rocks at a depth of about eight metres. The position was about 95 metres from the Scola rock that rises from the water, and about 300 metres from the island itself.Costa Cruises confirmed that it had given the captain permission to sail within 500 metres of Giglio last August on the occasion of the island’s saint’s day, but not last Friday. Islanders say it was common practice for cruise ships to come close to “salute” Giglio. Prosecutors said they were investigating the entire chain of command to determine how and why the Concordia ran aground.Anxious families awaiting news of their missing relatives received a blow on Monday night when authorities raised the number of missing. A spokeswoman for Costa Cruises was not able to say immediately if the company had changed its count of the numbers who had been on board, initially given as 3,216 passengers and 1,013 crew.Investigators are also questioning an earlier assertion by Costa Cruises that the captain made an emergency manoeuvre after hitting the rocks to take the ship into shallower waters near Giglio harbour. Investigators said it was possible the ship had drifted there after losing power. They say the captain only made an SOS about one hour after the initial impact.Italian media have broadcast the tape of what they say is a telephone conversation between the captain and a coast guard commander based in Livorno on the mainland. The commander is heard shouting and swearing at the captain – who says he is on shore – ordering him to return to his ship to help in the evacuation which was still continuing amid scenes of panic and confusion, with many swimming ashore.The captain said he would return but media reported that he instead took a taxi to a hotel on the island.
71;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-01-16T22:37:39Z;Safety on the high seas faces scrutiny;;Carnival Corp has had little hesitation in seeking to pin the blame for the Costa Concordia disaster on the ship’s captain, Francesco Schettino.“The captain decided to enter into water he did not know in advance,” said Pier Luigi Foschi, chief executive of the Carnival subsidiary Costa Crociere, at a Monday press conference in Genoa. Captain Schettino said immediately following the disaster that he was 300 metres offshore and hit a rock not marked on the charts.For the cruise industry, with an estimated 2012 revenue of $30.2bn, an incident as grave and as high profile as the sinking of a 114,500-tonne vessel can cause lasting and material damage. As Wyn Ellis, analyst with Numis, points out, the cause of the incident could determine the scale of the financial damage the industry will face.“The big problem there would be something structurally wrong with the design of the ship and something inherently unsafe,” says Mr Ellis. “But if it was the ship being steered on to uncharted rocks, you would look back and say, it was a tragic error – life goes on.”There is little doubt that Carnival, the world’s largest cruise ship operator, with 101 vessels and brands including P&O, Cunard and Princess Cruises, faces at the very least short-term upheaval.The London and Miami-based company, with listings in London and New York, acknowledged on Monday that the loss in earnings from being without the Costa Concordia was as much as $95m this year.But that does not take into account other potential factors, including the permanent loss of the ship, which has 3,800 berths and cost €475m, the impact on consumer sentiment during a key booking period in the year, and possible tighter safety regulations for cruise ships.The worst-case scenario, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Jamie Rollo in a note, is a continual period of review of cruise ship safety.The Nautilus Union, which represents maritime professionals, has raised concerns about the size of cruise ships, the adequacy of life-saving equipment and the challenge of large-scale evacuations. The International Maritime Organisation said in response to the Costa Concordia disaster that it is prepared to review safety on large ships.“It is likely that many passengers will be reluctant to go on a cruise until the situation is resolved and confidence restored. It might also mean some cruise ships are inactive for a while,” Mr Rollo says.As well as Carnival, the other company with most to lose is rival Royal Caribbean Cruises, whose Allure of the Seas is the world’s biggest cruise liner. Between them, Carnival and Royal Caribbean comprise 74 per cent of the cruise industry market.The size of their ships and variety of entertainment attracts families and other demographic groups younger than the traditional retired couples. According to Morgan Stanley, capacity has grown 30 per cent in the past five years, and Carnival expects to add a further 10 cruise ships by March 2016.While their US markets have remained strong, there has been some weakening in Europe caused by the Arab Spring, although Mr Ellis says the UK and German markets have proved resilient.“Trading has been pretty resilient, but they haven’t been able to pass on price rises caused by rises in fuel,” Mr Ellis says. While the cruise sector’s share of the holiday market is modest, it scores particularly highly on customer satisfaction ratings. “It is quite a big-ticket item, but a cruise trip is all-inclusive and offers relatively good value for money,” Mr Ellis says.Cruise operators will be relieved at the measured reaction of some of their lenders. Hans Kjelsrud, head of shipping for Sweden’s Nordea Bank, one of the world’s largest shipping banks, said the cruise industry had regularly proved itself to be “very resilient.”Cruise shipping has been one of the few bright spots in ship finance in the past few months, after the main shipping segments – container shipping, dry bulk and tankers – all suffered slumps in earnings because of overcapacity.Dagfinn Lunde, head of shipping for Germany’s DVB, another significant shipping bank, said his bank would continue lending to build new vessels.“There’s very good demand,” he said. “Accidents have happened over the years. It’s like an aeroplane going down – you don’t see people stopping flying.”Like any consumer industry, cruise operators were already braced for a difficult year and a slowdown in bookings. “Market conditions are challenging, we battle on,” says Roger Allard of All Leisure, the UK-listed cruise operator that runs ships of a much smaller size, such as Discovery, which has capacity for 650 passengers..“It’s very sad what has happened,” Mr Lunde adds. “It’s not going to affect cruising per se. If anything it will slow down new bookings, it might defer new cruisers to the market, but that happens in any unfortunate incident.”Additional reporting by Guy Dinmore in Rome……………………………………………………………..Connection to the islandGiuseppe Tievoli, 82-year-old father of Antonello Tievoli, a head waiter working on the Costa Concordia, said his son called on Friday to tell him they would be passing the island of Giglio, where the cruise liner foundered, Giulia Segreti reports from Rome.“Antonello called me when they left Civitavecchia on Friday and told me that around 9pm they would be passing by Giglio,” he told the Financial Times.“The ship always passed by Giglio. Sometimes it sounded its horn in a sign of saluting, if it was during the day. In particular when there was the old commander, who was originally from the island and had his whole family living on it.”“During the day it kept two or three miles away from the coast, maybe at night slightly less, but it was still a matter of miles.”“It is an old thing …back in the times when smaller ships came from Sardinia, wives and children of the sailors waited to say hi.”Investigators have been seeking to discover why the liner came so close to the island as it sailed up the Tuscan coast.
72;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-01-16T20:06:55Z;Life of leisure offers work opportunities;;One in every four people rescued from the stricken Costa Concordia was a crew member.The labour-intensive operation to keep more than 3,000 passengers wined, fed and above all amused on a cruise ship makes a six-month passage lucrative work for struggling singers, dancers, magicians and other entertainers.The scale of services offered by these giant vessels to cater for 3,800 berths makes them “not so much floating hotels as floating resorts”, says analyst Mark Brumby of Langton Capital.On Royal Caribbean’s 16-deck Allure of the Seas, the biggest in the world, more than two dozen dining choices compete with ice shows, aqua shows, parades, fitness centres, shops, cinemas, swimming pools and spas, a casino, climbing walls, a zip wire and a full-stage production of the musical Chicago to entertain up to 5,400 people. The whole structure weighs in at 225,000 tonnes.Linda JohnPierre is in rehearsals in Florida for the Chicago production before the Allure of the Seas begins a six-month stint taking passengers on regular week-long trips to destinations in the Caribbean. She is preparing for seven shows a week, which include singing in the musical, at the captain’s cocktail reception and in a 1970s set.“It is a different world,” says Ms JohnPierre. “For a guest, you can do as much as you want or as little as you want. It’s very luxurious and very leisurely.”Weekly prices range from $2,800 for a standard berth, up to $34,000 for the most prized suite.The striking difference between the cruises of a generation ago and today’s offering is the mix of younger people with the traditional senior citizens brigade, as cruise operators such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean widen the entertainment offering to lure families. Several ships are licensed for weddings to attract honeymoon-trippers.All of this has detracted from one of the mainstays of the traditional cruise trip – the opportunity for disembarkation at ports along the way. “People don’t get off,” says Ms JohnPierre. “Even if the boat stops off at a port, they prefer to stay on board.”For the staff, the only strict conditions are curfews for returning to the ship from port. The Allure of the Seas has a separate nightclub, English pub and gym reserved for staff only.But are these small comforts for a relentless tour of duty? “Halfway through my first trip, I thought it was a bit repetitive,” says Ms JohnPierre. “But it made me more grateful for doing the things I do. I’m quite lucky, I got bigger and better jobs.“You also get a case of sea legs, when you can’t walk properly on land. But by working at sea, if you can get work persistently, that’s the most important thing.”
73;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-01-15T23:01:19Z;Search continues for cruise ship survivors;;Rescue workers on Sunday freed a honeymooning South Korean couple who had been trapped in the Costa Concordia cruise liner that foundered off the Italian island of Giglio on Friday night, but the discovery of two elderly men in a submerged part of the vessel took the confirmed death toll to five.The search was continuing for at least 15 people possibly still missing among the 4,229 listed as having been on board. The 3,216 passengers were said to be mostly Italians but included some 20 nationalities. Two of the confirmed dead were French tourists.The 114,500-tonne vessel, built in Italy and launched in 2006, was operated by Costa Crociere, an Italian unit of Carnival, one of the world’s largest cruise companies. It had been sailing up the Tuscan coast towards Savona at the start of a cruise bound also for France and Spain.Analysts suggested the shipwreck could reduce Carnival’s profits by a 10th this year, with the longer-term impact harder to quantify.Costa Crociere said last night it was “deeply saddened” at the tragedy and that it was co-operating with investigators.“Preliminary indications are that there may have been significant human error on the part of the ship’s master, Captain Francesco Schettino. The route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore,” the company said.Francesco Schettino, Italian captain, was arrested on Saturday, accused of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship more than three hours before the last known survivors were taken off on Friday night, Italian prosecutors said. Speaking before his arrest, the captain said he and crew members were the last to have evacuated. He said the ship was “more or less” 300m off the island when it hit a rock that he said was not marked on charts. The weather was fair at the time.Francesco Verusio, prosecutor leading the investigation, said the captain had carried out a “clumsy manoeuvre” too close to the island, possibly 150m away. Despite their giant size – the Costa Concordia is almost 300m – some cruise ships are known to sail close to Giglio’s small harbour to give passengers and islanders a nice view.The ship’s black box has been recovered. Investigators are asking why the captain did not launch an SOS for about one hour after the ship first hit submerged rocks and started listing as it took on water. Passengers described scenes of panic and confusion after the initial impact that ripped a long gash in the hull. They were initially told there had been an “electrical fault”. Some swam to shore.Admiral Giampaolo Di Paola, defence minister, said the disaster had been caused by “gross human error”. Corrado Clini, environment minister, questioned whether such large ships, which he noted did not have double hulls, should be allowed to pass so close to land, especially inside a maritime reserve.The accident comes at the beginning of “wave season” between January and March when the most lucrative summer cruise bookings are made. Analysts said this period could account for about a third of all cruise bookings, and was often when the most profitable deals were arranged.Carnival, a dual-listed American-British company, operates over 100 ships with brands including P&O, Cunard and Princess Cruises. It accounts for almost 50 per cent of the global cruise market. The shares have already fallen almost 30 per cent in the past year, as the rising cost of fuel and the softening consumer sentiment have worried investors.The accident is likely to reignite concerns over whether safety regulations have kept pace with the growing size of cruise ships, the largest of which now carry twice as many passengers as just a decade ago.Clay Maitland, a veteran shipping lawyer who administers the Marshall Islands registry – the world’s third-largest ship registry – said it was time to speak out about the dangers of “gigantism”. The largest cruise ships afloat can carry 2,000 passengers more than the Costa Concordia.Mr Maitland said: “When you’re dealing with a ship that has thousands of people on it …if something goes wrong, how do you get all those people off?”The accident is also likely to fuel a debate – which had already been rekindled after the grounding of the container ship Rena off New Zealand in October – over standards of training for ships’ crews.Although cruise lines – which pay well compared with other shipping companies – can generally attract high-quality officers, Nautilus, the maritime officers’ union, questioned whether other crew members were well enough trained for evacuations.“While the core crew …are trained to high levels, the passenger staff, we believe, receive only minimal training,” Andrew Linington, Nautilus’s head of communications, said. “It’s a fraction of the safety training given to airline cabin crew.”Carnival, a dual-listed American-British company, operates more than 100 ships with brands including P&O, Cunard and Princess Cruises. It accounts for almost 50 per cent of the global cruise market.
74;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-01-15T18:27:09Z;Carnival Corporation;Operator faces similar pressures to any business exposed to discretionary spending;The foundering of Costa Concordia, the cruise liner, off Italy is unlikely to prompt a rethink of the industry model, predicated on filling ever bigger and more lavish vessels with ever greater numbers of passengers. However, the terrible loss of life and the chaotic evacuation of more than 4,000 passengers and crew from the ship suggests that the vaunted economies of scale of these floating resorts carry significant risks. The shipwreck does not necessarily make all cruise ships more dangerous, nor will it do for cruising what the fatal crash of a Concorde supersonic airliner did to another branch of high-end tourism. But these tourists are easily scared. In the short term, bookings could fall, hitting the liner operator’s London- and New York-listed parent Carnival Corporation (and its rivals), right in the peak booking season.Without the bookings cash flow and full berths, cruise ship operators will struggle to defray their soaring fixed costs and maintain capital expenditure. Carnival has been resilient enough in the financial crisis. But in the latest downturn, it faces similar pressures to any other business exposed to discretionary spending. Results for the year to last November show it: revenue rose by 9 per cent to $15.8bn, but net income fell by 3 per cent to $1.9bn. Fuel costs soared by 35 per cent, five times the pace of increase in its payroll costs.But the challenges are not only operational: Carnival, like its peers, pegs its hopes on growth in European passengers, who account for about 40 per cent of revenue. Now, with the region on its uppers, and the shipwreck on its doorstep, those hopes may be dashed. Carnival’s share price, down by 28 per cent year on year, has lagged behind the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index for fully five years. Yet the shares, trading on 13 times this year’s expected earnings, still do not fully factor in the risks that lie ahead of it on dry land.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
75;CCL;Carnival Corp;2012-01-15T18:04:03Z;Shipwreck could dent Carnival’s profits;;The shipwreck of one of Carnival Corp’s vessels off the coast of Italy over the weekend could wipe more than 10 per cent off this year’s profits at the world’s largest cruise ship operator by revenues, according to analysts.“There is never a good time for these things but this accident happens at a very bad time, at the start of the most active booking period,” said Terje Fatnes, analyst at Enskilda Securities.He estimates that the company, which had $1.91bn in net profit last year, could lose at least $200m because of the accident, which saw the €450m Costa Concordia capsize after running aground on rocks. This includes as much as $150m of lost earnings from the vessel and costs associated with the rescue and recovery operation.The accident, which has claimed at least 3 lives, comes at the beginning of “wave season” between January and March when analysts say a third of all cruise bookings are made, many of which are the industry’s most profitable deals.Mr Fatnes added that it was too early to calculate the longer term cost of any lawsuits and environmental damage, and difficult to gauge whether people would become more wary of booking cruises as a result. Much will depend on the results of the investigation into the accident.“We have seen many smaller accidents on cruise ships, but I can’t remember when we have had a capsized vessel with one of the big operators. It could have an impact going forward,” he said.Carnival, a dual-listed American-British company, operates more than 100 ships with brands including P&O, Cunard and Princess Cruises. It accounts for almost half of the global cruise market.The company is 47 per cent owned by Micky Arison, chief executive and son of the company’s founder, and the broader Arison family. It has lost 29 per cent in market value over the past year, amid investor worries about the rising cost of fuel and the softening consumer sentiment.Revenues rose 9.2 per cent to $15.8bn last year, but net income slipped 3.3 per cent as the rising cost of fuel wiped $535m off profits. Carnival was also hit by the geopolitical unrest in the Middle East and north Africa, which kept some passengers away from cruises in the region.Carnival shares, which closed at $34.28 on Friday, are expected to see sharp falls in London on Monday. The US stock market will be closed for Martin Luther King day.The company’s Genoa-based Costa Cruises business operates 15 ships and is Europe’s largest based on passengers and ship capacity. The last major incident for Costa Cruises was in November 2010, when an engine fire on board the Carnival Splendor, travelling from Long Beach to the Mexican Riviera, meant the vessel lost all electrical power and had to be towed back to shore.The extent to which Carnival’s insurance will cover the latest incident is unclear. The company has $90m in guarantees from insurers to cover non-performance of transportation, according to regulatory filings, and holds $130m in sterling denominated bonds to cover UK passenger’s deposit liabilities. It has protection for hull and machine damage, policies covering crew and passenger injuries, shipwrecks, damage to third parties and pollution.However, the company self-insures for part of these categories and does not carry any cover for loss of earnings or revenues from its ships.
76;CCL;Carnival Corp;2011-12-20T22:25:22Z;US data boost homebuilding stocks;;Homebuilders led a strong rally in US stocks as the S&P 500 enjoyed its best day so far in December.PulteGroup rose 10.4 per cent to $6.17, DR Horton was gaining 5.7 per cent to $12.43 and Lennar climbed 6.3 per cent to $19.68, as construction starts hit their highest level in a year in November.Home improvement retailers were boosted, with Masco rising 8.9 per cent to $9.82 and Home Depot adding 4.3 per cent to $41.93.Some analysts were cautious, however, noting that much of the rise was due to building works starting on apartment blocks, which hit a three-year high.“The report doesn’t signal any turn in fortunes for the lion’s share of the market – single family homes,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “Activity there rose by just 10,000 units to a 447,000 annualised pace and the highest in only five months.”Other analysts warned that Tuesday’s gains could be reversed by a change in sentiment, noting the high volatility of homebuilder stocks. All three large US homebuilders had fallen on Monday, in spite of a confidence survey rising to its highest level of the year.Broader markets bounced with the S&P 500 adding 3 per cent to 1,241.30 after its best day of the month. However, the benchmark US index remains in negative territory for December, traditionally one of its strongest months.The financial sector of the S&P 500 recovered ground after Monday’s sell-off. Bank of America climbed back above $5, a level that it had breached on Monday for the first time since 2009. BofA shares closed up 3.7 per cent to $5.17.Morgan Stanley climbed 4.5 per cent to $14.80 and Citigroup was up 4.6 per cent at $25.95.Jefferies surged 22.9 per cent to $14.50, its highest close since October, as the investment bank revealed quarterly earnings that were not as bad as expected.Profit fell to $63m, 23 per cent lower than last year, but many analysts had expected worse. The bank faced intense scrutiny of its exposure to eurozone sovereign bonds in November, but fees from investment advisory services rose year on year.“The results are better than expected but the share price reaction is overdone,” said Douglas Sipkin at Ticonderoga Securities.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 2.9 per cent to 12,103.43 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.2 per cent to 2,603.73.AT&T lagged behind the market, but was still up 1.3 per cent to $29.01, despite calling time on its attempt to acquire T Mobile USA.That was a fillip for its equipment suppliers. Juniper Networks climbed 8.9 per cent to $19.74 and F5 Networks was up 6.7 per cent to $109.39.“We believe this development is a short-term positive for equipment vendors,” said George Notter at Jefferies. “We believe that AT&T in recent months had significantly dialled back fourth-quarter spending in order to apply leverage in its fight with regulators.”Rival network Sprint Nextel also took cheer, closing up 9.3 per cent to $2.36.BlackBerry handset manufacturer Research In Motion suffered another day of heavy selling.Shares fell 2.9 per cent to $12.52, the latest losses apparently triggered by reports that as many as 5,000 of its PlayBook tablets had been stolen from a freight truck.CVS Caremark rose 8.9 per cent to $39.80. The pharmacy chain boosted its quarterly dividend to 16.25 cents a share from 12.5 cents a share.Eastman Chemical jumped 8.1 per cent to $38.70 after announcing it had broken ground on a new facility to produce acetate in China.Red Hat fell 8.9 per cent to $41.95 for the worst performance in the S&P 500. The open-source software company reported fiscal third-quarter billings that missed analysts’ estimates.Billings, a predictor of revenue, increased 23 per cent from a year earlier in the three months to the end of November.Cruise ship operator Carnival Corporation was one of the other five S&P 500 stocks to fall. Shares close down 0.2 per cent to $31.93 after Carnival lowered guidance for 2012 earnings.Zynga, the online social game developer, enjoyed its first day of gains since a $10bn IPO last week.Its shares were up 2.1 per cent to $9.24, still 76 cents below their debut price.In after-hours trading Oracle shares tumbled 10 per cent to $26.26, after the software reported quarterly earnings that missed analyst expectations. That knocked the S&P 500 futures by 5 points suggesting the benchmark index may open lower on Wednesday.
77;CCL;Carnival Corp;2011-09-20T21:25:34Z;Carnival gains from US ‘value’ cruise demand;;Strong demand from US consumers looking for a bargain cruise over a conventional packaged holiday helped to boost third-quarter profits at Carnival.The operator of P&O and Princess cruises reported a 2.2 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to $1.3bn (£828m) in the quarter as it experienced greater demand compared with the same period a year ago from its US patrons.“The increased importance that consumers are placing on value continues to drive demand,” said Micky Arison, chief executive of Carnival, which is headquartered in Miami and London and operates 101 ships.Strength in the US markets helped revenues rise 12 per cent to $5bn in the three months to August 31. Earnings per share climbed 4.3 per cent to $1.69, which was slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations.Outside the US, the results were less strong. Upheaval in the Middle East and north Africa affected business in its European, Asian and Australian operations.The company also suffered from the 47 per cent increase in the cost of fuel to $581m, which dragged operating margins down from 31 per cent to 28 per cent.Carnival struck a downbeat note in its full-year outlook. The company said that its fuel costs would continue to increase and that advanced bookings suggested that occupancy would be lower for the rest of 2011 and the first half of 2012 compared with a year ago.Nevertheless, shares in the company closed up 7 per cent at £21.45. Analysts said that investors’ sentiment was helped by an indication that share buy-backs might be on the horizon.“Reduced capital commitments due to the slower pace of our shipbuilding program, along with our strong balance sheet and solid investment grade credit ratings, leave us well positioned to opportunistically return cash to shareholders,” said Mr Arison.Earlier this year, the company spent $445m on a share buy-back. It declared a third-quarter dividend of 25 cents, up from 10 cents in the same period in 2010.In 2008 Carnival, which is the only company in the world to be included in both the S&P 500 index and the FTSE 100 index, suspended its dividend to shore up its balance sheet ahead of $3.5bn in capital expenditure.The results included a charge of 2 cents per share related to the sale of one of the companies’ ships.

The loss meant Bombardier was now likely to pick up the remainder of the upgrade work, which may generate up to £2bn over the life of the project, said analysts.The news put at risk management’s 2012 target of 10 per cent organic sales growth from the rail division. Tube infrastructure spending accounts for up to a fifth of the unit’s revenue, analysts estimated.Shares in Invensys closed lower by 2.5 per cent to 325½p.

BG’s 30 per cent stake in the well was worth about 118p per share, said CAI Cheuvreux.Arm Holdings fell 3.9 per cent to 560p following profit warnings from fellow chipmaker Micrel and Benchmark Electronics, the contract electronics manufacturer. Both companies cited inventory corrections among customers, while Micron also blamed disruption to the Japanese supply chain.Sentiment in Arm was also affected by Intel’s announcement of a new processor range aimed at the tablet market. But analysts said Intel had an uphill battle to win customers, given its late entry into a market already dominated by Arm designs.Smith & Nephew slipped by 2.2 per cent to 683½p after US peer Biomet said orthopaedics sales were flat in the quarter ending February, with demand for replacement hips and knees remaining sluggish.Punch Taverns lost 5.3 per cent to 75¼p after the pubs group wrote down the value of its fleet for the third consecutive year.The weaker oil price lifted travel companies to the top of the blue-chip risers. Carnival Corporation gained 4.7 per cent to £24.76, British Airways owner IAG took on 4.5 per cent to 225p and Tui Travel rose 1 per cent to 232½p.National Express added 4.5 per cent to 250p after the hedge fund Elliott Advisors said it had won the support of Spain’s Cosmen family to appoint three non-executive directors to the transport group’s board.

The Fed chairman said sustained higher oil prices “would represent a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability, particularly if they were to cause inflation expectations to become less well anchored”.He also gave no indication of any further measures to stimulate the economy, which some traders had been hoping for.Any positive sentiment was further dashed as oil prices spiked higher on concerns that the unrest sweeping across north Africa and the Middle East might spread to Saudi Arabia.In the first three trading sessions of last week, the S&P fell 2.8 per cent on similar concerns. These worries damped risk appetite in the US and around the world, causing material stocks to dive lower.Titanium Metals was down 6.2 per cent to $17.82 while AK Steel was 4.7 per cent lower at $15.23. The S&P materials sector was down 2.3 per cent.Consumer services stocks were also depressed by the higher oil price and comments by Mr Bernanke.Carnival, the world’s largest cruise ship operator, was down 6.1 per cent to $40.08 while Priceline.com, the online travel company, lost 1.9 per cent to $445.29.But promising economic data helped limit the losses on Wall Street.Figures from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the US manufacturing sector had seen strong growth in February.The index rose from 60.8 in January to 61, which is the highest reading since 2004. A number over 50 on the index indicates that the sector is growing.In earnings news, AutoZone, a retailer of car parts, reported earnings up 20 per cent and same-store sales up by 7.1 per cent. The stock added 2.2 per cent to $263.52.But that failed to lift related stocks. O’Reilly Automotive was down 0.8 per cent to $55.15 while Advance Auto Parts was 0.1 per cent lower at $62.63.There were some signs that the tide might be turning for car part retailers, which have profited since the financial crisis on people’s reluctance to buy new cars.General Motors reported that its sales had jumped 46 per cent in February from the same period a year ago due, primarily to a rise in demand from retail customers.The Buick and Cadillac car brands reported sales up by 73 per cent and 70 per cent, respectively.GM shares were down 1.7 per cent to $32.95, however, as the sales figures failed to impress investors.Separately, Ford reported that its sales had risen 14 per cent. Its stock was 2.6 per cent lower at $14.66.Elsewhere, Las Vegas Sands, the casino resort company, fell 6.3 per cent to $43.70 after reporting that it was being investigated by the SEC and the Department of Justice over its compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Lorillard, which primarily makes menthol cigarettes, was up 1.6 per cent to $78.98 after the US Food and Drugs Agency said evidence was “insufficient” that smoking menthol cigarettes is riskier than normal cigarettes.Tower Group, the insurance provider, was down 12.6 per cent to $23.76 after its 2011 earnings view fell short of analyst estimates.Sonus Networks was up 33.3 per cent to $4.16 after the internet telecoms company reported fourth-quarter profit up 11 per cent and issued a revenue guidance that surpassed expectations.

It estimated that every 10 per cent change in the oil price affected Carnival’s earnings by 7-8 per cent.Meanwhile, traders noted sales by Carnival directors after their performance bonuses paid out. Former group chief executive Peter Ratcliffe and UK head David Dingle were among the board members to sell in recent days.The wider market fell for a fourth straight day, its longest losing streak since August. The FTSE 100 closed down 73.23 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 5,923.53.Miners led falls as inflation fears sent copper to a four-week low. Antofagasta lost 5.1 per cent to £13.13 and Xstrata slid 4.4 per cent to £13.47.Rexam led the Footsie fallers, down 5.8 per cent to 348½p on profit taking after the packaging maker delivered in-line results and confirmation that it would sell its lid-making business.

Autonomy fell 3.4 per cent to £16 and Sage declined by 0.6 per cent to 280½p.Arm Holdings lost 1.5 per cent to 577½p to profit taking after semiconductor industry data unexpectedly showed equipment sales falling in January.Logica lost 5.4 per cent to 137½p after it said 2011 earnings would be weighted towards the second half due to restructuring costs. The IT services group’s full-year results were otherwise in line with expectations, which disappointed some in the wake of strong numbers last week from larger rival CapGemini.Amec led a shortlist of blue-chip risers, up 0.9 per cent to £11.38, after Australian oil services peer WorleyParsons reported a much improved order book.Otherwise, defensive sectors were in vogue. Imperial Tobacco edged up 0.5 per cent to £20.01, BSkyB took on 0.5 per cent at 757½p and perennial bid candidate Scottish & Southern Energy rose 0.2 per cent to £14.60.C&W Communications rallied by 6.2 per cent to 49¼p after the telecoms group began a $100m share buy-back after selling most of its Bermuda business for $70m. Analysts said the deal may herald larger asset sales that would help the company secure its dividend payment, which was not covered by earnings.Ahead of full-year earnings, Bodycote was up 0.8 per cent to 298¾p. RBS said it expected a positive outlook statement from the engineer, particularly for markets such as heavy trucks. Sector peer Kier Group, which was also due to post results on Thursday, added 2.9 per cent to £12.79.Bus and train operator Go-Ahead rose 3.8 per cent to £14.60 on the back of post-results “buy” advice from brokers including Liberum Capital.A downgrade to “hold” sent Tate & Lyle down 1 per cent to 558½p. The shares are up 37 per cent in a year yet restructuring is only at the halfway point, with T&L still some way off being considered a pure-play ingredients company, Citi said.
81;CCL;Carnival Corp;2011-02-22T20:29:04Z;BAE leads London fallers as defence fears bite;;BAE Systems led the FTSE 100 fallers amid rising concern over defence spending.Shares in the defence contractor dropped 4.3 per cent to 326¾p, the sharpest fall since April, amid fears that unrest in Libya could spill over to Saudi Arabia.The Kingdom represented 12 per cent of BAE’s group sales in 2009, largely in the high-margin area of jet fleet support, said Citigroup.However, the broker also argued that BAE’s relationship with Saudi Arabia was based on government-to-government contracts dating back to the 1960s. “This is not a fly-by-night operation, nor one that is heavily predicated on speculative equipment sales,” it said.Citi also played down the impact of deeper cuts to UK spending after a report from the UK’s Public Accounts Committee said financial mismanagement had created a £38bn hole in the Ministry of Defence’s budget. “It is worth remembering the UK represents just 20 per cent of sales for BAE,” it said. “While we see the environment in the UK as remaining tough, we do not see today’s reports as incrementally new.”Separately, BAE’s house broker UBS cut its 2012 and 2013 earnings forecasts to reflect margin pressure and weakening sales for its land and armaments division.“We continue to believe stock performance could be dull in 2011,” UBS told clients. “With government deficits likely to continue to be an issue for stock markets in 2011, we believe BAE may continue to trade on the low multiples through 2011 it has been trading on for the past two years.”The wider market recovered from lows as Wall Street staged a mid-session rally that many traders struggled to explain.The FTSE 100 bounced off a session low of 5,926.55 to close at 5,996.76, down 18.04 points, or 0.3 per cent.Royal Bank of Scotlandled the way with a 2.3 per cent rise to 47¾p ahead of results on Thursday.Schroders gained 1.4 per cent to £17.61 after Deutsche Bank advised clients to buy ahead of the fund manager’s results, due in early March.Shares in Schroders have been under pressure after concerns that cash was being pulled from emerging market equity funds, Deutsche said.However, it argued that the cash was being reinvested in developed market funds, which represent between 77 per cent and 87 per cent of Schroders’ total equity assets under management.“Overall, we expect Schroders to be a net beneficiary of rotation out of emerging market equities,” it said.A sharp fall in cotton prices helped to underpin retailers.Next was up 1.1 per cent to £20.03 and after UBS added the stock to its “buy” list.Next has been passing on higher costs to customers, which makes it a relatively safe investment when compared with rivals such as H&M that have held their prices to chase market share, UBS said.The rising oil price lifted producers and weighed on consumers. Carnival Corporation was lower by 1.7 per cent to £27.60 and British Airways owner IAG off 0.5 per cent to 238¼p, while Royal Dutch ShellB shares rose 0.9 per cent to £21.81.BHP Billitongained 1.6 per cent to £24.13 after announcing the $4.75bn purchase of shale gas fields in Arkansas.“This acquisition begins to build a position in shale gas, will further diversify the business, and will partially cool the heated speculation of a larger on-market M&A oil deal being in the pipeline,” said UBS.Lamprell, the oilfield engineer, jumped 8.9 per cent to 305p after winning an order from Greatship Global Energy Services to build a new drilling rig.Croda led the mid-cap risers, up 9.7 per cent to £16.39, after full-year results from the chemicals maker beat expectations.Advertising agency Aegislost 2.7 per cent to 142½p on news that it would book a £25m charge to cover the collapse of a former client, the Spanish conglomerate Nueva Rumasa.Aegis added that its 2010 earnings would otherwise be in line with consensus estimates, a mild disappointment after peers such as Publicis beat sales growth forecasts.
82;CCL;Carnival Corp;2011-01-21T22:03:43Z;Rulers of the waves;;Three immense ships met in the bay of New York last week for a rendezvous full of pride, irony, poignancy and beauty. Massive and glittering they lay there as night fell upon a snowy Manhattan They were supervised across the water by the Statue of Liberty itself, and the city spectacularly feted them.The Empire State Building was floodlit red in their honour and the wide bay was speckled all over with lights – lights on bobbing buoys, lights on firefloats ceremonially spouting, lights on tugs, on ferries, on sightseeing craft, lights on helicopters circling above, the steady monumental light held high in Liberty’s torch. As the three vessels moved stately and slow into line ahead, a vast flurry of fireworks lit up the horizons, from Hoboken to Sandy Hook.It was a marvellous publicity display but it was also a genuinely historical spectacle. There at the very gateway of America, where so many ships before them had brought the huddled masses of Europe to breathe free – there those three behemoths richly and showily lay, Manhattan style, as to the manner born.For they were the three Queens of the Cunard Line – the Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mary 2 and the Queen Victoria, and although they had never met in New York before, their hereditary association with the city was profound. They were the latest and largest of the Cunard Line’s Queen ships, which for half a century dominated the Atlantic passenger trade, and which during the second world war played an allegorical part in the victorious Anglo-American alliance.During the war, the two earliest Queens, the first Queen Mary (launched in 1936) and the first Queen Elizabeth (1938), used their size and speed to defy the U-boats and maintain their own supply line between America and Britain, sailing independently of plodding convoys. They became so familiar to New Yorkers, and to the millions of American soldiers they carried, that when they steamed storm-tossed, battle-scarred and grimly camouflaged through the Narrows into this same bay of New York, they seemed true symbols of Churchill’s indomitable Britain.So yes, pride of heritage certainly emanated from the three great vessels lying out there, with the launches and tugs and speedboats circling around them in homage, and their festive lights lordly in the dark. The Cunard publicists called their meeting a Royal Rendezvous, and the ships themselves are replete with monarchism and Britishness.Mind you, the three of them are not entirely British thoroughbreds, like those heroic Cunard Queens of old. For a start they were not built, as their predecessors had been, on the Clyde. The Victoria and Elizabeth were built in Italy, the Mary, ironically enough, was built at the very same yards at San Nazaire that had built, 70 years before, the supreme rival of their forerunners, the utterly French Normandie.Grandly as they lie there beneath the skyscrapers, they do not look altogether pure-bred either. This is because, in fact, they are functional hybrids. Their dazzling style suits Manhattan but the Queen Victoria did not seem half so patrician when I saw her in Venice a couple of years ago. She seemed out of scale then, out of sympathy, looming vastly over the ancient quays with a touch of the nouvelle riche to her passage among the prodigies.The truth is that only one of those three ships, the Queen Mary 2, is a real ocean liner, in the sense that their illustrious forebears were. Who needs ocean liners now? The Mary 2 is the very last vessel to offer a regular express passenger service across the North Atlantic, and even she, the flagship of the line, spends much of her time as a cruise ship.Her two sisters are entirely pleasure craft, among the greatest of them all, and this has inevitably cheapened their silhouettes. Stacked high as they are with swimming pools, spas, casinos, croquet lawns, theatres and such, their massed cabins all with their own balconies, at a glance they look more like slab-sided container ships than the Ocean Greyhounds of tradition.They fly the Red Ensign as Cunarders always have but their ultimate owner is the Carnival Corporation, a multinational that controls half the world’s cruise ships, and many of its cruise companies. It is many a long year since Cunard’s headquarters were on the waterfront at Liverpool – the home port of the Queen Mary 2 is Brooklyn.As for poignancy, well, to my mind there is always something poignant to the presence of great ships because they seldom live for very long and, in their decline, often sail into pathos. Most of us will certainly outlive those three majestic vessels of the Royal Rendezvous and I, myself, have witnessed all of their tremendous predecessors in their sunset years.The original Queen Mary, the first of them, can still be seen in her final degradation, berthed permanently (economic conditions allowing) as a hotel and tourist attraction at Long Beach California – her three great Cunard funnels still spick and span but her interiors touristically transformed. I twice encountered her noble wartime comrade, the original Queen Elizabeth: once limping sadly out of New York, rusted and unloved in her old age, and once lying upside-down and burnt-out in the harbour of Hong Kong, whence bits of her hull went into landfill for the construction of the nearby airport.And, year after year, wherever I wandered, I used to come across the Queen Elizabeth 2, familiar to the whole world as the QE2. For my tastes she was the most elegant of them all, the real thing, the last of her kind, Clyde-built but destined, after 40 years of beloved vicissitudes, to end up today in a Dubai limbo, waiting to be converted into something else.That accounts for them all. There have only been six Cunard Queens. In their day they have all been the very latest thing – the biggest or the fastest, the most expensive, the most epic, and in the idea if not always in the substance, the most beautiful among their peers.And when those three brave ships of today, their rendezvous fulfilled, sailed away from New York in the blaze of fireworks, the moment was certainly beautiful to experience. This event also had a historical resonance all its own. I really do doubt if its particular ambivalent grandeur can ever be repeated. On the one hand it possessed the beauty of remembrance, because it evoked such grand echoes of the past, when within human memory merchant ships played a more majestic part in the lives of the nations – seeing those ships slip out to sea summoned in my mind all manner of folk-memories, folk-prides, that later generations can never know. On the other hand, it was an event instinct with the beauty of change and modernity.For those ships were not like the old ships. They were far bigger than anything our fathers thrilled to – and they sailed into the dusk more like floating cities than instruments of transport. They were, as Le Corbusier said of his houses, living machines – complete vast floating communities with a population of thousands, equipped with every adjunct of contemporary living, huge, powerful, tremendously purposeful if only for pleasure, profit and frivolity.As they sailed out to sea at the turn of the year, while the fireworks died down behind them, the Manhattan revellers went home and Liberty was left alone with her torch upon her islet, the Cunard captains of old must surely have been proud and excited to know that one of those three mighty vessels, the Queen Victoria, was commanded by a woman, Captain Inger Klein Olsen, who was born in that nursery of hardy seafarers, the Faroe Islands.On my flight home that week – honestly! – I came across a passage from Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra. “Let Neptune hear,” it said, “we bid a loud farewell to those great fellows”, and it was followed by a stage direction: sound a flourish, with drums.‘Manhattan ’45’ (Faber) by Jan Morris has just been republished……………………………………………DetailsJan Morris travelled with Continental Airlines (www.continental.com) which flies direct to New York from more than 140 airports worldwide. Return fares to New York cost from £462 from Manchester and £444 from London Heathrow.In Manhattan, Jan Morris stayed at the Mandarin Oriental (www.mandarinoriental.com/newyork) which has double rooms from $829 including breakfast.……………………………………………Ship shapes: Titanic dwarfed by new leviathansThe biggest cruise ships ever built are the new Allure of the Seas and its sister ship, Oasis of the Seas, writes Susannah Butter. Launched last month by Royal Caribbean, Allure is 361m long, weighs 225,282 tonnes and can carry 5,400 passengers. Allure cost Royal Caribbean $1.5bn to build and has an onboard park with 12,000 trees and plants.Oasis was launched a year earlier and these two floating leviathans are just the latest entrants in what, in recent years, has become a highly competitive race to produce ever bigger and better cruise ships. Both of these ships are 40 per cent bigger than the previous title holders, Royal Caribbean’s Freedom-class trio.In 1912, the Titanic was the largest vessel in the world at 46,328 gross register tonnes, with capacity for 3,547 passengers and crew. She boasted an onboard swimming pool, a Turkish bath and electric lights. In 1969, when she made her maiden voyage, the QE2 was thought huge at 70,327 tonnes.The Allure is nearly five times the size of the Titanic, three times the size of the QE2 and about 10 times the size of the Ark Royal, the British navy’s biggest ship (although military and leisure ships are measured in different ways).The routes of these giant new liners are determined by their dimensions. They can’t dock in any European port because they require custom-made facilities that can manage the mooring requirements of their tonnage and can cope with the disembarkation of up to 6,000 people. Royal Caribbean has built mega-piers for them at Fort Lauderdale in Florida, Haiti and the Bahamas.Prices for a seven-night western Caribbean cruise on the Oasis start at £625 per person based on two sharing and rise to £16,659 staying in a suite with baby grand piano. A seven-night eastern Caribbean cruise on the Allure starts at £633 per person.
83;CCL;Carnival Corp;2010-09-21T21:01:54Z;S&P retreats after Fed stance rattles investors;;US stocks finished an afternoon of choppy trading lower as the Federal Reserve said that it was prepared to take action to bolster the economic recovery but did not announce further quantitative easing.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,139.78, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to close at 10,761.03 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent lower at 2,349.35.Shares, which had been lower before the Fed’s announcement, briefly rallied afterwards, before losing ground.The market had broken through the critical 1,130 level on Monday partly on the back of speculation that the Fed would introduce further measures to spur the economic recovery.The Federal Open Market Committee also decided to keep fund rates steady and said that, if needed, it would take action to return inflation over time to levels consistent with its mandate. “They rattled the sabres pretty heavily this time particularly the bit where they said they saw inflation below what is consistent with its mandate, which suggests that further quantitative easing is coming but not this time,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.“I think they’ll provide additional accommodation further down the line – at the minimum after the election. But they’ll wait and see how the economic indicators come in. At the moment they are trending towards improvement so they could still shift enough to reassure.”Most sectors finished the day down, but the industrials index closed up 0.1 per cent. The dollar, lower after the Fed’s decision, could help export-driven industrials.Before the opening bell, a report showed builders started construction on more houses than expected and permits for future construction also rose.Housing starts climbed to a four-month high, suggesting the housing market could be starting to stabilise after the end of homebuyer tax credit.Analysts had expected construction to start on 550,000 houses, but it actually started on 598,000 units, on a seasonally adjusted basis.The S&P 500 homebuilders index initially rallied but later edged lower as some analysts were concerned that the rise was mainly due to a jump in the number of multi-family properties being built, a much more volatile figure than single-family housing.The homebuilders index ended the session lower by 0.7 per cent, with DR Horton losing 0.6 per cent to $10.98 and Pulte Group falling 1.6 per cent to $8.52.Elsewhere, the S&P 500 financials index led the fallers, down 1 per cent. Morgan Stanley retreated by 2.9 per cent to $26.06.M&T Bank fell 2.5 per cent to $88.69 after it was reported that it may give a majority stake to Banco Santander when it merges with the Spanish bank’s US unit. US-listed shares in Banco Santander nudged up 0.2 per cent to $12.90.Shares in travel companies from cruise liners to air carriers rose. Carnival Corp, the world’s largest cruise company, reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings as sales climbed 6.9 per cent. Net income was $1.62 per share and the company forecast full year earnings above current expectations, of between $2.48 and $2.52 a share. Its shares were up 1.4 per cent to $37.57, after rising as much as 3 per cent earlier in the session.Airlines were lifted by an announcement by International Air Travel Association that carriers were likely to post sharply higher 2010 profits than previously forecast, even though the association also warned that 2011 could be disappointing.United Airlines’ holding company UAL Corp advanced 4.8 per cent to $23.50, Continental Airlines was boosted by 4.9 per cent to $24.66 and AMR Corporation, parent company of American Airlines, climbed 3.6 per cent to $6.88.Hewlett-Packard said it had resolved its differences with Oracle in their dispute over the appointment of Mark Hurd, former HP chief executive, as co-president of Oracle, and reaffirmed the partnership between the two companies.HP rose 1.4 per cent to $39.92 while Oracle fell 2.4 per cent to $26.82.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
85;CCL;Carnival Corp;2010-07-19T08:34:29Z;Cruising;Europe is the emerging market of the cruise ship world;Europe’s seas are filled with American hand-me-downs. Last year, US cruise ship Celebrity Galaxy became the rather more functional Mein Schiff (My Ship) and started carrying Germans around the Baltic. Celebrity Mercury will join it next year as Mein Schiff II. The redeployments are emblematic of the industry’s conviction that Europe is the emerging market of the cruise ship world. Royal Caribbean bought Spanish company Pullmantur in 2006 and launched a joint German venture with Tui AG two years later. Last year Carnival acquired full control of its joint venture, Iberocruceros. But their faith in the continent is about to be tested.Enthusiasts say it is underdeveloped (only 1 per cent of Europeans went on a cruise last year, compared with 3 per cent of Americans) and point to robust growth. Passenger numbers rose an average 12 per cent each year over the past five years, compared with about 2 per cent in North America. But this is a daft measure of demand. Because fixed costs are so high, operators will always fill their ships to the brim – the question is at what price. Passenger numbers rose globally last year, for example, but ticket prices were slashed as recession hit demand. Yields – revenue per berth per day – fell about 15 per cent.The problem is that operators change direction no more quickly than cruise ships themselves. New vessels are ordered two to four years in advance and even redeployments take a year or two. So net capacity will continue to expand in Europe (by 8 per cent this year and 7 per cent next year, according to UBS estimates) regardless of demand, which could suffer as the continent enters an “age of austerity” with job losses, benefit cuts and higher taxes. Investors in the two listed operators do not seem worried: Royal Caribbean and Carnival trade at 12 and 13 times this year’s expected earnings, respectively – a shade below their average five-year price/earnings ratios. That won’t last if the industry’s emerging market becomes a submerging one.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

Pulte Group was down 3.2 per cent to $8.86, Toll Brothers fell 3.2 per cent to $17.06 and DR Horton lost 3 per cent to $10.22. Home Depot, a home improvement retail chain, dropped 2.6 per cent to $30.61.Walgreen lost 6.5 per cent to $28.17 as the drugstore chain posted a fiscal third-quarter profit of 53 cents per share excluding some items, falling short of the 58 cent per share average analyst estimate.Rival Rite Aid fell 2.9 per cent to $1.01 and CVS Caremark declined 1.2 per cent to $31.40.Intel fell 1 per cent to $20.98 even as the company and the Federal Trade Commission indicated that they may soon reach an out-of-court settlement on an antitrust case, filing a joint motion to suspend administrative trial proceedings until July 22.If the agreement is accepted, it will head off a September trial that would have likely put the spotlight on Intel’s relationships with Dell, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.Apple led the technology stocks higher as the company announced that it had sold 3m iPads in 80 days, sending its stock 1.4 per cent higher to $273.85.The stock’s target price estimate was raised to $375 from $350 at Deutsche Bank. The broker said that demand for iPhones and iPods had exceeded its expectations.Petsmart was 0.4 per cent lower at $31.55 as the pet-store chain announced plans to buy back $400m worth of its shares. It will also increase its quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents per share from 10 cents per share.Patriot Coal Corp lost 16.8 per cent to $13.48 as the coal producer said it is permanently closing its Harris Number 1 mine near Wharton, West Virginia.US-listed shares in Carnival Corp dropped 4.5 per cent to $33.19 as the cruise ship operator said third-quarter earnings would be as low as $1.43 per share. Analysts on average had forecast earnings of $1.51 per share.The company’s second-quarter results beat its prior forecasts, with net income of 32 cents per share, against 33 cents per share a year ago. It predicted in March second-quarter earnings would be between 26 and 30 cents.Jefferies Group rose 5.7 per cent to $24.17 after the New York-based securities firm that specialises in mid-sized companies posted second-quarter net income of $85m, or 41 cents per share. The consensus was for a profit of 34 cents a share.Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, fell 3 per cent to $64.11 even as James Owens, its chief executive, said its revenue would increase 25 per cent this year. The company also expected its exports to jump 65 per cent.Analysts said that the stock had risen 17.6 per cent over the past two weeks, suggesting that the good news was priced in.Big Lots, a close-out retail chain, was down 8 per cent to $31.56 after the stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “overweight” at JPMorgan.Rival discounter Family Dollar Stores declined 1.5 per cent to $38.45.

The FTSE 100 held on to a 21-month high, up 0.1 per cent, or 7.51 points, to 5,650.13. That gave the index a 0.4 per cent gain for the week.Financial stocks set the pace on Friday after Lloyds Banking Group said it should turn a profit in 2010.Lloyds surged 8.2 per cent to 60p and Barclays gained 1.3 per cent to 357½p. Royal Bank of Scotland, which was hosting a seminar on its corporate arm, added 4.7 per cent to 44p.Old Mutual gained 1.2 per cent to 126½p, helped by Goldman Sachs raising its target price to 145p.On its final day before relegation from the Footsie, and ahead of results on Wednesday, Resolution gained 1 per cent to 74p.Deutsche Bank argued that Resolution’s numbers should cast “a spotlight on an unreasonably cheap valuation,” with the broker putting a 100p standalone valuation on the stock or 90p if management can find something to buy.Man Group, which has a trading update on Wednesday, rallied 1.3 per cent to 244p following several broker downgrades earlier in the week. JPMorgan argued that, with forecasts already cut, the chances of a negative surprise in the update were lessened.JPMorgan also dismissed concerns Man will cut its dividend, which currently promises a yield of about 12 per cent. While cutting the pay-out would make little difference to the company, it would send a downbeat message on earnings growth that management normally avoid, it argued.Airline engineers gained after Boeing said it would increase production to meet recovering demand. Smiths Group rose 2.3 per cent to £11.00 ahead of results next week, while Rolls-Royce rose 2.2 per cent to 601p.BAE Systems jumped 2.4 per cent to 385½p, a move dealers said likely reflected a squeeze related to the day’s options expiry.Miners and oil companies led the fallers following an unexpected interest rate hike in India.Vedanta Resources, India’s largest copper miner, was down 3.1 per cent to £26.22, while Rajasthan-focused Cairn Energy lost 2.6 per cent to 384p.Xstrata was 2.3 per cent weaker at £11.43 after chief executive Mick Davis sold £5.4m shares to pay a tax bill.BHP Billiton drifted 1 per cent to £21.85 amid a second day of speculation about potential oil acquisitions. BG Group, up 1 per cent to £12.02½, was once again connected to the rumour, along with smaller targets such as Australia’s Woodside Petroleum.Among the mid-caps, Game Group rose 3.5 per cent to 100p as Collins Stewart issued “buy” advice based on results from US peer Gamestop. Game shares have jumped 25 per cent in two weeks, helped by bid speculation.Mitchells & Butlers, due to announce a strategy review on Wednesday, was 1.3 per cent higher at 291p. Deutsche Bank expected an accelerated disposal programme, opening up the possibility of a special dividend, and saw potential for debt to be paid off via a sale and lease-back of unsecuritised pubs.Integrated Asset Management will be in focus on Monday morning.Just as the market closed on Friday night, the fund management group announced a tie-up with JRJ Group, an investment group started by Jeremy Isaacs, the former European head of Lehman Brothers, and Roger Nagioff, another former Lehman executive.Under the terms of the deal, Integrated and its partners have agreed to invest at least $15m in the JRJ subsidiary that controls Marex, one of the top brokers on the London Metal Exchange.In return, JRJ has said it will subscribe for a 10.6 per cent stake in Integrated at 33p a share. Integrated was flat at 24¾p.Stockbroker Collins Stewart rose 4.6 per cent to 79p amid takeover rumours. Analysts said bid speculation could not be ruled out because Collins Stewart is cheap and trades at a discount to its peers, with Nomura or Macquarie flagged as possible buyers.In addition, traders said Arden Partners had cleared an overhang, placing about 8m shares for a client with several institutions.Gulfsands Petroleum added 1.7 per cent to 318p after the Syrian-focused exploration group rejected a takeover approach of 350p a share from an Indian oil company. Collins Stewart said Gulfsands would be worth 400p a share if the company announced a reserve upgrade alongside its forthcoming results.Delta rose 2 per cent to 194¼p on talk that hedge funds now have a big enough position to block the 185p-a-share bid from Valmont.
89;CCL;Carnival Corp;2009-06-18T20:31:58Z;Wall Street rises as recession fears subside;;US stocks made gains on Thursday following three successive sessions of losses as fresh data indicated the recession was closer to ending than expected.Data on jobless claims, manufacturing in the Philadelphia region and leading economic indicators all helped spark a modest rally despite early concerns over the effect of new proposals on financial regulation.Futures spent most of the pre-market session flat as investors waited to see how Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, would be received when he addressed Congress on the new rules.They then received a boost on the release of figures showing that the number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits unexpectedly fell two weeks ago for the first time since January 3.The markets fell into negative territory soon after the market opened, though, as investors sold stock in General Electric, one of the companies likely to be classed as “systemically important” and so subject to much stricter oversight under the proposed legislation.The oversight would affect even GE’s non-financial businesses, leading to speculation it might spin off its financial arm rather than face the burden of heavy regulation. The shares fell 1.5 per cent to $11.97.But stocks in other sectors responded more positively to the plans, which analysts said could moderate the risk faced by many investors.“Reducing the risk investors face is a way of keeping Wall Street as a major financial competitive advantage for the US,” said David Darst, chief investment strategist for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.Financial stocks performed especially well, with Bank of America gaining 4.9 per cent to $12.90 and JPMorgan picking up 4.4 per cent to $34.17.The sector was also boosted by data showing that leading economic indicators are improving faster than expected and that the deceleration in Philadelphia’s manufacturing industry had slowed dramatically. This helped financial stocks lift markets out of negative territory during the morning. “The markets are particularly sensitive to economic reports right now as people decide whether to send them higher or lower,” said Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.8 per cent up at 918.37 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 8,555.60. The Nasdaq Composite index slipped a fraction to 1,807.72, however.The travel sector was under the microscope as investors reacted to results from cruise line operator Carnival and bearish words from two global airlines.UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, said traffic in the second quarter was expected to fall as much as 10.5 per cent compared with a year ago. That knocked the shares 4 per cent down to $3.82.The negativity surrounding the sector was reinforced by Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, who said the airline industry was yet to feel the worst of the downturn.Other carriers also fell. AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, lost 4.4 per cent to $4.38 and Delta Air Lines dropped 3.2 per cent to $5.98.Shares in Carnival rose after the company said that lower costs helped its profits beat Wall Street’s estimates.The company has suffered a bruising early summer on fears that swine flu would stop people travelling, but managed to outstrip the market’s expectations, sending the shares up 7.5 per cent to $24.77.Meanwhile, JM Smucker, which makes jam, showed rare growth in the consumer sector after reporting rising profits. Sales rose, helped by its purchase of the Folgers coffee business, and the shares climbed 9.7 per cent to $47.86.In the financial sector, Discover Financial Services made a surprise profit for the quarter after a successful antitrust lawsuit against Visa and Mastercard helped cushion rising loan losses. The shares gained 4 per cent to $9.27.Sallie Mae, the student loan provider, rose 5.5 per cent to $8.11 on news that it was one of the companies to which the Department of Education awarded a contract to service its $550m loan portfolio.
90;CCL;Carnival Corp;2009-04-27T20:34:27Z;Wall Street fluctuates on swine flu concerns;;US equities fell on Monday as investors worried about the effects of a potential swine flu pandemic.Many companies fluctuated during the session as Wall Street moved to reflect which sectors could lose and which could benefit from an outbreak after the virus reached New York.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, slumped 13.3 per cent to $4.70, while Delta Air Lines fell 14.3 per cent to $6.75. Investors were worried that travel would be the first industry to suffer if the flu continued to spread, and the Bloomberg US Airlines index suffered its heaviest intra-day fall since the session after the September 11 attacks.Tourism companies also suffered. Marriott, the hotel chain, dropped 5.1 per cent to $21.17 and Expedia, the online travel agency, fell 6.3 per cent to $10.53. Carnival, the cruise operator, lost 13.5 per cent to $24.59.Du Pont, which manufactures chemicals for the agricultural industry, led the materials sector lower amid worries about how the outbreak could affect farming. Its shares dropped 4.5 per cent to $27.50.Even credit card companies suffered because of the flu scare, as JPMorgan warned “cross-border fees may suffer from reduced cross-border travel related to the virus”. Visa lost 2.5 per cent to $58.87 and Mastercard retreated 4.4 per cent to $165.55.But Gilead Sciences, the drug company that developed the flu drug Tamiflu, and continues to receive royalties for its sales from Roche, the European company to whom it sold the licence, gained 3.8 per cent to $47.53.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent down at 857.51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.6 per cent lower at 8,025 points and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 1,679.41 points.The market briefly rallied during the morning, but later fell back, despite some analysts saying the selling was overdone. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Investors overreacted during the outbreaks of Sars and bird flu, and we saw that again this morning, as traders shot first and asked questions later.”Lawrence Summers, the chief White House economics adviser, also dented confidence when he told Fox News on Sunday that the US economy would experience “sharp declines in employment for quite some time this year”.Fears that global demand could still be some way from returning hit metals prices, and industrial companies suffered as a result. Freeport McMoRan the copper miner, lost 3.1 per cent to $39.68, while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, gave up 3.8 per cent to $8.79.The macro-economic news overshadowed earnings announcements from several leading companies, including Verizon the second-largest US telecoms company by market value, which beat analysts’ expectations, as it attracted more new customers than expected. But with revenues from business customers continuing to fall, the company’s shares lost 1.5 per cent to $30.54.Elsewhere in the sector, Qualcomm, which makes microchips for mobile phones, disappointed with its first-quarter earnings, but the company gained ground after raising its full-year revenue targets on signs that the market could be improving. Its shares picked up 4.4 per cent to $43.17.Humana, the health insurer, jumped 6.9 per cent to $29.25 after reporting a surge in first-quarter profits, easily exceeding Wall Street’s expectations and allowing it to raise its outlook for full-year profits.Corning, which makes glass for televisions, also beat analysts’ predictions, as the company said demand for its products was improving. Its shares gained 3.3 per cent to $15.84.General Motors was the strongest performer of the morning after it said it would make deep cuts to its plants and workforce and eliminate the Pontiac brand. The company also asked its bondholders to swap $27bn of debt for equity. Its shares surged 20.7 per cent to $2.04.“We didn’t see the sell-off that the pre-market session indicated,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “We’ve lived through 18 months of intense pressure after the financial collapse and we realised this flue outbreak does feel like the next wave.”
91;CCL;Carnival Corp;2009-03-24T19:39:24Z;Carnival outlook down on discounts;;Carnival, the world's largest cruise ship operator, has underscored the tough trading conditions in the leisure sector after being forced to cut its full-year outlook because of offering sharp discounts to fill its ships.The company, listed in New York and London, has reduced the 2009 guidance for its earnings per share to $2.10 to $2.30, compared with its previous expectations of $2.25 to $2.75.Micky Arison, chief executive, said while several of the group’s cruise lines were receiving record booking numbers, these were being achieved at significantly lower prices.“As we had anticipated, people continue to book cruise vacations while seeking the best possible values,” he said. “Though pricing is down significantly we continue to fill our ships by reaching people who might not have otherwise considered a cruise vacation.”Carnival, which has 11 brands, including P&O Cruises and Cunard Line, also lowered its guidance on net revenue yield – an important industry metric that measures the amount cruise companies make from their passengers after subtracting expenses.The group, citing the deteriorating economic conditions in the US and UK, said it expected net revenue yield for the year to decrease 10-12 per cent on a constant dollar basis, compared to the 6-10 per cent decline it was expecting before.Wyn Ellis, an analyst at Numis Securities, said: “It is clear that while consumer demand is still there, it is only there at a price. Hence full-year yield guidance has been cut.”The reduced guidance came in spite of the 5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits reported by Carnival during the first quarter. Although revenue for the three months to end of February fell 9 per cent to $2.9bn, profits before tax rose from $226m to $238m (£162m) as a result of lower fuel costs and tighter cost control.In November, Carnival suspended its dividend to shore up its balance sheet ahead of $3.5bn in capital expenditure planned for the year. The shares, down 30 per cent over the past year, rose 46p to £16.56.
92;CCL;Carnival Corp;2009-03-24T19:13:32Z;Carnival;;"The cruising bug can be infectious. First timers who enjoy the experience tend to become advocates of shuffle board and dining at the captain’s table. And that enthusiasm among travellers of a certain age has some investors looking at demographic tables and concluding that the cruise line companies are a sure bet as baby boomers retire. The truth, however, is more complicated.As demonstrated by first-quarter results from Carnival on Tuesday, cruising is as susceptible to recession as any other consumer-orientated industry. Guidance for the expected decline in net revenues this year was cut from a range of 6 to 10 per cent to 10 to 12 per cent. Bookings were up but only thanks to heavy price cuts. Evidence so far from the second quarter is discouraging, and there is a risk that, even with 45 per cent of the total cruise ship market, Carnival will have to discount further as the year progresses.The problem is that cruising competes against all other holiday destinations available, and retirees living on interest income will feel the impact of the credit crunch. Cruising does not suffer the absence of corporate bookings affecting the hotel sector, but the downward pressure on prices drives down profits for the entire travel industry.Carnival intends to cut costs, and can run its ships less intensively to ease supply. But keeping one’s head above water is not enough for a capital-intensive business. Due to the three-year timeframe required to build a ship, Carnival is still committed to increase capacity – by 5 per cent this year and around 8 per cent in 2010. Such investment in the fleet while profits stagnate or erode means falling returns: to below the group’s cost of capital through 2011.

93;CCL;Carnival Corp;2008-09-18T21:57:11Z;Fuel costs prove a drag for Carnival;;Fuel costs have continued to overshadow Carnival’s performance, rising by 77 per cent and bearing down on the cruise operator’s profits.The global market leader, which has 11 brands, including P&O Cruises and Cunard Line, said advance bookings for the rest of the year and the first half of 2009 were “slightly behind” the previous year. Ticket prices for these bookings were at higher levels, Carnival said.Full-year fuel costs will rise by $678m, Carnival estimated, the upshot of which will be a drop of 83 cents in full-year earnings.Revenues of $4.8bn for the third quarter were 11.4 per cent up on the same period last year, on the back of an 8.8 per cent rise in capacity and increased revenue yields.But pre-tax profits fell from $1.42bn to $1.39bn and fourth-quarter earnings per share are expected to be down on the prior year. Fuel prices are forecast to be $60m lower than previously suggested for the fourth quarter, but the strengthening dollar will reduce expected earnings by $33m.Analysts gave the results a cautious welcome, pointing to controls on non-fuel cruise costs. But Citigroup said it could be harder for Carnival to maintain price levels if bookings continued to soften, and lower fuel prices could also be offset by a stronger dollar over the next 12 months.The market knocked 80p off Carnival’s share price, which closed at £18.90, a fall of 3.8 per cent.Micky Arison, Carnival’s chairman and chief executive, said all its leading brands were performing “quite well” in the face of economic uncertainty, with North American brands increasing yields and new capacity in European brands being well received.“While occupancy levels at this time are slightly behind the historically high levels of last year, they remain well ahead of 2006,” Mr Arison said.In an analysts’ conference call, Howard Frank, chief operating officer, said Carnival intended to stick to high prices even if demand continued to soften. The hurricane season had led to some softening in demand in the short-cruise market.Mr Frank refuted the idea that it was taking a risk by adding 8.8 per cent capacity into the European market next year.“Yield management is based on bookings,” Mr Frank said. “We are very confident in the capacity levels we have in Europe. We don’t have them in Spain, but we do have them in Italy and Germany.”
94;CCL;Carnival Corp;2008-09-02T20:51:52Z;Energy stocks drag Wall Street down;;"Energy stocks dragged Wall Street into the red on Tuesday as tumbling oil prices greeted investors returning from their Labor Day holiday. Crude oil fell as much as $8 a barrel before paring early losses.ExxonMobil dropped 3.4 per cent to $77.32 while ConocoPhillips dipped 4.3 per cent to $79. and refiner Tesoro slid 6.9 per cent to $17.28. Coal companies were particularly hard hit. Massey Energy dropped 10 per cent to $59.35, Arch Coal slid 14.8 per cent to $46.19 and Consol Energy lost 8.55 per cent to $61.92. So far this quarter, energy has been the worst performing sector, down 18.7 per cent. The materials sector, down 9.2 per cent over the period, shed another 2.5 per cent on Tuesday.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dipped 7 per cent to $83.05, Monsanto fell 4.3 per cent to $109.34 and US Steel lost 10.3 per cent to $119.39.Airline, automaker and consumer discretionary stocks helped the S&P 500 briefly break through the psychologically important 1,300 mark.However, the broader market gave up early gains. By the close however, the broader index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,277.55.Richard Parker, managing director of institutional equity trading at Stanford Financial said the morning rally “didn’t have an a awful lot of legs to it”.Analysts at JPMorgan’s Private Bank said: “Investors return from their summer holidays facing the same uncertainties as when they left . . . [Still] the current investor caution makes us think that equity prices may already be discounting many of the risks we’ve been concerned about.”Financials lost steam as the day progressed, although most banks held on to some modest gains. Bank of America climbed 3.4 per cent to $32.20 after Goldman Sachs recommended buying the shares on the basis of “long-term earnings power” and near-term capital options which could help it avoid issuing common equity.Lehman Brothers, the embattled investment bank, briefly advanced after reports that Korea Development Bank was in talks to buy a stake in the securities firm. At the close, Lehman shares were up 0.3 per cent to $16.13.Citigroup added 0.6 per cent to $19.11 while JPMorgan rose 1.3 per cent to $38.99 and the S&P 500 financials sector rose 1.8 per cent.Regions Financial also made progress, jumping 19.2 per cent to $11.05. The Alabama-based bank said it had assumed about $900m in total deposits from Integrity Bank, a failed bank.Meanwhile, the weaker-than-expected impact of Hurricane Gustav gave other energy-sensitive stocks a boost. Airline companies UAL, Delta and AMR soared 11.7 per cent to $12.41, 12.8 per cent to $9.17 and 11.3 per cent to $11.50.Automakers General Motors and Ford added 6.5 per cent to $10.65 and 1.12 per cent to $4.51.The broader consumer discretionary sector also made strong gains, led by consumer services and retail stocks as investors bet that falling oil prices would boost spending power.Carnival, the cruise operator, rose 5.6 per cent to $39.13, while Lowe’s added 6.9 per cent to $26.33. The sector as a whole rose 1.8 per cent.That, early positive momentum helped markets to glide past some weak macroeconomic data released in the mid-morning, showing a stagnant manufacturing sector and a further decline in construction spending.Since its low point on July 15, the benchmark S&P 500 index has bounced about
5.2 per cent, partly because of a 24.3 per cent drop in the price of oil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 2.1 per cent in early trading before giving up those gains to close at 11,516.92, down 0.2 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,349.24.In technology, Xerox climbed 3.1 per cent to $14.36 after Citi initiated coverage with a “buy” recommendation and a $20 price target.The office equipment maker had “perhaps the most compelling enterprise services portfolio of any company in the market”, Citi said.News that Google released its own internet browser initially helped the stock advance. But the moves were not enough to keep the sector in the black and it swung to losses of 1.4 per cent. Google shares slipped 0.4 per cent to $465.25."
95;CCL;Carnival Corp;2008-08-15T18:54:19Z;Dollar earners dominate London leaders;;Dollar earners dominated London’s leaderboard yesterday, with Carnival among the top performers.The cruise ship operator rose 3.6 per cent to £19.85 as oil prices retreated and sterling slid against the dollar for an 11th successive session. While greenback strength appeared to be a net negative to Carnival – it reports its earnings in dollars, but about a third of sales come from Europe – it allowed traders to take advantage of an arbitrage opportunity.Currency moves have pulled Carnival’s Wall Street-quoted stock to a 10 per cent premium against its London listing, according to analysis from Dresdner Kleinwort. That compares with an average historic premium of 3 per cent.“This is unlikely to be maintained and we expect the UK quote to play catch up,” the broker told clients.Transatlantic arbitrage also helped Shire, up 2.3 per cent to 961½p, and Experian, 2.2 per cent ahead at 414¾p. Meanwhile, companies with dollar exposure that benefited from the US currency’s strength included Rolls-Royce, up 2.8 per cent to 398¼p, and FirstGroup, 4.2 per cent higher at 581½p.A short squeeze pushed Wolseley to the top of the blue-chip risers, up 6.8 per cent to 438¾p. About half the plumber merchant’s revenue comes from the US.According to Data Explorers, nearly 18 per cent of Wolseley shares are out on loan. That is up from about 14 per cent in the past month, in spite of speculation about a possible US disposal.Falling metals prices meant miners dragged on the broader market, which lost all momentum after a mid-morning options expiry.Commodity stocks cost the FTSE 100 index 52 points in total. The benchmark finished down 42.6. or 0.8 per cent, at 5,454.8, as blue-chip trading volumes failed to breach 1bn for only the eighth session this year.The wooden spoon went to Kazakhmys, off 7.1 per cent to £11.73. Its Kazakh compatriot ENRC lost 6.5 per cent to 969p. But Ferrexpo outperformed, up 4.3 per cent to 245p. Russian brokerage Troika added the iron ore producer to its “buy” list on valuation grounds.InterContinental Hotels missed out on the day’s US-centric trend, falling 2.6 per cent to 725p after a downgrade from Morgan Stanley.The broker said average revenue per room was unlikely to improve before next summer, while cost inflation continues to run at a high rate and the US mid market, to which InterContinental is heavily exposed, has been lagging the sector.“If these concerns persist, InterContinental could end up being just as cyclical as other hoteliers, and the stock could also lose its premium multiple,” said analyst Jamie Rollo. Moving to an “underweight” rating, he recommended a switch into sector peer Whitbread, up 3 per cent at £11.83.Retailers were underpinned by data from John Lewis, which said weekly sales were up 9.3 per cent on strong trading in electricals and fashion.Marks and Spencer firmed 3.9 per cent to 276p. Deputy chairman Sir David Michels bought 37,734 shares at just under 265p each, his second purchase in weeks.Next rose 2.8 per cent to £10.37, Carphone Warehouse was at 201½p, up 2 per cent, and Kingfisher added 3.2 per cent to 130.1p. The gains came in spite of Exane BNP Paribas warning clients to be wary of the retail sector’s current rebound, given the potential for profit warnings after Christmas.“This is a sentiment-driven rally that will not last,” analyst Phil Rudman said. “In the UK, sales volumes are yet to capitulate, unemployment levels have only just begun to climb, and the housing market correction is still in its early days …overall, the highly probable stream of poor news that lies ahead of us, including the potential for the macroenvironment to deteriorate further than the market currently expects, represents far too much uncertainty to sustain any rally in retail shares prices.”Recruitment group Michael Page fell 5.2 per cent to 317½p after pulling out of bid talks with Adecco, its Swiss rival.
96;CCL;Carnival Corp;2008-07-17T20:35:53Z;Wall Street rallies on banks’ earnings;;The S&P 500 rallied for a second session on Thursday and edged back out of bear market territory as better-than-expected results from JPMorgan and another sharp drop in oil prices cheered investors.The day began in ebullient mood with stocks rising sharply after a number of leading banks and fund managers reported results.JPMorgan said profit fell 52 per cent to $2bn due to costs from the takeover of Bear Stearns in March and mortgage-related writedowns. But that was a smaller fall than expected.Shares in JPMorgan rose 13.5 per cent to $40.80, adding to the biggest one-day gain in almost six years that they made on Wednesday.PNC Financial Services Group, the Pittsburgh-based bank, and BlackRock, the asset manager, also posted better-than-expected earnings, while Merrill Lynch soothed investors by selling its stake in Bloomberg back to the data and services company for $4.5bn.PNC rose 13.5 per cent to $65.75, BlackRock added 16.2 per cent to $207.98 and Merrill advanced 9.8 per cent to $30.73.An exception to the positive news was the Bank of New York Mellon, which said second-quarter profits slumped 31 per cent to $309m on costs related to certain tax issues. Its shares fell 7.3 per cent to $35.42.The financial sector as a whole jumped 6.1 per cent in early trading while an index of investment banking shares rose 7.3 per cent.Analysts warned that any relief rally was likely to be short-lived. A number of them downgraded or cut their earnings forecasts for Wells Fargo, whose estimate-beating results on Wednesday spurred the biggest ever gain in financial shares and the biggest one-day rally on the S&P 500 since April.Keith Horowitz, a Citigroup analyst, said: “We expect to see a pick up in dilutive capital raises in the third quarter and increased concerns about spillover into commercial credit quality, which should continue to pressure [banking] stocks.”The benchmark S&P 500 pared gains late in the day but still closed 1.2 per cent higher at 1,259.97 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.8 per cent to 11,438.92 points, while the Nasdaq Composite finished 1.2 per cent higher at 2,312.30 points.In the past few weeks, earnings reports have been one of the only bright spots in an avalanche of bad news centring on the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.With 11 per cent of S&P 500 companies having reported second-quarter earnings so far, 72 per cent have beat expectations, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The number is even more surprising given that 34 per cent of the companies that have reported were financials.Outside of the financial sector, earnings reports were mixed on Thursday however. Danaher and United Technologies both beat analysts’ quarterly earnings expectations thanks in part to solid overseas sales and a weaker dollar. Danaher rose 6.2 per cent to $80.90, while United climbed 5.9 per cent to $64.70.Textron, however, held the sector to a 1.5 per cent gain after it noted rising energy costs and the weaker economy and forecast third-quarter profits that fell short of expectations. Textron slid 5.9 per cent to $43.25.Coca-Cola also disappointed investors. The world’s largest soft-drink maker said second-quarter profit fell after writedowns at its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises. Coca-Cola holds a 35 per cent stake in Coca-Cola Enterprises.Coca-Cola fell 3.8 per cent to $50.34 while Coca-Cola Enterprises, which posted a $3.17bn second-quarter loss, fell 0.1 per cent to $16.83.Those results, and poor same-store sales forecasts from Safeway, knocked the consumer staples sector into the red. Safeway fell 10.8 per cent to $26.78, while the sector lost 0.5 per cent.Market gains were also limited by some poor macro-economic data showing moderately higher rates of unemployment and further weakness in the housing sector.In the background, oil prices fell for a third day, helping consumer-facing and energy-dependent stocks.Carnival rose 9.7 per cent to $36.42, while General Motors climbed 11.9 per cent to $12.85. Sherwin-Williams also rose 12.3 per cent to $53.86 after the paint retailer said second-quarter profit fell less than analysts estimated.
97;CCL;Carnival Corp;2008-06-19T20:47:02Z;Wall St rebounds after drop in oil prices;;Wall Street stock markets rebounded on Thursday after a drop in oil prices buoyed consumer discretionary and transport stocks, taking the sting out of data showing continued weakness in the US economy and a warning from Citigroup about further writedowns.The day began in a downbeat fashion with new data that showed initial jobless claims dropped by less than expected last week, while manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region contracted more than expected in June.Still, it was the travails of the banking sector that weighed heaviest on equity markets in early trading. Comments from the chief financial officer of Citigroup accelerated losses.Gary Crittenden told investors that the largest US bank would have substantial writedowns on its holdings of subprime mortgage-related debt. Citigroup shares slid as much as 4.9 per cent before recovering to $20.17, down 1.3 per cent.As oil prices fell back however, a rally in the consumer discretionary and industrial sectors picked up steam, and they advanced 1.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively erasing early losses.Amid the broad market rally, even financials ended the day in positive territory, adding 0.9 per cent alongside a 1.2 per cent gain for technology.By the close S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent at 1,342.83 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly dipped below 12,000 points for the second successive day, before reviving. The index ended the day 0.3 per cent higher at 12,063.09 points. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.3 per cent to 2,446.99 points.On Wednesday, equity markets sold off sharply, and the Dow hit a three-month low, after declines in the banking sector and a downbeat outlook on the economy from FedEx weighed on sentiment.The pattern initially repeated on Thursday after analysts cut their earnings estimates for Morgan Stanley, triggering a sell-off. Morgan Stanley shares, which struggled to a small gain on Wednesday, fell 1.2 per cent to $40.19.Regional banks have come under particular selling pressure in the past few days as a number of analysts have questioned the ability of smaller, less capitalised banks to stand up to the strains of the credit crisis and mounting losses on mortgage assets.But they also found some positive momentum on Thursday, adding to their gains after BB&T said that it would increase its dividend, dismissing an analyst’s prediction that the North Carolina bank would do just the opposite. BB&T overturned early losses to climb 0.1 per cent to $24.35, while Fifth Third recovered 5.3 per cent to $9.75.Industrials proved robust, as transport stocks helped them shake off the poor macroeconomic data.A number of rail companies have given warnings that flooding in the Midwest of the US will dent earnings, most recently Burlington Northern Santa Fe, but analysts and investors remain positive over the long-term outlook for the sector.Burlington shares added 2.3 per cent to $105.55 while peers Union Pacific and CSX climbed 2.6 per cent to $77.80 and 3.3 per cent to $66.34 respectively.In earnings news, Circuit City Stores, the electronics retailer that put itself up for sale last month, disappointed investors by reporting a loss of $164.8m and revenue down 7.4 per cent to $2.3bn. Circuit shares fell 1.7 per cent to $3.98.Better than expected second-quarter results from Carnival, the cruise line company, a rally in oversold stocks in the staples sector and a $5 drop in oil prices helped keep consumer-facing stocks well above water.Carnival rose 5.4 per cent to $36.84 and Tyson Foods added 5.8 per cent to $14.47.Technology stocks were among the biggest gainers, benefiting from tumbling oil prices, which may ease strains on global economic growth. Microsoft rose 1.7 per cent to $28.93, Intel 2.6 per cent $22.85 and IBM 0.7 per cent to $125.02.Broadcom, the maker of chips for Nintendo’s Wii video-game console, rose 7.6 per cent to $27.22 after analysts at Lehman Brothers said second-quarter earnings will get a boost off higher demand.Energy was the only sector to close in the red.ExxonMobil dropped 2.3 per cent to $85.79 while ConocoPhillips fell 1.6 per cent to $93.66.
98;CCL;Carnival Corp;2008-06-19T19:01:41Z;Carnival downgrades earnings guidance;;Carnival, the world’s biggest cruise operator, has become the latest company to issue a profits warning as a result of the surging oil price.The Miami-based company, which operates the Cunard and Princess cruise lines, said full-year earnings were expected to be between $2.70 and $2.80 a share, compared with its previous guidance of $3.00 to $3.20 a share.The warning came in spite of efforts by the group to counter higher fuel costs by increasing ticket prices.Micky Arison, chief executive, said: “The impact of skyrocketing fuel prices on our operating results has overshadowed the revenue yield improvement we have experienced.”Oil prices have roughly doubled over the past year.A number of airlines, including EasyJet and Ryanair, have warned in recent months that the run-up in fuel prices could lead to a sharp decline in their profits this year.Mr Arison said second-quarter results were better than forecast due to solid cost controls.“Our North American and European brands continue to perform well in the current difficult economic environment and we were pleased with our second-quarter results.“Despite the current difficult economic environment, our booking trends continue to be solid,” he said.However, higher fuel prices cost the company $158m (£80m), or 19 cents a share, during the quarter. The company said it was expecting this year’s fuel cost to be $752m higher compared with 2007.Net profit for the second quarter was $390m, or 49 cents a share, compared with $390m, or 48 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.Analysts had on average expected quarterly earnings of about 42 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.Quarterly revenue was $3.4bn compared with $2.9bn in the same period a year ago.The stock has fallen by more than 30 per cent over the past year.
99;CCL;Carnival Corp;2008-03-12T17:04:59Z;Carnival’s US-style approach to governance;;The objections raised to Marks and Spencer’s surprise decision to appoint Sir Stuart Rose, chief executive, as the British retailer’s executive chairman must look strange seen from the US, where it is the norm for a company’s top executive to hold the roles of chairman and chief executive. As noted here last year, no less an authority than Alan Greenspan has concluded that “CEO control and the authoritarianism it breeds are probably the only way to run an enterprise successfully”.But since 2003, when Britain introduced its combined code on corporate governance, the number of large listed groups that give their chief executive the title of chairman has dwindled. One exception in the FTSE 100 blue-chip index is Carnival, the cruise line, whose long-standing chairman and chief executive is Micky Arison. He railed against the UK code’s strong recommendation to split the roles when Carnival took over P&O Princess Cruises in 2003. Carnival is an exception in other ways: a dual-listed company, run out of Miami, it boasts that it is the only group with a place in the FTSE 100 and the S&P 500.In fact, it is hard to see Carnival as anything other than an American company. The group seeks to comply with British best practice when US and UK governance customs clash. But on the chairmanship, it makes little excuse for deviating from the UK code. Most S&P 500 companies combine the roles of chairman and chief executive, Carnival points out, and the question of whether to change tack is best addressed as part of succession planning, following consultation with shareholders. Mr Arison is 58, shows no signs of stepping down and, directly or indirectly, owns 29 per cent of the votes in the company, so that stance seems unlikely to alter soon.Since 2003, British governance gurus have generally left Carnival alone, taking comfort in the presence of stalwart UK non-executives Baroness Hogg and Sir John Parker on the board. But Baroness Hogg, recently appointed deputy chairman of the UK’s Financial Reporting Council (overseer of the governance code), is stepping down. Persuading Mr Arison to give up one of his titles looks a lost cause, but if UK investors want to hold Carnival to its commitment to British governance principles, this is the moment to make themselves heard.andrew.hill@ft.com
100;CCL;Carnival Corp;2008-02-11T18:54:25Z;Europe’s saplings need financial fertiliser;;"After recent financial turmoil, it would be tempting for European policymakers to rein in the scope of financial innovation – tempting, but misguided. On the contrary, the current focus on financial stability must go hand in hand with a renewed policy impetus to improve the European financial system’s ability to foster enterprise growth.A look at the world’s largest companies offers both comfort and concern. On the face of it, Europe holds its ground well. Its share of the FT Global 500’s market value has increased over the past five years and now reaches 32 per cent, while the US share has plummeted from 57 per cent to 38 per cent. But, in contrast with the US and most other economies, Europe’s champions are ageing giants. Only 12 out of the 154 European companies in the ranking were created after 1950. Among US companies, those born after 1950 number 51 out of 174. Europe has a prosperous stock of established large companies, but does a dismal job of grooming new ones.One reason is that Europe lacks the high-powered innovation ecosystems that generate the Microsofts, Genentechs and Googles of this world. But among US companies now worth more than $20bn and born in the past half-century, high-technology companies remain a minority. Apart from a few energy companies, most of the rest are service innovators: the likes of FedEx, Carnival Cruises, Las Vegas Sands, retailers such as Wal-Mart or Home Depot, media outfits and financial services companies. Technological innovation, while crucial, is not the only factor driving the continuous emergence of new giants in the US. Others are the size of its domestic market, especially for services, where Europe remains fragmented; the flexibility of its labour market; and the higher cultural and social status of entrepreneurs.But an additional factor is often overlooked: the American finance industry offers more support for the growth of emerging companies than its European counterpart. Economic research in the past 20 years has firmly established that financial development is not only a consequence, but also a cause, of economic growth. Efficient financial systems enable the allocation of capital to businesses and entrepreneurs with the highest growth potential.Europe’s recent financial development has been impressive but remains unbalanced. The continent’s large companies can now rely on deep, liquid and efficient capital markets. But every available indicator suggests that emerging enterprises benefit from a wider range of appropriate financing solutions in the US than in Europe.Private equity comes first to mind. Beyond it, many credit offerings, such as high-yield bonds, mezzanine loans and other subordinated debt instruments are well suited to high-growth service businesses that can pledge no tangible assets as collateral. The markets for these financial products remain comparatively underdeveloped in Europe, especially outside the UK and Nordic countries.Moreover, corporate finance for mid-sized businesses is a proximity business: it must reach the companies where they are and it requires the intensive use of local information. The concentration of a very efficient finance industry in a few places cannot be a substitute for widespread financial development.This important factor in economic growth remains a blind spot of policy. The European Union’s much-heralded Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs has 24 “integrated guidelines”, but none specifically touches the financial system. The reasons may be found in the political economy of Europe’s post-war economies, when capital scarcity was the norm and the financial sector was managed under tight state control.A new impetus is needed to make Europe’s financial system more supportive of emerging enterprises. The times for direct provision of financing by governments, through co-investment or public guarantees, are largely gone. Instead, policy initiatives should focus on creating a level playing field with the right incentives for market players. Much could be achieved with a mix of assertive competition policy, less prescriptive securities regulation in markets reserved for professional investors, a Europe-wide effort to simplify and harmonise insolvency procedures, the elimination of tax distortions between financial instruments and an evolution of prudential rules to encourage investment in emerging companies. Many levers are at national level, but a concerted effort by the EU’s member states would maximise the chances of success.In the current turmoil, policymakers must keep their eye on the ball. Europe’s priority remains higher long-term growth and that means entrepreneurial new companies. The financial crisis will inevitably result in a rash of initiatives and regulations: in their discussion, all should remember that what Europe needs is more private equity for growth and expansion, more venture capital, a liquid market for high-yield bonds and more sophisticated and competitive corporate finance offerings.Policy responses to the perils of instability should not put a heavy lid on those financial innovations that are necessary to improve Europe’s growth potential. From an economic and political point of view, Europe’s financial system must be improved so that more young sprouts can grow and challenge Europe’s tall old corporate trees.The writers, respectively assistant professor of finance at NYU Stern School of Business and research fellow at Bruegel, are the authors of Financing Europe’s Fast Movers (www.bruegel.org)"
101;CCL;Carnival Corp;2007-10-11T18:53:34Z;Will Queen Elizabeth launch Fincantieri’s flotation?;;Italy’s state-owned shipbuilding group Fincantieri has just landed one of the most prestigious orders in the world of luxury cruising. This week, it was chosen by Cunard, now controlled by Carnival of the US, to build the new Queen Elizabeth liner.The €500m, 92,000 tonne ship will be the third majestic liner named Queen Elizabeth. The first was built in 1938 and destroyed by fire in 1972 in Hong Kong. The second was sold this year to the Dubai government, which plans to convert it to a hotel and museum. So the latest ship will revive the Cunard tradition of Queen Elizabeth liners and should give the Italian yard a boost for its long-delayed partial privatisation plans.The company was already in fine shape before winning this glamorous order. In the past few years it has been transformed under the direction of Giuseppe Bono, its chief executive, to one of the jewels of the Italian government’s industrial portfolio. It commands about 40 per cent of the world cruise ship market and is a respected supplier of military vessels. It is profitable and has no debt – no small achievements, especially for a state-owned company.It was ready to be floated on the stock market in 2006. Today, it is in even fitter condition to attract investors, given that the global shipbuilding industry is enjoying a boom driven by strong Asian demand and continuing expansion in the cruise industry.This has not escaped the government, which has already given the nod to the sale of 49 per cent of the group. Well aware that economic conditions in the shipping sector are favourable to secure a good price, the plan now is to float Fincantieri next April. The flotation is all the more important because the estimated €400m-€600m ($569m-$854m) proceeds will not be used to replenish state coffers but will be reinvested to support growth and expansion.So far, so good. Sadly though, what should be a smooth sell-off has turned into another classic Italian political mess. The government has continued to delay its formal announcement of the flotation because of fears that the process could further unsettle its wobbly coalition.In this case, only one small union representing about 500 of the group’s 10,000 workers is kicking up a fuss and opposing the state sell-off. Normally, such obstacles would fall in the face of the approval from the company’s other unions.However, the union in question represents the most radical wing of the big CGIL confederation and has become a convenient weapon for the more radical former Communist members of the Italian governing coalition. The coalition of Romano Prodi, the prime minister, is more vulnerable because it does not have a majority in the Senate. So opponents, even if they are members of the coalition and holding government office, feel little compulsion to toe the line when an opportunity to make trouble emerges.The government is well aware of its weakness and while it may be willing to take some risks, such as this week’s workers referendum on reforming the welfare system, the partial sale of a shipbuilding company that is doing fine may not be worth the gamble. For the company and the vast majority of its employees this would be an awful shame.Lisbon in limboWith the Lisbon agenda, European governments set themselves the ambitious challenge seven years ago to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. Seven years later, notes Henri de Castries, Axa’s chief executive, the Lisbon agenda is still in the “deep freeze”.In the meantime, other regions of the world have been developing their academic and research capabilities. In India, for example, 500,000 engineers graduate each year. Only about 80,000 graduate each year in both France and Germany. As for Shanghai, Mr de Castries says the Chinese university produces 10 times more graduates each year than France’s top polytechnique engineering school.But if European governments have been painfully slow to implement the Lisbon agenda, more and more European companies are tackling the issue by setting up funds or foundations to support academic and scientific research. This week, two French multinationals unveiled new schemes. L’Oreal announced a €40m foundation to finance educational projects and scientific research and Axa launched a €100m fund to support academic institutions and individuals in post-doctorate work.Mr de Castries admits that some of the French insurer’s shareholders would have preferred the funds to have been used to increase the dividend or buy back stock. But he says you cannot take a short-term view on this issue. “Europe needs a competitive education system. Otherwise we risk losing our European roots, as the economic battle today is being waged over brains and knowledge.”european.view@ft.com

CVS sank 8.4 per cent to $32.47 and Walgreen slid 7.4 per cent to $46.28.Pharmacy benefit managers, who administer prescription drug plans for companies and insurance groups, also fell on the news.Medco Health Solutions slid 3.8 per cent to $60.48, and Caremark Rx sank

Barrick Gold rose 2.5 per cent to $29.06 and Phelps Dodge added 2.9 per cent to $83.79.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent, or 7.15 points, at 1,318.03, well down from a 5½-year high recorded on Wednesday.The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.7 per cent, or 15.14 points, at 2,237.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also down 0.7 per cent, or 79.96 points, at 11,538.23.The main indices had edged higher at the start of trade after the Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday to leave interest rates unchanged.But news that the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s business activity index for August had fallen to its lowest level for more than three years heightened concerns about a broad US economic slowdown.“This breaks a string of 14 straight positive readings, and is much weaker than expected,” said analysts at ActionEconomics.Breakfast cereal maker General Mills climbed 3.3 per cent to $54.75 after it reported a better-than-expected 6 per cent rise in first quarter earnings.Consumer stocks were among the main losers from the Philadelphia Fed data. Amazon tumbled 5.9 per cent to $30.22, and Federated Department Stores dropped 4.1 per cent to $40.95.Tribune, owner of the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Cubs baseball team, rose 4.4 per cent to $32.05 on speculation that it would announce a restructuring.Media group CBS sank 1.1 per cent to $28.25.Hospira, a maker of drug delivery systems, rose 4.4 per cent to $39.20 on news that it would buy Australia’s Mayne Pharmaceuticals for $2bn.

104;CCL;Carnival Corp;2006-09-12T17:06:30Z;London cruises higher on Carnival hopes;;Carnival closed at its highest level since May as investors revisited the stock ahead of next week’s results.Shares in the world’s biggest cruise operator have been the worst performer in the FTSE 100 this year. They have fallen 26 per cent, with most of the damage done in May when the company was forced to cut its 2006 profit forecast.But Carnival rose 3.6 per cent to £24.33 yesterday amid talk that the results for the key summer months of June, July and August will meet expectations.Traders noted rival Royal Caribbean recently raised its earnings forecast for the three months to September, citing stronger than expected bookings for cruises in Europe and the Caribbean.Moreover, they reckon bookings will have benefited from a particularly quiet start to the US hurricane season.In the wider market, leading shares traded in a narrow range until Wall Street opened higher in the wake of strong results from Goldman Sachs. With investors eager to put cash into the market, the FTSE 100 finished 44.7 points, or 0.7 per cent, higher at 5,895.5.Lower down the market, the FTSE 250 rose 82.4 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 9,605.5, lifted by engineering group Charter, which put on 8.4 per cent to close at 781½p on news that full-year results will exceed expectations.However, broadcaster ITV missed out on yesterday’s gains. Its shares fell 2.2 per cent to 98¾p as the City reflected on Monday’s comments from UTV, which owns the ITV franchise in Northern Ireland.Alongside half-year results, UTV, up 1.1 per cent to 370¾p, suggested advertising revenues at ITV1 looked as if they would be down as much as 20 per cent in October.Also weighing on ITV yesterday was news that Cazenove had reiterated its “underperform” rating after meeting with the company on Monday night.The broker said advertisers were still holding back on spending and that there was unlikely to be any change to the contract rights renewal system - which allows advertisers to claim money back if ITV fails to hit certain audience targets - until 2008 at the earliest.Mining stocks remained under pressure as investors continued to switch into telecom and technology stocks. One beneficiary of that move was Sage, the accountancy software group, which rose 2.2 per cent to 247 ¼p. Another was Vodafone, up 2.4 per cent to 117½p.Vodafone also drew strength from Telecom Italia’s decision to spin off its network and mobile phone arm TIM.“Telecom Italia will not be able to cross-sell mobile services to existing fixed line corporate customers - this is a major relief for Vodafone,” John Karadis at Man Securities said.On a more speculative tack, Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steel group, improved 2.2 per cent to 375¾p after UBS highlighted the benefits of a deal to source low cost slab for overseas producers.Andrew Snowdowne estimates a deal with a Russian producer could generate additional annual operating profits of £92m and a tie-up with a Brazilian manufacturer £82m.At last month’s interim results presentation, Corus directors hinted that they were talking to other producers with a view to sourcing slab.Centrica gained 2.8 per cent to 319¾p and for once it had little to do with takeover rumours. Traders reckon the owner of British Gas is a major beneficiary of the 25 per cent fall in winter wholesale gas prices over the past four months. This is because Centrica does not produce enough gas to supply its 12m customers and is therefore forced to buy in the market.Elsewhere, BAE Systems added 3.3 per cent to 385 ½p as traders squared positions ahead of results on Wednesday.Rumours of predatory interest from Spain - BBVA was the name in the frame - saw Lloyds TSB rise 1.1 per cent to 528p.Away from the blue chips, housebuilder Redrow added 7.5 per cent to 570p after full-year figures impressed and takeover rumours continued to swirl.Morgan Crucible, the industrial ceramics and carbon specialist, was marked 6.8 per cent higher at 297p amid rumours of an update on the takeover approach revealed a month ago. However, sources familiar with the situation said no statement was imminent.However, Misys did provide an update on bid talks yesterday and its shares promptly fell 7.8 per cent to 231¼p. The softwware company said it had yet to receive an approach it could recommend to shareholders.
105;CCL;Carnival Corp;2006-09-01T17:51:56Z;Hello? Oh hi darling, I’m on the ship;;Taking a cruise used to be one of the few ways for travellers to “get away from it all”, blissfully out of telephonic reach – except in an emergency - until the ship docked in port. Not so today.Cingular Wireless, the biggest US mobile carrier, is busy wiring many of the world’s biggest cruise ships with the equipment needed to make and receive mobile phone calls, send text messages or check e-mail using passengers’ own handsets.The news comes only days after Ryanair, the cut-price airline, said it would equip its fleet of aircraft with an onboard mobile service by next year.Cingular, through its Wireless Maritime Services joint venture with Maritime Telecommunications Network, is rapidly cornering the expanding cruise ship mobile telephony market signing up many of the biggest cruise ship lines including Carnival Cruise Lines, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean.WMS already provides cellular service for eight cruise lines and has roaming agreements in place with over 300 carriers, both GSM and rival CDMA carriers, in over 180 countries.That means in most cases passengers who bring their own mobile phones – or BlackBerrys – can use them on board paying the same sort of roaming fees that they would if they were visiting a foreign country.“A year ago we had seven ships and now we have 31 ships fitted out,” said Leighton Carroll, chief executive of the WMS joint venture. “By the end of this year it will be 50 plus.” And usage is also soaring – up 1,000 per cent over the past year, according to Mr Carroll.“Consumers view cell phones as a necessity in today’s world,” said Bob Dickenson, Carnival’s chief executive in June when the cruse ship line signed a deal with WMS covering Carnival’s fleet of 21 vessels.Carnival currently also has three new ships on order - including the 110,000-ton Carnival Freedom, due for delivery in February, which will also be fitted with the gear needed to send and receive wireless voice and data calls.New cruise ships like the Carnival Freedom are typically built with the sophisticated electronics needed to turn them into floating mobile phone cell sites already installed, but WMS also retrofits ships – usually when they are in port.Calls to and from ships are routed via Maritime Telecommunications Network’s satellites and through the WMS shore-based routers to the wireless networks.

They were dragged lower by a drop in commodities prices.Lower crude prices dragged down oil stocks. The Amex Oil Index had its worst day since February, shedding 3.2 per cent. BJ Services lost 5.2 per cent to $33.88, while ConocoPhillips slipped 3.2 per cent to $59.20. Helmerich & Payne, in Oklahoma, slid 4.7 per cent to $55.38.Falls in metal prices hit mining stocks. Alcoa shed 3.3 per cent to $29.10, and Phelps Dodge fell 3.8 per cent to $77.07.General Motors rose 2.9 per cent to $26.35 on news that its largest supplier Delphi had reached a deal with its second-largest trade union for employee buy-outs. At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.9 per cent or 11.40 points at 1,240.14, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.9 per cent or 19.53 points at 2,110.42. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent or 72.44 points at 10,942.11.Chris Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, believes investors are preferring to watch and wait. “A lot of investors, both retail and institutional, are waiting to see how things shape up over the next few days,” he said.“It’s one of those …markets where things are on sale, but cheap can always get cheaper.”Ashland, the chemicals and construction group, rose 4.7 per cent to $64.64 after the Irish construction company CRH said it was in talks to buy its asphalt and construction units.Consumer products group Alberto-Culver climbed 2 per cent to $47.61 after it announced it would spin off Sally Beauty Company, its supplies business.Carmax, the used-car retailer, jumped 7.6 per cent to $33.89 after it reported quarterly earnings ahead of analyst expectations.A brokerage upgrade sent Monster Worldwide 4.5 per cent higher to $43.02. Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the stock from “equal weight” to “overweight”, arguing that concerns about the company’s stock-options were already in the price.Starwood Hotels added 1.6 per cent to $57.46 on news the company would open a luxury hotel in Qatar at the end of next year.Technology stocks performed better, with Microsoft gaining 2 per cent to $22.55. Hewlett-Packard gained 1.6 per cent to $33.57. It has risen 13 per cent in the past week.Carnival Cruise Lines sailed higher after Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan both gave positive assessments of the company’s stock. Shares added 3.1 per cent to $41.45.Circuit City fell 2.9 to $28.63 despite reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit. The company said that higher interest rates narrowed margins.
107;CCL;Carnival Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
108;CCL;Carnival Corp;2006-06-16T13:30:18Z;Fuel costs hit Carnival earnings;;Carnival, the world’s largest cruise operator, reported a 2.1 per cent drop in second quarter profits on Friday because of rising fuel costs.Net income for Carnival dropped by $8m to $380m, or $0.46 per share, from $388m, or $0.47 a share, in the year ago quarter, but beat its forecasts of $0.43-$0.45 a share.The results also beat average analysts estimates, according to Thomson Financial, of 0.45 a share.Higher fuel prices reduced earnings by $74m, or 9 cents a share from 2005, contributing to a 4.6 per cent rise in net daily berth costs.The company has had a turbulent year, and said it had been hit by a drop off in bookings for Caribbean cruises after last year’s record hurricane season.Howard Frame chief operating officer, said “Before the year started we did not foresee the softness we are currently experiencing in the Caribbean market.”In March an onboard fire on one of its ships left one passenger dead and also led to cancellations in bookings.The operator of the the Princess, Holland America and Cunard cruise brands said its profit forecast remained at $2.65-$2.75 a share for the year, following earnings downgrades in March and May.Revenues grew by 5.8 per cent to $2.66bn, because of an increase in capacity and increased revenue yields, the company said.Micky Arison, chief executive, said “Our second quarter earnings were largely in line with expectations.”Its shares rose 35 cents to $38.52 on the New York Stock Exchange.In response to increasing global competition, Carnival is building 16 ships to add to its 80-strong fleet.In July, the cruise company will launch a five-day cruise aimed at the Chinese market, departing from Shanghai. Carnival is the first large cruise operator to be granted a license by the Chinese government, and said they had already sold out their first voyage on the ship.
109;CCL;Carnival Corp;2006-05-19T20:57:52Z;Wall Street lower amid mixed data;;"Wall Street finished the week lower as mixed economic data painted a confusing picture for investors worried about the possibility of interest rate rises.A commodities sell-off dented the materials and energy sectors, while retail stocks were also in the spotlight as a range of earnings reports mostly heartened investors.Economic data provided cause for cheer and worry in equal measure in a week that saw the release of key inflation numbers. Although producer price data were benign, they were followed by worryingly robust consumer price numbers, which fanned fears that the Federal Reserve would be forced to raise rates again in June.Analysts said weak commodity stocks and inflation concerns were the key drivers behind the week’s decline in equity prices.“I would give equal weight to [commodities prices and] continued concern that inflationary fears will keep the Fed on a tightening trend,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “The market didn’t think this was the case for the first four months of the year and it did some adjusting this week.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent, or 5.22 points, for the day at 1,267.03, down 1.9 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite picked up, gaining 0.6 per cent, or 13.56 points for the day at 2,193.88 – a loss of 2.2 per cent for the week. on Friday the index finally broke eight days of consecutive declines, its worse losing streak since September 1994.The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up on Friday, adding 0.1 per cent, or 15.77 points, to 11,144.06, a fall of 2.1 per cent since Monday.In a depressing week for the markets, retail offered some therapy. It was the only major sector to end higher, thanks to mostly strong earnings reports.Robust numbers lifted Sears Holdings after it surprised investors with a
19 per cent increase in quarterly profit. The company’s shares gained 16.1 per cent to $161.89 for the week, its highest level since July of last year. It was the best performer in the S&P 500.The markets also warmed to Wal-Mart. The world’s largest retailer nudged up
1.7 per cent to $47.32 after it announced a 6 per cent rise in quarterly profits. The results, ahead of forecasts, offset a warning that high energy prices could affect results for this quarter.Others were less fortunate. Wal-Mart’s rival Target fell 5.8 per cent to $49.16, in spite of news of a 12 per cent increase in quarterly earnings. The stock was undermined by concerns about the retailer’s shrinking margins.Staples slid 7.9 per cent to $24.52. Although profits rose strongly, investors took fright at sluggish same-store sales that rose just 1 per cent, the slowest rate in three years.The commodities bull run finally looked like it might be running out of steam after a broad-based sell-off on Monday dragged oil and metals lower. A brief rally on Tuesday failed to hold, and Nymex crude for June settled on Friday at $68.53, down 5 per cent for the week, while gold and copper also fell steeply. The S&P Metals and Mining Index was down 10.2 per cent for the week.“The good news is that this takes a bit of the inflationary fears away,” said Mr Hogan.Oil services company Noble shed 11.2 per cent to $68.98, its lowest level since November 2005. ConocoPhillips sank 3.8 per cent to $62.72.Mining and materials stocks also suffered. Barrick Gold shed 9 per cent to $30.56 and Phelps Dodge, the copper producer, lost 12.9 per cent to $83.06. Aluminium producer Alcoa fell 8 per cent to $31.98.One of biggest decliners over the week was Carnival Cruises which shed 12.8 per cent to $40.71 after it cut its outlook for 2006. Of the 10 worst performing stocks on the S&P 500, Carnival was the only stock not involved in energy or mining.Technology stocks were on the move as Advanced Micro Devices surged 10.4 per cent to $34.95 after Dell Computer announced it would no longer exclusively use Intel chips in its PCs. Intel was down 3.6 per cent to $18.36 on the news.But Apple continued to fall, losing 3.5 per cent to $64.51 as Singapore-based rival Creative Labs accused it of patent infringement, prompting a counter-suit from Apple."
110;CCL;Carnival Corp;2006-05-16T22:24:33Z;Ill winds buffet Carnival cruises;;"Carnival, the world’s largest cruise operator, on Tuesday cut its earnings outlook for the year on lower bookings for Caribbean voyages, soaring fuel costs and an accounting change.Lingering fears of hurricanes in the wake of Hurricane Katrina has deterred consumers from booking Caribbean cruises that depart from Florida and other ports vulnerable to storms.“We underestimated the psychological effect that hurricanes had on the mindsets …of people taking cruise vacations,” the company said.Shares in Carnival plunged 8.5 per cent to end Tuesday’s session at $42.60.The company, with brands that include Princess and Cunard of Queen Mary fame, on Tuesday forecast earnings for fiscal 2006 in the range of $2.65 to $2.75 per share, down from average analysts’ estimates of $2.93 per share.The company lowered its earnings forecasts in March after reporting a 19 per cent drop in first quarter profit.Advance bookings from North America, the cruise industry’s core market, have slowed for this year's third and fourth quarters. Third-quarter occupancy is down 6.2 percentage points for Caribbean cruises compared with last year, but up 3.6 points for European cruises.Although the cruise industry is stringently conserving fuel, soaring energy costs continue to hurt profits. The cumulative impact of higher fuel prices for 2006 is expected to be $265m.Carnival was also hit by an accounting change related to ship building and renovation costs, reducing full-year earnings per share by about 8 cents.However, Micky Arison, chief executive, said that industry fundamentals “remain sound”.On Royal Caribbean’s new ship, Freedom of the Seas, which made its debut last week as the world’s largest cruise liner, he said: “If Freedom gets half the PR that Queen Mary got, it will be positive for the industry.”Carnival’s guidance revision marks the latest headwind for the cruise industry, marring unexpected buoyancy after 9/11.But the industry has recently been at the centre of negative publicity following a fire aboard a Princess ship; a car crash during a celebrity cruise day trip; a pirate attack on luxury liner Seabourn near Somalia; and a probe into a honeymooner’s disappearance from a Royal Caribbean ship.A US Congressional panel heard testimony about shipboard security and safety in December and demanded statistics for crimes on cruises."
111;CCL;Carnival Corp;2006-05-16T20:46:33Z;Wall Street down as data vies with earnings;;Wall Street closed down on Tuesday paring advances made earlier in the day as disappointing results from retailers combined with anxiety about inflation, despite the release of relatively benign economic data.Stocks in focus included Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Staples.The US producer price index rose 0.9 per cent in April, fuelled by higher energy and commodity prices. However, the core PPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.1 per cent, less than had been forecast, giving some comfort to investors who had feared the data could add pressure on the Federal Reserve to ratchet up interest rates.“The market was up on the fact that the core rate of inflation was lower than expected, but the higher number was still a scary number,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach.Separately, data on new housing starts showed the pace of new home building dropped to its slowest since November 2004, adding to the gloom from a report on Monday showing declining confidence among homebuilders.“The housing market was one of the strong performers of the economy. We are now seeing it weaken and that’s one of the reasons why the market is softer,” said Mr Cardillo.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent or 2.42 points, at 1,292.08, while the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.4 per cent, or 9.39 points, to 2,229.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent, or 8.88 points, at 11,419.89.Wal-Mart nudged up 1.4 per cent to $48.07 after it announced a 6 per cent rise in quarterly profit. The results, above Wall Street forecasts, offset a warning from the world’s largest retailer that high energy prices could affect results for this quarter.In spite of Wal-Mart’s advances, retail was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500. Home Depot reported a 19 per cent increase in first-quarter profit, but shares fell 5.1 per cent to $38.45, after the home-improvement retailer said it was “disappointed” with its core retail sales.Staples slid 6.1 per cent to $24.82. Although quarterly profits rose strongly, investors took fright at sluggish same-store sales that rose 1 per cent, the slowest rate in three years.The company’s stock has lagged rivals Office Max and Office Depot, which have added 69 per cent and 38 per cent respectively this year. Prior to Tuesday’s fall, Staples had gained 16 per cent for the year and is now up only 9 per cent.Litigation threats rattled Apple Computer. Singapore-based Creative Labs filed a suit against Apple for infringing the patent on its Zen brand of digital music player. Apple fell 4.2 per cent to $64.98.Carnival sank 8.5 per cent to $42.60 in heavy trading after it cut its earnings per share estimates for 2006.
112;CCL;Carnival Corp;2006-03-23T22:18:25Z;Fuel costs sink into profits at Carnival;;Carnival, the world’s largest cruise operator, on Thursday cut its annual earnings forecast as it reported a 19 per cent drop in first quarter profit because of higher fuel costs.Carnival, whose shares fell 4.9 per cent to $47.58 in early afternoon trading, lowered its 2006 guidance to $2.90-$3 a share from its December forecast of $3-$3.10. The operator of the Princess, Holland America and Cunard cruise brands said fuel prices rose 63 per cent, leading to an $82m increase in fuel costs.Micky Arison, chief executive, said excluding the higher fuel costs, the company “performed well” during the quarter. Net income fell to $280m, or 34 cents a share, from $345m, or 42 cents, a year ago. Excluding 2 cents of charges because of an investment write-down and a litigation reserve, Carnival would have earned 36 cents a share, in line with estimates.Revenue rose 2.7 per cent to $2.46bn while net revenue yields, a key industry indicator, increased 1.2 per cent from a year ago.The earnings results came on the same day that Princess Cruises, owned by Carnival, said one passenger died and 11 were hurt when a fire broke out on the passenger decks of a ship sailing from the Cayman Islands to Jamaica.Separately, 12 tourists, passengers from a Celebrity Cruises ship, died in northern Chile on Wednesday when their private tour bus swerved to avoid an oncoming truck and plunged 300 ft down a mountainside.Shares of Royal Caribbean, which owns Celebrity, fell 4 per cent to $40 by early afternoon.
113;CCL;Carnival Corp;2005-09-19T14:59:15Z;Strong demand for cruises buoys Carnival;;Consumers’ appetite for cruises fuelled a 12 per cent rise in third-quarter net income at Carnival, the world’s largest cruise operator.The group, which brands including Princess Cruises and P&O, said on Monday that good demand had pushed up ticket prices and onboard revenue.Third-quarter sales increased 11 per cent to $3.61bn.“Significant improvements in pricing, particularly for our North American brands, more than compensated for increases in fuel costs,” said Micky Arison, chairman and chief executive.Carnival cautioned, however, that Hurricane Katrina would have some impact on fourth-quarter profits.The group said one cruise and been cancelled and two shortened by the hurricane. Carnival has docked two of its ships in New Orleans to provide housing for relief workers, police officers and fire fighters, and a third ship in Alabama, which is providing housing for evacuees.It also warned that riding fuel costs would continue to weigh on profits. Mr Arison said fuel costs could be up to $200m more in 2006 than 2005.The group nevertheless gave a positive outlook, expecting a 20 per cent rise in earnings per share for the full year.Carnival forecast a 4.5-5.5 per cent rise in net revenue yields in the fourth quarter and said early 2006 bookings and prices were ahead of this year.Earnings per share rose to $1.43 from $1.28 in the three months to August 31. Net income was $1.15bn.The news helped push the group’s shares up 3.6 per cent to $50.80.
114;CCL;Carnival Corp;2005-06-17T12:17:25Z;Lex: Cruise operators;;Cruises have long been derided as galas for grannies. But prospects for the big two cruise operators, Carnival and Royal Caribbean Cruises, look anything but geriatric. Carnival's acquisition of rival P&O Princess Cruises in 2003 created the industry's current duopoly. That, together with a strong euro inflating costs at European shipyards, ended the industry's naval race, stabilising capacity and thereby yields. Carnival's second quarter results beat expectations on profits, with net yields up by 8.7 per cent.Catering to pensioners is a growth industry: the US's 82m baby boomers spend more on leisure than any other age group. But despite its grey tinge, the cruise business is still relatively immature. Fewer than 3 per cent of US holidays are on cruise ships. And with travel agents still taking 85 per cent of bookings, there are costs to be cut. It is not all plain sailing. Rising fuel costs have weighed on the sector this year, and the threat of consumer weakness clouds the horizon. But as a recent survey from UK tour operator First Choice showed, holidays are way down the hit-list when it comes to belt-tightening.Despite their run-up since April, shares in Carnival and Royal Caribbean trade on 2006 price/earnings multiples of 17 and 15 times, respectively. That is cheap compared with US hotel stocks. And Carnival alone will generate $2.7bn of free cash flow over the next three years, after $5bn of investment in new ships. Investors of all ages should get on board.
115;CCL;Carnival Corp;2004-09-17T17:12:35Z;FTSE rises out of its trading range;;London's leading shares closed at their highest level for more than two years on Friday as the FTSE 100 index finally appeared to break out of the trading range that has constrained it all year.Dealers attributed Friday's surge to triple witching the expiry of three different futures and options contracts in mid-morning. “All those who had been selling the FTSE short in June and July were simply squeezed out of the market today,” said one trader.The FTSE100 closed at 4,591.0, up 0.8 per cent on the day and 1 per cent on the week, and its highest level since July 2002. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index also got in on the act, rising 0.6 per cent to 6,296.1, a gain of 0.8 per cent over the week.Volume totalled 3bn shares on Friday, but traders reported that dealing throughout the rest of the week was relatively quiet. One noted that one of the trends of the week was the decoupling of stocks that tended to track the benchmark index. Companies such as SABMiller and Cadbury Schweppes were becoming far more volatile than in the past, he noted. “It's been a quiet week for index trading but there's increasing intra-stock volatility,” he said.Few expected the relatively calm conditions to last. “Funds will have to get back into the market as they need to chase the returns,” said the head of one sales desk.The takeover of Abbey National, which was threatening to become a drawn-out saga, appeared to be over on Wednesday after rival mortgage bank HBOS decided against launching a counterbid. The news cleared Abbey's principal suitor, the Spanish bank Santander Central Hispano, to proceed with its agreed £8.5bn bid. Abbey National finished down 7.8 per cent at 571p but HBOS rose 7.4 per cent at 766p.Attention immediately turned to other potential targets in the banking sector. Of the most prominent three, Lloyds TSB gained 0.6 per cent to 432p, Alliance and Leicester was 1.4 per cent stronger at 902p but Bradford & Bingley fell 2 per cent to 288½p.Amvescap, the Anglo-American fund manager, climbed 8.6 per cent to 322p despite cutting its dividend by 50 per cent to 2½p in response to its $450m settlement with US regulators over mis-selling of mutual funds. Investors were more relieved that the payout had not been scrapped entirely. With the issue resolved, traders also speculated it could now become a takeover target for a US company.Next, the designer clothing chain, surprised and delighted the market with yet another set of bumper earnings results. Some felt the stock was becoming something of a haven and the company's figures were in sharp contrast with results from French Connection, published on the same day. The latter flagged up ‘unusually poor' trading conditions for August in the UK, and while many felt the company's heavy fall on Wednesday was overdone, it also reinforced in many investors' minds the strength of Next's figures. Next closed the week up 6.8 per cent at £16.04 while French Connection lost 11.2 per cent to 335p.House of Fraser, the upmarket department store chain, was down 9.5 per cent at 115p after retail entrepreneur Tom Hunter and Icelandic investment group Baugur sold their combined stakes, amounting to 49m shares or 21 per cent of the company.Mid-cap retailer Big Food Group came under the spotlight with a rise of 11.4 per cent to 102¾p after it confirmed it had held preliminary discussions with a potential bidder about an offer at 110p per share. Late in the day the bidder was confirmed to be Baugur, and there were rumours it had joined forces with a private equity group to prepare an offer.Richard Ratner of Seymour Pierce said: “This would value the equity at around £380m, but we must also point out that there is over £250m of debt, giving an enterprise value of £630m, which, in our view, is quite high enough.”Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus was 9.3 per cent stronger at 53p, touching its highest level in two years as the market applauded the company's first profit in five years.Mining stocks, as well as Corus, gained as hopes that the sector would continue to benefit from China's demand for steel, and by extension, iron ore. Goldman Sachs estimated that steel prices were likely to rise around 20 per cent over the next two years owing to Chinese demand. Rio Tinto rose 7.4 per cent to £14.48, BHP Billiton added 7 per cent to 556½p, and Xstrata was 4.8 per cent higher at 875p. Chilean copper miner Antofagasta lagged the sector, rising only 1.9 per cent to £10.72, as Morgan Stanley cut its rating to ‘underweight', seeing better prospects for bulk commodities. For that reason, the broker preferred Billiton and Rio to Antofagasta.Intercontinental, the hotels group, added 6.9 per cent to 646p as investors applauded interim results.
