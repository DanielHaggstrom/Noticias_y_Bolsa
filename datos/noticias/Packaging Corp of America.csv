0;PKG;Packaging Corp of America;2016-10-19T22:22:30Z;Packaging Corp of America profits slip 7%;;Shares of Packaging Corp. of America eased in extended trading on Wednesday after the group reported a 7 per cent decline in third quarter net income from a year earlier, despite efforts to grow by snapping up smaller rivals.Shares rose 2 per cent to a fresh record high of $85.54 on Wednesday ahead of the announcement, but erased that gain on the news. Shares had gained more than 30 per cent since last December.The containerboard and corrugated packaging maker reported net income of $119.3m from $127.8m in the same period in 2015. On an adjusted basis, which excludes certain items, profits of $1.30 a shares missed Wall Street expectations by one cent.Net sales edged up slightly to $1.5bn.PCA said corrugated product shipments hit an all-time record in the third quarter but overall profit was eroded by lower prices.The company said it expects fourth quarter earnings to rise to $1.15 per share from $1.07 last year, partly due to price increases and the additional contribution of TimBar, a corrugated paper maker, that it acquired in August. The figure came in shy of Wall Street estimates of $1.18.
1;PKG;Packaging Corp of America;2013-09-16T22:17:44Z;Boxes: a bet on growth;PCA to buy rival Boise for just under $2bn, including debt;The internet may have sent white paper and (sigh) newsprint into decline, but it has, if anything, done the opposite for the humble cardboard box. Corrugated paper is a bright spot in the pulp and paper industry. When economies are expanding, plenty of stuff still gets stuck in cartons and shipped around.Packaging Corporation of America is betting on such expansion. On Monday it said it would buy rival Boise for $12.55 a share, or just under $2bn, including debt. The deal will increase PCA’s containerboard capacity by almost half.The purchase price equals a premium of 26 per cent to Boise’s share price on Friday, but the more interesting thing is that shareholders of the acquirer were pleased as well. PCA’s shares shot up more than 10 per cent. The company needed such a deal to boost growth and establish a presence in the Pacific Northwest. Meanwhile, PCA expects synergies to generate pre-tax savings of $105m annually after three years. If that’s right, the premium PCA paid will prove more than worth it and the share jump makes sense.Adding to the benefits for PCA, the deal is the latest in a series, and consolidation is always a help in a commodity industry. In 2011, RockTenn agreed to buy Smurfit-Stone for $3.5bn and International Paper bought Temple-Inland for $3.7bn. If the PCA deal proceeds, the top four players will control more than three-fourths of the industry, compared with 65 per cent in 2010, according to Barclays. After languishing in the years following the financial crisis and recession, prices for containerboard have been climbing since the middle of last year, RISI data show. Some grades have seen increases of more than 20 per cent.So the paper industry is to be congratulated on becoming markedly more rational.

2;PKG;Packaging Corp of America;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
