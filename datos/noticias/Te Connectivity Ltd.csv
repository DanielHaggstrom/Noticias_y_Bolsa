The logic was that if every passenger took a comfort break in advance, the aircraft’s load would be lighter and the engines would burn less fuel.The trial only lasted a month, but it highlighted the aerospace industry’s weight obsession. Weight is one of the three most important factors, after aerodynamics and engine performance, affecting the efficiency of an aircraft. Less fuel means lower carbon dioxide emissions, as well as savings on a significant operating cost for airlines. Finding new ways to slim down the global fleet is preoccupying the aerospace industry as it prepares for the next generation of aircraft, expected to start flying before 2030. In October, governments agreed the world’s first global climate deal for the aviation industry, which accounts for 2 per cent of all CO2 emissions. With the number of air passengers set to jump from 3.6bn last year to 16bn by 2050, according to Iata, the trade body, every aspect of aviation is being scrutinised to cut growing emissions.“If you take 1,000lbs [454kg] out of the weight of an engine that is worth 1 per cent of fuel. It is a big financial saving but also good for the environment,” says Ric Parker, former director of research and technology at Rolls-Royce and now chairman of the EU’s Clean Sky initiative. “Anything you can do to reduce weight is a good thing.”The extensive use of new materials — including carbon fibre reinforced polymer — has led to huge weight savings. Composite materials were introduced in 1985 on the tail fin of aircraft such as the Airbus A310 wide-body. Today, Boeing and Airbus have broken new ground with their latest wide-body models, the 787 and A350. Roughly half of these aircraft is made of carbon fibre plastic and other composite materials. Boeing boasts that the 787 — whose smallest model weighs 161 tonnes — offers a 20 per cent weight saving compared with the equivalent aluminium aircraft. Scroll down for graphics looking at where the weight is being lost ——————————-Engine makers, too, are finding ways to lighten their turbines — on average weighing 6,350kg each for large jets. Roughly 340kg can be cut from a wide-body engine by using composite materials for fan blades and the fan case, according to Rolls-Royce. Titanium aluminide, an even newer material that replaces heavier nickel alloys, can make further reductions in the hottest parts of an engine. It is a virtuous circle, says Mr Parker. “If you put on a blade that is one-third the weight you can have a turbine disc that is lighter as well. And then the casing can be lighter and thinner. The positive benefit goes round and round.”Other advanced materials, such as lighter metal alloys and graphene, are also making a difference. Geoff Hunt, chief engineer at UTC Aerospace Systems, says titanium alloys have reduced the weight of landing gear by thousands of kilogrammes on the biggest jets. Hundreds more can also be saved with carbon technology, new painting techniques and changes to sealant, according to PPG, a coatings company. “If you can reduce the load you can reduce the reinforcement of the structure,” says Robert Lafontan, senior vice-president of engineering at Airbus.Today’s aircraft are not necessarily lighter, however. Many of the pounds shed in recent years have simply made room for new features or more passengers. Boeing introduced larger windows on its 787, which would have had a “prohibitive” impact on weight without savings elsewhere, says Larry Schneider, chief programme engineer for the 777. Regulators are also raising safety standards. The requirement for safer seats a decade ago added some 5 tonnes (5,000kg) to the average weight of an aircraft, for example. Recaro, the German-based seat supplier, says it has shed all of that weight and more with slimline composite frames. Pre-reclined seats have done away with the need for heavy mechanical components that allow movement. Power consumption is also rising, creating a need for heavier wiring and more heat management. The average large commercial passenger jet has about 40 per cent more electronics than a few years ago, according to TE Connectivity. Up to 60 per cent of the weight of wiring — which could amount to 5,700kg on a superjumbo — could be cut by switching from copper to aluminium. New manufacturing methods such as 3D printing offer radical ways to design aircraft and components. “Through 3D printing you can actually make the strength where you need it . . . and take out all the other weight,” says Bob Smith, chief technology officer at Honeywell Aerospace.Electrically powered aircraft, where much development funding is being focused, also have the potential to be lighter and more fuel efficient. Russ Dunn, a senior vice-president of GKN, the UK aerospace supplier, says the combination of new technology and materials will revolutionise aircraft design and the way passengers travel. By 2050 those 16bn air passengers may be enjoying a radically different experience — with one exception: the toilets may be made of lighter materials, but it would be a brave airline that decides to do away with them altogether.Graphics by Ian BottCockpit Airlines have replaced the pilot’s 18kg (40lb) flight bag, holding manual and maps, with lighter electronic tablets. LED displays also require thinner, lighter screens.Fuselage Boeing’s 787 broke new ground with a lighter composite fuselage made all in one piece. This did away with the need for thousands of fasteners to hold it together, helping to cut the weight of the aircraft by 20 per cent.Engines Engine manufacturers are investing heavily in weight saving technology to offset ever larger engines. Making fan blades and the fan case from carbon fibre composite materials can cut 340kg out of an engine, says Rolls-Royce. Using ceramic matrix composites in the hottest parts of the engine can eliminate even more. General Electric is making further gains through 3D technology. It recently printed a third of a turboprop engine, which weighs 5 per cent less than the traditional propeller system and reduces fuel burn by 1 per cent. The potential is clear for jet engines.Tail skid Replacing the alloy tail skid that protects the back of the fuselage on take-off with an electronic warning system has cut 147kg from the 777-300ER.Electrification Electrical systems have been used on the 787 to replace some heavy, mechanically controlled systems. Research is now focused on the potential for electric propulsion, which one day might result in fewer gas turbines powering an aircraft. Given the state and weight of batteries, however, this is still a long way in the future.Galleys Eliminating hot meals on selected flights has allowed some airlines to remove ovens, waste compactors and entire galleys.Wings Composite materials are reducing the weight of wings but a lightning strike would punch straight through without the inclusion of metallic elements. To avoid adding that extra weight, European researchers are working on using the conductivity of carbon nanotube materials in wings to protect against lightning strikes.Seat The requirement for added safety features increased the weight of the average economy seat by 50 per cent to 15kg. Replacing aluminium alloys with composite materials and a slimmer design have brought the average weight back to 10kg, and allowed airlines to squeeze in more passengers.Windows Pressurised cabins put huge strain on windows, which require big load-bearing frames for protection. But advances in transparency technology mean the windows can now take the structural load, eliminating the need for the frames and some 250kg-300kg, according to PPG. Eventually there may be no need for windows at all beyond the cockpit, if aircraft are lined with flexible displays depicting a variety of soothing scenes.Wheels New rubber technology has shed 50kg from the 12 tyres on a Boeing 777-300ER wide-body jet.Brakes The shift from conventional to carbon brakes cut 907kg from the weight of the 747’s 16 braking systems, according to UTC Aerospace Systems.Sealant Chemical advances have led to meaningful reductions in the weight of sealant used across the airframe. Today’s sealant is 30 per cent lighter than the formulas used 20 years ago, saving as much as 544kg on a widebody aircraft.Cabling and wiring Replacing copper with aluminium wires could save up to 60 per cent of the 1,200kg of cabling on the typical single-aisle jet. But if carbon nanotubes are proven to be reliable conductors, weight reduction could reach as much as 70 per cent. Managing heat dissipation allows engineers to reduce the conductor diameter, saving up to 20 per cent of the weight.Washers Boeing has saved 53kg by eliminating the need for 20,000 washers on the 777-300ER.Paint Painting and coating the outside of a superjumbo like the A380 adds between 650kg and 1,000kg, and significantly more if the weight of coating all the components is included. New techniques such as electrically charging parts before dipping them in a paint bath could save 30-70 per cent of the weight on 3m-4m components.

Adjusting for certain pension change charges, Kroger said it earned $1.09 in the three months to May 24.On a call with analysts, chief executive Rodney McMullen said the company was seeing positive indicators as the economy continued to recover.“Our customers have exhibited less cautious spending behaviour,” Mr McMullen said. “Consistent with the rise in the consumer confidence index in May, our own customer research tells us that more customers perceive the economy to be in recovery.”Kroger now projects earnings for the year between $3.19 and $3.27 a share, with same-store sales expected to rise as much as 4 per cent from a year earlier. Analysts with Oppenheimer lifted their earnings forecasts as a result.“Sales trends are likely to remain strong over the next few quarters, in our view, as company investments take hold, inflation benefits accelerate, and the US jobs backdrop improves,” analyst Rupesh Parikh said.Kroger was the last company within the S&P 500 index to report first-quarter results. Earnings for the index rose 3.4 per cent from a year earlier, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.Those figures outpaced expectations earlier in the year, when severe winter weather crimped most forecasts.Kroger shares advanced just over 5 per cent to close at $49.66 while rival Supervalu rose 0.63 per cent to $7.95.Shares of Red Hat increased 3.79 per cent to $55.11 after the software company said sales rose 17 per cent to $424m.Analysts with Susquehanna maintained their neutral rating but increased the company’s target price from $54 to $57 a share, citing Red Hat’s recently announced acquisition of eNovance as well as its product pipeline.Shares in Measurement Specialties, a maker of sensors and sensor-based systems, jumped almost 11 per cent to close at $86.38 after TE Connectivity announced plans to acquire the company for $1.7bn including debt.The $86-a-share deal represents a 10 per cent premium on Wednesday’s closing price and gives TE access to Measurement Specialties’ range of pressure, vibration, force, temperature, humidity, position and fluid sensors.Measurement Specialties is expected to generate $540m in sales during the current fiscal year.Industries from energy to manufacturing are increasingly connected via the “internet of things”, as oil rigs, manufacturing equipment and ships, to name a few, “talk” to their administrators, increasing efficiency and enabling real-time monitoring.Shares in TE increased 0.29 per cent to $62.23.As Markit makes its US debut, shares in the financial data provider climbed almost 10 per cent as they began trading in New York. The stock closed at $26.70 after selling for $24 on Wednesday night.The offering raised $1.28bn, which will primarily go to selling stockholders. However, analysts say Markit is now in a better position to compete with rivals including Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg.Coach shares led the declines on the S&P 500, touching the lowest level since 2010, after executives said comparable sales would continue to decline in its 2015 fiscal year.Shares in the handbag retailer tumbled almost 9 per cent to close at $35.69.Overall, US equities ended mixed following the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting.The S&P 500 rose 0.13 per cent to close at 1,959.48 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.09 per cent to 16,921.46. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.08 per cent to end the day at 4,359.33.
2;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2012-01-05T20:05:47Z;Tyco extends Eversheds legal contract;;Eversheds, the London-headquartered law firm, has won a contract to deliver all legal work for Tyco International, the manufacturing group, for a fixed fee in more than 70 countries, in a renewal of an innovative agreement first forged over five years ago.The contract is reportedly worth £16m ($25m) over two years for Eversheds, which had revenues of £354.5m in the last fiscal year, making it the UK’s 10th-biggest law firm by revenues. The deal gives Eversheds guaranteed income at a time when a drop in the amount of mergers and acquisitions-related work has increased competition among law firms.Benefits for Tyco, beyond savings of millions of dollars, include “consistency in service across a great number of countries, improved risk and compliance, and – probably the most impressive feature – a change in mindset towards cost management and the delivery of legal services across the Tyco business and every Eversheds office,” said Dave Symonds, Tyco’s senior corporate counsel for Europe.Eversheds maintains that more sophisticated advice – on M&A, compliance and intellectual property – represents the majority of work for Tyco, rather than more commonplace services such as advice on property or employment law. The firm is paid more for sophisticated work, said Stephen Hopkins, the partner at Eversheds who manages the relationship with Tyco.The 2007 arrangement was a landmark for the legal industry, with Tyco culling its roster of 250 law firms to just Eversheds in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in return for a flat fee. But today the contract underscores a post-recession legal market where groups must look for ways to cut their legal costs and where all law firms must be receptive to fee arrangements beyond the traditional billable hour.“Confounding the sceptics, our relationship with Tyco has continued to flourish and evolve,” said Bryan Hughes, Eversheds’ chief executive. “We now utilise many of the disciplines derived from the Tyco partnership with other clients, including Brady, Rolls-Royce and Orange.”In 2007 Tyco also attempted to shake off a crippling scandal, which saw its one-time chief executive Dennis Kozlowski sent to jail for securities fraud, by splitting itself into three units: Tyco Healthcare, now known as Covidien, Tyco Electronics, now TE Connectivity, and Tyco International, the industrial portion of the business that is Eversheds’ client.In September, Tyco International said it would reshuffle again, splitting further into three: a US-based residential security company centred on its ADT brand, a non-US-based flow control products and services group, and a Switzerland-based commercial fire and security business. Eversheds will work for the latter two businesses, Mr Hopkins said.
3;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2011-11-30T18:40:34Z;Wendel in $2.1bn deal to sell off Deutsch;;Wendel, France’s largest publicly listed investment company, has agreed the $2.1bn (€1.6bn) sale of its Deutsch electrical connections business, in a deal that will allow it to reduce its €5bn net debt faster.Frédéric Lemoine, Wendel’s chief executive, has been cutting debt and selling assets to boost cash since his appointment in 2009. However, shares in the largely family-owned firm – which has a 300-year history and helped create the French steel industry – have fallen about 40 per cent in the past six months because of fears about Europe’s rapidly deteriorating economy.The company is an investor in several leading manufacturers, including Legrand and Saint-Gobain in France. On Wednesday, the shares rose 16 per cent, or €7.39, to €53.33 as investors welcomed the agreed sale of Deutsch to Swiss-based TE Connectivity, the world’s largest electrical and data connections-maker – formerly known as Tyco Electronics.Mr Lemoine indicated that the sale would give Wendel cash to seek opportunities at a time when the weak economy could throw up some bargains, while also addressing concerns about debt. “These are two key success factors in the current economic environment,” he said.Wendel said the net proceeds from the deal would amount to €954m, representing a capital gain of €575m, equivalent to 2.4 times its total investment. Mr Lemoine had already cut net debt from €8.5bn when he took over to €5bn at the end of August. He also sold a 4.9 per cent stake in Legrand this month, making a €191m capital gain.The French investment firm bought US-based Deutsch in 2006. Deutsch has 3,600 employees in more than 25 countries and expects sales of approximately $670m for 2011. It makes electrical connectors for harsh environments in aerospace, defence and offshore oil and gas sectors, where TE is looking to expand.TE, which has a $12bn market value and employs 95,000 people, intends to finance the deal with cash and debt.Wendel is being advised by financial advisory firm Ondra Partners and law firm Linklaters.

Just three years ago Mike McTighe, Volex’s chairman, said the company was in “corporate triage”, but since then it has undergone a restructuring.Ray Walsh, chief executive, said management was closely watching developments in Europe and hoped to see sustained improvement in the US. “That being said, we don’t have any indication of clients pushing orders down,” he said.The UK-based company, which has consumer, telecoms, healthcare and industrial divisions, said group revenues increased by 14 per cent to $270.6m.Revenues in the company’s healthcare business jumped 30 per cent, driven by the launch of a digital broadband MRI scanner with Philips earlier this year.Its consumer division, accounting for around 60 per cent of revenues, also recorded double-digit revenue growth, due largely to the company’s development of next-generation connectors using halogen-free material.The company uses a share-based payment scheme to incentivise managers. After this charge, the company’s pre-tax profits dipped 3 per cent to $10.3m while diluted earnings a share rose 4 per cent to 14.4c. The company declared an interim dividend of 1.5c a share.Mr McTighe implemented a turnround plan in 2008, which involved replacing the senior management team and investing in manufacturing, adding to capacity for high-speed copper processes and IT infrastructure.Capital expenditure grew by 92 per cent to $4.8m in the first half, which the company said matched its strategy.Thomas Rands, analyst at Peel Hunt, said he was not worried about the company’s high spending.“The balancing act now is to increase revenues while increasing margins,” he said.Volex’s gross margins were down 0.5 per cent from last year to 19.2 per cent. This compares with industry peers such as Amphenol, which had a gross margin of 32.6 per cent, Molex’s 30.3 per cent, and Tyco’s 37.7 per cent.Volex said its peers had greater scale and a stronger product mix.The company’s shares, trading at 30.5p three years ago, fell 1.6 per cent to 283.5p on Wednesday.
5;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2011-09-19T13:50:14Z;Tyco set to split three ways to lure suitors;;Tyco International, the US industrial conglomerate, said on Monday that it planned to split itself into three publicly listed parts, a move that could make it easier for suitors to buy the standalone companies.The company is the latest conglomerate to break itself apart in an attempt to expose unrealised value. In the past year, ITT, Fortune Brands and Sara Lee have all adopted split-up strategies.Investors broadly welcomed the plans with Tyco shares rising 2.4 per cent to close at $44.75, giving the company a market capitalisation of about $21bn.However, credit rating agencies were cautious. Both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s placed the company under review for a possible downgrade, noting that the split-up could leave debt holders with claims on smaller companies with less diverse revenues than at present.Analysts said the break-up could make the component companies attractive takeover targets. In recent months Tyco has been linked to takeover attempts by a number of industrial groups, but the sheer size and complexity of the company has stumped suitors.Ed Breen, chief executive of Tyco, said the move was the “next logical step for Tyco”. Over the past five years or so, the company has slowly broken apart a conglomerate structure built since the 1960s.In 2007, after one-time chief executive Dennis Kozlowski went to jail for securities fraud, Tyco split itself into three units: Tyco Healthcare, which is now known as Covidien, Tyco Electronics, now called TE Connectivity, and Tyco International, the industrial portion of the business.In the latest reshuffle, Tyco International will become three separate and slightly lopsided businesses: a US-based residential security company centred around its ADT brand, a non-US-based flow control products and services group and a Switzerland-based commercial fire and security business.“In an environment desperate for growth, we see strategics [have] a bit more urgency [to do deals], and this puts Tyco now squarely in the middle of what should be a ramp in activity,” Stephen Tusa, with JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients.Jeff Sprague, with Vertical Research Partners, in a note to clients identified AT&T, Comcast and Verizon among the potential buyers of the ADT business. He added Schneider Electric, United Technologies and Siemens could be potential buyers for the fire and security business while General Electric or UTC might find its flow control business attractive.The ADT business will have revenues of about $3bn and about 16,000 workers. The flow control business will have about $4bn in revenues and about 15,000 employees. The commercial fire and security company will have $10bn of sales and 69,000 workers.On a conference call Mr Breen told investors that the businesses would be better placed to succeed on their own because they had very little overlap in customers or end markets and “operate with very distinct business models, each with different capital investment needs and growth profiles”.Tyco intends to facilitate the deal by issuing tax-free stock dividends to Tyco shareholders. The company expects the transactions to be completed in about a year, subject to shareholder approval and other conditions.Completing the deal, however, will be costly. Tyco expects one-time transaction costs to total $700m including debt refinancing and restructuring, although that will be partially offset by lower interest expenses and some operational advantages.Tyco was advised by Goldman Sachs and Lazard.
6;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2011-07-01T12:39:13Z;Kraft move may signal return of the corporate raider;Trian takes stake in one of Wall Street’s ‘untouchables’;To most people, “the untouchables” brings to mind the intrepid 1930s G-Men who hunted down Al Capone or perhaps the down-and-out in India’s caste system. To Nelson Peltz, chief of fund manager Trian, which this week announced a stake in Kraft Foods, it is the top tier of companies worth more than $50bn that activist investors such as himself have, until recently, had difficulty in pressuring.If his name rings a bell then it should. Mr Peltz was among Wall Street’s leading corporate raiders in the 1980s – an era memorialised on celluloid in Oliver Stone’s morality tale Wall Street but also in several non-fiction books as gripping as any novel. Even a quarter of a century later, some accounts of that swashbuckling period remain among the best-known business tomes. Today’s readers, de-sensitised by subsequent scandals such as Enron, Tyco and Madoff, are fascinated more by the tales of brash upstarts, often with immigrant or working class backgrounds, taking on establishment figures heading brand-name companies than the insider trading prosecutions of Ivan Boesky or Michael Milken.Mr Peltz, along with fellow parvenus Carl Icahn, Ronald Perelman and Meshulam Riklis, features prominently in Connie Bruck’s classic account of the 1980s takeover wave, The Predator’s Ball. In it, she describes the raiders’ chief enabler Drexel Burnham Lambert as “the brass knuckles, threatening, market-manipulating Cosa Nostra of the securities world”. Mr Milken, Drexel’s junk bond king, was shown an advance proof and offered to pay Ms Bruck prior to publication for all the copies she hoped to sell, presumably as kindling for a bonfire. Given the option, he might well have tossed her on top for good measure.These financial minnows with mere tens of millions of dollars of hard-earned cash at their disposal could target far larger prey backed by Drexel’s well-oiled junk bond machine. Perhaps Ms Bruck’s mafia comparison is excessive, but most corporate chieftains who tangled with Mr Milken’s acolytes wound up sleeping with the metaphorical fishes.That era’s signature deal, the leveraged buy-out of RJR Nabisco immortalised in Barbarians at the Gate, was so massive that it was then far out of Mr Peltz’s league and foreshadowed the fund-driven deals that would emerge in the next era of cheap money two decades later. Although the most recent buy-out boom has names attached to it – Stephen Schwarzman, David Rubenstein and the protagonist of the RJR drama, Henry Kravis – they are more closely associated with the pools of money they control (Blackstone, Carlyle and KKR, respectively). These private equity buyers also were more likely to be welcomed with open arms rather than rebuffed or bought off by their corporate targets as was so often the case in the 1980s.The end of the latest bubble era has brought raiders, now benignly dubbed “activist investors”, back into the limelight. Whatever the moniker, they still try to profit from amassing stakes in underachieving companies rather than relying on leverage alone. With more firepower than in the 1980s (Trian manages about $3bn) and more public sympathy, they can be fearsome.In recent years, Mr Peltz has agitated for value creation at Cadbury Schweppes, HJ Heinz, and Family Dollar. After gaining board seats and reducing his stake ahead of the Cadbury takeover, he is again stalking Kraft, a bona-fide untouchable with its $60bn market value. The story of his fiery first meeting with Heinz’s chief in 2006, when he announced rather than requested board seats, was pure Gordon Gekko.Of course there are activist fund managers out there with more funds and better name recognition thanks to the CNBC generation – Bill Ackman of Pershing Square for example, who was a schoolchild when Mr Peltz launched his first hostile takeover. But the mystique and street smarts of an investor who cut his teeth when activism elicited comparisons with organised crime are incomparable. Who better to make a chief executive an offer he can’t refuse?
7;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2011-02-22T20:27:21Z;Focus on support for SMEs;;When Honda shut car production at its Swindon plant for four months in early 2009, this Wiltshire town became one of the earliest symbols of the recession.By far the biggest private sector employer in the area, Honda’s silent production lines were a shock to a town that has long held an enviable employment rate of about 78 per cent, with the fifth highest job rate in the country, according to the Centre for Cities.Advantageously set in the M4 corridor, Swindon has attracted a host of large, international employers across manufacturing, technology and financial services, ranging from Honda and BMW’s Mini plant, to Motorola, Tyco Electronics, Nationwide and Zurich insurers.It is also ranked by the Centre for Cities as the least likely of 63 cities to suffer from public sector job losses.But even in the decade to 2008, Swindon lost more than 7 per cent of its private sector jobs as manufacturing declined. It was among the first towns to be hard hit in the recession, as well as the most severely affected sub-region in the south-west.Motorola has shrunk its workforce in the town and Tyco, the US electronics maker, switched a factory to the Czech Republic.The town was also home to Woolworth’s main distribution warehouse before the company collapsed. Honda, which in 2008 employed 4,600 people on double day shifts churning out a record 245,000 cars, now has 3,000 staff producing 139,000 vehicles a year on a single shift.Martin Watch, human resources and planning manager at Honda Swindon, says there is still hope for growth in manufacturing, particularly as the plant has recently won production of the new Civic, due to start late this year.“The good news is, if the market stays the same, we can maintain our headcount. But we hope there will be an incremental increase in volume, which might mean a partial second shift, so we would take on more people,” he says.Yet no one here really expects manufacturing to create the numbers of jobs it did in the past. Mark Beard, managing director of Beard Construction, a 120-year-old Swindon building company, says although such lower-skilled jobs are welcome for the local economy, they “do nothing to turn Swindon into a professional centre for high-paid jobs”.Beard, now in its fourth generation of family leadership, employs 167 people and turns over about £50m a year. Though it shed 19 people a year and a half ago, it has since taken on about half that number.What the town needs for a more resilient economy, he says, are more “sticky” midsize companies that are rooted in Swindon and will grow over time.Heydar Faramarzi, managing director of Emnico Technologies, says: “What we need are people like me.” He formed his IT company in 2007 after being made redundant from Alcatel-Lucent, and it has grown to 20 employees and £1.5m turnover. He predicts the company will double in size within five years.“Big companies based here have reduced in size and people who worked for them have started small businesses. I can name at least 10 people who have come out of large businesses in Swindon and set up their own companies.”Swindon has a growing entrepreneurial culture, according to Bill Cotton at the economic development company Forward Swindon, but that will take time to deliver significant jobs growth.The focus, he says, should be: “Where can we find the companies employing 50 people now that will be the ones that will go on to employ 200, and how can we support them?”
8;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2010-10-07T16:04:28Z;Tax migration;It is easier than ever to shift corporate headquarters overseas;Companies prioritise employee lifestyle over profit more than many investors realise. Just observe the host of Europe’s private equity and hedge funds which base themselves in Mayfair, one of London’s priciest pin-striped haunts, when their business could be theoretically run from a caravan with Wifi. But already personal taxes have prompted some big hedge fund managers to leave for Switzerland. Now a rethink has started at the corporate level as well.Tax, as ever, is the most common motivation for changing bases. Switzerland will be the new legal home of Wolseley, the UK building supplies group. There it will join the Americans Tyco Electronics (formerly a tax exile in Bermuda) and Transocean, which owned the ill-fated Deepwater Horizon oil rig. British WPP and Shire are now technically Irish, while Diageo and Inneos are thinking of moving out of Britain.For the losing jurisdiction, the initial cost of a corporate departure is small. Almost all corporate taxes are still paid in the countries where the profits are earned, while few jobs are actually moved out of the operating headquarters. But greater shifts can follow, as advisory and support work migrates to the new head office’s location, taking hotel and restaurant trade from the old to the new headquarters.The UK is in a weak position to keep multinationals, as it can effectively tax profits at UK companies’ “controlled foreign companies” after they have already paid tax abroad. Despite widespread baying for corporate blood and the pressures on governments to raise revenues, countries on the losing end of the battle for headquarters, including France and the UK, are reviewing corporate taxes to create incentives for businesses to stay. With cheap travel and communications making corporate moves easier, jurisdictions which offer bad deals can expect to suffer.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

10;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2010-07-13T22:33:52Z;Tyco Electronics in $1.25bn deal for ADC;;Tyco Electronics, the maker of electronics components, has agreed to buy ADC Telecommunications for about $1.25bn, including debt, as it seeks to strengthen its position in the broadband connectivity market.Tyco will pay $12.75 a share in cash for the equipment maker, in a deal that gives the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company an equity value of about $1.24bn. ADC has net debt of about $100m.The price represents a 44 per cent premium to where ADC shares closed on Monday. Tyco Electronics shares rose 4.75 per cent on Tuesday to $26.48, while ADC shares jumped almost 42 per cent to $12.52 in morning trading in New York.For Tyco, the deal is a bet on growing demand for broadband capacity as consumers buy and use data hungry devices such as smartphones and high definition televisions, and businesses turn to video conferencing to reduce costs.“The combination of ADC and Tyco Electronics creates an industry leader, with the scope and geographic scale to help customers deliver needed capacity, from the core of the network all the way to the end user,” Tom Lynch, chief executive of Tyco, said.Tyco’s existing business is stronger outside the US, particularly in Europe, while ADC has a substantial presence in the US and China.Still, in a recent interview Robert E. Switz, chairman and chief executive of ADC, noted that the competitive environment for ADC was “very challenging” because its customer base has been consolidating and shrinking.During the recession, ADC struggled as its large clients, which include AT&T and Verizon, cut their capital expenditures. ADC last year slashed costs and laid off part of its workforce in response to the downturn.At the same time, Mr Switz noted that demand has shifted so that it is now “primarily coming out of emerging markets. This globalisation has also made the industry much more competitive than it was several years ago.”In 2009 ADC had sales of about $1.2bn of which about 35 per cent came from outside the US. Tyco is paying close to 10 times forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the fiscal year to September 2010.Barclays Capital advised Tyco Electronics while Morgan Stanley advised ADC.Tyco Electronics was formed when Tyco International, a company that became infamous after being looted by former chief executive Dennis Kozlowski, split itself into three parts in June 2007.The Schaffhausen, Switzerland-based company, had sales of $10.3bn in 2009 mainly to the automotive, data communication systems and broadband infrastructure industries.On Tuesday it reported preliminary results for its fiscal third quarter. The company made $0.72 earnings per share, compared with a loss of $0.16 in 2009, on sales of $3.1bn, up 23 per cent on the prior year.Tyco expects the acquisition will generate cost savings of $100m, will add to earnings in year one and plans to raise ADC’s operating margins from 5 per cent to 15 per cent over three years. Cash acquisition costs will be $110m to $130m.The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2010 and requires shareholder and regulatory approval.
11;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2010-07-13T20:57:14Z;Alcoa and CSX earnings lead Wall St higher;;US stocks rallied on Wall Street on Tuesday for the sixth consecutive session as the earnings season got off to a better start than many had feared.Alcoa and CSX, the first two S&P 500 components to report, both posted slightly better-than-expected earnings on Monday after the market close.Myles Zyblock, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, expects the earnings quarter to most likely be solid again. However, he added: “Nevertheless, we believe the potential for somewhat waffling guidance has the equity community worried at present.”Investors remain fearful. Mr Zyblock said: “The budding note of caution seems most closely linked to the idea that we had all turned too optimistic about growth rates on earnings.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 1.5 per cent at 1,095.34, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4 per cent to 10,363.02 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2 per cent to 2,242.03.Alcoa advanced 1.2 per cent to $11 a day after the largest US aluminium producer reported second-quarter profit that modestly beat analysts’ expectations, as higher metal prices boosted revenues.CSX, a freight transportation company, fell 1.4 per cent to $51.72 after rallying at the start of the session. It had reported second-quarter earnings of $1.07 per share, also topping analysts’ average estimates.Tyco Electronics, a leading maker of electronic connectors, rallied 2.5 per cent to $25.92 as it agreed to buy ADC Telecommunications for about $1.25bn to bolster its broadband connectivity products offering.Shares in ADC surged 41.5 per cent to $12.52. Trading in the stock was halted for part of the session.AIG gained 6.8 per cent to $37.99 as the bailed-out insurer’s board was reported to be close to agreeing to sell its AIA Asian unit in an initial public offering. An announced sale of the unit to London-listed Prudential collapsed last month after the latter’s shareholders failed to support the deal.Intel, a leading semiconductor maker, was up 2.1 per cent to $21 ahead of its second-quarter earnings announcement, due after the close of trading.US-listed shares in BP were up 0.3 per cent to $36.88, as tests continued on its new sealing cap for the leaking oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The company is forecast to pay about $10bn less tax over the next four years as it meets the costs of its huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, hitting the revenues that Britain and the US receive from the oil group each year.Apple was among the worst performers in the S&P 500 as the stock dropped 2.1 per cent to $251.80. Its latest iPhone model was not recommended by Consumer Reports, an influential publication which carries out consumer products comparisons, in its latest review of smartphones. JPMorgan said that Apple was set for “prolonged negative” public relations after failing to win the’commendation.“The problem seems to be a design flaw, and it is significant,” said Mike Gikas, senior electronics editor at Consumer Reports. The publication has recommended the three previous iPhone models.Financial stocks were higher across the board as a landmark financial reform bill neared final approval in Congress. Three Republicans said late on Monday they would support the bill, boosting the 54 Democrats and two independents who are also expected to vote for it. The bill needs 60 votes be approved.Goldman Sachs was up 2.2 per cent to $140.25, Citigroup added 4.6 per cent to $4.30, Morgan Stanley gained 4.5 per cent to $25.66 and JPMorganclimbed 3.3 per cent to $40.48.Invesco, the manager of the Aim and PowerShares funds, was one of the day’s best performers as it rallied 6.5 per cent to $19.43. The company reported assets under management of $558bn at the end of the second quarter, beating analysts’ average estimates.Fastenal, an industrial distributor, posted better-than-expected earnings, boosted by a 20 per cent surge in revenues. But its shares fell 4.1 per cent at $50.44 after rallying more than 22 per cent since the start of the year. Its net income in the quarter was 47 cents per share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 44 cents.
12;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2009-11-13T18:27:23Z;Investors switch back on to tech stocks;;Fund managers who invest in technology and telecoms stocks are sounding increasingly positive about the sector’s prospects compared with other parts of the market.There is widespread belief that the tech sector has “grown up” since the IT bubble was pricked in March 2000. “We managed to get rid of a lot of the rubbish from 2001 through 2003,” says James Gautrey, a technology and telecoms specialist with Schroders. “Some of the companies in existence back then are still here today and I think – by and large – they do still make fairly interesting investments.”These arguments are supported by the fact that tech and telecoms companies’ balance sheets appear strong while their share prices do not look over overvalued on fundamental measures. Many stocks trade on price-to-earnings ratios as low as 10-13 times next year’s earnings.“We believe that many companies in the sector are now in much better shape than several years ago with cash on their balance sheets and valuations that do not look excessive, yet the area remains unloved,” says John Chatfeild-Roberts, head of the Jupiter Independent Funds team.With $30bn in net cash, Microsoft is the sector’s titan. It trades at 16 times forward earnings and yesterday its shares still hovered at less than $30.Schroders’ Gautrey says the company could yet generate a further $18bn to $20bn in yearly net cash, thanks partly to the launch of Windows 7.Tyco Electronics, which trades at about $24 per share, is another favourite of Gautrey who believes its efforts to cut costs and restructure will improve its margins. He also favours Baidu, dubbed China’s Google, and Applied Materials, the US semiconductor group. Now trading at $12.82, Applied Material’s shares have risen about 25 per cent in the last year.A wave of mergers and acquisitions could also boost the sector as more tech companies look to “cross-sell” products.Andrew Williamson Jones, manager of BlackRock’s Global Equity fund, is bullish on telecoms as many stocks offer free cash flow yield of 10 per cent or more and have pared back costs. The chance to earn dividends is another incentive to buy into the sector as yields on telecom stocks are outpacing those of 10-year gilts and US Treasuries.Vodafone, Verizon and AT&T all offer yields of 6 per cent or more while France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom’s yearly payouts are in the 8 to 9 per cent range. “In the rally of the last six months, telecom stocks have been left behind and now trade at a significant discount to the market,” says Williamson Jones.But some advisers encourage clients to gain exposure to tech stocks via general equity funds. “I wouldn’t select a separate tech fund,” says Tim Cockerill, head of research with Rowan & Co, the advisory firm.
13;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2009-06-23T20:37:27Z;Wall Street struggles for direction;;"US stocks struggled for momentum on Tuesday having crashed through several significant support levels during the previous session.An encouraging auction of government debt helped lift stocks during the afternoon. But the markets remained subdued after disappointing news from Boeing suppressed early gains, which came on higher commodities prices and economic optimism.The aircraft manufacturer announced a further delay to its 787 Dreamliner, which is already two years behind schedule, as the company looks to reinforce part of the bodywork. The news sent the shares tumbling 6.5 per cent to $43.87.There was a knock-on effect on other parts of the market, particularly on
Boeing’s suppliers.Honeywell lost 0.5 per cent to $31.43, Rockwell Collins slid 1.2 per cent to $41.91 and Goodrich fell 0.7 per cent to $49.07.Banking stocks also lost ground after initial rises as fresh economic data did not prove as positive as some had hoped.Sales of existing homes rose less than expected in May but most banks managed to hold on to some of their early gains as house prices remained relatively stable and manufacturing rose in the Richmond,
Virginia, area.Bank of America closed up 2.4 per cent at $12.23 and JPMorgan finished 2.1 per cent higher at $33.57.Commodities stocks also made a partial recovery as materials prices rose following a bruising previous session. The price of oil picked up, and was followed by energy companies. Schlumberger rose 1.9 per cent to $53.30 while ConocoPhillips climbed 2 per cent to $41.25.Metal producers were also higher following Monday’s losses. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, climbed 4.4 per cent to $47.18 while AK Steel gained 7.2 per cent to $17.68.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.2 per cent at 895.10 but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 8,322.91 and the Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.1 per cent to 1,764.92.“I don’t think this is the start of a major pull-back,” said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services.“Buyers and sellers have come together and begun to agree on a fair price following the powerful rally, which is why we have seen sideways trade.”But Tim Howkins, chief executive of IG Group, said: “Equities need to go down again. They bounced too quickly and the feeling is we still need to see a
complete capitulation.”The mood on Wall Street was lifted by encouraging words from Moody’s, the rating agency, which said the triple A rating on US debt “remains solid”, easing fears about how costly it could become for the government to borrow and fund its stimulus plans.The optimism surrounding the government’s spending power was later boosted by the afternoon’s auction of Treasury debt.Kroger, the supermarket operator, reported better than expected profits before the market opened but the results failed to provide a fillip for the stock as revenues came in lower than analysts had predicted. The shares slipped 0.1 per cent to $21.76.There was better news for fellow retailer Office Depot, as it received a $350m cash infusion from BC Partners in return for a 20 per cent stake. The stock advanced 2.6 per cent to $3.89.Several pieces of news from the mobile-phone sector buoyed communications and technology companies.Intel rose after Bloom-berg reported that the company had won a contract to supply microchips to Nokia for use in its mobile-phone handsets.The deal would be a breakthrough in Intel’s efforts to secure a foothold in the mobile telephone market, and the shares gained 0.8 per cent to $15.81.Meanwhile, Motorola picked up 4 per cent to $6.27 after Bank of America recommended buying the shares, saying that Motorola was having some success with new handset sales to carriers.Metro PCS, the mobile service operator, climbed on news that it would replace Tyco Electronics in the S&P 500 from June 29. This would mean the company’s shares may be bought by investors trying to track the benchmark index. The stock advanced 5.2 per cent to $14.33. Tyco fell 2.6 per cent to $18.59."
14;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2009-06-16T20:29:29Z;Wall Street slides on consumer spending fears;;US stocks lost early gains on Tuesday as they headed towards a second consecutive session of losses.Investors worried about the health of consumer spending after Best Buy reported weaker sales than expected and falling profits.The company was expected to benefit from the demise of Circuit City, one of its main competitors, but instead it saw revenues fall as customers cut back on spending. The shares lost 7.3 per cent to $35.84.There was some positive news on the sector from Tyco Electronics, which makes electronic connectors. The company said sales had improved in consumer-related markets and profits may be almost three times higher than forecast. Its shares advanced 3.7 per cent to $19.98.But this could not prevent Best Buy’s weak sales from encouraging investors to sell shares in other retailers. Targetfell 3.7 per cent to $38.62 while Home Depot lost 2.7 per cent to $23.20.Stocks had been supported during the morning by rising commodity prices, but these fell again during the afternoon, extending the trend of the previous two sessions, dragging metal producers with them.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, dropped 5 per cent to $52.39 and Alcoa, which produces aluminium, declined 2.8 per cent to $10.90.Steelmakers, which have moved from stellar gains to sharp losses in the past few sessions, intially picked up ground after Nucor said orders had improved over recent weeks, helping it to project a narrower quarterly loss than expected.But Nucor was the only one to hold onto gains amid the sell-off and the shares closed 2.4 per cent up at $46.86.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 1.3 per cent down at 911.97, and 8,504.67 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 1.1 per cent to 1,796.18.“The market is rtrying to figure out right now whether this is some sort of correction that is building or if it is just a break in an extended recovery,” said Larry Coates, chief executive of Oak Value Capital Management.The rising price of commodities, and especially oil, was shown to have pushed inflation up in May as the Producer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent from April.But this was much more moderate than analysts had predicted, easing fears that inflation could hamper stocks later in the year.There was also a boost from figures showing that builders started work on many more homes in May than expected.But some analysts warned the headline figures on housing starts hid worrying trends.“Inventories remain high, and builders seem to be building to compete with cheap foreclosed houses, which will keep the pressure on prices,” said Brett Hryb, portfolio manager with MFC Global Investment Management.The positive effect of the economic data was further tempered by figures showing industrial production in May fell more than analysts had predicted.Healthcare was one of the few sectors to enjoy a positive day as investors bet President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms would have to be scaled back after the Congressional Budget Office said the current plan would leave 30m Americans uninsured.Health insurers have suffered on the White House plans, which include scaling back subsidies for those companies. But as the proposals came under attack, major insurers gained.Aetna rose 4.7 per cent to $23.58 and Coventry Health climbed 3.5 per cent to $16.71.The sector was further boosted by Amgen, the biotechnology company, whose shares climbed 3.6 per cent to $51.21 after they were upgraded by Sanford Bernstein. The broker said revenues and earnings should re-accelerate over the year.Citigroup dropped 3.6 per cent to $3.25 after Vikram Pandit, the chief executive, said companies would have to look elsewhere than American consumption for growth drivers as the US adjusts to slower growth and less credit.AT&T dropped 1.7 per cent to $24.22 meanwhile after its shares were downgraded by Barclays Capital, which said continuing high unemployment would make growth difficult.
15;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2008-08-20T07:56:20Z;Cobham expands US defence operations;;Cobham has made its fifth US acquisition this year, with the purchase of GMS, a digital equipment business owned by Allied Defense Group.The FTSE 100 aerospace and defence group will pay $26m (£14m) for GMS, which is based in Carlsbad, California and mainly supplies US law enforcement, national security and defence organisations.GMS products include video surveillance systems and high definition wireless video technologies used in both standard police operations and in the growing defence market for unmanned aerial and ground vehicles.Cobham has spent $1.1bn this year on its acquisition spree in the US, where it now earns around half its revenues.Earlier this year, Allan Cook, chief executive, said one of his main aims was to raise Cobham’s position, name and reputation among prime contractors such as Northrop Grumann and Raytheon.GMS is the third acquisition in the intelligence, law enforcement and surveillance sector this year. The group acquired MMI Research of the UK in April for £13.6m with an additional £3m payable by 2010 contingent on performance. In June, it paid $407m for Sparta, an unlisted US group specialising in intelligence and missile defence.Other US acquisitions have included the $425m purchase of M/A-Com, which supplies radio frequency components and subsystems, from Tyco Electronics. Completion of this deal is subject to regulatory clearance, as is the GMS acquisition.Cobham’s rivals have also been on the acquisition trail in the US, led by BAE Systems which has been expanding in the homeland security sector.Meggitt, whose products include aircraft brakes and wheels, last year agreed a $1.1bn bid for K&F Industries. Qinetiq, the former state defence research group, made five US acquisitions last year and this month announced the purchase of Dominion Technology Resources.GMS, which will be acquired free of debt and cash, employs 50 people and will become part of Cobham’s Avionics and Surveillance Division. The deal, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, gives it a West Coast presence for its intelligence and surveillance business.Mr Cook said: ”The acquisition of GMS adds proven engineering capability, complementary technologies and exciting opportunities for accelerating growth in the wider homeland security market through our law enforcement and national security business. This will strengthen our position in this rapidly growing market.”Cobham shares rose 2¾p in early trading to 222½p.
16;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Cobham buys Tyco radio unit;;"Cobham took its US acquisition spree to more than $1bn this year with the purchase of a defence electronics supplier.The British aerospace and defence group will pay $425m (£218m) cash for
M/A-Com, a supplier of radio frequency components and subsystems, from Tyco Electronics.Cobham plans to sell on M/A-Com’s commercial products business, which accounts for 60 per cent of its sales, as it is non-core.M/A-Com marks the fourth US acquisition that Cobham has completed or announced this year. On a pro forma basis, it will boost Cobham’s US revenues to more than $1.8bn, according to Allan Cook, chief executive.Before the deal, the largest had been the purchase of Sparta, the intelligence and missile defence company.The US, the world’s largest defence market, has long been a hunting ground for UK companies. BAE Systems, Britain’s largest defence contractor, may have publicly led the charge across the Atlantic, but mid-tier defence companies – most of them flush with cash – have not been far behind.The US spends between 3.5 and 4 per cent of gross domestic product on defence, and UK companies are competing for a slice of the pie.Cobham is no stranger to the US market and supplies prime contractors as well as the Defence Department. Even before the latest deal, almost 50 per cent of its revenues were US-generated.Mr Cook said Cobham still had “money available for strategic acquisitions”.“We have not overpaid for what we believe is a very, very good asset,” he added, saying that the price for the aerospace and defence business represented a multiple of 8 times estimated 2008 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.Cobham’s shares rose 2¼p to 223¼p.FT CommentAllan Cook insists Cobham’s latest acquisition will be earnings-enhancing, but the company is taking on an element of risk as it still needs to find a buyer for M/A-Com’s commercial business. Mr Cook argues that the acquisition is worth it, as it creates critical mass in the area of defence electronics that Cobham has been seeking. It has a record of divesting businesses effectively, but that element of uncertainty will persist until the disposal is completed. The shares are trading on a multiple of 14 times 2009 earnings compared with the sector’s 11 times, according to Numis Securities, which has a “hold” rating on the stock."
17;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2007-08-07T17:30:14Z;Tyco hit by $3.6bn loss;;Tyco, the scandal-tainted conglomerate, on Tuesday said it made a $3.55bn loss in its third quarter after taking charges for the settlement of a class-action lawsuit and break-up costs.The results included a $2.89bn charge, a record for a single firm, after Tyco settled a lawsuit with shareholders who claimed that the company’s leadership engaged in a massive accounting fraud scheme and overstated income.Dennis Kozlowski, the company’s former chief executive, and Mark Swartz, the former finance chief, were convicted in 2005 of looting the company and are now serving jail terms of up to 25 years.The company also took a $343m charge for the spin off of its healthcare and electronics businesses, undertaken in order to shrug off its chequered past and because of an underperforming share price.Ed Breen, chief executive, called the break up “a milestone in Tyco’s history”.Tyco, which makes fire and security systems as well as pipes and valves for the water and energy industries, said it may invest future income in share buybacks or add “bolt-on” acquisitions. “We are not going to sit on any excess cash,” said Mr Breen in a call with analysts.Costs for restructuring, primarily in European security and fire business, may be as high as $400m.The healthcare arm, now called Covidien, reports on Thursday, while Tyco Electronics will reveal its earnings on Wednesday.The loss of $7.18 a share follows net income of $868m, or $1.68 a share, in the same period last year.Earnings from continuing operations before special items rose 10 per cent to $277m, or 55 cents per share, from $252m, or 49 cents a share.Wall Street analysts had expected profit of 47 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.Sales rose 7.8 per cent to $5.09bn. Operating income before special items grew in four of the company’s five divisions.Tyco said it expected fourth quarter sales to be up 6 to 7 per cent. Shares in Tyco fell $1.20 cents to $46.80 following the results.
18;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2007-06-22T20:31:51Z;Blackstone fever fails to lift Wall St;;"Wall Street posted sharp losses this week as investors worried about
elevated long-term bond yields, higher oil prices and the exposure of financial stocks to hedge funds.Not even the successful trading debut for Blackstone, the first private equity firm to list on an exchange, could dispel the bearish gloom.Blackstone began trading at $36.45 a share, about 17 per cent higher than its placement price of $31. The stock closed at $35.06.As a tough week ebbed to a close, the S&P 500 index fell 1.3 per cent to finish at 1,502.66 for a decline of 2 per cent since Monday.Investors on Friday were also mindful that the S&P 500 index and other benchmarks faced a shake-up in their composition. The S&P removed three stocks, PMC Sierra, ADC Telecom and Sanmina-SCI - all technology companies. As from next week, they will be replaced by Tyco Electronics and Covidien, two companies spun off by Tyco, while Discover Financial Services, a spin-off from Morgan Stanley, will also join the S&P.The Russell indexes were also rebalanced on Friday, and that sparked some choppy trading ahead of the close said traders.Among the leading S&P sector groups that led losses, utilities was down 4.4 per cent, healthcare was lower by 3 per cent and financials was off 2.9 per cent for the week.Real estate investment trusts and homebuilders also fell sharply this week.The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1 per cent to close at 2,588.96 yesterday for a fall of 1.4 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4 per cent to 13,360.26 for a slide of 2 per cent this week.Interest-rate sensitive stocks were hurt as the yield on the 10-year bond consolidated near recent highs.Of greater concern for the financial sector, however, was a shake-out at two mortgage hedge funds owned by Bear Stearns.Investors wondered if the episode marked the start of further problems as various banks sought to sell collateral and limit their losses to the hedge funds.Analysts at S&P said: “Recent developments underscore the market and credit risks borne by the major broker dealers as a consequence of their hedge fund investments. This is a sector-wide phenomenon that warrants close scrutiny.”Late on Friday, Bear Stearns was 1.4 per cent lower at $143.75, for a loss of 4.2 per cent this week. The American stock exchange’s Broker/Dealer index declined 1.8 per cent on Friday, for a loss of 3.6 per cent this week.The bearish mood in stocks was also a function of concern over earnings and the economy.“The market is currently a little nerve-wrecking for investors,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global market strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank.He said investors were worried that it was becoming harder for the economy to reflect a “goldilocks mix” whereby growth slows to stall inflation but remains strong enough to keep corporate profit humming along.Meanwhile, more professional investors are betting that stocks will suffer the summer blues.For the month of June, the number of short-selling positions on NYSE rose 6 per cent to 12.47bn shares, a record high.One bright spot this week was a rebound in deal activity after a drought early last week.Nuveen Investments agreed to a $5.75bn private equity buy-out and shares in the investment manager jumped 15.1 per cent to $62.83.Genesco rose 6 er cent to $52.57 this week after Finish Line, down 19.8 per cent at $10.13, agreed to acquire the footwear and accessories retailer.Luxottica rose 3.9 per cent at $37.15 as the Italian eyeware maker bought Oakley, a US rival, in a $2.1bn cash deal valued at $29.30 a share. Oakley rose 12.4 per cent to $28.37 this week.Equity Inns jumped 15.4 per cent to $22.71 this week after the hotel and motel real estate investment trust was bought for about $1.26bn by a private real estate trust.Share buy-backs scaled new heights this week.Buoyed by a $10.3bn sale of its supply unit to private equity firms, Home Depot announced a $22.5bn buyback programme.

19;TEL;Te Connectivity Ltd;2006-01-13T18:43:58Z;Tyco shares plunge as break-up plan unveiled;;The story of Tyco’s rise from obscurity to infamy and back again began a new chapter on Friday as the company announced a long-awaited split.However, the news was overshadowed by the latest in a series of profits warnings.The US conglomerate, built through a flurry of acquisitions by jailed former chief executive Dennis Kozlowski, confirmed plans to break his empire apart into three new companies.But its shares fell nearly 10 per cent in early trading as investors reacted negatively to the latest warning.The fall wiped out two thirds of the gain that Tyco shares have made since it first hinted at a break-up strategy in November.Ed Breen, chairman and chief executive, who led the company’s recovery after an accounting scandal, said the new strategy would show that the sum of the parts was greater than the whole.“Last spring we recognised that Tyco was ready for the second phase of its turnround,” said Mr Breen.The board of directors agreed late on Thursday to break up the company into Tyco Healthcare, Tyco Electronics and a combined Tyco Fire Security and Engineered Products Services.It follows the underperformance of its share price and weak growth in some of its businesses.In 2002, the conglomerate proposed a split but the plan was withdrawn after it emerged that Mr Kozlowski and other senior executives had been involved in accounting fraud.Since then Mr Kozlowski has been convicted for his role in the scandal, and Mr Breen has set the company on the road to recovery. But last year Tyco shares underperformed the broader market by more than a fifth.“After a thorough review of strategic options with our board of directors, we have determined that separating into three independent companies is the best approach to enable these businesses to achieve their full potential,” Mr Breen said.Tyco said the split would be managed through tax-free stock dividends to its shareholders, who would then own 100 per cent of the equity in the three publicly traded companies.Each company will have its own independent board of directors, and the break-up is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2007, Tyco said.One-time transaction costs are expected to total about $1bn, mainly made up of tax and debt refinancing.Separately, Tyco lowered its first-quarter earnings per share outlook to about $0.38 compared with $0.40 to $0.42.
