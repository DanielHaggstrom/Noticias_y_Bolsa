However, the company said it expects operating expenses to rise as much as 10 per cent, driven by increased marketing expenses.The company also forecast that the current expected credit losses, or CECL, rule — an accounting standard that came into effect this month — would increase loan loss reserves by $2.5bn, more than it previously expected. The rule requires lenders to recognise probable loan losses earlier, though the initial impact on reserves does not hit reported profit.Shares in Synchrony Financial, the General Electric spin-off specialising in private-label credit cards for merchants, ended the day almost 10 per cent lower as investors took issue with guidance, despite a solid fourth-quarter result.Net income of $731m met analyst expectations, but the company said 2020 margins would be adversely affected by the sale of the Walmart card loan portfolio and investments in new technology. It forecast an initial reserve impact of $3bn from CECL.Shares in both Discover and Synchrony fell despite broadly stable credit-quality indicators and positive comments about the economic outlook.“For both companies . . . [investors’] real sensitivity has been around, one, the impact of CECL and, two, expenses above expectations,” said analyst John Hecht of Jefferies.Investors responded more favourably to results at American Express, which has a wealthier customer base.Fourth-quarter revenue at Amex rose 9 per cent from the year before, to $11.4bn. Net income and earnings per share, adjusting for a tax benefit in 2018, rose 12 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively.Amex’s strongest growth was in card fees, which rose 20 per cent to $1bn in the quarter. The fees are paid primarily by users of premium cards that provide air miles and other rewards. The company forecast revenue growth of 8-10 per cent in 2020.“We expect card fee revenues will remain the fastest-growing revenue line in 2020,” said Jeff Cambell, Amex’s chief financial officer. American Express said its reserve adjustment for CECL would be $1.7bn.Amex shares closed up 2.9 per cent on Friday.“All three [card companies] are investing for growth, but this affected Discover and Synchrony more, with the CECL impact,” said Sanjay Sakhrani, card analyst at KBW.
1;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2017-11-01T05:00:38Z;Millennials play in the credit card casino;Amex and JPMorgan are the biggest winners from a closed financial system;Kenneth Chenault knows how to play the game of life: the chairman and chief executive of American Express has received at least $370m during his 17-year tenure there. He was declared “the gold standard for corporate leadership”, by Warren Buffett, a long-time Amex investor, when he announced his departure.Mr Chenault also knows when to take his chips off the table. The US credit card business, especially for high end cards such as Amex Platinum, is more competitive than it used to be. A points scramble has intensified since JPMorgan Chase launched its Sapphire Reserve card last year, with an annual fee of $450 and an initial sign-up bonus worth $1,500 in points.His departure is an opportunity to ask questions about how card companies prosper, particularly in the US. The Supreme Court this month agreed to hear a case challenging Amex’s practice of barring merchants from steering customers towards cards that charge lower transaction fees. The ultimate question is who loses and who wins in what is an oddly structured market.The traditional answer to the question is clear enough: people who pay for goods and service in cash lose, while card holders gain. As one study found, it involves “a regressive transfer from low income to high income consumers . . . amplified substantially by the practice of paying rewards”.This is how the transfer works: companies such as Visa, MasterCard and Discover levy a charge on sellers of two per cent for each transaction (Amex’s average merchant charge is 2.4 per cent, which is why it tries to stop steering). Stores are barred by contract from charging card users more, so prices rise about 1 per cent for everyone, whether they pay by cash or card.Some of the fees are channelled back by credit card companies to their customers in rewards and, since Discover launched the first cashback card in 1986, cash rebates averaging 1 to 2 per cent. Since rewards cards such as Amex tend to be held by people with prime credit scores, they gain most.The big winner is the house, as in any casino. Amex charged $18.7bn in merchant fees last year and paid out $6.8bn in rewardsRecently, the market has become more like a game. The Sapphire Reserve card shook up Amex by offering top users superior rewards in return for a large annual fee. Those who play their cards right, earning triple points for travel and dining, can gain high returns. A Sapphire Reserve card holder could gain $7,950 net of fees over 10 years, Barclays analysts estimate.This has sparked a contest among millennials with good credit, an aptitude for games, and time to plan their spending cleverly. Some apply for multiple cards to maximise rewards, unlike traditional users. “The question is not just how much disposable income you have but how much disposable time,” says Robert Harrow, an analyst at the research group ValuePenguin.The contest has made life less comfortable for Amex, which had to raise its rewards by 21 per cent in the third quarter of this year. The total rewards paid by the top six US card issuers doubled to $23bn between 2010 and 2016, attracting more people to use credit. US credit card debt now exceeds $1tn, and Americans rate credit cards as their favourite payment method.Like casinos, card issuers do not want their customers to master their games too well. Casinos frown on blackjack players who change the odds by counting cards, although it is legal. Both Amex and JPMorgan strive to prevent people signing up for cards for welcome rewards and later dropping them. Amex changed its terms this year to prohibit “abuse, misuse or gaming”.The big winner is the house, as in any casino. Amex charged $18.7bn in merchant fees last year and paid out $6.8bn in rewards. Most card users are not single-minded enough to obtain the highest potential returns. Discover card holders can get 5 per cent cash back per quarter on $1,500 of purchases in some categories, but its average rewards rate is only 1.3 per cent.Amex gains most from what it calls its “closed loop” — it issues cards and handles transactions. Its degree of control has similarities to Nintendo, which sells both consoles and games and this week raised sales projections for its Switch console. Complete control has its privileges: Amex’s US card business made a 35 per cent return on capital last year, far higher than investment banks.The growth of super-prime cards has increased competition but it ultimately reinforces the credit card networks. The largest transfer of wealth is now from poorer cash buyers to millennial gamers but the latter have to work hard for their points and are rewarded in the currency of the card issuer.While rewards have risen, little has affected where they come from — the US card market’s high transaction fees. Unlike the EU, which capped some transaction fees in 2015, the US relies largely on competition to minimise card purchasing costs and the price distortions that they create.To judge by the profitability of Amex and others, competition is not working as well as it should. More of the “swipe economics” of transactions are being passed through to the most energetic users but there is room for reform in the market as a whole.

2;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2017-08-17T01:28:14Z;US companies crack down on key services for hate groups;Move to halt access to funds adds to Silicon Valley squeeze on internet use;US companies are blocking hate groups from key services such as payments, cyber security defences and social media sites after the violence in Charlottesville, despite questions over the consequences for freedom of speech.Leading payment and credit card groups MasterCard, American Express, Discover Financial Services and Visa have joined Silicon Valley companies Twitter and Cloudflare to become the latest corporations to try to block neo-Nazis’ access to funds and the internet.Several of the payments companies said they did not ban the use of their services because the customers expressed offensive views but because they violated their terms of service or incited violence.Discover said “in light of recent events” it was “terminating merchant agreements with hate groups, given the violence incited by their extremist views”.MasterCard said it was “shutting down the use of our cards on sites that we believe incite violence, as well as those who are wrongfully suggesting they accept our cards, when in fact they don’t”.American Express said it was reviewing websites brought to its attention by activists and would take “appropriate action”.Visa said “a number of” sites it reviewed had engaged in illegal activities or failed to meet issuers’ acceptable-use policies.PayPal has also stopped enabling money transfers to websites that violate its policies by promoting “hate, violence or racial intolerance”.The payments companies had come under pressure from activists such as Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, who said they were “making hundreds of thousands of dollars from processing fees for these racist groups and quite literally profiting off hate and murder”.Apple confirmed on Wednesday that it had pulled support for a handful of white supremacist sites that had been using its online payments service to sell merchandise such as T-shirts and bumper stickers bearing Nazi logos and slogans. Guidelines for Apple Pay state that sites “may not incorporate Apple Pay into a website that promotes hate, violence, or intolerance based on race, age, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation”, while the iPhone’s App Store also prohibits various kinds of “objectionable content”.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, was quick to condemn the weekend’s violence in Charlottesville, tweeting on Monday morning: “We’ve seen the terror of white supremacy & racist violence before. It’s a moral issue — an affront to America. We must all stand against it.”Elsewhere in Silicon Valley, Twitter and Cloudflare have also joined a tech industry effort to block neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer from the internet. The site posted an offensive article about the woman who died in the white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend.The San Francisco-based messaging platform appeared to have suspended several accounts that are associated with the website, such as @dailystormer and @dailystormers, but did not respond to a request for comment.Cloudflare ended its business with the site, which it protected from distributed denial of service attacks designed to take it offline.Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, said he was also worried about the consequences of the “dangerous” decision he made to drop the site. He was concerned that it could lead to “vigilante justice”, where hackers can launch attacks because no one will protect certain sites, and questioned whether it made his company more vulnerable to a government pressuring them to take down a site.In the end, Mr Prince said he decided to remove the site after a Daily Stormer commenter claimed Cloudflare was “one of us” and he did not want the company to appear to sympathise with readers of the neo-Nazi site. “We could not remain neutral after these claims of secret support by Cloudflare,” he said in a blog post.The tech companies follow GoDaddy, the world’s largest domain registrar, which removed the site. The Daily Stormer then tried to switch to Google Domains but Google said it would not host the site because it represented an “incitement to violence”. The Daily Stormer then transferred to a Russian domain name, but that can no longer be reached, probably because it is no longer protected from hackers attempting to take it offline.Facebook and Reddit have removed several white nationalist groups, while Spotify, the music streaming service, said it had removed tracks by “hate bands” as classified by the Southern Poverty Law Center.But some believe tech companies are overstepping their role by effectively banning sites from the internet.Nate Cardozo, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit defending digital privacy and free speech online, said there is a difference between Facebook deciding content violates its policies in its walled garden, and infrastructure providers “pulling the plug”.“If an internet service provider wants to deny me the opportunity to read offensive speech like the Daily Stormer, that’s a problem,” he said. “There doesn’t seem to be any suggestion the Daily Stormer was hosting illegal content, just terrible content. We should be able to see it and reject it.”Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw in Los Angeles

However, the BofA survey showed that while investors thought a British exit, or Brexit, would be the biggest tail risk for the world economy, two-thirds thought that result “unlikely” or “not at all likely”.“Quantitative failure”, or the diminishing power of central bank bond-buying to stimulate growth, and the risk of a Chinese devaluation or default were the second- and third-largest tail risks.Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, the Vix, a barometer of expected volatility on the S&P 500 index over the next 30 days, has jumped 44 per cent this month.“The volatility spike we have seen is just remarkable,” said Randy Frederick at Charles Schwab. “This move is one you would expect to see when the S&P drops 200 points versus the 30 we’ve seen in the last few days,” he added.On Tuesday the Vix was up 2.2 per cent amid a fourth straight day of declines in the US stock market.By the close the S&P 500 had declined 0.2 per cent to 2,075.3 — its longest losing streak since February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 17,674.8, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent lower at 4,843.6.Shares of Synchrony Financial had their sharpest daily decline since the consumer finance company went public in 2014 after it warned that loan write-offs could climb over the next year.“While the loss rate in our portfolio is at historically low levels, we very recently finished our loss forecast, and we are now expecting a 20-30 basis point increase in our net charge-off rates as we look out over the next 12 months,” Synchrony said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Synchrony, which was spun off from General Electric, said it would increase its reserves for loan losses, or set-asides for future liabilities, beginning in the current quarter. The shares slid 13.1 per cent to $26.45.Other credit card issuers faced selling pressure. American Express fell 4.1 per cent to $61.07 while Discover Financial dropped 4.1 per cent to $53.27.
4;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2016-04-25T18:30:19Z;Talwar has big task as Goldman Sachs moves into online lending;Head of bank’s division has made senior staff hires in drive for new sources of revenue;Harit Talwar has a big job on his hands.Hired as a partner last year by Goldman Sachs in New York, he is spearheading a move into online lending, which is part of a broad effort by the Wall Street investment bank to open up new sources of revenue.The former president of the US credit-card business at Discover Financial Services has since hired senior executives from regulators and rivals — and through this month’s acquisition of a $16bn book of deposits from GE Capital, has given himself an advantage over non-bank rivals dependent on fickle wholesale markets for funding.“That’s the ultimate, the lowest cost of capital imaginable,” said Jared Hecht, co-founder and chief executive of Fundera, a small-business lending portal. “Being dependent on one or two institutional investors can go south very quickly, depending on how the winds blow.”Goldman is determined to make a success of its new venture lending to consumers and small businesses, which is known internally as Mosaic and is on course to launch by the end of the year. After all, other units are hardly firing on all cylinders. The core trading division has been sputtering for a while, slowed by tougher regulation and choppy markets. The investing and lending division, a ragbag of businesses involving Goldman placing bets with its own capital, had a particularly difficult time in the first quarter, as the bank posted its lowest return on equity of the past four years.Analysts have questioned whether Goldman is doing enough to reinvent itself, noting that the stock price — hovering at about $165 on Monday — is exactly where it was 10 years ago.When Dick Bove, a veteran analyst at Rafferty & Co, asked last week why Goldman was apparently baulking at “transformational change”, he drew a prickly response from Harvey Schwartz, chief financial officer.“We’re [not] sitting here waiting for the world to do what it does,” Mr Schwartz said, on the bank’s earnings call. “If we felt there was a client segment or a transaction we could do that would benefit our shareholders and we could deliver to those clients, we would do it. We’re open-minded.”Hence the move into online lending, seeking to match the explosive growth of companies such as Lending Club and Prosper. In a report last year, Goldman analysts said that $4.6bn of big-bank profits could be lost to the digital upstarts, which could capture up to 15 per cent of the $843bn worth of outstanding consumer loans within a few years.For now, the online-lending industry as a whole is “somewhat sceptical” that a big bank such as Goldman can be as “nimble” as the leaders, said Brian Korn, a partner at law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips in New York.But Mr Talwar has been busily filling out his bench. Key hires include Mitch Hochburg, a former official at the Washington-based Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who arrived as chief compliance officer in January. Greg Berry, an ex-Visa and PayPal executive, came on board in November as chief architect, shortly after Darin Cline arrived after a two-year stint as senior vice-president of operations at San Francisco-based Lending Club.Goldman Sachs, the go-to bank of the rich and powerful, is moving into consumer lending and consumer savingsStephen Scherr, a 23-year Goldman veteran who was promoted to a new position of chief strategy officer two years ago, noted that ructions in credit markets since the turn of the year had increased pressure on many of the 400 or so online lenders in the US, forcing them to redouble efforts to secure stable funding.But that only played to the advantage of Goldman, he said, which became America’s fourth-biggest bank holding company during the financial crisis by rolling its deposit-taking units into GS Bank.“Our enthusiasm remains high given what we have learned over the course of building our business,” he said.
5;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2015-12-11T06:13:19Z;US banks prepare for assault from online rivals;Imminent interest rate rise from Federal Reserve intensifies war for deposits;The big brick-and-mortar banks in the US are bracing themselves for a fresh assault from rapidly growing online lenders, as an imminent interest rate rise from the Federal Reserve intensifies a war for deposits.The big retail banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have been eagerly anticipating the advent of higher rates, as loans and other assets with floating rates instantly offer more income. But at a conference in New York this week, executives appeared wary of the effects on the other side of their balance sheets, suggesting that depositors could be lured away by better rates elsewhere.Since the Fed last raised rates in 2006, the banking landscape in the US has changed radically, with specialty finance outfits such as Ally Financial, American Express and Discover Financial Services converting to bank holding companies in the wake of the crisis to access the Fed’s support programmes.Lower cost structures allow these new banks to offer significantly higher rates on deposits — a spread that could widen, once the Fed pulls the trigger and the newcomers compete more aggressively for funds.“If rates finally go [up], it’s going to be the headline on every newspaper for two weeks running,” said William Demchak, chairman and chief executive of PNC Financial Services, a top-five bank by deposits in nine states across the US, at the New York conference, which was put together by Goldman Sachs. “It’s going to wake up consumers [to say], ‘I should be doing something about something. I don’t know what it is yet, but I’m going to figure it out.’”Seven years of near rock-bottom rates have eaten into the traditional banks’ margins, forcing them to cut staff and shut branches. Once rates begin to pick up, the banks are counting on earning a bigger margin between what they pay for funding and what they charge to lend, on the assumption that they can hold off from offering higher rates to depositors.One senior executive at a top US bank said that deposit rates are already much higher at internet lenders, but people do not move because “there is real value in having a safe, convenient, nationwide checking system.”But once the rate cycle begins in earnest, “dragging feet” on giving depositors a better deal could be costly, said Bill Carcache, an analyst at Nomura. He notes that the top eight internet banks have increased their combined deposits from $102bn in the first quarter of 2009 to $247bn in the second quarter this year, pushing their share of the US total from 1.1 per cent to 2.1 per cent.All remain keen to support growth in assets by attracting more deposits, which is seen by regulators as the most solid and dependable form of funding in the event of a crisis.If Janet Yellen, Fed chair, does achieve the long-awaited “lift off” next week, then savers across the US are likely to become more sensitive to rates, said Gary Zimmerman, a former Citigroup banker. He now runs MaxMyInterest, which allows depositors to improve returns by sweeping pools of savings around multiple accounts.“For the past few years people have resigned themselves to the idea that cash is a zero-return asset class, which is patently false,” he said.On bankrate.com, a portal for comparing products, Synchrony Bank is currently advertising a snowman-themed savings account at 1.05 per cent a year on all balances — 10 times the national average — urging customers not to “let this great offer melt away”.More online lenders such as Synchrony, which was spun out of GE Capital last year, are bracing themselves for battle, said Amol Shah, a director at AlixPartners, a consultancy.“This is one of the best opportunities they’ve had in over a decade,” he said.
6;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2015-06-15T23:15:59Z;Goldman joins online lenders’ club;Wall St titan seeks to disrupt the disrupters with direct loans venture;"Six months ago Goldman Sachs was a lead underwriter on the initial public offering of Lending Club, the biggest and brashest of a new breed of online lenders. Now the Wall Street titan is looking to disrupt the disrupters, launching its own web-based business offering loans to consumers and small businesses.In an internal memo last month the bank said it had hired a senior executive from Discover Financial Services to lead a new business providing “digitally-led banking services . . . without the burdens of legacy costs and fixed infrastructure”.In doing so, Goldman joins a cluster of companies using online platforms to provide capital to borrowers quickly and directly, bypassing the traditional bricks-and-mortar lenders. Such online operators have enjoyed explosive growth in recent years, amid rapid development of data-crunching software and a surge of interest from yield-starved investors. San Francisco-based Lending Club is now extending close to $2bn of loans a quarter; its nearest rival, Prosper, is doing almost $1bn.Goldman’s new business is led by Harit Talwar, who left his job as head of card services at Discover, the direct banking and payment services company, in April. In a mark of the importance Goldman has attached to the move, Mr Talwar has joined as one of Goldman’s 400 or so partners — a distinction rarely awarded to lateral hires and even more rarely to those launching new businesses.Announcing Mr Talwar’s appointment, chief executive Lloyd Blankfein and chief operating officer, Gary Cohn, said: “The traditional means by which financial services are delivered to consumers and small businesses is being fundamentally reshaped by advances in technology, maturity of digital channels, use of data and analytics, and a focus on customer experience”.Goldman’s research division published a widely-read report in March on the future of finance and the impact of technology, identifying $1.7tn of consumer and small-business loans that it said could be “served more efficiently through the online lenders”.Patrick Jenkins and guests discuss rising tensions in Greece, Royal Bank of Scotland’s preparations for the re-privatisation process, with special guest Sir Phillip Hampton, RBS’s outgoing chairman, and Goldman Sachs decision to start direct lending.Rather than using a peer-to-peer model — matching borrowers and investors through the online platform — Goldman will look to fund loans directly via its New York State-chartered banking subsidiary, which was set up after Goldman became a bank-holding company in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. To date, the unit — with $128bn in assets at the end of March — has mostly provided loans to private clients and institutions.Much of Lending Club’s growth has come from consumers keen to refinance credit-card debt, where the average annual interest rate is more than 17 per cent. A lower cost base and “better risk-based pricing” allows Lending Club to offer three-year loans about 30 per cent cheaper, according to chief executive, Renaud Laplanche.Online lending can still offer attractive returns to investors, meanwhile, even if delinquencies rise sharply from today’s very low levels. New York-based OnDeck Capital, for example — which has supplied about $2bn of high-interest loans to 30,000 small businesses — has made allowances for losses equivalent to about 10 per cent of its $556m loan book. “If you’re charging 40-plus per cent and your loss rate is 10 per cent, that’s still an extremely profitable business,” said Mark Palmer, an analyst at BTIG.One senior figure within the online lending industry welcomed Goldman’s entry but said its size was no guarantee of success.“We’ve seen large groups try to enter nimble markets unsuccessfully; they often end up having to go back and acquire one of the major players to enter the business in a meaningful way,” the person said. “Incumbents have made it look easy — but it isn’t.”"

While investment banks for the most part expect an increase in June, markets continue to wager that it will not arrive until September or October.Outside Washington, attention will centre on the UK budget, Israeli elections and the next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme. Below are a few of the main events to watch in the week ahead.Federal ReserveThe US central bank will hold a critical meeting this week after laying the groundwork earlier this year for the first rate rise since the financial crisis. Economists on Wall Street expect the Fed to remove the word “patient” from its policy statement on Wednesday, signalling that the first increase could come in the next few months. Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Fed will testify following the release.UK BudgetGeorge Osborne, UK chancellor of the exchequer, delivers his final budget of this parliament on Wednesday; the country’s general election takes place in May. The budget may include tax cuts in an attempt to soften austerity measures before voters go to the polls in an election whose outcome is hard to predict.Israeli electionIsraelis head to the polls on Tuesday in a hotly contested election between Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Isaac Herzog, the centre-left opposition leader. Mr Herzog is the frontrunner and recent polls showed his alliance, the Zionist Union, three or four seats ahead in its attempt to lead the next coalition government in the Knesset.IranThe next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme begin in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Sunday and are expected to last at least five days. Mohammad Javad, the Iranian foreign minister, will meet John Kerry, US secretary of state, and policy makers from the six world powers to seek an agreement before the self-imposed June deadline.EarningsThe US fourth-quarter earnings season has largely drawn to a close, with just three S&P 500 listed companies yet to report. In the coming week one of the remaining multinationals, Tiffany & Co, will report. First-quarter results will also start to trickle out, with figures due from FedEx, Nike, Oracle, Lennar and General Mills.Outside the US, BMW, Enel, Porsche, Cathay Pacific, Finmeccanica and China Mobile report earnings.The Week That Was, In Four ChartsThe slide in the euro accelerated against the US dollar in the latest week, prompting some investment banks to forecast that the two currencies will go to parity, as the European Central Bank unleashed its bond-buying programme. On Friday the euro dipped below 1.05 to the dollar, a 12-year low.The slide in the euro has provided a fillip for European corporates exposed to the US market; these groups must convert earnings abroad back into the bloc’s currency. That, coupled with the start of quantitative easing, has sent investors piling into European stocks as they exit the US.US equity markets found some comfort from the heady pace of buybacks, which when coupled with dividends surpassed the $900bn mark last year for the first time. The consistent buying of stock by US corporates reached $553.2bn in 2014, according to data from S&P Dow Jones indices.Financials staved off losses recorded by much of the broader market after the Fed did not fail any of the big US banks’ capital plans, paving the way for a rise in dividends and share buybacks.

In public, they say that the two-part exam — which became an annual event in 2011 — is proving to be a useful discipline, forcing them to get a much better grip on the particular risks they are facing. Privately, they grumble about overkill, denouncing an opaque and expensive process that takes up too much of management’s time.Continue readingThe Santa Clara, California-based company now expects first-quarter revenues to range between $12.5bn and $13.1bn, compared with earlier forecasts for $13.2bn to $14.2bn. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast the company would report sales of $13.7bn in the quarter to the end of March.“The company believes the changes to demand and inventory patterns are caused by lower than expected Windows XP refresh in small and medium business and increasingly challenging macroeconomic and currency conditions, particularly in Europe,” the company said in a statement, referring to the Microsoft software.Microsoft shares slid 2 per cent to $41.02.Overall, the gains by the financial sector, along with a larger than expected slide in initial jobless claims, buoyed the wider market.The S&P 500 climbed 1.3 per cent to 2,065.95, returning to the level at which it opened the year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.5 per cent to 17,895.22.

Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
10;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2014-06-19T16:47:40Z;Credit card companies report higher lending levels;;Three of the largest US credit card issuers have reported higher levels of lending – prompting analysts to suggest the industry has finally reached a turning point, after the damaging effects of the financial crisis.American Express, Capital One and Discover Financial Services all recorded faster loan growth in their domestic card businesses in May, according to filings posted this week – adding to data showing stronger demand for revolving consumer credit in April.Analysts have been looking for green shoots in the US credit card business ever since banks tightened their lending requirements, in response to the bad debts incurred in the wake of the financial crisis. Consumption has been sluggish in the wake of the recession as households sought to repair their balance sheets. But analysts suggest the revival of credit card debt is another sign that the process is nearing an end – boosting the chances of faster economic growth this year.“I’m pretty convinced we’ve hit this inflection point,” said Donald Fandetti, an analyst at Citigroup. “All of a sudden, consumers feel a little bit better, on top of that – from what we hear anecdotally – we think the banks are increasing credit lines for cardholders.” He now expects loan growth to be somewhere between a little more than zero and 4 per cent.Capital One achieved its first positive loan growth in almost a year in May, with a year-on-year increase of 0.15 per cent. But, stripping out the effect of running-off its HSBC credit portfolio acquisition and other purchases, its core loan growth was 1 per cent, Citigroup’s analysts said – the first acceleration since before the credit crisis.At Amex, US card loans grew 6.1 per cent year on year, beating Barclays analysts’ estimates of 3.4 per cent and the previous month’s increase of 5.4 per cent. Meanwhile, at Discover, domestic card loan growth accelerated 6.3 per cent in May compared with 5.3 per cent the month earlier.These increases comes after a strong increase in revolving consumer credit across the broader US economy. In April, the monthly increase in outstanding revolving credit reached 12.3 per cent on an annualised seasonally-adjusted basis, according to the Federal Reserve.“While total consumer debt has been growing, there’s been almost no revolving, credit card loan growth ever since we bottomed, post-recession,” noted Mark DeVries, analyst at Barclays in New York.However, card issuers have found that US consumers are becoming more comfortable with credit card debt, and instances of falling behind with payments – known as delinquencies – have slowed as cardholders skip fewer paymentsMay’s Master Trust data – which also captures the performance of US banks’ securitised credit card portfolios– showed that average delinquency ratios in May were at a ten-year low of 2 per cent.Credit cards remain a profitable business for banks and card companies. Securitised portfolios of credit card debt currently yield around 18 per cent on average – which is historically low, but still rewarding for banks when their own borrowing costs are cheap.“I don’t think anybody is so optimistic to think we’ll get back to double-digit growth like we had before the recession,” said Matthew Burnell, bank analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. “But, it looks like credit card balance growth is starting to become a bit more obvious.”Additional reporting by Robin Harding
11;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2014-04-09T20:44:12Z;BofA agrees $772m credit card settlement;;For Bank of America’s credit card customers, paying a little extra to the bank was a means to protect themselves against the worries of meeting card payments if they lost their job or became ill.But US regulators found the bank had misled more than a million customers over products that were meant to make them feel more financially secure, in some cases charging them without giving them the promised protection or making the benefits sound much better than they were.BofA on Wednesday became the latest big US bank to be fined for tricking customers into buying add-on credit card protection products. It agreed to a $772m settlement with US regulators, the largest of five similar credit card deals to be hammered out by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.“We have seen several cases of deceptive marketing and illegal billing in this market. Here, Bank of America was doing both,” said Richard Cordray, director of the CFPB.The CFPB added that telemarketers “often went off script to make sales pitches that were misleading and that omitted pertinent information”.The settlement covers the sale of two credit protection products, which allowed customers to cancel credit card debt in the case of changing life events, such as involuntary unemployment or going to college.The CFPB found that the bank sold identity protection without having the appropriate permissions from the customer to activate the product. BofA said it had stopped marketing both products by August 2012.Of the $772m levied, the bank will pay only $45m in fines to regulators, with $727m refunded to consumers. The settlement included a $20m payment to the CFPB, the consumer regulator created from the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010, and a $25m penalty to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.BofA said: “The company has already issued refund payments to the majority of affected customers.” The bank neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.We have seen several cases of deceptive marketing and illegal billing in this market. Here, Bank of America was doing bothLast year, JPMorgan Chase had to refund $309m to customers and pay an $80m fine to settle allegations it wrongly charged consumers for credit monitoring programmes that they did not actually receive. Credit card companies American Express, Discover Financial and Capital One have also agreed to settlements with the CFPB.BofA’s worst offences included misleading customers that the first 30 days of coverage were free of charge. In fact, they were charged for the products and then refunded if they cancelled within a 30-day period, according to the CFPB. The bank also told that they faced further steps to activate a product when in fact they had already been enrolled and were paying for the products, the CFPB said.The regulator said the bank went as far as to promise a $25,000 “death benefit”, allowing customers to believe that this benefit was automatic when in reality customers had to submit paperwork and secure approval.BofA last month agreed to a $9.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency over misleading mortgage sales practices.
12;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2014-04-03T23:11:51Z;BofA in talks to pay $800m in credit card case;;Bank of America is in talks to pay about $800m to settle allegations it misled customers who were sold additional credit card products, in what could mark the largest settlement yet levied by the US’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Discussions are continuing and a final deal has not yet been reached between BofA and the consumer regulator, which was created from the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010, people familiar with the matter said. BofA and the CFPB declined to comment.The regulator has been cracking down on companies accused of selling add-on credit card products to consumers without being transparent about the costs. The regulator, under director Richard Cordray, has been increasingly flexing its muscles across consumer banking – from mortgage servicing practices to credit card sales.A final agreement with BofA would mark an important step in its broader investigation that started with enforcement against Capital One in July 2012.Last year, JPMorgan Chase had to refund $309m to customers and pay an $80m fine to settle allegations it wrongly charged consumers for credit monitoring programmes that they did not actually receive.JPMorgan’s case related to an offering at the bank to monitor customers’ credit and alert them to potentially fraudulent activities. Some customers were charged for the service but never authorised the process as is required by law and hence never received the benefits.GE’s retail finance business, Synchrony, has also warned of the threat of regulatory uncertainty, particularly from the CFPB, as it prepares for its initial public offering.Credit card companies American Express and Discover Financial have also agreed to settlements with the CFPB.The $2.2tn US credit card industry is particularly competitive and as post-crisis regulation has been implemented banks have looked to rewards programmes to differentiate themselves from their rivals.Card issuers are positioning themselves to benefit from the early stages of economic recovery, as improving credit quality and consumer confidence are translating into lower defaults and higher spending on cards.The CFPB has also targeted non-bank mortgage servicers such as Ocwen Financial over concerns about the treatment of ‘underwater borrowers’, or borrowers whose mortgages are larger than the value of their house.The largest non-bank mortgage servicing company in the US reached a $2.1bn deal with state and federal authorities to resolve allegations that it took advantage of homeowners, provided false information and charged unauthorised fees.However, the agreement included a commitment to reduce principal balances for underwater borrowers by $2bn over the next three years. Principal forgiveness does not cost Ocwen “other than the operating expense incurred in arranging the modification”, the company said.

It was sandwiched by the blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 1.3 per cent to 11153.91, and the smaller cap Nasdaq Composite index, which fell 0.4 per cent to 2,480.76.“Investors are heading to the safety of names offering quality and yield,” said Andrew Wilkinson, Chief Economic Strategist at Miller Tabak.“Risks appear to be rising as the month ends: Not something that was on the cards first thing this morning,”In the first minutes of trading the S&P had surged 2 per cent on news that the latest eurozone bailout packaged had passed a key vote in the German parliament, and an upward revision to second quarter growth data.Financials led the way, eventually closing up 2.8 per cent with life insurers faring particularly well.Genworth Financial closed up 7.8 per cent to $6.00 and Lincoln National Corporation up 5.6 per cent to $16.46.Investment bank Morgan Stanley jumped 6.6 per cent to $15.09 and rival Goldman Sachs was up 3.7 per cent to $99.87, although Deutsche Bank predicted Goldman would delcare a loss this quarter.Discover Financial Services, the Illinois-based credit card company, fell 1.2 per cent to $23.60 after revealing regulators plan to bring an enforcement case over its marketing of fee-based products.But it was a strange rally, with defensive utility stocks the second best performing sector in the S&P 500, ending the day up 1.5 per cent, and cyclical consumer discretionary and tech stocks down, 0.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.Advanced Micro, a semiconductor manufacturer, which supplies personal computer companies, fell 13.7 per cent to $5.31 after the California-based company reduced its forecast for quarterly revenue and gross margins.“We believe AMD had a tremendous opportunity to gain revenue share in notebooks this year,” Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote to clients. “However, a lack of component supply has been a major impediment to growth and will probably not be resolved in the near term.”Fellow semiconductor stock Micron Technology, which was set to declare results after the bell Thursday, was also down 4.1 per cent to $5.87.Consumer discretionary stocks were led down by internet stocks Amazon, off 3.2 per cent to $222.44 and Netflix, down 10.9 per cent to $113.19.James Cordwell, tech analyst at Atlantic Equities, said Netflix was suffering a “slow bleed” because of investor uncertainty over the company’s strategy, in the wake of a decision to separate the physical DVD delivery and streaming businesses.Several traders speculated that mutual funds were dumping small cap and less well known stocks ahead of the quarter end, when they will have to reveal holidings to clients.But others said the move to more liquid, highly traded stocks, made strategic sense.“It’s much more difficult to get out [of small caps] in a really bad market. It’s telling you the market is by no means assured that Europe has a handle on things.” said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at Icap.US-listed Chinese stocks had a rough day after the Securities and Exchange Commission said the Justice Department is looking into allegations of accounting fraud.Sina Corporation, the e-commerce and social networking site, fell 9.7 per cent to $73.23. Youku, the recently listed video-streaming website fell 18.3 per cent to $16.25.Edwards LifeSciences tumbled after the administrator of the government’s Medicare and Medicaid programmes dealt a blow to hopes of a rapid roll-out for its new cardiovascular device.The medical device manufacturer is banking on strong revenue from its transcatheter aortic-valve implant (TAVI) device, a treatment for aortic stenosis – a heart disorder – that does not involve an operation.On Thursday, the Centre for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS) began the process for considering covering TAVI under the government’s health programmes.CMS approval would normally lead to private insurers following suit.But CMS suggested that trials be limited to patients deemed inoperable rather than include patients seeking an alternative to operations.“We think TAVI will deliver very good growth for Edwards in the long-term,” said Jason Mills, medical devices analyst at Cannacord Genuity. “But we think the consensus expectations on Wall Street have been too agressive on rollout in the first few years and that’s what’s suggested by CMS today.”Edwards shares fell 6.6 per cent to $70.87.Mosaic, the phosphate and potash producer, fell 5.2 per cent to $54.20 after reporting earnings of $1.17 a share for the quarter ended August 31.

Yahoo owns about 40 per cent of Alibaba.These losses followed a 7.3 per cent drop in Yahoo shares on Wednesday after the original announcement that Alibaba had offloaded the fast-growing online payment unit. Alibaba Group has denied that it sold the asset without board approval.Elsewhere in the sector, shares in Nvidia, the chipmaker, fell 10.9 per cent to $18.26 after its first-quarter results failed to impress investors. Shares in sector peer CA suffered a similar fate, dropping 8.6 per cent to $22.90 after its fourth-quarter results.These losses left the S&P technology sector down 1.2 per cent, making it one of the worst performing sectors on Wall Street, and helped knock the S&P 500 down 0.8 per cent to 1,337.77. The benchmark index was down 0.2 per cent over the week.Financial stocks also helped to drive the S&P 500 lower on Friday, as the sector suffered from renewed unease over the mounting debt crisis in Greece.JPMorgan Chase was down 2.1 per cent to $43.15 while SunTrust Banks fell 2.2 per cent to $27.47. The S&P financial index, the worst performing sector on Wall Street, lost 1.5 per cent.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.8 per cent to 12,595.52 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index 1.2 per cent lower at 2,828.47.The Nasdaq was flat over the week and the Dow fell 0.3 per cent over the period.Losses on Friday were limited by some upbeat data showing a rise in consumer confidence this month. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 72.4 for May, a three-month high, as Americans turned more optimistic about the economy.Separately, the consumer price index of inflation showed that prices had not risen dramatically in May, with the price of goods excluding food and energy gaining a modest 0.2 per cent.The week on Wall Street began with strong gains as the markets recovered from 1.7 per cent losses in the previous week and sentiment continued to ride high following bumper official employment numbers on Friday.“The jobs data on Friday were off the charts,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, lifting sentiment on Wall Street for the first few days of the week.But on Wednesday the rebound was derailed by a sharp drop in commodity prices, which dragged down the energy and material sectors. Energy and material stocks fell 3 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively over the day, leading the benchmark S&P 500 index down 1.1 per cent to its worst one day drop in nearly two months.This left the S&P energy index down 1.4 over the week and the materials index 1.9 per cent lower. Both indices are down 7 per cent and 5 per cent respectively so far in May.Transportation stocks failed to rise during the week, despite a further fall in oil prices, indicating that investors were afraid that the high oil price could hurt economic growth.The Dow Jones Transportation Average was 1.6 per cent lower over the week and the S&P airline index was 0.3 per cent lower.“The real disappointment this week was that the fall in oil prices did not energise the markets outside the energy sector,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.Microsoft’s $8.5bn acquisition of Skype was the big deal news of the week, and left shares in the technology group down 3.3 per cent to $25.03 over the five days.Goldman Sachs shares fell 5.6 per cent over the week to $141.46 after Wall Street analysts said the bank could still face charges from the US Department of Justice for its conduct during the financial crisis.Dick Bove of Rochdale Securities on Thursday dropped Goldman to “sell”, while Chris Maimone of Standard & Poor’s lowered his rating to “hold”.Citigroup lost 8.1 per cent to $41.53 after putting into effect a one-for-10 reverse stock split on Monday.These losses helped the S&P financial index drop 2.1 per cent over the week.Elsewhere, Hertz made a $2.2bn offer for Dollar Thrifty, sending shares in the takeover target up 17.3 per cent to $81.83 over the week.

Earnings per diluted share were $3.94, up from $3.45 last year, and topping the median analyst estimate of $3.54.Revenues, reported net of rebates paid to lenders who use MasterCard’s credit and debit networks, were $1.4bn in the third quarter, up 5 per cent from the same period in 2009.The gross dollar volume of card swipes was up 8.5 per cent to $685bn, which included a 15.4 per cent increase in spending across national borders. MasterCard charges an additional fee to users of its networks for cross-border transactions as it takes on currency conversion risks.Volume in the third quarter declined in the US, its largest market, by 1.7 per cent, which was offset by a 23.6 per cent increase in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. Latin America grew by 20 per cent.“Consumers and businesses around the world continue to recognise the benefits of electronic payments and MasterCard remains at the heart of this evolution,” said Ajay Banga, chief executive.MasterCard generates revenues by collecting fees from lenders, such as JPMorganChase and Citigroup, that issue credit and debit cards to consumers that use the MasterCard network.Competition with Visa, Discover and American Express for bank customers has become tougher as a number of large financial institutions consolidated during the height of the financial crisis.MasterCard said that though it raised its prices by about 7 percentage points, that was offset by “a net increase in rebates and incentives due to new and renewed customer agreements”.MasterCard has recently said it wants to compete more directly with non-card payment networks like PayPal, and it acquired DataCash, a UK company, in August.Mr Banga said that in 2011 MasterCard would begin offering a trial of mobile phones-as-credit cards through a large US card issuer. He also said a memorandum of understanding had been signed with China Union Pay to explore mobile payment opportunities.The credit card networks have also been fighting a battle on Capitol Hill, as Democrats led by Senator Richard Durbin inserted an amendment into the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill that would limit how much banks can charge to merchants to use their credit cards.Mr Banga said that he expected the US Federal Reserve, which is empowered by the bill to writing new rules on fees, to release its findings in December.That does not directly affect MasterCard and its rivals, but could lead banks to put pressure on them to lower their own fees.Shares in MasterCard were trading 4.6 per cent higher in the pre-market at $250.00. They are down 6.6 per cent year-to-date.

Economists had forecast a rise to 14 in September.Instead, markets focused on Lennar, the housebuilder, which beat analysts’ expectations when it announced third-quarter results before the opening bell.Wider margins on house sales and increasing revenue at its distressed investing unit lifted earnings per share to 16 cents, above
the average estimate of 6 cents.However, the results included a rise in orders just before the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit and the company said orders fell 15 per cent after the credit was removed. Lennar jumped 8.2 per cent to $15.14.Rival DR Horton also advanced, up 4.2 per cent to $11.05 and the broader S&P 500 homebuilders index gained 5.6 per cent.Elsewhere, deals dominated the market with Netezza jumping 14.9 per cent to $28.27 after IBM agreed to buy the maker of analytics technology and data storage appliances.The deal, worth about $1.7bn or $27 a share in cash, is at a 9.8 per cent premium to Friday’s closing price.Shares in IBM, which has said it plans to spend about $20bn on acquisitions in the next five years, gained 1.2 per cent to $131.79.Teradata, a company that provides similar services to Netezza, advanced 7.5 per cent to $37.04. L-1 Identity Solutions soared 20 per cent to $11.64 after French defence contractor Safran said it will buy the core biometric identity business for $1.1bn. US -listed shares of Safran rose 7.9 per cent to $26.60.In a separate deal, L-1 will sell its government consulting unit to BAE Systems for almost $300m. BAE’s US-listed shares added 1.4 per cent to $20.80.There has been increased interest in biometric technology with industrial conglomerate 3M buying a biometric identity business, Cogent, just last month.Internet Brands, the website operator, surged 44.5 per cent to $13.16 after it agreed to be bought by an affiliate of Hellman & Friedman Capital Partners for about $640m or $13.35 share.In financials, JP Morgan Chase advanced 2.8 per cent to $41.18 and Bank of America rose 2.5 per cent to $13.74.Diamond Hill Investment Group gained 18.9 per cent to $71.75 after the investment management service provider said it would pay a special dividend of $13 a share.Discover Financial climbed 3.8 per cent to $16.16 as consumers spent more on their credit cards, leading to a better-than-expected quarterly profit."
18;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2010-09-17T17:25:37Z;Citi to sell bulk of its student loans unit;;Citigroup will incur a $500m after-tax loss this quarter as part of a deal to sell the bulk of its student loan business to Sallie Mae and Discover Financial Services.Discover will take over the ongoing business of Student Loan Corporation, which was listed in 1992 but remained 80 per cent owned by Citi, and will also purchase $4bn of private student loans.Sallie Mae will acquire $28bn of federally funded student loans prior to the Discover sale, while Citi itself will retain about $8.7bn in assets on its books.In all, SLC shareholders will receive $30 a share, or about $600m. SLC shares on Thursday closed at $21.15.The complex deal highlights Citi’s challenges as it tries to shed $400bn-plus in unwanted assets and businesses accumulated in the past decade.The US government, which holds a stake in Citi of about 17 per cent, regulators and some shareholders have been putting pressure on Citi to accelerate the pace of disposals and get back to its core businesses of international wholesale and retail banking.Citi has countered that a fire-sale of the assets housed in Citi Holdings, its collection of non-core businesses, would increase the chances of incurring losses and end up short-changing taxpayers and other investors.The $500m charge, which will dent Citi’s profits in the third quarter, was mainly the result of accounting writedowns, according to people familiar with the deal. The transaction is, however, expected to add slightly to Citi’s capital.Wall Street analysts expected Citi to record net income of $2.2bn in the three months to September, according to Thomson Reuters.Citi will provide financing for Sallie Mae’s portion of the deal, those people added, the price for which is about $1.2bn.While Sallie Mae paid a premium to the book value of the loans it purchased, Discover on Friday said its deal had been struck at a discount of 8.5 per cent.Citi will pay only slightly under book value for the assets it will keep.Citi Holdings’ assets have declined from more than $820bn at the start of 2008, when Citi decided to create the entity, to $465bn at the end of the second quarter.Vikram Pandit, chief executive, on Friday said Citi Holdings would account for less than 20 per cent of the overall group by the end of the year.Moelis & Company advised the independent directors of SLC. Barclays Capital advised Discover.The US government said it was ending its programme which encouraged private lenders to make government-guaranteed student loans.SLC has previously said it would sell $4.7bn in loans to the US department of education.
19;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2010-06-27T18:21:01Z;Retail banks feel pinch of tougher oversight;;Whether wrangling with a new consumer protection agency or being held to stricter underwriting standards for home loans, retail banks are preparing for broad changes because of the financial reform bill.“To the extent a bank is in the retail consumer business, it gets clobbered the most under this legislation,” said Wayne Abernathy, executive vice-president of financial institutions policies at the American Bankers Association.Mr Abernathy said banks would now be at the mercy of a consumer tsar, appointed by the president and Congress, to run the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Agency.Housed within the Federal Reserve, but independently funded, the agency will have broad powers to regulate all kinds of consumer financial products, from credit cards to home loans.Mr Abernathy called the creation of the agency, “the single most damaging provision in the legislation for retail banks”.Another change involves “ interchange” fees paid by merchants to card issuers. Under the new rules, such fees would be capped by the Federal Reserve at a “reasonable” level.In an important change to the provision, the Fed will be prevented from regulating network fees charged by Visa and MasterCard, leaving the card-issuing banks to bear the brunt of the new fee caps.Frustration over the legislation devolved last week into a rare bit of finger pointing, with David Nelms, the chief executive of Discover Financial Services, blaming price hikes by its rival Visa for setting the stage for more restrictive oversight.“Visa raised prices quite a bit and, I think, took the actions that have led to the legislation in the first place,” Mr Nelms told a reporter. Visa declined to comment.It is not known yet what the final cost to retail banks will be of these new rules, in part because some of them will not be issued for months.Some analysts say that community banks could be pushed into the arms of larger players, which are better equipped to handle the additional oversight.What does seem certain is that banks will look to offset these costs by raising prices elsewhere. Banks have already moved to eliminate free checking and other services in response to restrictions on credit card and overdraft fees enacted earlier this year.The question is whether that cat-and-mouse game will continue under the new regulatory framework.Consumer groups said the legislation was a broad win for Main Street. “Finally consumers have a shot at being part of the market place, instead of trying to stay one step ahead of the latest scam,” said Susan Weinstock, the Consumer Federation of America’s financial reform director.The new consumer watchdog will have help in policing retail banks under new rules that allow state attorneys-general to impose tougher restrictions.National banks will no longer be able to use federal standards to pre-empt local law. State attorneys-general have tended to be quicker than federal regulators to crack down on predatory lending practices.

21;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2010-04-16T01:29:14Z;Credit card delinquencies ease;;Delinquency rates at major US credit card issuers declined in March in yet another sign that the economy is on the mend.Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, American Express, Capital One and Discover Financial Services each reported a slight decline in the percentage of card payments that were at least 30 days late, a leading indicator of consumers’ financial health.The results echo comments made on Wednesday by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive, and Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, about how the economy is showing signs of a rebound.“There are strong indications that not only the economy but the financial condition of individual households is starting to improve,” said Stephen Brobeck, the executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, a lobbying group. “Consumers are increasing their spending and yet at the same time reducing loan delinquencies.”Loan delinquencies tend to dip slightly in the spring as consumers use tax refunds to repay debt. But a strengthening economy is also giving people more confidence to spend. The government reported this week that retail sales in March jumped 1.6 per cent, more than analysts had expected and the largest monthly increase since November. Analysts warned that any recovery was still nascent and deeper problems persisted in the economy, including high unemployment and a weak housing market.Although the future is starting to look brighter for credit card issuers as delinquency rates fall, they are still grappling with record high losses on uncollectable loans. Bank of America and Discover both reported a decline in charge-offs but other issuers saw the measure climb month over month.At Bank of America, charge-offs fell to 12.54 per cent in March from 13.51 per cent in February. Delinquency rates dipped to 7.07 per cent from 7.23 per cent a month earlier. Discover said charge-offs dropped to 8.51 per cent in March from 9.11 per cent in February, and that delinquencies edged down to 5.39 per cent from 5.50 per cent.JPMorgan saw delinquencies drop to 4.51 per cent in March from 4.67 per cent in February but charge-offs rose to 9.51 per cent from 9.21 per cent in the same period. At Capital One, delinquencies fell to 5.30 per cent from 5.51 per cent and charge-offs rose to 10.87 per cent from 10.19 per cent.American Express also saw delinquencies fall, which bodes well for future business.

Excluding food and energy, prices rose by 0.1 per cent, as expected.“Even if we see some heat in [US producer prices], the question is whether it can carry through to the core CPI [consumer price index], which would be a problem. That’s not likely soon,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Schwab.She added: “We are not in an inflationary environment.”After the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.58 per cent at 1,166.21, an 18-month high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.5 per cent to 10,733.67, rallying for the seventh consecutive day.

ExxonMobil gained 1.2 per cent to $67.36, while Chevron was up 0.9 per cent to $74.67.Massey Energy led the sector higher, gaining 5.8 per cent to $53.15, after the coal producer said it is to acquire Cumberland Resources for $960m and would consider raising new equity capital to help finance the acquisition. Massey also warned it expects its first-quarter earnings to be below analyst estimates.AMR Corp, the parent company of American Airlines, fell 0.7 per cent to $9.59, as its flight attendants requested federal approval to end contract talks, thought to be the first step towards a strike at a leading US carrier in almost five years.The airline sector was broadly down.Continental Airlines lost 2.7 per cent to $22.57, UAL Corp, the parent of United Airlines, declined 3.4 per cent to $19.49 and US Airways was 2.3 per cent down to $7.59.
23;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2010-02-16T20:33:25Z;Credit card charge-off rates slow;;"Bank of America, Capital One and Discover reported better-than-expected charge-off and delinquency rates in January, fuelling hope that the worst of the credit bust may soon be behind the lenders.Bank of America said current charge-offs and loans at least 30 days overdue fell slightly in January. Discover and Capital One both reported increases – but the rise was less than some analysts had expected.“It [seems] delinquencies are stabilising,” said Bruce Harting, Barclays Capital analyst. He expects charge-offs and delinquencies to peak this quarter.Credit card issuers are also benefiting from an unusual phenomenon by which home owners, many of whom owe more on their mortgages than their properties are worth, are choosing to default on home loans to pay credit cards instead. It was formerly the other way round. According to credit bureau Trans-
Union 6.6 per cent of consumers were current on their credit cards but delinquent on mortgages in the third quarter of 2009, up from 4.3 per cent in 2008.US consumers are still cutting their credit use unprecedentedly. Outstanding credit card debt is about $855bn, down from $980bn in 2008. Analysts see it falling another $80bn this year.“Things are stabilising, [but] not improving materially,” said Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Even a sliver of good news was enough to boost shares of card issuers. At midday, Bank of America, Capital One and Discover were trading higher. Bank of America said loans at least 30 days past due fell to 7.35 per cent in January from 7.44 per cent in December. Uncollectible debt – known as charge-offs – declined to 13.25 per cent from 13.53 per cent the previous month.Capital One said 30-day delinquencies rose to 5.8 per cent from 5.78 per cent. Write-offs of uncollectible debt were up to 10.41 per cent from 10.14 per cent. Discover’s delinquency rate climbed to 5.55 per cent from 5.49 per cent. Write-offs dipped to 8.58 per cent from 8.68 per cent.It is unclear how much of the increase was seasonal. Charge-offs tend to rise early in the year as people struggle to pay down debt amassed during the holiday season. Bankruptcy rates increase as spring nears. Analysts said the worst of the bad-debt problem was probably behind the card companies."

Discover declined to appeal against the decision. Their agreement also ends counterclaims the company had made against Morgan Stanley, Discover said in a US regulatory filing. “We are delighted with the outcome,” a Morgan Stanley official said.Morgan Stanley spun off Discover in 2007 to sharpen its focus on investment banking, trading, asset management and retail brokerage businesses. As part of its spin-off deal, the bank had maintained a claim on as much as $1.5bn in pre-tax proceeds that the credit card business might collect from its then-unresolved antitrust case against Visa and MasterCard.Morgan Stanley had sued the card operators for preventing banks from issuing Discover cards after officials at the US Department of Justice had alleged their actions had violated antitrust regulations. Both Visa and MasterCard settled with Illinois-based Discover in 2008. Discover then refused to pay Morgan Stanley, arguing that its former parent had interfered with the antitrust settlement discussions.A former finance arm of the US retailing group Sears Roebuck, Discover had been hatched by Phil Purcell, who later ran Morgan Stanley. Sears folded the business into Dean Witter, a brokerage, and spun off the combined company to shareholders in 1993.Mr Purcell, then chief executive of Dean Witter Discover, merged his company with Morgan Stanley in 1997. Shortly before being ousted as Morgan CEO, Mr Purcell had unveiled plans to spin off Discover. His successor, John Mack, reversed them, then reconsidered.Morgan Stanley’s shares fell 0.04 per cent to close at $27.16 on Friday. Discover fell 0.01 per cent to $13.03.

Merrill Lynch raised American Express, Capital One Financial and Discover Financial Services from “underperform” to “neutral”. BofA-Merrill said economic recovery should improve credit trends and increase consumer demand. American Express rose 0.3 per cent to $39.41.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Citigroup lost 0.7 per cent to $4.03 after it emerged that the bank was locked in talks with the government over how much money it needs to raise to exit the troubled asset relief program.Last week, Bank of America sold $19.3bn in securities as part of a plan to repay $45bn of federal funds.Separately, Kuwait’s sovereign wealth fund, the Kuwait Investment Authority, sold its stake in Citigroup for $4.1bn, making about $1.1bn in profit.New York Community Bancorp jumped 8.7 per cent to $13.40 after the company said it would offer 60m shares to boost its capital levels following its purchase of certain assets and deposits of AmTrust Bank.On Friday, the group bought an $11bn chunk of AmTrust in a deal assisted by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.McDermott International added to the market’s gains after announcing plans to split into two publicly listed companies, separating its power generation business from its offshore oil and gas operations.Following the deal, expected to be completed in under a year, the group’s shareholders will own 100 per cent of the two different companies. The group’s shares jumped 10.7 per cent to $22.86.In the pharmaceutical sector, Eli Lilly won approval from US regulators to extend the use of Zyprexa, its anti-psychotic medicine, to teenagers with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The drugmaker’s shares were down 0.9 per cent to $37.07 after early gains.Amgen, one of the world’s largest biotechnology companies, lost 0.7 per cent to $56.48 after it said it would increase its share buy-back programme by $5bn. The group’s shares have fallen this year after safety concerns over its anaemia drugs led to sales declines.Sunpower, the country’s second-largest supplier of solar cells, climbed 9.6 per cent to $24.45 after Barclays Capital raised the group from “equal-weight/neutral” to “overweight/neutral”.Its shares plunged last month after the group said it was investigating millions of dollars in accounting errors at its Philippines operations.Terra Industries, the fertiliser producer, rose 5.7 per cent to $41.27 after CF Industries Holdings lifted its offer to buy its smaller rival to about $4.6bn. CF gained 1.1 per cent to $89.56."

General Electric climbed 4.2 per cent to $16, while Alcoa rose 8.1 per cent to $13.99. Rising commodity prices have helped power Wall Street’s rally over the past two weeks.The S&P closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,052.63. The Nasdaq rose 0.5 per cent to 2,102.64, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent at 9,683.41.Retail sales had initially given investors confidence. In August, sales rose by the most in more than three years, boosted by the cash-for-clunkers car buying programme and signs of extra spending by consumers.In other data, the New York Federal Reserve Bank said that its “Empire State” manufacturing activity index rose in September to 18.88 from 12.08 in August.Technology stocks also pushed the market higher from the opening bell. Ebay was up 1.3 per cent at $24.14 after Piper Jaffray upgraded the shares of the online auctioneer. Also on the upgrade list was Yahoo, which was raised to “outperform” from “market perform” by Sanford C. Bernstein. The stock was up 5.4 per cent at $16.41.But consumer stocks dragged the indices into the red for brief periods during the day and continued to limit gains.Kroger, the supermarket chain, was one of the worst casualties in the consumer sector. The shares fell 7.5 per cent to $20.46 after the group posted second-quarter profit below estimates and reduced its full-year outlook. The company, which also operates Ralphs and Food 4 Less stores, has come under pressure to slash its prices in the recession to compete with low-price competitors such as Wal-Mart.Shares of rival Safeway also fell 3.6 per cent to $19.48 after the results
from Kroger, while Supervalu slipped 3.6 per cent to $15.73.Best Buy, the consumer electronics chain, also hit confidence in the sector after the retailer said second-quarter profit fell 22 per cent to $158m. The shares fell 5.2 per cent to $38.32.Johnson & Johnson said it would reduce by $115m to $885m the amount it would pay for an 18.4 per cent stake in Elan. The revised terms of the deal are designed to appease a dispute between Elan and Biogen, its US partner. Shares in Johnson & Johnson were down 0.3 per cent at $60.15.Financial stocks also led the market lower initially. It emerged that Citigroup was exploring options to facilitate a sale of the government’s 34 per cent stake in the troubled financial giant. Citi fell 8.9 per cent to $4.12. Shares in Citi closed at $4.52 on Monday, up from a low of $2.31 in March.The US authorities received more than 7bn shares in the troubled financial group at $3.25 each, after converting $25bn of preferred stock into common equity at the end of July. The share exchange boosted Citi’s ratio of tangible common equity to assets, providing it with a greater buffer of loss-absorbing capital.Bank of America lost 1.2 per cent to $16.79 and JPMorgan slipped 1.3 per cent to $43.19. After reporting increases in credit-card write-offs, Discover Financial Services fell in early trading but closed up 0.8 per cent to $15.14.Healthcare stocks took another battering as President Barack Obama reiterated his plans to curb medical expenses through sector reform. UnitedHealth fell 3.7 per cent to $27.70 and WellPoint dropped 1.8 per cent to $53.16.Kraft also came back into focus after its recent take-over bid for Cadbury. The shares slipped 0.1 per cent following early gains after the company announced plans to hold talks with the British chocolate maker. It also said it did not need to sell any of its other operations or brands in order to afford its $16bn bid."
27;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2009-07-26T17:30:27Z;How the cards are cut;;Mick Longfellow is teetering on the edge of financial chaos. A dedicated teacher married to an equally hard-working nurse, living in a modest house in Newcastle in the north-east of England, the pair spent the past decade treating themselves to gadgets, gizmos and home upgrades.They put in new windows. They bought the biggest television and sound system their living room could accommodate. They changed their cars every year or two. With two children to spoil as well, they were living on credit – lots of it. There were store cards, car loans, personal loans and credit cards.Now, amid the recession, those lenders want their money back. “The bank just closed down our overdraft. That was the killer blow,” says Mr Longfellow. But with the family’s debts running to £30,000 ($49,200, €34,600), far more than their annual disposable income, repayment is going to take a very long time.It is a sad blow for the Longfellows. But multiply one family’s debts by the millions of people across the world who are in an even worse state, losing jobs and homes, and the scale of the problem is clear. Estimates from the International Monetary Fund say that of US consumer debt totalling $1,914bn (£1,166bn, €1,346bn), 14 per cent will turn bad. For Europe, it expects 7 per cent of the $2,467bn of consumer debt will be lost, with much of that falling in the UK, the continent’s biggest nation of borrowers.In the US, the carnage is well under way. For nearly two years, banks ranging from giants such as Citigroup to small community lenders have been bleeding as the economic downturn caused “maxed out” consumers to fall behind on their repayments of credit cards, automotive loans, student loans and other once-plentiful forms of credit.In recent months, what started as a debacle has turned into a nightmare. As unemployment continued to rise and house prices kept falling, the rate of defaults has surpassed historic norms, rendering many of the computer models used by US banks to predict losses useless. In this phase of the crisis, lenders are flying blind.“We are asking boards of financial institutions to sit down, think about plausible nightmare scenarios and then take measures to deal with them,” says Peter Niculescu, a former executive at Fannie Mae, the US mortgage institution, who is now a partner at Capital Market Risk Advisors, a financial consultancy.America’s story makes a frightening read for banks on the other side of the Atlantic. The question now is what happens next in Europe, particularly in the UK, the continent’s biggest consumer lending market, where concrete signs of mass stress have so far been less obvious.“In the UK, particularly, we haven’t seen a lot of discussion about [consumer debt default],” says Nathan Powell, head of financial sector research at RiskMetrics, a credit data group. “There has been a focus on banks’ capital, liquidity and their mortgage exposure.”With much of the world in recession, the banking industry has been girding itself for some time against the threat – in recessions banks expect to make losses on loans. But some experts worry whether banks active in Europe, many of which have been rejuvenated by a quick bounce-back in their investment banking operations in the first half of the year, are yet taking sufficient account of the damage that their consumer loan books could yet wreak on profits.“Proponents of a V-shaped [economic] recovery are underestimating how much rising unemployment and an unstable structure of indebtedness can lengthen and deepen this recession,” says Sandy Chen, banks analyst at Panmure Gordon in London.Historic norms suggest that unsecured consumer loans default at a rate of less than 5 per cent in periods of recession. Although for credit cards the rate is higher, at 7 to 9 per cent, companies charge heftier interest rates to offset the increased risk of default.But this is no ordinary recession – and no one can agree how bad it is going to get. Some economists argue that the worst may already be over but many believe in a “double-dip” downturn, with another fall-off in demand likely to come later this year. Whether or not that happens, the effects of the first dip are still filtering through to the real world.Unemployment is still rising – and fast – on both sides of the Atlantic. More than 9 per cent of working-age Americans are now without work, nearly double the year-ago figure, and the UK unemployment tally is at 7.6 per cent. There are widespread expectations that both numbers could soon exceed 10 per cent – and joblessness, unsurprisingly, is the biggest driver of consumer loan default.The real unknown, however, is to what extent a recession already on a par with the 1930s will be turned into something even worse by record levels of consumer debt. British consumers’ leverage – how much they owe as a proportion of income – has been rising fast for a decade and for the past nine months has been running at a record high of more than 170 per cent – far bigger than anywhere else in Europe.In the US, the percentages have been rising too, and are hovering around the 140 per cent mark. In the last recession, of the early 1990s, UK leverage was barely more than 100 per cent and in the US it was less than 90 per cent. “The severity of this crisis has taken everyone by surprise,” says Mr Powell at RiskMetrics. “Delinquencies and charge-offs [the percentage of outstanding loans that is unlikely to be recouped] are deteriorating at a faster rate than anyone expected a year ago.”…Industry executives in Europe are beginning to sound like their US counterparts in raising the alarm about spiralling losses on unsecured consumer debt as one of their biggest areas of concern.“We think the market in general is far too optimistic about the outlook for unsecured consumer debt defaults,” says Antonio Horta-Osorio, chief executive of Abbey, the UK business of Spain’s Santander. “We have been actively reducing our exposure to consumer lending, so that it is now half the size it was three years ago.”The US experience is showing the way. “It started in subprime mortgages, then it moved to prime mortgages, then to car financing,” says Mark Greene, chief executive of Fico, the US credit checking group. “Now it’s moving to credit cards.”Over the past 18 months, US banks and card issuers have been coping with the fallout of millions of overleveraged consumers defaulting on an increasing portion of their unsecured debt. Loss rates on credit cards have almost tripled since January 2007 as soaring unemployment, housing woes and the stock market’s troubles prompted an ever-increasing number of borrowers to stop paying their balances.Perhaps more worryingly, the long-held relationship between credit card loss rates and unemployment is breaking down. Credit card loss rates have in the past closely tracked unemployment, topping the jobless rate on just a handful of occasions, and only once by any significant margin. That was in 2005 as a flood of borrowers entered bankruptcy and wrote off their credit card debt before the passage of a law that made it harder to file for bankruptcy.But in this recession, job redundancies have been compounded by other sources of distress to push credit card losses higher. Losses on US credit cards as measured by Moody’s credit card index were at a record of close to 10.8 per cent in June, ahead of the nation’s 9.5 per cent unemployment rate.As the recession has deepened, meanwhile, bankruptcy filings are once more approaching 2005 levels, fuelling the credit card meltdown.For some banks, losses on credit cards have been severe for months. Credit card loans originated by Washington Mutual, the troubled bank bought by JPMorgan Chase last September, are defaulting at a staggering rate of 24 per cent. Bank of America’s June charge-offs were close to 14 per cent and delinquencies – loans that have not been paid – were 1.9 per cent, exceeding the totals for Citigroup, JPMorgan, American Express, Capital One and Discover.If average charge-off rates reach 18 to 20 per cent, credit card losses for US issuers could exceed $82bn, the Federal Reserve said in May after stress tests on 19 large lenders.Such losses are proving to be a problem even in cases where the banks thought they had offlaid the risk. Banks such as Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have had to come to the rescue of the off-balance-sheet vehicles that help them to fund credit card loans, as these vehicles have been weakened by consumer defaults. In Britain, banks argue that they have been more prudent than peers elsewhere, owing to the scare of mass defaults four years ago after the law was changed to make personal bankruptcy via Individual Voluntary Arrangements far easier. That prompted the biggest lenders – Barclays, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS (now part of Lloyds) and HSBC – to toughen their criteria for lending: they lent less, and only to people with decent credit records.But what the banks do not point out is how many of them then let their standards slip at a crucial time. Just ahead of the financial crisis, in 2007, the big five banks (now the big four) started an aggressive expansion of their lending. Barclays is typical – after tempering its consumer lending in 2006, for example, it expanded it from less than £38bn to more than £53bn over the next two years. That kind of expansion at Lloyds and RBS has compounded those groups’ balance sheet woes.When the UK banks start reporting their six-monthly results early next month, they will give some idea of how bad those bad debts are turning out to be. They are already planning for default rates at the top end of historic levels.…One of the best insights into the likely patterns in consumer debt defaults comes from the niche world of credit card securitisations – where the performance data of a second-hand package of a bank’s credit card “receivables”, or credit repayments, are published monthly.The so-called Master Trusts of US credit card debt show default rates running at 9 to 18 per cent, up by 50 to 100 per cent over the past year, with most of the rise coming since the start of 2009. With UK trends tending to trail the US by six months, analysts are now watching closely for signs that British securitisations, with default rates running at a relatively stable 7 to 14 per cent, start rising.The focus on the securitisation data is a stark reminder, too, that it if this highly leveraged recession does lead to record levels of credit defaults, it will not just be the banks that suffer. Analysts estimate that in the UK close to one-third – and in the US about two-thirds – of consumer debt has historically been securitised. If those packages of debt turn bad – or even worse than they had already been reckoned to be – that would hit the investors that are holding them hard.Some of those investors will be investment banks – compounding the impact of the core lending losses to which their commercial banking rivals (or sister operations) are already exposed.In other cases, the pain will be even more broadly felt, says Huw van Steenis, analyst at Morgan Stanley. “I think the bigger holders now of securitisations are insurance companies and pension funds.” For families such as the Longfellows, with retirement looming in the next decade, that threatens to be the real sting in the tail.

Its shares picked up 4.2 per cent to $17.26.Other chipmakers also felt the benefit with AMD, Intel’s main rival, gaining 8.7 per cent to $3.86.Intel’s strong sales also provided optimism over personal computer sales and PC makers rose accordingly. Hewlett-Packard gained 4.5 per cent to $38.82.The rally gathered pace during the day and an upward revision in theFederal Reserve’s unemployment forecasts failed to knock it off course, as investors took confidence in a simultaneuos upgrade in the growth predictions.“The Intel numbers are enough to fuel the rally in the short term, but eventually the US unemployment rate is going to have an effect on the rest of the world,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 3 per cent up at 932.68, while the Dow rose 3.1 per cent to 8,616.21 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gained 3.5 per cent to 1,862.90.Anu Sharma, managing director of Nasdaq’s Market Intelligence Desk, described trading as a “short squeeze”, with short sellers having to buy back stocks in the worry that they might suffer heavy losses if the market rises further.There was also a warning sign on the stability of the current rally from the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility that usually drops when the market rises. It gained 3.4 per cent to 25.87 on Wednesday, suggesting investors were betting on an imminent drop.Materials stocks were also higher as the prices of metals picked up. Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper and gold, rose 5.7 per cent to $50.91. Its rival Newmont Mining gained 3.4 per cent to $40.45.Energy stocks were higher as the price of oil jumped. Chevron rose 2.5 per cent to $64.57 and Schlumberger climbed 5.3 per cent to $54.56. Investors also bought financial stocks, with banking shares continuing to bask in the afterglow of bumper profits from Goldman Sachs.But it was credit card companies that stood out after Capital One and Discover Financial both said loan losses in June had not been as bad as expected, in spite of the rising unemployment rate. Capital One jumped 11.8 per cent to $25.84 and Discover gained 6.2 per cent to $10.85.Shares in industrial companies also took part in the rally, helped by data showing industrial production had shrunk less than expected and factory output in the New York region had dropped by the smallest amount in over a year.General Electric rose 5.2 per cent to $12.24 and Caterpillar, which manufactures equipment for the industrial sector, put on 6 per cent to $33.84.The airline sector was boosted by AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, which reported a smaller-than-expected loss, which lifted the shares 4.3 per cent to $4.36.The general market optimism was tempered, however, by disappointing profits from Abbott Labs, one of the largest US drugmakers. The company also forecast full-year profits at the lower end of analysts’ expectations and the shares fell 2.6 per cent to $45.28.There were also worrying signs on consumer spending from Yum Brands, which operates the Pizza Hut and KFC fast-food franchises.It reported better earnings than expected but warned the rise in its same-store sales this year would disappoint. The stock lost 5.5 per cent to $34.05.Results from Gannett, which publishes USA Today, were more encouraging. It saw better-than-expected profit, powered by its online businesses. The shares soared 28.9 per cent to $4.50.

The shares gained 1.6 per cent to $9.41.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down 2 per cent at 881.03, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.9 per cent to 8,163.60 and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 2.3 per cent to 1,746.17.That came after sharp selling in the afternoon as the S&P fell below its 200-day moving average, which is seen as a key support level.“The ten-year Treasury bond has taken off and the dollar is strengthening, which is bad news for stocks,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams. “We got way too positive too soon.”Analysts predicted that the market would remain subdued at least until Thursday, after Alcoa has reported its results.“Everyone is taking a deep breath before earnings,” said Andy Corn, chief investment officer, equities, at Beacon Trust.The pressure from energy and materials stocks was counteracted by strength from health insurers after president Obama and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel stressed that a public health insurance plan would help keep the private sector competitive.Health insurers, which have suffered on concerns about the effects of the president’s reforms, bounced on Tuesday.UnitedHealth gained 4.5 per cent to $25.17 and Aetna rose 6.3 per cent to $25.94.“It shows how sensitive those stocks are that some words from the White House last night have given those stocks a pop,” said
Mr Corn.Certain microchip manufacturers performed well after Bank of America raised its ratings for several companies in the sector.The bank said it saw a “definitive turn in end demand” and recommended that investors buy stocks in Intel, the market leader.But Intel lost its early gains amid a wider sell-off in the technology sector and finished 1.8 per cent down at $16.25.BofA also upgraded Marvell Technology, which gained 0.9 per cent to $11.50 and LSI, which climbed
2.2 per cent to $4.65.Banking stocks were mixed as banks continued to raise capital to bolster their balance sheets.KeyCorp was one of the sector’s strongest stocks after KBW upgraded the shares, saying the bank’s balance sheet was stronger than the Treasury required after it raised fresh capital. Keycorp’s shares climbed 4.1 per cent to $5.29.But shares in Discover Financial, the credit card group, dropped 10.8 per cent to $9.37 after the company announced it would issue $500m of stock.Discover, which only made a profit last quarter after successful litigation against rivals Visa and MasterCard, forecast a default rate of up to 9 per cent in the third quarter.Goldman Sachs gave an initial boost to Kohl’s after it upgraded the shares, saying it is the best positioned department store to show positive same-store sales in the fourth quarter. But Kohl’s could not resist the selling and its stock closed 0.9 per cent down at $42.30.Goldman downgraded BJs Wholesale Club, however, the warehouse club that has prospered as shoppers look for bargains.The bank said consumers would soon begin returning to more discretionary retailers, and BJ’s shares fell 2 per cent to $31.46."

Fears over global demand knocked oil prices, which continued to fall from their highs.Shares in energy companies followed oil lower, with ConocoPhillipsfalling 5.9 per cent to $40.43 and Schlumberger giving up 5.5 per cent to $52.32.Copper prices also suffered after estimated Chinese copper consumption dropped 3.5 per cent for May compared to April, leading to concerns that the country might soon stop restocking the metal.Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper, lost 11.3 per cent to $45.18. Prices of other metals also fell, bringing down shares in the companies that produce them. AK Steel gave up 13 per cent to $16.50 while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, fell
8.9 per cent to $10.02.The general economic worries were exacerbated by a report from the World Bank that warned the global recession would be deeper than it had predicted in March, with the world economy suffering a 2.9 per cent decline in 2009.“The figure is surprisingly downbeat given the fact that it is even lower than what the International Monetary Fund is expecting,” said Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics.Karl Mills, president of Jurika, Mills & Keifer, agreed, saying: “The economy is still sicker than people realise.”The S&P closed down 3.1 per cent at 893.04, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4 per cent to 8,339.01 points and the Nasdaq Composite index declined 3.4 per cent to 1,766.19 points.Investors bet that volatility would return to the markets after several weeks of trading within a narrow range.The Vix index, a measure of implied volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge spiked 11.4 per cent to 31.19.US investors were also nervous about the pace of the domestic recovery after Walgreen, the fast growing chain of chemists and general retailers, reported lower profits than Wall Street expected, despite rising sales. The shares fell 5.7 per cent to $29.64.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said that recent signs on corporate earnings were not promising. “The profit outlook is becoming less certain given the recent trend in earnings reports and a more mixed economic outlook,” he wrote.Delta Air Lines dropped 6.9 per cent to $5.65 after Richard Anderson, the chief executive, said the company has absorbed a $250m hit to second-quarter revenue as a result of swine flu, and had been forced to cut capacity as a result.Shares in Apple fluctuated as optimism over sales of the new model of its iPhone competed with concerns over the health of Steve Jobs, its talismanic chief executive.The stock slipped in pre-market trade after reports at the weekend that Mr Jobs had undergone a liver transplant two months ago.But the shares rose after the company said it had sold more than 1m units of the new iPhone, compared to forecasts of closer to 500,000.The stock opened higher, but then dropped as the market extended its losses. It closed 1.5 per cent lower at $137.37.Bank of America lost 9.7 per cent to $11.94 after two more board members joined the list of departures from the company, bringing the total to seven since April.Its rival Citigroup dropped 5.4 per cent to $3, with analysts at Fox-Pitt saying that the bank’s planned conversion of preferred shares into common equity would put “significant pressure” on the stock.Credit card company Discover Financial Services avoided the worst of the selling in the financial sector following its announcement of a surprise quarterly profit last week.The figures caused analysts at RBC Capital Markets to raise their price target on the company on Monday, and the shares fell a modest 0.1 per cent to $9.31."
31;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2009-06-18T20:31:58Z;Wall Street rises as recession fears subside;;US stocks made gains on Thursday following three successive sessions of losses as fresh data indicated the recession was closer to ending than expected.Data on jobless claims, manufacturing in the Philadelphia region and leading economic indicators all helped spark a modest rally despite early concerns over the effect of new proposals on financial regulation.Futures spent most of the pre-market session flat as investors waited to see how Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, would be received when he addressed Congress on the new rules.They then received a boost on the release of figures showing that the number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits unexpectedly fell two weeks ago for the first time since January 3.The markets fell into negative territory soon after the market opened, though, as investors sold stock in General Electric, one of the companies likely to be classed as “systemically important” and so subject to much stricter oversight under the proposed legislation.The oversight would affect even GE’s non-financial businesses, leading to speculation it might spin off its financial arm rather than face the burden of heavy regulation. The shares fell 1.5 per cent to $11.97.But stocks in other sectors responded more positively to the plans, which analysts said could moderate the risk faced by many investors.“Reducing the risk investors face is a way of keeping Wall Street as a major financial competitive advantage for the US,” said David Darst, chief investment strategist for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.Financial stocks performed especially well, with Bank of America gaining 4.9 per cent to $12.90 and JPMorgan picking up 4.4 per cent to $34.17.The sector was also boosted by data showing that leading economic indicators are improving faster than expected and that the deceleration in Philadelphia’s manufacturing industry had slowed dramatically. This helped financial stocks lift markets out of negative territory during the morning. “The markets are particularly sensitive to economic reports right now as people decide whether to send them higher or lower,” said Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.8 per cent up at 918.37 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 8,555.60. The Nasdaq Composite index slipped a fraction to 1,807.72, however.The travel sector was under the microscope as investors reacted to results from cruise line operator Carnival and bearish words from two global airlines.UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, said traffic in the second quarter was expected to fall as much as 10.5 per cent compared with a year ago. That knocked the shares 4 per cent down to $3.82.The negativity surrounding the sector was reinforced by Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, who said the airline industry was yet to feel the worst of the downturn.Other carriers also fell. AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, lost 4.4 per cent to $4.38 and Delta Air Lines dropped 3.2 per cent to $5.98.Shares in Carnival rose after the company said that lower costs helped its profits beat Wall Street’s estimates.The company has suffered a bruising early summer on fears that swine flu would stop people travelling, but managed to outstrip the market’s expectations, sending the shares up 7.5 per cent to $24.77.Meanwhile, JM Smucker, which makes jam, showed rare growth in the consumer sector after reporting rising profits. Sales rose, helped by its purchase of the Folgers coffee business, and the shares climbed 9.7 per cent to $47.86.In the financial sector, Discover Financial Services made a surprise profit for the quarter after a successful antitrust lawsuit against Visa and Mastercard helped cushion rising loan losses. The shares gained 4 per cent to $9.27.Sallie Mae, the student loan provider, rose 5.5 per cent to $8.11 on news that it was one of the companies to which the Department of Education awarded a contract to service its $550m loan portfolio.

The proposals are similar to sweeping rules adopted by US federal regulators in December. These rules take effect in July 2010, but the bill’s approval would accelerate their implementation, forcing the country’s banking industry to forgo billions of dollars of annual interest payments sooner.The regulator’s rules impose strict new disclosure standards on credit card lenders and prohibit pricing practices that have been criticised for exposing borrowers to unforeseen costs.The pro-consumer bill is an important test of the political will of Democrats who are pushing for US financial regulation reform.During his presidential campaign, Mr Obama made an issue of excessive credit card fees but he has since been largely silent on the matter. As a candidate, he also favoured legislation to make it easier for troubled homeowners to use bankruptcy courts to ease the terms of their mortgages.
33;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2009-04-16T03:13:10Z;Wall Street set to open lower;;US stocks were mixed on Wednesday morning as lower than expected inflation figures and good news from Procter & Gamble balanced fears about demand in the technology sector.Procter & Gamble gave consumer companies a much needed boost amid falling retail sales numbers and and negative words on the economy from Mike Duke, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, after the company raised its dividend for the 52nd straight year. It lifted its quarterly shareholder payout 10 per cent to $0.44, and its shares picked up 2.5 per cent to $48.44.This helped the consumer staples sector perform better than any other on the benchmark S&P 500 index, despite Mr Duke saying there would be no quick end to the recession.But Intel fuelled concerns about consumer demand in the technology sector after it refused to give formal guidance for its second quarter earnings despite reporting better results than expected.The company said it had made $0.11 of net profit per share, compared to expectations of just $0.03. But visibility remained low, and the company would only say that for internal purposes, it expected revenues for the second quarter to be roughly in line with those seen during the first three months of the year.The shares fell on the lack of clarity, losing 4.7 per cent to $15.26. Rival chip maker National Semiconductor also fell, dropping ?3 per cent to $11.88, while Microsoft gave up 2.8 per cent to $18.81.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned the market could have priced in better earnings than analyst had predicted, which could mean equity falls even after strong results. “Intel provided good results compared to printed expectations, but the market reacted poorly to margin guidance. The aftermarket selling may hint that the trade is too long into earnings,” he wrote.CPI numbers showed inflation was lower than expected, with prices for March falling 0.1 per cent, and gaining 0.2 per cent excluding food and energy. But this failed to spark a rally in equities, with investors more concerned about the lack of demand for US goods and services.Concern over future revenues for technology companies led the Nasdaq lower, falling 0.6 per cent to 1,615.51 points. But the S&P rose 0.1 per cent to 842.52 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 7,942.56 points.Mortgage applications fell for the week ending April 10 for the first time in over a month, putting some pressure on financial stocks, which have fallen recently as data have shaken confidence that the country will soon see the beginnings of an economic recovery.Citigroup, which was one of the few banks to find gains on Tuesday, fell back 4.5 per cent to $3.83 in early trade, while Bank of America lost 5.5 per cent to $9.53.Credit card companies added to the gloom in financial stocks after Capital One said that customer defaults rose in March along with the unemployment rate. Capital One lost 4.2 per cent to $16.36, while Discover gave up 2.8 per cent to $8.45 and Mastercard retreated 2.9 per cent to $161.30.As earnings season began to hit full speed, there was negative news from the bigger companies reporting their first quarter results.Peabody Energy disappointed the market despite reporting increased sales and revenue by making only $0.50 per share in earnings compared to consensus estimates of $0.95. The company also deferred providing full-year targets, with future demand still unclear. Its shares fell 11.7 per cent to $25.92.Abbott Laboratories also fell despite reporting increased profits. The company made $0.73 per share in earnings compared to estimates of $0.70, but this was fuelled by one-off gains, and with global sales declining, including those of its top-selling drug Humira, its shares lost 3.7 per cent to $43.04.General Motors continued to pick up ground, however, after Bloomberg reported encouraging signs of agreement between bondholders and the United Auto Workers union over retiree healthcare plans as the company seeks to restructure. Its shares gained 5.6 per cent to $1.88.Allegheny Energy was the biggest riser on the S&P, after Barclays raised the utility company to “overweight” from “equal weight”, saying the company may benefit from an auction for Pennsylvania power prices. The company’s shares picked up 6.6 per cent to $25.97.European stocks were down early on Wall Street, driven lower by poor results from Swiss bank UBS. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was 0.4 per cent lower at 786.71 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly down, with the FTSE Asia-Pacific index giving up 0.4 per cent to 168.08 points.Bond yields were little changed, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note gaining 2 basis point to 0.867 per cent and that on the 10-year Treasury note unchanged at 2.783 per cent.The dollar was higher against major currencies early in New York, rising 0.1 per cent against the euro to $1.3250, and 0.2 per cent on the yen to Y99.03.Gold was trading $0.42 higher at $891.09 per troy ounce.Oil prices were also up, and back abovfe the $50 mark. US crude prices were $0.65 higher at $50.06 a barrel.
34;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2009-04-14T20:59:38Z;US stocks fall despite Goldman results;;"US stocks fell on Tuesday as much better than expected results from Goldman Sachs were offset by negative economic data.Financials were the biggest fallers even though Goldman helped return some confidence to the sector by far outstripping analysts’ estimates with its first-quarter earnings.Goldman announced it had made $3.39 a share against expectations of just $1.49 a share on the back of strong trading figures.But the bank’s shares fell as it also announced it was to raise $5bn of capital by issuing new shares in order to repay money from the Troubled Asset Relief Programme (Tarp).This would dilute existing shareholdings, and its shares dropped 11.6 per cent to $115.11. Rival Morgan Stanley, which is forecast to make a loss when it reports, fell 12 per cent to $23.67.“It’s no surprise that Goldman was profitable, when they can borrow at zero per cent from the Federal Reserve. The real question is whether it has to make
writedowns later in the year,” said Andrew Mulligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments.However, the positive underlying results did help boost Citigroup, the most beaten-up of all the major banking stocks. Citi leapt 25 per cent during Monday’s session and added 5.5 per cent on Tuesday to $4.01.Financial shares in general were badly hit by figures which showed retail sales unexpectedly fell during March, losing 0.9 per cent, excluding sales of automobiles.Meanwhile, the falling oil price helped drive down ­producer prices in March, contrary to analysts’ ­expectations, following two successive months of gains.Discover dropped after it said that it would cut more than 4 per cent of its workforce as it strives to cut costs. The credit card lender also suffered from a downgrade to “hold” by Stifel Nicolaus, and its shares had lost 10.4 per cent to $7.57.MetLife, the life insurer, also fell, despite saying it would not take federal bail-out funds, even though it is entitled to by the fact that it purchased a bank in 2001.Robert Henrikson, its chief executive, said MetLife was “well positioned, with approximately $5bn in excess capital”. But its shares became caught in the broad sell-off, falling 8.2 per cent to $26.44.Retailers also suffered. after the data. Home Depot lost 2.4 per cent to $25.34, while Macy’s dropped 7.3 per cent to $11.99 and Best Buy fell 6.9 per cent to $38.10.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2 per cent down at 841.51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7 per cent to 7,920.18 points and the Nasdaq Composite index had dropped 1.7 per cent to 1,625.72 points.“Analysts are being too optimistic with their predictions on what really matters, such as how much people are spending in stores,” said Andrew Wilkinson of Interactive Brokers. “This is a really big disappointment, and one that is going to challenge the rally going forward.”The falls came despite positive comments on the economy from President Barack Obama and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr Obama said he saw “signs of economic progress”. But stocks extended their slide after he finished speaking, with investors apparently having hoped for more from what was billed as a “major speech on the economy”.Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare group, followed Goldman Sachs in topping analysts’ expectations with its first-quarter earnings. The company said revenues were down, but it managed to keep costs low and reported earnings of $1.26 per share, against consensus estimates of $1.22. Its shares gained 0.4 per cent to $51.37.Lennar, the homebuilder, dropped after Moody’s downgraded its debt, citing concerns about the company’s liquidity position. Its shares lost 5.4 per cent to $7.78.MGM Mirage saw some rare positive news after it won a waiver from lenders to pay about $70m of obligations owed by both itself and its building partner Dubai World, which would allow it to continue to build its CityCenter development in Las Vegas. Its shares gained 5.6 per cent to $6.60.General Motors was another riser after reports that the ­government was considering swapping $13.4bn debt for equity in a new, stripped-down version of the ­carmaker. Its shares gained 4.1 per cent to $1.78."

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

But on Thursday, many were more sceptical of the move and the financial sector fell below where it had been before the Fed’s announcement.They had earlier risen as figures showed that first-time unemployment claims fell to 646,000 from 658,000 last week, against consensus estimates of 655,000.But the fallout from the Fed plan soon started to dominate investors’ thinking once more, and banks were further weighed down that a new 90 per cent tax rate on bonuses for high earning bankers at companies which had taken over $5bn from the troubled asset relief program (Tarp) could trigger an exodus of talent.JPMorgan closed 8 per cent down at $24.95, Morgan Stanley fell 13 per cent to $21.04 and Goldman Sachs dropped 5.7 per cent to $99.30.Credit card companies were also big fallers after Discover announced an operating loss of $0.36 per share for the first quarter. The company said it would cut its dividend from $0.06 per share to $0.02, and its shares lost 13.3 per cent to $6.28. American Express also fell, dropping 7.2 per cent to $13.07, while Capital One gave up 13.6 per cent to $12.30.Shares in Citigroup, which have more than tripled in the past two weeks, were particularly volatile, as the company announced it had begun plans to swap $5.3bn worth of preference shares into common stock. After an initial rise of more than
11 per cent, they slumped 15.6 per cent to $2.60.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.3 per cent down at 784.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent lower at 7,400.8 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 1,483.48.“The aggressive move by the Fed is stoking inflation expectations and there is a belief that a lot of money could flow into commodities or other inflation hedges,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MFGlobal. “This is suppressing the price of equities.”Others warned that the Fed’s actions could only be judged on a more long-term view however.“We need to let the Fed’s efforts begin to work,” said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer of Fort Pitt Capital Group. “They will help clear the balance sheets of good banks, but that will take time.”The oil price rose sharply on Thursday to its highest level this year, which boosted the price of energy stocks. Chevron gained 0.8 per cent to $67.13.Materials also gained on hopes that a weaker dollar would boost demand for US goods from overseas buyers.Alcoa the largest US aluminium producer, lifted 16.8 per cent to $6.40, bolstered also when JPMorgan raised its estimates of the company’s earnings for 2009 and 2010.The steel sector was another strong performer. Nucor gained 7.2 per cent to $38.08, US Steel picked up 9.2 per cent to $20.94 and AK Steel rose 8.8 per cent to $7.55. AK Steel was also helped by news of a $5bn Treasury bail-out for car parts makers, which lifted the big carmakers. GM one of AK’s biggest customers, rose 8.7 per cent to $2.87.There was further good news for the technology sector, as Oracle announced better profits than expected and said it would pay its first quarterly dividend. Its shares rose 9.7 per cent to $17.37.General Electric fell however after it told investors it was likely to see a smaller profit in its financial arm than previously predicted as the economy had worsened faster than expected. Rapidly rising job losses had hit the consumer-credit business, executives said, and the company’s shares lost 1.8 per cent to $10.13.Earnings for FedEx, the delivery company, missed analysts’ estimates but its shares rose 4.8 per cent to $45.10 after executives said they did not expect a further significant deterioration in the economy this year."

Schering-Plough also gained, rising 8.5 per cent to $24.21.Humana, the health insurer, also gained on speculation reported by Bloomberg that it was the subject of a takeover bid. Its shares rose 7.7 per cent to $24.83.But CV Therapeutics lost ground after Japan’s Astellas said it might not re-bid for the company after it accepted a rival bid from Gilead Sciences. CV lost 1.8 per cent to $20.67.The financial sector finished in positive territory as gains in the banking sector outweighed fears over bad debts in the credit card market. Banks received a boost after Richard Parsons, the chairman of Citigroup, said the bank would not need more capital injections from government, further allaying fears of nationalisation. Citi gained 6.6 per cent to $1.78, and JPMorgan picked up 2.4 per cent to $23.75.But credit card companies Discover Financial and Capital One both lost out, the latter after announcing a change to executives’ compensation schemes that will convert cash bonuses and equity incentives into salary and restricted stock. Discover fell 5.9 per cent to $6.23 and Capital One lost 5.6 per cent to $12.56.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both gained 0.8 per cent to 756.55 points and 7,223.98 points respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.4 per cent at 1,431.5 points. The gains followed a surge on Thursday after Ken Lewis, chief executive of Bank of America, became the third leading bank boss to say his company had been profitable for the first two months of 2009.The market was given a boost late on Thursday when President Barack Obama said he would be willing to consider lowering the corporate tax rate if people within business helped him to close tax loopholes.The energy sector put pressure on the S&P after OPEC cut its forecast for oil demand, with Chevron losing 0.8 per cent to $62.91.Palm was one of the biggest gainers after RBC Capital Markets upgraded the cellphone manufacturer to outperform from sector perform, based on its plans to dominate the smartphone market. Its shares lifted 6.7 per cent to $8.39.It was not all good news for technology stocks, as National Semiconductor, the chipmaker, was downgraded to junk status by Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency. The company lost 8.8 per cent to $10.05.Warren Buffett spent Monday talking up the stocks he holds, but his company remains too exposed to losses on its portfolio, says Fitch, which cut Berkshire Hathaway’s AAA rating. Shares then fell 3.2 per cent.

That suggested widespread selling of yen positions had left traders with cash to invest in US stocks.After a wave of buying into the New York close, the S&P 500 finished up 10.8 per cent to 940.50. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 9.5 per cent to 1,649.47 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 10.9 per cent to 9,065.12.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, often referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 16.3 per cent, although at 66.99 continued to indicate heightened levels of distress.The market’s late afternoon surge came even after figures showed consumer confidence slumped to a record low in October, which Ian Shepherdson, of High Frequency Economics, described as “extraordinarily awful.” Separate data showed prices of single-family homes plunged by a record percentage in August.Energy and telecoms were two of the biggest sectoral winners. Exxon Mobil and AT&T were among the biggest blue-chip winners, up 13.3 per cent to $74.86 and 13.2 per cent to $27.61 respectively after analysts at Morgan Stanley highlighted their “defensive” qualities.Relatively well-received results from refiner Valero helped the energy sector. Its shares jumped 11.3 per cent to $16.81.Materials overall gained 12.7 per cent. US Steel’s third-quarter results were also positive and the shares jumped 14.2 per cent to $35.20 even after a downbeat assessment of prospects for the fourth quarter.The financial sector remained volatile, with large swings, particularly in the value of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Despite early losses, Morgan Stanley closed up 10.7 per cent at $15.20 and Goldman shares ended up 0.7 per cent at $93.57.Phil Orlando, strategist at Federated Investors, said sentiment was also helped by the continuing efforts by the US government to implement measures to help the financial sector. “There’s a recognition that these programmes will be successful [in the long term],” he said.Traders also took comfort from further signs of easing in money markets and the market is pricing in a 50 basis point interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday.Wal-Mart jumped 11.1 per cent to $55.17 after the world’s largest retailer told analysts it was “well-positioned” to deal with a global slump.In industrials, Boeing climbed 15.5 per cent to $48.91 on the prospect of a tentative deal to end a strike.General Motors advanced 14.7 per cent to $6.25 on reports that the hard-hit auto group was pushing for government aid to help a possible merger with
Chrysler.Meanwhile, internet stocks were in focus after Credit Suisse initiated coverage on several in the sector. “We are cautious on US display advertising,” the analysts wrote. “Investors should position their portfolios toward what we see as more sustainable growth in search and fixed-price e-commerce.”Google was up 11.9 per cent to $368.75 after Credit Suisse placed an “outperform” rating on the stock and a price target of $400.Airlines were a key winner, up 4.3 per cent overall. The sector was helped after Calyon upgraded a slew of stocks due to “dramatically falling oil prices and the deep capacity cuts implemented to support ticket prices and revenue, which sharply reduced variable and fixed costs”.Bucking the market’s upward momentum, Whirlpool lost 8.3 per cent to $45.87 after the group slashed its full-year outlook and said it would cut 5,000 jobs by the end of next year.Britannia Bulk Holdings plunged 85.8 per cent to 27 cents after the group said there was a “very high risk” that it would default on a $170m loan.Visa and MasterCard rose 7.3 per cent to $49.97 and 7.7 per cent to $136.01, respectively, after the duo agreed to pay $2.75bn to settle an antitrust lawsuit with
Discover Financial."
39;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2008-10-14T19:24:58Z;Credit cards;;For a while it seemed that neither record commodity prices nor falling wealth could put a dent in American consumers’ propensity to pay with plastic, but the moment of frugal reckoning is now finally here. August had the biggest drop in revolving debt on record and the last several weeks were probably even worse.The fall in spending and rising late credit card payments have naturally weighed on the financial sector. Lately though, companies such as Visa and MasterCard that depend on transaction volumes rather than creditworthiness have been hit nearly as hard as those facing delinquencies. The largest issuers of credit cards are big banks, but they have many other businesses and have gyrated recently on separate concerns. Three that come close to being pure plays on cards while still having credit exposure are Capital One, American Express and Discover Financial Services and they are off by an average of 51 per cent from their 52 week highs. Visa and Mastercard’s drops of 35 and 46 per cent, respectively, are better but still an overreaction.The future of the two big processors lies in developing markets. These have wobbled recently, but if future penetration rates climb anywhere near their expected pace, processor shares still look attractive. In the not-too-distant future, developed market revenue will merely grow in line with nominal output. In the US, for example, cheques and cash already have dropped from three fourths of spending in the early 1990s to a little over a third today. Worldwide though, these represent an $80,000bn untapped market for cards.At around 27 and 20 times prospective earnings, respectively, Visa and Mastercard might seem expensive in a bombed-out financial sector, but they can still grow earnings respectably if revenue rises in the low teens, several percentage points lower than consensus forecasts. Even if global recession looms, plastic cards are one American export with a bright future.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here

DR Horton and KB Home rallied 5.6 per cent to $13.92 and 4.1 per cent to $21.16, respectively.Other figures showed that the number of workers claiming unemployment benefits jumped last week, and a sharp fall in demand for durable goods. “Industry is in trouble,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients.Yet stocks extended early gains after Chris Dodd, chairman of the US Senate Banking Committee, said negotiators had reached “fundamental agreement” on the principles of the Wall Street bail-out.The S&P 500 closed up 2 per cent at 1,209.18 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8 per cent at 11,022.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.4 per cent at 2,186.57.Christopher Colarik, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment, said: “At the end of the day it was going to have to get done [but] was it going to be decorated like a fancy Christmas tree? That’s really where there was a lot of uncertainty, and how fast [it was passed] was also up in the air.”Still, reports that the government would receive an equity stake in companies involved in the bail-out put a lid on more spectacular gains.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 6.8 per cent, although at 32.80 it remained above the psychologically significant level of 30, a sign of distress.A report from Bespoke Investment Group said: “A prolonged Vix above 30 hasn’t happened too often since 1990, and it’s the first time it has happened since January 2003.”Escaping the upward momentum, Washington Mutual sank 25.2 per cent to $1.69 on reports that regulators are trying to quickly broker a deal for the embattled savings and loan institution.Capital One Financial fell another 5.1 per cent at $49.72. The credit card and banking group priced a public share offering at $49 a share.Discover Financial, another credit-card company, which spun off from Morgan Stanley, fell 2.6 per cent at $14.82. More customers were late with payments and its third-quarter net income fell 11 per cent.Meanwhile, in technology, Microsoft gained 3.5 per cent at $26.61 after an appeals court ruled in favour of the software group in its music patent battle against Alcatel-Lucent.The hardware and semiconductor sectors moved higher. The gains came in spite of Wachovia’s issuing a bearish outlook and downgrading its recommendation from “overweight” to “market weight”. The bank forecasts slower growth in personal computer sales.Dell, Intel and Hewlett-Packard gained 1.4 per cent at $16.93, lost 0.7 per cent to $18.57 and gained 2 per cent to $47.70, respectively.Oracle rose 2.6 per cent to $20.47 on reports the computer software group will enter the hardware market.In the consumer discretionary sector, Bed Bath & Beyond gained 4.8 per cent to $32.19 after net income matched analyst estimates. JC Penney inched up 0.1 per cent at $35.90 as Merrill Lynch downgraded its recommendation on the retailer.However, lodging stocks suffered after JPMorgan reduced its estimates on eight because of lower demand.Starwood Hotels & Resorts, Choice Hotels International and Orient-Express Hotels fell 2.3 per cent at $30.70, 3.3 per cent at $27.99 and 5 per cent at $29.75, respectively.
41;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2008-07-22T20:49:24Z;Wall Street rallies as oil price drops sharply;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday as a sharp drop in oil prices boosted consumer-facing stocks while a plan to turn round Wachovia helped investors shrug off some disappointing earnings reports.Most eyes were focused on the financial sector, which staged a remarkable midday volte-face to gain 6.6 per cent as investors skipped over a series of weak earnings results to focus on the positive.Overnight, American Express reported second-quarter earnings that missed estimates and withdrew its full-year earnings forecast. The credit card company’s shares tumbled 7.1 per cent to $37.99 while peer Discover Financial lost 3.8 per cent to $14.62.An $8.9bn loss from Wachovia and some depressing results from regional banks, including Regions Financial and Keycorp, initially added to the sour mood.But by midday investors had shrugged off the bad news, focusing instead on a strategy from Robert Steel, Wachovia’s new chief executive, to cut $2bn of expenses by the end of 2009, sell assets and slash jobs and the dividend at the bank.Wachovia shares swung from an 11.6 per cent loss to a 27.4 per cent gain at $16.79. Regions Financial and Keycorp overturned early losses to gain 9.6 per cent to $11.40 and 4.3 per cent to $11.99, respectively.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim, an online brokerage, said: “Wachovia presented a plan this morning, they cut their dividend – they are doing something. This credit crisis is not going away in a month, but if we have a plan to get ourselves out of it in a year that makes the market feel good.”There were some more consistent bright spots. Western Union advanced 8.6 per cent to $27.23 after the money-transfer company said second-quarter profit had risen 13 per cent, thanks to international revenues, and raised its 2008 profit forecast.SunTrust Banks said second-quarter earnings had slumped 21 per cent. But that was a smaller fall than expected and the shares rallied 17.1 per cent to $39.97 after the bank ruled out a capital raising or dividend cut.CME Group, which runs futures exchanges, said second-quarter profit had risen 60 per cent to $201m thanks to its purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade. CME shares rose 12.5 per cent to $366.27.By the close, the benchmark S&P 500 had shaken off early losses and was up 1.4 per cent at 1,277.01 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent higher at 11,602.5 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was ahead 1.1 per cent at 2,303.96 points.The day began in downbeat fashion after Apple forecast fourth-quarter profit that undershot analysts’ projections. The news, and speculation about the health of Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, sent shares in the iPod maker down 2.6 per cent to $162.02.Texas Instruments and SanDisk also disappointed investors in the technology sector. The semiconductor makers both predicted earnings that trailed analysts’ expectations. Texas shares fell 14.2 per cent to $24.48, SanDisk dropped 24 per cent to $13.62, while an index of semiconductor stocks slipped 2.8 per cent.A $4 drop in oil prices took the sting out of the worst results. Consumer staples and discretionary stocks were among the best performers, adding 2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.Wal-Mart added 3.1 per cent to $59.06 while Starbucks rose 7.4 per cent to $15.13.In industrials, some solid earnings news helped steady investor concerns about the health of the economy. Caterpillar, the heavy goods maker, Lockheed Martin, the defence company, Paccar, the truckmaker, and United Parcel Service, each met or beat analysts’ expectations for their quarterly results.Caterpillar shares rose 2.4 per cent to $74.98, Lockheed Martin added 2.3 per cent to $103.88, Paccar climbed 4.4 per cent to $44.60 and UPS advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.11.Energy was the best performing sector on Monday, but that trend petered out on Tuesday as oil prices slipped back below $130 a barrel and some decent results from the services sub-industry left investors unmoved. BJ Services and Baker Hughes rose 6.6 per cent to $31.99, and 3.2 per cent to $87.06, respectively.
42;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2008-06-25T20:52:17Z;MasterCard settles American Express lawsuit;;American Express has reached a $1.8bn settlement with MasterCard over a lawsuit that claimed MasterCard, Visa and some of their member banks had blocked financial companies from issuing credit cards through American Express.The settlement follows an earlier agreement with Visa for $2.25bn, making the combined antitrust settlement the largest ever in the US. It is likely to put pressure on both Visa and MasterCard to strike a deal with Discover Financial, which is seeking billions of dollars in damages for similar claims.Neither MasterCard nor Visa admitted to liability as part of the settlements.American Express’s suit against the two payment processors and eight of their member banks was launched in 2004. It came after the US Supreme Court let stand a ruling that forced Visa and MasterCard to allow member banks to issue credit cards on rival networks.Ken Chenault, American Express chairman and chief executive, said the proceeds from the MasterCard settlement, which will amount to quarterly payments of $150m over the next three years, would help curb the effects of a slowing economy.“Business conditions continue to weaken in the US,” he said, adding that “the antitrust settlement …provides us with a multi-year source of funds that should, among other things, help to lessen the impact of this weakening economic cycle”.American Express shares closed 2.8 per cent lower at $40.94 in New York.Together with the payments from Visa, American Express expects to receive $880m a year for three years. However, the size of the payments is contingent upon the performance of American Express’s US global network services business. MasterCard said it would take a $1bn charge in the second quarter related to the settlement.Robert Selander, MasterCard chief executive, said: “Eliminating the uncertainty, time commitment, and expense of a prolonged court case is in the best interest of our shareholders, our customers and our management team.”MasterCard, which went public two years ago, had been under pressure to resolve the suit because uncertainty surrounding the litigation was one of the few clouds looming over its stock. Shares in MasterCard rose by 3.4 per cent to $291.51 close at $289.79 on Wednesday.Visa settled with American Express in November 2007 and made an initial payment of $945m. It used proceeds from its initial public offering to make an additional payment in March and will pay $70m each quarter until the full settlement is reached.
43;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2008-04-07T20:49:53Z;Citigroup offloads Diners Club;;"Citigroup’s chief executive moved on Monday to streamline the troubled financial services conglomerate by selling the Diners Club International credit card network to Discover for $165m.The decision to sever the 27-year tie with Diners comes as Vikram Pandit and his lieutenants conduct a review that could lead to up to 25,000 job losses across global operations, say people close to the situation.Diners, which handles $30bn in transactions a year, had given Citigroup the ability to compete with large credit card networks.A sale was part of Mr Pandit’s efforts to divest marginal businesses and free up resources for core activities, executives said.Ed Eger, head of international cards at Citigroup, said the decision was “consistent with Citi’s efforts to streamline its businesses to focus on what Citi does best”.Citigroup executives say Mr Pandit wants to increase investments in areas such as the international consumer business, including credit cards; its wealth management unit and parts of its investment banking operations.After huge losses in the credit crunch and being forced to raise $30bn from outside investors, Citigroup is under pressure to revive its share price.Citigroup announced more than 4,000 job cuts this year but regional chiefs have been told to come up with suggestions for a second round.They are expected to report back in weeks, with an announcement likely when Citigroup, which has 370,000 employees, reports first-quarter results on April 18 or soon afterwards.Mr Pandit has not commented publicly on its strategy.Citigroup said: “One of Citi’s key priorities is to drive cost and operational efficiencies in order to generate additional shareholder value. Vikram Pandit continues to work with senior leadership …to make Citi a leaner, nimbler company …”Discover, which was spun off from Morgan Stanley last year, said the Diners acquisition would add $10m-$15m in annual pre-tax profits. The deal is expected to close within three months.Founded in 1950, Diners was the first credit card network and focused on high-income, well-travelled consumers. However, in recent years, it has been dwarfed by larger credit card networks.Business leaders in London have been told to reduce budgets rather than absolute headcount, with the targeted reductions varying by department. In some cases, layers of middle management are likely to be removed.The consultation is thought to be most advanced in fixed income and began in equities and investment banking last week, where cuts of less than 10 per cent are expected."
44;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2008-03-18T23:46:08Z;Visa stages largest ever US IPO;;Visa Inc, the world’s largest credit card network, on Tuesday set a record for US initial public offerings by raising $17.9bn, providing a welcome windfall to several prominent US banks.Visa had decided to go ahead with the offering in spite of recent nervousness in equity markets and the continuing threat of a global economic slowdown. Tuesday’s pricing came after financial shares rallied strongly on hopes that the worst of the recent credit market turmoil might be over.The company’s shares priced at $44 per share, which was above the pre-IPO range of $37 to $42. They will begin trading under the ticker “V” on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.If the company decides to float its share overallotment – an additional 40.6m shares – the IPO would raise as much as $19.65bn, almost double the $10.6bn record for a US listing set by AT&T in 2000. The proceeds from the IPO will help leading banks boost their profits at a time when credit market problems have reduced revenues from many of their traditional activities.JPMorgan Chase, which this week agreed to buy Bear Stearns for just $2 per share in a fire sale engineered by US regulators, stands to make a gain of about $1.2bn as Visa’s largest selling shareholder. Bank of America will make about $600m and Citigroup $300m. The banks will cash in about half their stakes.Analysts said Visa and rival MasterCard are insulated from rising defaults and late payments because, unlike American Express and Discover Financial Services, neither of them actually extends credit to cardholders. The banks that issue the cards take the credit risk.Some analysts had said the company’s US bank shareholders may have put pressure on the company to proceed after the banks suffered heavy writedowns as a result of the US credit crisis.About $3bn of the proceeds will go into a fund to protect investors from legal claims. Visa faces legal actions alleging anti-competitive practices.JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are the lead underwriters of the issue. Bank of America, Citigroup, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, UBS and Wachovia also worked on the flotation.
45;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2008-02-04T22:04:06Z;US stocks retreat as investors lock in profits;;US shares retreated on Monday when investors sought to lock in recent profits amid fears that a weak jobs market would lead to mounting losses in the consumer credit sector.Financial companies and homebuilders were particularly hard hit as traders bet that rising loan delinquencies and falling house prices would hit corporate earnings.Investors also looked to offload retail stocks after last week’s disappointing jobs report persuaded analysts that a recession was more likely.The S&P 500 closed 1.1 per cent lower at 1,380.82, with the homebuilder sector down 6 per cent and the financial sector losing 2.5 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent to 2,382.85 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.9 per cent to 12,635.16.Wachovia and Wells Fargo were among the biggest fallers after Merrill Lynch told investors to sell the banking stocks because of their vulnerability to a worsening housing market. The shares lost 8.3 per cent to $35.53 and 6.7 per cent to $31.39, respectively. Washington Mutual, the savings and loan company, slumped 12.2 per cent to $19.16.“Trying to put a valuation on some of these financials is just really difficult when they keep coming out with these horrible earnings numbers,” said Thomas Nyheim, vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust.Separately, UBS told investors to sell shares in credit card issuers American Express, Capital One Financial and Discover Financial Services, citing expectations of rising credit losses in the consumer finance sector. UBS cut its price target on AmEx from $67 to $45, prompting the stock to fall 3.9 per cent to $47.66. Capital One fell 7.6 per cent to $52.65, and Discover lost 9 per cent to $16.34.Wall Street analysts fear that job losses could lead to rising delinquencies with problems spreading beyond the subprime mortgage market. As a result US banks are tightening lending amid a reduced tolerance for risk, a Federal Reserve loan officer survey showed on Monday.Economists received a shock on Friday after the US economy shed jobs for the first time in 4½ years but in spite of the downbeat report equities chalked up their best weekly performance in almost five years, with the S&P financial sector gaining 8.5 per cent for the week. Traders were left wondering, however, if the gain was a temporary fillip or the start of a meaningful move higher.Among the factors driving the rally were hopes for a rescue of bond insurers which have been threatened with credit downgrades. Ambac Financial and MBIA fell 13.7 per cent to $11.39 and 5.9 per cent to $15.39, respectively, on Monday after the Financial Times reported that any rescue was unlikely to involve private equity firms as they believed the risks were too great.Traders also took profits in the technology sector after last week’s bounce triggered by Microsoft’s $44.6bn bid for Yahoo. The potential mega-merger may come in for close scrutiny after Google said the takeover could open the way for Microsoft to extend its PC monopoly to the internet.The drama probably has more acts to unfold with Yahoo insiders seeing an alliance with Google as one of their best options for fighting off Microsoft. Yahoo rose 3.4 per cent to $29.33, but Microsoft slipped 0.9 per cent to $30.19.Shares in Google closed below $500 for the first time since August, falling 4 per cent to $495.43, after Goldman Sachs removed the online search giant from a conviction “buy” list.In earnings news, Archer Daniels Midland, 2.9 per cent weaker at $44.20, increased quarterly profits to $473m from $441m, but the agricultural producer’s results narrowly missed some analysts’ estimates.Humana, the health in-surer, increased fourth-quarter profits by 57 per cent to $243.2m, beating Wall Street estimates. But the stock fell 3.5 per cent to $78.98.With more than half of S&P 500 companies having reported for the fourth quarter, corporate earnings are on track for a 20.7 per cent fall in the last three months of 2007, according to Thomson Financial, with financials the source of most of the weakness. Technology and energy earnings continue to hold up, increasing an expected 26 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. Profits are forecast to grow by less than 2 per cent in the first and second quarters, before rebounding strongly later in the year.Many analysts see US manufacturers coping well, as exports are helped by a weak dollar. Factory orders rose 2.3 per cent in December, roughly in line with expectations – the biggest increase since July. Last week, US durable goods orders rose more than expected and the ISM manufacturing index expanded.
46;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2007-12-04T01:27:28Z;Discover fuels UK credit concerns;;Discover Financial Services, the US credit card group, on Monday fuelled concern about the consumer credit outlook in the UK by announcing it would writedown the value of its Goldfish credit card business by up to $422m.The writedown, which covers all the goodwill on its $1.7bn acquisition of Goldfish from LloydsTSB last year, reflected “continued disruption in UK financial markets”, said David Nelms, Discover chief executive.Mr Nelms said the disruption, higher interest rates and Discover’s decision to reduce its loan exposure to the UK market had reduced the book value of the Goldfish business. The UK credit card market remained “very challenging” and Discover would “assess options to maximise shareholder returns”, he added.Discover paid a 22 per cent premium to Goldfish’s net receivables when it concluded the deal in February 2006.Like many of its rivals, Discover’s UK business has been hit by higher funding costs and rising loan losses. Its international card business recorded more than doubled pre-tax losses of $67m in the three months to August.Mr Nelms said Discover’s efforts to refocus the Goldfish business had begun to bear fruit and it would continue implementation of “significant actions” to improve its performance.Discover’s shares have fallen 40 per cent since the company was spun off from Morgan Stanley five months ago. On Monday, the stock closed 5.6 per cent down at $16.39.The company on Monday said the board had given authorisation for buy-backs of up to $1bn of stock.Mr Nelms said it was pleased with its continued focus on risk management, stressing that charge-offs in the US were expected to remain below 4 per cent in the fourth quarter. The charge-off rate in its international business was 6.56 per cent in the third quarter.Goldfish was set up as a joint venture between Lloyds­TSB and Centrica, owner of British Gas.Discover, which has 1.5m ­customers in the UK, was seen as having paid a full price for the business, which increased its credit card loan book to £2.3bn ($4.7bn).
47;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2007-12-03T22:14:45Z;High street sales hit as consumers feel pinch;;Evidence mounted on Monday that the turmoil in financial markets is squeezing the consumer, hitting high street sales.Businesses ranging from restaurants to a sofa maker revealed that consumer demand is falling as access to credit tightens.Difficult conditions spurred a US financial services provider to take a $422m (£204m) writedown on the value of its Goldfish credit card business in the UK.Blaming “continued disruption in UK financial markets”, Discover Financial Services said it would write off the value of the intangible assets of Goldfish, acquired last year for $1.7bn from Lloyds TSB.The disruption, higher interest rates and Discover’s decision to reduce its loan exposure to the UK market had hit the book value of the Goldfish business. The UK credit card market remained “very challenging” and Discover would “assess options to maximise shareholder returns”.The writedown came as ScS Upholstery blamed the credit squeeze for lower sales of sofas as the company said more potential customers were being turned down by its credit provider.“We’ve seen more rejections on finance than we’d historically had,” said David Knight, chief executive, who blamed the squeeze for a 16 per cent fall in like-for-like sales over the past five months.PwC said last week that credit card companies were tightening their acceptance policy, with some rejecting 60 per cent of new applications.Debenhams store group said it had seen a sudden, unexpected and “significant” increase in store card use over the past “couple of months”.Store cards can charge an annual rate of interest of 20 per cent, making them much more expensive than most credit cards. GE Capital, which operates Debenhams’ store card, declined to say whether the pattern was widespread.Findel, the home shopping company, added that it expected to see a greater demand for its credit operation as banks retreat from credit.Elsewhere, there were signs the credit crunch was feeding through into consumer demand.Clapham House, owner of the Bombay Bicycle chain of Indian restaurants and the Gourmet Burger Kitchen restaurant group, scaled back its expansion plans and said its debt was higher and costlier than it had expected.Regent Inns, which owns the Jongleurs, New Orleans and Walkabout chains, said a consumer slowdown would lead to a shortfall in this year’s profits.Additional reporting by Delphine Strauss
48;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2007-11-28T07:02:34Z;Chris McWilton: Heavy lifting in a cultural transformation;;Things have gone really rather well for Chris McWilton since he left KPMG in January 2003. He had been born and bred in the firm’s auditing business and after 21 years he “bled KPMG blue”. But then he jumped ship and joined Mastercard as controller, moving up to chief financial officer after a few months.The card network went public three years later and, in a spectacular run of almost Google-like proportions, the shares have since risen nearly fivefold. “Its been a great ride,” he says at Mastercard’s headquarters, north of New York City.Analysts credit Mr McWilton with helping to bring financial discipline to what had been an association owned by the banks that issue its cards. Earlier this month, Mr McWilton, 48, got his reward. In a reshuffle designed to give broader experience to several senior executives, Bob Selander, chief executive, named him president of global accounts.When Mr McWilton arrived at Mastercard, an initial public offering was in the medium-term plan, and it already had many of the trappings of a public company. Since it had more than 300 shareholders, it was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and made all the usual filings. But culturally, it was far from an ordinary listed company. “One thing we had to do was to continue the transformation of the company from a membership association, not for profit type organisation, to a commercially rigorous enterprise.“When I first came here there wasn’t a lot of emphasis on profitability, there wasn’t a lot of emphasis on margin improvement. It was all very much about the market share game, very much a culture of pleasing the members.” It has taken “a lot of heavy lifting” to change the culture, including an education programme for more than 1,800 employees about how Mastercard makes its money.Despite all of this hard work, Mr McWilton says that there was a lingering doubt among investors in Mastercard’s IPO about its ability to deliver the sort of performance it had been presenting in its roadshows. This included three to five year goals of 8 to 10 per cent revenue growth and 1 to 2 per cent improvements in operating margins.Investors were also concerned about Mastercard’s litigation risk, including cases brought by rivals American Express and Discover, and suits being pursued by big retailers.“When we were on the roadshow there were huge numbers being thrown around …there were a fair number of folks out there trying to disrupt the IPO.”Mastercard’s timing was unfortunate too. Its issue was priced the day Vonage, the internet telephone company, made its disastrous debut, which knocked sentiment. As a result the shares were priced at $39, below the company’s previously forecast range of $40 to $43, to raise $2.4bn.Less than two years later, they are trading at more than $180.Mr McWilton says it was important for the company to get off to a good start. “The first quarter off the blocks we delivered far in excess of what The Street expected. That is a must. If you miss the first quarter – forget it.”It continued to deliver better than expected results, thanks to strong global economic growth, buoyant cross-border travel (which is very lucrative) and a high fixed cost business model where small changes in revenue result in very large increases in profits. Helped partly by these results the investor view of card companies improved and their shares began to be seen as “growth” stocks with much higher ratings.Meanwhile investors became more confident that it had built up sufficient capital to handle the litigation. (Earlier this month Mastercard’s shares slipped 4 per cent on the news that Visa, its larger rival, had agreed to settle the American Express suit for $2.25bn).Mr McWilton says little has changed in the way the company is run, now that it is public. In particular, management do not do anything differently in terms of seeking to provide stable earnings, a characteristic usually seen as highly prized by public investors.Because of its high fixed costs, Mastercard’s earnings are inherently “choppy” he says, and analysts and investors appear to be comfortable with that. He denies suggestions by some analysts, that a listed Mastercard would be less likely to engage in a price war than it might have been before. Nor has its approach to hedging currency risk changed. “We are going to do what is best for the business in the long term,” he says.One big difference from when it was an association is that now it cannot call on its members if it gets a big bill, such as a legal settlement. So it runs a very strong balance sheet with $2.5bn of net cash.“That is not to say we might not do something different in the long run,” says Mr Wilton. “We are always thinking about capital, whether we have enough or too much. We review it at every board meeting.”Mr McWilton stresses that it has a conservative policy towards managing its $3bn of cash. “Our overriding goal is preserving the capital. We didn’t load up on subprime and we were not into the commercial paper market.”“We are a bit boring. I joke that all our treasurer does is count the cash at the end of the day.”In common with most chief financial officers of US public companies, he has plenty of war stories about implementing Sarbanes-Oxley, the controversial US corporate governance legislation. “I remember walking out of this office one night and there were literally 20 auditors down the hall, poring through books and records. That was all we were doing – dealing with auditors. We couldn’t get anything else done.” But things have settled down. “It is now much more of a process than an event. It was an event for a couple of years.”The process is now in the hands of Martina Hund-Mejean, formerly treasurer of Tyco, who has just taken over as CFO.Mr McWilton’s new position is his first foray outside finance. But in the first few days he has found it has many similarities with his old job back at KPMG.“I oversee the teams that interface with the customers. The idea is to make sure they are growing their payments business as profitably as they can while at the same time making sure we make money. At KPMG you had clients who wanted to push the envelope in terms of financial reporting and you wanted to make sure they were happy, but at the same time you had to preserve the economics for the company. I had to say ‘no’ but make sure they still liked me.”……………………………….A day in the lifeThere was one big thing that Chris McWilton did not miss when he left KPMG to join Mastercard – the hour and fifteen minute commute into New York City. He and his family live just a ten minutes drive from Mastercard’s headquarters in an IM Peidesigned building in Purchase, New York. He gets irritated if he has to stop at one set of traffic lights on the way, he jokes.This means his 8am to 6.30pm typical workday as chief financial officer has given him an enviable amount of time with his family. “I also get to watch the Red Sox,” he says.He likes to spend the first hour of the working day reading his communication update, which covers everything that has come out about Mastercard or the payments industry. He then picks up the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.He tries to keep meetings to a minimum. “My management style is to encourage people to make decisions on their own. You can meet or work but you can’t do both.”He talks to people in the hallway and “walks around a lot”.“I want people to have confidence in themselves …they are smart people and if they take ten decisions in the day, nine of them will be right and the one they get wrong is probably not fatal. The job is to figure out what could be fatal and then come to me.”People’s search for affirmation of what they do can “bog down” an organisation, he says.Mr McWilton estimates that as CFO he spent about a quarter of his time on investor relations and another large chunk preparing for meetings of the board and its committees.Mastercard has a fairly centralised finance function and he travels to overseas operations only a couple of times a year.All that has changed dramatically, now he has been appointed head of global accounts, overseeing its top financial institution customers around the world.Up to 40 per cent of his time will be spent travelling, which almost certainly means fewer Red Sox games.
49;DFS;Discover Financial Services;2007-06-22T20:31:51Z;Blackstone fever fails to lift Wall St;;"Wall Street posted sharp losses this week as investors worried about
elevated long-term bond yields, higher oil prices and the exposure of financial stocks to hedge funds.Not even the successful trading debut for Blackstone, the first private equity firm to list on an exchange, could dispel the bearish gloom.Blackstone began trading at $36.45 a share, about 17 per cent higher than its placement price of $31. The stock closed at $35.06.As a tough week ebbed to a close, the S&P 500 index fell 1.3 per cent to finish at 1,502.66 for a decline of 2 per cent since Monday.Investors on Friday were also mindful that the S&P 500 index and other benchmarks faced a shake-up in their composition.
