0;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-02-24T16:20:32Z;Freeport says “now not the time” for deal with Barrick Gold;;Freeport-McMoran’s chief executive dismissed reports it could sell its giant Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia to rival Barrick Gold, saying “now’s just not the time” for any deals.“Now’s just not the time for Freeport to think about doing a big strategic move,” Richard Adkerson told the BMO mining conference in Florida.Barrick Gold’s chief executive Mark Bristow has said he is interested in buying the Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia, and has had conversations with Mr Adkerson.Located 14,000 feet above sea level in Papua, the Grabserg mine is the world’s second-largest copper mine and the world’s largest gold mine.But Mr Adkerson said the time was not right for any deal since the mine was moving from open pit mining to underground mining, and Freeport’s stock was also “just too cheap.”“Now is not simply the time for us to think about doing anything,” he said. “I talk to our shareholders and there’s consistent support for that.”Shares in Freeport-McMoran have fallen by 14 per cent year-to-date on lower copper prices and concerns over the impact of the coronavirus.
1;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2019-11-04T05:00:38Z;Freeport turns to artificial intelligence to raise copper output by 90,000 tonnes;US company to roll out machine learning technology across mines in the Americas;Freeport-McMoran, one of the world’s biggest copper producers, is targeting a 90,000-tonne increase in annual output from the introduction of machine learning technology at its mines.The US-listed company has been testing an artificial intelligence model at its Bagdad mine in Arizona, which it is now planning to roll out across all of its operations in the Americas. The move will lift its yearly copper production by about 5 per cent.“We have set an aspirational goal of adding 200m pounds [90,000 tonnes] of copper from these initiatives with very little capital investment,” Richard Adkerson, chief executive, said in an interview in London.Copper is critical to the switch away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, with the red metal used in wind turbines, batteries that power electric vehicles and charging points.Typically a project to develop new capacity for 90,000 tonnes of copper, worth about $500m at current prices, would cost about $1.5bn to $2bn and involve buying new haul trucks, giant shovels and ore crushing equipment.“It’s been a remarkable success,” Mr Adkerson said of the trial, which has boosted production at Bagdad by 9,000 tonnes this year.Compared with many other sectors, the level of technological maturity in mining is still relatively low. But that is starting to change as the industry faces pressure to reduce carbon emissions and its physical footprint.At ageing deposits such as Bagdad — where prospectors first staked their claims in 1882 and most of the best copper has been extracted — miners are having to crush more lower-grade rock just to sustain output.The machine learning model, which Freeport developed with McKinsey, the consultancy, uses data from sensors around the mine and suggests new ways to improve the performance of its crushers and processing mills, according to the company.The system found that the mine was producing seven distinct types of ore and that the processing method, which involves the use of large flotation tanks, could be adjusted to recover more copper by adjusting the PH level.The machine-learning programme is one of three major initiatives Freeport says will boost copper production by 30 per cent. The other projects are the transition to underground mining at its giant Grasberg mine in Indonesia and the Lone Star, a new copper development in Arizona.Concerns about the Grasberg underground project have weighed on Freeport’s share price, which has flatlined this year. However, Mr Adkerson, said the Grasberg project was very different to Oyu Tolgoi, the underground copper mine Rio Tinto is struggling to develop in Mongolia’s Gobi desert. “They are sinking a shaft and we are going in horizontally. And these are ore bodies we have mined . . . since the early ’90s. We know the rock,” said Mr Adkerson.Once the switch to underground mining is complete in 2020, Grasberg will be producing more than 700,000 tonnes of copper annually, making it the second biggest mine in the world, as well as 1.8m ounces of gold.“Those volumes are sustainable for 20 years and beyond,” said Mr Adkerson, adding that excess cash would be used to pay down debt and step up shareholder returns.“The market is heavily discounting the risk associated with the underground transition. We are confident we can complete it but we have to do it,” he said.
2;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2019-10-23T14:01:20Z;Freeport production hit by anti-mining protests in Peru;Disruption caused by anti-mining protests caused company to miss sales forecasts;Sales at Freeport-McMoran, the world’s biggest independent copper producer, dropped in the last quarter hit by the switch to underground mining at its flagship asset and disruption in Peru.Freeport, which is led by Richard Adkerson, had already warned production at its giant Grasberg mine in Indonesia would decline as it moved operations from an open pit to a block cave.However, the disruption caused by anti-mining protests in Peru was a surprise and caused the company to miss its sales forecasts.Shipments from Freeport’s Cerro Verde mine in Peru were 217m pounds of copper in three months to September, down from 280m in the same period a year ago.That contributed to a 23 per cent drop in overall sales 795m. In July, Freeport said it expected to sell 830m pounds of copper in the third quarter.For about three weeks from the middle of July access to the port of Matarani was blocked by demonstrations against a new copper project being developed Mexico’s Southern Copper.Freeport, Glencore and China’s MMG were among the miners unable to ship copper concentrate — the key feedstock for smelters- during that period. MMG has also been affected by separate protests close to its Las Bambas mine.“Third-quarter 2019 production and sales were impacted by protests in Peru associated with an unaffiliated copper development project that blocked access to the shipping ports and main transportation routes, mill maintenance activities and mine sequencing changes at Cerro Verde that delayed access to higher grade material,” Freeport said in a statement.The company reported an adjusted net loss of $8 mln, which was bang in line with expectations. It shares rose 2.7 per cent to $10.20.2019 has seen significant disruption for copper mine supply, with a 2 per cent fall in global production, according to Morgan Stanley. However the price of copper has flatlined because of weak demand and jitters over the US-China trade war.On Tuesday, Anglo American reported an 8 per cent decline in copper production to 158,900 tonnes in third quarter due to unprecedented drought conditions impacting its Los Bronces mine in Chile.Traders are braced for further disruptions in Chile, which is experiencing its worst civil unrest since Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship unravelled in the 1980sOn Wednesday, London-listed Antofagasta said protests in Chile could cut its production by 5,000 tonnes.Chile is the Saudi Arabia of copper. It produces 5.8Mt of copper annual, or 28 per cent of the world’s mined copper supply.In its results statement, Freeport said it expected to complete mining of the Grasberg open pit by the end of the year, while the block cave projet was “going very well.” and production would improve significantly by 2021.“The Grasberg block cave represents about 50 per cent of our underground reserves. It’s the same ore body that we’ve been mining from the surface for the past almost 30 years,” said Mr Adkerson on a call with analysts.He added: “In block caving…ore collapses into caves under gravity, so there is no stripping or mine waste. We will only have to mine about a thord of the material that we’ve historically mined and produce more copper than we have in these – all these years from the surface.”

West Papua and neighbouring Papua are militarised and under-developed mountainous Indonesian provinces on the western half of the island that also accommodates Papua New Guinea in the east.Despite attempts by Jakarta to keep unrest in the provinces away from the international spotlight, the latest outbreak of tensions and growing support for Papuans among Pacific Island nations is making that more difficult as tensions continue in the area that hosts a number of key resource projects.Mr Wenda said Freeport-McMoRan and BP should stop operating in West Papua and Papua. He accused the companies of ignoring the landowners, the Papuan people, and collaborating with Indonesian military forces in an “illegal occupation”. “I ask shareholders to review this. Look at the situation and what is happening towards my people,” Mr Wenda told the FT. “I rightfully call out Indonesia for committing a slow genocide towards my people and appeal for international intervention before it is too late,” he said. Indonesia’s ministry of security did not respond to requests from the FT for comment but Indonesian government officials have previously rejected accusations of genocide as “groundless”.BP said in response it would not take a political position the Papuan issue and it was proud of its Tangguh LNG project in the province of West Papua.“We’re proud of our operations, track record and relationships with the local communities,” said a BP spokesman. “More than half of our workforce in Tangguh is Papuan.”A Freeport spokeswoman said the US mining company supported long-term peace among stakeholders throughout Papua. “We do not tolerate human rights abuses at our operations. We also do not condone any form of violence against those who peacefully promote human rights,” she said. Freeport’s Grasberg mine in the province of Papua is one of the world’s largest gold and copper mines. The latest outbreak of civil unrest in the region was sparked after a video showing a racist attack against Papuan students at a hostel in a city in a different Indonesian province, Surabaya in East Java, was circulated on social media.Despite a move by Indonesian authorities to condemn the attack, riots and unrest followed prompting Indonesia to increase its military presence and block the internet in the region in August. Human Rights Watch has since called for an investigation into reports of the deaths of at least 10 people including Papuan protesters. Indonesian authorities have restricted access for foreign journalists and activists to the area, so information is difficult to verify. The region was annexed by Indonesia in 1969, and the outcome of a referendum held at the time that voted in favour of the transfer to Indonesian sovereignty has been disputed by Papuans, who are ethnic Melanesians.Siobhan McDonnell, a legal anthropologist at Australian National University, said the region’s resources were a key reason for Indonesia’s annexation of the area, which has seen an influx of workers from elsewhere in Indonesia. Mr Wenda fled the region for the UK in 2002 while facing trial in Indonesia over his pro-independence activities. Mr Wenda said international pressure was growing on Indonesia over its actions in West Papua, citing a call by the Pacific Island Forum, which includes Australia and New Zealand, for the UN to investigate the deteriorating human rights situation within a year. 
4;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2019-07-24T13:44:34Z;Freeport posts quarterly loss on lower Grasberg output;;Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer, reported its first quarterly loss since the commodity price crash of 2016 on Wednesday due to reduced output from its Indonesia assets.The Arizona-based company is preparing to move from surface to underground mining at Grasberg, the world’s second biggest copper mine.Before it makes the switch Freeport is trying to make sure it extracts the maximum amount of copper and gold, which is produced as a byproduct from the vast open pit at Grasberg.Freeport said mine sequencing changes had delayed access to high-grade material during the three months to June, temporarily hitting revenues and profits. Copper and gold sales guidance was unchanged 3.3bn lbs and 800,000 ounces respectively.That saw the company report a second-quarter adjusted net loss of $58m or 4 cents per share, down from a net profit of $869m or 59 cents per share in the same period a year ago. Revenue fell 31 per cent to $3.56bn.The loss had been expected by analysts and comes as Freeport steps up spending on the underground mine at Grasberg, which should be producing 130,000 tonnes a day of copper-bearing ore in 2023.Between now and then Freeport and its Indonesia partner will spend $900m a year on developing the huge underground ore bodies at Grasberg.“We are pleased to report that execution of the underground ramp-up at Grasberg is advancing according to plan and recent milestones are encouraging as we target increasing volumes and cash flows,” said Freeport chief executive Richard Adkerson in a statement.Freeport recently resolved an ownership row over Grasberg with Jakarta. To win an agreement, the company said it would build a new copper smelter in Indonesia.The company said on Wednesday that a site for the new smelter had been selected and construction would begin in 2020.“While 2019 is clearly a tough year for Freeport due to low volumes, high unit costs, high capital expenditure and a low copper price, it is also a transitional period for the company, and the longer-term investment case is positive,” said Freeport analyst Jefferies analyst Christopher Lafemina.Shares in Freeport rose 1.2 per cent to $11.79 on Wednesday.

Almost all of the world’s cobalt is processed in China.Umicore is Europe’s largest producer of cobalt-based battery cathodes, which are a key component of electric car batteries.
6;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2018-10-24T15:45:54Z;Freeport CEO says company is not for sale;;Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world’s biggest copper producers, is not up for sale, according to its chief executive.“We have no plans to sell the company,” Richard Adkerson told analysts following the publication of third-quarter results on Wednesday. “We’re focused on our internal business.”Big miners and Chinese companies are looking to increase their exposure to copper, which is expected to benefit from the growth of renewable energy and electric vehicles.With Freeport close to concluding an important agreement in Indonesia, the company has been tipped as a possible takeover target. However, ructions caused by the US-China trade war may mean that big deals are off the agenda, at least in the near term.“I personally do not believe that in today’s world’s uncertainties there are opportunities for big mergers and transactions in the industry. I certainly don’t consider it to be something that we would look at in the near term given our share price,” Mr Adkerson said.Shares in Freeport have fallen 45 per cent this year and were trading close to a 12-month low on Wednesday at $10.94.On the call, Mr Adkerson claimed the deal to sell a majority stake in its Indonesia subsidiary to a local company would create a better operating “environment” for Grasberg, it flagship copper and gold mine.After years of wrangling, Freeport and its joint venture partner Rio Tinto reached a deal with Jakarta last month to cede control of PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI) to Inalum, a state-owned company. This is part of wider government-led push to gain greater control of Indonesia’s natural resources.To fund the deal, Inalum is looking to raise debt, something Mr Adkerson said would ensure the two sides will be working on the same page.“They will want to see the operations run with stability because they’ll need cash flows to fund this significant debt they’re taking on,” he said.“And so they’ll want to see the operations run smoothly, to generate cash flows, to service our debt and generate dividends. So I believe firmly that, that this will create a better overall environment for operations than what we’ve experienced in recent years,” he said.
7;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2018-10-23T16:51:54Z;Freeport-McMoRan’s chief forecasts copper deals;Adkerson says lack of new development and electric car boom a catalyst for M&A;Deals in the copper mining industry are almost inevitable as companies scramble to gain access to new deposits, says the head of Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world’s biggest producers of the industrial metal.“We almost have to [see deals] because there is an absence of new development projects,” said Richard Adkerson, chief executive.“For some time now copper has been a strategic objective of every mining company. But the more attractive deposits are owned by companies that don’t want to divest them. So that creates an interesting set of dynamics.”Global miners, including BHP Billiton, have said they want to increase their exposure to copper, a commodity that will be in ever-greater demand as the green energy revolution takes hold and it is needed in battery-powered vehicles and their charging points. For the moment they are wary of hitting the acquisition trial, having spent billions of dollars on ill-timed deals during the commodities boom of the 2000s.However, with a dearth of new projects under development they may have no alternative but to acquire assets as the electric car boom takes off. Chinese mining companies, such as Zijin Mining Group and Citic, are also looking to bulk up in copper.New York-listed Freeport, which owns a string of copper mines in North and South America, is seen by some analysts as a potential takeover target now that a multiyear battle for control of its giant Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia is almost over.Its shares have fallen nearly 40 per cent this year, weighed down by fears the US-China trade war could impact global growth and demand for copper. The company has an equity market value of $17bn.Freeport is in the final stages of divesting a majority stake in its Indonesian operations to state-owned company known as Inalum. In exchange, Freeport will gain the right to operate Grasberg, the world’s second-biggest copper mine, until 2041.“By having Inalum as partner we think that it will be positive in terms of dealing with everything from government relations, to provincial and employee relations and environmental issues,” said Mr Adkerson. “We think it will make Grasberg a more stable operation.”The deal is the consequence of a push by Joko Widodo, Indonesia’s president, to control more of its natural resources. Jakarta wants all miners to switch to new licences and build smelters in the country to boost local production.Although Freeport and Jakarta signed a “definitive agreement” last month, several hurdles remain to clear before the deal is completed. These include antitrust filings with regulators and financing.Under the deal, Freeport is divesting a less than 10 per cent stake in PTFI, its Indonesian unit, to Inalum, which at the same time is buying Rio Tinto’s 40 per cent interest in Grasberg for $3.5bn.There have been worries over Inalum’s ability to raise debt financing because of new environmental standards on the disposal of waste material from Grasberg, which sits 4km above sea level among the soaring peaks of Indonesia’s eastern Papua province. However, Mr Adkerson is quick to play down those concerns.“The Environmental Agency has met with us and also we are told with Inalum’s bankers and given assurances that those [standards] are going to be amended and dealt with in a way that does not involve significant incremental cost to the operations or disruptions,” said Mr Adkerson.*“With the Grasberg divestment issue largely behind, we expect management to turn its focus towards capital returns . . . and growth opportunities,” said Chris Terry, Deutsche Bank analyst in a recent report.Asked about Freeport’s commitment to build a $3bn copper smelter in Indonesia, Mr Adkerson said the company was studying various funding options and Inalum would also participate.“Our intention is to form an entity and obtain debt funding for the smelter and we may well have a partnership with PT Amman,” he added, referring to the owner of Batu Hijau copper mine in Indonesia. Like Freeport, it also faces an obligation to build a smelter.Looking ahead, Mr Adkerson said his priorities were to see that the partnership with Inalum was executed “as planned”, and stabilise operations at Grasberg, which is transitioning to underground mining.Technical challenges have slowed the ramp-up of one underground project at Grasberg, while the development a large block cave under the main open pit will not start producing copper until next year.These issues will be uppermost in the mind of investors when Freeport reports third-quarter results on Wednesday.“We expect a focus for the quarter will be a progress report on the block cave in the main pit and at the Deep MLZ [project] where production was slowed due to seismic activity,” said analysts RBC Capital Markets.On his future, Mr Adkerson, 71, said he had no plans to retire, pointing out that he was younger than President Donald Trump who “is talking about a second term”.This article has been amended since publication to show that new environment standards are not expected to involve significant costs.
8;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2018-07-25T13:53:04Z;Freeport-McMoRan says its prepared to adjust production due to trade jitters;;Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s biggest publicly listed copper company has said it is prepared to adjust production if rising trade tensions and macroeconomic jitters hit demand and the price of the industrial metal.Copper, used in everything from household wiring to telecoms networks, has plunged by 14 per cent since early June on concerns about the impact of the trade war between the US and China on global growth.The metal dipped briefly below $6,000 a tonne earlier this month amid a brutal sell off that also hit other industrial metals but has since recovered. As well as trade jitters, analysts are worried about demand in emerging markets because of the impact of strengthening US dollar and higher oil prices.“For the past month, we’ve seen the price of copper go [down] and we’ve got all these uncertainties overhang the world’s economy because of the trade talk and the trade actions,” Freeport chief executive Richard Adkerson said on a call with analysts on Wednesday.“If prices deteriorate, we have, and would again, adjust our operations to make sure that all of our mines are cash flow positive. We would defer expenditures, we would adjust operating cost as well as deferring capital expenditures, and we would hunker down again, for a period of time and our company would continue the cash flow positive. But that’s strictly a contingency plan.”Most of the world’s big mining houses are now preaching a mantra of “value over volume”, saying they are prepared to cut or adjust production in response to market conditions. This marks a big shift from their attitude during the commodities boom of the 2000s where they were digging frantically in order to take market share from their rivals.Mr Adkerson’s comments came as Freeport reported second-quarter results that topped market expectations boosted by higher prices and output.In the three months to June, Freeport said net income rose to $853m, or 58 cents per share, up from $241m, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier . Analysts had been expecting earnings of around 51 cents a share for the quarter. Revenue increased to $5.2bn from $3.7bn.Freeport realised an average sale price for its copper of $3.10 a pound, up 16 per cent from the same period in 2017.The company also maintained production guidance for 2018 of 3.8bn pounds of copper and said it planned to extend open pit mining activity at its Grasberg copper and gold deposit in Indonesia for a further six months in to the first half of 2019.At Grasberg’s Deep Mill Level Zone underground mine, Freeport said it still expected to reach full production rates of 80,000 tonnes a per day by 2022 in spite of recent seismic activity that pushed back the start of mining until the middle of 2019.Asked by analysts about the outlook for the copper market Mr Adkerson said he remained positive.“As we sit here today, there is an anomaly between market sentiment and fundamentals in the marketplace. We’re continuing to see real demand being very positive for our global business, including our business in China. The fiscal markets are broadly balanced globally. Exchange stocks are actually down since mid-June and supply growth continues to be muted,” he said.“And I’ll just make a quick note on China’s actions in the last few days to losen its fiscal situation in this country to continue to support continued investment.”
9;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
10;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2018-07-12T11:27:13Z;Rio Tinto sells Grasberg stake for $3.5bn;Indonesia to take a controlling stake in world’s second-biggest copper mine;"Rio Tinto has agreed to sell its interest in Grasberg, the world’s second-biggest copper mine, for $3.5bn, a deal that would open its share register to a wider range of investors.The sale is part of a complex three-way deal that will see Indonesia take a controlling stake in Grasberg, fulfilling a pledge by the country’s President Joko Widodo to boost local ownership of natural resources.As well as buying Rio’s 40 per cent interest in Grasberg, Indonesia’s state miner Inalum has also agreed to pay $350m for an additional 9.36 per cent stake in the mine from its operator Freeport-McMoran.Once these transactions have been completed and Rio’s interest converted into equity, Inalum will emerge with a 51 per cent interest in Grasberg. The rest will be controlled by Freeport.The deal brings to an end a year of wrangling between Jakarta and Freeport. It comes as President Widodo seeks re-election next year and the mining industry grapples with a rising tide of resource nationalism from Africa to Asia.This agreement marks a significant milestone towards establishing a new long-term partnership with Indonesia to provide long-term stability for GrasbergPhoenix-based Freeport has been seeking to retain operational control of the mine until 2041 and keep key legal and financial safeguards enshrined in its current operating licence so that it can push ahead with an underground expansion project at Grasberg.“This agreement marks a significant milestone towards establishing a new long-term partnership with the Republic of Indonesia to provide long-term stability for Grasberg,” said Richard Adkerson, Freeport chief executive.Located in a remote province of Papua, the main open pit at Grasberg sits more than 4,000 metres above sea level in snow-capped mountains. Continually shrouded in fog and soaked by heavy rains, conditions at the pit are among the toughest in the mining industry.Rio has been a partner in Grasberg since the 1990s when it agreed to help fund development of the mine in return for a 40 per cent share of output above certain thresholds. That would have shifted to 40 per cent of all production by 2023.The sale of Rio’s interest in Grasberg means that investors with strict environmental and social mandates will be able to invest in the company for the first time in decades.They have not been able to hold Rio shares because of Grasberg’s safety record and its use of a local river system to dispose of waste material from the mine. According to Barclays there have been 81 fatalities at Grasberg since 2003.“Rio is on the influential Norwegian government environmental exclusion list, due to Grasberg and its river tailings system we see potential for this now to be lifted,” said UBS analyst Myles Allsop.The sale of its interest in Grasberg also marks the latest move by Rio to streamline its portfolio and will fuel speculation about a further return of capital to shareholders when the deal is completed this year. With Grasberg, Rio will have raised $7.5bn from disposals this year.“Management indicated with 2017 results [in February] that there is no need to further reduce net debt, deals are too expensive and capex will remain $5.5bn-$6bn until 2020; as a result, we think proceeds are likely to be returned to shareholders — potentially via special dividends and [share] buybacks,” said Mr Allsop.For Freeport, the agreement over Grasberg removes an issue that has weighed on its share price and could make the company a takeover target for a rival looking to boost its exposure to copper, a metal tipped to benefit from the growth of renewable energy.“Most major miners are positive on the outlook for copper but have limited organic growth potential or problematic assets,” said Christopher LaFemina, analyst at Jefferies. “We expect the majors to eventually pursue deals in copper, and Freeport could be a good strategic fit.”"

Rio released a stock exchange announcement noting a report by Bloomberg that PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum) was interested in buying Rio’s stake for $3.5bn. Rio is ready to accept the deal, said the report. The report pushed shares in Freeport McMoran up almost 3 per cent to $17.17 on the NYSE. “Rio Tinto confirms that discussions between Rio Tinto, Inalum and Freeport are ongoing, including as to price. No agreement has been reached, and there is no certainty that binding agreements will be signed. This announcement contains inside information,” said Rio.

This is used to carry tailings downstream to another deposit area.The government now wants the company to retain 95 per cent of the tailings on land, rather than 50 per cent.“You can’t revisit a system that was agreed to 20 years ago and has been operating effectively over 20 years with no unexpected environmental consequences,” Mr Adkerson told analysts on Tuesday following the publication of first-quarter results.“There’s no impact on marine life. There’s a thriving mud crab industry in the area. People fish offshore where we are. And so this is a distraction, but we have to deal with political issues, and this is one of them,” he continued.The main pit at Grasberg is located 4km above sea level among the soaring peaks of Indonesia’s eastern Papua province. It is widely regarded as the most complex mine in the world.“We had an agreement with the government that over the life of the mine, we would retain 50 per cent of the tailings on land. They’re now saying it should be 95 per cent, which just cannot be done.”He added that was “outrageous” that Freeport might have to pay a financial fine “for doing something that the government approved.”Christopher LaFemina, analyst at Jefferies, said it appeared Jakarta was trying to put pressure on Freeport as negotiations over the ownership of Grasberg continued.“We do not believe that Grasberg can operate without using the river to transport the tailings from the milling operations at 3000m above sea level to the deposition area, which is at the bottom of the mountain, basically at sea level,” he said.“Installing pipelines to transport the tailings is economically and possibly even technically unfeasible and certainly cannot be done quickly even if it were feasible.”The row with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry is the latest hurdle facing Freeport’s business in Indonesia.The Phoenix-based company has been told to sell a part of Grasberg, the world’s second-biggest copper mine, to local investors so that it can meet the Indonesian government’s 51 per cent ownership objective.If it hasn’t reached a deal by the end of June, Freeport will have to seek another temporary mining license from the government to keep operating.“Does Indonesia really want the mine to shut down, or is this more of a point of leverage for the government over Freeport and Rio Tinto in the on going negotiations? We suspect it is the latter, but this new development does make the negotiations more risky, in our view,” said Mr LaFemina.Shares in Freeport were down 14 per cent at $16.16.
13;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2018-04-06T09:43:40Z;A clean energy world needs a thriving mining sector;Nice green infrastructure requires metals and minerals;Mining companies and their financiers cannot be sure whether what they are doing is compulsory or forbidden. Or both. Governments, investors and lenders in the developed world have a growing disdain for the so-last-century business of mining. That attitude should be reconsidered if we want a clean-energy economy.For example, it has been known for some time in Europe, America and Japan that cobalt will be a necessary material for high-performance batteries for at least the next decade or so. Yet almost all the available finance for new cobalt production has come from Chinese investors and lenders.So it should not be a surprise that by 2022, according to Bernstein Research, Chinese companies will control about three-quarters of the new mine supply of cobalt, and just under half of the world’s total production. The remaining supply will come mostly as a byproduct of nickel and copper mines scattered across the globe.While Europe and America were generating slide decks and seminars about clean energy, the Chinese were buying mines in Africa. You can be certain that the Chinese industrial strategy will go beyond selling cobalt ore to selling electric batteries and vehicles to the rest of the world.Maybe one could imagine a series of miracle breakthrough technologies that reduce the requirement for cobalt for electric vehicles and mobile devices. Then the Chinese would be left with a lot of surplus cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Even in that fantasy world, we will need a lot more copper, vanadium, lithium and other minerals to raise world living standards. Poor farmers in India with kerosene lamps will want electrified houses. Africans need electric generators and transmission lines to build an industrial economy. Of course the workers and peasants of Greenwich and Palo Alto need cars and multiple mobile devices.If you think a class of oil company shareholders controls energy policy, wait until you find out how few companies control mining and mining finance. Before the October 1973 Middle East war, the “Seven Sisters” of international oil companies were supposed to rule the energy economy. They were then displaced, first by Opec members and other national oil companies, and then by smaller “independent” companies that eventually sponsored shale oil and gas development.There is a reasonable case to be made that a very short list of mining companies collectively have more of a lock on new, private, non-ferrous metals finance than the Seven Sisters did over oil. Their managements, mind you, would laugh bitterly at the idea. Every day they are beset by tax and royalty demands by their host governments, not to mention ever-tightening environmental regulations. Still, try to start a new mining company without a rich state sponsor.In the past several years the Chinese state-sponsored metals companies have managed to work and push their way to the top table. But even with today’s relatively favourable metals prices there are few real challengers to Glencore, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, Freeport-McMoRan, Anglo American and a handful of their peers.Part of the reason for this is the much more restrictive regulatory environment for project financings. All bank financing became more bureaucratised and risk-averse after the global financial crisis. But there was a sentiment that project financing for infrastructure and, yes, mining, could be structured in ways that would give some reassurance to the regulators and risk committees. That provided an opening for less well capitalised new entrants.Obama administration officials took the lead in seeking more stringent rules for what the Basel committee of banking supervisors calls “specialised lending”. When the deregulation-happy Trump people came to power, there was a belief that this complex and previously self-regulated activity would receive less attention from the supervisors.Nope. At the beginning of the year, the Basel committee, with American support, produced a slightly fudged set of agreed rules for “floors”, “slotting”, “losses given default”, and so on for the world’s bank lenders. “Specialised lending” (including project lending) would be reviewed “in due course”.While that sounds like a loophole, project finance bankers understood it as a yellow-to-red signal. As one European specialised lending banker tells me: “Project finance is [risked] much the same as unsecured corporate loans, or even higher, because [the new rules] penalise the construction period. That is not right, because well structured project finance should be safer.”Project financings are typically secured by contracts for the product or use of facilities, and incorporate commodity price, currency and interest rate hedges. The effect of the new Basel rules is a noticeable narrowing of the window to new entrants to an industry, who may be sponsoring sound investments but who do not have access to the public equity or corporate bond markets.That would include smaller mining companies. While mining may not sound as politically appealing as infrastructure, you do not get to build that nice green infrastructure without metals and minerals. Someone has to dig those up and refine them. If new entrants are not given a well-watched financial path, then the materials will be produced by oligopolies and state enterprises.
14;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2018-01-25T14:35:10Z;Freeport results shine, aided by higher metal prices;;Freeport-McMoRan has posted its highest quarterly profits since 2014 as it seeks a deal to keep producing copper and gold from its giant Grasberg mine in Indonesia.Aided by higher metals prices, the US miner said adjusted net income had doubled to $750m in three months to December, beating market forecasts. For 2017 as a whole, adjusted net income was $113m against a loss of $4.46bn a year earlier.Copper, used extensively in wiring and power networks, rose 22 per cent last year and is currently trading above $7,000 a tonne, helped by a weaker dollar and accelerating global growth.“We are continuing to make significant progress in our ongoing negotiations with the Indonesian government to restore long-term stability for our Grasberg operations,” said Freeport chief executive Richard Adkerson in a statement.Jakarta is seeking 51 per cent local ownership of Grasberg, the world’s second biggest copper mine, as part of a broader push to take greater control of its natural resources.Freeport is willing to sell but only if it can retain a big enough stake to justify a multibillion dollar underground expansion of the mine.The two sides spent most of last year in negotiations but failed to reach an agreement. Analysts say one way to break the impasse would be if Rio Tinto decided to sell its interest in the mine to a state-owned mining company.If Rio was to part with its interest — the Anglo Australian miner is entitled to 40 per cent of production above agreed levels until around 2022 and 40 per cent of all output thereafter — Freeport would only need to sell a smaller portion of its 91 per cent stake.While Rio is prepared to sell, it is not clear at what price.In Thursday’s results statement Freeport, which also operates in the US and South America, said it expected to sell 3.9bn pounds of copper in 2018 and 2.4m ounces of gold.The company did not declare a dividend.Net debt ended the year at $8.7bn, down from $11.8bn in 2016.On a call with analysts and investors, Mr Adkerson said there “appeared to be a desire” on the part of the Rio and Jakarta to do a deal.“It’s the most likely outcome,” said Mr Adkerson, adding that he felt “comfortable the valuation will be reasonable.”With higher copper prices boosting cash flow, Mr Adkerson said that Freeport would soon be resuming its “long-term tradition of returning cash to shareholders.”“Freeport reported better than expected fourth-quarter results, and management noted that three way negotiations in Indonesia are progressing well, with all parties involved expecting agreement to be reached in the first half of 2018,” said Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina.
15;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2017-10-25T13:11:35Z;Freeport-McMoran expects to agree deal terms with Indonesia over mine stake sale;;Freeport-McMoran expects to iron out differences with the government of Indonesia and reach a deal to keep operating its giant copper and gold mine in the country, it said on Wednesday.The US miner has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with the government in Jakarta over its contract to mine at Grasberg amid a popular clamour in Indonesia to control of more of its natural resources.In August, Freeport agreed a framework to divest 51 per cent of its Grasberg operations to local investors in return for retaining operational control of the mine and the certainty of legal and fiscal terms.However, the two sides have not be able agree on a number of key issues related to the proposed sale including valuation, timing and structure. If a deal is not reached it will throw into doubt plans for a multi-billion dollar expansion of the mine.The Phoenix-based company said on Wednesday the two sides had a “mutual objective” of completing the required documentation for a sale by the end of the year.“We are encouraged by continued progress in our active negotiations with the Indonesian government regarding our long-term operating rights in Indonesia and remain focused on managing our long-term business for the benefit of shareholders,” said Freeport chief executive Richard Adkerson.His comments came as Freeport reported third quarter results that topped market forecasts.The company reported adjusted net income of $492m, or 34 cents a share, against $178m in the same period last year and above the 31 cents a share analysts expected.Revenue was $4.31bn, up from $3.88bn a year ago and the company maintained its full year sales guidance at 3.7bn pounds of copper (1.68m tonnes) and 1.6m ounces of gold.Copper, which is used in everything from household wiring to electricity grids, has risen 28 per cent to above $7,000 a tonne this year as accelerating global economic growth has boosted demand. A series of outages at major mines, including Grasberg, has also helped support prices.
16;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2017-08-30T13:26:52Z;Indonesian ministries tout win in Freeport mine dispute;;A triumphant tweet from the Indonesian government this week has revealed how much was at stake in its share dispute with Freeport McMoRan, US operator of the vast copper and gold mine at Grasberg in the eastern province of Papua.After Tuesday’s announcement that Freeport had agreed to hand over 51 per cent of the shares to the Indonesian government, both energy and finance ministries in Jakarta tweeted: “#Freeport Taat Indonesia Berdaulat”, or “Freeport is obedient, Indonesia is a sovereign state”.In backing the cause of economic nationalism, Indonesia joins Bolivia, Argentina and most recently Venezuela in taking back control of key natural resource projects.Grasberg, the world’s second-largest copper deposit, was 90 per cent owned by Freeport. But in January, Indonesian authorities said miners needed to switch to new licenses and agree to build smelters to help boost local production, as well as hand over 51 per cent to local investors.
17;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2017-07-25T17:51:35Z;Freeport-McMoRan boosted by higher copper price;S&P 500 sets fresh lifetime high as energy and bank stocks rally;Shares in Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s biggest listed copper company, jumped by the most in 16 months on Tuesday as a higher copper price and news of constructive discussions with the Indonesian government over its operating licence helped offset the sting of a guidance cut.The stock rose as much as 13.4 per cent to a five-month high of $14.70 after Freeport’s chief executive Richard Adkerson said he was optimistic of reaching an agreement with Jakarta over its contract to operate in the country and run the giant Grasberg copper deposit.The move is the stock’s biggest one-day rise since last March.“We are now approaching a stage where both parties have expressed an objective of a near-term resolution,” Mr Adkerson said.“I believe we are seeing that objective being more clearly identified by senior levels in the Indonesian government than we have seen in the past.”Freeport has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with the government in Jakarta over its contract to operate Grasberg, the world’s second-biggest copper mine.Indonesia wants Freeport to tear up its existing agreement and switch to a special mining licence and also divest a majority stake in its local subsidiary to domestic investors.Freeport says it will not meet these conditions unless it gets the same legal and fiscal assurances as under its existing deal, a contract that has been in place for decades.The dispute threatens plans for a multibillion-dollar expansion of Grasberg, which is situated in one of the most remote parts of Indonesia.Elsewhere, shares in 3M took a spill after the maker of Post-it notes and Scotch Tape reported slightly weaker-than-expected sales growth in the second quarter.The Minnesota-based company said its revenues had risen 1.9 per cent to $7.81bn, shy of the Wall Street forecast of $7.86bn.Sales were weighed down by divestitures as well as the impact of currency fluctuations. Net income rose to $1.58bn from $1.29bn.3M’s shares dropped as much as 6.1 per cent, the most in two-and-a-half years, to $197.17 after the report. The stock was up 17.6 per cent this year as of Monday’s close.Investors also gave another industrial heavyweight the cold shoulder.Shares in United Technologies, which hit a record high earlier this month, fell as much as 2.6 per cent to a one-month low of $119.99 after the company raised its outlook by less than the market was expecting.The company, which makes everything from jet engines to moving walkways, lifted the lower end of its adjusted earnings per share outlook for 2017 to $6.45-$6.60, compared with the $6.30-$6.60 range it was expecting.However, that failed to meet the market’s lofty expectations. Investors had been hoping the company would raise the upper end of its earnings guidance.Until Tuesday, shares in United Technologies had gained more than 12 per cent this year amid a rebound in global growth and expectations that it would benefit from President Donald Trump’s promise to boost military spending.The declines in industrials failed to weigh down the wider market, however. The S&P 500 set a record high, rising as much as 0.5 per cent to 2,481.24 as energy and bank stocks rallied.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed as much as 0.7 per cent to 21,670.62 while the Nasdaq Composite was within a whisker of breaking Monday’s intraday high after gaining 0.1 per cent to 6,417.12.
18;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2017-05-09T04:00:14Z;Freeport fights for future of Grasberg mine;World’s second-largest copper mine under threat after bust-up with Indonesia;Richard Adkerson, chief executive of Freeport-McMoRan, has six months to thrash out a deal with Indonesia to assure the future of Grasberg, the world’s second-biggest copper deposit.The main open pit at Grasberg sits more than 4,000 metres above sea level among snow capped mountains in a remote and restless part of Indonesia. Continually shrouded in fog and soaked by heavy rains, conditions at the pit are among the toughest in the mining industry.But government interference in the lucrative mine has proven more difficult to deal with than even the harshest of conditions. Freeport, the Phoenix-based mining company, is locked in a dispute with the government over its contract to operate in the country — and in turn whether the Grasberg mine will ever be developed to its fullest potential.The dispute led to a ban on copper exports from the mine for almost four months, which was only lifted after Freeport threatened to suspend work on a multibillion-dollar project that will sustain production at Grasberg until 2041.The two sides now have a six-month window to craft an agreement that will allow Jakarta to meet a popular desire for control of more of its natural resources, while giving Freeport the assurances it needs to keep investing at Grasberg.“We have work to do, issues to discuss, but we’re going into this with goodwill and optimism about reaching a win-win situation,” said Mr Adkerson after a meeting with Indonesia’s mining minister Ignasius Jonan last week. “For Freeport, the key requirement is having assurances and a stable investment environment to support our long-term operations.”If Freeport — which has a market capitalisation of $17bn and sales of $14.8bn — cannot develop the underground deposits at Grasberg it will blow a very big hole in its future production, say analysts. Last year, the mine produced more than 1bn pounds of copper, about 3 per cent of global supply, against overall company production of about 4.2bn pounds.But the situation is no less critical for Jakarta, which badly needs the revenues generated by the mine to help finance an ambitious infrastructure programme and provide employment in the eastern province of Papua. Since the start of the year, Freeport has reduced the workforce at Grasberg by 10 per cent.Freeport claims Indonesia will receive more than $40bn in taxes, royalties and dividends from Grasberg between now and 2041, assuming full development of the underground deposit.But first Freeport needs to invest in its future. Supplies from the open pit will be exhausted over the next couple of years, so Freeport and its partner Rio Tinto are developing several huge underground deposits.They are not willing to invest billions of dollars needed to mine the copper rich ore unless Freeport can preserve key legal and fiscal safeguards contained in its current operating contract. Rio’s chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques has described Grasberg as a world-class deposit but has questioned whether it is a world-class investment.“It’s a very precise document, very clearly worded with all sorts of protections,” says Richard Wilson, chairman of metals at Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, in reference to Freeport’s license, also known as a ‘contract of work’.Facing pressure from the public to be tough with Freeport, Jakarta has not been willing to roll those guarantees into one of its new mining licenses. It has, however, given Freeport a temporary license that lasts until October, providing the two sides time to reach a deal. “The President does not want to shut down Freeport for good but they have to give us more,” says a senior government official.Under changes to Indonesian law announced in January, miners will need to switch to new licenses and agree to build smelters in the country to help boost local production. In addition, foreigners miners will need to divest 51 per cent stakes in their operations to local investors — something Freeport would find very difficult to do, says Mr Wilson.After selling its Tenke mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo to reduce debt last year, Grasberg is the crown jewel in the company’s portfolio.“Freeport can’t spend $5bn on mine development and $2bn on a smelter and expect to have a minority participation in the venture,” Mr Wilson says. “That untenable.”In spite of uncompromising stances of both sides, analysts and lawyers believe a deal will eventually be reached because both sides have too much to lose.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningFreeport has already said it is prepared to sell up to 30 per cent of PT-FI, the holding company that controls Grasberg. Freeport has a 90 per cent stake in PT-FI and the Indonesia government about 10 per cent.Freeport has also promised to build a second smelter as long as it can maintain the tax and legal certainties in its current ‘contract of work’.“The one thing that we will insist on, is that any divestment be made on the basis of the fair value of the assets,” Mr Adkerson told analysts after Freeport announced first-quarter results last month.However, any agreement will have to be carefully packaged so that government can look strong in the eyes of the Indonesian people, while at the same time giving Freeport what it needs to go ahead with its planned investment at Grasberg. Bill Sullivan, a lawyer at Christian Teo and Partners in Jakarta, says it is possible to structure a deal so that Freeport could sell 51 per cent of PT-FI but retain control of the company through voting rights. Tax and legal guarantees could also be added to a new mining license.“At the end of the day they need each other,” says Mr Sullivan. “They might not like each other but they need each other and that suggests to me that they will find a way to go forward.”
19;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2017-02-10T15:10:50Z;Indonesia grants new mining permit to Freeport-McMoran;;Indonesia has issued a permit to US miner Freeport McMoran that could allow for a resumption of exports from the world’s second-largest copper mine after almost a month’s standoff.Freeport can apply immediately for an export permit, Reuters reported, citing an official at the country’s mining ministry. That could allow exports of copper concentrate from the giant Grasberg mine.A spokesman for Freeport, however, said there is still no agreement. “Exports remain restricted as a result of the January 2017 regulations,” he said.Copper prices have risen 5 per cent since Freeport’s exports were stopped on Jan. 12 following the issuance of new regulations on exports of unrefined metals. They rose 4 per cent on Friday to trade at $6,070 a tonne – the highest level in over a year, boosted by a cut in output from Chile’s Escondida mine, the world’s largest, following a strike.The dispute with Indonesia has raised questions about the project for its other partner, Rio Tinto. Under a contract with Freeport, Rio receives a small share of Grasberg’s production until 2021, after which it will be due 40 per cent of output.This week Rio’s new chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said the company is going to “watch very carefully what’s happening before we commit additional material money into the project.”“Grasberg is a world-class resource but the question is whether it is a world-class business for Rio,” said Mr Jacques.
20;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2017-02-03T15:27:33Z;Indonesia and Freeport-McMoran dig in on mine stand-off;;The stand-off between Indonesia and Freeport-McMoran continues.The world’s biggest publicly-listed copper company said on Friday that a ban on exports from its giant Grasberg mine in the province of Papua remained in force.“We are disappointed that this matter remains unresolved and concerned about the negative impacts for all stakeholders, especially our workforce and the local economy,” said Freeport chief executive Richard Adkerson.Reports earlier this week claimed Freeport would be given a temporary export permit while it continued discussions with Jakarta over new mining regulations.Shares in Freeport fell 0.5 per cent $16.71 in early trading in New York.Indonesia wants to increase export duties and force all mining companies to convert their current contracts to special operating licences, an IUPK. Mining companies are also being asked to build or complete smelters in five years, and foreign operators must sell up to 51 per cent stake in their assets to locals.Freeport is not willing to convert to an IUPK unless it retains the same rights and level of legal and fiscal certainty contained in its current contract.The reason for its caution was evident in the company’s recent fourth-quarter earnings release where it revealed it was facing $469m in water taxes and penalties in Papua province dating back to 2011During a post-results phone call with analysts Mr Adkerson said this was a “clear-cut” example of why Freeport had to protect its current rights.“That’s what would happen to us if we want to a license without having any investment stability agreement. Under a licence, you’re subject to prevailing laws and regulations and any government can come in and impose taxes, fees, import duties, et cetera, et cetera, water taxes, surfaces taxes, vehicles taxes,” said Mr AdkersonGrasberg is the world’s second-biggest copper mine and also the lowest cost because it also produces a significant amount of gold. Freeport says it will be forced to slash production if the ban is not lifted by the middle of February – the date by which the company will have used up all of its storage.Lower production from Grasberg could further tighten the copper market if workers at another big copper mine go strike.This week miners at Escondida in Chile rejected a pay offer from BHP Billiton and now look likely to take industrial action.In a recent report, analysts at Macquarie said 77,000 tonnes a month of copper supply were at risk from the respective problems at the two mines. Copper was trading at $5,816 a tonne on Friday.
21;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2017-01-26T17:33:56Z;Freeport clears last hurdle in sale of Congo copper mine;;Copper miner Freeport-McMoran paid $33m to the Democratic Republic of Congo’s state miner Gecamines to resolve a dispute over its $2.65bn sale of the largest copper mine in the country.The settlement removes the final hurdle for the mine to be sold to China Molybdenum, giving the Chinese company a prized copper asset at a time of rising prices for the red metal.The payment was Freeport’s share of a settlement agreement reached with Gecamines, China Moly, and the other parties involved in the sale of the Tenke Fungurume copper and cobalt mine, Freeport said in its earnings statement.In November Gecamines filed a case at an international arbitration court in Paris in an attempt to stop Freeport from going ahead with the sale of its majority stake in the mine. It claimed it had not been adequately consulted on the sale of Tenke, in which it holds a 20 per cent stake.The remaining share of Tenke was sold in November to a Chinese private equity firm, BHR Partners. On Sunday China Moly said it had signed an agreement with BHR to support its acquisition of the stake to ensure “the transaction completes successfully.” It also said it had a right to purchase BHR’s stake in the future if it decided to exit.Gecamines did not immediately respond to a request for comment through its public relations agency.
22;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2017-01-25T17:49:26Z;Freeport to cut copper output unless Indonesia lifts export ban;US miner issues warning as it reduces debt and unveils weaker than expected results;Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest publicly listed copper producer, hailed the success of its debt reduction programme as it reported weaker-than-expected results and warned that output from its giant Grasberg mine would be cut unless an export ban in Indonesia was lifted.The US-listed miner said it had reduced net debt to $12bn in the year to December after selling a string of assets including oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico and a major African copper project.“During 2016, we took aggressive actions in response to market conditions to restore our balance sheet strength,” said chief executive Richard Adkerson. “I am pleased to report that we were successful in reducing our net debt by over $8bn during the year.”Freeport launched its deleveraging plan a year ago after its share price plunged on concerns about the company’s ability to service a large debt pile during savage commodity markets that have now partially recovered.Its shares have risen by more than 300 per cent over the past year to $16 but the company is now facing fresh challenges in Indonesia, where the government has just revamped its mining laws.Jakarta wants all foreign companies to a sign a new mining licence, commit to building smelters and agree to sell a 51 per cent stake in their mines to local owners. Until they do, they will not be allowed to export ore or in Freeport’s case copper concentrate from Grasberg, its most important asset.However, Freeport is unwilling to convert its contract of work to a new operating licence unless it can get the same level of legal and fiscal certainty it has under its existing agreement. It has threatened to cut jobs and investment if it cannot reach a deal.Grasberg in Indonesia’s Papua province is the world’s second biggest copper mine and also runs at the lowest cost because of the gold it also produces. Freeport wants to transition Grasberg from an open pit to underground mine, a project that will cost billions of dollars.Mr Adkerson said he had been given indications by Jakarta that Freeport would be allowed to resume copper concentrate exports while it negotiates converting its contract of work to a new mining licence.But he warned copper output would be cut significantly if the ban was not lifted by the middle of February — the date by which Freeport will have used up all of its storage.“This situation is likely to get worse before it gets better,” said Christopher LaFemina, analyst at Jefferies. “It is bullish for copper but will create continued volatility in the share price.”Shares in Freeport were down 4.5 per cent at $16.25 in New York trading on Wednesday.Freeport reported net income of $292m in the three months to the end of December, against a loss of more than $4bn a year earlier when it recorded a number of one-off charges.Adjusted earnings per share were 25 cents. That figure was below analysts’ average estimate of 34 cents because of difficulty accessing high-grade ore at Grasberg.For 2016 as whole Freeport reported a loss of $4.15bn after taking more than $4bn of impairments against its oil and gas assets.The company expects to produce 4.1bn pounds of copper in 2017, assuming the Indonesian ban is lifted. Freeport also has assets in the US and South America.Indonesia’s export ban and the possibility of a strike at a major copper mine in Chile has helped drive the price of copper, used in everything from wiring to power grids, close to $5,900 a tonne on Wednesday. Overnight, workers at Escondida rejected the latest wage offer from mine operator BHP Billiton.
23;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2017-01-25T14:09:10Z;Freeport threatens job cuts over Indonesian mining export ban;;Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest publicly listed copper producer, has threatened to reduce its workforce and suspend future investment at its giant Grasberg mine if the Indonesian government does not a lift an export ban.The US-listed company said its Indonesian subsidiary would consider legal action if it failed to reach an agreement with Jakarta, which has just revamped its mining rules. The comments came as Freeport reported a fourth quarter profit.Indonesia wants all foreign mining companies to sign a new mining license and commit to building smelters. In return they will be allowed to continue exporting ore, or in Freeport’s case copper concentrate.However, Freeport is unwilling to convert its contract of work to a special operating license unless it can get the same level of legal and fiscal certainty it has under its existing agreement.Freeport said on Wednesday that unless the ban was lifted its Indonesia arm, PT-FI, would have to cut output to match available smelting capacity, or by 40 per cent. Freeport owns around 91 per cent of PT-FI and the Indonesian government the rest.“Under this scenario, PT-FI would be required to take near-term actions to reduce its workforce, significant reduce costs and suspend future investments on its underground development projects and new smelter,” Freeport said in its results statement.Grasberg is the world’s second biggest copper mine and also the lowest cost because of the gold it produces as a by-product. Freeport wants to transition production from an open pit to underground mining, a project that will cost $18bn.Indonesian’s export ban and the possibility of a strike at a major copper mine in Chile has helped drive the price of copper, used in everything from wiring to power grids close to $5,900 a tonne.In the three months to the end of December, Freeport reported net income of $292m, against a loss of more than $4bn a year earlier when it recorded a string of charges.Net debt fell was $11.7bn, putting the company on target to reach a target of $10bn by the end of the year.“During 2016, we took aggressive actions in response to market conditions to restore our balance sheet strength,” said Freeport chief executive Richard Adkerson in a statement.Over the year to December, Freeport reported a loss of $4.15bn after taking more than $4bn of impairments against oil and gas assets it has now sold.
24;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2017-01-17T20:22:51Z;Reversal of Indonesia’s mineral ore policy threatens to spark opposition;Impact on global nickel market likely to be limited, political fallout may be greater;Indonesia’s surprise decision last week to lift a ban on unprocessed mineral exports for five years unsettled investors, especially Chinese companies that had invested in the country on the assumption that Jakarta was intent on building up its domestic processing capacity.Indonesian Smelter and Mineral Processing Association (ISPA) chairman R Sukhyar told FT Confidential Research that the policy reversal “clearly violates” the country’s 2009 mining law and that the Chinese Chamber of Commerce was “very upset”. Mr Sukhyar is a former director-general of minerals and coal at the energy and mineral resources ministry and was involved in designing the regulations that set up the export ban in 2014.ISPA remains undecided on whether to file a legal challenge, saying it needs more time to consolidate a position among members. AP3I, another industry association, said it had decided against legal action and prefers dialogue with the government. It will meet vice-president Jusuf Kalla this week.This restrained response probably stems from expectations that annual quotas on unprocessed mineral exports, required by the new policy, will be small. We understand it will be 5.2m tonnes for nickel ore — a modest level given a national mining capacity of 60m tonnes. This suggests that the impact on global metal prices will be limited. Indonesia exported 60m-70m tonnes a year before the ban was implemented in 2014.We believe the quota is modest because the government wants to secure supply for domestic nickel processing and refining facilities, the input capacity of which is expected to reach 37.5m tonnes next year.A larger quota of 20m tonnes is expected for bauxite ore, against national output capacity of roughly 50m tonnes, with annual domestic demand of only about 3m tonnes.Any legal challenges are therefore likely to come from academics, environmental activists and civil society groups, which view lifting the ban as detrimental to the environment and the development of downstream metal industries.Ahmad Redi, a law professor and expert on natural resources and environment policies, is leading a coalition of lawyers, environmental activists and non-governmental organisations that will file a legal challenge at the Supreme Court as early as next week.While such a complaint may be supported by precedent –— in 2014 the Constitutional Court rejected a request for judicial review from the Indonesian Mineral Entrepreneur Association of annul provisions in the mining law that require domestic mineral processing and refining — cases in the Supreme Court sometimes get delayed in definitely. Nor is the court, in our view, immune to political pressure.Indeed, Indonesian politics is at a sensitive juncture. Opposition to President Joko Widodo’s government is gaining momentum. Ultra-nationalists and radical Islamic movements will claim the policy reversal favours foreign corporate interests at the expense of local people and the environment.Our latest quarterly survey of political sentiment found respondents less optimistic about Indonesia’s political prospects than they were at the start of 2016 (see chart). Those surveyed expected the political situation to become more volatile, particularly as Jakarta and 104 other regional governments shift to an election footing next month.Respondents nevertheless gave a more positive assessment of the president’s recent performance, with the majority holding a positive view (see chart).The policy shift could become a “lightning rod” issue, however, as it virtually assures Freeport MacMoran can continue its operation in Papua until 2041. Freeport is seen by ultra-nationalists as a symbol of US imperialism.Under the policy change announced on January 12, companies such as Freeport and Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (previously Newmont Nusa Tenggara) must convert their Contract of Work (CoW) status into a so-called Special Mining Business Licence (abbreviated locally to IUPK) if they want to continue exporting copper concentrates for the next five years.In an email to FTCR, Freeport said it would accept the conversion of its contract into a mining licence but was seeking assurances from the government that it would protect the company’s investments and offer guarantees on some tax issues. Conversion includes the requirement that Freeport divest itself of a 51 per cent stake in its Indonesian subsidiary to local entities by the 10th year of production under the new licence, up from a previously agreed 30 per cent. Freeport MacMoRan has already sold 9.4 per cent of the venture, leaving a further 41.6 per cent to be sold.The expiration of Freeport’s mining licence will be in 2021, the same date as under its CoW. The company will then have the right to renew the licence twice, with each further term lasting 10 years.There are two complications, however – one financial, the other political – that bode ill for mining companies in Indonesia more generally.Financiers are likely to treat a licence as less bankable than a contract, thereby elevating credit risk. With a CoW, the company stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the government as signatories.Meanwhile, the conversion from a CoW to an IUPK will not be straightforward, despite a provision in the new policy that gives the energy and mineral resources ministry a maximum of two weeks to approve or reject a licence application.The coalition of NGOs led by Mr Redi is set to challenge this provision at the Supreme Court, arguing that the government cannot approve such licences unless the House of Representatives has first designated the area to be mined as under central authorities’ management – what is referred to as a National Reserve Area.If this challenge succeeds, IUPK applications could only be considered for areas pre-qualified by the House. Parliament’s chequered record of approving new legislation does not engender much confidence that such a process would be smooth.FT Confidential Research is an independent research service from the Financial Times, providing in-depth analysis of and statistical insight into China and Southeast Asia.

25;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2017-01-12T11:11:40Z;Copper prices touch month high as dollar slips;;The price of copper hit its highest level in more than a month before retreating, boosted by a weaker US dollar and concerns about output of the industrial metal from Indonesia, home to one of largest copper deposits on the planet.Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange rose as much as $122 to $5,844 a tonne as the US currency continued to weaken in the wake of Wednesday’s extraordinary press conference President Elect Donald Trump.But it fell back after Indonesia said companies including Freeport McMoran, operator of the giant Grasberg mine, would be allowed to export semi-processed copper if they agreed to new mining rules.Indonesia banned exports of unprocessed ore in 2014 in an effort to boost industrial development and increase the value of its raw materials.But Jakarta provided a three-year extension to producers of concentrate – dry copper feedstock – on the condition they build domestic smelters. That grace period expired on Wednesday, potentially threatening exports from the country.US-listed Freeport has put construction of its smelter on hold because of uncertainty over mining rights at Grasberg, which produced around 550,000 tonnes of copper last year.On Thursday morning Indonesia’s government announced long-awaited changes to its mining policy which could pave the way for an agreement with Freeport, which has plans to develop an underground mine at Grasberg.Energy and Mineral resources minister Ignasius Jonan told reporters in Jakarta that companies including Freeport would be allowed to export concentrates but only if they agreed to new mining licenses and committed to building smelters.In the wake of those comments copper fell back and was up just $36.50 at 5,760 a tonne.Freeport could not be reached for comment.Separately, trading on the LME’s electronic trading system was halted five hours on Thursday because of network and connectivity problems. Traders said that might have accounted for some of the volatility in prices.“Volumes have picked up substantially this morning despite the market only trading from 6.00am,” said Marex Spectron, a London-based commodities brokerage.
26;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-11-14T15:31:38Z;Indonesian ore export ban reversal unlikely;Mining law expected to tighten from January 2017 despite intense industry lobbying;"Indonesia’s government is garnering praise from international investors for its pro-business stance, and the growing strength of President Joko Widodo augurs well for future economic reforms. But mining and energy policy continues to cast a cloud over the investment environment.Almost three years after implementation, Indonesia’s 2014 ban on the export of several metal ores (including nickel, bauxite and copper) has failed to achieve its stated objective of spurring investment in domestic refining capacity in bauxite and copper, although it has had some success in nickel.This mixed success reflects the fact that Indonesia’s 2009 mining law — which outlined the 2014 ban — failed to take account of the different characteristics of each mineral, in terms of where the greatest value-add lies in the supply chain.Investment flows into Indonesia’s mining sector tumbled as a direct consequence of the law (see chart), while exports of minerals have shrunk to negligible levels. Chinese importers — the main source of demand — have turned to Malaysia to source bauxite and to the Philippines for nickel.Moreover, the policy’s restrictions are set to become even more onerous for the industry: from January 2017 only shipments of fully refined metals are allowed, tightening from the current law that also allows partially processed metals.Government officials have sent conflicting messages about the likelihood of a reversal of the ban, but we think it will remain largely in place. FT Confidential Research recently spoke with Luhut Pandjaitan, coordinating economic minister for maritime affairs (see box) — who oversees the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry — and believe that the government will:The minister oversees a wide range of policy portfolios, including: maritime resource management; natural resource management; infrastructure development; human resource development; and science and technology.The portfolios were previously managed by different coordinating authorities. The reshuffle of portfolios was aimed at reducing the supervisory burden shouldered by the Coordinating Economic Ministry.Mr Pandjaitan’s authority on this and other energy policies has grown in recent months. Although Igansius Jonan, a former transport minister, was unexpectedly awarded the position of energy and resources minister in mid-October following a reshuffle, we believe Mr Jonan’s lack of experience means it is Mr Pandjaitan who calls the shots.One reason why backtracking on the nickel export ban does not make sense is that the current policy has spurred investment. About 20 companies, many Chinese, have committed to investing $6bn in processing facilities over the past five years. Such investments have resulted in the complete construction of 12 smelting facilities (see chart).China remains short of domestic supplies of nickel ore, while Indonesia is one of few global suppliers. Chinese companies have agreed to comply with the ruling in order to secure supply chains.Another reason is that investing in nickel smelting in Indonesia is commercially attractive. Nickel mining costs just 2-3 per cent of its ultimate market value. Loading large barges for processing in China is inefficient relative to producing onshore in Indonesia and transporting finished products. “This efficiency advantage of onshore refining might have reduced slightly in the wake of the ongoing collapse in shipping costs, but not by too much,” says Julian Hill, a consultant at Deloitte Indonesia.As a result, we expect total nickel smelting input capacity to reach 33.9m tonnes annually by 2017 and approximately 37.5m by 2018 — accounting for roughly 95 per cent of current mining production. However, there is still room for further investment — in both nickel smelting and stainless steel production — as total annual capacity probably exceeds 60m tonnes.We also expect nickel production to fall in the Philippines following President Rodrigo Duterte’s crackdown on mining operations, which could divert further Chinese demand towards Indonesia.Bauxite is a different animal. Indonesia’s share of global bauxite supply is much smaller than for nickel, while China has a considerable domestic supply. Malaysia has also stepped up its production (see chart).There is also a significant surplus of bauxite refining capacity in China and globally. Since 2014 only two companies have invested in Indonesian alumina processing: Indonesia Chemical Alumina and Well Harvest Winning.Indonesian bauxite producers, such as state-owned Aneka Tambang, have been lobbying the government to relax the ban on bauxite exports, with up to 80 per cent of the country’s current bauxite mining capacity lying idle as a result of current policy. Output has plummeted (see chart).However, legal obstacles mean policy is unlikely to change. Unlike both nickel and copper, bauxite ores already have high metal concentrations (up to 30 per cent), meaning that processing it into concentrate before alumina refining is unnecessary. Given that the mining law bans the export of “unprocessed” minerals from 2017, there is no legal wriggle room to incentivise smelter development by allowing bauxite miners to invest in processing for concentrate, a policy currently implemented in the copper sector. As a result, the government legally has no other option but to allow exports of refined products only.Copper is different again. Production of the metal is largely accounted for by two large foreign-invested projects: Newmont in Nusa Tenggara and Freeport Indonesia in Papua. Government royalties from Freeport alone have totalled nearly $15bn over the last 20 years.An amendment to the existing law allows producers to export raw copper ore on condition they pay a 5 per cent export tax and show proof of plans to begin refining. Companies such as Freeport have generally complied, but have also quite deliberately delayed investment. Freeport’s plans are mired in uncertainty while it tries to secure an extension of the contract for operations at its giant Grasberg mine on Papua beyond 2021.The commercial case for copper refining — as opposed to processing — in Indonesia remains unconvincing, since processing copper ore into concentrate generates over 90 per cent of the market value of the end-product, compared with less than 10 per cent for nickel and bauxite. Copper concentrate accounts for the vast majority of copper export value (see chart).Copper is also highly politicised. President Widodo has refused to negotiate an extension of Freeport’s so-called contract of work, which the company wants to extend until 2041.Freeport is, in theory, required gradually to sell down more of its majority ownership to domestic operators. As a result, while it has earmarked $15bn for mine expansion and $2bn for a planned smelter, this remains on hold until there is greater policy clarity, which may not come until closer to 2019.Yet the government’s ability to force Freeport to comply is limited. An abrupt halt to Freeport’s operations would result in massive lay-offs in restive Papua, where the mine is the single largest private employer.We also think the government will be forced to continue to allow copper ore exports to continue, due to the impact a total ban would have on the recent $2.6bn acquisition of an 82.2 per cent stake in Newmont by a consortium comprising local mining magnates and Medco Energi, a company with personal ties to the ruling PDI-P party. FTCR’s conversations with sources close to the Newmont deal revealed that the acquisition was allegedly agreed on the basis it could continue exporting raw ore beyond 2017.Jakarta would have to amend the 2009 mining law in order to allow copper concentrate exports to continue. The Indonesian Mining Association told FTCR that, given the limited time available before the tighter 2017 regulations come in, the only realistic option is to issue a ministerial regulation. We think this is likely, in spite of possible legal challenges. Failure to reach a consensus would result in the sector being left in limbo for another year or two and jeopardise the Medco acquisition.These uncertainties could add to longer-term fiscal pressure on the government, though, unlike with oil and gas, the share of profits from the mining sector going into fiscal coffers has been comparatively small. That said, non-tax government revenue from the mining sector rose 27.5 per cent last year to Rp37.6tn ($2.78bn), despite a poor industry-wide environment.—FT Confidential Research is an independent research service from the Financial Times, providing in-depth analysis of and statistical insight into China and Southeast Asia.

27;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-11-13T16:48:55Z;Freeport-McMoRan chief vows to complete debt reduction plan;Miner’s borrowings ballooned with contentious purchase of oil assets;The chief executive of Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest listed copper producer, has vowed to stay with the company and complete a plan to slash its big debt load following the worst commodities downturn in a generation.Richard Adkerson said Freeport was now better positioned for an eventual recovery in copper prices after a series of asset sales.“I am committed to seeing this thing through,” said the 69-year-old company veteran.Freeport’s debt crisis can be traced back to $20bn of contentious oil and gas acquisitions in 2012, including the purchase of McMoRan Exploration, which took the Phoenix-based company back to its roots as an energy producer.James “Jim Bob” Moffett, then chairman of Freeport and chief executive of McMoRan Exploration, had long eyed reuniting mining and oil and gas operations under one company, following the 1994 split of McMoRan Exploration from Freeport.But the 2012 deals angered Freeport investors, who thought the company was focused on mining copper, and Mr Adkerson, who was chief executive at the time of the deals, made clear then that he realised he had a job to do to explain the strategy.Mr Adkerson has had a much tougher time coping with the consequences of the diversification strategy.As Freeport continued to invest in hydrocarbons, its net debt ballooned to more than $20bn by the end of 2015, just as falling oil and copper prices eroded the earnings needed to sustain the company’s borrowings. The spotlight on Freeport increased when Carl Icahn, the activist investor, disclosed an 8.5 per cent stake in the company, and took two seats on the board.As the commodity price rout persisted into 2016, Freeport’s shares sank to a 16-year low of below $4 in January, placing the company under severe pressure to implement plans to cut its debt load.“In my core I believed we had strong enough assets to see us through, but how we were going to [reduce debt] at that point was really not clear,” says Mr Adkerson.The solution to cutting Freeport’s borrowings sharply was to ramp up its asset disposal programme, including by putting its oil and gas business up for sale.In May, Freeport agreed to sell its largest African copper mine, called Tenke in the Democratic Republic of Congo, for $2.65bn to China Molybdenum, a Chinese natural resources group.Then in September Freeport announced a $2bn deal to dispose of its deepwater oil and gas assets in the Gulf of Mexico to Anadarko, the US energy producer — a transaction publicly supported by Mr Icahn.“All [the] indications are he [Mr Icahn] and his directors share our strong positive view about the future of the copper business,” said Mr Adkerson.Now, with Freeport’s net debt down to $17.9bn, from $20.4bn a year ago, and $5.2bn of asset sales agreed, Mr Adkerson is calling an end to the company’s downsizing.Last month, Freeport reported a quarterly net profit for the first time in two years. If the copper price stays between $5,000 and $5,500 per tonne — it is currently at about $6,000 after a surge last week — Freeport is on course to reduce net debt to between $8.4bn and $9.5bn by the end of 2017.Freeport’s target is for net debt below $10bn by the end of next year. “While we have a lot of work . . . we feel we proved our mettle this year,” says Mr Adkerson.But while Freeport’s shares have rallied 269 per cent from their January lows, the stock is up only 106 per cent so far this year — lagging well behind mining companies that are more diversified in their output, such as Anglo American and Glencore.Moreover, the China Molybdenum and Anadarko deals are yet to close. The Chinese transaction has been delayed by a dispute with Gécamines, the state-controlled mining company in DRC, which has filed a complaint at an international arbitration court. Meanwhile, Freeport’s bondholders are demanding higher fees and guarantees before they approve the Anadarko deal.Freeport says the Gécamines’ claim has no legal basis, and bondholder consent is not a condition of its transaction with Anadarko.Still, completing one of these deals before the end of 2016 is crucial to Freeport avoiding problems with credit lines, say analysts.“Freeport must close $3bn of asset sales by December 31 in order to avoid tripping a . . . covenant, says Morgan Stanley. “While we think there is a strong possibility Tenke slips into 2017, we expect Gulf of Mexico to close despite bondholder litigation.”Arguably the most pressing issue facing Freeport is the future of its Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia — the crown jewel in the company’s portfolio.The company is locked in talks with the Indonesian government to try to secure long-term mining rights at Grasberg beyond 2021, and is unwilling to step up investment until it does.Mr Adkerson says it is in “everybody’s interest to resolve” the various issues around Grasberg.“I keep saying that because the government literally has more than a 50 per cent participation in the profitability and cash flows from Grasberg, so whenever there’s something that affects Freeport, it at the same time has impact on the government,” he adds.Meanwhile, Mr Aderkson will be hoping the recent surge in copper prices is sustained.The red metal — used extensively in household wiring and electricity networks — was lagging behind other industrial metals until two weeks ago.Amid signs the worst of the commodities downturn is over, Mr Adkerson’s mood has improved markedly since last year.At the London Metal Exchange conference in 2015, he used a sorrowful country and western song, “If you’re going through hell”, to highlight the mining industry’s plight.At this year’s conference this month, he borrowed a refrain from The Beatles. “It’s been a hard day’s night and we’ve been working like a dog,” he sang to laughter from the audience at London’s Grosvenor House hotel.Freeport-McMoRan’s ill-timed re-entry to the oil business four years ago did not just fuel its debt crisis but ultimately led to a reshaping of its senior management team and board.Following the deals to buy McMoRan Exploration and Plains Exploration & Production, running of the enlarged company was split between three men — Freeport founder James “Jim Bob” Moffett, Jim Flores, the head of oil and gas and former top manager at Plains, and chief executive Richard Adkerson.Today, only Mr Adkerson remains at Freeport.After 13 years as executive chairman, Mr Moffett stepped down in December, months after two representatives of activist investor Carl Icahn joined the Freeport board. Mr Moffett was replaced by the company’s lead independent director, Gerald Ford, who was named non-executive chairman.Four months later Mr Flores left the company after the oil business was restructured.“The people in our company and our board, who were in favour of doing this deal thought it was a good deal at the time, but it was one which had its challenges from the very start,” says Mr Adkerson.“Many of our shareholders wanted to see Freeport remain a pure copper company, to remain relatively unlevered and that all changed.”Blackrock’s Evy Hambro, one of the most influential investor voices in the mining world, slammed the deals in 2012, saying it was “incredibly disappointing” that the company’s management had decided to “break the trust” placed in them by shareholders.“I haven’t heard anything on this [conference] call that in any way justifies why these companies should be put together,” said Mr Hambro, echoing the thoughts of other investors who questioned the case for diversification, and the close connections between Freeport and McMoRan.At the time of the deals, Mr Moffett was chief executive of McMoRan as well as being chairman of Freeport.
28;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-11-01T18:48:46Z;Gecamines vows to pursue dispute against Freeport;;The chairman of Gecamines, the state-owned mining company in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is determined to hold the line in its dispute with Freeport McMoran over the planned sale of a stake in the country’s biggest copper project.During an interview with the Financial Times, Albert Yuma Mulimbi said Gecamines would continue to oppose the deal until its position as owner of the country’s mining rights was acknowledged by Freeport, writes Henry Sanderson in London.“Gecamines is the owner of the mining rights, not the state. Gecamines is the only one to decide what to do with the mining rights,” said Mr Mulimbi.“If they want to sell they have to compensate the pre-emption rights of Gecamines,” said Mr Mulimbi, who was in London meeting potential investors.As part of a debt reduction plan, Freeport announced in May that it had sold its stake in the offshore vehicle that owns 80 per cent of the Tenke Fungurume project to China Molybdenum for $2.65bn.The proposed sale drew an immediate and angry response from Gecamines, which owns the remaining 20 per cent of the project. The state-owned miner said it had not been informed about the planned change of indirect ownership and therefore its position as owner of the country’s mineral rights had been overlooked.Last month, it went to the International Court of Arbitration in Paris and filed a complaint against TF Holding, the Bermuda-based company through which Freeport and its partner Lundin Mining own the mine. Unless the court is able to authorise the transaction, Gecamines says the deal should be blocked.“It’s so ridiculous to think they can sell that without having an agreement with Gecamines. It’s just a nonsense,” said Mr Mulimbi, who claims the company has the financial backing to buy Freeport’s stake in the mine.“We’ll see who is right, the only way to stop this arbitration is for Gecamines to stop it and we’re not going to stop it,” he said. “We’re 100 per cent confident we’ll win the arbitration,” he said. “100 per cent.”For its part Freeport, which is trying to shore up its balance sheet, claims the sale to China Moly does not violate any agreements.“The transaction is done in offshore entities that are shareholders in Tenke Fungurume,” Freeport chief executive Richard Adkerson, also in London, told the Financial Times on Tuesday. “Literally nothing has changed within the country.“Gecamines is not a party to these offshore companies, and our legal advisers have a strong view that they have no rights to these companies. They are asserting otherwise and that’s why they have filed arbitration,” explained Mr Adkerson.Congo is one of the world’s biggest producers of copper, but most of the metal is mined by international companies rather than Gecamines. Mr Mulimbi wants to change that by working with foreign investors to develop new projects.His aim is to return the company to its former glory – in the 1980s, it was one of the biggest mining producers in the world as it worked with foreign investors to develop new projects. It aims to produce 125,000 tonnes of copper a year in three years, from 19,000 tonnes in 2015.The company is also auditing all major mining projects in the country, after 15 years of getting little or no dividends from foreign companies, said Mr Mulimbi.
29;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-10-25T12:31:36Z;Copper miner Freeport swings back to profit;;Freeport-McMoRan suggested it could deal with its debt burden from growing cash flows and did not reveal further asset sale plans as it reported a return to quarterly profit.The world’s largest listed copper producer has agreed $6.6bn of asset sales this year but has still not concluded the largest deal, the $2.65bn sale of its Tenke mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo to China Molybdenum, which was announced in May, writes James Wilson in London.Reporting third-quarter net income of $217m on Tuesday, Freeport said it expected to book $5.2bn of gross proceeds from Tenke and other deals by the end of the year.Freeport is trying to deal with a net debt burden that stood at $17.9bn at the end of the third quarter, compared with about $19bn three months earlier.Freeport said it would continue to aggressively manage its costs and capital spending and said it was focused on retaining a “high-quality portfolio of long-lived copper assets positioned to generate value as market conditions improve”.With improvements to mines at Cerro Verde, in Peru, and Grasberg, in Indonesia, Freeport “expects to generate substantial cash flows for debt reduction,” the company said.Since mid-September Freeport, which is an oil producer as well as copper miner, has also announced at least $2.6bn of deals to sell oil and gas assets in the Gulf of Mexico and in California. Both deals are among those expected to close by the end of the year.Lundin Mining, Freeport’s joint venture partner at Tenke, has not said whether it will exercise its right to match China Moly’s offer for Freeport’s stake, having already several times pushed back the deadline for a decision.Reports from Congo have also suggested that Gecamines, the state mining company that has a share of output from Tenke, is seeking to challenge the deal. Freeport – which is selling its 80 per cent share in a joint venture that controls Tenke – has previously dismissed the idea that Gecamines has any say in who it sells to.The $217m of net income reported for the third quarter compares with a $3.8bn loss 12 months earlier when Freeport reported $3.7bn of impairments to its oil and gas assets.Richard Adkerson, Freeport’s chief executive, said:Our actions during 2016 position us to achieve our objectives of restoring our balance sheet strength and focusing our strategy on our industry leading portfolio of high quality, long-lived copper assets. Our announced asset sale transactions totaling $6.6 billion combined with significant free cash flow generation in the coming quarters will enable us to achieve our debt reduction targets.Freeport’s shares have risen 50 per cent this year but that has underperformed most mining peers. Shares in Anglo American, for example, have risen 260 per cent in London.
30;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-10-14T13:35:50Z;Freeport sells onshore California oil and gas assets;;US mining giant Freeport-McMoRan said it agreed to sell its onshore California oil and gas assets to private energy company Sentinel Peak Resources California for up to $742m.The deal consists of $592m in cash at its closing, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016, and an additional $50m per year between 2018 and 2020 if Brent crude oil averages $70 per barrel or higher. The properties generated an average of 28.6 thousand barrels of oil per day in sales volume, and $400m in revenue, for the 12 months ended June.Freeport said it “does not expect to record a material gain or loss on the transaction.”The announcement is the latest in a string of asset sales across the world as the miner aims to cut debt amid sluggish demand for commodities. Sales includes oil and gas assets in the Gulf of Mexico for $2bn, a stake a copper mine in Arizona for $1bn, and a stake in an African copper business for $2.65bn.After losing nearly a quarter of its market value over the past year, Freeport shares rose 1.6 per cent to $9.79 in premarket trading.

However, bigger energy majors like Occidental, ExxonMobil and Chevron edged higher 1.1 per cent to $77.72, 0.3 per cent to $88.02 and 0.5 per cent to $102.20, respectively.In point terms, Apple was the biggest contributor to the S&P 500’s decline, with the world’s biggest company by market capitalisation slipping 0.8 per cent to $108.03 to shave half a point off the index by itself.IBM also contributed to an underwhelming day for technology stocks, falling 0.8 per cent to $159.05. In fact, only 12 of the 68 technology companies in the main US stock market gauge climbed on Wednesday, taking the index 0.5 per cent lower on the day after hitting a 16-year high on Tuesday.The S&P 500 declined 0.5 per cent to 2,175.4, the Dow Jones shed 0.4 per cent to 18,481.5 and the Nasdaq fell 0.8 per cent to 5,217.7.

However, the price of US crude oil has tumbled about 20 per cent since then.Freeport-McMoRan has also struggled amid a broader decline in the price of commodities, including copper. Its shares are off by almost 50 per cent over the past 12 months.

This could take the form of further outright asset sales, minority interest transaction, or even an equity issuance.”Freeport shares have advanced 63 per cent so far this year, with their performance at the start of the week also buoyed by a broader rally among miners.Oil prices received a shot in the arm after analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded their crude price forecasts. That in turn ignited a rally in shares of energy companies, with the S&P 500 energy sector rising 1.6 per cent and posting the biggest gains along with the materials sector on the benchmark index.At the close in New York, the S&P 500 had advanced 1 per cent to 2,066.66 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 1 per cent to 17,710.71. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2 per cent to 4,775.46.Gold miners climbed on the back of a stronger physical price as the precious metal surged as much as 1.2 per cent to $1,288.83 an ounce earlier in the day, following soft economic data out of China.Shares in Newmont Mining advanced 4 per cent to $35.42, Barrick Gold climbed 2.7 per cent to $18.91 and Goldcorp rose 3 per cent to $18.49. Miners held their advance even as gold pared its gains, ending the day 0.1 per cent higher at $1,274.66 an ounce.“The miners are benefiting from the general sentiment that bad data out of China could draw another round of stimulus,” said Jeremy Sussman, an analyst at Clarksons Platou Securities. “Miners tend to do well when data suggests a degree of uncertainty.”Elsewhere, Apple shares advanced 3.7 per cent to $93.88 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a $1bn plus stake in the iPhone maker.Shares in the world’s largest company had declined 14 per cent so far this year as of last week after the company disclosed is first quarterly revenue drop in 13 years and its first drop in iPhone sales.Anacor Pharmaceuticals surged more than 57 per cent to $100.67 after Pfizer said it would buy the company for $5.2bn.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

The S&P 500 energy index finished the day 1.6 per cent higher. Meanwhile, a more than 6 per cent rally in shares of Freeport-McMoRan helped the S&P 500 material sector log gains of 1.6 per cent.Elsewhere shares in Apple, the world’s largest company, ended the day 3.7 per cent higher at $93.88, after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a $1bn plus stake in the iPhone maker.

35;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-05-16T11:26:30Z;China Molybdenum: changing tune;Miner’s newly acquired assets are transformational;"China Molybdenum’s corporate anthem needs an update. Its current theme — the sun rising over the hills of Luoyang — is now much less global than the company itself. Over the weekend, the Hong Kong- and Shanghai-listed company, with a market value of $7.5bn, said it had a deal to buy assets from Anglo American and Freeport-McMoRan for $4.2bn. On Monday, the Hong Kong shares opened after a week’s suspension. They rose 8 per cent.The new assets are transformational. Last year, China Moly (usually referred to as CMOC) earned more than half of its revenues and three-fifths of its gross profit from molybdenum and tungsten, elements used in making steel and alloys. Copper accounted for most of the balance. Freeport-McMoRan’s Democratic Republic of Congo copper and cobalt assets alone will nearly quadruple CMOC’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Its copper reserves and resources will septuple. The company’s reliance on steel will be significantly reduced, but it is not simply shifting towards copper. Cobalt is used in rechargeable batteries — such as those used in electric vehicles — and the Anglo American assets include minerals for use in fertilisers.Even amid the steel downturn, CMOC can afford the purchases. It has net cash of more than $700m. Last year, despite falls of 30 per cent in the prices of molybdenum and tungsten (and 20 per cent in copper) it managed a net profit and positive operating cash flow. It has enviably low operating costs; just above $4/lb in moly, far lower than the $7/lb achieved by world number one producer Freeport-McMoRan.The diversification is welcome. There are motivated sellers, and while concerns bubble around commodity speculation in China, more stimulus is expected to spur demand. Meanwhile, residential property starts have been picking up with a recovery in prices. So long as that continues, the company ditty will only get more upbeat.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
36;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-05-10T01:05:35Z;Freeport-McMoRan mired in Indonesian uncertainty;US company is struggling to secure a contract extension at vast Papua copper and gold mine;"Richard Adkerson calls Grasberg the most complex mine in the world, and it is difficult to argue with Freeport-McMoRan’s chief executive.Situated 4km above sea level among the soaring peaks of Indonesia’s eastern Papua province, Freeport’s Grasberg mine bores into rain-soaked land prone to earthquakes as well as separatist violence. Tens of thousands of people work alongside huge diggers and trucks at what is one of the world’s largest copper and gold assets, with reserves worth almost $100bn at today’s prices.This explains why Grasberg has been the foundation of Freeport’s place as the world’s largest listed copper mining company for almost 30 years. But now that control is mired in uncertainty, with Freeport struggling to gain approval from the Indonesian government for an extension to its Grasberg contract, amid nationalist desire to control more natural resources in Southeast Asia’s largest economy.“We have a current need to get this resolved,” says Mr Adkerson in an interview with the Financial times. “There is growing pressure, growing concern and a growing need for us to act.”With the mining sector braced for a long commodities downturn, the dispute is an illustration of how the balance of power may be shifting between natural resources companies wanting to protect investments and governments demanding a greater share of falling revenues. And in Indonesia the question of whether to extend Freeport’s contract at Grasberg has become a test of the administration of President Joko Widodo and his pledge to court foreign investment.The agreement allowing Freeport to mine at Grasberg expires in 2021 and Freeport insists it has the right to renew this “contract of work” for two more decades, to 2041. But while Freeport last year received assurances from Sudirman Said, the Indonesian mining minister, about an extension, nothing is finalised.Rizal Ramli, one of the most outspoken members of Mr Widodo’s cabinet, insists Freeport has been given no assurances on its contract, saying: “They have to change the way they operate in Indonesia.”Freeport, which is seeking to cut its large debt load amid the commodities downturn, says $5bn of planned investment over the next five years at Grasberg is at risk.So far Freeport has invested on the basis of assurances from the government, but Mr Adkerson says: “In today’s world, where shareholders are questioning the company on capital spending . . . we are experiencing increasing shareholder concern about our continuing to do that.”Freeport’s figures make Grasberg’s significance clear. Last year, even with commodity prices at multiyear lows, the mine contributed $3bn, or 20 per cent, of Freeport’s revenue; this year should be more lucrative, with copper output expected to almost double and gold production to be 50 per cent higher.Grasberg is assuming increased importance to Freeport as the company sells other key assets to reduce its borrowings. On Monday, it announced an agreement to sell its Tenke copper mine in Africa for $2.65bn.But Grasberg’s importance also shows why the mine is such a lightning rod in Indonesia for critics.Among other things, Freeport has been strongly criticised by environmental groups and some investors over the way Grasberg’s waste is discharged into a local river.“Of all the companies that operate in Indonesia [Freeport] is the one that is most vilified, from nationalists to environmentalists,” says Paul Rowland, a Jakarta-based political analyst. Public scrutiny of Freeport “means it’s very difficult to put together an agreement with them”, he adds.After Jakarta banned miners from exporting unprocessed ore in 2014, Freeport struck a deal to expand smelter capacity and pay higher royalties and export duties.Freeport has also pledged to divest up to 20 per cent of its local unit. At the moment the miner owns more than 90 per cent of PT-FI, the local company that runs Grasberg, with less than 10 per cent in state hands.Mr Adkerson says an initial public offering locally of PT-FI could help Freeport be seen as more Indonesian. But as with much connected with Grasberg, the two sides are at odds.The Indonesian government has said the sale of a 10.64 per cent stake in PT-FI should be worth $630m, but Freeport says fair market value would be closer to $1.7bn. A recent report by Deutsche Bank analysts estimates the 10.64 per cent stake could be worth $1.2bn to $1.7bn.Freeport is not the only miner concerned with Grasberg. Rio Tinto helped to fund part of the mine’s development and is therefore set to get a 40 per cent share of output from 2021 — but only if the contract with Indonesia is renewed.Ultimately Freeport could seek international arbitration, but Mr Adkerson says: “We continue to work to avoid having to resort to that dispute resolution process — we do not believe that would be positive for Indonesia or for our company.”Mr Widodo’s government appears divided on how to deal with Freeport’s contract extension, and critics say the case has exposed the president’s weaknesses.Conscious of the adverse commodities environment, the government has pledged to revise its mining regulations this year.Sujatmiko, a mining ministry spokesperson who goes by one name, says Jakarta is reviewing the obligation on mining companies to develop processing and refinery facilities, as well as the timelines set to renew contracts.“We realise that the global climate on investment in the mining sector has significantly changed compared to the period when the Indonesian mining law was set,” he adds.Others in the government are less willing to acknowledge the miner’s requests for early resolution of Grasberg’s future.Luhut Panjaitan, a former general and close ally of Mr Widodo, has insisted discussions on the contract extension can begin only in 2019 and implored Freeport to “respect” local regulations.“This is more about politics,” says Erwan Teguh, head of research at CIMB Securities in Jakarta. “For [Mr Widodo] to say ‘I will stick to the law and say I can only negotiate with you in 2019’ — politically that makes [more] sense for him than succumbing to a lobby.”Late last year a political scandal highlighted the difficulties Freeport-McMoRan faces in Indonesia as it pushes to safeguard its right to operate the Grasberg copper and gold mine.Amid rising tensions between Freeport and the Indonesian government, the speaker in the lower house of parliament was accused of trying to extort a stake in the US mining company’s local unit in return for help in extending its contract in the country.A televised investigation by the House of Representatives’ ethics committee put the issue at the centre of public debate, with secret tapes that allegedly recorded Setya Novanto’s conversation with Freeport executives.Although Mr Novanto said his comments that Freeport should award shares in its local unit to President Joko Widodo were made in jest, he resigned from his position of speaker in the House of Representatives in December, and the scandal was termed Indonesia’s “Watergate moment” by political analysts and foreign media.Given that Sudirman Said, the mining minister, filed a complaint about Mr Novanto, some political analysts say the parliamentary investigation lent credibility to Mr Widodo’s government, showing high-level corruption would no longer be tolerated.Mr Widodo, a furniture salesman turned politician, has a reputation for clean governance and won the presidential election in 2014 on an anti-corruption platform. Few in Jakarta ever believed Mr Widodo was involved in the alleged extortion.But sceptics say the saga reflects deep divisions within Mr Widodo’s cabinet, where there are signs of growing nationalism, with some officials eager to curtail Freeport’s power in the remote Papua province.“It is very important for the president to control all of this, to show his commitment and control his ministers,” says Marwan Batubara, executive director of Indonesia Resources Study, a research body."
37;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-05-09T16:05:45Z;Freeport sells key copper mine for $2.7bn to China Molybdenum;US mining company aims to cut its debt load through disposals, including an important African asset;Freeport-McMoRan on Monday outlined plans to sell its largest African copper mine to China Molybdenum for $2.65bn, in the US mining company’s most decisive step so far to reduce its $20bn debt load.The sale of the Tenke Fungurume mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo will be seen as one of the mining industry’s biggest forced sales after a steep commodity downturn that has pushed several companies to take drastic action to shore up their balance sheets.It is the second large acquisition within two weeks by China Molybdenum, a Chinese natural resources group that said this month it wanted to expand its global presence. CMOC last month agreed to buy Brazilian assets from Anglo American, another miner with a large debt load, for $1.5bn.Freeport is the world’s largest listed copper miner, and also made an expensive and contentious expansion into oil and gas in 2012, but last year’s plunge in commodity prices put pressure on the company to reduce its debts.Richard Adkerson, chief executive, is willing to consider offloading big assets, and Freeport in February sold a 13 per cent stake in its Morenci copper mine in the US to Sumitomo Metals of Japan for $1bn.“Since the start of 2016, we have announced over $4bn in asset sale transactions,” Mr Adkerson said on Monday. “We are committed to our immediate objective of reducing debt while retaining a large portfolio of high quality assets and resources and a leading position in the global copper industry.” Freeport recorded net debt of $20bn at March 31.The Tenke mine produced 204,000 tonnes of copper last year, generating revenue of $1.4bn and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $513m, according to CMOC.Steele Li, executive chairman of CMOC, said: “Tenke is well positioned to generate strong cash flow throughout the commodity cycle and, by virtue of its substantial mineral endowment, to continue producing high-grade copper for decades to come.”Freeport controls 56 per cent of Tenke, one of the five big mines in its portfolio.A further 24 per cent of Tenke is owned by Canada’s Lundin Mining, which has three months in which to exercise a right of first refusal to buy the stake Freeport is proposing to sell to CMOC. The remaining 20 per cent is owned by Congo’s state mining group.Fraser Phillips, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the price for Tenke implied a flat long-term copper price of $2.57 per pound, compared with $2.94/lb in the Morenci deal.“The lower implied valuation for Tenke likely reflects the fact that Sumitomo was an existing shareholder in Morenci and the much higher geopolitical risk in the DRC,” he added.Tenke was developed by Phelps Dodge before its $26bn acquisition by Freeport in 2007.CMOC may pay a further $120m to Freeport if the prices of copper and cobalt — an industrial metal secured as a byproduct of mining at Tenke — reach certain levels by 2019.In a further potential deal with CMOC, Freeport is in talks with the Chinese group over a sale of more cobalt assets for $100m, including a refinery in Finland. Cobalt is used in batteries in mobile phones and electric vehicles.CMOC’s $1.5bn deal for Anglo’s niobium and phosphate assets in April came after it bought the Northparkes copper mine in Australia from Rio Tinto in 2013.
38;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-05-09T11:01:48Z;Freeport to sell Congo copper mine for $2.65bn;;Freeport McMoRan has struck a deal to sell its stake in a vast Congo copper mine to China Molybdenum (CMOC) for $2.65bn in cash as the US miner and oil producer steps up efforts to reduce its debt load.Plunging oil and copper prices have affected Freeport’s ability to pay down its large debt burden. Net debt stood at more than $20bn at the end of March, compared to the company’s market capitalisation of $15.4bn.In response, the company has cut its oil and gas workforce and embarked on an asset disposal programme.Under the terms of the deal announced on Monday, Freeport will be selling its 70 per cent stake in TF Holdings, a Bermuda holding company that indirectly owns an 80 per cent interest in Tenke Fungurume Mining – a vast copper mining project in the south-eastern Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of Congo.Freeport could receive an additional $120m if prices for copper and cobalt reaches a certain level between 2018 and 2019.This is unlikely to be Freeport’s last deal with CMOC. The company said in a statement that it is in exclusive talks to see its interests in Freeport Cobalt, its Finnish mine to market solution business for cobalt products, and the Kisanfu Exploration project in Congo to CMOC for $100m and $50m respectively.Last month, CMOC also snapped up one of Anglo American’s largest Brazilian business for $1.5bn.CMOC, which is listed in Shanghai and Hong Kong, is one of the world’s largest molybdenum and tungsten producers, and Australia’s fourth largest producer of copper.The Chinese company’s key operating assets include Sandaozhuang molybdenum-tungsten mine and facilities located in Luoyang, China as well as the Northparkes copper-gold mine located in New South Wales, Australia.
39;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-04-26T17:35:46Z;Freeport to cut quarter of oil jobs;Efforts to find buyer for crude business stall;Freeport-McMoRan is cutting a quarter of the workforce in its oil and gas division after failing to secure a buyer for the business.On Tuesday, the US copper miner and oil producer — which has been trying to reduce its debt by $20bn — posted a $4.2bn net loss for the first three months of the year, as commodity prices continued to fall.Freeport is among the miners facing severe financial pressure because of the sharp decline in prices, and the strain of supporting high levels of debt. It had increased its borrowing significantly in 2012, as it sought to gain greater exposure to oil and gas through two deals that angered some shareholders.Freeport is now trying to agree deals to sell assets and cut debt, announcing $1.3bn of transactions involving its copper projects in the first quarter. But while the miner expects talks over more asset sales to yield results by June, it said efforts to sell its entire oil and gas business — which has onshore and offshore US operations — had stalled.“Further weakening in oil and gas prices and negative credit and financing market conditions . . . had a significant unfavourable impact on the process,” Freeport said. “A number of parties have interest in select assets . . . in the interim, [we are] taking immediate steps to reduce oil and gas costs further.”On a conference call with investors, Richard Adkerson, chief executive, said it was “a tough market”.“We looked for potential buyers aggressively,” he said. “We just concluded that the values that would be available did not reflect the long-term value of those assets.”A 25 per cent cut to the oil and gas division’s workforce — which will result in a $40m charge in this quarter — will now follow Freeport’s restructuring of the management of that business. It had operated largely as a standalone subsidiary of Freeport since the 2012 acquisitions of Plains Exploration and McMoRan Exploration.James Flores, the former chief executive of Plains who became chief executive of Freeport Oil & Gas, left the business this month along with other senior managers. His unit was “being restructured as an operating division”, Freeport said.Freeport’s $4.2bn quarterly net loss included $4bn of charges, mainly linked to cuts to the carrying values of oil and gas assets. That compares with a $2.5bn loss in the same period of 2015. Stripping out charges, Freeport reported an adjusted net quarterly loss of $197m.Freeport had $20.8bn of debt and $330m of cash on its balance sheet at the end of March.Mr Adkerson said he was confident asset sales would be agreed. “We are much more confident today than we were during the first quarter when the market was in such a concerning situation,” he said, noting a “scarcity of quality assets in copper”.While copper prices have fallen, most mining groups continue to believe the commodity has relatively strong long-term growth potential, given expectations for supply and demand.“We are putting our highest priority on our balance sheet . . . we would look for opportunities involving any of our assets,” Mr Adkerson said. “We want to get this thing done . . . we have a real sense of urgency.”Freeport shares fell 3 per cent early in US trading.

The company is trying to sell assets to pay down borrowing, writes James Wilson in London.In the first quarter Freeport struck deals to sell $1.3bn of mining assets. But the Arizona-based group said its efforts to sell its oil and gas business had been bogged down. The company said:Further weakening in oil and gas prices and negative credit and financing market conditions during first-quarter 2016 had a significant unfavorable impact on the process. While the process did not identify a buyer for the entire oil and gas business, a number of parties have interest in select assets, and FCX continues to engage in discussions with parties interested in potential asset or joint venture transactions.Last month Freeport said James Flores, chief executive of its oil and gas business, would depart along with a trio of other senior executives. The group had run Freeport’s oil and gas business since the miner acquired Plains Exploration in 2013 – one of the deals that contributed to Freeport’s debt burden.“The newly structured oil and gas management team is actively engaged in managing costs and developing plans to preserve and enhance asset values. FCX expects to record a charge of approximately $40 million in second-quarter 2016 associated with workforce reductions and other restructuring costs,” Freeport said on Tuesday as it announced the 25 per cent workforce cut.
41;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-03-15T08:43:25Z;Antofagasta drops final dividend as copper price slide bites;Mining group follows rivals as it builds capacity to take advantage of future recovery;Antofagasta will not issue a final dividend following a steep fall in earnings, becoming the latest copper producer to sharply adjust its payout to investors following a slide in the price of the metal last year.Pre-tax profits from the miner’s core business fell from $1.5bn to $259m, with a fall of almost 10 per cent in the volume of copper sales adding to the pain of a 24 per cent fall in price during the year, according to the 2015 annual results.Antofagasta said its recommendation not to pay a final dividend was in line with its policy to pay out at least 35 per cent of annual earnings, which was achieved with the interim dividend.Shares in the group fell 11 per cent after the news on Tuesday morning.Within the past few months copper miners including Freeport-McMoRan, Glencore and Anglo American have suspended dividend payments while Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton have decided to abandon longstanding ambitions not to cut the payout for investors.Antofagasta spent $1bn last year to buy a half-share in the Zaldivar copper mine in Chile from Barrick Gold. The FTSE 100 miner further increased its focus on its core business by selling a water utility in Chile.“The year was one of change and the group has emerged stronger, more focused on its core business and operating at significantly lower costs,” said Diego Hernandez, chief executive.This year Antofagasta said the contribution from Zaldivar and the ramp-up of its Antucoya project could push output to its highest annual level, while operating costs should fall to 2012 levels. Antofagasta has been battling rising costs for power and water in Chile.Each of its mines was generating operating cash flow, Mr Hernandez said.“We know that copper is a cyclical industry and as a result of the actions that we have taken over the past year we will be positioned to benefit from the recovery when it comes,” he said. “In the meantime, our focus is on optimising our operations and projects under construction to cut costs and free up cash flow whilst retaining the flexibility to accelerate investment for future growth if circumstances are appropriate.”Antofagasta’s net annual income fell from $851m to $702m, including $602m related to the sale of, and earnings from, its water business. Net earnings from continuing operations fell from $422m to $5.5m.Sales fell 34 per cent to $3.4bn while pre-tax profits from continuing operations fell from $1.5bn to $259m, and operating cash flow was down 66 per cent to $858m.Antofagasta said it expected its share of Zaldivar’s output to be at leat 50,000 tonnes, with $15m to $20m of synergies achieved from integrating the mine into its business.Net debt at the end of last year rose to $525m after the Zaldivar purchase compared with net cash of $315m at the end of 2014. Antofagasta said it would take out a loan to finance 50 per cent of the $1bn purchase price “to preserve the group’s financing flexibility”.

That compared with analysts’ expectations for earnings of 21 cents a share, on sales of $4bn.However, the company’s net loss widened to $131m, or 43 cents a share, compared with $35m, or 11 cents, a share in the year-ago period.The retailer said that its selling, general and administrative (SG & A) expenses decreased by $218m, or 270 basis points, compared with the previous year.“Although it looks like a big bottom-line beat . . . the entire beat came on SG & A, which in our view isn’t the highest quality,” said Paul Lejuez, an analyst at Citi, but he noted that the beat was “likely to scare some shorts”.“Still, the company seems to be making some improvements to business, which, when combined with easier comparisons, is likely to generate reasonably good results in the near term,” he said.Same-store sales, a key industry metric, advanced 4.1 per cent in line with forecasts.JC Penney has been a bright spot in the department-store sector — with same-store sales declining 4.8 per cent at Macy’s, 2 per cent at Dillard’s and 7.1 per cent at Sears Holdings — amid the rise of ecommerce and competition from off-price retailers such as TJX Cos.Marvin Ellison, chief executive, noted that JC Penney continued to “win market share in a competitive environment”.JC Penney also said it expected adjusted earnings per share to be positive in 2016.Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, said it was “a faster than expected return to profitability”.JC Penney has worked to reinvent itself after a failed turnround led by Ron Johnson, former Apple executive, alienated customers. The retailer has since brought back its popular coupons and discounts.JC Penney shares have advanced 44 per cent since the start of 2016.Elsewhere, the S&P 500 materials sectors rallied 1.4 per cent, outpacing the broader market, as the price of copper rose to the highest level of 2016.Freeport-McMoRan, a copper miner that has been pressured by low commodity prices, rallied 4.4 per cent to $7.43. The stock is still down by almost two-thirds over the past 12 months.Energy stocks also performed well on the back of a rise in the price of US crude oil.Transocean, which operates offshore oil rigs, jumped 5.1 per cent to $8.65. Meanwhile, exploration and production company Marathon Oil added 8.7 per cent to $8.03.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had retreated 0.2 per cent to 1,948, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.3 per cent to 16,639.9, and the Nasdaq Composite crept up 0.2 per cent to 4,590.5.Wall Street sentiment was given an earlier lift from data showing that the US economy capped 2015 on a stronger footing than initially thought, along with a separate report showing that the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge rose to the highest level in three years.Materials, energy and financials, all sectors that are seen as sensitive to the economy, made gains. Meanwhile, utilities, consumer staples and telecommunications, all defensive sectors, fell.
43;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-02-22T21:53:21Z;BHP Billiton slashes dividend as profits slide;;Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton axed its interim dividend by 74 per cent as it seeks to protect its credit rating amid a commodities slump that has chipped away at the company’s bottom line.BHP announced that it is adopting a dividend policy that provides a minimum 50 per cent payout of underlying attributable profit at every reporting period. The Board has now agreed to pay an interim dividend of 16 cents a share in the first half, from 62 cents a share.This brought an end to BHP’s commitment to a progressive payout policy, under which the company was to maintain or raise its dividend when it announced interim results, write Mamta Badkar, James Wilson and Jamie Smyth.Jac Nasser, chairman, said “we have not made these changes lightly” and noted:The changes to the dividend policy announced today reflect the Board’s assessment of the outlook for commodities and the increased financial flexibility this demand. While the continued development of emerging ecnomies will underpin longer-term demand growth for commodities, we now believe the period of weaker prices and higher volatility will be prolonged.Ratings agency Standard and Poor’s cut its rating on the miner to ‘A’ from ‘A+’ and put the ratings on creditwatch negative this month noting that it could downgrade BHP’s ratings after its earnings, depending on the announced dividend policy.A swoon in commodity prices has prompted some of the world’s largest miners, including Glencore, Freeport-McMoRan and Anglo American, to suspended dividend payments.The news came alongside a 92 per cent drop in underlying profits of $412m from continuing operations in the six months to the end of December, compared with $4.9bn in the year ago period. This widely missed analysts’ expectations for $727.2m.The miner reported a net loss for the first half of its financial year of $5.7bn compared with income of $4.3bn in the same period last year.A drop in the price of iron ore, copper and oil has weighed on the miner and prompted it to writedown more than $7bn pre-tax (or about $4.9bn after tax) on its US shale assets last month.BHP said it is implementing a company wide reorganisation and a management shake up. Iron ore boss Jimmy Wilson and oil head Tim Cutt are leaving. Mike Henry and Daniel Malchuk are handed wider operational responsibility over a suite of assets in Australia and the Americas respectively.“Slower growth in China and the disruption of OPEC have resulted in lower prices than expected,” said Andrew Mackenzie, BHP chief executive. He said the new dividend policy and transparent capital management framework were part of a strategy to manage volatility.BHP shares have also been pressured after its Samarco dam in Brazil burst last year leaving more than a dozen dead and polluting the nation’s second-largest river system.BHP’s shares in Australia have declined more than 40 per cent over the past 12 months.
44;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-02-22T16:37:59Z;Beaten up energy stocks lead US rally;;The energy and materials sectors led US equities sharply into the black on Monday on the back of a rise in the price of crude oil and industrial metals.The bounce in crude came amid hopes that the glut of crude supply may ebb as producers respond to low prices.The International Energy Agency said in a report on Monday that US shale production may fall over the next two years as oil producers scale back investment. Friday offered the latest evidence of the retrenchment as a survey showed the the number of US oil rigs had dropped to the lowest since December 2009.Saudi Arabia and Russia also said last week that they would agree to freeze oil output at current levels if other big producers agree to such a move.US crude oil prices rallied 7.1 per cent to $31.75 a barrel, having risen 21.9 per cent since hitting the lowest level since 2003 on February 11. Brent, the international benchmark, climbed 5.3 per cent to $34.77 a barrel.The advance pushed the S&P 500 energy index up 1.8 per cent. Among the companies posting large gains was Apache, an exploration and production company, which tacked on 5.2 per cent to $39.26. The shares are still down 40.7 per cent over the past 12 months.Chevron, one of the US oil makors, rallied 2.3 per cent to $88.51.Investors also pushed up mining stocks as the price of aluminium and copper logged solid gains. Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, said that industrial metals may be “putting in a bottom” after facing heavy losses over the past year amid concerns about the pace of global economic growth.Freeport-McMoRan, a copper miner, leapt 12.4 per cent to $7.78, cutting its 12-month decline to 62.3 per cent. Alcoa, an aluminium producer, rose 10.9 per cent to $8.73.

Levels below “BBB-” are considered to be speculative-grade, sometimes referred to as junk.

The mine produced around 400,000 tonnes of copper last year for Freeport and was the group’s largest single source of the metal.Freeport is the world’s largest listed producer of copper but its problems from the falling price of the metal have been compounded by controversial transactions four years ago to step up its exposure to oil and gas. The deals massively increased Freeport’s debt, leaving it more exposed as the commodity cycle has turned.The mining industry is being most affected by the economic slowdown in China, which became by far the largest source of commodities demand over the past decade. The slowdown has hit demand for minerals used in construction and industry.In a statement on Monday, Richard Adkerson, Freeport’s chief executive, said the deal with Sumitomo “represents an important initial step toward our objective to accelerate debt reduction and restore our balance sheet, while retaining a portfolio of high-quality assets and resources”.Indebted miners are trying to sell assets but are very reluctant to entertain offers for their best mines unless their financial circumstances become desperate. Larger miners such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton are hunting for copper acquisitions, which will boost growth once the cycle recovers, but will only consider those that are large, low-cost and in safe jurisdictions.Sam Walsh, Rio’s chief executive, last week said that assets so far offered for sale by distressed companies were “distressed for a reason”.Shares in Freeport have rebounded from lows a month ago but are still down almost three-quarters over the past 12 months.
47;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-02-01T18:33:23Z;BHP dividend policy puts it at risk of rating cut – S&P;;BHP Billiton could suffer another ratings downgrade if it does not abandon its so-called progressive dividend policy.The warning from Standard & Poor’s will add to speculation that the world’s biggest resources company by market value is preparing to cut its payment to shareholders, which last year cost more $6bn.Lowering its rating on BHP to ‘A’ from ‘A+’ on Monday, S&P said Anglo-Australian mining company could be cut another notch to ‘A-’ if it sticks with a pledge to keep continually raising its dividend, writes commodities editor Neil Hume.S&P said in a statement:If the company remains committed to its progressive dividend policy, while its cash flows are pressured by lower commodity prices, we could lower the ratings by another notch.At this stage, we have no certainty on the company’s response to the challenging market environment.BHP is due to file interim results on 23rd of February and many analysts think the company will cut its dividend and slash spending levels in order to bolster its financial position.BHP’s chairman Jac Nasser told investors at the company’s annual general meeting in November that the strength of the company’s balance sheet must be the main priority. That means keeping a solid A credit rating.A number of the world’s largest miners, including Glencore, Freeport-McMoRan and Anglo American, have already suspended dividend payments as they try to survive the downturn in prices.“BHP Billiton has the strongest credit rating in the sector and remains committed to maintaining its strong balance sheet through the cycle,” the company said in a statement.S&P said it had downgraded BHP and placed it on review for another downgrade because of falling commodities prices and the increasingly uncertain outlook for demand as China’s resource hungry economy slows. BHP is a large producer of iron ore, copper as well as oil and gas.

Same store sales, a key industry metric, fell 4 per cent in North America but were modestly better than expected.The retailer said revenues were boosted by its acquisition of Stuart Weitzman last year, with boots in particular selling well in the US, and a strong showing in Europe and mainland China.“We view the strength of Stuart Weitzman against a backdrop of unseasonably warm weather as impressive and see this business as adding stability to the model and a lever for growth over the long term,” Randal Konik, an analyst at Jefferies, said.This came alongside a 7 per cent decline in profits to $170.1m or 61 cents a share. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 68 cents per share topped forecasts.Coach also said it was raising its outlook for operating income, without specifying the amount, and maintained its revenue forecast for the year.The results “reflect the most significant progress to date on our transformation plan despite the difficult retail environment globally,” Victor Luis, chief executive, said. Mr Luis has tried to revive sales at the retailer, which has seen increased competition from brands like Michael Kors, even as years of heavy discounting hurt the brand’s image. The retailer’s shares fell nearly 13 per cent last year.Sprint shares advanced 18.7 per cent to $2.99 after the US mobile carrier reported a second consecutive quarterly net gain in customers.The Kansas-based company, which has sought to stem customer losses by engaging in a costly price war, reported a net gain of 366,000 of so-called “postpaid” phone users — those who are billed for their service on a recurring monthly basis — during the third quarter. That compares to the year ago quarter when it lost 205,000 of these customers.These efforts however ate into the company’s quarterly results, with Sprint reporting a 10 per cent drop in sales to $8.1bn, missing analysts’ forecasts. Net losses narrowed to $836m or 21 cents a share, from $2.4bn or 60 cents a share in the year ago period. Analysts had forecast a loss of 26 cents a share.Shares in Freeport-McMoRan advanced 6.6 per cent to $4.20 after the copper miner announced additional measures to reduce its debt and said it was in talks with “third parties regarding potential transactions”.Arizona-based Freeport said its loss widened to $4.1bn, or $3.47 a share, and sales fell nearly 28 per cent to $3.8bn as the ongoing slump in commodities took its toll on the company’s results. Adjusting for one-time items however, the company reported a profit of 7 cents a share.Shares in trucking company Swift Transportation jumped 21.1 per cent to $16.56 after it reported better than expected fourth-quarter earnings.Energy stocks led the way on the benchmark S&P 500 as crude prices rallied.By markets close, the S&P 500 gained 1.4 per cent to 1,903.63, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.8 per cent to 16,167.23 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.1 per cent to 4,567.67.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

Freeport said it was “actively engaged” in talks over possible deals, which could be sales or joint-venture arrangements.The US group on Tuesday announced a $12.2bn annual loss for 2015, almost all stemming from writedowns to the value of its oil and gas assets.Freeport placed a big bet on oil and gas in 2012 with two controversial energy deals worth $20bn, which pushed up its debt just ahead of the commodities downturn. The group has pledged to return its strategic focus to mining, with a spin-off of oil and gas under consideration.Freeport owns some of the world’s largest copper mines, and sales of its crown jewel assets would be of huge interest to larger miners with stronger balance sheets, including Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. Both are keen to expand in copper to secure assets ahead of any cyclical recovery.In spite of the downturn, however, few of the mining industry’s most attractive assets — those mines with the largest resources and lowest costs — have been put up for sale.$12.2bnFreeport-McMoRan’s annual loss for 2015A slowdown in the Chinese economy, the world’s largest commodity consumer, and plunging copper and oil prices sent Freeport shares down by more than two-thirds in 2015. Copper is down 30 per cent since the end of 2014 and crude is down 47 per cent.Capital spending cuts, a suspension of its dividend and the exit of chairman James Moffett have followed, while Carl Icahn, an activist investor, has also been pushing Freeport to trim expenses. Freeport also raised $2bn of equity during 2015.“We are facing serious challenges because of what is going on in the marketplace and the situation with our balance sheet,” Mr Adkerson acknowledged. “The situation has developed in a negative way very quickly and aggressively and we are responding to it.”The company’s loss for the quarter widened to $4.1bn, or $3.47 a share, from $2.9bn for the same quarter a year ago. This was Freeport’s fifth consecutive quarterly loss. Revenues sank to $3.8bn from $5.2bn.Freeport’s borrowings are relatively high, with net debt of 4.67 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, compared with a ratio of about 2.75 for the S&P 500 materials sector. Its net debt rose from $18.4bn at the end of 2014 to $20.2bn at the end of last year.

The company is also idling three deepwater drill ships.The spectre of a deeper slowdown in the Chinese economy, the world’s largest commodity consumer, sent Freeport shares down by more than two-thirds in 2015. Capex cuts, a suspension of its dividend and the exit of its chairman James Moffett have all followed. Carl Icahn, an activist investor, has also been pushing Freeport to trim expenses.In a statement, Freeport said “in response to further weakening in market conditions in fourth-quarter 2015 and early 2016, Freeport today announced additional initiatives to accelerate its debt reduction plans and is actively engaged in discussions with third parties regarding potential transactions.”Its loss for the quarter widened to $4.1bn, or $3.47 a share, from $2.9bn for the same quarter a year ago. This was Freeport’s fifth consecutive quarterly loss. Meanwhile, revenues sank to $3.8bn from $5.2bn.The miner’s borrowings are relatively high, with net debt of 4.67 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, compared with a ratio of about 2.75 for the S&P 500 materials sector. The company said in December that it had reached an agreement with lenders that would lift this ratio to 5.9 times in the first half of 2016.For those keeping score: Freeport is the second worst performing stock on the S&P 500 this year, with its shares down 42 per cent in 2016.Its shares bounced 5.8 per cent in pre-market trading.

The decline brought the sector’s 2016 loss to more than 14 per cent.Among the biggest decliners in the sector were oil exploration and production companies. Devon Energy tumbled 8.05 per cent to $21.59, while Murphy Oil lost 3.11 per cent to $15.87. Williams Companies, a large energy infrastructure company, dropped 6.4 per cent to $14.77, but eased by the close to finish 1.84 per cent down at $15.49. Chevron, one of the biggest US energy companies, fell 3.10 per cent to $78.98.Materials companies also struggled. Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, fell as much as 10.1 per cent to $3.59 a share — the lowest level in more than 15 years — but bounced back to close up 2.78 per cent at $4.07.Many large banks performed poorly on Wednesday amid growing concerns that global financial market turmoil could cause the US Federal Reserve to slow its plans for raising interest rates further this year. Banks favour higher rates since it boosts the return they can generate on loans.JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, fell 2.63 per cent to $55.51, Bank of America lost 3.86 per cent to $13.69 and Citigroup declined 3.46 per cent to $40.49.Twitter, the social media company, was another notable decliner at one stage, but its shares rebounded to close 4.13 per cent up at $17.38.The stock is trading well below its $26 initial public offering price from November 2013, and at a fraction of its lifetime high of $74.73 struck that year.Shares in Square, a mobile-payments company run by Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, recovered their losses to close up 0.21 per cent at $9.49.IBM also faced heavy selling after the technology company issued a downbeat profit outlook for 2016. It has struggled to offset declines in its legacy computing units as it shifts into the era of cloud computing. Its shares closed down 4.88 per cent at $121.86.Netflix, one of 2015’s high-fliers, came under pressure after the video streaming site posted disappointing US subscriber growth figures in its quarterly results released after the closing bell on Tuesday.

Jim Duffy, an analyst at Stifel, said the investment bank’s checks showed sales may be benefiting from “availability of ample clearance merchandise”, indicating higher sales could be coming at the expense of profit margins.Lululemon’s shares rallied 3.82 per cent to $56.82, cutting the 12-month loss to around 1.7 per cent.At the other end of the spectrum, Alcoa shares tumbled after the aluminium maker posted mixed fourth-quarter results after the closing bell on Monday.The company swung to a loss of $500m, from a profit of $159m in the same three-month period in 2014. The results included a $565m hit mainly due to plant closures and income tax charges.Sales slipped 17.8 per cent to $5.2bn, missing expectations of $5.3bn. Adjusted earnings per share clocked in at 4 cents a share, topping estimates by two cents.Alcoa’s shares tumbled 9 per cent, extending their fall over the past year to more than 55 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan, a large copper miner, also sold off, skidding 4.64 per cent to $4.11.The energy sector also dipped, reversing course after starting the day with a solid advance.The culprit was crude oil prices. Brent, the international crude benchmark, fell as low as $30.43 a barrel — the cheapest in more than 11 years — before rallying back to $32.38, only to retreat again to settle at $30.86, down 2.2 per cent on the day.US West Texas Intermediate briefly fell beneath the $30 milestone as it traded in a similar pattern.Marathon Oil, an exploration and production company, dropped 4.5 per cent to $9.19.Kinder Morgan, an energy infrastructure company, dropped 3.95 per cent to $13.60.Starbucks, the coffee chain, got a lift after it reaffirmed its commitment to the China market.Chief executive Howard Schultz said in a speech that “over time, it’s conceivable that China could become our largest market”.The shares rose 2.84 per cent to $59.46, extending a 12-month advance to around 45 per cent.Anthem said it expected adjusted earnings per share to exceed $10.80 this year, up from an estimated $10.16 last year.

This follows a 20 per cent decline on Monday, amid a sell-off in copper and after ratings agency Fitch axed the company’s credit rating.Meanwhile, Aluminium maker Alcoa was the third biggest decliner, with shares sliding 10 per cent to $7.19. The company said late Monday that it swung to a loss in the fourth-quarter on the back of income tax charges and sales that fell nearly 18 per cent. Adjusting for one-time items however Alcoa reported earnings per share that topped forecasts. Shares were up after the results however and did not appear to be the trigger for bearish sentiment today.But mining stocks have been roiled amid renewed concerns on China, the world’s largest commodity consumer, and weakness in the renminbi.The S&P 500 metals and mining industry index, which includes just Alcoa, Freeport Mc-Moran, Nucor and Newmont Mining fell for the ninth consecutive day and has declined more than 20 per cent in 2016.Matthew Korn, an analyst at Barlcays, explains just how China has thrown a spanner in the works for mining stocks:We’ve seen a more volatile, weaker [Chinese yuan] and continued PMI contraction combined with unclear, arguably contradictory policy measures that all suggest, as our economists put it, “China’s economic situation has become inherently unstable.”This does not suggest a good set-up for mining stocks – instead the prospect for calling a bottom appears to be pushed out yet again.With concerns mounting about global economic growth it is unclear when miners could see their fortunes change.

It also said it expected 2016 adjusted earnings of $5.50 to $5.70 a share, compared with analysts’ estimates of $5.67 a share.The shares dropped 5.46 per cent to $103.03.Under Armour came under pressure after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut the stock to “underweight” from “equal-weight”.The analysts said the sportswear company was “losing market share for the first time in three years in apparel, and more surprisingly, [average sales prices] are falling at an accelerating pace”.The shares slid 6.72 per cent to $69.96, cutting their 12-month gain to about 3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan dropped as copper prices sold off by more than 2 per cent. The company’s credit rating was cut by Fitch Ratings after the market closed on Friday to triple B minus, from triple B.The rating agency said the move reflected its view that the “commodity prices recovery will be prolonged”.Freeport is one of the world’s biggest copper miners and has taken a beating as the price of the industrial metal has fallen by more than a quarter in the past 12 months.Its shares fell 20.33 per cent to $4.31, extending their decline over the past year to 80 per cent.Many energy companies came under pressure amid a sharp decline in the price of crude oil. Marathon Oil, an exploration and production company, dropped 7.05 per cent to $9.62 a share.Meanwhile, Williams Companies, an energy infrastructure company, fell 7.98 per cent to $18.69.General Motors shares rose after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “neutral”.The investment bank said worries that the global automotive cycle had peaked after a blistering year for sales were “overstated in the near-term”.The US carmaker’s shares climbed 2.44 per cent to $30.25. They were down about 16 per cent over the past 12 months.By the close, the S&P 500 had nudged up to 1,923.42, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up around 0.3 per cent to 16,397.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was about 0.1 per cent down at 4,637.63.
56;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2016-01-11T17:53:52Z;Freeport-McMoRan tumbles amid copper decline;;It’s been a stunning fall for one of the world’s biggest copper miners. Freeport –McMoRan plunged close to 20 per cent on Monday, extending its 12-month collapse to 80 per cent.The rout has been driven by a sharp fall in the price of copper. The industrial metal has melted by more than a quarter of the past year and dropped 2 per cent on Monday alone.The sell-off in Freeport’s shares stripped the company of $1.2bn in market cap. The company’s market value was almost $40bn just two years ago, now it stands at roughly $5bn.Adding to Freeport’s woes, the company’s credit rating was also cut by Fitch Ratings after the market closed on Friday to “BBB-“ from BBB”. The ratings company said the move reflected its view that the “commodity prices recovery will be prolonged”.Fitch also noted Freeport’s earnings are very closely tied to commodity prices, which have been particularly volatile in recent months. It reckons a 10 cent per pound decline in copper prices could cut earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation by $475m over a 12-month period on average in 2016 and 2017.Freeport’s plunge comes amid a 1.6 per cent decline in the S&P 500 materials sector.

Las Vegas Sands dropped 9.1 per cent to $39.79.Also in the red on Thursday were so-called cyclical stocks, which tend to be sensitive to economic fluctuations. Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of heavy machinery, dropped 3.4 per cent to $63.94, a steeper fall than US markets more broadly.Metals miners suffered as the price of copper, a key industrial commodity, slumped 1.6 per cent, touching the lowest level since 2009. Freeport-McMoRan, a large copper miner, slid 9.2 per cent to $5.61.Elsewhere KB Home shares fell 14.8 per cent to $10.05 after the homebuilder reported disappointing fourth-quarter results.The Los Angeles-based company reported profits of $44.1m, or 43 cents a share, on sales of $985.8m. This was short of Wall Street estimates for earnings of 50 cents a share, on sales of $1.1bn.KB Home delivered 2,580 homes last quarter, up 16 per cent from a year ago, but chief executive Jeff Mezger said inclement weather and labour shortages in some markets had “tempered” deliveries and “ultimately impacted our profitability for the quarter”.Homebuilders came under pressure after the disappointing results and amid a broader market sell-off. DR Horton fell 4 per cent to $28.53, Lennar slid 4 per cent to $43.43, and PulteGroup dropped 4 per cent to $16.22.Meanwhile Walgreens Boots Alliance said its net earnings in the quarter to November 30 had been 30.5 per cent higher than in the same period in 2014.

58;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2015-12-28T16:54:50Z;Moffett departure closes turbulent year for Freeport;US copper and oil group hit by low commodity prices;James “Jim Bob” Moffett is stepping down as executive chairman of Freeport-McMoRan, capping a year of turmoil at the US copper and oil group after it came under fire from activist investor Carl Icahn and began to restructure in response to a savage commodity price slump.The departure of the resource industry veteran ends an era at Freeport and is the biggest change in its boardroom since Mr Icahn revealed he held an 8.5 per cent stake in August, when he called for a series of changes including lower spending and cuts to executive pay.It also comes with Freeport struggling with the consequences of its decision three years ago to reunite its copper business with oil assets including McMoRan Exploration, Mr Moffett’s company, as part of a $20bn expansion into energy.With both oil and copper prices under pressure, Freeport is now considering a spin-off or initial public offering of its oil and gas business. Freeport has suspended dividend payments — following other leading miners including Glencore and Anglo American — as it grapples with about $20bn of net debt.Shares in Freeport have lost more than two-thirds of their value this year.Freeport said Mr Moffett, executive chairman since 2003, would step down from its board as of December 31 and be replaced by Gerald Ford, the lead independent director on the board.“During his over 50-year career in the natural resource industry, Jim Bob has become an icon as an explorationist,” Mr Ford said in a statement.Mr Ford will be a non-executive chairman while Richard Adkerson remains as Freeport’s chief executive.Mr Moffett will hold a “chairman emeritus” title at Freeport and will still act as a consultant to the company, with an annual fee of $1.5m according to a regulatory filing.He will advise Freeport on its negotiations in Indonesia, where it wants an extension to its contract to mine at Grasberg, a huge copper and gold deposit.Mr Moffett was one of the founders of McMoRan, which takes its name from him and two colleagues. It first merged with Freeport in 1981 but split in the 1990s as the miner’s copper business grew.Many of Freeport’s investors were deeply unhappy when the company reunited with McMoRan in 2012 and also acquired Plains Exploration. At the time Mr Moffett was chief executive of McMoRan as well as being chairman of Freeport. He had previously been chief executive of Freeport from 1995 to 2003.Freeport had already shaken up its governance this year in response to Mr Icahn’s demands, cutting the number of directors from 16 to 11 and appointing two representatives of Mr Icahn to the board in October.At that time Mr Icahn expressed satisfaction with Freeport’s board “for adopting a number of our recommendations . . . I hope and believe that we will work with Freeport’s board to enhance value as we have done with so many others in the past”.Freeport has some of the largest copper mines in the world but is cutting production at some marginal mines after the price of the metal fell about 25 per cent during 2015.Shares in Freeport fell 7.5 per cent in early trading in New York on Monday.
59;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2015-12-10T17:16:28Z;Miner bond yields test new highs as copper and iron tumble;Debt investors cautious in face of protracted commodity slump;"Bond prices for mining companies rebounded from new lows on Thursday, as Glencore announced fresh measures to cut its outstanding debt pile in the face of tumbling prices for ores and metals.The bounce provided some respite after prices for debt issued by Anglo American and Vale reached fresh lows on Wednesday, as investors assessed the ability of mining and resource companies to weather a protracted slump.With the gap between onshore and offshore renminbi prices widening, and prices for copper and iron ore hitting multiyear lows, the state of Chinese demand for raw materials remains a principal concern.“There is a lot of fear in the market this is not a bottom for commodity prices,” said Wen Li, analyst at CreditSights.He also pointed to other fears hitting debt prices: some mutual funds will be forced to sell bonds which lose an investment-grade credit rating; if miners cannot raise sufficient equity they may be forced to raise debt secured against assets, reducing the value of existing unsecured debt.“At some point that is going to be economical,” Mr Li said.Bonds maturing in 2020 issued by Glencore, the miner and trading house, bounced from 80 to 84 cents on the dollar on Thursday following comments by the company at an investor day, although prices were still down on the week.The company is considering a bond issue early next year to test the market and demonstrate its ability to raise capital, according to people familiar with the situation.Anglo American euro debt maturing in 2020 traded at a 9 per cent yield early on Thursday, a small recovery from the 9.4 per cent high hit the day before. The debt has fallen in value by more than a fifth since it was issued at a 3.6 per cent coupon in May.Anglo has $5bn of loan debt and $15bn of bonds outstanding, almost $11bn of which must be refinanced in the next five years. The company on Tuesday announced the suspension of its dividend for 18 months and plans to shed two-thirds of its operations as it attempts to restructure.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said: “Anglo cannot tap the debt market at anywhere near a sustainable rate given its earnings power.” Plans to raise $4bn from asset disposals and cut the number of mining assets from 55 to 20 were “a critical step”.Other miners have also been hit in recent weeks by a fall in prices for copper and iron ore. Yields on five-year debt from Freeport-McMoRan, the largest listed copper miner, rebounded from a recent high of 13.1 per cent to an 11.5 per cent yield on Wednesday, following the suspension of its dividend.The yield on five-year US dollar debt for Vale hit 8.8 per cent on Wednesday, before recovering slightly later in the day. The Brazilian miner has $23bn of debt and loans outstanding, and has been placed at risk of a credit rating downgrade following an environmental disaster."
60;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

Net debt exceeds $20bn. The high levels of borrowing accumulated by several natural resources companies during the commodities boom have become one of the main concerns for investors in the sector, with falling prices leading to lower earnings to cover debt repayments.Freeport has been targeted by Carl Icahn, the activist investor, who took a stake of more than 8 per cent this year.The group’s debt was partly racked up through deals involving gas productions assets in 2012 that irked some investors. It is now considering whether to spin off its energy assets as part of a strategic review.Freeport is the third major miner after Anglo and Glencore to halt dividend payments since September. The price of copper, a key commodity for several natural resources companies, is down by about one-third over the past year.After cutting its dividend by about 80 per cent in March, Freeport is now stopping any payouts until further notice, a step that will save $240m annually.The group’s board “will review its financial policy on an ongoing basis and authorise cash returns to shareholders as market conditions improve”, said Freeport.In morning trading in New York, Freeport’s shares were up 8 per cent at $7.28.Freeport, which owns some of the world’s largest copper mines, did not say where it might consider sales of minority interests.However, it will completely shut the Sierrita mine in Arizona, deepening planned production cuts. Freeport had already announced an initial 50 per cent shutdown of Sierrita.The deeper cut will take another 45,000 tonnes of copper off the market, a fraction of Freeport’s 1.7m tonnes of annual output.In oil and gas, Freeport said it would bring eight wells on line this year and next that would allow it to cut cash production costs from $19 per barrel of oil equivalent to $15/boe.Freeport said its oil and gas cash flows “would substantially fund its capital expenditures” in 2017 based on a Brent crude price of $45/barrel.
62;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2015-12-03T17:42:48Z;Freeport-McMoRan suffers licence setback in Indonesia;Jakarta rules out quick decision on whether to extend group’s operating permit at key mine;Freeport-McMoRan has suffered a setback after a senior Indonesian minister said Jakarta would refuse to take a quick decision on whether to extend the US company’s operating licence at one of the world’s largest copper and gold mines.The statement by Luhut Panjaitan, co-ordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs, and one of president Joko Widodo’s closest aides, quashes Freeport’s hopes of rapidly clarifying the future of a key asset in Southeast Asia’s largest economy.Freeport’s Indonesian unit has been seeking reassurance from the government that its permit for the Grasberg copper and gold mine will be renewed beyond the current expiry date of 2021, even though local regulations say negotiations can only begin two years before the contract ends.“The government’s stance on this is very clear, we don’t want to extend this contract until 2019,” Mr Panjaitan told the Financial Times. “Why should we give them an extension today when we have to break our own regulation?”The comments appear to mark a sharp U-turn in Jakarta’s stance. Ahead of Mr Widodo’s state visit to the US in October, Freeport had published a statement suggesting it had “productive discussions” with the government and received “assurance” that its operations at the Grasberg mine would be extended beyond 2021.“We are pleased with the assurances from the government of Indonesia of legal and fiscal certainty and look forward to continuing our long term partnership and investment plans,” James Moffett, Freeport’s chairman, had said in a statement in October.Like other miners, Freeport, the world’s largest producer of copper, is contending with the worst commodity rout since the financial crisis.Mr Panjaitan said Freeport’s Indonesian unit, in which the Indonesian government has a 9.36 per cent stake, had failed to meet Jakarta’s requirements for selling more shares to the state.Jakarta had set a deadline of October 14 for the company to lay out proposals for a 10.6 per cent stake sale to the state.The ministry of state-owned enterprises has proposed that either miner Aneka Tambang or aluminium producer Inalum — both government-held entities — take the additional shares in Freeport’s Indonesian unit.“To superpowers, we have to tell them: look you are the ones who wanted to promote democracy in this country,” said Mr Panjaitan. “Now this country has become a very democratic country then you support us — respect our law.”Riza Pratama, a Freeport spokesman, said: “We can’t comment because we have no direct working relationship with Pak Luhut’s office.”Freeport, which discovered its first deposits in Indonesia in 1936, generated 8.4 per cent of its revenue last year from the country.The comments by Mr Panjaitan come against the background of a parliamentary investigation into Setya Novanto, the Speaker of Indonesia’s House of Representatives, following allegations last month that he attempted to extort a stake in Freeport’s Indonesian unit by demanding the company sell shares to Mr Widodo and vice-president Jusuf Kalla.Mr Novanto told local media last month his comments were made in jest, while Mr Kalla has denied any involvement in the matter. Mr Kalla also suggested Mr Widodo was angry about what had been said.The case is a further complication for Freeport in Indonesia, where new rules have banned the export of unprocessed minerals, forcing mining groups to build local smelters.
63;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2015-11-19T14:50:31Z;Indonesia launches probe into Freeport-McMoRan extortion claims;Top government official allegedly demanded stake in mining group;Indonesia has launched an investigation into alleged attempts by senior officials to extort a stake in Freeport-McMoRan’s Indonesian unit in return for an extension of the US mining company’s right to operate in the country.Sudirman Said, minister of energy and mineral resources, filed a complaint with the House of Representatives ethics committee this week alleging that the Speaker, Setya Novanto, demanded Freeport divest shares to President Joko Widodo and his vice-president, Jusuf Kalla.“We will wait and see how the house settles this,” Mr Kalla told local broadcaster Berita Satu, denying any involvement in the matter.When asked whether Mr Widodo had reacted to the allegations, he added: “Of course, anyone will get angry if their name is tagged.”Mr Widodo’s office did not respond to an emailed request for comment.Mr Novanto was in the spotlight earlier this year after he made an appearance at a campaign rally with Donald Trump in the US, commenting on Indonesians’ support for the presidential hopeful. His Golkar party, the main opposition, later apologised for the incident.The matter has raised fresh concerns around corruption in Southeast Asia’s largest economy and Mr Widodo’s weak leadership, just a year after he took the reins in Jakarta pledging to stamp out graft.With social media petitions for Mr Novanto’s resignation gaining traction, the Speaker told local media his comments were made in jest.The scandal may also add to uncertainty for Freeport as senior politicians push for an evaluation of the group’s operations in Indonesia. The mining group is already battling with weak commodity prices and Indonesia’s ban on the export of unprocessed minerals.“We can’t comment because the allegations are being investigated,” said Riza Pratama, Freeport’s spokesman.Freeport, which plans to invest between $16bn and $18bn in underground development, has been lobbying Jakarta for affirmation that its contract to work in Indonesia will be extended beyond 2021.The group generated 8.4 per cent of its revenue last year from Indonesia, according to Bloomberg, and had expressed hope over “productive discussions” with Jakarta ahead of Mr Widodo’s state visit to the US last month.Amid this week’s scandal, Luhut Panjaitan, co-ordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs, appeared to flip-flop on those reassurances.“The extension of the Freeport contract can only be completed through negotiation two years before the contract expires,” he said on Thursday, citing government regulation.“The divestment and development of a smelter were supposed to be completed by Freeport a while ago and the company has simply failed to fulfil those requirements.”The Indonesian government, which has a 9.4 per cent stake in Freeport Indonesia, had set a deadline of October 14 for the company to lay out proposals for a further 10.6 per cent stake sale as part of its investment agreement.“Clearly this is more about politics,” says Erwan Teguh, head of research at CIMB Securities in Jakarta.Freeport operates one of the world’s largest gold and copper mines in the remote eastern highlands of Papua, where the company has a history of deaths and strikes involving its workers and has been criticised for causing environmental damage.
64;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2015-11-12T23:05:59Z;Advance Auto Parts skids into red;Every US stocks sector in negative territory;Advance Auto Parts skidded into the red on Thursday after the company revealed weaker than expected quarterly results and its long-time chief executive stepped down.The Virginia-based company said third-quarter net profits dipped 1.4 per cent on a year-over-year basis to $120.5m. Excluding certain items, earnings came in at $1.95 a share, well below Wall Street estimates of $2.09. Sales edged higher by 0.3 per cent to $2.3bn, also shy of expectations of $2.33bn.Advance Auto, which sells after-market auto parts such as batteries and windshield wipers, said continuing demands from the integration of General Parts, a 2013 purchase, continued to weigh on results. It also took a hit from currency fluctuations. Meanwhile, chief executive Darren Jackson will step down after eight years at the company’s helm.Advance Auto also forged a pact with activist investor Starboard Value, which revealed a 3.7 per cent stake in the company in late September and has been pushing for “comprehensive operating improvements” and a “substantial” dividend or stock buyback programme.Starboard chief executive Jeffrey Smith will be given a seat on the board and made chair of its nominating and corporate governance committee. Investors sent the shares sinking 15.4 per cent to $164.67 by close of trading. Shares, however, are still up 3.4 per cent for the year.Elsewhere, department store chain Kohl’s revealed better than expected quarterly earnings amid an outperformance by its women’s clothing and footwear businesses.Sales rose 1.2 per cent from the prior year to $4.43bn, while net profits slid to $120m from $142m on the same basis. Adjusted profits of 75 cents a share topped the street view of 69 cents.The shares rallied 6.1 per cent to $45.80. The move came in stark contrast to the 14 per cent dive that Macy’s shares sustained on Wednesday on the back of disappointing quarterly results and a cut to its full-year sales outlook.Meanwhile, the materials and energy sectors faced heavy selling on the back of declines in the prices of several commodities.Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world’s biggest copper miners, dropped 5.8 per cent to $8.77 on the back of a 2.3 per cent fall in the price of copper.On the energy side, ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest publicly traded energy company, fell 2.7 per cent to $79.40. US crude oil futures were down 64 cents, or 1.5 per cent, to $42.30 a barrel.US stocks sustained broad-based selling by markets close. Every sector was in negative territory, while nearly 90 per cent of volume on the New York Stock Exchange was in declining shares.The move came as two Federal Reserve officials offered differing assessments on whether the central bank will be prepared to increase short-term interest rates from historic lows when it meets next month.While the labour market has shown continued signs of improvement recently, inflation has remained stubbornly below the Fed’s target.The broad S&P 500 slipped 1.4 per cent to 2,045.97, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.4 per cent to 17,448.07 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.2 per cent to 5,005.08.

The results cover a choppy period for the US real estate market.A measure of sales of newly constructed single-family homes from the commerce department rose 24.8 per cent in July from the year before, but the pace dipped to 2 per cent in September.Shares in DR Horton, the largest US homebuilder by sales, climbed 8.2 per cent to $31.14, bringing the year-to-date advance to 23 per cent.In the same sector, PulteGroup advanced 3.6 per cent to $18.19.Elsewhere, Gap came under pressure on the back of weaker October sales figures than expected and a disappointing profit outlook for the third quarter.The retailer’s troubles deepened in late September after Stefan Larsson, who had been credited with a turning round the lower-end Old Navy Brand, left to become the chief executive of Ralph Lauren.Gap slumped 1.4 per cent to $27.29, widening its retreat this year to 35 per cent.On the other side of the spectrum, Chipotle said 43 restaurants in the US Northwest would reopen after an outbreak of E. coli. Health authorities, which have yet to determine the cause, will oversee the reopenings.The chain — known for its burritos and guacamole — is testing fresh produce, raw meat and dairy items to ensure there is no contamination, and has deep-cleaned the restaurants and discarded all stock.Chipotle shares climbed 3.3 per cent to $629.51, helping cut this year’s loss to 8 per cent.In the healthcare sector, Valeant dropped after its chief executive warned of “significant” near-term risks to its dermatology division, which accounted for 16.7 per cent of third-quarter sales. The biotechnology company has been mired in controversy over decisions to raise prices on certain drugs and its relationship with a speciality pharmacy.The shares slid 2.1 per cent to $83.64 in volatile trading. They have collapsed by nearly 70 per cent since August.Another weak performer on the day was materials. Freeport-McMoRan, the big copper miner, slumped 6.2 per cent to $9.84, as the price of copper fell for a fourth day amid concerns about demand from China.Trade data released on Monday, and a reading on consumer-level inflation on Tuesday, came in below economists’ expectations.McDonald’s wavered in late-morning trading as investors eagerly awaited an investor meeting, which was set to begin later on Tuesday.

66;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2015-11-10T21:02:22Z;Activists to intensify pressure on boards;Investors expected to push harder on return of capital via share buy backs and dividends before rate rise;Activist investors will intensify their pressure on the boards of companies by pushing for strategic disposals and higher capital returns to shareholders ahead of a rate rise, according to a report from Moody’s.Companies including eBay, General Motors and Macy’s are being pushed by investors to spin-off underperforming businesses, buy back shares and lift dividends in a chase for greater returns before the Federal Reserve raises interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.At least 178 publicly announced campaigns have been launched by activist funds since the start of the year, according to the rating agency, a rise of 8 per cent on the same period in 2014 which was a record year for activist drives.Analysts projected that as many as 235 campaigns would be launched against non-financial groups by the end of 2015, to eclipse the record of 222 during 2014.“In recent years activists have become increasingly emboldened to go after larger quarry,” said Chris Plath, an analyst with Moody’s. “Hedge fund activists have been awash with cash as investors continue to chase yield in a low interest rate environment. Even the more traditionally secure targets have become fodder for activist agendas.”Activist targets have underperformed the broader US market, however, with an index calculated by Standard & Poor’s of companies targeted in the past 24 months down nearly 10 per cent year-to-date.Of the 69 companies on the index, share prices of about three-fifths have declined. By contrast, hedge fund performance is roughly flat for the year, according to HFR, the industry data provider.The surge in activist activity was fuelled by “too much capital chasing too few targets”, said Mr Plath, and investors were likely to double down on their efforts to spur better returns as the main US equity benchmark sits less than 1 per cent above where it started of the year.Rising level of shareholder resolutions at annual meetings provokes a reaction from the business lobbyRead moreJim Rossman, a Lazard managing director who advises companies on how to respond to activist investor campaigns, said activists had become an enduring part of the market.“As long as companies underperform there will be activists targeting them,” said Mr Rossman. “More importantly, with fewer large asset manager owning larger portions of S&P 500 companies, they have greater power to influence the way a company is run and being active has become more acceptable even for them. That’s what they believe their 401K investors want.”According to Lazard, on average 44.7 per cent of the equity of an S&P 500 company is owned by its top 10 institutional shareholders and index funds, such as BlackRock and Vanguard.Companies targeted by activists this year include some of the largest names in corporate America, including DuPont, which was locked in a dispute with Nelson Peltz’s Trian Group earlier this year.Food group ConAgra has found Jana Partners at its door, Carl Icahn targeted Freeport-McMoRan, American International Group and eBay, while Starboard Value has launched campaigns against Macy’s, Advance Auto Parts, Staples and Media General.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
67;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2015-11-09T18:13:34Z;Lonmin share issue confirms company’s fall from grace;The once muscular platinum miner is struggling with falling prices and expensive operations;"Back when Lonmin was a leading platinum producer in an effervescent mining sector, it felt muscular enough to give short shrift to an unwanted $10bn takeover offer.Xstrata’s £33-a-share offer was 42 per cent higher than Lonmin’s prevailing stock price — but was dismissed as “an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire Lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets”.That was 2008. To say that Xstrata’s offer looks generous with hindsight is to put it charitably.With Lonmin’s market capitalisation down to £120m, the South African miner on Monday launched a massively dilutive rights issue in which investors can buy 46 new shares for each share they own. The price: 1p per share, or a 94 per cent discount to Lonmin’s 16.25p stock price on the eve of the issue.As Lonmin shareholders ponder that choice — and as Investec analysts note, “management is effectively forcing shareholders to follow their rights or be diluted into obscurity” — they can reflect on a precipitous corporate fall from grace, even by mining’s cyclical standards.When still known as Lonrho, the colonial-era conglomerate sprawled across the business landscape far beyond Africa, snapping up assets and earning swashbuckling boss Tiny Rowland a censure from former British prime minister Edward Heath as “the unacceptable face of capitalism”.Post-Rowland, stripped of non-mining assets and renamed Lonmin, the company still seemed to be in the right place at the right time, with a healthy market capitalisation of $2.5bn in 2001 just as commodities were about to experience a decade-long boom.Now Lonmin is on its third rights issue since 2009, which it insists is necessary, along with associated bank refinancing, to keep the company in business.Across mining, the commodities downturn is forcing companies to tap investors for more equity. Glencore and Freeport-McMoRan have done so since September and Nyrstar, a zinc producer, also announced a rights issue on Monday.But Lonmin’s problems have been compounded by a costly and ineffective attempt to introduce more mechanised mining a decade ago, as well as the complexities of operating in South Africa, which has about 80 per cent of the world’s proven platinum reserves but is dogged by soaring costs and regulatory uncertainty.The company has been riven by labour unrest, reaching a nadir when 34 striking miners were shot by police at the company’s Marikana mine in 2012. A commission of inquiry criticised Lonmin for failing to respond appropriately to the threat of, and the outbreak of, violence.Some analysts are ready to write the company off completely. “I will be amazed if Lonmin is still trading in five years’ time,” says Paul Gait, analyst at Bernstein Research.Ben Magara, chief executive, says such doubts are misplaced. “The possibility of ceasing trading …I think the announcement kills that fire properly,” he said on Monday. “This is a fully underwritten rights issue, the amended [loan] facilities have been agreed by all the banks, so we are on the right footing.”The rights issue seeks to raise a net $369m to pay for some capital spending and lay-offs, as well as to cut Lonmin’s net debt, which stood at $185m at September 30.Lonmin’s problems start with slumping prices for its output, leading to its underlying pre-tax loss of $143m in its 2015 financial year. The “basket price” for the platinum and associated metals that the company produces has fallen by 34 per cent since 2011, from almost $1,300 per ounce to $849/oz this year.Platinum demand is fed mainly by its use in making catalytic converters for diesel-powered vehicles, in jewellery; and as an investment. In all three cases, “demand is suffering and is likely to be constrained for a couple of years”, says Ben Davis, analyst at Liberum. The latest question mark over demand is the emissions scandal at Volkswagen, which could “cement diesel’s decline”, add the analysts.Given weak demand, aggressive supply cuts would be an obvious answer. But the platinum industry is built around deep mining shafts where closures are expensive and difficult to reverse, while labour militancy and political sensitivities in South Africa make redundancies complex.The Marikana tragedy created fertile terrain for the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, a militant upstart that led last year’s unprecedented five-month strike at Lonmin and its two larger rivals, Anglo American Platinum and Impala Platinum.While Lonmin plans 6,000 redundancies, the impact of more job losses would be difficult for the country to swallow. As Mr Magara said on Monday, jobs at Lonmin directly and indirectly support about 300,000 South Africans.Lonmin and other South African miners are struggling with double-digit increases in labour and energy costs and for many investors in and outside the country, its mining sector is best avoided.South African miner at mercy of metals prices and social issues as it scrambles into rights issue, writes Jonathan Guthrie.Full story“We are a very unattractive investment environment, the government’s policy has been hostile,” says one South African mining veteran. “It is a really difficult situation for mining companies.”Mr Gait predicts the platinum industry will migrate towards lower-cost, open-pit mines such as Amplats’ Mogolakwena, still able to generate strong profit margins. That will render deep-level operations such as Lonmin’s anachronistic, he adds.A successful Lonmin rights issue, say many analysts, will simply delay the day of reckoning.“For the platinum sector to recover, marginal supply like Lonmin must be rationalised,” says Mr Davis. “With capital markets and the South African government failing to let it happen, it will only prolong the pain.”1999: Lonrho conglomerate renamed Lonmin after break-up and focuses on platinum mining2006 to 2008: Lonmin attempts to mechanise labour-intensive mines but abandons the idea in spite of investing heavilyAugust 2008: Xstrata makes £33-a-share offer for Lonmin and acquires 10.7 per cent stakeOctober 2008: Xstrata offer lapses but stake in Lonmin is increased to 24.5 per centMay 2009: Lonmin launches $457m rights issue after platinum demand falls in financial crisisAugust 2012: Police shoot and kill 34 striking Lonmin miners in what becomes known as the “Marikana massacre”November 2012: Lonmin seeks to recover post-Marikana.

The Fed indicated this week that a rate rise remained a possibility in December.“It will be interesting to see if the sector will be able to maintain this momentum going into November, because if the Fed hikes and this is accompanied by dollar strength it will be a headwind for the group,” Mr Koesterich added.LinkedIn shares jumped 11 per cent to $240.87 by the close after better than expected third-quarter results accompanied an upbeat sales outlook. The professional networking site revealed adjusted earnings of 78 cents a share, ahead of forecasts for 45 cents. Sales rose 37 per cent to $780m, above expectations for $756.4m.Current quarter sales were expected to be $845m to $850m, compared with Wall Street estimates of $846.7m.Shares in SolarCity declined 22 per cent to $29.65 after the rooftop solar power company reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss and issued a disappointing outlook.SolarCity reported a net loss of $19m, or 20 cents a share, in the three months that ended in September, compared with a profit of $19.2m, or 21 cents, in the period a year ago. Sales nearly doubled to $113.9m.For the current quarter SolarCity projects a loss in the range of $2.60 to $2.75 a share, wider than analysts’ expectations for $2.05 a share.Valeant fell 15.9 per cent to $93.7 after it said it was severing ties with a so-called speciality pharmacy group.The Canadian drugmaker’s relationship with Philidor has been scrutinised in recent weeks after a short seller alleged in a research note that the pharmacy was part of an accounting fraud designed to inflate Valeant’s sales.US stocks struggled, with the S&P 500 sliding 0.48 per cent to 2,079.36.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.52 per cent at 17,663.54, and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.40 per cent lower at 5,053.75.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

The Kenilworth, New Jersey-based company is conducting a large, late-stage trial for Anacetrapib, a drug that uses a similar mechanism to Evacetrapib. Analysts are expecting sales of $567.2m for the Merck drug in 2019, and $858.6m the following year, according to a poll by Bloomberg.Jeffrey Loo, equity healthcare research analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said the news from Lilly “raises more uncertainty” about Merck’s drug, but “doesn’t necessarily mean [it] won’t be efficacious”.Eli Lilly shares shed 8 per cent at $79.45 by the close of trading.On the other side of the spectrum, companies that were recently approved for new cholesterol drugs climbed on the day. Amgen, which gained US Food and Drug Administration approval for a drug called Repatha in August, climbed 2 per cent to $153.03. Meanwhile, Regeneron, which in partnership with Sanofi scored a green light from the FDA for Praluent in July, rallied 4.6 per cent to $526.83.Mr Loo said both of those drugs are aimed at lowering “bad” cholesterol among people who do not respond well to so-called statins, such as Lipitor.Elsewhere, Phillips 66 said its board approved an increase in its stock buyback of $2bn, bringing the total authorisation to $9bn. The Houston-based oil refiner also unveiled a $3.6bn capital budget for next year, excluding its Philips 66 Partners’ capital programme.Of those capital expenditures, $2bn will go to the midstream business, which includes the continued construction of a liquefied petroleum gas export terminal on the Gulf Coast. It is also investing in pipeline projects to move crude oil from North Dakota’s Bakken region to market centres across the US.Meanwhile, $1.2bn will be invested in the company’s refining business, with 70 per cent of that sum heading to safety and environmental initiatives.By close, the shares were up 0.4 per cent to $83.87.The US energy sector as a whole dropped after its best week of 2015 amid a decline in the price of crude oil. Chevron, an oil major, fell 1 per cent to $88.75. Marathon Oil, which is a big performer in the shale arena, dipped 3 per cent to $18.96.Freeport-McMoRan, the mining heavyweight, saw its shares dip 4 per cent to $12.94. The move came after a 27 per cent surge last week on news the company might spin off its oil and gas division.Shares of US airlines flew higher on the day. American Airlines rose 3.4 per cent to $43.84, Delta Air Lines climbed 2.7 per cent to $48.49, Southwest Airlines ticked up 3.2 per cent to $41.22 and United Airlines jumped 3.8 per cent to $57.80.Fiat Chrysler shares traded in New York climbed 1.5 per cent to $15.91. The carmaker said late on Friday that it planned to raise nearly $1bn as it spins off a 9 per cent stake of Ferrari in an initial public offering.By close, the S&P 500 added 0.1 per cent to 2,017.46, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 17,131.86 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.2 per cent to 4,838.64.

Even despite cheaper fuel and higher margins, analysts and investors are concerned that competition could erode profits back to unsustainable levels.Shares in United Continental Holdings, which have fallen 17 per cent this year, rose 6.6 per cent to 55.71 on Friday. American climbed 6.7 per cent to 42.42.Competitors were also lifted: Jet Blue rose 3.3 per cent to $26.10, Delta gained 2.7 per cent to $47.21, and Spirit Airlines advanced 4.1 per cent to $50.80.Electric carmaker Tesla slipped after its second analyst downgrade this week.Barclays cut its rating from “equal weight” to “underweight” and lowered its price target 5 per cent to $180 — among the lowest on Wall Street. The analyst bear camp on Tesla climbed to six; the stock still has nine “buy” ratings and eight “holds”.Tesla’s Model X, with falcon wings that open almost vertically and three rows of seats, launched with cheers from potential customers. But the vehicle should provide “a reality check on margins”, said Brian Johnson, analyst at Barclays.The X is expected to create a production headache, with Tesla making only about 5,000 deliveries in its fourth full quarter of production.The model is also expected to hit future deliveries and could slow production of its Model S cars, which could cause Tesla to miss full-year delivery forecasts.Shares of Tesla fell 2.7 per cent on Friday to $220.68 and are in the red by 1.3 per cent for the year.A sharp rally in the zinc price sparked a rally for producers of the metal. Zinc was up 10 per cent to $1,842 a tonne after Glencore said it would slash production by a third, which would reduce global production by about 4 per cent, according to Reuters.Teck Resources climbed 2.1 per cent to $7.46 and Freeport-McMoRan rose 0.2 per cent to $13.48. Teck should benefit from the “positive catalyst of reduced zinc output by the largest miner and trader of the metal”, wrote FBR Securities in a note.For every $0.10-per-pound change in zinc prices, the group’s earning should move 7 per cent, analysts said.Stocks on Wall Street were slightly higher on Friday with the benchmark S&P 500 closed the first full week of the fourth quarter with a gain of more than 3.2 per cent — its best week since December 2014.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both rose 0.1 per cent, to 2,014.89 and 17,084.49 respectively.

Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont has been under pressure from Nelson Peltz, the leader of activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management, to turn round its performance. Mr Peltz failed in a push earlier this year to secure a seat on the company’s board of directors.The blue-chip chemical company also cut its full-year earnings guidance as a result of a stronger dollar and tougher conditions in its agriculture unit. DuPont now expects full-year earnings of $2.75 a share, down from a previous outlook of $3.10.DuPont’s revenues fell 11 per cent in the second quarter from the year before, while operating earnings per-share ticked up 1 per cent on the same basis.The shares climbed 7.7 per cent to $55.23, cutting the year-to-date loss to about 25 per cent.Elsewhere, Freeport-McMoRan shares rallied 6 per cent to $11.85 after the company revealed plans to explore strategic alternatives for its oil and gas business. The company, which also cut the size of its board of directors, said it was considering a potential spin-off, joint venture or more cost cuts. A previously announced strategy to sell a minority stake in the oil and gas segment in a public offering also remains on the table.Phoenix, Arizona-based Freeport-McMoRan is one of the world’s biggest copper producers, but generated about 20 per cent of its overall revenue from its oil and gas business in 2014. Its shares have collapsed by half this year amid the swoon in commodity prices.Skyworks Solutions saw its shares dip 1.4 per cent to $80.71. The semiconductor company, which makes chips for Apple, said late Monday it would buy PMC-Sierra for roughly $2bn in cash. The transaction valued PMC at $10.50 a share, a 36.5 per cent premium to the company’s closing price before the deal was announced.Microsoft shares ticked up by 12 cents to $46.75 after the software group took the wraps off a duo of new smartphones. The company also updated its Surface tablet and Band fitness tracker.The healthcare segment was the biggest laggard of the major S&P 500 sectors. The losses were led by a sell-off in the biotechnology segment.Illumina faced some of the steepest losses on the closely tracked Nasdaq biotechnology index, tumbling 10.6 per cent to $145.81. The pharmaceutical company disclosed after the bell on Monday a full-year sales outlook that missed Wall Street forecasts.On the other side of the spectrum, energy shares were lifted by a rally in the price of brent crude oil. Transocean, one of the biggest offshore drilling contractors, jumped 7.3 per cent to $15.76. Oil majors advanced as well: ExxonMobil rose 1.4 per cent to $77.89, while Chevron jumped 3.5 per cent to $87.By close, the S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent to 1,979.92.

Sales rose 21 per cent to $1.2bn.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 28 cents a share, on sales of $1.2bn. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 54 cents a share also topped expectations.Third-quarter results were buoyed by growth in subscribers to its cloud services. New creative cloud subscriptions grew by 684,000, ahead of estimates.Shares of Adobe rose as much as 5 per cent before paring back gains to 1.2 per cent to $81.25 by the close of trading. The share price had slipped in after-hours trading on Thursday immediately after the company announced results, in response to a disappointing outlook. Adobe said it expects fourth quarter sales in the range of $1.28 to $1.33bn, shy of Wall Street’s estimates for $1.36bn.Adjusting for one-time items, the company expects earnings to range between 56 and 62 cents a share, also below forecasts for 64 cents.Analysts pointed out that sales growth is being impacted by the transition to the cloud in its digital media business.“While investors may harbour some concerns around a fourth-quarter revenue guide that came in about $60m light of consensus expectations and the departure of a key executive, strong performance against the above factors leads us to believe the core story remains firmly on track,” Keith Weiss, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said.Freeport-McMoRan was the worst performing stock on the benchmark S&P 500 after the copper miner said it was looking to sell $1bn in new shares.The news followed a similar share offering announced last month, which Freeport said it had completed.In a regulatory filing, the company said that it may offer shares “from time to time through designated sales agents”. Freeport shares fell nearly 11 per cent to $10.74.Shares in La Quinta Holdings fell 15.4 per cent to $16.05 after the hotel chain reduced its guidance and said its chief executive was stepping down.The Texas-based company now expects 2015 adjusted earnings in the range of $393m to $400m, below a previous forecast for $398m to $404m. Revenue per available room, a key industry metric, is now projected to rise between 3.5 to 4.5 per cent for the full-year, compared with its prior outlook for 4.5 to 5.5 per cent growth.The stock was also downgraded to “neutral” from “overweight” by analysts at JPMorgan, with the price target cut to $20 from $28.Gold was one of the few asset classes to benefit from the Federal Reserve’s decision to leave its rate unchanged.New York shares of Kinross Gold rose 9.5 per cent to $1.85, while Eldorado Gold added 4.8 per cent to $3.17 and Gold Fields Limited gained 3.1 per cent to $2.88.US markets closed down, continuing Thursday’s losses on the Fed decision.

Copper rose as much as 1.5 per cent to $5,434.50, but was later trading at $5,364 a tonne, up 0.2 per cent.Copper has jumped this week as more miners mothball operations at lossmaking mines, tightening the market for the metal that had fallen 16 per cent in 2015.Glencore’s dramatic decision to cut 400,000 tones of copper production over the next 18 months at two mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia comes in the wake of closures or cutbacks at mines controlled by Freeport-McMoRan, Asarco and Ok Tedi.Shortly after Glencore’s announcement on Monday, the Chinese operator of the Baluba mine in Zambia said it was suspending operations and cutting jobs because of falling prices and problems with power supply.“These announcements underline the fragility in copper mine supply and the extent of cost pressure at today’s prices,” said analysts at Macquarie in a report. “We cannot rule out more cutbacks.”Following grim trade data, China’s Ministry of Finance posted an article on its website earlier this week stating it would carry out “stronger proactive fiscal policy” to counter headwinds to economic growth.China accounts for more than 40 per cent of the metal’s global consumption. Copper prices have fallen almost 15 per cent this year, sliding to a six-year low of below $5,000 a tonne last month on fears that China’s economy could slow further.With short-selling of China’s equity markets largely barred by the government, copper has also become a proxy for those wanting to bet against the country’s economy due to its widespread use in construction and industry. Miners have said hedge funds are short-selling the metal and that demand for the metal is still robust, even if it is not growing as quickly as some had hoped.“We have seen an increase in order book for the second half of this year, across bulk commodities and metals,” Ivan Glasenberg, the chief executive of Glencore, said in an interview the Financial Times earlier this week.However, not everyone shares Mr Glansenberg’s view. Goldman Sachs believes the copper price will fall a further 18 per cent by the end of 2016 and remain below $4,500 a tonne through until 2018.“Fully-drawn credit, a heavily saturated property market and China’s recent bid for metal independence all pose risks to China’s future copper demand,” said Goldman analyst Andrew Quall in a report. The bank also sees 3m tonnes of new supply entering the market by 2020.The closures announced by Glencore and others follow a high level of production outages across the copper industry this year because of bad weather and labour disputes. This is helping to tighten the difference between supply and demand.“Glencore’s supply cutback alone is unlikely to push the market close to deficit this year,” said Daniel Haynes, commodities strategist at ANZ. “However, when combined with the already above-average level of unplanned disruptions, the copper market should be significantly tighter than originally forecast.”Glencore’s decision to mothball its African mines follows a similar move in coal. Earlier this year the Swiss-based company cut production from its mainly thermal coal mines in Australia, a move that has helped keep the price of the raw material, which is used in power generation, steady at about $50 a tonne.“We felt the world was oversupplied in coal so we cut production. And it’s had a very positive effect,” said Mr Glasenberg. “The one commodity that hasn’t reduced in price this year is thermal coal from Newcastle. Our strategy of supply discipline makes sense.”

It is the world’s largest listed copper producer.Freeport said it welcomed “constructive input towards our common goal of enhancing shareholder value” and added that its spending cuts were the results of a previously announced review of operating plans, suggesting they had not been announced in response to Mr Icahn’s stakebuilding.It added that the cuts would “strengthen our financial position during a period of weak and uncertain markets and preserve our large resource base for improved future market conditions”.Its shares closed 29 per cent higher at $10.19, but they are still 72 per cent below their level of a year ago.The company is cutting its planned capital expenditure for next year by almost 30 per cent, in a move that will curb its copper production, and will also cut its US workforce by 10 per cent to reduce operating costs.Freeport is one of the global resources groups being most tested by steep falls in commodity prices, which have hit the group at a time when it had racked up substantial debt with a big push into oil and gas via $20bn of acquisitions in 2012.Global miners are grappling with reduced demand from China, the most important market for many industrial commodities, as well as supply gluts in certain areas, including copper, iron ore and oil.Freeport said it “must respond aggressively to current market conditions by deferring investments and adjusting operations to maximise current cash flow”.The group said it would look at capital spending of $4bn in 2016, compared with a plan of $5.6bn announced just one month ago. The spending for next year will be split equally between its mining and oil and gas operations.Freeport cut its spending on oil and gas after the crude price rout that began last year, and it is now reducing investment on copper after the slide in the red metal’s value.The group said the benchmark copper price had fallen from an average of $3.11 per pound last year to a six-year low of $2.25 per pound.Freeport expects its 2016 and 2017 copper production to be about 150m lbs lower than estimated, mainly because of reduced activity at several mines in the Americas. It now anticipates copper sales in 2016 to reach 5.25bn lbs, compared with 5.4bn lbs previously.Mining will be suspended at Freeport’s facility in Arizona, while output will be halved at Tyrone in New Mexico and at El Abra in Chile.Last month, Freeport said it was considering curbing copper output, the first red metal producer to publicly countenance such a step.Freeport is looking to raise up to $1bn in equity to strengthen its balance sheet, and has said it will look at an initial public offering of a minority stake in its oil and gas subsidiary.This year Freeport’s operating cash flow is expected to be about $3.1bn, far short of its planned capital spending of $6.3bn.Next year Freeport said the situation should reverse, with $6.3bn of operating cash flow, compared to $4bn of capital spending.

If a miner’s shares are worth less than it would cost to replace its assets, value hunters will start sniffing around.And that looks like the case now. Capital spending in the mining sector has slowed. Projects are expensive to build, given declining metals prices. So it could prove cheaper for them to buy their rivals. That would please investment bankers — deals in the mining sector have fallen two-thirds since 2011.Consider copper, a key industrial base metal and one that diversified miners such as Glencore and Rio Tinto favour. To build a copper mine from scratch should cost about $20,000 a tonne of annual production, thinks Bernstein. Copper trades at about a quarter of that.Better to shop for assets on the stock market. Share prices for some copper miners have fallen so much that the buy versus build comparison is worth making. Antofagasta, the UK-listed Chilean copper producer, has nearly halved in value since 2012. If one were to buy it today, it would cost $17,000 a tonne of annual production — cheaper than building that production from scratch.Even Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest listed copper producer, trades at an enterprise value of just $24,000 a tonne of copper. That ignores Freeport’s gold and molybdenum operations, and its oil business.Not all miners are priced at giveaway asset valuations. Yet, if their share prices keep falling, that time will come soon.

I’m flabbergasted by the move today.”Trading activity soared in New York as markets whipsawed — more than 8.6bn shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, the third busiest trading day of the year.Equity volatility as gauged by the CBOE’s Vix index, a measure of the expected moves in the S&P 500 over the coming month, rose as high as 19.2 in early morning trading, before retreating 4.7 per cent to 16.2. Vix readings above 20 in the past have indicated an escalation of investor worry.Utilities led the benchmark index, with the S&P 500 utility index rising 2.5 per cent, buoyed by a 3.3 per cent rise from Duke Energy to $75.27. Public Service Enterprise Group climbed 3.3 per cent to $41.64 while PPL, an electricity provider in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee, gained 3 per cent to $30.93.Often viewed as a proxy for bonds, utilities — which carry high debt loads, are among the most correlated to interest rate moves and offer above average dividend yields — have rallied as turmoil in the Eurozone and China lapped volatility higher.That unease has weighed on trader expectations of when the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates — a major headwind for the sector. Federal Funds futures now imply the US central bank will not lift rates until March 2016.The material sector was the only industry to remain in negative territory after the late-day rally, as investors took fright at turmoil in Chinese equities and gold and copper prices slid.Newmont Mining Corp, the gold producer, was the steepest faller on the S&P 500, sliding 6 per cent to $22.41, while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper and gold producer, dropped 3.3 per cent to $17.25, adding to Monday’s 3 per cent decline.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices dropped 15.4 per cent to $2.09 after it warned on sales and cut guidance after the market close yesterday.

77;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2015-06-25T14:10:20Z;Freeport-McMoRan: dealmageddon;A spectacular demonstration of how big acquisitions can destroy value;We all know that acquisitions often destroy value. How to prove it, though? It is notoriously hard to argue a counterfactual. Any number of things might have happened had the deal not been done. Congratulations to Freeport-McMoRan, then, for demonstrating the point with spectacular certainty.This week, the commodities conglomerate filed an IPO prospectus for its oil and gas subsidiary. The offering will unwind its foray into hydrocarbon exploration. Freeport, then a copper and gold miner, spent $19bn in 2012 buying two oil and gas explorers: its former affiliate McMoRan Exploration, and Plains Exploration and Production. After Freeport made its case for the deal to investors, one of them captured the general mood by remarking: “Congratulations on one of the worst teleconferences I’ve ever heard to justify a deal”.Freeport shares dropped by a fifth that day, and that was before the crash in commodity prices. The group recently slashed its dividend and capital spending to conserve cash. It has net debt of $19bn against a market capitalisation of $21bn.The 2012 deals prompted litigation, too. Freeport’s chief executive and other members of the board were big shareholders in the struggling McMoRan. Plains also happened to be McMoRan’s largest shareholder. Shareholder lawsuits alleged Freeport bought Plains simply to ensure support for a rescue of McMoRan. Freeport and its banker Credit Suisse settled the complaints for over $150m.Freeport management argues that a separate listing will result in a better valuation for the energy unit, allowing it to raise capital more cheaply. If oil is about to enjoy a long rally, a separate listing may be savvy. But the IPO is an admission that it never made sense to conjoin mining and oil and gas production.Freeport management is not chastened. The new company, Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas, will have a dual-class share structure. Freeport will retain the super-voting shares, ensuring that it maintains complete control of a company that it never should have owned at all.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

BHP Billiton is on the verge of spinning off unwanted assets into a new listed company, while Vale of Brazil is also considering an IPO of its base metals business.Freeport on Thursday announced a $2.5bn quarterly loss for the three months to March 31, primarily because of impairment charges on oil and gas assets and deferred tax arrangements.The first-quarter loss, which compares with $510m of net income in the same period a year ago, comes after Freeport slashed its dividend by more than 80 per cent in March. The company also posted a $2.9bn quarterly loss for the last three months of 2014.Freeport spent heavily to bulk up its oil and gas business with two big acquisitions for a combined $20bn in 2012. Freeport had been vowing to cut its debt load last year, and made some divestments, before admitting that its targets were unachievable given the weakness in copper and oil markets.Total net debt stood at almost $20bn at the end of March, Freeport said, slightly higher than at the same time a year earlier.Freeport vies with Chilean state-owned miner Codelco as the world’s largest copper producer, with operations in Africa, the Americas and Indonesia.Revenue for the three months to March 31 came to $4.2bn, down from $5bn in the same period a year earlier, although Freeport’s copper and gold output increased.The average sales price during the quarter for Freeport’s copper was 13 per cent lower than a year earlier. Gold was 9 per cent lower.On the oil and gas side, Freeport’s cash operating margin — its revenues less its cash production costs — more than halved.

In a filing with US regulators, however, Whiting said the company was not “pursuing any significant strategic transaction at this time”.The news came alongside plans to sell 35m new shares and raise $1.75bn in convertible bonds.Chesapeake Energy was given a boost after the company cut its budget further. The Oklahoma City-based company cut its 2015 capital budget by $500m to a range of $3.5bn to $4bn on Monday, amid the drop in crude prices.Chesapeake had already lowered its budget for capital expenditures by more than a fifth from a year earlier, expecting in February to spend between $4bn and $4.5bn this year.In 2014, the company’s capital expenses before acquisitions totalled $5.8bn.The company said it would also lower its rig count 55 per cent from a year earlier to between 25 to 35.

As we talk to institutional clients, they’re highly convicted that with quantitative easing, Europe and Japan are a much easier bet than the US is.”The S&P 500 slid 1.7 per cent to 2,044.16 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.9 per cent to 17,662.94.

That compared with a profit of $707m or 68 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Sales fell 11 per cent from a year earlier to $5.23bn.Adjusted earnings of 25 cents a share fell short of Wall Street forecasts for 35 cents a share. The company took a $3.1bn charge in the quarter tied to a goodwill impairment of its oil and gas assets.Freeport and other materials and energy companies have fallen as copper hovers near five-year lows and as oil prices have more than halved from a 2014 high.The company said fourth-quarter consolidated copper sales of 972m pounds were lower than the 1.14bn sales it reported in the same period a year ago.“As we enter 2015, we are implementing a series of initiatives to reduce capital and operating costs to maintain financial strength during a period of weaker commodity prices while preserving a strong resource position and a portfolio of assets with attractive long-term growth prospects,” the company said.Freeport now expects its capital expenses to decline to $6bn in 2015, driven by a 34 per cent cut in oil and gas spending. It has also initiated efforts to secure third-party funding for a “significant portion of its oil and gas expenditures”.Shares of Freeport-McMoRan fell 6 per cent to $18.38 and are down 44 per cent in the past year.

Revenues advanced 8 per cent to $26.5bn.The quarter’s results included $243m of integration and restructuring expenses, or roughly 2 cents per share, as well as a 4 cent negative impact relating to an IRS audit adjustment. Adjusting for those items, Microsoft earned 77 cents a share, 2 cents ahead of forecasts.“Underlying trends in Windows and Office suggest a more challenging transition ahead, at least through our fiscal 2016 time horizon, likely exacerbated by tougher comparisons for the next two — three quarters that benefited from the PC refresh cycle associated with the end of support for Windows XP,” Rick Sherlund, an analyst with Nomura, said.Investors sold off positions in the tech sector following Microsoft’s results.

Shares of Freeport fell nearly 11 per cent to $18.74 and are down 48 per cent so far this year.While Wednesday’s sell-off was tied to the decline in copper prices, Nomura analysts said they were surprised that the company’s stock had been tracking crude prices in the last six months. The company was also “highly levered to oil and gas prices through its producing assets in the Gulf of Mexico and California”, analysts at Nomura said.Alcoa shares fell 5 per cent to $14.95, shares of Nucor Corp fell 3 per cent to $44.41 and shares of Allegheny Technologies fell 5 per cent to $28.52 amid the slump in materials stocks.Speaking at the Automotive News World Congress on Tuesday, Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk said demand in China was slowing, as sales were affected by concerns about too few chargers, pushing Tesla shares nearly 6 per cent lower to $192.69.“We believe this is a short-term challenge which should be resolved as Tesla builds out its supercharger network (there are currently around 32 supercharger stations in China) and continues to establish brand value in China,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird, said.

83;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2014-11-11T16:23:26Z;Oil slump drives surge in energy bonds;Companies look to refinance existing debt obligations;A slew of energy companies have come to the US debt capital markets in the past couple of days in spite of a rise in borrowing costs, seeking to refinance or pay off existing debt amid a slump in oil prices.Almost $17bn in energy debt has been sold in the US since the start of the November, according Dealogic. This week alone Chevron offered $4bn in six-tranches on Monday to repay commercial paper, while energy and mining company Freeport-McMoRan sold $3bn in bonds in part to refinance existing debt, according to S&P LCD data.Last week almost $10bn of energy bonds were sold, including a $3bn offer by ConocoPhillips also intended for refinancing purposes.Other energy-related deals in the pipeline for the coming days include offerings by Canada-based Canbriam Energy and a new loan facility for C&J Energy Services, an independent provider of hydraulic fracturing.“In absolute terms, borrowing costs have increased only marginally for most energy companies in spite of the sell-off in energy bonds,” said Adrian Miller, director of fixed income strategy at GMP Securities.“But the use of proceeds is key here. These companies are no longer borrowing to fund expansion. They are borrowing to pay back debt or refinance it. And they are trying to do this as quickly as possible.”Energy bonds have been under pressure in the past couple of weeks amid a slump in oil prices, which have dropped more than 25 per cent since June.The drop in bond prices has been particularly severe for companies with lower credit ratings, which carry a higher probability of default. The sell-off has helped push yields on the bonds to their highest level in more than one year.New extraction techniques and high oil prices boost US oil productionThe shale boom that has created a surge in US oil and gas production has been financed in part through a steep increase in sales of low-rated debt in the past decade. Energy bonds account for almost 16 per cent of the $1.3tn junk bond market, according to Barclays data, having accounted for just 4.3 per cent in 2004.Investors are worried that a further drop in oil prices could put pressure on the highly indebted companies in the sector and potentially trigger a wave of debt restructurings, which has not been seen since the depths of the financial crisis.Junk-rated energy bonds have been the worst-performing group in the high-yield market, with negative returns of 1.3 per cent in the past month, while the broad market gained 1.2 per cent, according to Barclays indices.The drop in bond prices pushed yields on junk-rated energy bonds to 6.9 per cent at the start of the month, the highest level since July 2013, according to Barclays.“For some investors these ‘downdrafts’ bring an opportunity to buy back some of these energy bonds at a discount,” said Mr Miller. “Some of these deals, especially the higher rated ones, may do well.”
84;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2014-10-27T18:23:56Z;Strike action by miners boosts copper;Planned stoppages at mines in Peru and Indonesia add to supply concerns;Copper moved higher on Monday as reports of strikes at two big mines added to concerns about tight supplies of the red metal.Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange firmed 0.7 per cent to $6,730 a tonne after workers at Peru’s biggest copper mine, Antamina, said they would go on an indefinite strike next month. The mine produces around 30,000 tonnes per month, according to union leaders.Grasberg, a mine owned by Freeport-McMoRan in Indonesia, is also undertaking a month-long strike beginning next week.“These two strikes could “remove” 84,000 [tonnes] of mined copper supply through year-end, assuming zero inventories are processed/shipped and the Antamina strike continues through until the end of the year,” said BMO Capital Markets.Copper has fallen around 9 per cent this year on expectations the market would move into surplus. However, the excess metal has yet to materialise. At the same time, China’s demand has remained strong for power lines and copper used in household goods.For that reason some analysts believe the price could rally in the final months of 2015.Rising commodity prices over the past few years have spurred China to refine more metal at home. China’s refined copper output last month was the highest level since 1990, according to national statistics.Lower prices could entice China’s State Reserve Bureau to make strategic purchases, according to David Wilson, analyst at Citi. Current prices are the lowest in renminbi terms since the financial crisis, he said.“Moreover, the SRB’s budget has been expanded over the past two years, and year-to-date purchases remain far lower than the over 1m tonnes purchased during the financial crisis,” he said in a report.China would be entering a complicated market. Data show up to 79 per cent of copper warrants are being held by one market participant, according to analysts. Much of the copper is held in warehouses in New Orleans, which is owned by a division of Glencore, the commodities group.The impression of a tight market has been exacerbated by the low level of stocks held on LME-controlled warehouses. This has allowed a single buyer to control around half of the copper held in the exchange’s warehouses.Yet calculating true demand is complicated because metal can move out of those warehouses yet still not reach the end user. Instead it is just stored in other warehouses that are not required to report data. That enables the holder to hold on to the metal and sell when prices are higher.
85;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Congo renews push for Grand Inga dam, an African white elephant;;On a wooden stake planted in Africa’s equatorial forest, a small hand-painted sign reads: “Here will be erected the water intake of the Inga 6 power plant.”The hopeful claim refers to the latest plan to realise one of Africa’s largest – and longest stalled – white elephants: Grand Inga, the world’s biggest hydropower dam, not far from where the Congo river flows into the sea.Located in the far western extreme of the Democratic Republic of Congo, several dams and hydropower plants would deliver 42,000MW – nearly twice the size of the world’s largest power station, the Three Gorges Dam in China. If built, it would double the electricity production capacity of Africa in one stroke and resolve what Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, calls Africa’s “energy apartheid”.Grand Inga has for decades been the stuff of dreams. Now, say its World Bank backers, it is the stuff of cogent plans. One sign of Grand Inga’s growing momentum is that it has prompted an unprecedented offer from China to work alongside the US to finance big infrastructure projects in Africa.“Energy is the development of a country,” says Richard Kapia Boshinga, director of the state power company, Snel, standing on a narrow bridge at the Inga rapids. “It’s got to work.”Still, the project faces obstacles as great as its dimensions. Even if Washington and Beijing opt to collaborate, it remains hostage to shaky financing. It is also beset by opposition from environmental groups, poor management and the uncertainties of working in one of the world’s least developed and most corrupt countries.“We think the whole project will cost more than $50bn, but who will invest money like that in Congo?” says Albert Mbafumoya, senior adviser in the office of the prime minister.Two dams – Inga 1 and Inga 2 – already exist, but are in a sorry state. First conceived by Belgian colonialists and built more than 30 years ago under dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, five of their 14 turbines no longer turn, producing only 1,000MW for a country the size of western Europe.The lack of power is hurting miners in the Katanga region of southern Congo, where some facilities are losing the equivalent of a month of annual production due to blackouts.The many previous efforts to develop the site, where the river’s broad brown waters narrow to little more than 100m after gushing down over 15km of rapids, have all stalled. But Congo has this time adopted a plan that some financiers believe might work: a seven-phase effort to build Grand Inga in increments.The incremental approach might lessen the objections of environmentalists, who have warned that the impacts could range from loss of species and agricultural land to coastal erosion and releases of methane gas.The smaller pieces would also be less daunting to finance, starting with Inga 3, which would cost $12bn and deliver 4,800MW.The government in Kinshasa hopes that the World Bank and the regional African Development Bank among others will commit a quarter of the funds. That still leaves nearly $9bn to come from other sources, including the US, China and the private sector.Jan Walliser, an official at the World Bank, says the third phase of Inga looks feasible. But he cautions: “Private investors will not step in until enough electricity can be sold to creditworthy customers – which is why exports to South Africa and sales to the mining sector have to be looked at to make it a viable investment.”South Africa last year agreed to purchase 2,500MW from Inga 3 as well as a chunk of subsequent stages. Kinshasa also hopes the domestic mining sector will take 1,300MW and the rest of Congo another 1,000MW. But the country has a poor record in paying its electricity bills, making it difficult to raise money for a project that cannot guarantee payback.Private investors will not step in until enough electricity can be sold to creditworthy customers – which is why exports to South Africa and sales to the mining sector have to be looked atMr Mbafumoya, the senior adviser, put it bluntly: “Our population doesn’t pay.”After years of delay, mining companies are applying plasters to the existing infrastructure rather than waiting for Inga 3. Glencore, the miner-cum-trader that has several big projects in Katanga , and its partners are lending $368m out of its own pocket to rehabilitate the turbines of Inga 2 as a way to increase electricity production.Freeport-McMoRan, which has a $3bn copper and cobalt mine in Katanga, is lending Snel $220m to build a smaller local power plant. On a recent visit to the mine, the control room charted four blackouts in a single day.“Future expansion will be dependent on our ability to get incremental power, and reliable power,” says Bill Harris, the mine’s president.Moïse Katumbi, the governor of Katanga, agrees. From his office in Lubumbashi, Katanga’s capital, he estimates miners could be digging 1.5m tonnes a year of copper right now, up from the current 0.99m t/y, were it not for the power shortages.“The problem for Inga,” he says, “is that the project took so long.”
86;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2014-07-25T16:36:19Z;Lead jumps to highest in eight months;Recent rally in base metals prices shows no sign of ending;Lead ballooned to an eight-month high on Friday as the recent rally in base metals prices showed no sign of ending.The price of the soft metal, used mainly in the manufacture of automobile and motorcycle batteries, has lagged behind some of its peers recently, and before this week was down for the year. But it broke into positive territory on Thursday, and a further 1.3 per cent gain took the price to $2,266 a tonne, for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange.Industrial metals have benefited from improved investor sentiment towards commodities in recent months. The sector received a further boost from data published on Thursday in China that showed factory activity expanding at the fastest rate in 18 months.China consumes more than 40 per cent of the world’s base metals output.Copper had another strong week, rising for the fifth week out of six, to $7,133 a tonne on the LME. The red metal has now gained 11 per cent since mid-March, when concerns about the Chinese economy sent prices tumbling. The price did, however, dip by 0.5 per cent on Friday, on news that Freeport-McMoRan, the top copper producer in Indonesia, had reached an agreement with the government there that should allow the resumption of copper concentrate exports.Nickel, the star performer among metals in 2014, rose 3 per cent this week to $19,180 a tonne. Used to manufacture stainless steel, nickel has soared 38 per cent this year, after ore exports were banned in Indonesia, a major global supplier.Continued concerns about mine supply stocks and falling warehouse inventories saw zinc make further gains last week. The metal, which is used as a protective coating for iron and steel, rose 4 per cent over the week to trade at $2,387 a tonne on Friday. It has risen 16 per cent so far in 2014.Two big Canadian mines closed last year, eliminating a combined 335,000 tonnes of the rust-inhibiting metal from the market, while several ageing mines in Australia and Europe are expected to stop production in 2015, adding to worries about supplies.At the same time, zinc inventories have fallen sharply. LME warehouse stocks have dropped 30 per cent to 653,900 tonnes, the lowest level since December 2010.Elsewhere, aluminium paused for breath, easing 1.26 per cent to $2,000 a tonne. The lightweight metal, used in everything from aeroplane bodies to beverage cans, has rallied 15 per cent since the end of May. Like zinc, it has benefited from falling warehouses stocks but also smelter closures.Norsk Hydro, a major aluminium producer, said this week that low prices had encouraged companies to shut up to 5m tonnes of aluminium capacity over the past few years. According to its chief executive Svein Richard Brandtzaeg, the global aluminium market is in its best shape since the financial crisis.Despite the recent rally, analysts say the outlook for base metals is mixed. In a note this week, Goldman Sachs said that, taking a 12-month view, it was most bullish on nickel, zinc and aluminium. But it was bearish on copper, saying the market was likely to be in surplus this year and also in 2015, when it expected average prices of $6,400 a tonne.
87;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2014-07-23T14:49:23Z;Freeport-McMoRan close to Indonesian deal;;Freeport-McMoRan is on the verge of signing a deal with Indonesia that will lift curbs on exports from one of the world’s largest copper mines.The copper miner was among foreign companies hit by a ban on exports from Indonesia since the start of this year after the government decided more metal should be processed within the country rather than shipped as concentrate.Freeport said on Wednesday it expected a memorandum of understanding to be signed “imminently” with the government to allow exports to resume in August. Freeport would pay a $115m bond to underpin a commitment to develop a smelter. The company would also agree to higher royalty payments on gold and copper from the Grasberg mine.“We are encouraged by our discussions with the Indonesian government toward reaching a near-term agreement,” the company said.This year the mine has been operating at about half its normal rate, with some of its output being smelted locally.Freeport and Newmont Mining, the US gold miner, were the largest foreign miners hit by the Indonesian export ban, which also significantly tightened the world supply of nickel. Newmont has halted operations and this month filed an arbitration claim against the government to try to overcome the export restrictions.International mining companies hope incoming president Joko Widodo can build better relations but Mr Widodo has said he will stick to the export ban.Freeport said it assumed exports would resume next month but said it would otherwise bring in plans to reduce operating costs, defer capital expenditure and cut its workforce.In its second-quarter earnings Freeport said net income was flat at $482m, or $0.46 per share, compared with the same period in 2013. Revenues rose from $4.3 to $5.5bn.Freeport, one of the few miners that also has extensive oil and gas interests, shuffled part of its portfolio in the quarter, selling holdings in Texas’s Eagle Ford shale to Encana for $3.1bn and putting part of the proceeds into buying deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets.
88;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2014-07-09T16:40:02Z;Copper on the rebound as sentiment shifts;;Just a few months ago, the best-known base metal was looking like the least loved. Copper, first mined 10,000 years ago and used extensively in construction and electrical applications, tumbled 10 per cent in the first quarter of the year to $6,430 a tonne, and hit its lowest level since 2010.The fall was sparked by events in China, which consumes more than 40 per cent of global copper supply. The country’s first domestic bond default raised fears about the economy, and the possible unwinding of financing deals using copper as collateral. With a surge in mine production anticipated this year, further price falls seemed possible. Thomson Reuters GFMS, a metals research firm, said in its annual industry survey in April that copper could test $6,000 a tonne this year. Goldman Sachs forecast a year-end price of $6,200 a tonne.That now seems a long way away. Despite a blip in June, due to worries about an alleged metals fraud in the Chinese port of Qingdao, copper has rebounded 8 per cent since March. On Wednesday afternoon, at $7,140 a tonne for three month delivery on the London Metal Exchange, the price is down just 3 per cent for the year.Several factors have contributed to the red metal’s rebound. The first is a general shift in investor sentiment towards commodities that has also dragged other metal prices higher, from palladium to nickel and aluminium. Better economic data from China, where factory output is increasing, have also helped.“Around April, a lot of funds were bearish on China,” says Matthew Wonnacott, an analyst at CRU, a commodities consultancy. “Now, the idea that it will have a not-so-bad year has been good for the copper price.”Shifting expectations of supply and demand have worked in copper’s favour too. While Chinese demand in the first quarter was poor, it has since picked up, and year on year growth of about 5.5 per cent appears achievable, according to Vivienne Lloyd, base metals analyst at Macquarie. US and EU consumption has also been healthy.Although mine production is increasing, with two new operations in Chile coming on line in June, supply of refined metal has disappointed.Problems and maintenance shutdowns at smelters in China in the first half of the year have limited refined copper production. In addition, some smelters deliberately pushed through less material while prices were below $7,000 a tonne, according to an analyst at one of the world’s biggest metals traders.“These guys make more money when prices are higher, so they were in no rush to produce,” the trader says. “You can mine as much copper as you like, but you are still dependent on these guys [in China] to turn it into refined product.”As a result, copper analysts are having to change their models. CRU, which had forecast a refined metal surplus of 100,000 tonnes for 2014, now reckons the market will be balanced, and in deficit if China’s State Reserves Bureau “takes a chunk out of the market” for its stockpile, as it does periodically.“The surplus narrative is not as strong as it was at the start of the year,” Mr Wonnacott says.Additional support for the copper price has come from new laws in Indonesia, which are designed to spur local manufacturing. The government’s ban on mineral ore exports in January mainly had an impact on producers of nickel and bauxite. But copper miners have also been affected by higher export taxes. This is important because Indonesia produces a lot of “clean” concentrates that contain few impurities and are in high demand in China. Neither Freeport-McMoRan, which operates the Grasberg mine, one of the world’s biggest, nor Newmont’s, with its Batu Hijau mine, have exported copper concentrate under the new legislation.A compromise on the export taxes is still possible but the presidential election has pushed the issue down the government’s list of priorities. As a result, Newmont has shuttered its mine and taken the Indonesian government to international arbitration.“Indonesia has a lot to do with the [copper] price rising,” says George Cheveley, a fund manager at Investec Asset Management. “There continues to be uncertainty as to when we will see exports. Reports in recent days suggest a settlement may be close but we have heard this before.”It is not all good news for copper bulls. With higher prices, and few scheduled closures, Chinese smelters are expected to increase production later this year. Stephen Briggs, an analyst at BNP Paribas, says a sustained rally above $7,000 a tonne is not justified.Analysts at Macquarie agree, writing in a report that “our outlook for the copper price is for a downturn” in the second half of the year.
89;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2014-06-05T10:33:59Z;Newmont halts Indonesia mining operations;;US mining group Newmont has halted operations at its Indonesian gold and copper mine and will put 3,200 workers on leave with reduced pay from Friday, after it failed to reach a compromise with the government over export restrictions.Indonesia is a key global supplier of metals and a law implemented in January banning exports of raw minerals unless companies build processing plants has thrown the industry into turmoil.The measure, which is designed to promote industrial development in southeast Asia’s biggest economy, has forced many producers to shut down, sending the global price of nickel soaring and prompting threats of legal action from companies including Newmont.The US miner and its counterpart Freeport-McMoRan, which operates a much larger copper and gold mine in Indonesia, both claim that the export restrictions breach their contracts of work and have been locked in negotiations with mining officials for months to find a workaround.Officials and industry executives have said the government and the companies were close to a deal under which the miners would agree to build a copper smelter and be allowed to resume exports if they pay a small export tax.If there was a complete cessation of exports out of Indonesia, it would make a significant difference to the global marketBut Newmont said on Thursday that with its storage facilities full and talks still inconclusive it was no longer able to continue mining operations.“We have taken numerous steps to help resolve the export issue and support the government’s desire to increase in-country smelting,” said Martiono Hadianto, president director of Newmont Nusa Tenggara, the group’s local subsidiary. “However, despite our best efforts, we have not been able to export copper concentrate since January and we still do not have an export permit.”The discussions have been complicated by Indonesia’s upcoming presidential election on July 9, with incumbent Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono stepping down after reaching the two-term limit. Both presidential candidates, Prabowo Subianto and Joko Widodo, have indicated they will keep the mineral export ban in place.Newmont said on Thursday that it was putting 80 per cent of the 4,000 employees at its Batu Hijau mine, on the island of Sumbawa, on leave with reduced pay, leaving a skeleton staff responsible for “care and maintenance” at the site.Freeport has warned previously that the export ban would force it to cut production by 60 per cent, resulting in 15,000 job losses and costing the government an annual $1.6bn in lost royalties and taxes.But Mr Hadianto said he was hopeful that “continued dialogue with the government will lead to resolution in the near term”.Jim Lennon, a metals consultant for Macquarie, the investment bank, said the Newmont shutdown was unlikely to have an immediate impact on the international copper market given that Indonesia only produces about 1.5 per cent of global supply.By contrast, Indonesia accounts for about a quarter of global nickel and prices of that metal have soared by more than 40 per cent since the export ban came into force.Mr Lennon added that there could be long-term consequences if Newmont and Freeport do not iron out their differences with the Indonesian government soon. “If there was a complete cessation of exports out of Indonesia, it would make a significant difference to the global market,” he said.“But there is a widespread expectation that they will reach a deal on a smelter soon and will resume exports.”

The assets being sold produced 53,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of this year, Freeport said.Encana, of Canada, said the deal would approximately double its oil production and would help a strategy of diversifying. “We’re replacing natural gas production with high margin oil and liquids production,” said Doug Suttles, Encana’s chief executive.The assets in the deal produced operating cash flow of $327m in the first three months of the year, Encana said.Freeport had said last month that it was looking for faster ways to cut its net debt of more than $19bn and said it was in talks over possible asset sales and joint ventures. It wants to make “significant” debt reductions by the end of 2016.About half of the net $2.5bn of after-tax proceeds from the Eagle Ford sale would be used to repay debt, Freeport said, while the remainder would be used for its deepwater investments.James Flores, chief executive of Freeport’s oil and gas division, said the Gulf was a strategic growth area with “industry leading margins, high impact long-term growth opportunities and superior investment returns”.Tony Robson, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said: “While the financial markets may like the sale, the high margin oil-rich Eagle Ford was a key part of [Freeport’s] energy production profile. Selling a key asset to allow for debt reductions and help fund capex sends very mixed signals to investors.”The Arizona-based group is best known as the world’s largest private sector copper miner but is one of the few big miners that has diversified into oil and gas. BHP Billiton, the world’s largest miner by market capitalisation, is investing $4bn annually to raise its own US onshore shale production to 200,000 bpd by 2017, much of it from the Eagle Ford shale.In a presentation Encana said the assets it was buying from Freeport were in the Karnes Trough, considered “the core of the core of the Eagle Ford”. Encana said it would ramp up drilling activity this year after the acquisition closes.

Broadly, however, investor shifts seem to point to further weakness, he says.“Although a short-term trading focus generally does not mesh well with most institutional fund managers’s management style, we expect that shorter, more volatile multi-week rotations are likely to persist through the second quarter and into the third,” Mr Sluymer said.Tesla shares declined 2.11 per cent to $193.91, Facebook fell 3 per cent before recovering to close slightly higher at $59.08 and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals slipped by 0.67 per cent to $288.08.Coca-Cola led the benchmark S&P 500 after the company reported adjusted earnings that matched Wall Street expectations.First-quarter profits fell to $1.62bn, or 36 cents a share, from $1.75bn, or 39 cents a share, in the same quarter in 2013.Revenues declined 4 per cent to $10.6bn. When adjusting for certain items, Coca-Cola said it earned 44 cents per share.The Atlanta-based company said volumes of sparkling beverages in the North American market fell 1 per cent during the quarter.On a call with analysts, chairman and chief executive Muhtar Kent said he was determined to “accelerate” sparkling beverage growth by increasing marketing efforts as well as making new investments to support its brands.“These strategies to accelerate sparkling growth are solid and we expect to see improving results throughout the year,” he said.Shares in Coca-Cola rose 3.72 per cent to close at $40.17.Aaron’s, the US retailer that specialises in renting and selling furniture, was under pressure on Tuesday after the company rejected a takeover proposal and announced it had purchased a retail credit financing firm.The company has agreed to pay $700m for Progressive Finance Holdings, a maker of software used by retailers in the controversial so-called “lease to own” part of the retail market.Aaron’s, which has a market value of about $2.1bn, also rebuffed a takeover offer from private equity firm Vintage Capital. Shares in the company declined just over 4 per cent to end at $29.24.Overall, US equity indices shook off early declines to end the day slightly higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.68 per cent to 1,842.98 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.55 per cent higher at 16,262.56. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.29 per cent to close at 4,034.16.
92;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2014-03-16T19:05:44Z;Copper miners eye increase in output;Prices for the red metal fell to lowest level since 2010 last week;Copper producers plan to expand mine capacity and output to record levels again this year, underlining potential additional downward pressures on prices, which have fallen steeply recently.Prices for the red metal tumbled last week to the lowest level since 2010, amid signs of sluggish demand and the building up of inventories in China, by far the largest market for copper and most other metals. The copper market is closely watched as a gauge of global economic health.Global copper miners – of which the largest are Codelco of Chile, Freeport-McMoRan, Glencore Xstrata and BHP Billiton – plan expansions of mine capacity that would add between 1.1m tonnes and 1.3m tonnes of copper annually to the market until 2016, according to data provider SNL Financial.Such increases would be roughly equivalent to the annual output of Escondida, the world’s largest mine, which provides about 5 per cent of world supply.“Mined copper supply is starting to expand at a faster pace than demand after a long period of constrained and disrupted output growth,” said Rio Tinto in its annual report published on Friday.The expansion plans highlight how copper is one of global miners’ most favoured metals for investment, given expectations of robust demand over the longer term.However, a number of the expansion plans may have to be delayed or revised if the current weakness in the market persists.The planned capacity expansion would follow an increase of more than 6 per cent last year in worldwide copper output, which was significantly higher than the trend of previous years. Almost all the world’s largest copper miners expanded production.Tim Huff, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: “We think a lot of intended projects are going to come through on time and there will be a surplus of mine output this year and next, although there is always the probability that some will arrive more slowly than intended.“The major companies have the greatest capability to deliver projects. It is the smaller mining companies that are probably most likely to face delays.”The increases expected during 2014 would be led mainly by growth at so-called “greenfield” mines – those built from scratch. Rio is ramping up one of the world’s largest new copper mines, Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia, which started production last year. Other big mines starting are Peru’s Toromocho, owned by Chinalco, the Chinese group, and Ministro Hales, run by Codelco, the Chilean state miner.Paul Dewison, an analyst at SNL, said not all of the mine capacity expected to be added in the next few years would necessarily lead to higher output. “Especially if current prices are below break-even for the mines concerned, we see much lower mine output growth than the sum of intended projects minus losses from depleting mines,” he said.Ignace Proot, analyst at Bernstein Research in New York, said the marginal cost of copper production should support the current price level for a couple of months.“We should not be too worried about the current low price and I believe that a price support level based on the cost curve will soon exist . . . We will gradually see China’s physical metal demand increasing,” Mr Proot said. “The demand fundamentals for copper remain intact.”
93;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2014-01-12T10:14:14Z;Indonesia slaps ban on mineral exports;;Indonesia has implemented a hotly contested ban on the export of unprocessed minerals after agreeing last minute carve-outs that are expected to grant a temporary reprieve to the country’s biggest foreign miners, Freeport McMoRan and Newmont.The government claims the requirement to process ore domestically will boost industrial development but mining companies and economists have argued that the move will instead lead to mass lay-offs and shrink export revenues at a time when Indonesia is already suffering from a widening current-account deficit.The ban, which was first written into law in 2009, was scheduled for introduction on Sunday. Eleventh-hour negotiations between mining companies and the government resulted in ministers giving an impromptu press conference just before midnight at the house of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, outside Jakarta.“Starting from midnight on January 12 2014, the export of raw minerals or ore is banned,” said Jero Wacik, the minister for energy and mineral resources. “The goal is in line with the law, to increase the added value.”But the ministers said that in order to minimise job losses and damage to the local economy in mining areas, there would be temporary exemptions for those companies who plan to build smelters and those who were exporting certain types of already “concentrated” products, such as Freeport and Newmont.However, full details of the last-minute compromise are yet to emerge, underlining the policy confusion that has deterred many companies from investing in Indonesia’s mining sector, despite its great potential.The ban could add to pressure on Indonesia’s fragile financial position, costing it several billions of dollars in export revenue when it is already suffering a large current-account deficit, importing more than it exports. This has weighed on the rupiah, one of the world’s worst-performing currencies last year.Mining executives warned that, especially with parliamentary and presidential elections due in April and July respectively, the mining regulations could well be changed again in the coming months.“We can work with most regulatory regimes around the world but it is the constant change in Indonesia from export restrictions to divestment rules that makes it so tough,” said one senior mining executive in Jakarta. “It is no longer set up for major new mines that take years and require billions of dollars of investment up front like Freeport’s Grasberg and Newmont’s Batu Hijau.”Indonesia is a major player in global metal markets, accounting for around 20 per cent of world nickel supply and 10 per cent of aluminium supply, and the wrangling over the ban has been closely watched by traders around the world as well as by manufacturers in China, who rely on Indonesian nickel ore for stainless steel production and Indonesian bauxite to make aluminium.Nickel prices in London jumped by 3 per cent on Friday in anticipation of the ban, which is expected still to be applied to nickel ore and bauxite, which is mostly by produced by small Indonesian miners unable to bear the cost of building smelters.Poltak Sitanggang, chairman of the Indonesian mineral mining association, a lobby group for small miners, said thousands of workers had already been sent home because companies were struggling to cope with the uncertainty.“Some banks asked miners to repay loans before January 12 and some have already had difficulties with their buyers and suppliers because of this regulation,” he said. “We support the government in wanting to add more value but we don’t support this sudden stop. We also don’t understand why Newmont and Freeport have been given exemptions but not small Indonesian miners.”

But the niche market for the metal, used in batteries and high-performance alloys, may show the way forward for price discovery in a post-Libor world.The $2bn-a-year cobalt market is in the midst of an upheaval. After more than two decades during which the cobalt industry has used the price assessments of journalists at Metal Bulletin as a benchmark for transactions, the market is now shifting to adopt the London Metal Exchange contract.Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world’s largest miners and refiners of cobalt, last month announced that from the beginning of next year it will no longer use Metal Bulletin prices. “We believe there is general acceptance among customers and suppliers to move to LME based pricing for cobalt,” said David Elliott, senior vice- president at Freeport.Others are following more quietly. ENRC, another top-three producer, is also planning to introduce an element of LME pricing into its contracts from next year, traders say, selling its cobalt using a weighted average of the LME and MB prices.“We’re at a tipping point,” says Guy Darby, founder of cobalt trading house Darton Commodities and a former chairman of the Minor Metals Trade Association. Between them, Freeport and ENRC account for more than a quarter of global mine production of cobalt.The cobalt industry’s shift has been years in the making and has a number of drivers. But traders and industry executives say it has been catalysed by regulators’ recent scrutiny of benchmarks and drive for exchange-based pricing.While commodities such as copper, cotton and corn have been traded on exchanges for more than a century, others have been slower to develop.It was not until the 1980s that aluminium producers gave up trying to sell their metal at an announced price and adopted the LME contract, while the price of iron ore – one of the world’s most important raw materials – was set in annual negotiations between three dominant suppliers and their customers until 2010.Cobalt itself was sold at the so-called “African Producer Price” set by Gécamines of Congo and ZCCM of Zambia until the early 1990s, when the MB index was launched.But benchmarks based on producer announcements, negotiations, or gathering of market information by so-called “price reporting agencies” such as MB have come under scrutiny as regulators have investigated one market after another, from Libor, to foreign exchange and oil.“People are definitely moving away from producer pricing and survey pricing to exchange-based pricing,” says Robert Fig, business development executive at the LME. “It’s a culture that’s spanning every commodity at the moment.”The move towards the LME is also the result of several factors specific to the cobalt industry, however.For a start, the move has in part been driven by dissatisfaction among some market participants with the MB index that predates the regulatory furore over benchmarks. Liquidity in the spot European cobalt market has been thin in recent years, traders say, leading some to question the reliability of the MB index.“A $2bn-plus industry needs to get beyond being priced by one journalist sitting in London,” says Mr Darby.Moreover, the LME launched cobalt trading in 2010, giving companies nearly four years to become comfortable with the contract, a situation that could not easily be replicated in other markets.And not everyone is convinced the cobalt industry will switch to LME pricing straight away.While Freeport, ENRC, and Votorantim of Brazil are leading the push towards the LME, other large producers are sticking with MB for now, traders say, arguing that the LME contract is still too illiquid. The largest miner and trader of cobalt is Glencore Xstrata.Raju Daswani, managing director of MB, says he does not believe the shift to LME pricing in cobalt is yet “conclusive”, but adds that MB will respond to the industry’s evolution by publishing cobalt “premiums” – or price differentials based on the LME market. “Our job is to listen and move with the times.”“These things don’t happen overnight,” says an executive at a leading producer, estimating that it could be three to five years before the LME contract is universally adopted. But he adds: “It is inevitable that LME will become the benchmark for the whole industry.”As such, the cobalt market may offer a sign of things to come for other larger markets such as iron ore and coal, says Colin Hamilton, head of commodities research at Macquarie.“It’s a natural development of a lot of these markets,” Mr Hamilton says, pointing out that the iron ore and thermal coal markets are already moving away from journalistic indices towards screen-traded pricing. “The fact that the regulators are taking a point of view on these things will accelerate the process.”
95;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2013-10-09T18:11:29Z;Supply of copper set to outstrip demand;;Leading copper miners and traders have said they expect supply to outstrip demand next year as a wave of new projects begins production, a development that suggests prices will continue falling for the benchmark industrial metal.The price of copper, used in electrical wiring, has fallen 30 per cent from record highs in 2011 amid slowing Chinese demand and rising supply.The shift into surplus marks a dramatic change from market trends of the past decade when surging Chinese growth combined with chronic mine underperformance to drive copper prices higher. The metal became emblematic of the so-called “commodities supercycle” and triggered windfall profits for miners such as Codelco and Freeport-McMoRan and major exporters such as Chile, Peru and Zambia.But Hernan de Solminihac, Chilean mining minister, predicted that next year “prices will drop a little” because of an increase in supply, with new projects in Chile, Peru, Indonesia and Mongolia all adding to global output. Thomas Keller, chief executive of Codelco, the world’s largest copper miner, said he expected the market to see “a small surplus as a number of new projects come into production”.The implication is likely to be lower copper prices, said Gu Liangmin, head of copper at Minmetals, the Chinese state-owned mining and trading group. He predicted that the metal would trade in a range of $6,500-$7,500 a tonne next year, compared to current prices of $7,100, already down 10 per cent so far this year.The expectation of a shift into surplus in the copper market was echoed by many of the traders, analysts and hedge fund managers assembled in London for LME Week, the largest annual gathering of the metals and mining industry. For the first time since 2008, investors polled by Macquarie did not pick copper as their favourite metal for next year.However, few expect a collapse in prices, as a recovering global economy lifts copper demand. “The surplus we are forecasting is very modest,” Mr Keller of Codelco said, predicting a “really marginal” oversupply of 300,000-400,000 tonnes, compared to annual consumption of more than 20m tonnes.“We should continue to see prices moving around current levels,” he said.Indeed, not everyone believes that the oversupply will be long-lived: the mining industry has a long record of under-delivering on promised production.Mr de Solminihac said the trajectory for copper prices beyond next year would depend on how much of the expected supply really materialises – a significant uncertainty as miners review their spending plans.Diego Hernández, chief executive of London-listed copper miner Antofagasta, predicted that after two years of surplus in 2014 and 2015 the copper market would return to a “tight supply-demand balance”.
96;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2013-06-24T17:39:28Z;Copper hits three-year low;;Industrial metals tumbled with copper hitting a three-year low as traders feared that China’s liquidity squeeze could dent demand in the world’s top metals consumer.The spike in short-term lending rates in China, together with softer data on the economy, has rattled metals and mining investors.China is the world’s largest consumer of industrial metals, accounting for 40 per cent or more of global demand for each, and the economic slowdown has inspired many funds to bet against the sector.Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange tumbled as much as 3.4 per cent to $6,613 a tonne on Monday morning – the lowest since July 2010.The shares of mining companies including Rio Tinto, Vale, Anglo American and Freeport McMoRan each fell by more than 3 per cent.“There are no buyers out there,” said Jake Greenberg, metals and mining specialist at Jefferies. “These are aggressive moves after aggressive moves.”Copper traders had already been nervous about credit availability in China after the government promised in May to crack down on the use of copper as collateral to obtain financing.Goldman Sachs described the unwinding of these financing deals as a “bearish risk” that “complicates our near-term bullish copper view”.In addition, the broader flight from risk following the US Federal Reserve’s suggestion that it would begin to taper its asset purchases has caused the dollar to strengthen – putting pressure on the dollar-denominated prices of commodities.The People’s Bank of China’s comments over the weekend that liquidity was at a “reasonable level” despite a jump in benchmark interbank interest rates was enough to trigger a broad sell-off.Beyond copper, other metals also plunged to fresh multiyear lows.Benchmark LME aluminium prices hit a four-year low of $1,772.25 a tonne while platinum fell 3.9 per cent to a 2½-year low of $1,321.25 a troy ounce and nickel slid towards last week’s four-year low of $13,630 a tonne.The tumble in metals prices is putting pressure on miners and smelters.Aluminium and nickel prices are trading well below the levels at which analysts reckon the highest cost producers are losing money while South African platinum miners are now contending with sharply falling platinum prices as well as the possibility of strikes.

98;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2013-06-03T13:09:05Z;Indonesia orders Freeport to shut mine pending cave-in probe;;The Indonesian government has ordered Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the US mining group, to halt production at its copper and gold mine in Papua province for three months while it completes an investigation into a fatal cave-in at an underground training centre.Twenty-eight people died in the incident at the Grasberg site on May 14 – one of the worst-ever mining disasters in resource-rich Indonesia. The government announced the shutdown on Monday after another worker died over the weekend in an unrelated accident.Grasberg, one of the world’s biggest copper and gold deposits, has been plagued by problems, including a shutdown caused by a strike in 2011 and a succession of fatal shootings.Dede Suhendra, a senior official at Indonesia’s ministry of energy and mineral resources, said production would be halted for three months while a government team investigates the cause of the May disaster and explored the risks of other such incidents.“There must be a financial impact but the workers’ safety is more important,” he said.Analysts said the company had yet to declare “force majeure”, which implied it was still able to meet its contractual obligations from its stockpile. The shutdown has yet to impact copper prices significantly, with global supplies still thought to be sufficient and most analysts having factored in the potential for such “disruption losses”.Freeport is the biggest single taxpayer in Indonesia, contributing $2.4bn to the state coffers in 2011.The May incident raised concerns among environmentalists and trade unions about the company’s ambitious plans to accelerate underground mining as its exhausts the supplies from the main open pit at Grasberg.Freeport is planning to invest $715m a year to expand its underground mining capacity over the next five years.Virgo Solossa, the head of the company’s Indonesian trade union, which represents 18,000 of the mine’s 24,000 workers, said they supported the government shutdown.A spokesman for Freeport Indonesia, of which Freeport owns 91 per cent and the Indonesian government 9 per cent, said the company was “not producing concentrates at this time” and was “awaiting government approvals to restart operations”.David Wilson, a metals analyst at Citi in London, said prices had yet to react to the shutdown in Indonesia.“Everyone is focusing on the bigger picture at the moment, looking at macro issues rather than fundamentals,” he said.Freeport Indonesia sold 716m pounds of copper and 915,000 ounces of gold in 2012 and was hoping to increase sales substantially this year to 1.1bn pounds of copper and 1.2m ounces of gold.Analysts said the company may struggle to meet these targets because of the shutdown. Freeport declined to comment.Shares of the US miner, which is spending $20bn on acquisitions to deepen its oil and gas exposure, were up $0.14 at $31.19 in pre-market trading in New York, only slightly lower than on May 14, when they closed at $31.57.Additional reporting by Taufan Hidayat in Jakarta
99;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2013-05-22T17:33:27Z;Copper higher as no end seen to Grasberg closure;;Worries about tighter supplies pushed up copper prices to a six-week high as a production outage at Indonesia’s Grasberg, one world’s largest copper mines, looked set to continue.Operations at Grasberg, the mine owned by Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold in the province of Papua, were suspended last week after a tunnel collapsed in an underground training centre, leading to 28 fatalities. Richard Adkerson, chief executive of the Arizona-based miner, landed in Indonesia this week, with the company announcing that it was too early to say when production would resume.The output stoppage at Grasberg follows a landslide at Kennecott Utah Copper’s Bingham Canyon Mine last month, and the recent shutdown of India’s two top copper smelters.The red metal, which hit an 18-month low last month of $6,762.25 a tonne, has since risen 11 per cent on worries about supply. Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange hit $7,533.75 a tonne before paring its gains to $7,450 on Wednesday.Morgan Stanley said the supply surplus worries which had been weighing on copper prices for the first five months of the year were receding. “The bear’s stranglehold on copper is showing signs of easing,” said the bank.The tragic deaths and 10 injuries would further complicate Freeport’s negotiations with the unions, said analysts. Freeport has had difficult labour relations at its Grasberg mine and has struggled with strikes. “In our view, the real issue for this company/operation and the copper market is the effect this accident will have on subsequent labour contract negotiations, particularly in regards to safety issues,” said Morgan Stanley.The last major strike at Freeport occurred during the last round of contract negotiations in 2011 and lasted for three months and resulted in a production loss exceeding 100,000 tonnes.On the demand side, although the latest Chinese trade data pointed to refined copper imports at the lowest levels for two years, analysts said trading indicators suggested that physical markets in China remained tight.Premiums on physical copper remained high, while copper for immediate delivery in Shanghai were higher than futures prices, indicating firm demand. Levels for stocks in warehouses were also falling, said Barclays, adding that “this should lend support to prices in the short term, though Chinese buying could start to run out of steam in July/August”.

It will be run in partnership with Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold. an international mining company and Bluedrop Performance Learning. Thunderbird hopes the programme will reach 3,400 women over a five-year period.The course will build on the success of a programme Thunderbird launched last year which uses telenovelas or television drama as a way of delivering business education to female micro-entrepreneurs in Peru.Core management topics covered in the programme, DreamBuilder: the Women’s Business Creator, include business planning, accounting, financial reporting, branding, pricing, customer service, human resources and goal setting. Participants can complete the 12 classes of the programme at their own pace before creating their own online business plan.The mining communities of Tierra Amarilla, Copiapό, Caldera and Calama in Chile and Arequipa in Peru have high levels of unemployment, poverty and households headed by women. Freeport-McMoRan has invested in computers and internet access in these communities and Thunderbird hopes that the programme will have a positive impact on each community.The programme is part of the school’s Thunderbird for Good initiative which focuses on educating female entrepreneurs in developing countries and has trained more than 75,000 women in 25 countries since it was created in 2005.www.thunderbird.edu
101;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2013-04-19T07:08:44Z;Indonesian mining policy: backtracking elegantly;;"When is a new policy not a new policy? When it’s introduced by the Indonesian government, which has a tendency to rush out new measures with minimal consultation, sparking protests from those affected and eventually leading officials to backtrack with all the elegance of Michael Jackson doing the moonwalk.The latest example is the government’s ban on the export of raw minerals, which was meant to force mining companies to build costly smelters and processing plants by 2014 as part of a broader goal to produce more “value-added” products in Indonesia.The proposal sent foreign mining executives from the likes of America’s Freeport McMoRan and Newmont, which operate vast gold and copper mines in the country, into paroxysms of panic and rage. They claimed it was unfeasible to build big smelters in Indonesia at such short notice and that the country lacked the power capacity and the demand for such facilities.And now there are signs that officials from Indonesia’s ministry of energy and mineral resources are backtracking.At an Australian mining conference in Jakarta this week, Susilo Siswoutomo, the vice minister, suggested that mining companies need not make large new investments in order to meet the new requirement to process their minerals.“The word ‘process’ does not mean you have to build a smelter. We don’t want people to export our land but sometimes all you need to do is wash [the minerals] or separate the mud.”The tone of his speech, in which he insisted that Indonesia wanted to attract more foreign investors to its under-explored mining sector rather than scaring them away, was somewhat reassuring to mining executives in the room.Like people suffering bereavement, foreign investors facing tough new nationalistic policies in emerging markets tend to go through five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.Most foreign miners in Indonesia are still in the bargaining phase and, if the government does water down its requirements for processing, perhaps they can avoid the depression.Jero Wacik, the minister of energy and mineral resources, accepted recently that it would be impossible for many companies to meet the 2014 smelter requirement and promised to help miners find “loopholes” to get around the law.But, while these more supportive noises might be appreciated, Indonesia-based executives at Freeport and Newmont may find it hard to persuade their directors and legal counsel at head office to back multi-billion dollar investments based on such muddy compromises.Related reading:

Prices for both have plummeted. Freeport’s shares were down 3 per cent on Monday on reports that China’s economy, and by implication copper demand, was slowing. So Thursday’s earning report was somewhat anticlimactic. Sales, as expected, were down year over year as higher copper sales volume couldn’t compensate falling prices.The real drag on Freeport shares, however, is not metal prices but its $20bn foray into oil and gas. It announced plans to buy Plains Exploration and McMoRan Exploration in December. The stock fell from $38 to $31 then, and has remained around there since.Management believes the company must diversify in the way that BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto already have. Admittedly, buying another miner might not have been wise, with the global economy wobbling and the industry recovering from a decades-long acquisition binge. But oil and gas?The Plains and McMoRan assets are all in the US, a virtue when its foreign mines are in unstable parts of the world. And the cash flow from the new businesses could fund future expansion in copper. It all comes down to whether management can execute, despite increasing Freeport’s net debt from essentially zero to $16bn, not too high compared with $12bn in earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation. But the company projects a combined $7bn of capital expenditures this year alone.Freeport investors who remain unenthusiastic about the venture into energy may have a get-out, courtesy of the targets’ shareholders. Plains investors are clamouring for a higher bid. Half of the price was to be paid in (now much cheaper) Freeport shares, and a newly discovered oilfield has shown promise. McMoRan shareholders are also protesting that its management may not have negotiated top value. Freeport may just be destined to remain a copper company.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
103;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2013-04-16T15:12:35Z;Copper: supply and demand;As China slows, investors need to target miners at lower end of cost curve;Copper was supposed to be the metal that could withstand any slowdown in China. Relative geological scarcity, exacerbated by bad weather, earthquakes, permits and declining grades in old mines is a constraint on supply. Reserves in Chile, the world’s biggest producer, are falling by an average 5 per cent a year. Yet the copper price has fallen by 5 per cent since China, the world’s largest importer of the red metal, announced worse than expected growth for the first quarter on Monday.Yet any geological advantage that should support a commodity price is not helped by the wrong mining strategy. The 5 per cent expected growth in copper production this year marks the fastest supply growth in over a decade and still includes supply disruptions such as those at Rio Tinto, according to Wood Mackenzie data. If the slowdown in China continues, this is a problem.Cash costs among the world’s copper miners average around $5,000 a tonne. With prices around $7,100 today, profits are being squeezed – back in 2011 prices were over $10,000. The fall in the price of gold will hurt cash costs further since two-fifths of the world’s copper mines gain some form of byproduct cost credit, says Bernstein. At Antofagasta, for example, credits from by-products such as gold and molybdenum helped to reduce cash costs of mining copper by a quarter last year.In the medium term the slowdown in China is sure to weaken real demand for copper. Especially where the large amounts stored in bonded warehouses compound any excess supply. Unlike steel, copper intensity in China has been constrained by price and as a result remains below that of peak levels in the US, which historically benefited from its own large domestic supplies. Rio Tinto, Freeport-McMoRan and BHP Billiton remain at the lower end of the cost curve. That is where investors should keep their focus.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
104;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2013-04-09T20:32:34Z;Wall St moves higher ahead of Fed minutes;;JC Penney shares dropped sharply after the struggling department store chain announced that chief executive Ron Johnson will be replaced by his predecessor Mike Ullman. Mr Johnson took over at the company in 2011 and presided over a disastrous fall in sales.Shares initially surged as much as 10 per cent in the after-hours market when news broke out that Mr Johnson had been fired. However, they reversed gains and sold off after the company said Mr Ullman would return as chief executive. The stock fell 12.2 per cent to $13.93 on Tuesday and has lost nearly a third of its market value since the start of the year.Analysts at Morgan Stanley view Mr Johnson’s exit and Mr Ullman’s return as a positive step, but express caution about core challenges.“JC Penney struggles to drive sales with a concentration of private label brands with little to no meaning in today’s market,” the research note said.Rival department stores were down slightly, with Kohl’s down 1.3 per cent to $47.42 and Macy’s was down 0.7 at $43.67.Overall, US equity markets moved higher after initial wobbles, shrugging off concerns over weak quarterly earnings and ahead of the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting in March, due on Wednesday.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,568.60, after briefly breaking through the previous closing high reached last week. Seven of 10 main sectors finished in positive territory, with materials and financials stocks leading the gains.Robbert van Batenburg, director of market strategy at Newedge, called the recent market rally a “Lance Armstrong rally, powering ahead by artificial stimulants”.“When considering scenarios for a significant pullback in the US stock market, there are two that stand out. The first is that the stock market retraces as it anticipates the end of the current double dose of QE,” he said.“The more concerning scenario is a market correction fuelled by global cross currents, even though the Fed is still in full QE mode. This could create fears that the Fed stimulus is becoming ineffective and could in turn question the sustainability of the economic recovery.”The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent higher at $3,237.86.As rivalry in the mobile search space heated up, stocks such as Microsoft, Yahoo and Google were in focus. Microsoft rose 3.6 per cent to $29.61 after it teamed up with Nokia and Expedia to file an antitrust complaint against Google.Yahoo shares also rose 1.5 per cent to $23.83. However, Google shrugged off such concerns and closed 0.4 per cent higher at $777.65.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip companies and is a price-weighted index, added 0.4 per cent higher at 14,673.46.Materials stocks were attracting buyers. Mining companies such as Newmont Mining and Freeport-McMoRan were rallying, up 2.6 per cent to $40.03 and 4.1 per cent to $33.76 respectively. Cliffs Natural Resources climbed 8.8 per cent to $20.45.Shares in Alcoa were volatile and was unchanged from the previous closing price of $8.39. Thanks to demand from aerospace and motor manufacturers, the company reported a better than expected 59 per cent rise in first-quarter net income. The aluminium producer’s forecast for just 7 per cent growth in global demand for the metal disappointed, however.First Solar shares soared 45.5 per cent to $39.35 after the world’s largest thin-solar panel maker issued full-year guidance and held a conference call with analysts and investors. The company forecast a long-term profit margin of 20-22 per cent and expected sales of $3.8-$4bn. The dramatic rise in the price was also due to a short squeeze as the nearly 30 per cent of outstanding shares were being shorted up until last week, according to Markit data. The stock has nearly doubled in the past 12 months.St Jude Medical shares fell 1.7 per cent to $41.21 after the stock’s rating was cut to “underperform” by RBC capital.
105;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2013-04-07T19:02:42Z;Copper price set to fall amid high output;;Copper production is rising at the fastest rate in a decade, prompting investors to bet on a price collapse.The price of copper is key to the profitability of the large mining companies such as BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Freeport McMoran, as well as for the economy of Chile, which derives more than one eighth of its GDP from the metal, and other countries such as Mongolia and Zambia.The inability of the world’s copper miners to boost production in response to soaring Chinese demand has been a key driver of the “super-cycle” of high prices and bumper profits for the mining industry over the past decade.But that trend has recently reversed, as miners’ investments in new supply begin to bear fruit. Copper output in Chile, which accounts for a third of global supply, has been rising strongly in recent months, boosted by the expansion of Escondida, the world’s largest copper mine. Wood Mackenzie, a leading consultancy, expects 2013 to see the biggest percentage increase in global mine production since 2004.Copper prices last week fell to an eight-month low of $7,331 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange. The price of the metal, used in everything from electrical wiring to air-conditioning units, is down 28 per cent from a record high in 2011. Nonetheless, almost all copper mines remain profitable at current prices, leading some to argue that prices could fall further.“A lot of the funds are beginning to see this situation where you’ve got a lot of supply finally coming through and demand is not looking that great,” said Richard Wilson, chairman of metals at Wood Mackenzie.The increase in copper supply will be the focus of Cesco week, the major annual gathering of the copper industry in Chile, which begins on Monday.It has helped to trigger a sharp increase in copper inventory, with stocks of copper at LME warehouses almost tripling since October.That has made many investors bearish: according to data on US contracts from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, investor positioning is the most bearish since 2009.Barclays, traditionally one of the most bullish banks on commodity prices, said that the rise in supply marked the “end of an era for the copper bulls”.Even so, traders believe the market may have become over-pessimistic in the short term as Chinese consumers, who account for 40 per cent of global copper demand, have become more optimistic in recent weeks.Stocks in warehouses around Shanghai – closely-watched by the market as an indicator of China’s need for copper – have fallen by some 50,000-100,000 tonnes in recent weeks, traders say.
106;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2013-03-24T22:41:34Z;Congo attack hits mineral transport halted after Congo attack;;The largest attack on Congo’s copper mining heartlands in more than a decade has brought provincial movements of minerals to a standstill and forced a night-time curfew in the provincial capital, Lubumbashi.The attack by 300 fighters drawn from a militia seeking independence for Katanga, Congo’s southern mining province, comes as the Kinshasa-based government of President Joseph Kabila is also trying to put down several rebellions in the east, where rebels over-ran the eastern capital, Goma, late last year.Mining companies stopped transporting minerals after the attack, said an expatriate worker based in the province. Glencore and Freeport-McMoRan are among those that have invested billions to develop Katanga’s copper and cobalt deposits.“[We] have to arrest them to see who’s behind them,” Moise Katumbi, governor of Katanga, told the Financial Times on Sunday, adding that the group had surrendered to a local UN peacekeeping force and that the situation was now under control. Residents said a 9pm-5am curfew had been imposed.Witnesses said attackers armed with Kalashnikovs, machetes and bows and arrows entered the town on Saturday, drawing machinegun fire from the army. Photographs seen by the FT showed several dead fighters on the streets of Lubumbashi. According to local estimates at least 35 people were killed in the fighting, said a UN statement.The militia, which the UN named as Mai Mai Kata Katanga (which means “Cut out Katanga” in Swahili) tried to draw on nationalist sentiment and disgruntlement with the Kinshasa-based government.Although the attack on Lubumbashi was ill-planned and underpowered – it included children thought to be under 15 years of age and the fighters had only 30 or so firearms – it was the culmination of three weeks of smaller attacks, say security experts.The UN said similar militias had displaced more than 300,000 people in the province since 2011. They have also been blamed for two armed attacks on the city airport in that period.“This is clearly another major blow for Katanga’s reputation, and Lubumbashi’s, as being safer and calmer than the rest of the country,” said Gregory Mthembu-Salter, a mining consultant who visited the province last month.As it carried out its attack the group carried a red, green and white independence flag recalling a breakaway movement which in 1960, helped by foreign mercenaries and Belgian mining interests, had enabled Katanga to secede from Congo for three years until it was put down by UN forces.“They expected the people to come out and greet them as heroes but no one followed them. If people wanted to support them they would go and loot the shops but nobody went to break anything. They don’t want to destabilise the unity of Congo – they want this province to go forward,” said Gov Katumbi, who played down the strength of the movement.Instead, 245 fighters surrendered to the UN, which has a peacekeeping base in Lubumbashi. The UN said it would hand the rebels over to state authorities, adding that 54 of those who surrendered were injured, 15 of them seriously. It said the city was “calm but tense” after their surrender.Katanga’s wealth is critical to the functioning of Congo, which is one of the world’s least developed countries despite its mineral wealth. Katangans also take leading roles in Congo’s Kinshasa-based government but the province remains under-developed and its people are frustrated that much of its mining wealth is diverted elsewhere.
107;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2013-02-06T07:35:42Z;Metals old boys’ club loses sole woman;LME highlights dearth of women in mining industry;"The London Metal Exchange is often called an “old boys’ club”.That description just became a little more apt: Bethan Wilde, the only female trader on the LME’s “ring”, is leaving the open outcry trading floor.Ms Wilde’s departure, first reported by Bloomberg, highlights how male-dominated the LME is. While there is one other woman who has been authorised by the LME to trade on the ring – out of about 100 traders in total – Ms Wilde was the only woman who engaged in the exchange’s shouting match on a daily basis.It was ever thus at the LME, which despite modernising rapidly in recent years still has something of the air of an old-fashioned gentlemen’s club. The dress code, although it no longer includes top hats, is strictly enforced. And until its sale to Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing last year, it was one of the last member-owned exchanges in the world.The classic Wolff’s Guide to the LME, first published in 1976, described ring traders as “young professionals – often unkindly referred to as ‘the barrow boys’ – with sharp reflexes [and] leather lungs”.Ms Wilde, 29, told the FT that she had “immensely enjoyed” working on the ring, where she specialised in aluminium trading. “It’s not a position that most women think about taking. It’s the nature of the business: trading on a floor and having to shout at people,” she said.The dearth of women is not limited to the trading floor. The LME’s new “user committee”, selected last month to “represent the interests and views of the exchange’s stakeholders”, is made up of 14 men.Indeed, the lack of women both in the ring and the boardroom reflects the fact that the metals industry in general continues to be almost entirely dominated by men.(On the Nymex floor, according to traders, there are three female traders: one in natural gas, one in platinum and one in oil options.)Although women run the commodities divisions of several of the largest banks in the commodities markets – Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank – none is a metals specialist.And among metals brokers, trading houses, miners and processors, there is only a handful of women at the most senior levels.Cynthia Carroll, the only woman to run a top mining company, is about to step down as chief executive of Anglo American. Elsewhere, Jacynthe Côté runs Rio Tinto’s aluminium business; Kathleen Quirk is chief financial officer of Freeport-McMoRan; and Anita Zeng runs Glencore’s office in China. Among exchanges, CME Group’s head of metals is Harriet Hunnable, while HKEx on Wednesday appointed Liz Milan of the LME to be its head of Asian commodities.“The broader metal market is tilted towards men, and the LME reflects that,” says Chris Evans, head of business development at the LME.The lack of women in the industry is a problem for metals companies seeking women with relevant experience to appoint to their boards. Of the seven companies on the FTSE 100 with all-male boards, five of them (Antofagasta, Glencore, Xstrata, Kazakhmys and Vedanta) are miners.Amanda Van Dyke, chair of Women in Mining, an organisation promoting women in the industry, says that just one in ten miners is a woman, with that figure dropping to one in twenty at the board level. “When you compound finance with metals and mining you get even less women,” she observes.Nonetheless, while the pace of change may to an outsider appear glacial, the industry is slowly becoming more open to women.“Hopefully women will be attracted to get more involved in the metals trade,” Ms Wilde says. “The LME still has got a bit of an old-school mentality but I think it definitely is changing.”“Now there are some women at the junior level,” adds one senior metals industry figure. “Thirty or 40 years ago there were no women at all.”The Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times"
108;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-12-07T18:37:03Z;Freeport boss richer but under attack;;"The two corporate incarnations of James “Jim Bob” Moffett, the veteran US oil and mining entrepreneur, have experienced widely varying fortunes this week.As chairman of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the world’s largest listed copper miner, he has had a terrible week. The company’s shares have fallen 19 per cent since Monday, as investors reacted with dismay to its deals to buy McMoRan Exploration and Plains Exploration and Production, two US oil companies, for a total of about $20bn including debt.As McMoRan Exploration’s chief executive, however, Mr Moffett’s week has been much more cheering. Its shares, battered by recent discouraging reports from its flagship Davy Jones well, have risen 96 per cent thanks to the Freeport bid.The good news for Mr Moffett, who owns about 4.97m shares in McMoRan and 3.08m in Freeport, is that he has come out about $15m ahead.That is not a life-changing amount for him; Freeport paid him $33.6m in 2010, cut to $22m last year after the company lost an advisory vote by shareholders on board remuneration.Even so, for Freeport shareholders who have seen almost $7bn wiped off the value of the company, it is a galling twist.Evy Hambro of BlackRock, the fund manager that controls about 11 per cent of Freeport’s equity, said on a call to discuss the deal on Wednesday that the management team had “chosen to break the trust with investors” by diversifying away from copper and gold into oil and gas.Mr Moffett’s response was to point to his record. It was the geological knowledge he had acquired from his background in oil and gas, he said, that had enabled Freeport to find Grasberg, the world’s largest recoverable copper and gold deposit, in 1988.“You guys have made a lot of money off the Grasberg . . . and off of many of the other discoveries,” Mr Moffett said.“So I hope you’re not going to be jumping to conclusions too quick without looking at the history of why we’ve been successful in the past.”Born in 1938 in Louisiana, and educated in Texas, Mr Moffett grew up in the heartland of oil.Raised in Houston by his mother, a single parent, he won a football scholarship to the University of Texas, where he studied geology. He was a first-class scholar as well as an athlete, according to the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, which gave him an award for “exceptional humanitarian contributions to society” in 2000.He worked in oil as a roustabout – a manual worker – and then as a geologist before forming McMoRan Oil and Gas in 1969. The 1981 merger with Freeport Minerals, which took him into mining, was followed by a complex series of deals. McMoRan Oil and Gas, the predecessor of McMoRan Exploration, was spun off in 1994, and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold emerged as the main listed company.The deals to buy Plains and bring McMoRan Exploration back into the fold, his latest examples of corporate reshuffling, may have received a terrible reception. But Mr Moffett is justified in saying that investors who had faith in him at the right time did very well. From a low below $4 in 2000, Freeport’s shares climbed more than tenfold to about $40 at the beginning of December.However, that rise coincided with a long upswing in the price of copper. Oil and gas prices, shaken by the US shale boom, seem unlikely to show a similar performance in the coming decade. Freeport’s shares rebounded a little on Friday, in a sign that the shock may have been wearing off. Still, for Mr Moffett, keeping his shareholders happy in the future looks like being more difficult than he has been used to."
109;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-12-07T14:46:31Z;Letter from Lex – Christmas shopping;;Some companies have started their Christmas shopping early. Baxter spent $4bn buying Swedish dialysis-product maker Gambro, but it was the world’s second biggest copper producer that really splashed the cash. Freeport-McMoRan spent $20bn on two oil exploration & production companies as it diversified into a new industry. That was not the only big oil or mining story. Repsol filed a $10.5bn arbitration request at the World Bank over Argentina’s expropriation of YPF. In mining, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich took a stake in Norilsk Nickel in an attempt to settle a long-running spat between two other Russian billionaires. In a separate dispute over commodities, Singapore threw its full weight behind trader Olam to fend off shortseller Muddy Waters.Others were also thinking about buying or selling. Cable & Wireless Communications could receive more than $1bn for its telecoms interests in eight islands from Bahrain’s Batelco while Singapore Airlines is looking to sell its 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic. US chipmaker Qualcomm decided to risk $120m by investing in struggling electronics maker Sharp while UK grocer Tesco made a long-overdue decision to withdraw from the US market. In the aerospace & defence sector three European nations raised their stakes in EADS while Rolls-Royce faced the possibility of prosecution over allegations of corruption and bribery in Indonesia and China. Meanwhile the world’s largest company by market capitalisation, Apple, experienced its worst share price decline in four years. Competitor Samsung elevated Jay Lee to vice-chairman in a further step towards one day taking overall control of the company.The banking sector was still preoccupied with fallout from the financial crisis and other scandals. Whistleblowers alleged that Deutsche Bank hid huge losses on derivatives during the height of the crisis to avoid a bailout while UBS was in talks with regulators about penalties for allegedly rigging the Libor benchmark. In the US, Citigroup cut 11,000 jobs while Bank of New York Mellon was drawn further into a dispute over Argentine bondholders. In the UK, banks are still at the mercy of populist politicians, who increased the levy on their balance sheets. At least one bank was looking elsewhere – Barclays agreed a deal to sell its African business to South Africa-based Absa.John Casey, Lex Publisher
110;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-12-07T07:03:26Z;Eighties rerun no party for Freeport investors;Share price has dropped 20% since energy deal was announced;“The two companies said their combined resources would greatly enhance the strength and growth prospects of both and would enable Freeport-McMoRan to become a substantial independent oil and gas company.”So reported the Financial Times in December 1980, when Freeport Minerals announced its merger with McMoRan Oil and Gas.This week, announcing its re-entry into oil and gas after spinning off its energy unit in 1994, Freeport-McMoRan’s chairman and founder James “Jim Bob” Moffett said the deal would “create a premier minerals and oil and gas business”, enabling the company to build value “through a much larger, well-capitalised platform”.The déjà vu doesn’t stop there. With miners such as BHP Billiton and Vedanta also investing in oil and gas, the mining sector increasingly resembles the oil industry of the 1970s and 1980s.Then, cash-rich oil majors such as Shell, BP and Exxon splashed out on mining assets in an attempt to diversify.But the deals were far from successful. For example, Shell bought Billiton in 1970, only to record a $170m loss when it sold it to Gencor of South Africa two decades later. BP exited the mining business in 1989, selling for $4.3bn a division in which it had invested about $6bn.Is Freeport making a similar strategic error? Its shareholders certainly think so. The share price has plunged almost 20 per cent since the deal was announced, and more than a fifth of the shares have changed hands.The problem is that investors hold Freeport’s shares because they want exposure to the copper market. As Evy Hambro, manager of BlackRock’s mining fund and one of Freeport’s largest investors, said: “Investors obviously have the freedom to diversify their own portfolios by commodity and by geography and don’t need management teams to do it for them.”With its return into oil and gas, Freeport has further narrowed the pool of equities available to investors seeking simple exposure to the mining industry. Indeed, assuming the deals now in the works go ahead, three of the world’s six largest listed mining companies – BHP Billiton, the combined Glencore and Xstrata, and Freeport – will have exposure to and ambitions in energy.Indeed, Mr Moffett and Richard Adkerson, currently chief executive of Freeport, both argued that pure exposure to a single commodity would be a benefit back in 1994, when the company spun off its copper and oil divisions into two separate companies.“You have two pure plays and banks can lend to each company,” Mr Moffett told the Times-Picayune. Mr Adkerson – who in 1994 was finance chief of Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold and chief executive of McMoRan Oil and Gas – said the spin-off had been “driven by a desire to create value for shareholders”.Shareholders have made clear that in reversing the spin-off, Freeport has done the opposite.The Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
111;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

114;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-12-05T21:45:19Z;Largest Apple share drop in four years;;Wall Street stocks were muted on Wednesday despite the sharpest single day sell-off in Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, in four years.Apple lost 6.4 per cent to $538.81 as the iPhone and iPad maker suffered its steepest decline since December 2008.Analysts attributed this week’s woes for the company’s shares – down almost 8 per cent from Monday – to a number of factors, including diminished expectations that Apple would issue a special dividend before the end of the year.Colin Gillis, tech analyst at BGC Partners, added that fresh data on forecast tablet sales for 2012 released on Wednesday showed that the company was facing stiffer competition from Google.He said: “With an expectation that the current line-up of Apple products will not be refreshed any time soon, investors are concerned about a product vacuum after the holidays. Competition is growing and there is no specific catalyst to provide upside to Apple’s stock at the moment.”The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.8 per cent to 2,973.70 as the tech-heavy benchmark was dragged down by Apple’s poor performance. Shares in Google were 0.5 per cent lower at $687.82.The S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher at 1,409.28. US equities held on to marginal gains as investors set aside worries over a lack of progress in US budget negotiations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 13,034.49.On Wednesday, President Barack Obama met business leaders to discuss his position on the fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax increases that could hurt the US economy. Earlier this week, Democrats rejected a counter-offer put forward by Republicans.“Despite the ongoing talks, there are still other positives coming out of the economy right now, including strong results from the housing sector,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade.“There seems to be a lot of underlying optimism in the economy and investors are hoping that government doesn’t hurt that by prolonging these discussions.”Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold fell heavily as the US mining group said it would move back into the oil business and acquire two companies for $20bn in a deal first reported in the Financial Times.Shares in Freeport fell 16 per cent to $32.16 as it said the takeovers valued the equity of Plains Exploration and Production at $6.9bn in cash and stock and McMoRan Exploration at about $3.4bn in cash. Plains shares rose 23.4 per cent to $44.50, while McMoRan Exploration shares jumped 87 per cent to $15.82.Facebook shares moved higher as Nasdaq OMX said the social networking site would be added to its Nasdaq 100 index.Shares in the company gained 0.9 per cent to $27.71. The move comes after Infosys, the Indian IT company, said it would shift the listing of its American depositary shares to the New York Stock Exchange last week.Shares in Pandora Media, the internet radio company, fell 17.5 per cent to $7.80 after it said lower advertising would widen its expected full-year losses late on Tuesday.Brian Nowak, analyst at Nomura, cut his price target for the company’s shares by 28.5 per cent to $5. He said: “If the ad environment is weakening, we would expect experimental ad dollars on new media, like Pandora, to be among the first cut.”Financial sector stocks were among the strongest performing industry group on the S&P 500, rising 1.3 per cent.The gains were led by Citigroup, the US bank, which said it would cut 11,000 jobs in an effort to lower costs. Shares in Citi gained 6.3 per cent to $36.46. Bank of America shares were close behind, moving 5.7 per cent higher to $10.46.Shares in Starbucks, the coffee chain retailer, fell 0.7 per cent to $50.79 as it announced plans to expand its presence in the Americas.The company said it is seeking to open 3,000 new stores in the region by 2017, with at least half those stores in the US.
115;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-12-05T21:43:27Z;Freeport returns to oil with $20bn deals;;Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold has engineered a dramatic re-entry to the oil business with two deals worth a total of about $20bn, buying Plains Exploration and Production and McMoRan Exploration.The deals will see the US mining group pay about $6.9bn in cash and stock for Plains, and about $2.1bn in cash for McMoRan Exploration, net of the 36 per cent of McMoRan Exploration already owned by Freeport and Plains. Freeport will also assume about $11bn in debt.Taken together the moves will create the fifth-largest natural resources company in the US and the fifth-largest mining company in the world, the companies said.Freeport investors punished the company for the deal, sending shares down 14 per cent in early trading. McMoRan Exploration stock was up 86 per cent and Plains shares rose 26 per cent.The move will take Freeport back to its roots as an energy producer and mark a major shift in strategy for the company, creating a natural resources conglomerate with a major foothold in the Gulf of Mexico.James “Jim Bob” Moffett, chairman of Freeport and chief executive of McMoRan Exploration, has long considered reuniting mining and oil and gas operations under one company, following the 1994 split of McMoRan Exploration from Freeport.The tie-up will connect three companies that already know each other well. Mr Moffett for years has both chaired the Freeport board and been chief executive of McMoRan Exploration. Those two companies share an office building in New Orleans. Plains owns more than 30 per cent of McMoRan Exploration, and Plains chief executive James Flores and general counsel John Wombwell sit on the board.The merged company will make about 74 per cent of next year’s earnings before interest, depreciation and tax from mining and the remainder from oil and gas.Plains has oilfields in California and the Eagle Ford shale of Texas, and last month bought a package of fields and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico from BP for $5.5bn. Plains’ acquisition of the BP assets was not the catalyst for the Freeport deal, but made the assets more attractive, according to people familiar with the matter.About 48 per cent of the merged group’s ebitda will come from North America, giving Freeport diversification away from its troubled Indonesian copper mines.McMoRan Exploration, an oil and gas company that was spun out of Freeport in 1994, has been pioneering drilling at extreme depths below sea level in the shallow waters of the gulf. The technique has not yet yielded commercially attractive results but is believed to offer great potential for future production.The terms of the Plains offer are 0.6531 Freeport shares and $25 in cash, worth a total of about $50, for every Plains share, representing a 39 per cent premium to the Plains closing price on Tuesday night.The McMoRan Exploration offer is $14.75 in cash and 1.15 units of a new royalty trust for every McMoRan share. The royalty trust will hold a 5 per cent overriding royalty interest in future production from McMoRan’s ultra-deep oilfields. The cash alone offers a premium of 74 per cent to McMoRan Exploration’s share price on Tuesday night, or 31 per cent to its average over the past month.Credit Suisse advised Freeport’s special committee, while Wachtell Lipton provided legal counsel. Evercore advised the special committee of McMoRan Exploration, while Weil Gotshal provided counsel. Barclays advised Plains, while Latham & Watkins provided counsel. Freeport received $9.5bn in financing from JPMorgan Chase. Cravath advised JPMorgan in arranging the financing.
116;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-12-05T20:57:35Z;Freeport-McMoRan – paying the price;A large part of the appeal is the low US political risk profile;When you slap two risks together, is the total risk the sum of the two (addition, for those who slept in class) or the product (multiplication)? Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold is about to find out. The miner is pairing the risks of diversifying into a new industry – oil and gas – with those inherent in paying big premiums for acquisitions.The US copper and gold miner said on Wednesday it would spend $20bn on two oil exploration and production companies with operations in the US and the Gulf of Mexico: $16bn in cash, stock and assumed debt for Plains Exploration & Production, and $4bn in cash and stock for McMoRan Exploration (where Freeport chairman James “Jim Bob” Moffett is chief executive). The premiums are 39 per cent and 74 per cent, respectively. No wonder Freeport’s shares crashed 15 per cent.Why would it pay above the odds to diversify away from a business in which it has done well? Freeport’s shares have returned nearly 600 per cent in the decade before the deal was announced. The world’s second biggest copper producer by output may simply be bearish on copper prices, which have risen 380 per cent over that same decade. The supply-demand picture is firm now, with copper inventories hitting lows in the third quarter. But a soft Chinese economy, and miners’ readiness to go ahead with new projects, makes the long-term outlook drearier.The deal’s other appeal is the low political risk profile of US assets, which may let executives and investors sleep soundly at night in ways that Indonesian, African and South American mines do not. But the biggest danger to Freeport’s new venture is American too: the impact of newly accessible US shale oil on global prices. That will depend on how voters and regulators treat hydraulic fracturing, the technology that frees shale oil. Political risk comes in many flavours.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
117;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-12-05T02:30:46Z;Freeport plans return to energy;;Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold is planning big acquisitions in the oil and gas sector, a multibillion-dollar move that would take the US mining group back to its roots as an energy producer, according to several people familiar with the matter.Freeport is poised to buy a large oil and gas group and McMoRan Exploration, potentially snatching up two publicly traded companies that operate oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, these people said.The deals would mark a change in strategy for Freeport, creating a natural resources conglomerate likely to be worth close to $50bn, including debt.The smaller of the two deals is likely to see Freeport acquire McMoRan Exploration, an oil and gas company that was spun out of Freeport in 1994 and has an equity value of $1.4bn.The companies have kept close ties since their split. James “Jim Bob” Moffett is chairman of Freeport, and chairman and chief executive of McMoRan Exploration. Freeport and McMoRan Exploration also share an office building in New Orleans.Freeport is also expected to buy another larger, oil and gas company with assets in the Gulf. One person suggested the larger target had close ties with Freeport executives and could be worth about $10bn, including debt.Freeport has links with Plains Exploration and Production, which recently bought oil and gasfields in the Gulf from BP. Plains also owns a 31.5 per cent stake in McMoRan Exploration while James Flores, chief executive of Plains, sits on the board of McMoRan Exploration.Freeport is the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer but was once a diversified conglomerate with substantial oil and gas operations, before selling those assets to focus on mining. Freeport reported revenues of $4.4bn for the three months to September 30.Freeport’s copper operations generate ample cash, said an industry expert, and the miner has been looking for ways to reinvest profitably. However, expanding the company’s copper operations could increase the group’s exposure at a time when ailing economic growth in China and a series of large new copper projects are dampening the outlook for the price of the metal. The miner’s management has long been interested in oil and gas, another industry source added.However, industry observers said that the deals could surprise some shareholders. The biggest global mining groups have come under pressure to return money to shareholders, rather than invest excess funds in ambitious new projects.Freeport in October reported weaker than expected third-quarter earnings, as the recovery in production and sales at its Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia proceeded slower than expected. The miner was also forced to halt operations at Grasberg last year due to strikes and suffered labour problems at its Cerro Verde mine in Peru.Freeport, Plains and McMoRan Exploration declined to comment.Additional reporting by Ed Crooks
118;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-10-23T18:50:56Z;Copper bears predict impending surplus;The days of the red metal’s scarcity could be nearing an end;"China’s slowing economy could spell the end of copper’s long price rise, combined as it is with rising supply of the metal.Perhaps more than any other commodity, the red metal is emblematic of the decade-long supercycle in commodities prices driven by China’s spectacular growth. Even as other metals have wilted this year, copper prices have stayed high.But a growing number of analysts and traders believe the days of copper’s decade-long scarcity could be coming to an end.“This seems to be something of an inflection point for copper,” says David Lilley, co-founder of Red Kite, a leading metals hedge fund and physical trading house. “The biggest consumer is struggling, and miners are beginning to pick up production.”The International Copper Study Group, an intergovernmental organisation, expects the copper market to be oversupplied by 458,000 tonnes next year – the highest such “surplus” recorded by the ICSG since 2001.Other analysts, traders and mining executives agree that balance of supply and demand is likely to become less strained in the next year or two. Mike Henry, who manages BHP Billiton’s sales of commodities, says the copper market “is likely to be more in balance over the next couple of years than it has been for some time”, although he adds that “the fundamentals of the industry are still strong”.Many came away from the LME week gathering of the metals industry expecting prices to grind lower from current levels just below $8,000 a tonne – although few expect an imminent collapse.If the period of oversupply is sustained, prices could fall lower still, reversing an era of stellar profits for miners such as Freeport-McMoRan and Antofagasta and undermining the economies of large producers such as Chile and Peru.The Chinese slowdown is one important reason for the shift. The country, which accounts for 40 per cent of global copper demand, is moving to a slower, less investment-fuelled phase of growth, making a repeat of the gangbuster years of the early 2000s – when Chinese copper demand grew by as much as 30 per cent in a year – unlikely.Max Layton, metals analyst at Goldman Sachs, says the weakness of the Chinese property industry could lead to a sharp slowdown in building completions late next year, creating “significant downside risk to copper prices in late 2013”.But the most striking shift in the copper market is the rise in mine supply. The apparent inability of the mining industry to raise output has been almost as important as Chinese demand in underpinning high copper prices over the past decade.Now, however, miners are responding. Production from Chile, the world’s top supplier, was up 7.8 per cent year-on-year in the three months to August, according to Cochilco, the state copper commission. The ICSG predicts mined supply of copper will increase by 6.4 per cent next year – the biggest rise since the mid-1990s.“There’s no question that copper supply is on the way up,” says Mark Hansen, global head of metals at Noble Group, the Hong Kong-based trading house. “We could reasonably expect 5 per cent growth next year.”The expectations of more plentiful mine supplies have been reflected in the physical market for copper ore, known as “concentrates”. Smelters are likely to be able to charge higher prices to miners in annual contracts for next year, in an indication of more plentiful supplies, says Peter Willbrandt, chief executive of Aurubis, Europe’s largest copper smelter.“The concentrates market will be more balanced or even in surplus next year,” he says. “We have had tough times in the smelting industry for five years. Now more and more new mines are coming on stream; existing mines are doing well.”Even some of the most traditionally bullish investment banks have toned down their forecasts. Barclays recently said the market could see a “copper-bottomed supply response at last”, concluding that “the tailwind that copper has had for the past six to seven years is starting to abate”. And Goldman is recommending that miners “strongly consider” hedging against a fall in prices.But not everyone believes the copper bull market is over just yet. Crucially, they say, the bears have become over-optimistic about the prospects for mine supply.“How many times have we heard this?” says Jim Lennon of Macquarie. The Australian bank says “pullbacks to supply projects will be the commodity story over the next six months”.Indeed, just this week Freeport-McMoRan pared expectations for its huge Grasberg mine in Indonesia next year.In London last week, Chilean and Peruvian mining executives expressed scepticism about many of the projects slated to start production in the next few years, noting that in some cases there were development problems and in others owners were slowing investment.“If all the projects were coming on stream as announced, we were expecting a surplus from 2014 for five years,” says Diego Hernández, chief executive of Antofagasta, the London-listed Chilean copper miner. Now, though, he expects that after a short period of surplus, the market will return to balance from 2015.“We are still optimistic in the medium and long term because supply and demand will continue to be tight.”"
119;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-10-16T10:23:57Z;Copper – keeping up with demand;The dynamics of Chinese demand, monetary easing and supply;"China’s fascination with resource-rich Africa’s treasure knows no bounds. If the metal is red, so much the better: China is the world’s biggest consumer of copper. Last week Discovery Metals, whose main asset is a copper mine in Botswana, brushed off a US$850m offer from private equity group Cathay Fortune. The Australian exploration company wisely left the door open for a higher offer. It must recall the generosity of Minmetals Resources, which paid C$1.3bn in February for Toronto-listed Anvil Mining, a miner in Democratic Republic of Congo.Copper has recovered from its midyear funk to trade around $8,100 a tonne. One reason for this resilience when demand is subdued is that liquid stocks of the metal hit a historic low (put at 2.6 weeks of consumption, by IntierraRMG) in the third quarter. But copper’s price is not just a bet on Chinese demand – or monetary easing programmes.Supply – constrained by weather, earthquakes, permits and declining grades from old mines – also plays a part. The spat between Anglo American and Codelco did not affect supply but labour disruption in Chile did. The world’s top 10 mines produced 600,000t fewer of copper last year than in 2010, Rio Tinto notes. It expects mine closures to cut copper output by 1.8mt in the next five years and declining grades by a further 1.6mt. In other words 3.4mt of new production, equivalent to a fifth of this year’s output, will be required to stand still.Demand in the longer term will be supported by growing electrification in emerging markets in Asia, and motor industry growth in China and India. The outlook emboldened some miners (Anglo, Rio and Xstrata) to go ahead with projects; others (BHP Billiton) slowed them, amid fears of a looming glut. Either way, investors should prefer names with access to high-grade ore and lower cash costs. Wood Mackenzie data put Rio, Freeport-McMoRan and BHP Billiton at the low end of the cost curve. New projects for Xstrata could reshuffle the pack. As ever, the real winners will be those suppliers that best gauge demand.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
120;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-09-05T07:20:25Z;Commodity traders eye distressed assets;The weak market is offering hidden opportunities;"The slump in metals prices could turn out to be a blessing in disguise for some of the world’s largest commodities houses. The trader-cum-producers are vulture buyers that use periods of stress to snap up assets on the cheap.True, low commodities prices will hurt them in the short term. First, their profitability of production assets declines; second, weaker prices reduce the profits of trading. Yet, a weak market does provide a hidden opportunity.Glencore is one of the traders that could profit, and others, including Vitol and Gunvor in energy, are already moving to snap up distressed assets cheaply. Thus, the current slump could help traders expand their fixed asset holdings, helping them move away from their reliance on the middleman business model.Glencore’s experience in the global financial crisis in 2008 is a case in point. Ivan Glasenberg, the 55-year-old South African chief executive, used the sharp drop in copper and other metals prices to purchase stakes in miners running out of cash or struggling to raise finance in the capital market or the banking sector.The trader’s 2008 booty includes some of its most promising assets, such as copper and cobalt mines like Katanga in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Now Glencore is once again circling assets in trouble. For example, the trader is likely to underwrite a rights issue by Australian miner Straits Resources. It is also looking at an aluminium smelter in trouble in Italy owned by Alcoa.If the $70bn merger between Glencore and Xstrata falls through, expect the trader to concentrate in the next few months on acquiring medium and small-sized miners in financial trouble, rather than targeting global miners such as, say, Anglo American and Freeport-McMoRan.Other commodities traders have already captured several prey as the market weakens. Swiss-based Vitol and Gunvor have used the crisis in the oil refining sector earlier this year to buy several large refineries previously owned by Petroplus, the bankrupt Swiss-based refiner, at minimal values.The trend is set to gain pace if commodities prices remain weak because slow economic growth in China and the capital market remains firmly shut. If the financial pain is high enough, some natural resources companies could end up knocking at the door of the commodities trading house for help. If so, the traders could emerge from the current slump with a good collection of assets.The Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times"
121;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-07-24T12:15:15Z;Indonesian mining: Intrepid knocked by new partner intervention;;"Prospecting for gold in emerging markets is never straightforward. But even veterans at Australia’s Intrepid Mines got an unpleasant surprise last Thursday morning when representatives of new investors landed by helicopter at its large mine site in Indonesia, asserted their ownership, and sent all the workers home.“This is one of the world’s best undeveloped copper and gold projects and the biggest exploration project in Indonesia,” Brad Gordon, Intrepid’s chief executive, told beyondbrics. “This was a complete shock to us.”The dispute, which saw the junior miner’s Australia and Canada listed shares tumble by more than 50 per cent on Monday, will add to the growing uncertainty looming over the mining sector in Indonesia, which has been hit by a new wave of resource nationalism and legal uncertainty.Major international mining groups like Freeport McMoRan, which operates one of the world’s largest copper and gold mines in Papua, and Newmont are holding off on multi-billion dollar new investments until they have re-negotiated their terms with the government.Another junior miner, UK-listed Churchill Mining, recently brought an international arbitration claim against the Indonesian government for damages, alleging that it was forced out of a $1.8bn coal project by well-connected local investors.Gordon said that Intrepid’s problems are different as it is in dispute with its Indonesian joint venture partners rather than the government.The mining licences for Intrepid’s Tujuh Bukit project in eastern Java are held by an Indonesian company called Indo Multi Niaga. It has a cooperation agreement with Intrepid that gives it an 80 per cent economic interest in the project.Intrepid recently discovered that new shareholders had taken control of IMN and Gordon says the new investors flew to the mine site on Thursday to send more than 600 workers home.Beyondbrics was unable to reach IMN’s original or new shareholders for comment.With $95m already invested, and the project still at least 30 months from entering production, Intrepid and its investors have much to lose.“In 2010, we were the second-best performer on the Australian Securities Exchange so we’ve gone from market darlings to zero,” said Gordon, with the company’s market capitalisation now equivalent to its cash position, giving no value to its Indonesian project. “The signs aren’t good but we’ll do our best to engage with the new shareholders to come to an amicable solution.”The latest dispute involving a foreign miner in Indonesia will do little to reassure investors.Related reading:

122;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-07-19T17:46:48Z;Freeport cuts outlook as metals prices fall;Large miners face squeeze on margins;Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s second-largest copper miner, reduced its production outlook for the year as falling metals prices, lower ore grades and higher costs weighed on the group’s second-quarter results.Freeport, which has struggled with strikes at its Grasberg mine in Indonesia, reported net income of $710m for the quarter, down 49 per cent from $1.4bn last year.The group lowered its full-year outlook for production of copper and gold, despite the recovery in production after work stoppages at Grasberg in the first quarter of the year.US-based Freeport now expects to sell 3.6bn pounds of copper and 1.1m ounces of gold this year.The company attributed the reduced numbers to “mine sequencing changes and slower underground ramp-up at PT Freeport Indonesia”.Large mining companies are facing a squeeze on margins, as slowing Chinese growth lowers demand for commodities such as copper, coal and iron ore after years of booming prices, while costs are rising quickly.Freeport achieved provisional pricing for its copper output of $3.53 per pound in the second quarter, down from $4.22 last year.This year’s costs could be higher than expected, at $1.47 per pound of copper, because of a lower offset to costs from sales of gold and molybdenum, used as an alloy because of its heat resistance. In the quarter, cash costs, net of such credits, were $1.49 per pound of copper, up from $0.93 in 2011.The shares rose 5 per cent to $34.68 in mid-afternoon trading, after the numbers came in above Wall Street analysts’ expectations.Like other large miners, such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, Freeport is facing calls to justify its plans for capital expenditure. The company expects to spend about $4bn this year, $2.5bn of which is on new projects.On a call with analysts, one shareholder questioned Richard Adkerson, chief executive, about the spending plans, adding that he did not want to “feel subordinate” to capital expenditure.“We will be very disciplined about projects,” said Mr Adkerson. He had previously highlighted the company’s ability to adjust its spending plans if the environment deteriorated.“When I look at our set of assets, we have an ability to [adjust] that is better than many others in the industry,” he said. “We can defer some of these projects if we have to without losing them.”Freeport’s revenues fell 23 per cent to $4.5bn in the second quarter, despite copper sales in the quarter coming in above some expectations at 927m pounds, down from 1bn pounds. Some analysts argue that as the largest copper mines globally, including Grasberg as well as Escondida and Collahuasi in Chile, recover from labour difficulties and weather disruptions experienced last year, the additional supply could weigh on prices for the metal.The company said operations at Grasberg, which ranks among the three largest copper mines in the world, were “approaching normal levels”.
123;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-05-18T21:04:41Z;Resource stocks mirror global economy;;Facebook’s flotation on the US stock market was an entertaining distraction from what has been the worst week for equities this year.As crowds cheered the social media company’s listing on Friday, something more unsettling was happening in an earthier realm. Energy and materials stocks have fallen 9.9 per cent and 10.6 per cent this month, respectively, outpacing the broader S&P 500 index’s decline of 7.4 per cent.The declines of the two industry groups involved in supplying essential raw materials for business show how investors really feel about the direction of the global economy. In short: it looks like slowing down. The share moves also challenge the thesis that a resilient US economy will insulate its stock market from Europe’s unfolding debt crisis.While headquartered and listed in the US, many energy and materials stocks are deeply dependent on economic activity elsewhere and supply commodities largely priced on global markets. ExxonMobil sells two-thirds of its products overseas. So does Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the mining titan.So when the rest of the world gets tired – or in the case of Europe, relapses into fever – US investors are not immune from the effects.China last week reported much weaker industrial activity, retail spending and investment in the world’s leading source of incremental raw materials demand. Caterpillar on Thursday unnerved shareholders when it said sales growth of its earthmoving machinery had slowed, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, sending its shares down 4.4 per cent. China consumes 40 per cent of the world’s copper.Then there is Europe. Amid debate over Greece’s future in the eurozone, analysts have been walking through worst-case scenarios. Bank of America Merrill Lynch argues a messy eurozone break-up could wipe another 2m barrels a day from Europe’s weakening oil demand and push Brent down to $60 a barrel. The oil benchmark was trading at $107 on Friday, having lost $20 since March as doubts have grown over global demand.Executives in the world of materials and commodities appear divided about the outlook. Richard Adkerson, chief executive of Freeport-McMoRan, last month told analysts that markets were “very positive” and China’s “fundamental economy appears to be strong”. Freeport’s shares have lost 17 per cent this month.Alberto Weisser, chief executive of New York-listed Bunge, one of the world’s biggest food traders with operations spanning the globe, told a Financial Times panel in New York this week he believed the euro “will stay together. In typical European fashion they will let it go to the cliff, and at the last moment they will do something”.As for China, where Bunge is a leading soyabean importer, Mr Weisser is not worried: “When we talk about 8 per cent growth as a ‘hard landing’, I think that’s a little bit strange.” Bunge’s shares slid with the market in May.Others are pessimistic – even in the US. As Dan DiMicco, chief executive of steelmaker Nucor, told investors last month: “Let’s be completely honest with ourselves. The US economy is not on the path of sustainable and healthy recovery from a Great Recession that began almost four years ago.”The US stock market is still in positive territory for the year, while European indices are in the red. Some strategists are convinced this pullback is more psychology than substance. “It’s somewhat frustrating to me that investors are reading about the doldrums in Europe and knocking US stocks down accordingly,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. He sees the S&P 500 at 1,450 by the year end, up double digits in percentage terms from today.But the performance of materials and energy, two of the S&P’s 10 sectors, shows how any US rebound in 2012 must overcome problems elsewhere.As Wall Street obsesses over Facebook’s listing, millions of users have embraced the company as a social network linking everyone around the world. The companies that supply oil and raw materials to the world face a different set of dynamics. The looming slowdown gives investors every reason to be concerned.
124;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-05-13T16:23:33Z;Tax spurs Indonesia mine investor fears;;Indonesia’s announcement of a new tax on mineral exports helped demonstrate why foreign investors have been wary of investing in the country’s rich mineral resources.The government this month finally laid out the details of a 20 per cent tax on exports of unprocessed metals, including nickel, tin and gold. Companies without plans to build processing facilities onshore will be banned from exporting.The confusion surrounding the new taxes – set after weeks of conflicting proposals and public comments from ministers – reinforces Indonesia’s reputation for regulatory uncertainty at a time when the country is courting foreign investment. Ministers had initially suggested that the tax could be as high as 50 per cent.Analysts say that tax will hit hardest the country’s smaller and newer miners, rendering some mines unprofitable and driving up the cost of nickel for buyers, particularly those from China who have come to rely heavily on Indonesia.Most larger companies, including Newmont and Freeport-McMoRan, will not be affected because they hold long-term contracts that the new rule cannot change.“There’s no intention to kill the mining companies, for sure,” says Jero Wacik, Indonesia’s energy minister, when announcing the tax.But the measures could reinforce a reluctance on the part of global miners to invest in Indonesia – and other countries that chop and change rules regarding mining operations.“Resource nationalism of this type discourages investment, poses a serious barrier to the exploration and development of new mineral deposits around the world, and is another reason why we see long-term constraints to gold supply,” says Tye Burt, chief executive of gold miner Kinross.As Karsten Fuelster of the International Finance Corporation in Jakarta says: “Would you want to do a multibillion-dollar investment in a mine project if you don’t have certainty over what the governing regulation is going to be?”Only 5 per cent of the industry’s exploration spending last year went to the Pacific region, including Indonesia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, down from 7 per cent in 2010, according to Metals Economics Group.Regulatory uncertainty and outbreaks of violence, such as sporadic attacks on Freeport-McMoRan’s Grasberg mine in Indonesia’s far east, meant few miners decided to enter the region, “despite [its] high prospectivity for gold, copper and nickel”, MEG says in its report.Indonesia also recently said that companies must divest majority control of their mines within 10 years of starting production, and are discussing new rules limiting exports of coal.“As a junior miner today trying to raise money for an outstanding highly prospective tenement in Indonesia it would be harder than it was a year or so ago,” says Owen Hegarty, vice-chairman of G-Resources Group, a Hong Kong-listed gold miner with operations in Indonesia. “That doesn’t mean its impossible.”The debate reflects the challenge facing regulators from Chile to Australia as they balance the growth of the mining industry with the demands from citizens and governments for a greater share of that success.Mining has in recent years contributed 4-5 per cent of Indonesian economic output, according to PwC. But its share in some areas is much higher and many of Indonesia’s regions richest in minerals, such as Papua, home of the Grasberg mine, are among the poorest in the country.Indonesian regulators “tend to make very big statements and then they pull back on certain things. There is an awareness that there is a need for foreign investors and there is a lack of local capital to develop the mining industry,” says one Singapore-based lawyer. “That balancing going on is … a learning process for them.”The tax is expected to hurt smaller, private sector miners who predominantly export to China for the production of nickel pig iron, a nickel substitute used in making stainless steel. About 55 per cent of China’s nickel ore imports came from Indonesia last year, according to Macquarie Securities.However, Chinese nickel producers have been stockpiling ore in recent months, anticipating export restrictions, lessening the impact on prices. Nickel is down about 8 per cent this year, trading close to two-year lows.“We have not yet seen any movement in the price of Indonesian nickel ore, suggesting that the miners may be taking the hit,” says Colin Hamilton, analyst at Macquarie. “But we expect there to be some pain-sharing and the tax could increase the volatility in nickel prices between the top and bottom of the cycle.”Lucky Ariesandi, an analyst with Kim Eng Securities in Jakarta says: “The margin for [nickel miners] with the highest profit is 40-50 per cent, the cost [of the new tax] is 20 per cent …There will be some miners with lower profitability that cannot make money if they bear the cost themselves. I think the Chinese buyers will have to bear the cost.”
125;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-04-24T17:30:27Z;Trafigura predicts dip for copper prices;;Softer than expected demand in China could push copper prices to as low as $7,000 per tonne by the end of the second quarter or the start of the third quarter, according to Trafigura, a leading metals and oil trading company.Simon Collins, head of dry bulk commodities at Trafigura, said that, although he was positive about the outlook for the metal in the long run, uncertainty over short term demand in the world’s largest copper consumer had led to high price volatility in the commodities markets in recent months.His comments, at the Financial Times Global Commodity Summit in Lausanne, came as Alberto Calderón, chief executive of aluminium, nickel and corporate development at leading miner BHP Billiton, told the same conference earlier on Tuesday that the long-term outlook for copper remained “strong” due to falling ore grades and shortfalls in supply, and growing Chinese demand.Mr Calderón added that economic expansion and rising incomes in China would be positive for its copper, potash, oil and gas. “China’s growth story has a long way to go,” he said.Used to produce electric cables for infrastructure and housing as well as consumer electronics, copper usage and its price is seen as a bellwether for the global economy. The metal is also important for the profitability of blue-chip miners such as BHP, Freeport-McMoRan, Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Xstrata, and commodities traders including Glencore and Trafigura.David Lilley, co-founder of Red Kite Capital Management, a leading metal hedge fund, said Chinese demand had been “disappointing” compared to expectations.However, he did not expect the copper price to fall far below the $8000 per tonne level as the copper price was supported by the unexpected strength in US economic growth.The copper market has seen factors which should have been supportive for prices in the past year. Labour disputes in leading copper mines in Peru and Indonesia have disrupted production, affecting supply levels, while the erosion in ore quality and the sharp increase in the cost of production has, in theory, lifted the price floor for the red metal.However, benchmark copper prices on the London Metal Exchange have dropped below $8,000 a tonne for the first time since January. On Tuesday, prices firmed 1.4 per cent to $8,152 a tonne in London afternoon trading.Mr Collins said he was negative on aluminium due to the oversupply in the market. Although worries about oversupply had weighed on zinc prices recently, the long term outlook for the metal was stronger due to the lack of new projects due to come online in the future.Twitter: @ftcommodities
126;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-04-19T12:55:40Z;Bulging Chinese inventories undermine copper;;There is more copper in China than at any other time in history – and economic growth in the world’s largest consumer of the metal is slowing. The combination of those two facts has cast a pall over the usually bullish mood at Cesco week in Santiago, the largest annual gathering of the world’s copper miners, traders, consumers and investors.“The general mood is not good,” says Gonzalo Sánchez, vice president for sales and marketing at Antofagasta, the Chilean copper miner. Or, as Michael Widmer, head of metals research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, puts it, “one of the most depressing Cesco weeks ever”.The price of copper is seen as a bellwether for the global economy thanks to its widespread use by the manufacturing industry. Copper is also important for the profitability of blue-chip miners such as BHP Billiton, Freeport-McMoRan, Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Xstrata, and traders including Glencore and Trafigura.Already, benchmark copper prices on the London Metal Exchange have dropped 7 per cent since the start of the month, dipping below $8,000 a tonne for the first time since January. Many are expecting the metal to test $7,500 or even $7,000 in the next few months.The reason is straightforward: after a dramatic buying spree at the end of last year, China is groaning with copper inventories.“We are definitely at the highest level of stocks in China ever,” says Paul Settles, principal copper consultant at CRU, a consultancy. He reckons there is just over 3m tonnes of copper in China, including the government’s strategic stocks, an increase of 918,000 tonnes in the past six months.That means Chinese imports of refined copper, or cathode, one of the most closely watched datapoints in the copper market, are likely to slow from the record 1m tonnes in the first quarter of the year as the country, which accounts for 40 per cent of global copper demand, works off inventories.“Rightly or wrongly, cathode imports into China are seen as a bellwether,” says Richard Wilson, chairman of metals at Wood Mackenzie.Estimating that China needs to import only another 1.7m tonnes in the rest of the year, he sees a “substantial” drop in imports in the coming months. “The market being the market, that will be viewed very negatively.”The large increase in Chinese inventories has coincided with a wave of broader macroeconomic concerns and a fresh bout of fears over Europe to unnerve investors.“The thing that has rattled people is not just that we’ve had a slowdown in China, but that it has come at a time when there is some political uncertainty as well,” says Robert Lind, chief economist at Anglo American. “In the short term, this could lead to continuing volatility.”But, echoing a widely held view among miners and traders, he says that investors have become too pessimistic. “China’s demand for commodities should remain very strong, underpinning higher real prices in the medium term than we’ve seen historically.”Indeed, few miners in Santiago this week were concerned by the prospect of a “hard landing” for the Chinese economy. Diego Hernández, chief executive of the largest copper miner Codelco, conceded that the market could see some “volatility” in the next 2-3 months but predicted that after that the tight supply-demand balance would prevail.Moreover, not everyone views the rise in Chinese stocks as a reason to be bearish. The rise in Chinese stocks has come at the expense of the rest of the world. Since September, inventories at London Metal Exchange warehouses have almost halved, falling to the lowest level since the financial crisis.Outside the exchange, executives say companies are holding very low levels of inventory due to the challenge of financing it.Indeed, Mr Settles of CRU estimates that 58 per cent of the world’s refined copper is now being held in China – the largest proportion on record. Traders say that China may hold as much as three quarters of the “spare” stock that is actually available to the market.“On its own the high stocks in China is bearish. But it has only made things tighter in the rest of the world,” he says.Indeed, the LME market has witnessed a scramble for metal in the past few days as traders seek to acquire physical metal from the exchange.The rush for delivery on Tuesday pushed the price of copper for immediate delivery to $114 a tonne above copper for delivery in three months – the highest such “backwardation” since September 2008, and a traditional sign of a tight market.“If there’s a strong second half in China and they eat up all those stocks, and the rest of the world doesn’t go to hell in a handbasket, we’re heading to a very tight market some time in the second half of this year and the first half of next year,” says Mr Settles.Or as one senior industry executive puts it: “You could say the Chinese have just cornered the copper market.”
127;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-04-18T18:36:53Z;Codelco chief bullish on copper prices;;Copper prices could fall 10 per cent in the short term due to high inventories in China, according to the world’s largest miner of the metal. But Codelco still painted a bullish outlook for the rest of the year, anticipating a “tight” market.Diego Hernández, chief executive of the state-owned Chilean miner, said in an interview with the Financial Times that the red metal would trade between $7,000 and $8,800 this year, compared with current prices of $8,010 a tonne.The views of Codelco are closely watched in the industry as the company, with a tenth of the world’s mine copper production and a large network of traders, has a privileged view of the state of global supply and demand.Copper prices are seen as a bellwether for the global economy thanks to its widespread use in by the manufacturing industry. Copper is also critical for the profitability of blue-chip miners such as BHP Billiton, Freeport-McMoRan, Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Xstrata and traders including Glencore and Trafigura.Mr Hernández’s prediction encapsulates a mood of nervousness that has pervaded the annual Cesco week gathering of the copper industry in Santiago, as traders and investors fear that Chinese companies could step back from the market after a buying spree in the past five months. Benchmark copper prices on the London Metal Exchange have fallen more than 7 per cent since the beginning of the month.Mr Hernández’s prediction for prices was slightly more bullish than six months ago, when he said that copper would trade between $6,600 and $8,800 in 2012. Since then copper consumption in both Europe and the US has improved, traders say.The head of Codelco rebuffed fears among some Western investors that slowing growth in China could lead to a deeper correction for copper, saying that any “volatility” – a miners’ euphemism for falling prices – was likely to be shortlived.“There is a concern and we are seeing some volatility on price for the short term,” he said. “But we believe after 2-3 months the supply-demand trend will prevail.”Copper prices fell $6,635 in October amid fears for the eurozone economy, but rebounded quickly as central banks injected liquidity, and Chinese traders bought.Mr Hernández’s view was echoed by other mining executives in Santiago, who expressed confidence that Chinese economic growth, albeit at a lower rate than in recent years, would continue to support commodities demand. China reported GDP growth of 8.1 per cent for the first quarter of this year, the slowest since 2009 and the government has announced a full-year target of 7.5 per cent.Andrew Harding, head of copper for Rio Tinto, said 7.5-8 per cent was a “strong number” for Chinese growth. “I am a fervent believer that the Chinese have control of their economy,” he said.Nonetheless, investors have become bearish about copper’s short-term prospects because a sharp increase in Chinese inventories in the first three months of 2012. Stocks at Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses have more than doubled to more than 200,000 tonnes, and unreported stocks at so-called “bonded warehouses” have surged to more than 600,000 tonnes, according to traders’ estimates.Mr Hernández predicted that copper demand would continue to outstrip supply until at least mid-2014, when planned new projects would in theory be sufficient to meet demand. But he warned that “not all those projects will be executed according to announcements”. The copper industry has suffered over the past five years from rampant cost inflation and significant delays at key projects.

The benchmark US index has now risen 11 per cent in the year to date. The financial sector – led by JPMorgan, which reached its highest mark since May – climbed 3.9 per cent on the day, clearly outpacing other groups, and is up more than 18 per cent for the year.Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs recorded gains of larger than six per cent each on the day. Shares in those major banks also reached multi-month highs, but Citigroup dropped 4 per cent after hours as it was revealed that the bank required more capital following the stress tests.Wells Fargo said it planned to increase its January declared dividend an additional 10 cents to 22 cents. Shares of the bank, which gained 5.7 per cent during the trading day, were up 0.5 per cent after hours.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7 per cent to 13,180.40, its highest point since December 2007.The blue-chip heavy index was led by earthmover Caterpillar, which rose 4 per cent at $113.30. The construction equipment provider has climbed more than 25 per cent since the new year. Miner Freeport-McMoRan was up 2.2 per cent to $39.09. Dow Chemical and DuPont each added about 3 per cent to $34.60 and $52.68.The Nasdaq Composite Index also broke into unfamiliar territory and closed above the 3,000 point threshold for the first time since December 2000. The Nasdaq was up 1.9 per cent to 3,039.88.The most heavily weighted stock on the index, Apple, continued to guide the Nasdaq’s rise, once again hitting an all-time high. The maker of the popular iPad and iPhone products added 2.9 per cent to $568.10.The announcement by JPMorgan added to other positive market indicators that came throughout the day on Tuesday. Retail data released in the morning showed sales rose to their highest in five months.Economists, however, sought to temper the significance of the retail report.Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, warned: “After a weak December, retail sales picked up considerably in January and February …However, retail sales data, like many other time series, seem to have received a boost from much better than normal weather in many areas of the country combined with overly generous seasonal adjustment factors, which is a very potent combination.”Later in the day, the Federal Open Market Committee said it would leave interest rates unchanged.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained 2.3 per cent to 428.20. Gains were led by chip makers including Micron Technology, which increased 5.1 per cent to $8.49. Advanced Micro Devices climbed 3.5 per cent to $7.76.CME, the US’s largest futures exchange, edged up 1 per cent to $272.99 after Monday’s news that its chief executive, Craig Donohue, is to step down at the end of the year. The exchange has struggled to restore confidence in its markets since the collapse of MF Global. Despite gains in recent months, shares are still trading down more than 8.5 per cent in the past year.Brad Hintz, analyst at Bernstein, said: “At the current stock price we believe CME shares offer exceptional value for a firm that can generate high single to low-double-digit growth rates long term, has stable pretax margins exceeding 60 per cent, boasts a defensible business model and has a number of real options related to mandated over-the-counter clearing.”Cyclical material stocks, such as US Steel, which was up 7.3 per cent to $28.31, also made strong gains.Retailing group Urban Outfitters was among the day’s worst performers, down 5.3 per cent to $27.95. The company reported a 48 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profits after it was forced to offer heavy markdowns to clear year-end inventories.Brian Tunick, retail analyst at JPMorgan, said: “Going forward, we continue to believe that with inventory under control and new management focused on improving product offerings, Urban Outfitters represents an attractive opportunity. We maintain a “buy” rating as we believe that the Street will remain excited over the potential improvements brought about by the “reassembled band”, setting up impressive [2012 fiscal year] opportunities.”Shares in China’s largest online video provider, Youku, fell 1.5 per cent to $31.40 after it climbed over 27 per cent on Monday as announced plans to merge with smaller rival Tudou.

On Tuesday, the benchmark index had suffered its worst day in nearly three months but had recouped all its losses and was up 0.3 per cent for the week.“We had seen a little weakness in the surveys leading up to Friday’s report and there was a bit of growing concern that we would miss the consensus number. But it came in line with expectations and the story continues to be that the economy is improving,” said Brad Sorensen, director of market research at Charles Schwab.“We are starting to see a bit of a move away from the risk on, risk off mentality that dominated last year. We still have a way to go, but the starting signs are there,” he added.Homebuilders were among the best performers, with Lennar leading the pack, adding another 3.1 per cent to its gains for the week to close at $25.45. The company was up 12.2 per cent since Monday’s open. Close behind were DR Horton, up 6.3 per cent to $15.47, and PulteGroup, up 3.7 per cent to $9.02. The homebuilders added 11.4 per cent and 8.2 per cent respectively on the week.Financials were slightly positive for the week after reports that there would be a payout for holders of credit default swaps. Markets were settled by late Thursday’s announcement that at least 85 per cent of Greek bondholders had agreed to participate in the €206bn debt exchange. JPMorgan gained 1.8 per cent to $41.03 and Citigroup rose 1.8 per cent to $34.20 on the week.The oil and gas explorer Anadarko Petroleum gained 2 per cent to $85.25 on Friday as the Texas company said it had resolved a tax dispute with an Algerian producer. That could net Anadarko up to $4.4bn over the next few years, according to a report.Overall, the benchmark US index has climbed 9.2 per cent in the year to date. US equities have now doubled from lows sustained this time three years ago, according to Tobias Levkovich, an equity strategist at Citigroup.“Panicked investors feared the onset of a new economic depression at the time, and it did not materialise. Nonetheless, the memory of that experience still has a post-traumatic-like impact on investor psyche that may take years to heal fully, as the S&P 500 had plunged almost 52 per cent in the two years leading up to that March 9 [2009] price point,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 12,922.02, down 0.2 per cent for the week. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales, climbed 0.5 per cent to $60.04 on the blue-chip heavy index on Friday.Cyclical material stocks were among the worst hit this week as fears of a slowdown in China were stoked by the country’s adjustment of its target growth rate on Monday.Aluminium maker Alcoa dropped more than 4.5 per cent for the week to finish at $9.81. Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan fell over 9.6 per cent dropping to $38.78. US Steel Corp rallied 3.6 per cent on Friday to $26.85, but was still down 2.6 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite index got within 10 points of hitting 3,000 – a threshold it crossed during trading last week for the first time since the dotcom boom 11 years ago. The tech heavy index ended the week up 0.6 per cent to 2,988.64.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, maker of the Keurig single-cup coffee system, tumbled 15.7 per cent to $52.59 on Friday after Starbucks announced plans to introduce a rival product, Verismo, late on Thursday. Shares in Starbucks gained 2.9 per cent to $51.84 on the day.“We would use any overreaction to the obvious move by Starbucks to enter automated espresso as a buying opportunity in [Green Mountain] during a period when [the company] just enjoyed incredible momentum during the holiday selling season,” said Scott Van Winkle, retail analyst at Canaccord, who reiterated the firm’s “buy” rating on Green Mountain shares.Shares in Apple climbed 0.6 per cent to $545.17, up just 0.1 per cent on the week. The consumer technology company unveiled the latest iterations of its products on Wednesday, including a third generation of its popular iPad tablet.Groupon, the e-coupon company, gained 0.5 per cent to $17.06 but was off 10.2 per cent for the week. Renren, the Chinese social networking site, rose 0.9 per cent to $5.40 on Friday after it said it had swung to a profit in its fourth quarter.First Solar, the renewable energy company, rose 5.1 per cent to $27.49 on Friday, but lost 8.4 per cent for the week. At one point, the company touched its lowest level in six years as pressure on the solar industry is driven by Chinese competition and decreased levels of government subsidies.

US Steel Corp shed 4.7 per cent to $26.21.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,363.44 as analysts sought to temper pessimism.“This should not have been a surprise for the markets [and] the full report released last night showed [the Chinese] are offering further measures to stimulate their economy,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.Stocks had fallen during the morning session on tepid US economic data, as a gauge of factory orders fell for the January period, but recovered slightly in afternoon trading.“This is a continuation of the market needing strong data from the US to show the economy is self-sustaining,” Ms Krosby said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,962.81, as blue-chip material stocks were also hit by China’s growth warning. Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer, lost 3.6 per cent to $9.87; earthmover Caterpillar shed 2.1 per cent to $110.09; and Dupont fell 1.1 per cent to $50.89.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 2,950.48, slipping further from the psychologically important 3,000 benchmark, which it breached intraday for the first time in 11 years last week.Apple shares opened higher, to within $2 of its record high of $548.21 set last week. But the iPad-maker declined 2.2 per cent to $533.16.First Solar was the biggest loser on the S&P, dropping 6.5 per cent to $28.08. The world’s largest maker of thin-film solar panels continued to reel from its disappointing fourth-quarter results released last week, while reports suggested natural gas producers are as likely to benefit from clean energy subsidies as renewable energy companies.WPX Energy climbed 2.8 per cent to $18.33, as analysts speculated that the natural gas producer could be subject to a takeover bid, after its shares sold off, as natural gas prices fell last year.Big bank stocks dropped as attempts continued to secure participation in the planned private sector exchange of Greek debtBank of America was down 2 per cent to $7.97, Morgan Stanley was off 3.1 per cent to $18.48, Citigroup fell 1.2 per cent to $33.68 and Goldman Sachs was off 1.1 per cent to $119.95.AIG gained 2 per cent to $30.39 on news that it would sell $6bn worth of shares in AIA Group. The insurer, which was bailed out by the US government during the financial crisis, said it expects to use the funds to pay down debt it owes to the US Treasury.Fertiliser manufacturer CF Industries fell 5.5 per cent to $177.98 as Citigroup analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on the stock, arguing that the company’s comprehensive natural gas price hedging strategy, reduces the potential for the company to benefit from low prices for the commodity this year .“While hedging adds visibility to CF’s margins, it may have left some profit potential on the table with [year to date] average [natural gas] prices near $2.60,” PJ Juvekar told Citigroup clients.Advanced Micro Devices lost 5.2 per cent to $7.07 as the semiconductor manufacturer said it would pay at least $150m to break an exclusivity agreement with one of its clients.Micron Technology also fell 5.2 per cent to $8.20 as the Philadelphia index of 30 semiconductor stocks fell 2.6 per cent.Micron, which manufactures dynamic random access memory for computers, had rallied strongly last week after a Japanese rival filed for bankruptcy, raising hopes of consolidation in the sector.Zynga shares fell 4.9 per cent to $13.97, after Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan removed his “buy” recommendation on the stock, after it briefly topped his $15 target last week.“We believe Zynga shares are fairly valued and could be range-bound in the near-term until we see greater clarity around the strength of newer games and their ability to increase both users and payers,” said Mr Anmuth.Groupon, the e-coupon company, dropped 5.6 per cent to $18.13.MetroPCS shares slumped 5.7 per cent to $9.96 as Sanford Bernstein analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on shares in the wireless network.“[The company’s] long term prospects are more pedestrian,” Craig Moffett told clients in a note. “Competition is greater in their core markets than it once was – due partially to the shifts down-market from Sprint and T-Mobile.”Polypore International, the plastics manufacturer of a key lithium battery component for the Chevrolet Volt, dropped 9.7 per cent to $35.91 after reports late Friday said Chevrolet would temporarily suspend production of the electric vehicle.Computer Science Corp rose 2 per cent to $31.93, as the company signed a letter of intent with the UK’s National Health Service, as it attempts to rescue a lucrative contract."
135;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-02-08T15:04:29Z;DRC: Land of wasted opportunity slips further;Katrina Manson looks at the reasons miners queue up to do business in a difficult country;"No matter how low the Democratic Republic of Congo’s reputation for corruption, contract expropriation and inefficiency sinks, mining companies keep on coming.Its southern Katanga province is not only the political powerhouse of the vast jungled country, but home to critical reserves of copper and cobalt.So important is the $2bn investment from Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold of the US into the world’s largest cobalt producer at its Tenke Fungurume mine, for example, that Congo makes it on to a US list of top 20 sites to protect from terrorist attack.Yet the country has all the hallmarks of an ill-governed, corrupt state: despite vast mineral wealth, it has slipped to the rank of the world’s least developed country and is falling in the World Bank’s “doing business” indicators.“The whole place is one big scam and everybody’s being paid off,” one investor told the FT last year.Years of conflict and graft have limited any chance the mining sector might have to drive growth in a country whose 70m population is among the world’s poorest. Gecamines, the former state mining company is about $2bn in the red, equivalent to the amount of mining investment expected to come into Katanga.Yet mining is really all the country has to rely on, comprising up to 80 per cent of export earnings and 12 per cent of gross domestic product in an economy that Matata Ponyo, the finance minister, says is set to grow at 6 per cent this year, down from 7 per cent in 2011.The World Bank says that, were Congo to steward its “superb mineral resource” better, it could bring in revenues equivalent to about 20 per cent of GDP by 2014. Copper and cobalt production could rise to $4.4bn by 2020, from $1.3bn in 2009 and provide $1.2bn in revenues in 2020, up from a measly $177m in 2009.Congo sits, after all, on the world’s largest reserve of cobalt, with 5m tonnes, and provides half the world’s cobalt every year. It is also the second biggest copper-rich region, with 70m tonnes in reserves.“Even if the copper price goes down there is no danger for us,” says Moise Katumbi, governor of Katanga, citing its high average grades of copper, at about 3 per cent, easily outstripping Chile’s 1 per cent. “That’s why people are investing. There is more appetite than we were thinking.”Mr Katumbi is keen to avoid a repeat of the 2008 commodity crash, which saw thousands lose their jobs and mines close almost overnight after copper prices plunged from $9,000 a tonne to $2,500. Export earnings fell by more than $3bn in a single year.Prices have since recovered, and Mr Katumbi says investors are further buoyed now that the uncertain and sometimes violent election period is over. Disputed results late last year and heavy-handed state security saw rival candidates each proclaim themselves head of state, while dozens were shot dead.The re-election of Joseph Kabila as president assures many investors of continued stability. Some told the FT they were relieved they would not have to spend time bribing a new regime with which they were not familiar. Others hope claims of a rigged election will ensure Mr Kabila is aware he has less legitimacy than before and takes a more cautious line.Price recovery and a long-term view about large reserves has seen China and South Korea strike multibillion-dollar deals of late, in agreements that offer infrastructure in return for minerals, although the projects are slow to get going. India is pursuing a similar strategy.Glencore, the commodities trading company, is among the groups that have invested directly in mines. South African money is coming in alongside dozens of smaller scale miners – buying and processing operations run by Lebanese, Indian and Chinese concerns.Many that have already established themselves and are keen to increase production are also behind target, however. Freeport, the largest investor and copper producer in the country, which has paid $516m in taxes since 2006 and has 6,700 workers, says that it will invest $850m in a two-year expansion of its operation this year.The company is expecting to produce 195,000 tonnes of copper by 2013, up from 127,400 last year and still expects volumes to “expand significantly over time”.Yet, like many set on expansion, regulatory headaches and a dearth of energy have meant long delays. The company was among those snagged by the mining review intended to reassure the World Bank and others, but which instead targeted companies that failed to get on with the more weighty part of the political elite.The most obvious victim of the painfully protracted review of 61 companies, which cancelled 16 contracts, put Freeport on hold, and talked of “renegotiating” the rest via a variety of payments, was First Quantum of Canada.Once it had fallen foul of the political establishment, there was no holding back. First Quantum lost its contested Kolwezi tailings concession in a contract expropriation that sold the licence on to London-listed ENRC via Dan Gertler. Then it lost two more mines, including the biggest copper mine in the county, Frontier.Analysts say that the $1.25bn settlement that First Quantum elicited for the mines serves everyone up a “win-win” deal, but they rather forget the effect on the country. Five thousand jobs were lost, production put on hold at a time when prices were high and a national reputation further buried in the dust, raising political risk premiums.“It [the $1.25bn settlement] does serve as a lesson; it should be harder to do these deals that are so obvious and blatant,” says Eric Joyce, a UK MP who is head of the Parliamentary Great Lakes of Africa Group. “There is strong concern about the kind of people you do business with when something is so obviously corrupt.”He released documents on the eve of presidential elections that suggest Mr Kabila’s government has deliberately undersold state mining assets, many in Katanga, to anonymous offshore shell companies, losing the country more than $5.5bn.Contract wrangles persist, over China Minmetals Resources’ recent acquisition of Anvil Mining, for example, and even ENRC has yet to determine its right to mine. Two other of its former First Quantum properties – Frontier and Lonshi – belong to a Hong Kong-registered company whose owners and ultimate beneficiaries have not been declared.“We are pretty confident that this relationship [with Congo] will have no problems in the future,” says Felix Vulis, ENRC chief executive. Mr Katumbi, a millionaire businessman himself, insists Katanga faces no downside risk. “People just have to be patient; if Congo were corrupt, we wouldn’t have gone to the arbitration court,” he says.This article is subject to a correction and has been amended."
136;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-02-07T18:53:17Z;Glencore and Xstrata deal could reshape industry;;From the shovel to the shelf.The vertically integrated business that Glencore and Xstrata are pushing forward with their $90bn merger, combining a commodities trader with a miner under the same roof, aims to capture each and every dollar along the supply chain.“That is where the opportunity comes,” says Mick Davis, chief executive of the miner. His new deputy, Glencore’s chief Ivan Glasenberg, agrees.Half joking, half serious, Mr Davis describes the vertical integration as a sum in which “one plus one means eleven”.Yet, few other mining executives believe that the vertically integrated business is the model to follow. And the history of mining offers little support: over the past two decades many of the large mining companies have shed their trading divisions.In fact, Glencore and Xstrata aim to succeed where many others have failed.“This is rather unique,” says Philippe Chalmin, a professor at Université Paris-Dauphin and author of the classic Traders and Merchants: Panorama of International Commodity Trading. “We have never seen the integration of a commodities trading house and a miner at this scale,” he adds.Traditional miners, including until now Xstrata, focus on exploration and production. A few also have processing businesses, including Freeport-McMoRan and Alcoa, transforming the ore into refined metals. Beyond – the logistics and trading businesses – is the area of the traders. Until now, none has successfully merged both sides.If Glencore and Xstrata are successful with their combination, the vertically integrated model could reshape the face of the mining industry, forcing rival companies such as BHP Billiton, Vale of Brazil, Rio Tinto and Anglo American to adopt it, either organically or by buying an established metals trader, such as Noble Group of Hong Kong or privately owned Trafigura or Gerald Metals.However, rivals are sceptical and insist they are in no rush to follow the duo’s lead.“I do not see us following the integrated model,” says a senior executive from one of the world’s top five miners, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to antagonise his rivals.The vertically integrated model faces a particularly important hurdle: the profitability of trading is generally small compared with the overall earnings from mining commodities such as thermal coal and copper, whose price is near a record high. Thus, even the best traders would struggle to move the needle of the company’s bottom line. If so, a rival miner may ask, “why bother?”Yet, some are already experimenting with their own trading arms. Peabody Energy, the US-listed company that is one of the world’s largest thermal coal miners, has built over the past decade an in-house trading arm that now accounts for roughly 10 per cent of its operating income. “It has been a very successful contribution,” says Vic Svec, senior vice-president at Peabody.But if the vertically integrated model fails – as rivals and history strongly suggest – it could unravel the biggest merger in the history of the mining sector.The dream of vertical integration has been long present in the mining industry, nonetheless. At the start of the last century, the Japanese industrial and financial business conglomerates, or zaibatsu, tried it, with mixed success. Metallgesellschaft and British Metal Corp, two leading metal trading houses, also had a foot in both trading and mining. But their size was minor compared with Glencore and Xstrata.Years later, others tried to build an in-house trading arm, including French aluminium producer Pechiney in the 1970s, whose famous Pechiney World Trade became briefly one the world’s leading traders in non-ferrous metals.Even London-listed Anglo American experimented with trading, even if tangentially. Minerals and Resources Corporation, known as Minorco, a holding company controlled by Anglo, held for a few years a 14 per cent stake in Philipps Brothers, the dominant commodities trader for much of the 1950s and 1970s.All of those companies ended shutting their trading arms because the business was not profitable enough – and, in many cases, failed to fit with the overall mining strategy.Mr Davis believes that the historical examples are not relevant for two reasons.First, he points out that Pechiney and the other companies that tried to build in-house trading arms failed not because the vertically integrated model was intrinsically wrong, but because of the difficulty of assembling a strong trading business.“It is bloody difficult to build up [a trading arm] from scratch,” he says. “The way that people think about remuneration rewards in mining makes it almost impossible to get the smartest people” for a miner-cum-trading house, Mr Davis adds.Second, he says that while miners have failed, other natural resources groups – oil companies – have made vertical integration their dominant business model.The world’s largest oil companies are integrated businesses with activities in the so-called upstream sector, involving exploration and oil production, with a downstream side involved in refining and marketing. Some of the world’s largest supermajors, including Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Total, have built strong in-house trading arms that ship millions of barrels a day across continents.In fact, some industry executives believe that one of the most famous mergers in the history of the oil industry could be the most relevant parallel to the Xstrata and Glencore combination: the merger in February 1907 of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company, with its oilfields in what today is known as Indonesia, and the “Shell” Transport and Trading Company, with its oil tankers’ business.Yet, that was more than a century ago, when the natural resources industry was in its infancy. Glencore and Xstrata want to do the same in a mature sector, which has already witnessed numerous business models. The task is extraordinary.Additional reporting by Jack Farchy in London
137;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-02-07T17:57:12Z;Tie-up to boost capability for mining deals;;"The ink is barely dry on Glencore and Xstrata’s $90bn agreement and executives and industry observers are already contemplating the behemoth’s next deal and how other miners might respond to their new rival.A bigger balance sheet offers Mick Davis, who will become chief executive of Glencore Xstrata International, scope to indulge his flair for dealmaking, confident that – as with Xstrata’s $19bn takeover of Falconbridge in 2007 – he can find value through mergers and acquisitions.“A merged Xstrata-Glencore makes most of the global mining industry potential targets,” says Christopher LaFemina, analyst at Jefferies. “There is a perception among the major mining companies that being bigger and more diversified should lead to a higher equity valuation. A bigger company with a higher valuation has more firepower to buy larger targets.”Xstrata’s cash generation and lower debt levels combined with Glencore’s liquidity following its $10bn float will help fund Xstrata’s capital expenditure, set to peak at $10.7bn this year, as well as deals, suggests rating agency Moody’s.“Opportunities come; we would look at everything,” says Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore’s chief executive.Mr Davis said: “We as a company have a greater financial flexibility and capacity to actually go after those transactions that otherwise we might think are beyond our reach.”First, however, the two have to integrate their operations and win over shareholders to the benefits of combining Xstrata’s mines with Glencore’s trading nous.“I don’t think the merged company, if the merger happens, will do anything major until 2013 as they will have a lot of market education and re-rating work to do,” says one investor who knows both companies.However, privately, industry experts expect that Mr Davis, alongside his new deputy, is already mulling a list of possible targets.At the top, they said, is surely Anglo American, the South African company founded by Sir Ernest Oppenheimer that once ranked as the largest global miner.“There is an element of empire building here,” notes one analyst. For Mr Davis and Mr Glasenberg, taking over the most blue-blooded of South Africa’s mining houses would be their pièce de résistance, he adds.In 2009, Mr Davis tried, and failed, to get Anglo to the negotiating table, emphasising the potential synergies available.Some of Anglo’s businesses, such as platinum, may fit uneasily with the new group’s model of funnelling Xstrata’s tradable commodities through Glencore’s marketing machine in pursuit of higher margins. Indeed, the company may shed Xstrata’s 24.6 per cent stake in platinum producer Lonmin, analysts are speculating, the subject of another takeover attempt in 2008.In contrast, Mr Glasenberg has made no secret of his interest in iron ore, a commodity that he has said fits “right into our sphere of trading”.The enlarged group could beef up its agriculture division, perhaps buying Gavilon, the commodity merchant put up for sale by its Wall Street backers. It could even ape BHP Billiton by branching out into oil and gas.Combining Mr Davis’s willingness to tackle higher-cost assets with Mr Glasenberg’s comfort with geopolitical hotspots opens up numerous options, say industry observersGlencore and Xstrata together would be able to absorb more risk, says its new management team, increasing Glencore’s operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example.Buying Toronto-based First Quantum would bulk up the company’s presence in Central African copper, while Kazakh-miner ENRC would increase exposure in the region and in ferroalloys.Other mining majors might balk at Freeport-McMoRan’s labour difficulties at its key Grasberg asset in Indonesia or its exposure to the DRC. But for Glencore-Xstrata, Freeport – long for sale at the right price – is also seen as a target, say people familiar with the company.For other miners, sheer corporate heft is increasingly seen as crucial in managing capital-intensive projects in far-flung parts of the globe, argue some. Mid-sized companies and those largely dependent on one commodity may have to reconsider their position.But the short-term response, faced with their new rival-cum-predator, is likely to be more prosaic.“The first step is not that there is a wave of deals but that companies begin to restructure their portfolios and work on their operations,” says Jeff Largey, analyst at Macquarie. “One of the best defences against a takeover is to improve performance and lift your own share price.”Additional reporting by Anousha Sakoui and Javier Blas"
138;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-02-02T19:42:17Z;Glencore and Xstrata close to $88bn deal;;Glencore and Xstrata have launched merger talks to create a $88bn commodities trading and mining giant with the financial muscle to sweep up some of its biggest rivals.The all-share merger, which could be formally announced as soon as Tuesday, would turn the natural resources industry worldwide on its head by combining the world’s largest trading house with one of the biggest mining groups.The merger plan – codenamed “Everest” in a nod to a joint Himalayan expedition by the two companies’ chairmen a few years ago – marks the culmination of five years of attempts to combine the two companies by Ivan Glasenberg, the South African billionaire who runs Glencore.The deal comes less than a year after the trading house floated its shares, raising $10bn and turning its top executives into billionaires overnight.The merger would shake up the mining sector in a similar fashion to the multibillion-dollar combination of BHP and Billiton in 2001 that triggered a decade of consolidation in the industry. The combined company would rank as the world’s fourth largest mining group by market capitalisation, behind BHP Billiton, Vale of Brazil and Rio Tinto. “This is the deal the whole market has been waiting for,” said Christopher LaFemina, mining analyst at investment bank Jefferies.Industry observers said the merger would in the medium term give “Glenxstrata” the financial firepower to bid for rivals, such as Anglo American and ENRC, or oil and agriculture groups.“The deal would give both companies the fire power to go big,” said a person familiar with the merger discussions. “The companies would be able to do any deal they want,” the person added.In order to overcome resistance from Xstrata, Mr Glasenberg is prepared to accept the role of deputy chief executive of the combined entity, with Mick Davis, his counterpart at Xstrata, becoming the new chief executive, people familiar with that talks said.Both men have reputations as uncompromising executives who have gone from being school friends in South Africa to formidable business rivals.Mr Glasenberg, 55, and Mr Davis, 52, have yet to agree on a new chairman, although Xstrata’s Sir John Bond is in the lead. Both companies plan to merge their boards and Xstrata could end up with the lion’s share of the senior management roles.Mr Davis would reap millions in shares in the newly merged venture from long-term incentive plans for 2010 and 2011. The value of the award will depend on the share price, but at Thursday’s price for Xstrata shares would be worth about £5m.The stock market welcomed the deal with both companies’ share prices rising strongly on Thursday. Xstrata climbed 9.9 per cent, while Glencore rose 6.9 per cent. But the “merger of equals”, as both companies described it, would face resistance from some shareholders at Xstrata, who believe Glencore, which already owns a 34 per cent stake in the miner, should pay a premium for control.How the Glencore and Xstrata merger stacks up, updated as the deal progressesThe trading house could offer a “small” premium to secure the deal, according to people familiar with the conversations. Over the last six months, Xstrata’s shares have traded on average at a level of 2.44 times those of Glencore. That implies that if the trading house were to offer a near-10 per cent premium to that average, Xstrata’s shareholders could receive 2.7 Glencore shares for each share they hold. At Thursday’s close, the share ratio was at a level of 2.66 times.Mr Glasenberg told the Financial Times last year ahead of the IPO that combining the two companies made strategic sense. “We believe there is good value in the two companies being together,” he said at the time.“Why has that not happened? It is a value debate. Xstrata …seems more comfortable for Glencore to go public and get a market price before they may or may not enter into discussions,” he added.Mr Glasenberg argued that having the flow of Xstrata’s commodities production within Glencore’s trading operations was “advantageous” to both companies. “There are a lot of benefits and synergies to put the two companies together,” he said.Xstrata is being advised by JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Nomura. Morgan Stanley and Citigroup are advising Glencore.

139;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-02-02T18:22:46Z;Potential mining tie-up to attract scrutiny;Some regulators view Glencore and Xstrata as a single entity;The enormous influence that a potential Glencore-Xstrata combination would exert on global commodities markets is set to attract antitrust scrutiny worldwide, according to lawyers, rival executives and bankers.Glencore already owns a 34 per cent stake in Xstrata and some regulators, including the European Commission, therefore consider both companies as a single entity when reviewing competition in commodities markets.Yet, insiders agree that even Brussels would take a further look at the combined company. Although the review could delay the completion of the merger, insiders do not expect that competition issues would be an obstacle to the deal.“I expect that everyone would review the deal,” said a personal familiar with the situation. “But the EU already considers Glencore and Xstrata as a single entity and others are unlikely to impose onerous measures.”The weight of the combined group in commodity markets is likely to stretch beyond the size of its output. Glencore already trades large volumes of commodities over and above its own production, so the group will have control over a large swath of some markets.And while Glencore is already involved in the marketing of much of Xstrata’s output under long-term agreements, the merger would give it greater control over the flow of commodities, analysts said, potentially allowing it to extract higher margins from its trading business.“Although Glencore has some form of marketing rights over the majority of Xstrata production, a combination would provide greater control, market share and arbitrage opportunities, especially in coal, zinc and copper,” said analysts at Credit Suisse.The combined entity would dominate the global markets for thermal coal, zinc, lead and ferrochrome. With Xstrata already the market leader and Glencore the largest trader, the merged company would control about 30 per cent of the internationally traded thermal coal market, according to FT calculations based on company data.It would also control almost 25 per cent of the global market in zinc, used by the steel industry, and 10-15 per cent of the markets for ferrochrome, essential for making stainless steel, copper and lead.With one of the strongest growth pipelines in the industry, it could also become the world’s largest copper producer within a few years, analysts said, overtaking Freeport-McMoRan of the US and Chile’s state-owned Codelco. The combined group’s copper production is set to grow 50 per cent by 2015, according to Credit Suisse estimates, as Xstrata’s Las Bambas project in Peru and Glencore’s investments in central Africa come to fruition.Regulatory and antitrust concerns derailed BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto’s attempt to combine their iron ore operations in Australia and also played a role in scuppering BHP Billiton’s hostile takeover attempt for PotashCorp.Marc Waha, competition partner at Norton Rose in Hong Kong, said: “I would think that any transaction will attract close scrutiny in customer countries – EU, China, US, Japan, Korea – and in supplier countries – Canada, Australia, Brazil – alike, and that parties will face a protracted process.”With a market value of $88bn based on Thursday’s closing share prices, the combined group would be catapulted into the mining big league, just ahead of China’s Shenhua Energy, currently the fourth-largest listed mining company, but still some way behind BHP Billiton, Vale of Brazil and Rio Tinto.Its 2011 profits would amount to $7.5bn according to Credit Suisse estimates, compared to consensus estimates of $20bn for BHP Billiton, $15.5bn for Rio Tinto and $6bn for Anglo American.Assuming no redundancies after the merger, the group would employ 127,000 globally. One challenge of the deal is likely to be the integration of Xstrata’s mining engineers and geologists with Glencore’s light-footed commodity traders.But Jeff Largey, mining analyst at Macquarie, said the risk of a culture clash was overblown. “These are two companies that already have a working relationship,” he said.Additional reporting by Ben McLannahan in Tokyo

Juniper Networks advanced 6.1 per cent $23.88, while Cisco Systems was one of the best performers in the Dow Jones index, putting on 1.3 per cent to $19.79 ahead of results.Semiconductor manufacturer NetApp was up 8.3 per cent to $37.51 on reports it could be a subject of takeover bids.Cloud business software developer Salesforce.com rallied 6.3 per cent to $114.51 as Canaccord Genuity analysts said the company’s recent weakness on new billings, could prove temporary, “and not necessarily indicative of [the] firm’s outlook”.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.7 per cent to 2,788.33, but Google, the second most heavily weighted stock in the index, plunged 10 per cent to $581.35 in after-hours trading, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations by a large margin.The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced just 0.4 per cent to 12,623.98. The S&P 500 finished 0.5 per cent higher at 1,314.50, a gain of 4.5 per cent for the year.The benchmark index is set for its best January since 1997, but analysts warned a disappointing start to the earnings season could weigh on the index. Of the 59 S&P 500 companies that had reported by Thursday afternoon, only 49 per cent had beat expectations, the lowest level in 10 years, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.“Investors are now faced with losing the catalyst that strong earnings growth typically provides during reporting season,” said Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.Bank stocks continued to rally, as Morgan Stanley and Bank of America beat analyst expectations with fourth-quarter results, but materials, the other star sector of this year’s rally, sold off as profit fell at copper miner Freeport-McMoRan and Newmont Mining lowered its 2012 copper production forecast.BofA eked out a fourth-quarter profit on strong loan growth, although a lossmaking quarter for its investment banking unit weighed on performance, continuing the trend set by JPMorgan and Citigroup.Morgan Stanley declared a loss, but one that was much smaller than expected by analysts, as the investment bank bucked the trend to report an increase in trading revenue.BofA closed up 2.4 per cent to $6.96, after breaching $7 for the first time since the end of October in the morning session. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.4 per cent to $18.28. Other big bank stocks also rallied, except for Wells Fargo, which slipped 0.3 per cent to $30.15.Regional bank Huntington Bancshares fell 4 per cent to $5.79 as its average return on assets fell slightly despite a surge in lending, as the low interest rate environment appeared to take a toll.Freeport-McMoRan opened 2.5 per cent lower, before paring losses to end the day off just 0.2 per cent to $44.37. Fourth-quarter profit of $640m was less than half the figure for the same period in 2010. But many analysts had predicted worse results, after labour disputes hit production at its Indonesian mines in the fourth quarter. Newmont Mining fell 1.2 per cent to $59.60, after raising its forecast for gold output, but lowering guidance on copper extraction.Gas-focused energy exploration and production companies continued their torrid 2012, after natural gas futures, which have been plummeting for some time, hit a decade low.Cabot Oil & Gas fell 6.5 per cent to $63.09 and Range Resources fell 4.1 per cent to $54.06. Cabot is now off almost 17 per cent year to date.Ebay climbed 3.9 per cent to $31.51, as the company beat fourth-quarter estimates, thanks mainly to heavy usage of its PayPal electronic payments site. But some analysts focused on the less than stellar performance at Ebay’s core internet auction website business.“We continue to question the sustainability of the recent mid-teens core general merchandise volume growth rates heading to 2012,” said Brian Nowak at Nomura.Car parts manufacturer Johnson Controls slumped 8.4 per cent to $32.60 for the worst performance in the S&P 500 as the company lowered full-year earnings guidance, citing weakness in demand from Europe.But the aircraft part supplier Rockwell Collins climbed 5.5 per cent to $59.96 after the company said it was doubling production of parts for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner this quarter.First Solar slumped 10 per cent to $38.70, on reports the German government will cut subsidies for solar energy.

141;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2012-01-19T18:27:48Z;Higher copper prices lift Freeport profits;;Freeport McMoRan, the world’s biggest publicly traded copper miner by turnover, raised its profits in 2011 despite a paralysing three-month strike that halted output at its largest mine.US-based Freeport lost production of 235m pounds of copper and 275,000 ounces of gold last year because of a violent strike at Grasberg, a remote Indonesian mine that is crucial to global supply. Attacks on Grasberg’s pipelines and employees exacerbated the effects of the strike, which ended in December when the company agreed to higher pay and more worker benefits.The disruptions drove a decline in annual copper production from 3.9bn pounds in 2010 to 3.7bn pounds last year. The impact on the group total was mitigated by stable or higher production at Freeport’s North and South American mines.Higher average copper prices edged pre-tax profits higher from $8.5bn last year to $8.8bn. Freeport’s profits exceeded the record levels it attained last year, when it declared a special dividend to clear excess cash from its books. Freeport remains in a net cash position.The company’s performance continued to track a copper price that remains buoyant despite a marked softening in the fourth quarter of last year.The company sold copper at an average price of $3.86 per pound compared with $3.59 last year. Production costs rose from 79 cents to $1.01 per pound, as multinational miners such as Freeport struggle to contain rising costs of labour, raw materials, and power.The strike hit Freeport’s gold production, which fell from 1.9m ounces to 1.4m ounces.Richard Adkerson, chief executive of the Phoenix-based miner, said the company was “taking steps to restore full operations” at Grasberg, where a force majeure declaration remains in place.The company guided the market to expect roughly flat copper production this year, with expected sales of 3.8bn pounds, and lower gold production, with expected sales of 1.2m ounces.Tenke Fungurume, Freeport’s mine in the politically unstable Democratic Republic of Congo, continued to expand production last year and remained the largest mine in that country.Revenues were $20.1bn compared to $19bn, while earnings per share rose from $4.57 to $4.78 per share.Freeport shares were flat at $44.50 in afternoon trading in New York.
142;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Freeport strikes deal over Papua mine pay;Dispute crippled production at miner’s Indonesian operations;A deal has been reached between thousands of striking workers and managers at Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, ending a three-month labour dispute that has crippled production at the miner’s Indonesian operations.Losses have run as high as $18m per day for the US company, which operates one of the world’s largest gold and copper mines in the remote eastern highlands of Papua, since roughly 8,000 workers began industrial action on September 15. The shortage of supply has also lifted international copper prices.Production was shut down completely in October due to sabotage of facilities and escalating violence. Police shot and killed two workers during a rowdy protest and unidentified assailants killed three miners on Freeport’s sprawling Grasberg complex.A trade union official said on Wednesday they had agreed to a 37 per cent pay increase over two years, with an initial 24 per cent rise on January 1 with the remainder coming a year later.Freeport said it was “pleased to have reached mutually acceptable terms with its union workers” and that they would start reporting to their positions in the coming days. It is still repairing fuel lines damaged during the strike.“Shipments of concentrate are expected to be limited until full operations are restored, which is expected by early 2012,” it added.The deal ends the lengthiest and possibly the most costly strike in Indonesian history.Freeport’s Indonesian operations are 90.6 per cent owned by US parent company Freeport-McMoRan, based in Arizona, with the remainder in the hands of the Indonesian government. Freeport is also Indonesia’s largest taxpayer, contributing $1.9bn in 2010 and more than $19bn over the past decade.Grasberg produced 625,000 tones of copper last year, or about 3 per cent of global supplies. It is also one of the world’s top gold mines.The strike has reduced production to just five per cent of normal capacity, leading to a fall in group profit and higher copper prices on international markets.Papua is Indonesia’s easternmost and least developed province. Despite vast natural resources, its people remain poor and they suffer systematic abuses at the hands of Indonesian security forces, rights groups say.Freeport has long been the source of conflict. The situation is further complicated by Indonesia’s only remaining separatist movement. Low-level fighting between poorly armed rebels and government forces claims a few lives each year. A majority of Papuans, who have different ethnic and religious roots to their political leaders in Jakarta, want independence.
143;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-12-14T09:25:55Z;Copper projects at risk as Peru leaders get tough;Community unrest is becoming the biggest threat to mining ventures;When Ollanta Humala won Peru’s presidential elections in June, the mining industry took fright.Six months later, the leftwing president, who rode to power on a promise of a windfall tax on the sector, has surprised even the most optimistic industry observers.Confronted with growing unrest over Minas Conga, a $4.8bn project that would be the country’s largest ever single investment, Mr Humala might have been expected to take the side of the protesters, his natural supporter base.Instead he has come down on the side of Newmont and Buenaventura, the miners, and is taking no prisoners. Ten days ago he declared a state of emergency, and over the weekend he replaced half of his cabinet, including the prime minister, apparently because of the failure of the negotiating process.Despite the remarkably business-friendly attitude demonstrated by this response, the escalation of the dispute over Conga should worry investors in Peru’s mining sector.The ramifications are potentially huge: Peru is the target of large investments by many big international miners, including Xstrata, BHP Billiton and Anglo American, and is set to be the source of a large part of the supply growth for key commodities in the next five years – most strikingly copper, for which it could contribute a third of new supply.Mr Humala’s actions over the past fortnight demonstrate that he is becoming more confrontational.As well as imposing a state of emergency, he has appointed Oscar Valdes, a retired army lieutenant-colonel, as his new prime minister, suggesting a hardline approach to the protesters.If the new approach aggravates rather than resolves social unrest, those mining projects that are delicately poised on the cusp of development could suffer.Indeed, there is overwhelming consensus among mining executives in Peru that community unrest is the most severe threat to mining investment in the country. Unlike neighbouring Chile, where many mines are in the desert, Peru’s mineral-rich mountains are also home to countless farming communities, which compete with the mining industry for resources – primarily water.Should the unrest at Conga spread to the rest of the state of Cajamarca, as much as $9.6bn of mining investment will be under threat, according to César Pérez-Novoa of Celfin Capital, including Rio Tinto’s La Granja project and Anglo’s Michiquillay deposit.Already this year, Southern Copper’s Tia Maria project and Bear Creek’s Santa Ana project have been scuttled by protests while Anglo American said recently in September that it would “pause” development at Quellaveco, one of its main copper projects, due to a dispute with the local communities.While higher taxes can be anticipated and budgeted for, local protests cannot. The greater the level of confrontation between government, miners and local communities, the harder it is for the industry to plan for future investments in the country.Indeed, Pedro Fuenzalida of LarrainVial, a leading South American brokerage, has pushed back his expectations for all Peruvian mining projects that are not yet under construction.In a worst-case scenario, that could affect such mega-projects as Xstrata’s flagship Las Bambas mine, Chinalco’s Toromocho, and the expansions of Cerro Verde and Antamina, two large copper mines owned by consortiums of miners including BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Freeport-McMoRan.Between them, the projects mentioned above are slated to bring about 1.5m tonnes of annual copper production on to the market in the next five years – more than the total current output of Peru, the second-largest copper producer in the world.The risks of Mr Humala’s hardball approach are clear.
144;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-12-13T08:55:15Z;Freeport Indonesia ends labour dispute;;"A labour dispute in Indonesia that has brought production at one of the world’s largest copper and gold mines to a standstill and cost the company hundreds of millions in losses may well be over.US mining giant Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold has reached a deal with trade unions to return 8,000 striking workers to work after a three-month stoppage, Reuters reported on Tuesday.A deal would be a huge relief to Freeport, which has been losing about $18m a day in missed income since it shut down operations in October after several miners were shot dead by unidentified assailants. The strike, fuelled by discontent over working conditions and lower pay than miners at other Freeport sites, has been marred by violence, with police opening fire at a rowdy workers’ protest, killing two.Reuters cited sources who said that the union accepted an offer of a 40 per cent pay rise over two years to bring to a close the longest industrial action in Indonesia’s history. Freeport declined to comment.Workers went on strike on September 15, demanding a massive pay increase of around 400 per cent, which Freeport dismissed as excessive. During weeks of tense negotiations, the demand came down from an initial $200 per hour to around $7.50. The current minimum wage is $1.50.A resolution could also impact international copper prices, which have been supported during recent global market turmoil by supply constraints at Freeport.Freeport’s Grasberg mine in the restive Papuan highlands, is the single largest source of tax income for the Indonesian government, paying more than $2bn last year. The site, located in one of the most impoverished and underdeveloped regions of Indonesia, is 90 per cent-owned by Freeport, with the state holding the remaining share.A resolution of the labour dispute would enable Freeport to resume production, but its troubles in Indonesia are far from over. It will now have to enter negotiations with the government, which is seeking a higher share of profits from 51 major oil, gas and mining companies.Related reading:

145;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-11-21T18:12:18Z;Gold drops amid rise in risk aversion;;Continuing Eurozone worries and US budget talks weighed on commodity prices with gold falling below the $1,700 level for the first time since the start of November.The rise in risk aversion spread to the yellow metal, which had been fluctuating in a band of $1,700 and $1,800 band for most of the month, having lost some its haven appeal of late.Bullion retreated along with other commodities to $1,682.80 a troy ounce in midday trading in New York, down 2.5 per cent from its last price on Friday.“The market is very volatile at the moment,” said Anne-Laure Tremblay, analyst at BNP Paribas.She noted that the Vix index – which measures volatility in US equities and is often dubbed Wall Street’s “fear gauge” – was up 8.8 per cent on Monday.Rising volatility in stock markets was crossing over to commodities, affecting sentiment among gold investors. Other commodities shrugged off tight demand and supply fundamentals, losing ground on macroeconomic worries.In the crude oil markets, ICE January Brent fell $1.14 a barrel to $106.40 and Nymex January West Texas Intermediary declined $1.90 a barrel to $96.77.Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange lost 3.4 per cent to $7,296.25 a tonne, in spite of news of a strong outlook for Chinese demand.Morgan Stanley said Chile’s Codelco was looking to settle 2012 copper premiums – the price paid over the LME price – with Chinese consumers at $110 a tonne.The level is a 4 per cent fall from 2011 but higher than the $90 a tonne premium settled in October with European buyers.As the world’s largest copper producer, Codelco’s price agreements are regarded in the industry as a benchmark.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the outcome demonstrated tight market conditions and lack of supply growth in 2012 as well as suggesting that the producers and consumers of the metal had a more positive view on fundamentals than the market prices implied.Also on the supply side, the strike at Freeport McMoran’s Grasberg mine in Indonesia, now in its third month, is expected to last until mid-December.Aluminium fell 2.7 per cent to $2,072.50 a tonne and nickel declined 0.4 per cent to $17,675 a tonne. Tin for three-month delivery on the LME declined 3.7 per cent to $20,700 a tonne.
146;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-11-09T15:57:08Z;Striking Freeport workers reject 35% pay rise;;Workers at Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc’s Grasberg mine in Indonesia will extend industrial action for a third month after rejecting a 35 per cent pay rise – prolonging one of the most serious labour disputes in the emerging democracy’s recent history.About 8,000 workers at Grasberg, which holds the world’s largest recoverable reserves of copper, have been on strike since September 15, demanding higher wages and better working conditions. Freeport is also dealing with continued wage problems at its Cerro Verde mine in Peru.The decision to prolong the Indonesian strike, announced by union leaders on Wednesday, adds pressure on Freeport as it is also being pushed by Indonesian authorities to renegotiate its contract and pay the government more revenue.Freeport is in the deepest crisis since it began operating in the remote Papuan highlands of eastern Indonesia in 1991. The strike has been accompanied by sabotage of its production facilities, a blockade of supply routes and the fatal shooting in October of three miners by unidentified assailants.Last month, following the shootings, Freeport shut down production of gold, copper and silver, prompting it to declare force majeure on millions of dollars worth of ore shipments, costing Freeport an estimated $18m per day.Juli Parorrongan, union spokesman, said on Wednesday the latest round of discussions broke down over a demand by workers for the minimum wage to be increased from $1 per to $4 per hour. They had initially sought $7.50. Freeport has offered up to $1.35 per hour and says its offer is more than fair by Indonesian standards.“This is our final number. It won’t be lowered. If the company agrees to pay, then we will stop our strike today,” Mr Parorrongan said.Freeport’s Indonesian operations are 90.6 per cent owned by US parent company Freeport-McMoRan, based in Arizona, with the remainder in the hands of the Indonesian government. Freeport is also Indonesia’s largest taxpayer, contributing $1,9bn in 2010 and more than $19bn over the past decade.Grasberg produced 625,000 tones of copper last year, or about 3 per cent of global supplies. It is also one of the world’s top gold mines. The strike has reduced production to just five per cent of normal capacity, leading to a fall in group profit and higher copper prices on international markets.Additional reporting by Taufan Hidayat.
147;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-10-27T19:48:51Z;Copper climbs back above $8,000 mark;Miners and industrial metals boosted by return of risk appetite;Industrial metals and mining stocks were boosted by the return of risk appetite following the eurozone agreement, and copper rose above the $8,000 level for the first time in five weeks.The first steps by European leaders to try and resolve the sovereign debt crisis cleared some of the macro economic worries which had been keeping investors away from commodities markets. Copper for three month delivery was up 5.3 per cent in midday trading in New York, at $8,150.25 a tonne, while zinc rallied 4 per cent to $1,943 a tonne and aluminium 1.8 per cent to $2,258 a tonne.“On the one hand it appears the macro backdrop is likely to become less hostile for commodities, and on the other, for copper, you’ve got some very tight underlying fundamentals,” said Nicholas Snowdon, base metals analyst at Barclays Capital in New York.The copper price, which has risen 14 per cent from the start of the week, has been supported by news flow pointing to returning demand from the Chinese, the largest consumers of the red metal, and falling supplies.Investors were cheered by Chinese import data of refined copper in September which rose to a 16 month high, while copper prices were supported by Freeport McMoran announcing force majeure for Indonesia’s Grasberg mine as well as continued labour problems at the US copper miner’s Cerro Verde mine in Peru. Together both mines account for about 5 per cent of global output and prospects of falling production pushed the price of copper higher.Mining shares jumped, with BHP Billiton up 7.1 per cent to £20.82, Xstrata up 10.8 per cent at £10.59, while Glencore, the trading house, rallied 10 per cent to 427.72p.However, iron ore prices continued their recent collapse, dropping a further 6 per cent on Thursday to $120 a tonne for benchmark 62 per cent iron content material, taking the fall since the start of the month to 30 per cent.Teck, the Canadian miner that is the world’s second-largest producer of coking coal, a key steelmaking ingredient, revised down its expected coal sales for the year on the back of weakness in global steel markets. “Concerns about a global economic downturn could further lower demand for imported steelmaking coal and reduce our fourth quarter sales volume,” the miner warned.Nonetheless, some analysts argue that prices have fallen beyond the level justified by fundamentals. Ric Deverell, head of commodities research at Credit Suisse, said: “If macro sentiment can be stabilised, the fall in the iron ore price will prove to have been overdone, with a significant rebound likely over coming months.”
148;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-10-26T12:33:20Z;Grasberg force majeure declaration lifts copper;;Copper prices jumped more than 3 per cent on Wednesday after Freeport-McMoRan, the US miner, declared “force majeure” on some shipments from the world’s second-largest copper mine.The declaration, which allows the Arizona-based company to walk away from contracted deliveries, comes after a month of an increasingly acrimonious strike at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia.Grasberg, which is 90.6 per cent owned by Freeport, produced 625,000 tonnes of copper last year, or about 3 per cent of global supplies. It is also one of the world’s top gold mines.Freeport said that lower production had “impacted our ability to fully perform our sales commitments”, confirming that it had declared force majeure on “affected” sales agreements for copper concentrates, the raw material used to make the refined metal.“The strike action at PT Freeport Indonesia has impacted production and concentrate shipments,” the company said. “Throughout the period, we have worked cooperatively with our customers on the revised concentrate production and shipping schedule.”News of the force majeure declaration at Grasberg spurred a rally of more than 3 per cent in copper prices on the London Metal Exchange on Wednesday morning, helping to erase some of recent months’ punishing falls. The benchmark contract for delivery in three months rallied to a peak of $7,785 a tonne, up 15 per cent from last week’s lows.Companies that had been due to receive shipments from the Indonesian mine would now have to seek supplies elsewhere and potentially drive prices up, traders said.Freeport said in its quarterly results last week that it had lost 32,000 tonnes of production due to strikes at Grasberg in the second quarter, and estimated that over the full year the strikes would cut production by about 45,000 tonnes.Nicholas Snowdon, base metals analyst at Barclays Capital, said the declaration of force majeure “would appear to indicate that the company are anticipating a prolonged period of disruption at the facility”. He added that the strike was “already contributing to a period of clear tightening in the concentrate market”.Grasberg, set in the remote highlands of Papua, has been the source of communal tension and deadly rivalry between Indonesian security forces competing for protection contracts and lucrative illegal gold-tailings rackets, relating to leftover ground ore. Gun attacks killed several Freeport employees last year when buses transporting miners were targeted by unidentified assailants.The situation is further complicated by a low-level insurgency seeking independence from Jakarta, which some analysts believe is gaining strength due to local opposition to Freeport’s presence and a vast wealth divide. Papua is one of the most impoverished and least developed regions in Indonesia, with average income far below the national average.As many as 12,000 Freeport workers taking part in the strike are demanding an increase of their $1.50 hourly wage and employment terms, which their union claims are the worst of all Freeport’s operations.“We are committed to being fair and generous to our workforce, and we are hopeful we can reach a resolution soon,” Richard Adkerson, Freeport’s chief executive, said last week.

Taleo Corporation, which sells human resources software to businesses, was up 7.9 per cent to $31.61. SuccessFactors, which markets business education courses, rose 9.3 per cent to $26.24.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.4 per cent to 2,699.44 at the close.The S&P 500 advanced 1.3 per cent to 1,254.20, its highest close since the start of August, and decisively above the 1,220 to 1,230 range where two previous rallies stalled in recent months.The Vix index of implied volatility in the S&P 500 closed below 30 for only the second time since early August. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” had been above 30 for most of August and September.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent to 11,900.03.“EU debt negotiations didn’t go off the rails over the weekend, and it appears that some progress may have even been made toward an agreement,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.The rally was broadly cyclical with material and industrial stocks in the S&P 500 up 2.3 and 1.7 per cent respectively. Both sectors were helped by a better than expected “flash” purchasing managers’ index survey in China.Alpha Natural Resources, which supplies China with metallurgical coal for use in the manufacture of steel, was up 9.5 per cent to $23.79. Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan was 8 per cent higher at $23.79.The defensive utility, telecom and consumer staples sectors were the only S&P 500 components to fall.Caterpillar surged 5 per cent to $91.77, after the company reported record revenues and delivered earnings per share of $1.71, a full 15 cents higher than the average analyst expectation in a Bloomberg poll.The company raised its 2012 earnings outlook by a fifth, and said global economic uncertainty had not fed through to demand for its earthmoving equipment.Shares in health insurer HealthSpring surged 33.7 per cent to $53.71, after rival insurer Cigna announced it would purchase the company for $3.8bn.The deal values HealthSpring at $55 a share, and would give Cigna access to HealthSpring’s customer base. HealthSpring sells premium insurance to customers eligible for Medicaid, the federal health insurance programme for retirees. Cigna shares were down 0.6 per cent to $45.34.The deal helped Humana, another health insurer focused on Medicare-eligible clients, gain 4.8 per cent to $79.93.In the property sector, Citigroup analyst Josh Levin released a note arguing that “the structural excess supply of homes is exhausting itself.“The inventory of existing homes for sale [3.48m in September] has been declining on a year on year basis for the past eight months and now stands at a multiyear low,” Mr Levin told clients.Although he warned the “shadow inventory” of homes in foreclosure could yet add to the housing stock, homebuilder shares continued their strong October rally.The SPDR Homebuilders exchange traded fund, which tracks the return on homebuilders listed in the S&P 500 was up 2.9 per cent to $16.49. The ETF has risen 30 per cent in three weeks, after hitting a low of $12.30 at the start of October.Lennar Corp, considered one of the healthiest of US homebuilders because of its low debt levels, was up 1.7 per cent to $17.02, a gain of 33.6 per cent since October 4. PulteGroup, a more volatile stock carrying high debt, was up 6.3 per cent to $5.21, a gain of 47.2 per cent since October 4.Commercial property service provider CB Richard Ellis Group surged 9.5 per cent to $16.74.Lorillard, the maker of Newport cigarettes, fell 0.6 per cent to $114.97 after earnings per share of $1.94 came in below average analyst expectations. Gross profit of $563m was $3m lower than the same quarter last year, as higher costs offset increased sales of cigarettes and higher pack pricing.Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of Kleenex and other household brands, fell 4.6 per cent to $69.65. Earnings per share of $1.26 were in line with expectations, but net income fell to $432 million compared with $469 million in the same quarter last year.Sprint Nextel was down 2.9 per cent to $2.69, as a judge weighed whether to dismiss the third-largest US mobile network’s opposition to the takeover of T Mobile by its AT&T.

Trading was upbeat but twitchy ahead of the European summit this weekend to discuss a support plan for the region.Better than expected US economic data of late and a generally well-received US earnings season is encouraging bullish strategies, with the brave also prepared to bet on a positive outcome when details of any Euro-package are mooted to be unveiled on Wednesday.The FTSE All-World equity index was up 2.2 per cent in a market that has been adding “risk on” positions as the session progresses.The euro rallied strongly after an early dip and was up 0.8 per cent to $1.3894, while the dollar index, which traditionally displays an inverse correlation to risk appetite, was down 1 per cent. Indeed, the buck at one point hit a record low versus the yen of Y75.78, according to Reuters.Commodities were firmer, with Brent crude adding 0.2 per cent to $109.95, while perceived havens, such as US Treasuries and German Bunds, saw sellers, nudging yields higher by several basis points. Gold was up 1.2 per cent to $1,640 an ounce.Wall Street’s S&P 500 rose 1.9 per cent to 1,238, its highest close since August, and above resistance at 1,230. Extra impetus came from well-received earning reports from General Electric, Honeywell and McDonald’s.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 advanced 2.5 per cent, with the banking sub-index leading the charge on a gain of 3.8 per cent, as investors reckon a support mechanism to stave off Eurozone sovereign debt contagion will be delivered within the next several days.Despite the broadly bullish mood, investors will be aware that any negative news, chatter or speculation over the progress being made by the eurozone to contain the region’s sovereign debt crisis could see sentiment turn on a dime.This has been a stark feature of recent sessions, with assets vacillating in response to reports that point to progress or disagreement.That said, it was noticeable that Wall Street on Thursday appeared able to escape the clutches of eurozone angst and carve out a gain based primarily on reduced fears that the US economy could face a double-dip recession.A surprise expansion in the mid-Atlantic region’s factory activity – it’s strongest performance in six months – bolstered investor stoicism, and it looks like that has been carried over into Friday’s session.Still, traders remain nervous. The S&P 500 may be at the top of its 2½ -month, 120 point range, but the Vix index, a measure of expected market volatility that is considered a good gauge of investor anxiety, remains elevated at 32.Earlier in the session, Asian markets posted modest gains as banks and technology shares were lifted by cautious optimism for a comprehensive rescue package for the eurozone in coming days.The FTSE Asia Pacific index is up 0.2 per cent. South Korean construction firms rallied as the death of Libyan dictator Muammer Gaddafi boosted hopes for the resumption of stalled construction projects in Libya, pushing the Kospi index up 1.8 per centTechnology shares in Tokyo and Seoul were initially supported by Microsoft reporting a modest profit gain and after SanDisk beat Wall Street estimates. The Nikkei 225 closed barely changed, however, typifying dealers’ reluctance to take big punts in case weekend Eurozone events scupper strategies.Gains in the region were limited by declines in resources stocks after Thursday’s sharp fall in copper prices, and this left Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index with a loss of 0.1 per cent.…..Trading Post.To maintain financial health one should always listen to the doctor: Dr Copper, that is.The red metal is so named because it is considered most erudite in its forecasting of global economic activity.

151;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-10-21T16:44:26Z;Three shot dead near Freeport’s Indonesia mine;;Unidentified gunmen killed three people near the Grasberg mine in Indonesia’s restive Papua province on Friday morning, raising the number of fatalities during a month-long workers’ strike to seven.The sprawling Grasberg mine contains the world’s largest recoverable copper reserves and largest single gold reserve. It is run by PT Freeport Indonesia, an arm of Arizona-based Freeport-McMoRan.The deteriorating security situation at Grasberg, where thousands of striking workers have blockaded supply routes and sabotaged mining installations, forced Freeport to halt production earlier this week.Antara, the state news agency, identified one of the victims in Friday’s shooting as Aloysius Margana, who has worked for Freeport on a contract basis for 20 years. He was an uncle of a prominent Indonesian legislator, Roy Suryo.Two of the victims were still unidentified. Indonesian police did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Two others were shot dead last week near the same site.Since July 2009, 11 people have been shot dead and 41 wounded at Grasberg. The mine has been plagued by communal violence, with accusations that rival security forces are competing for protection rackets and also control of nearby run-off streams that can carry gold “tailings”.Earlier this month, police shot and killed two mine workers while trying to control a rowdy protest by thousands of striking Freeport miners, who are demanding higher wages and better working conditions.Papua, on the western half of the island New Guinea, is a militarised and underdeveloped mountainous province that is off-limits to foreign journalists and activists. It was annexed by Indonesia in 1969, following a vote widely considered to have been rigged by the Indonesian military.Indonesia is enjoying its longest period of political and economic stability in recent history. But Papua remains a highly sensitive issue for the government of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the retired general-turned-president. A low-level insurgency has been waged for decades in the impoverished region, which is seeking independence from Jakarta. Dozens of political prisoners remain in jail for ties to the largely peaceful independence movement.Elsewhere in the province on Wednesday, Indonesian troops opened fire on thousands of ethnic Papuans demanding greater social rights, killing up to five.The incident occurred after about 2,200 police and army troops surrounded as many as 4,000 Papuan protesters. A declaration on self-determination was read out and a banned flag was raised, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.“Following this declaration the security forces opened fire, allegedly as warning shots only,” the commission said in a statement. “Tear gas was used and security personnel from the army and police started dispersing the crowd and beating up numerous participants.”Hundreds of protesters were detained and at least 100 remained in custody, the commission added. Five were charged with treason and face possible life imprisonment.The commission said it feared for the safety of those in custody and called for an investigation into the killings.Indonesia security forces in Papua systematically torture and abuse prisoners , the UN has said.

But analysts said they expected the Hitachi acquisition to be approved by the end of the year.“The hard drive market is mature and PC sales growth is under pressure, so consolidation makes sense,” said Jason Nyoland, a technology analyst at Robert W Baird.Western Digital fell 9.3 per cent to $24.44 and is down almost 14 per cent for the week after saying on Monday it had closed manufacturing facilities in Thailand due to flooding.Seagate shares were off 0.4 per cent to $12.05.The S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,209.88 as Apple fell 5.6 per cent to $398.62.The group missed earnings and revenue targets for the first time in several years on Tuesday evening. Despite Wednesday’s losses, Apple remains one of the few S&P 500 stocks to have made gains since the sell-off began in July.The S&P 500’s retreat marked the third time this summer a rally has peaked narrowly above the 1,220 mark.In a sign of profit-taking on Tuesday, investors pulled $3.26bn out of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF after the index had hit a 75-day intraday peak of 1,233.1.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.6 per cent to 11,504.62 and Apple weighed on the Nasdaq Composite, which was down 2 per cent to 2,604.04.Morgan Stanley, the second-largest US investment bank by market capitalisation, returned to profit, posting $2.2bn in earnings for the quarter ended September.A “debt valuation adjustment” – an accounting measure used by many US banks this quarter to bolster the value of their debt – accounted for $1.12 of the $1.15 in earnings per share.But many analysts had been expecting an underlying loss.Morgan Stanley surged as much as 6 per cent in the first minutes of the session, trading above $17.50, a value not seen since August. But the stock was only up fractionally to $16.64 at the close.Regional bank stocks had mixed performance on quarterly results.PNC, up 0.2 per cent to $51.33 and US Bancorp, down 1.4 per cent to $24.13, took advantage of the big banks’ retreat from consumer lending to expand high margin loan books.But Dallas-based Comerica fell 10.5 per cent to $23.13, as its net interest margin shrunk to 318 basis points, much lower than the bank had forecast, as the Fed’s Operation Twist drove down the yield of its mortgage-backed securities.Intel rose 3.6 per cent to $24.24 after posting record quarterly revenue and earnings per share of 65 cents, despite a 32 per cent decline in sales of its low-power Atom microprocessors, as Apple’s iPad reduced the market for netbooks.Freeport-McMoRan, the miner, reported net income of $1.05bn despite a shortfall in output due to strikes at an Indonesia mine.Earnings per share of $1.10 were 14 cents lower than the same period last year but beat analyst expectations.

The college said it had improved retention.Defence group United Technologies Corporation was off 1.2 per cent to $73.26, though it reported an 11 per cent rise in profits compared with the same quarter last year and raised full-year earnings guidance.Bank of New York Mellon was off 1.2 per cent to $19.54 after it reported a 4.7 per cent rise in profit to $651m.Analysts were cheered that trust assets had risen 6 per cent from the same period last year to $25,900bn, suggesting the largest US trust bank is managing to attract customers despite facing a federal lawsuit for regularly overcharging for foreign exchange transactions.
154;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-10-19T18:23:46Z;Mine strikes cause fall in Freeport’s profit;;"Strikes at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia cost Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest listed copper miner, production equivalent to about 7 per cent of its copper sales and 25 per cent of its gold sales in the third quarter, the company said on Wednesday as it reported an 11 per cent drop in post-tax profit.Grasberg has the largest recoverable reserves of copper and the largest single gold reserve in the world. An eight-day strike in July and a second dispute that started in mid-September have cut copper production by 70m pounds and gold production by 100,00 ounces, Freeport said. At its average selling prices for the quarter, that production would have been worth about $420m.The Indonesian unit is operating with only about 60 per cent of its workforce as a result of the strike by union members, who are demanding an increase in their $1.50 hourly wage and improvements in their employment terms, which their union claims are the worst of all of Freeport’s operations.Set in the remote highlands of Papua, Grasberg has been the source of communal tension and deadly rivalry between Indonesian security forces competing for protection contracts and lucrative illegal gold tailings rackets.Richard Adkerson, Freeport’s chief executive, said in a call with analysts on Wednesday that the open-pit mine was now running at about two-thirds of normal capacity, and the underground operations about 80 per cent.However, Freeport has been reconfiguring its work on the site to focus on production from the higher-grade areas, and it expects to limit the lost output to just 30m lbs of copper in the final quarter of 2011, even if the strike continues to the end of the year.“We are committed to being fair and generous to our workforce, and we are hopeful we can reach a resolution soon,” Mr Adkerson said.Freeport, which began open pit mining of gold, copper and silver in the remote mountains of eastern Indonesia in 1990, now hopes to expand its deep-pit operations there, opening up new reserves.Mr Adkerson said: “Our resource available to us at Grasberg is going to be there; it’s a question of when we are going to be able to mine it.”The lost production caused by the strike contributed to a 14 per cent drop in copper sales– to 947m lbs – and an 18 per cent decline in gold sales – to 409,000 oz – compared with the third quarter of 2010.For the fourth quarter, Freeport expects sales to drop further, to 915m lbs of copper and 305,000 oz of gold.Net income was $1.1bn for the third quarter, down from $1.2bn in the equivalent period of 2010, and earnings per share fell from $1.24 to $1.10.The figures were above the consensus of analysts’ forecasts, which had on average predicted earnings of $1.03 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.Stronger metals prices helped lift operating cash flows 38 per cent to $1.8bn for the third quarter. The average selling price of gold was up 34 per cent on the previous year, at $1,693 an ounce, while copper was up 3 per cent at $3.60 a pound.However, with metals prices now retreating again, Freeport expects a slowdown in operating cash flows to about $1.1bn in the final quarter of 2011."
155;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-10-18T19:44:55Z;Metals and miners lead declines;;Industrial metals and miners led the declines following news that China’s gross domestic product in the third quarter grew at its slowest pace in more than two years.China, which accounts for 40 per cent of global copper demand, saw its GDP for the three months to September grow 9.1 per cent year-on-year. The figure was down from the quarter before, slowing for three consecutive quarters.Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange fell 2.4 per cent in European late morning trading to $7,279 a tonne. The red metal failed to respond to reports that Freeport-McMoRan was weighing up the options over its Grasberg mine in Indonesia, including the possible mothballing of the copper mine.Zinc declined 1.8 per cent to $1,868 a tonne, while lead fell 1.1 per cent to $1,939 a tonne.China data hit mining shares. Rio Tinto, which had gained ground at the start of the week on news of the streamlining of its aluminium business, was among leading decliners, down 5 per cent to £31.37, while BHP Billiton fell 2.8 per cent to £18.57 and Xstrata lost 3.4 per cent to 917.1p.Concerns about French banks and the health of the European economy also weighed on commodity prices. Crude oil gained, with the December ICE Brent benchmark up 99 cents a barrel to $111.15, and the November Nymex West Texas Intermediate advanced $1.96 a barrel to $88.34.Gold, which failed to break above the $1,700 level on Monday, retreated along with other commodities. Bullion was trading down 0.7 per cent at $1,658 a troy ounce. Despite the morning weakness, Standard Bank noted a fall in speculative shorts, adding that “confidence in gold could grow over the coming weeks”.
156;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-10-17T21:25:33Z;Strike forces Freeport to halt operations at Grasberg mine;Death toll in Grasberg dispute reaches five;PT Freeport Indonesia, a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan, the largest listed copper producer, has been forced to shut down all operations at its Grasberg mining operation due to strike action, emphasising the risks of deteriorating labour relations in the mining industry.Concerns about a fall in production and supply at Grasberg in Indonesia, the world’s second-largest copper mine, underpinned the metal, with the price of copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange rising more than 1 per cent to $7,660 a tonne in early European trading.Although copper later fell 0.7 per cent to $7,506 a tonne on concerns about the global economy, it saw support at the $7,500 level.Freeport, based in Arizona in the US, had been operating at “minimum production” at Grasberg since 12,000 of 23,000 workers went on strike last month to demand higher pay.The group also faces problems in Peru, where its union has broken off talks about a contract during a strike at Cerro Verde mine, which supplies about 2 per cent of world output.Freeport shares closed down 4.5 per cent at $35.11 in New York trading.At Grasberg at least five people have died since the strike began, including two men who were shot by police trying to control a crowd.Freeport said it was compelled to halt activities due to the unrest. It gave no date for a resumption.“These production activities can only be carried out when it is safe for employees to work, facilities are protected from sabotage, and PT Freeport Indonesia communities are able to get necessary supplies,” it said.“Until these conditions are met and maintained, PTFI must stop production activities.”The group is expected to update investors about the impact when it reports its third-quarter results on Wednesday.Freeport said that during the past week at Grasberg “there have been numerous illegal activities and violent crimes committed”, including blockage by workers of truck convoys carrying essential supplies, threats and intimidation of employees, trespassing, and illegal use of company property.Grasberg has the largest recoverable reserves of copper and the largest single gold reserve.Freeport-McMoRan’s miners in Peru launched a hunger strike on Monday, Reuters reports. They seek to pressure the government to resolve a labor dispute 19 days into a walkout at the Cerro Verde copper mine.Workers at Cerro Verde , which produces 2 percent of the world’s copper, pulled out of negotiations on Friday and said the labor ministry must define a wage accord. The union demands an 11 percent raise.“We’ve exhausted all our options and only the regional government can solve this,” said union leader Leoncio Amudio.Amudio said 15 workers were participating in the hunger strike.
157;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Wall Street ends week with a spring in its step;;In a week where the S&P 500 moved into bear territory, breaking below the 1,100 barrier for the first time in a year, Wall Street closed Friday in surprisingly good cheer, buoyed by strong retail sales data and a better than expected employment report.The 23 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters posted a 5.1 per cent year-on-year increase in same-store sales for September, handily beating analyst expectations. The corresponding figure in September 2010, when the economy appeared to be in much ruder health, was only 2.7 per cent.Bellwether discount retailer Target posted a 5.3 per cent increase in sales and its shares rose 5.1 per cent for the week to $51.56.Limited Brands, which operates high-end chains including Victoria’s Secret, enjoyed double digit year-on-year sales growth. The stock rose 5 per cent for the week to $40.43.Bulk goods retailer Costco posted a 12 per cent rise in sales, although a decision to raise membership fees to offset higher commodity prices alarmed investors. Shares fell 3.8 per cent to $79.02, the second-worst performing stock in the S&P 500.The consumer discretionary index of the S&P 500 was up 4.1 per cent for the week. Since markets began to slide in late July, the sector has outperformed the broad S&P 500 by more than two percentage points.“We’ve had sixty days of bad economic news and falling markets, but consumers are still going out and buying stuff, and at a healthy clip too,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.But some retail analysts were worried resilient consumer spending may be debt-driven.“Taken as a point in time, September sales data do look very strong,” said David Strasser, hardline retail analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. “But we question whether that is sustainable, if consumption is outpacing wage growth.”At 4.7 per cent in July and 4.5 per cent in August, the personal savings rate – the fraction of US personal income that is not consumed – has fallen beneath 4.8 per cent for the first time since 2009.The broad S&P 500 was up 2.1 per cent for the week, as European politicians appeared to inch towards a co-ordinated recapitalisation of the continent’s banks. An FT report to that effect late on Tuesday had sent the S&P 500 up 4 per cent in forty minutes.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.7 per cent for the week to 11,103.12, and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.6 per cent to 2,479.35.But US banks ended a volatile week on a low note. Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were down 3.7 per cent Friday. A leak, late on Thursday, of a draft text of the Volcker rule, which would seek to stop proprietary trading by banks, caused alarm. By the week’s end, Tuesday’s euphoria at the prospect of European bank recapitalisations had also given way to worries about the speed of implementation.“As with everything in Europe it’s going to happen slower than the markets want,” said Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities.Bank of America was down 3.6 per cent for the week to $5.95, after a 6 per cent fall on Friday. Goldman Sachs fell 5.5 per cent Friday to end the week down 2 per cent at $94.56. But despite its own 6 per cent fall on Friday, Morgan Stanley ended the week up 5.4 per cent to $14.24.That represented a turnround for Morgan Stanley, which was hit early in the week by reports that some banks were cutting exposure to the firm, as the cost of buying insurance on its debt hit 30-month highs.On Friday Morgan Stanley received a vote of confidence from analysts at its rival Goldman Sachs. Goldman’s options team put out a note recommending clients buy calls and sell short-dated credit default swaps to profit from a rise in the Morgan Stanley share price.“We believe concerns regarding its European swap and loan exposures appear overdone,” Goldman’s equity research analysts wrote in the note.Apple shares were down 2 per cent for the week to $369.80, after a lukewarm reception for its latest iPhone model, and the death of founder and figurehead Steve Jobs.Sprint was by far the biggest faller in the S&P 500, losing 10 per cent of it market capitalisation on Friday afternoon, to close the week down 10.9 per cent at $2.71, after its chief executive said the mobile phone network may need to raise additional capital.Sprint also announced it will upgrade to a 4G network next year, which sent the share price of its current wireless network provider, Clearwire, tumbling 32.2 per cent to $1.39.Material stocks were the best performers in the S&P 500 on renewed hopes for global growth. Copper and gold miner Freeport-McMoRan was up 11.7 per cent to $34.01. Cliffs Natural Resources, which extracts iron ore and metallurgical coal, used in the manufacture of steel, was up 9.2 per cent to $55.87.Wynn Resorts, the casino chain, reversed two weeks of heavy losses to close the week up 12.1 per cent to $129.06. Nomura analysts came out in defence of the stock, which had been hit by fears of a decline in Chinese junket tourism to Macau.Shares in Yahoo jumped 17.5 per cent to $15.47 over the course of the week after reports suggested Microsoft was preparing a bid for the internet portal. Microsoft denied interest but Alibaba remained in the running, along with various private equity houses.AMR, the holding company of American Airlines, was down 15.5 per cent for the week to $2.50, on reports the company is considering bankruptcy.Seed company Monsanto was up 18.1 per cent to $51.56 after reporting strong quarterly sales.
158;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-10-06T18:25:22Z;Oil prices rally as risk appetite improves;;Commodities and crude oil prices rallied on the back of expectations of easier monetary conditions as the Bank of England announced further quantitative easing and following the European Central Bank’s announcement to boost liquidity.The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, which includes wheat, copper and oil, gained 0.8 per cent, as risk appetite returned. Crude oil prices, which had gained ground on a surprise fall in US inventory data on Wednesday, continued their ascent. November ICE Brent, which briefly slipped through the $100 support level earlier this week, rose 41 cents a barrel to $103.28, while November Nymex West Texas Intermediate rallied 84 cents a barrel to $80.54.Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas, said news of increased liquidity helped an oil market, which was already supported at lower levels by supply and demand fundamentals.Oil demand in emerging markets was holding firm, with little spill over effects from developments in the leading OECD countries, while non-OPEC supply growth, which had been expected to come on to the market in the third and fourth quarters of this year, had been pushed back, he said.Hopes that liquidity would help Europe avoid a recession boosted industrial metals. Copper, which is closely associated with industrial activity and economic growth, rose above the $7,000 support level.Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange, rallied 3.9 per cent to $7,187.75 a tonne, while other industrial metals were firmer with aluminium up 1.6 per cent to $2,225 a tonne, and tin adding 5.7 per cent to $22,100 a tonneAs London Metal Week draws to a close, the market saw news coming out of Indonesia, where Freeport McMoran, the largest listed copper producer, faced strikes at Grasberg, and Zambia, where the new government on Thursday lifted a suspension on metal export permits.The Zambian mines ministry ordered the suspension in a document sent to exporters on October 4, saying new guidelines were to be introduced to the sector. The decision followed concerns that copper exporters have not been paying their full duties to the state and it was seen as an attempt to improve transparency in the industry. Officials said the move was in line with a presidential directive that all exports be cleared through the central bank.Lifting the suspension, government officials said the new measures would come into effect when the Bank of Zambia was ready. Zambia’s copper production is expected to be around 730,000 tonnes this year and international companies including Glencore, First Quantum, Vedanta Resources and Vale have operations in the country.
159;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-10-06T10:10:56Z;Conclusions from LME Week;Demand, prices, M&A and the sale of the LME itself dominate;"The biggest annual gathering of the metals and mining industry, LME Week, is almost over. As we expected, the talk centred on demand and prices, the prospect for mergers and acquisitions in the sector, and the future of the London Metal Exchange itself.Demand: “It doesn’t feel like 2008.” How many times did we hear that? Everyone came to LME Week looking for signs that the global economy was heading back into a financial crisis and recession; but at least from the metals trading community, there was little evidence of that.In general copper demand appears to be holding up relatively well. Volumes at most companies are still up year on year – even in Europe. The current market is flat, rather than sharply lower as it was in 2008, with Germany still showing reasonable growth.In the US, demand growth has slowed. Freeport-McMoRan, for example, told us that the US copper rod market, of which they account for half, would register 3 per cent growth – down from 6 per cent last year, but still growth. There are pockets of weakness – for instance, the construction sector or the beverage can industry in North America – but there are also pockets of strength. Yet everyone is rightly concerned about the “external” factors. A senior trader said: “My metals market is holding well, so I do not understand why prices are falling.” He added: “But if Greece goes down, then I don’t know what happens”.China, as ever, is the focus of much disagreement. Some believe demand growth has slowed significantly – say, to 5 per cent – driven by tighter credit conditions and the slowdown in the rest of the world, which would curtail export growth. Gu Liangmin, head of the copper department at Minmetals, predicted that copper prices could fall below $6,000: “Real demand of copper in China is slowing, the import of copper is slowing, the export (typically from bonded warehouses to LME warehouses) is expanding fast. The import of copper (especially this year) is closely related with financing activity, not directly with real demand to a big extent.” Others think demand growth in copper is still running at 8 per cent and it is merely a question of time before the Chinese return to the market and restock heavily. Minmetals itself has provided some evidence of that with its C$1.3bn bid last week for Anvil, a copper miner.The physical markets are also providing evidence of tightness. Spot treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs) – a measure of the tightness of the market for copper raw materials – have dropped to the lowest in a year at about $35/3.5c. Annual contract TC/RCs are likely to be settled in the same range as last year’s $56/5.6, traders believe. Annual premiums for refined metal have dropped, but not drastically. Codelco is offering European customers $90, down from $98 last year. Negotiations with the Chinese haven’t begun yet, but traders are expecting premiums of $105-$110, down from $115 last year.So, what does the demand situation mean for prices?Diego Hernández, Codelco chief, gave us a prediction of $3-$4 a pound ($6,600-$8,800 a tonne) for copper prices in 2012. Another senior miner gave us a wider range, from $6,000 to about $8,800. There are probably about as many people who disagree with him on either side of the prediction. Many are expecting lows below $6,000 – such as Mr Gu of Minmetals – while plenty of others expect copper to retest record highs in excess of $10,000.One reason to be bullish – scrap. The so-called “urban mine” of recycled metal accounts for about one-third of global copper supplies. As prices have fallen, so scrap flows have slowed down dramatically, tightening the market even if demand is weaker than a few months ago. The scrap dealers we talked to said they were not going to release their commodity until prices recovered; they did the same in 2008-09, helping to push prices up.Reasons to be bearish – Greece. Yes, the country consumes almost no copper when compared to, let’s say, China. But a default could trigger a chain of events in Europe and beyond that could push the global economy into recession.M&A: With share prices down as much as 40 per cent year-to-date and valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings below the 5-year average, everyone is betting that corporate predators are about to strike.Bankers have spent the past four days pitching deals to clients. Yet executives and investors think that a round of M&A faces two main obstacles: first, few companies want to spend lots of money in an uncertain environment; second, sellers would be hesitant to transact at current prices, even if buyers offer hefty premiums.Nevertheless, there are signs that dealmaking is on its way. As the LME Week was entering its third day, New Hope Corp, the A$5bn Australian miner said it had received “numerous” takeover bids. Others are likely to follow. Bankers and executives speculate that ENRC, the London-listed Kazakh miner, and copper miners in central Africa, including Toronto-listed First Quantum, could be bid targets.Who would buy? Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg is on almost everyone’s mind. For sure, he appears to have the appetite to grow his company – and now has the money after the $10bn initial public offering earlier this year.The mining sector has seen deals worth $85.4bn this year, according to Mergermarket data, putting the industry on track to match the annual record of $114.4bn set in 2006. Mining has accounted for 5 per cent of global dealmaking by value this year, the highest share since at least 2005.As one executive put it, if you have the money – and most of us have the money, unlike in 2008-09 – and you remain bullish over the long-term, why would you wait to buy assets? One reason to wait, said another executive, is that if Greece goes down, the sector may need all the money it has to weather the recession.But the key word about M&A has been “bolt-on” rather than the “transformational” deals of 2007-08 – we saw an executive rushing away from a group of bankers trying to avoid another deal conversation. Those transactions, typically worth $20bn-$50bn, either failed or saddled companies with debt just before the commodities sector crashed.What they want is “opportunistic” deals in the $1bn-$10bn range that add some value but don’t reinvent the companies. Executives – and bankers – told us to expect the big names quietly snapping up smaller players. So the M&A round would generate few headlines, but probably end adding more value.A final point relating to M&A: when Glencore floated its shares earlier this year, its market capitalisation was about 12 per cent lower than that of Xstrata. Today it is about 15 per cent larger as the stock of the trading house outperforms the miner. Glencore, of course, owns 34 per cent of the London-listed miner. Almost everyone said a deal was inevitable.LME sale: Will the LME be sold? If our straw poll of shareholders is anything to go by, the answer is yes.Only one company of those we chatted to was dead-set against a sale, regardless of the price. Almost everyone else, it would seem, is prepared to take a look at what is on the table and consider whatever hefty windfall is on offer.It would be possible for the naysayers to block a bid, however, since a potential buyer needs support of 75 per cent of the shares. That means Goldman, Metdist and JPMorgan, the three top shareholders, could between them prevent a sale.We don’t think all three are opposed to a sale, but there are other conceivable permutations that could block it. For example, if you exclude Goldman and Metdist (assume, for the sake of argument, that they will be happy to sell and realise their big profit on the shareholding), exclude companies without a big metals futures trading business, and exclude the small, privately owned brokerages (on the assumption that it may be hard for them to refuse a big cash offer – though perhaps that is not universally true), we calculate that about 30 per cent of the shareholding of the LME is in the hands of large companies with a strong metals business, which could potentially want to block a sale."
160;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-10-04T20:56:46Z;Crude oil falls below $100 a barrel;;Crude oil tumbled to close below $100 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time since early 2011, pulled down by fears the global economy could be on the brink of another growth-sapping crisis.ICE November Brent crude, the global benchmark, dropped $1.92 to settle at $99.79 a barrel, the lowest close since February 7, before fighting stilled Libya’s oil wells. In New York, Nymex November West Texas Intermediate fell $1.94 to a one-year low of $75.67 a barrel.Analysts have been trimming estimates of oil consumption, as the economic outlook darkens and the European debt crisis intensifies. Oil partially recovered from steeper losses earlier Tuesday as Ben Bernanke, US Federal Reserve chairman, testified before Congress.Michael Wittner, US head of commodity research at Société Générale, said: “The bottom line is the oil markets are in the process of pricing in a weaker environment for economic growth and for oil demand growth.”Oil contributed to broad declines for commodities, with the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index falling as much as 1.4 per cent to the lowest reading since October 2010.Base metals softened just as LME Week, the largest gathering of the metals and mining sector, entered its second day in London. Copper for delivery in three months at the London Metal Exchange fell 0.1 per cent to $6,870 a tonne. Aluminium for delivery in three months dropped 0.5 per cent to $2,186 a tonne.Goldman Sachs, historically a commodities bull, reduced its Brent crude oil price outlook for 2012 from $130 to $120 a barrel and cut its copper forecast from $10,790 to $9,200 a tonne.“Barring a global financial crisis, we view the European turmoil as a headwind to global growth, which we expect will only take away some of the upside to commodity prices, not reverse it,” wrote Jeffrey Currie, Goldman’s head of commodities research.For some, Brent’s decline brought back memories of October 2008, when the benchmark collapsed from $100 to $65 a barrel at the height of the financial crisis.“The big question is: what phase of the cycle are we in now?” said Colin O’Shea, head of commodities at Hermes Fund Managers. “Currently it seems like this will be a modest slowdown. If that turns out to be reality, this should not be a repeat of 2008.”Gold was caught up in the negative sentiment, falling 3.2 per cent to $1,604.09 a troy ounce.The mining sector took another hit after Credit Suisse cut its target prices for leading companies a day after Morgan Stanley did the same. The natural resources sector is critical for London’s stock market, where it accounts for nearly a third of the blue-chip FTSE 100’s market capitalisation.Xstrata, the London-listed miner, suffered particularly, dropping 3.4 per cent. Rio Tinto fell 3.8 per cent, while BHP Billiton, the world’s largest miner by market capitalisation, declined 2.5 per cent. Anglo American slumped 3.4 per cent.
161;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-10-03T17:57:05Z;Miners set for increase in deals;;Mining executives are anticipating a pick-up in deal-making with the sharp 40 per cent drop in sector share prices over the last 10 months flushing out corporate predators.Sector executives and bankers see the share price falls, which have intensified over the last three weeks, as opportunity to buy up scarce natural resources near the bottom of the cycle.This has pushed valuation metrics, such as price-to-earnings multiples, below five-year averages, executives told the Financial Times at the annual LME Week, the largest meeting of the mining and metals sector.The comments came as it emerged Qatar Holding, an arm of the gulf state’s sovereign wealth fund, is planning to create a standalone investment vehicle to buy stakes in, or take over, gold companies. It intends to invest about $10bn in metals and mining companies, according to people familiar with the matter.“Everybody is looking, everybody is analysing potential opportunities. I think there will be transactions,” Richard Adkerson, chief executive of Freeport McMoRan, the world’s largest listed copper company, said in interview with the Financial Times.KGHM of Poland, one of the top-ten largest copper miners, also said the current drop in metals prices and mining stocks had created an opportunity for dealmaking as it presses ahead with plans to spend $3bn over the next two years buying smaller rivals.“This is a good time to buy projects,” Wojciech Kedzi, KGHM vice-president, said. “For M&A this is an opportunity to get some good projects cheaper,” he added.The mining sector has seen deals worth $85.4bn so far this year, according to Mergemarket data, putting the industry on track to match the annual record of $114.4bn set in 2006. Mining has accounted for five per cent of global dealmaking by value so far this year, the highest share since at least 2005.The mining industry is in far better financial shape that in 2008-09, when a series of acquisitions at the peak of the metals prices surge saddled some companies with large debts. Now miners are sitting on cash piles after 18 months of high prices, and all still believe the recent correction is merely a blip in the longer-term bull market for industrial metals.However, one big obstacle is that shareholders would be reluctant to sell on a falling market, unless buyers offer hefty premiums.Alex Williams, director at First Reserve, the private equity company which focuses on natural resources and is a top Glencore shareholder, said the price correction was a “buying opportunity for long term investors”, but added: “The question is, is anyone going to sell?”However, mining companies and trading houses from Rio Tinto to Glencore to Minmetals of China have launched recently takeovers in the $1.5bn to $5bn range. Bankers said more deals were likely in the short term in spite of anxiety about the outlook for the global economy and falling commodities prices.Executives and bankers said that copper, iron ore and coking coal were particular targets as companies bet that prices would remain strong. Potential targets include ENRC, the London-listed Kazakh miner, Australia’s New Hope Corporation, and copper miners in central Africa, including Toronto-listed First Quantum.Mining executives and bankers said companies are likely to be prudent, embarking on single-digit or low double-digit billion dollars acquisitions, mostly in cash, as they want to preserve a strong balance sheet amid worries that the global economic growth could slow further, in which it demand and prices for metals.Catherine Raw, natural resources portfolio manager at BlackRock, said M&A activity was likely to focus on buying smaller companies, paying in cash, rather than in the gigantic projects of the previous boom such the failed BHP Billiton’s attempt to merge with Rio Tinto or Xstrata’s unsuccessful takeover bid for Anglo American.“No one’s is going to go out and blow their brains out because, in a market where getting finance is harder than it has been, you need a strong balance sheet,” she said.
162;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-09-29T21:13:49Z;Relief rally lifts copper and industrial metals;;Copper and other industrial metals – which have been weaker for more than two weeks amid concerns about a Europe-led recession – staged a relief rally after Germany ratified greater powers to back the eurozone’s rescue fund.Commodities prices, which are closely linked to economic growth, have been hit hard by concerns that the eurozone debt crisis could push the continent into recession, dragging other developed countries with it. Copper, the most vulnerable in a downturn, suffered a heavy sell-off.Compared to industrial metals prices, which staged a recovery on Thursday – with copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange up 2 per cent at $7,210 a tonne and aluminium rallying 2 per cent at $2,245 – resource stocks failed to rebound.BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest mining company by market capitalisation, fell 1.9 per cent to £17.89, Xstrata declined 3.9 per cent to 856p and Glencore, the trading house, lost 3.3 per cent to 415p.Over the past few weeks, resource shares have been much more volatile than commodities prices, with equities leading the declines. Copper, for example, has fallen about 22 per cent since the start of September, but Antofagasta, the London-listed Chilean copper miner, has declined 29 per cent while Freeport-McMoRan, the US based mining group, has declined more than 33 per cent.Iron ore has only fallen 5.9 per cent since the start of the month but Rio Tinto, the mining group which sees about 70 per cent of earnings from the bulk commodity, has dropped over 22 per cent.“The equity market is very nervous about the global economic outlook,” said Grant Sporre, analyst at Deutsche Bank. “There has been a lurch down in mining equities, followed by the commodity complex – with the exception of iron ore – followed by another lurch down in mining equities.”The pattern of share price declines in resource stocks followed by commodities prices is similar to that of the market turmoil in 2008. However, analysts point to differences, such as the strong balance sheets of the large raw material groups.“The equities are pricing in too aggressive a fall in commodities,” said Ash Lazenby, analyst at Liberum. But with fears over the economy weighing on sentiment, “you will continue to get weakness until you get a real resolution in the eurozone,” he added.
163;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-09-22T21:16:24Z;Resources tumble on demand fear;;"Commodities and resources stocks have plunged to their lowest in a year after several miners warned that some customers were “unexpectedly” curtailing their orders.The comments, coupled with weaker activity in China and a warning by the US Federal Reserve that the risks of a slowdown were rising, spooked investors.The benchmark Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a basket of commodities including wheat, copper and oil, fell 4.4 per cent to its lowest level since last December, while the FTSE 350 Mining Index dropped 9.2 per cent to its lowest since July.Energy commodities also dropped sharply. In late trading in London, ICE November Brent, the global benchmark, fell $4.87 to $105.49 a barrel, while Nymex November West Texas Intermediate tumbled $5.41 to $80.51, after falling below $80 in intraday trading.The drop in mining equities was exacerbated by a warning from Alpha Natural Resources, a leading US coal producer, that it was likely to ship less coal than forecast this year because of “unexpectedly curtailed customer activity levels”. Alpha’s comments follow that of Rio Tinto chief executive Tom Albanese, whose remarks about weaker demand caused jitters among investors.But analysts and mining executives said that investors were wrong in comparing the current slowdown with the global financial crisis in 2008.Michael Lewis, head of commodities research at Deutsche Bank in London, said that compared with three years ago there was less leverage in the system and that trade credit had not frozen.Goldman Sachs, bullish on commodities, reiterated its upbeat view. “We continue to recommend an overweight positioning in commodities,” said Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research in London.Copper, which is closely linked with economic activity and sensitive to fluctuations in Chinese demand, hit a new low for the year. Copper for three month delivery on the London Metal Exchange fell below the psychological support of $8,000 a tonne, dropping 8.6 per cent to 7,620 a tonne.Other base metals were sharply lower, with tin falling at one point more than 10 per cent. Aluminium fell 4.4 per cent; lead dropped 6.2 per cent and nickel fell 10 per cent to the lowest level in a year.The health of the natural resources sector is critical for London’s stock market, where it accounts for nearly a third of the blue-chip FTSE 100’s market capitalisation. Commodities are also important in Sydney, São Paulo and Toronto.The fall in commodities prices dragged equities lower, with sharp falls in blue-chip stocks including BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining company by market capitalisation.BHP fell 8.3 per cent; Rio Tinto shares were down 10.8 per cent, while Xstrata dropped 9.6 per cent. New York-listed Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s second largest copper producer, tumbled 9.7 per cent, extending this week’s losses to 22.7 per cent.In oil, Total of France fell 5.7 per cent while BP dropped 4.9 per cent."
164;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-09-20T16:09:30Z;Mood of cautious optimism takes hold;Business slowly accepts president as early fears of an authoritarian approach seem to fade away;Ollanta Humala admits he sometimes looks in the mirror and cannot believe he is president. Members of the exclusive Club Nacional, styled on the English gentleman’s model and situated a few hundred metres from the presidential palace in central Lima, feel the same way.It has been less than four months since Mr Humala, a former army officer with no government experience, unexpectedly won the June 5 run-off. His narrow victory over centre-right candidate Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of a former president, sparked a record sell-off on the Lima stock exchange.Since then, Mr Humala has dispelled many of the concerns held by investors – including the buttoned-down businessmen lunching in the Club Nacional’s chandeliered dining rooms. “There is a mood of cautious optimism,” admits one.Even by Latin American standards, it has been a remarkably volatile year in Peru. It is the world’s second-biggest producer of copper, silver and zinc, and one of the globe’s fastest-growing economies, having trebled in size since 2000.Electoral tensions really began to heat up in April, after centrist candidates split the electorate and Mr Humala scooped up their votes in the first round. Local debt markets subsequently clammed up. Some feared Mr Humala’s rise in the polls might jeopardise the $42bn of investment that international mining companies – such as BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Freeport-McMoRan – were set to pour into Peru’s $168bn economy.Since then, markets have rebounded, the country’s debt rating has been upgraded and pledges of even more foreign investment have come in, after the little-known Mr Humala has proved not to be the bogeyman many feared he was.The 49-year-old has assembled a rainbow cabinet consisting of leftwing radicals and former military men, admixed with orthodox economists. Luis Miguel Castilla, the finance minister, served in the previous government. Julio Velarde, the widely respected head of the central bank, has been reappointed.“We are all very non-ideological,” says Salomón Lerner, a millionaire businessman who is Mr Humala’s prime minister. “What’s important is not the colour of the cat, but that it catches mice.”If at times Peruvians’ worries have seemed hysterical, it is with good reason. In 2000, Mr Humala, then a colonel, led a failed revolt against Alberto Fujimori, the president at the time. After he was pardoned, he ran in the 2006 elections, espousing the kind of socialist rhetoric bellowed by Venezuela’s radical president Hugo Chávez – and only narrowly lost.This year, advised by Brazilian political image-makers, he adopted a more moderate approach. Following former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s lead, he dropped talk of nationalising companies and spoke instead about economic centrism and social-inclusion policies for the poor.The rhetorical switch helped Mr Humala win the election. But it also left doubts about where his true instincts lay and whether his political make­over masked a latent authoritarianism.Such concerns are particularly pertinent in a country that is still traumatised by recent hyperinflation, insurgency and authoritarianism. After all, it was only in the mid-1990s that former president Fujimori, now serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights abuses, suppressed the Shining Path guerrillas and brought order to the macroeconomy.Everyone is wondering if there are any more shocks on the way, says Hernando de Soto, the internationally acclaimed Peruvian economist. “Yet, so far, the change in Mr Humala’s approach shows he realises he has to be the president of all Peruvians. That shows he is a smart politician.”Certainly, the president is going to need all the good ideas he can assemble if he is to deliver on his central promise of social inclusion, while keeping Peru’s commodity-heavy economy thrumming.Nobody disagrees with his government’s patently reasonable desire to fight corruption, beat crime and reduce poverty by expanding social services to the poorest regions, especially the Andes and Amazon. There, more than 200 social conflicts have flared up this year as indigenous groups have protested the impact of new mining projects.It will still be a delicate balancing act, however, to keep public finances trim, while meeting the high expectations Mr Humala has nurtured among his core constituency – the third of Peruvians who live on less than $4 a day.So far, the ramp-up in social spending he promised during his campaign has been well calibrated and carefully targeted. The government budget, which is running a surplus, can easily meet the extra $370m cost.A tax on windfall mining profits has also proved digestible – and followed a very un-Chávez-like consultation between the government and mining companies. Instead of seeking to raise $2bn-3bn as companies had feared, the extra tax bill is about $1.1bn.As a political outsider, Mr Humala has so far turned to a close circle for advice, in particular his wife, Nadine Heredia, and the prime minister. The 35-year-old Ms Heredia is telegenic, grew up in the same area as Mr Humala and accompanies her husband to all high-profile state functions. She has his ear.The president’s appointment of former military colleagues to key advisory positions has been more controversial. “This stirs understandable fears,” says one western diplomat. “But it’s also understandable that Mr Humala has gone first to those he knows best – and it may be that they will also prove good at their jobs.”It is all part of the ambiguity that surrounds Peru’s new president. He wants to strengthen the role of the state, but at the same time the state is renowned for its corruption and inefficiency. Improving it is the work of generations, not a single presidency.Indeed, as consecutive terms are not allowed under the constitution, many wonder if his wife might run in 2016, allowing Mr Humala to return again in 2021 – just as the Kirchner husband-and-wife team sought to do in Argentina. When asked, he replies that it is too early to say.For now, high commodity prices give his new government the financial elbow room to be all things to all people. Growth remains high – a 6-7 per cent expansion is forecast for this year and 5-6 per cent for 2012.A “strategic alliance” with Brazil will see the continent’s largest country build roads linking its agricultural markets to the Pacific, benefiting from Peru’s many free-trade agreements with the US and Asia. This could even turn Peru into “one of the most dynamic regions on earth”, says Walter Molano, head of research at BCP Securities, the emerging-markets focused investment bank.Nonetheless, sceptics worry about what would happen if Mr Humala’s popularity sagged, or commodity prices collapsed. Then he could launch into greater state intervention and become the populist authoritarian many fear he is at heart.“While commodity prices are high, he can be a Lula,” says Moisés Naím, a senior associate in the Carnegie Endowment think-tank’s economics programme in Washington, DC. “Should they fall, he could become a Chávez.”So far, Mr Humala has followed the Brazilian script. He has been fiscally prudent and politically pragmatic. There is little evidence – yet – that he will not continue that way.
165;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-09-12T21:21:04Z;China bond-buying hopes drive Wall Street up;;The S&P 500 ended the day in positive territory for only the second time this month after a late surge of buying on a Financial Times report that Italy is in talks with Chinese officials about a possible investment in its sovereign bonds.The benchmark index climbed 0.7 per cent to 1,162.27, snapping two days of losses.The index had been in negative territory for almost the entire day, falling a full percentage point in early trading. But news that the world’s second-largest economy might be riding to the rescue of a distressed European government triggered a strong rally, 30 minutes before the close of trading.Cautious analysts warned that the rally could be undone on Tuesday, once investors have time to reflect on Chinese involvement, which is unconfirmed.“Whatever the Chinese might or might not have done today, the hole in European sovereign financing is daunting and the potential for contagion is huge. Investors should keep very cautious,” said Channing Smith at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Banks were the main beneficiaries of the rally. The financial component of the S&P 500 had fallen hard in early trading, trading ominously near its year-low of 158.91, touched on August 23. But at the close, financials were up 1.2 per cent, second only to tech stocks.Regional banks performed particularly well, with PNC Financial Services up 3.8 per cent to $48.16 after presenting to investors at a Barclays Capital conference.Bank of America rallied 1 per cent to $7.05, outperforming its peers, as investors welcomed the downsizing plan unveiled by chief executive Brian Moynihan.But Morgan Stanley fell 1.5 per cent to $15.05.Bank stocks in the S&P 500, which continue to be dogged by fears of exposure to European peers and mortgage-related lawsuits, are still only up 5 per cent from their year-low last month.On Monday, Glenn Schorr, Nomura’s US banks analyst, tried to put a figure on the losses banks face from the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s litigation over the misselling of securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.“While the suits read badly, we took a bottom-up and security-by-security approach on over 700 securities covered in the suits …and believe that the loss recoupment number for the industry is more likely in the $9bn-$20bn range, versus the $25bn-$40bn estimates we have seen, with our bias more at the low end,” Mr Schorr said.“Given the significant costs to litigate these claims”, Mr Schorr also predicted the case is likely to end in a settlement, costing the banks about $10bn, rather than litigation.McGraw-Hill Companies shares rose 4 per cent to $40.26, as the company bowed to pressure from activist hedge fund investor Jana Partners, to split in two to maximise shareholder value.Semiconductor stocks also performed strongly. Micron Technology rose 5.3 per cent to $6.69, SanDisk Corp added 3.3 per cent to $40.02.The Philadelphia index of 30 semiconductor companies rose 3 per cent to 358.96. It has recovered nearly 10 per cent from its August year-low. The strong performance of a sector closely linked to prospects for global growth suggested some optimism among investors.In another sign of positive sentiment, shares in Newmont, the gold miner, were off 1.9 per cent at $64.07. Newmont shares are considered a bet on rising gold prices, so only tend to fall if the S&P 500 is rising on investor confidence.Freeport-McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, also fell 1.6 per cent to $41.31, as talks continued to avert a strike at its mines in Peru.Those two companies pushed material stocks down 0.8 per cent, the only sector in the S&P 500 to fall.Tenet Healthcare was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, down 10 per cent at $4.52, after the Dallas company warned earnings would be at the lower end of estimates. The company blamed growing admissions through Medicaid, the government’s health programme for low earners, which offers relatively low reimbursement.Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare product company, fell 0.1 per cent to $63.59 after failing to win clearance for wider use of Simponi, a two-year-old arthritis drug.Yahoo fell 1.5 per cent to $14.26, as sacked former chief executive Carol Bartz said she would leave the company’s board of directors .
166;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-09-04T15:03:05Z;Business braced for Chile tax rise;;Companies in Chile, the world’s largest copper producer, are bracing themselves for tax hikes amid expectations that the centre-right government will be forced to bow to pressure for education reform.Sebastián Piñera, the president, has stuck to his guns during more than three months of convulsive protests by students seeking free public education and though no firm tax plans are on the table yet, government sources concede a new increase cannot be ruled out.Mr Piñera, whose popularity has slumped to a historic low of 26 per cent 18 months after taking office, says free public education for all is “neither appropriate nor fair” but he has offered to slash the interest rate on student loans and increase grants to help address long-standing problems with the system.He raised taxes last year to 20 per cent from 17 per cent to fund reconstruction after a devastating earthquake. The rate was intended to revert to 17 per cent in two years but Santiago’s business community now sees few alternatives to another hike.“I think it is taking shape within the political sector and also the economic sector that the 20 per cent will remain,” says Marcelo Awad, chief executive of Antofagasta, the London-listed Chilean mining company, in a view shared by other mining companies. “And one of the reasons it will remain is to finance education.”Mr Piñera held four hours of talks with university leaders and student representatives on Saturday, which both sides welcomed as positive. The government will on Monday present more detailed proposals.“At the end of the day, if you want something you have to pay for it. If you want to have a developed economy, taxes will need to go up,” noted César Pérez-Novoa, head of research at Celfin Capital, a Chilean brokerage.However, any new hike – perhaps even to 21 per cent – was likely to be across-the-board, rather than targeting mining companies specifically, despite near-record commodity prices that have prompted tax grabs in other countries and a new wave of “resource nationalism”.Peru’s government is currently finalising the details of a new mining royalty that it says will raise an extra $1.1bn a year in tax revenues, while Bolivia’s deputy mining minister last week said that it, too, was planning a mining royalty. Australia and the UK have also lifted taxes on commodity producers.Chile, which supplies a third of the world’s copper, is the destination of large investments by most of the world’s top miners, including BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Xstrata, Freeport-McMoRan and Barrick Gold. Last year, it amended the royalty scheme and mining companies are expected to pay about $11bn in taxes this year – a quarter of total government revenues.“It will be difficult to put another royalty on mining companies,” says Patricio Navia, of New York University.However, some industry observers fear Peru’s move could lend legitimacy to another rise in Chile.“I am sure the mining guys would like to stay below the radar, but I don’t think they’ll be able to. It’s very hard to explain why Chile has such a low tax rate compared to Peru,” says Juan Carlos Guajardo, executive director of Cesco, Chile’s copper industry think-tank. He reckons the overall tax burden on the mining industry in Chile is currently 43 per cent, compared to 48 per cent in Peru before the new tax.Foreign mining companies hope the government will shield them from any change by keeping the overall rate of tax on profits distributed abroad at 35 per cent.In that case, a rise in taxes would affect only the portion of their profits reinvested in Chile. If the corporate tax rate were raised to 20 per cent, but the overall rate remained at 35 per cent, the net impact on foreign miners would be roughly 1 per cent of their profits, analysts estimate.
167;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-09-02T17:40:54Z;Economic concerns take shine off copper rally;;A combination of supply constraints and concerns about global growth conspired to leave copper prices almost unchanged after a burst of strength earlier in the week.On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three months rose 0.2 per cent to $9,084.75 a tonne, pulling back from a midweek high of $9,258 after surveys that showed global manufacturers were stumbling were followed by a disappointing US payrolls report.The metal, known for its strong correlation with global growth trends, was buoyed by expectations of tight supply.With heavy rains affecting output in Australia earlier in the year, and labour disputes affecting production in Chile and threatening it in Indonesia, many analysts are considering a reduction to supply forecasts for 2011.Data showed Peru’s production of copper and zinc fell in July as the quality of newly extracted ores declines. In Chile, the world’s biggest producer, output fell 18 per cent in July, a surprisingly steep decline. For the seven months to July, copper production was 2.95m tonnes, 4.2 per cent lower than in the same period in 2010.The figures reflected a strike of more than two weeks at Escondida, the world’s biggest copper mine, which ended early last month and caused some 40,000 tonnes in lost production.Sign up here to receive the daily commodities note direct to your e-mail inboxA continuing labour dispute and the threat of a strike at Freeport-McMoRan’s Grasberg mine, a key mine on a mountain top in Indonesia, have also added upward pressure on copper prices. Prices had hit an eight-month low of $8,446 a tonne in early August, but since then they have recovered as investors turned their focus on expectations of fresh buying from China. Senior executives at trading houses, mining companies and banks this week said Chinese consumers had used the recent drop in prices to rebuild stocks.However, copper traders were spooked late in the week by macroeconomic concerns after reports showed a deterioration in Chinese export orders for August, a weakening manufacturing sector and persistently high US unemployment. With economic clouds looming, the question is whether copper will be able to maintain current price levels in the face of mounting evidence of a slowdown or possible double-dip recession.“We’ve seen from recessions in the past that it doesn’t matter how tight the market is – we will see the price coming off,” said Walter de Wet, commodities strategist at Standard Bank.In the case of a global recession, the red metal could briefly fall below $8,000, but at those levels, there would be plenty of buyers, said Mr de Wet.
168;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-08-31T21:20:40Z;Wall Street mixed on homebuilder strength;;Homebuilder stocks diverged after analysts made different calls on the housing market and which business models are likely to prosper.UBS analyst David Goldberg upgraded several companies and said the market for new homes had certainly bottomed.“Several valuations in the sector suggest the new homes market will get a lot worse [but] we believe fundamentals are at – or near – a trough.” Mr Goldberg said,Mr Goldberg upgraded Lennar from hold to buy, arguing the homebuilder’s financial arm, Rialto, which invests in distressed property assets, will benefit if the housing market recovers. Lennar shares were up 0.3 per cent at $14.70.Mr Goldberg also upgraded DR Horton to buy from hold as the management’s “focus on driving volumes, including emphasising [speculative] construction” gives it inventory to sell.He reduced his target price for KB Home from $11 to $7, because “management’s commitment to a build-to-order model …will probably lead to slower growth in a stable housing market”.DR Horton stocks fell 0.8 per cent to $10.52 while KB Home was down 2.2 per cent to $6.59.But other analysts did not agree that builders with aggressive strategies will outperform.“I wouldn’t be recommending their shares,” said Michael Widner, of Stifel Nicolaus. “The new homes market has been in a trough for 18 months now and we don’t know when it will turn.“Companies are adjusting to what could be a new normal of low demand for two to three years and it is prudent to do so.”Mr Widner recommended buying homebuilders with relatively little debt. “If demand stays weak, at least their balance sheets won’t be continually eroded by payments to service debt.”Mr Widner said DR Horton had one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector.He also said companies like NVR, which buy options to develop land, rather than buying land outright, are less dependent on rising demand.“NVR isn’t taking a bet on whether land prices will go up or down“NVR outperformed the sector, off just 0.04 per cent on the day at $636.50. Meritage Homes, another builder that prefers options to buying land, only fell 0.1 per cent to $18.99.Mr Goldberg upgraded Meritage from sell to hold, arguing that its “land light model, which focuses on optioning lots” should protect it from “further downside”.The broad S&P index rose 0.5 per cent to 1,218.87, as the ADP Employer Services survey suggested private companies added 91,000 workers to payrolls in August. The index has now made gains for four consecutive days, the longest rally since late June.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.5 per cent to 11,613.76, putting it in positive territory for the year, for the first time since the start of August.The Nasdaq Composite index of technology stocks rose 0.1 per cent to 2,579.46.AT&T shares fell 3.9 per cent to $28.48 after the Department of Justice moved to block the company’s proposed $39bn takeover of T-Mobile USA.Shares in Verizon, the largest US mobile phone network, fell 0.4 per cent to $36.17.But Sprint, the third-largest network, which would be dwarfed by both AT&T and Verizon if the deal went through, spiked 5.9 per cent to $3.76.Industrial stocks outperformed the index by rising 0.7 per cent after mining equipment manufacturer Joy Global reported quarterly earnings per share of $1.54, 4 cents higher than expected. Its shares was up 1.3 per cent to $83.45.Materials stocks in the S&P 500 underperformed, up only 0.3 per cent, after Goldman Sachs analyst Sal Tharani cutting price targets by an average 24 per cent across the sector because of weak demand from developed economies.Mr Tharani recommended buying Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold stock on expected high demand for copper.Mr Tharani also recommended buying aluminium producer Alcoa.Alcoa shares were up 3.6 per cent to $12.80 and Freeport rose 1.1 per cent to $47.11.The biggest riser on Wednesday was electronic broker E Trade Financial, after Rich Repetto, a Sandler O’Neill analyst, told clients that daily average revenue trades, or DARTs, in the electronic retail investor market rose 40 per cent month on month in August.
169;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-08-30T21:06:07Z;China intensifies purchases of copper;Chile and Peru experience benefits;Chinese companies and investors are stepping up their purchases of industrial commodities such as copper, in a show of confidence in the global economy that stands in contrast to the turmoil in western markets.The wave of buying is providing support for metals and minerals prices after commodities prices fell this month at worries about a double-dip. Senior executives at trading houses, mining companies and banks said Chinese consumers had used the recent drop in prices to rebuild stocks.“China is significantly less pessimistic relative to people in the western world,” said Raymond Key, head of metals trading at Deutsche Bank. “On dips they are restocking, especially in copper.” An executive at an important Chinese trading house added: “There is no doubt some traders have been buying [copper] recently.”The surge in copper buying benefits the largest exporting nations, including top producers Chile and Peru, and miners such as Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold, BHP Billiton and Xstrata, and trading houses such as Glencore and Trafigura.Copper prices fell to a 8-month low of $8,446 a tonne in early August, but since then prices have risen more than 9.0 per cent to $9,225 on Tuesday.China accounts for 38 per cent of global copper demand, and as such has the power to almost single-handedly prop up the market even if companies in the west are holding back. Nonetheless, traders warned that Chinese buyers could rapidly step back from the market if they believed prices would fall further.The buying by China marks a reversal of the trend in the first half of this year, when consumers in the country made minimal purchases of metals such as copper, choosing instead to run down their inventories as the government’s drive to tighten credit reduced their ability to import large volumes. China’s net copper imports in the first seven months of the year were down 37 per cent from the same period in 2010.Glencore, the world’s largest commodities trader, said that so-called bonded warehouses stockpiles had seen a “significant drawdown”. It estimated that stocks have “at least halved” since the beginning of the year.The strength of demand by China in the past four-to-six weeks has been buoyed by a jump in the strength of the renminbi, which makes importing commodities cheaper for Chinese traders. Western traders said that some large Chinese buyers had been able to access credit more easily, enabling larger purchases – although they cautioned that credit is still tight for smaller companies.“We have seen our Chinese counterparties [have] been able to open significantly larger letters of credit than in the first half of the year,” a senior trading executive in Geneva said, referring to a typical financial instrument used on trading.In a sign of China’s increased appetite for copper, the price of the red metal at the nearby hubs of South Korea and Singapore has in the past two weeks jumped relative to the benchmark London Metal Exchange’s price, brokers said.
170;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-08-30T13:05:00Z;Copper strengthens on supply concerns;;Copper prices firmed on Tuesday, as worries over a global economic slowdown faded on positive US data, and investors focused on expectations of tighter supply.Copper for three month delivery on the London Metal Exchange rose 0.78 per cent to $9,140 per tonne in London midday trading as investors moved to cover short positions.Gayle Berry, base metals analyst at Barclays Capital, said data indicating strong fundamentals for copper had prompted a relief rally. With some of the macro economic concerns fading, investors were focused on lower production figures and lower inventories in China, she said. Prices firmed last week after inventory data in Shanghai showed declines in every metal.Data showing Peruvian production of copper and zinc falling in July due to lower ore grades at key mines and the continuing labour dispute and the threat of a strike at Indonesia’s Freeport-McMoRan’s Grasberg mine, a key mine on a mountaintop in Indonesia, has also added upward pressure on copper prices. The eight-day strike in July at Grasberg led to a production loss of 35m pounds of copper and 60,000 ounces of goldWith bad weather conditions and labour disputes, many analysts have already used much of their production allowances for 2011, which will force them to revise down their production forecasts.Other industrial metals were also firm, with aluminium for three month delivery on the LME up 0.5 per cent to $2,392 a tonne and zinc up 1.47 per cent to $2,285.Gold fluctuated around the $1,800 level, rising 1.37 per cent to $1811.49 a troy ounce, while crude oil eased on a higher dollar, with ICE October Brent, the benchmark oil price, down $0.32 to $11.56 and the Nymex September West Texas Intermediate $0.68 lower at $86.58.
171;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-08-25T22:17:23Z;Peru to impose extra tax on mining groups;;Peru’s government is to wring an extra $1.1bn of taxes from the country’s mining sector, making the Andean country the latest resource-rich nation to demand a greater share of the commodities boom.The decision, announced by prime minister Salomón Lerner in a speech to Congress on Thursday, brings to an end two months of hard-fought negotiations between mining companies and the new government.Industry executives were relieved by the outcome, saying the new tax was less punitive than they had feared and would maintain Peru’s competitiveness with neighbouring Chile.Some of the world’s largest mining companies – including London-listed BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Glencore, as well as Freeport-McMoRan of the US and Grupo Mexico – have big investments in the country.The election victory in June of Ollanta Humala, the leftwing candidate who had promised a windfall tax on the mining sector, rattled the nerves of investors and caused a sharp drop in the share prices of Peruvian mining companies.The shift to “resource nationalism” on the back of record commodity prices also extends to the nation’s gas reserves. Mr Lerner said the government would block the export of gas from the major block of the Camisea concession, lead by Pluspetrol of Argentina. He also announced that construction on a southern gas pipeline would begin next year.Peru is the second-largest producer of copper, silver and zinc, as well as being a significant source of gold, lead and tin. It returned to gas-exporting status last year with the opening of a $3.8bn liquefied natural gas plant.Mr Lerner did not say whether the extra revenue from the mining sector would be in the form of taxes or royalties, or when the new arrangement would come into effect.“We want to announce today that we have ensured mining companies will make tax payments of approximately 3bn soles [$1.1bn] a year,” Mr Lerner said.Roque Benavides, chief executive of Buenaventura, Peru’s biggest publicly traded mining company, confirmed the tax would be applied to profits.“It’s good the [talks] have come to fruition so that we can contribute more, based on extraordinary profits,” he told local radio. “The mining sector is willing to contribute without affecting competitiveness.”The government has softened its position significantly since the early stages of negotiations, when it had been seeking to raise an additional $2bn-$3bn, according to people familiar with the discussions.Nonetheless, miners estimated the new tax would be equivalent to an additional 3-5 per cent of operating profits and would increase the government’s tax take from the sector by about a fifth. The actual rate paid will be scaled according to each company’s operating margin.The mining industry has been negotiating as a bloc, threatening to pull some of their $42bn planned investment over the next five years if the government imposed too harsh a tax rate. Moreover, companies with stability agreements, which give them immunity to tax changes, have offered to pay the new tax on a voluntary basis.Luis Miguel Castilla, finance minister, told the Financial Times that any new mining taxes or royalties would not threaten competitiveness, and that the additional revenues would be distributed by central government to poor regions.Social conflict in Peru is frequently related to environmental issues. Violent rolling protests through May and June saw the cancellation of Southern Copper’s $1bn Tia Maria project, Bear Creek of Canada’s Santa Ana silver project, and Egasur of Brazil’s $4bn Inambari hydroelectric dam.
172;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-08-10T20:56:48Z;US stocks resume downturn;;US equities once again fell sharply on Wednesday, wiping out a late-Tuesday rally that many had hoped would represent a bottom to August’s steep declines.Financials continued to lead the move lower, dropping 7.1 per cent as a sector by the close. Citigroup fell 10.5 per cent to $28.49, and Bank of America fell 6.8 per cent to $6.77.The major indices ended the session at the day’s lows, with S&P 500 index falling 4.4 per cent to 1,120.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.6 per cent to 10,719.48, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 4.1 per cent to 2,381.05.The chief executive of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, sought to allay fears. On Wednesday he said the bank would seek to pay a dividend as soon as possible, and said it would not seek new equity capital.But the two largest US financial institutions, seen as highly sensitive to a US economic slowdown, only endured further volatility. Wednesday’s losses wiped out the brief rally in the shares on Tuesday, bringing them back near their lows seen after a 20 per cent correction on Monday.Leading financial declines on Wednesday were regional banks. Regions Financial fell 11.5 per cent to $4.23, and SunTrust slipped 11.5 per cent to $5.80. Wells Fargo, seen as one of the better-capitalised banks, still fell 7.7 per cent, to $22.88.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets recommended that investors should keep buying bank stocks. “It is important to remember that bank fundamentals are strong and we believe they are getting stronger,” they wrote.However, they also warned that regulatory uncertainty was weighing on the stocks. “The Federal Reserve needs to provide the [systemically important financial institution] buffers and a timetable to reach them,” they wrote.The troubles of large European banks weighed as well. France’s credit rating, much as the US’s was earlier this week, is feared to be vulnerable as European countries are all called to fund bail-outs to “peripheral” economies such as Greece.Glenn Schorr, analyst at Nomura, said: “Despite the low valuations, we believe macro concerns will probably keep buyers on the sidelines in the near term”.There were gains in the sector, however, unlike in previous sessions. Capital One, the consumer lender and credit card group, agreed to acquire the US card businesses of HSBC for $30bn, which follows its earlier $9bn deal to buy ING’s US deposit unit. It is now among the five largest consumer depositaries in the US. The shares rose 0.7 per cent to $41.05.“This is a strong acquisition for Capital One and complements the ING acquisition,” said analysts at Citigroup.AvalonBay Communications, the property management group, was up 0.1 per cent to $125.67, after it was named as a possible buyer of rival Archstone, still owned by the bankrupt Lehman Brothers estate.The market had initially slipped to new lows on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve announced it would hold rates near zero until 2013, but did not extend any additional liquidity programmes.After the S&P 500 dropped to just above 1,100, many traders stepped in to close shorts, believing that the Fed’s promise of liquidity could be a catalyst for gains. But the market quickly resumed its initial move at Wednesday’s open.“The Fed did not commit to a third round [of quantitative easing] yesterday. Some traders seeking a bottom may have inferred they were likely to do so, but they didn’t do that,” said Clark Yingst, chief market strategist at Joseph Gunnar.Mr Yingst said that energy groups and other commodity-linked companies would benefit the most if investors believed “QE3” of some form was imminent. “Hard assets will be what people are seeking if there is ultimately going to be a round three of easing,” he said.ExxonMobil, the crude oil giant, was down 4.4 per cent at $68.03 on Wednesday, and Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was down 3.3 per cent at $43.55.Materials groups CF Industries, the fertiliser producer, and Newmont Mining, the gold producer, were among the market’s most resilient performers, as the sector outperformed, down 3.3 per cent. CF’s shares were off by 0.3 per cent at $149.59 and Newmont added 0.7 per cent to $55.81.Retailer Macy’s succumbed to the sell-off, dropping 3.6 per cent to $24.52, despite the department store chain raising its full-year earnings forecast from $2.45 to as much as $2.65 a share.Polo Ralph Lauren, the apparel designer, added 4.5 per cent to $125.28 after it topped analyst expectations by earning $1.90 for the quarter, versus forecasts of $1.47.Walt Disney fell 9.1 per cent to $31.54 as the entertainment and media group missed forecasts for its revenues this quarter. Sales totalled $1.62bn, versus $1.83bn that had been forecast.Analysts at Nomura lowered their price target from $45 to $42 a share. “The stock is likely to be range-bound unless the macro outlook brightens or earnings begin to beat expectations again,” they said.
173;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-08-05T19:50:14Z;Escondida strike to end;;Workers at BHP Billiton’s Escondida, the world’s biggest copper mine, will return to work on Saturday after the end of a two-week strike branded illegal by the company that cost 40,000 tonnes in lost production and fuelled fears of global supply shortages, the union said.Executives in the industry fear the strike, called on July 21 outside the stipulated collective bargaining period, will be a test case for other mine workers emboldened to take action to get a bigger share of record world copper prices.The stoppage at Escondida, which supplies about 7 per cent of the world’s copper, is just one of a recent rash of strikes by copper miners worldwide that has robbed the copper market of desperately needed supplies. Some analysts now believe mined copper production will be lower in 2011 than 2010 due to the disruptions in supplies.“This is a signal to the rest of the unions and workers that you can negotiate and improve labour and social conditions outside the regulation negotiation period,” Roberto Arriagada, director of the Escondida union, told the FT.“It’s a great step forward in collective negotiations,” he added. The company undertook not to fire or take reprisals against any workers and to pay all strike days. Escondida also agreed there had been no damages to the mine installations, he said.But, seeking to save face, Escondida stressed that workers had accepted a discretionary bonus of 2.65m pesos ($5,700), lower than that first offered by the company.Escondida workers accepted a bonus of 2.65m pesos ($5,700), in line with a revised offer from the company, but lower than both the original offer of 2.8m pesos and the union’s initial demands of 5m pesos. And though they will be paid for strike days, the company stressed that it was only the basic rate.“Operations at Escondida are beginning to return to normal as employees return to work after the end of the illegal industrial action recently called by the union. This follows constructive conversations between the parties,” it said in a statement.Escondida added that it remained committed to a “positive relationship with its workers based on dialogue and mutual respect”, and though it had agreed not to exercise a clause in contracts that would allow it to fire workers that have missed work because of the strike, it would take legal action against any criminal activity.The benchmark copper price has soared this year to more than $9,000 per tonne amid soaring demand from China and other industrialising countries needing great quantities of copper for wiring in construction and telecoms.But global growth fears have taken the copper price lower in recent days. It fell from $9,355 per tonne on Thursday to below $9,100 in early afternoon trading on the London Metal Exchange.BHP, the controlling shareholder of an Escondida consortium that also includes Rio Tinto, has reportedly lost around 3,000 tonnes of copper per day from the Escondida stoppage and was forced to declare force majeure – a contract clause often used after floods or earthquakes that removes liability for delays in delivery – on its sales of copper concentrates.Chile saw a one-day stoppage by workers at the state copper corporation, Codelco, last month as well as a stoppage at the Collahuasi mine, while in Indonesia, Freeport-McMoRan faced a strike at its Grasberg mine as workers seek to share the mining companies’ windfall gains from the red metal.Government officials in Antofagasta, the hub of the Chilean copper industry, informed Escondida workers on July 28 that their strike was illegal. According to people close to the situation, Chile’s government did not intervene as forcefully as it might have, because of the political sensitivities involved in defending a cash-rich foreign mining company.Sebastián Piñera, the president, is also struggling to contain other unrest, including violent protests by students, that have hammered his approval rating to a 31 per cent low.
174;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-08-04T18:05:08Z;Resource stocks take market’s full impact;;Even by the standards of the recent financial crisis, Thursday’s sell-off in stock markets was sizeable.The growing nervousness over the debt crisis in Europe, the risk of a “double-dip” recession in America and a view among investors that policymakers, including the Japanese government and European Central Bank, had failed to shore up confidence accelerated this week’s sell-off.The worst hit stocks were those of the world’s big natural resources groups, including miners, oil companies and traders. Despite the prices of many commodities remaining near recent highs, their shares prices tumbled, sending valuations to the lowest levels of the year.The divergence between resources stocks and the prices of actual raw materials evokes memories of mid-2008, when equity investors were quicker in anticipating the global financial crisis.Are equity investors right again? If so, a sharp economic slowdown, or worse, could be at hand. Other sectors, such as financial services, suffered steep falls too on concern over their exposure to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the risk of more bad loans.There’s a lot of market noise, that’s distracting people from the real economic fundamentals. These are unambiguously weaker in all big economies. This is a validation of a low yield environment and is good for bondsThe list of tumbling resources stocks on Thursday included Xstrata, the London-listed miner, which fell 8.5 per cent, Royal Dutch Shell, Europe’s largest oil group, which fell 5.2 per cent, and Vale of Brazil, the largest iron ore producer, which dropped 6.3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan, a top copper miner, fell 5.9 per cent and Archer Daniels Midland, one of the largest food commodities traders, was 4.5 per cent lower.After two weeks of heavy losses, the FTSE All World Mining and the FTSE all World Oil and Gas indices are up just 7.6 and 14.6 per cent, respectively, over the past year.In the same period, the benchmark Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a basket of commodities including oil, copper and wheat, is up 22.1 per cent.I don’t mean to trivialise things but equities can go up and down. You start to get worried by bond markets getting out of control. I still don’t see things spiralling that wildly out of control. There is nothing central banks can doGlencore, the world’s largest commodities trader, which came to the market in a $60bn flotation in May, is among those hardest hit. The company has lost 17.9 per cent so far this week. On Thursday, it closed at 391p, more than 26 per cent below its flotation price and 8 per cent down on the day.Equity investors appear far more concerned about the potential of a double-dip than commodities investors, according to industry executives.Investors say that high oil and food prices are forcing emerging countries’ central banks to tighten monetary policy, slowing economic growth in China, India and other big commodities consumers. That has compounded the negative sentiment surrounding the eurozone crisis and US fiscal burden.“We began the year expecting slow but persisting growth in mature economies with China compensating by continuing with its robust growth,” says Jon Bergtheil, mining analyst at Citigroup. “Those assumptions are being called into question”.Look at US growth and Italian bond markets and you’ve got a lot of the story. The US ability to dig itself out is crucial, and where Italian bond markets go, so goes global risk appetiteBut Colin P. Fenton, head of commodities research at JPMorgan in New York, warns against being too gloomy. “The global economy is weathering a soft patch, but is likely not heading into a double-dip recession”.Commodities prices are starting to fall, although from historically high levels. Brent crude, for example, fell on Thursday to a 5-week low, yet it remains about 40 per cent higher than in January 2010.Economic fears aside, another important factor behind the sharp falls in commodity-related share prices has been rising production costs, which have eroded companies’ profitability even as the selling prices of the raw materials they produce have increased. Tom Albanese, chief executive at Rio Tinto, said on Thursday that the sector was suffering from inflation hot spots: “Coupled with the increasing strength of the Australian and Canadian dollars, this has put pressure on our cost base.”The impact of that rising cost inflation is clear in iron ore. The price of the steelmaking commodity hit a 2½-month high of $179.5 a tonne on Thursday, up nearly 30 per cent year-on-year. Yet shares in the world’s largest ore miners – Vale of Brazil, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton – have tumbled 10-12 per cent this week.Other factors are weighing on share prices. Oil and mining groups have produced less than expected due to bad weather – for example, flooding in Australia – and labour disputes including strikes in South Africa’s mining sector, as well as political turmoil such as the civil war in oil-rich Libya. The resulting supply shortfalls have lifted commodities prices, but are eroding profitability as companies miss production targets.Total of France, Eni of Italy and Repsol YPF of Spain produced oil in Libya before the civil war started. Their net profits fell year on year in the second quarter despite higher year on year Brent crude prices. The boom in resources stocks already feels like history.
175;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-08-01T09:03:32Z;Only two numbers matter for mining groups;Spot iron ore and copper prices will set the tone for reporting season;Investors in diversified mining companies can understand this month’s earnings season by keeping two numbers in mind: 175 and 9,800.Those are today’s spot prices of iron ore ($175 per tonne) and copper ($9,800 per tonne). Mining and selling these two commodities has become a licence to print money. Last week’s financial updates from Freeport-McMoRan, Anglo American, and Vale all attest to this, and they point the way for Xstrata, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton.The money is in the margin. It costs Rio and BHP – the second- and third-largest iron ore producers – between $30-$40 to produce one tonne of iron ore in their Pilbara mines in Australia. They are selling in to a market that is paying five times that amount on a spot basis. In the six months to June Freeport sold its copper at prices that were on average 4.5 times more than its production cost per pound.In the resurgent boom of the past year many industrial commodities have hit a hot streak of price appreciation. In some ways the gains from coking coal have been more impressive than iron ore or copper. But these two commodities – which show up in every new city and apartment high-rise in China – are driving the profits of the majors like never before.Iron ore and copper delivered $3.9bn in first-half operating profits at Anglo, or 65 per cent of the total, with iron ore leading the way.Looking ahead to Rio Tinto, iron ore and base metals (a division that includes copper) are forecast to generate around 85 per cent of the diversified miner’s earnings. JP Morgan forecasts operating profits of $7bn from iron ore alone, compared to an interim total of $10bn.Other analysts see copper contributing about half of Xstrata’s operating profits in the first half.These two commodities’ strength may reflect timing in the commodities cycle. Infrastructure-heavy commodities like iron ore have historically picked up faster than late-cycle commodities like platinum, which is used in cars, electronics, and jewellery. The first half of 2011 may be near the beginning of the post-crisis industrial cycle, pointing the way for these early risers to revert to normal prices by 2013 or so.But it is becoming more mainstream in past months to view these commodities as supercyclical– and capable of driving the miners’ earnings for years to come. For copper, the argument rests on a dearth of new mines, endemic worker strikes, and a mining base whose old-warhorse deposits are deteriorating rapidly in quality.On the iron ore side, a more controversial supercycle theory holds that a rash of project delays will combine with cooling-but-still-hot Chinese steel consumption to keep the price above $150 per tonne for many years to come. Wood Mackenzie, the commodities consultancy, lent credence to the theory this month by writing about the iron ore market: “We think a supply deficit is inevitable until at least 2015.”Vale, the world’s biggest iron ore miner, announced last week it would pay a $3bn extra dividend to cope with its windfall gains. This is much like Antofagasta and Freeport, which have paid special dividends this year from copper.Rio, BHP, Anglo, and Xstrata all have swing commodities, or divisions that differentiate them from the others and push their earnings one way or another. For Rio it is aluminium, for BHP it is oil and gas, for Anglo it is platinum, and for Xstrata ferrochrome. But it may be some time before any of these divisions seriously encroach on copper and iron ore (a commodity Xstrata does not produce).There is another metal that is doing extremely well, but for different reasons.To understand the bonanza enjoyed by Barrick, Newmont and AngloGold Ashanti, all investors have to do is remember one number: 1,600.
176;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-07-28T19:46:40Z;BHP Billiton digs in against striking miners;;BHP Billiton has declared force majeure on exports from the world’s biggest copper mine, as a mineworkers’ strike entered its eighth day.The strike at BHP’s Escondida mine in Chile, which supplied 7 per cent of the world’s copper last year, comes in a month of widespread mining strikes from Indonesia to South Africa.The declaration of force majeure – often used after floods or earthquakes – frees BHP of its obligation to supply customers with copper until operations resume. A prolonged strike at Escondida threatens to affect supply chains for the industrial metal, which is heavily used in construction and electronics, and add pressure to the spot copper price.BHP appeared to dig in this week. It has declined to negotiate since industrial action started on July 21. Workers want annual bonuses of 5m pesos ($11,000) each compared to BHP’s offer of a 2.8m peso bonus.The Escondida strike is illegal, according to a BHP official, because it occurs outside Chile’s permissible periods for collective bargaining. The union agreed a four-year contract in 2009 and can review compensation in 2013, BHP said.The copper price has risen sharply since 2009. Today’s prices above $9,500 per tonne have boosted profits for copper miners and inspired unions to ask for a bigger share of gains.Operating profits at Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s biggest listed copper miner, rose 64 per cent to $5.7bn in the first six months of this year. The company’s operating profit margin was 50 per cent.In early July, workers at Grasberg, Freeport’s biggest mine in Indonesia, went on strike for eight days after demanding higher pay.Workers at Codelco, the Chilean state-owned copper miner, staged a one-day strike this month and threatened more walkouts.“There is a perception in the mining sector that the big mining companies are making too much money at the moment,” said Rob Clifford, mining analyst at Deutsche Bank. “So they are subject to scrutiny by all their stakeholders: by staff demanding more pay, by governments demanding more taxes, and by shareholders demanding more returns.”Referring to the Escondida mine in Chile, he added: “This strike feels different. It is not just about haggling over a number. It is about a principle. The principle is whether this type of strike is legal or not, and whether agreed frameworks for negotiation can be discarded.”The spot price of copper has risen 3.5 per cent since July 1, as reports of industrial action add to concerns about an already strained supply base.
177;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-07-26T18:19:48Z;Chile mine strike raises fears for copper supply;Prices of the metal rose as a dispute entered its fifth day;Copper prices rose on Tuesday as a strike at the world’s largest mine of the metal entered its fifth day, stoking worries of a stalemate which could reduce supplies.The Escondida mine, located in the Atacama desert in Chile, accounts for around 7 per cent of global copper production. Although the strike has been, so far, too short to have a meaningful impact on physical copper markets, investors and traders worry that the lack of negotiations between the miners and the company could lead to a prolonged outage and potentially extend to other mines.RBC Capital Markets said in a note to clients that the strike was providing some support to the copper market, but warned: “These industrial actions are generally short lived.” Investors are, however, worried that the strike could continue.The operator of Escondida said the company would not engage in talks with the miners, which are demanding higher bonuses and salaries after a rally in copper prices of 32.7 per cent since January 2010, until they stop the strike. The miners have requested a second-round of government-mediated negotiations.BHP Billiton is the largest owner of Escondida, controlling a 57.5 per cent stake, followed by Rio Tinto, with a 30 per cent stake. A consortium of Japanese trading houses, lead by Mitsubishi, and the International Finance Corporation, the private-sector lending arm of the World Bank, completes the shareholding.Although state-owned Codelco is the world’s largest copper producer and controls a large chunk of Chile’s mining sector, private-sector mining companies such as Rio Tinto, Xstrata, Anglo American and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold have large operations in the country. The South American nation is the world’s largest producer of the red metal, accounting for a third of global output.In late afternoon trading at the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three months was up 1.5 per cent on the day to $9,821 a tonne. The red metal earlier hit a session high of $9,850 a tonne, approaching its highest level in three months.Copper set an all-time high of $10,190 a tonne in February amid concerns of a shortage. But a slowdown in Chinese demand sent prices down to a low of $8,504 a tonne in mid May. Since then, struggling production and signs that China, the world’s largest buyer, is again buying the metal have propelled prices.
178;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-07-21T22:44:40Z;Freeport confident of copper boom;;Freeport McMoran, the world’s biggest publicly traded copper producer, has predicted strong markets that could push its cash flow as high as $9bn this year compared with $6.3bn in 2010.The financial strength of Freeport, which declared a special dividend last year to clear excess cash, reflected even higher demand for copper and gold this year than last.The US-based company would reverse last year’s trend of declining copper production, it said. It estimated copper output of 3.9bn pounds in 2011 compared with 3.14bn last year and 3.35bn in 2009, as it expands production at its North American mines.Xstrata, Rio Tinto, and Anglo American – three of the largest London-listed miners – will report half-year numbers over the next two weeks with earnings buoyed by copper sales to China.Richard Adkerson, Freeport’s chief executive, said destocking of copper inventories in China was helping to support the copper price.He noted China’s efforts to cool the economy but said: “There is a tremendous amount of spending on infrastructure and housing. China has the financial resources to continue to invest in the face of global economic conditions.”Freeport’s interim pre-tax profits of $5.5bn rose 77 per cent from $3.1bn in the six months to June 2010, while revenues rose from $8.2bn to $11.5bn.The company revealed the effect of an eight-day strike at Grasberg, a key mine on a mountaintop in Indonesia, that caused it to lose production totalling 35m pounds of copper and 60,000 ounces of gold.This year the company plans to produce 1.6m gold ounces, lower than last year’s production. The price of gold this week hit an all-time high above $1,600 per ounce.Mr Adkerson also warned of rising input costs and scarcity of materials needed to build and run mines.This is expected to be a theme in the mining sector this earnings season, as booming spending strains supplies of everything from equipment to labour.“In 2008 if you asked me what were the big issues we’re facing, I would say people availability and supplier availability,” he said. “Now that is going to be a huge issue going forward.”Freeport said it held $3.5bn in total debt and consolidated cash of $4.4bn.“We are spending capital as aggressively as we can,” Mr Adkerson told analysts, noting expansion projects across its global operations.The shares closed down 1.04 per cent at $55.34 in New York.
179;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-07-15T17:19:31Z;Kalimantan awaits permits for Borneo mine;;Shares in Kalimantan Gold slipped this week after the Indonesia-focused miner said it was awaiting forestry permits before it could proceed with its copper joint venture in Borneo.The Aim-traded gold and copper miner in April signed a joint venture with a subsidiary of US miner Freeport McMoran to drill at three sites to a depth of 1km.However, the forestry permits could take up to a month to be approved. Kalimantan said it had “submitted all the required documentation to apply for these permits, which are expected to be issued shortly”.The group has been operating in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo, since the mid-1990s. It came to Aim in 2007 after acquiring its Jelai gold prospect on the east of the island from Ivanhoe Mines.Shares in Kalimantan have risen by more than 40 per cent over the past 12 months, thanks to rising gold and copper prices.
180;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-07-07T21:10:11Z;Wall Street boosted by employment data;;Wall Street bounced higher after US employment data surpassed expectations and a number of retailers reported strong same-store sales, helping the markets to shake off the malaise of the last few days.Target, the discount retailer, was one of the best performing stock on the S&P 500, adding 6.7 per cent to $51.67 after reporting a 4.5 per cent rise in June same store sales, which was at the top end of its projected range.Elsewhere, Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, rose 2.7 per cent to $40.35 as same-store sales jumped 12 per cent last month, easily topping the 3.8 per cent expected by analysts.Hot Topic, the teen retailer, was up 13.2 per cent to $8.40 while Kohl’s added 7 per cent to $55.78 after also reporting healthy sales numbers.Urban Outfitters was up 6 per cent to $32.58, helped by a ratings upgrade.This raft of strong news left the S&P retail sector up 2.4 per cent, while the S&P consumer discretionary sector climbed 1.3 per cent, one of the best performing major indices in the session.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 index was up 1.1 per cent to 1,353.22, the first substantial rise in a mostly flat week, led by the financial, industrial, technology as well as the consumer discretionary sectors as strong employment data prompted a “risk on” trade on Wall Street.Sentiment was boosted by news that the Automatic Data Processing number on employment had come in better than expected. The survey found that 157,000 private jobs had been added to the US economy in June, which was ahead of the 95,000 that had been forecast by economists.This raised hopes that the crucial non-farm employment data on Friday, which is closely watched by the markets as an indicator of the strength of the US economy, would come in strong as well. Analysts upgraded their expectations for non-farm payrolls following the ADP figure.Separately, labor department figures showed that the number of people claiming for unemployment benefits slipped 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 418,000 last week, which was better than the 420,000 reading economists had expected.This healthy data added weight to the bullish argument that the last few months of weak economic data – which left the markets down 7.2 per cent from the start of May to the middle of June – was just a summer “slow patch” from which the US economy would recover.“The recent ISM data, the same store sales figures and the ADP report all bolsters the case that the soft patch was indeed just a temporary blip,” said Karyn Cavanaugh, market strategist with ING Investment Management.Hopes that the US economic recovery would begin to accelerate again helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.7 per cent to 12,719.57.The Nasdaq Composite added 1.4 per cent to 2,872.66, closing just a fraction away from a fresh decade-long high.Financial stocks were the best performing of the session as risk appetite improved and traders positioned themselves for a healthy official jobs report on Friday.JP Morgan Chase was one of the best performing financial stocks, adding 1.9 per cent to $41.32 as its private investment arm, One Equity Partners, agreed to buy APAC Customer Services, an outsourced services company, for $470m.Shares in APAC were up 55.2 per cent to $8.44.In other news, NYSE Euronext was up 3 per cent to $35.40 after its shareholders voted to approve the proposed tie up with Deutsche Börse, clearing the first of many hurdles in the merger process.The energy and materials sector were also up in the session as commodity prices ticked higher. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, was up 3.7 per cent to $55.49 while Halliburton added 3.1 per cent to $54.30.The S&P materials index was up 1.5 per cent while the energy index added 1.4 per cent.The technology sector also benefited from the “risk on“ trade, adding 1.1 per cent. The sector was led by KLA Tencor, a semiconductor equipment maker, which was up 7 per cent to $42.53, bouncing back to its 50-day moving average line.Utility, healthcare and telecommunication stocks were among the worst performing as investors rotated out of defensive sectors.Pfizer was down 2.7 per cent to $20.23, leading the losses in the healthcare sector, as the drugmaker said it was considering spinning off its animal health and nutritional unit to focus on the pharmaceutical business.The S&P utility sector was up 0.4 per cent, while the telecom and healthcare indices were flat.In other news, News Corp saw high volume trading after the media group closed one of its popular British newspapers amidst a furore over phone hacking, but the stock was only down 0.2 per cent to $17.43.
181;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-07-01T20:30:24Z;Wall Street rally gathers pace;Rising optimism over economy;Wall Street saw its sharpest weekly gains in two years after better than expected manufacturing data buoyed risk appetite, helping the major indices achieve their fifth consecutive session of gains.The benchmark S&P 500 index was up 1.4 per cent to 1,339.67, led by the consumer discretionary, financial and industrial sectors, after strong data raised hopes that the US economy was coming out of the recent slow patch.Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performing, led by Apollo Group, which jumped 6.4 per cent to $46.46 after the operator of for-profit schools reported stronger than expected third-quarter earnings.Elsewhere in the sector, Darden Restaurants was up 6.1 per cent to $52.78 while Wynn Resorts added 4.2 per cent to $149.57.But the gains were broad based, with all 10 major sectors moving forward after the reading for the ISM manufacturing index came in at 55.3 for June. This was ahead of the 53.5 in May and better than the 52 expected by economists. A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity.This number followed news on Thursday that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index had come in at 61.1, which was also well above economists’ expectations and raised hopes that the economy was improving after weeks in the doldrums.“This data are a strong sign we are coming out of the recent soft patch,” said Mark Lamkin, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist of Lamkin Wealth Management.This feeling on Wall Street lifted risky assets. The S&P financial and industrial sectors were up 1.7 per cent while the consumer discretionary sector added 2 per cent and technology stocks were up 1.7 per cent.Defensive sectors like consumer staples and telecoms were some of the worst performing, rising only 0.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.Gains in the industrial sector were led by Cummins which put on 3.8 per cent to $107.42 while the technology sector was dominated by gains from Visa and MasterCard.The credit card companies continued to be lifted by news on Wednesday that the US Federal Reserve set a higher than expected cap on debit card transaction fees. Visa was up 4.4 per cent to $87.97 while MasterCard added 4.4 per cent to $314.47.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average index up 1.4 per cent at 12,581.86 and the Nasdaq Composite 1.5 per cent higher at 2,816.03.The Dow and the Nasdaq were up 5.4 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively, over the week.The S&P 500 added 5.6 per cent over the five days, the best week on the index since July 2009. The Dow and the Nasdaq also saw their best week in two years.The only real downbeat news in the session was that the University of Michigan Consumer Confidence index came in at 71.5 for June, slightly short of the 72 reading expected and down from 74.3 in May, but the markets shrugged this off.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was down 4.8 per cent to 15.72, adding to the 21.7 per cent drop it had already seen this week as investors positioned themselves for a steady climb in the equity markets.The week on Wall Street kicked off in positive territory despite some lacklustre consumer spending data as the big indices bounced off key technical support levels reached the previous week after nearly two straight months of losses.The S&P 500 had fallen 7 per cent from the start of May, reaching a bottom at the end of last week. The index found its support level just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound that followed over the news five days was sharp, with the S&P index putting on around 1 per cent every session.The markets were helped by a partial resolution to the situation in Greece on Wednesday and then the stronger manufacturing data on Thursday and Friday. Investors were also positioning themselves for the upcoming earnings season – starting in earnest on July 11 – which is expected to be quite strong.In recent quarters markets have generally rallied before and during the earnings season as investors turn their attention away from macroeconomic concerns and on to companies news.This repositioning took form of a rotation into risk assets. The best performing sectors over the week were energy, which was up 7.2 per cent, technology, which added 6.8 per cent and consumer discretionary, which rose 6.6 per cent.One of the biggest pieces of corporate news from the session was the strong earnings results from Nike, which came as a relief to investors, who were concerned after the company missed expectations last quarter.Shares in Nike were up 13.1 per cent to $91.82.
182;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-06-29T20:47:11Z;Financials lead Wall Street higher;;Financial stocks saw some of the strongest gains in an upbeat session on Wall Street as the big indices continued to bounce off some technical lows last week and sentiment was lifted by news that the Greek parliament had passed a package of austerity measures.The financial sector, which has been one of the worst performing in recent months, falling 14 per cent from its last cyclical high in February, bounced up 2.1 per cent led by the large investment banks.Morgan Stanley was up 4.8 per cent to $23.39 while Goldman Sachs rose 2.6 per cent to $132.58. The S&P investment banking index was up 3.1 per cent.The S&P financial sector has now added 3.7 per cent in the past three days, and is on course for its best week in nearly seven months.Elsewhere in the sector, Visa was up 15 per cent to $86.58 while MasterCard added 11.3 per cent to $309.70 on news that the Federal Reserve is proposing to rework limits on fees that banks can charge each time a consumer uses a debit card.Bank of America added 3 per cent to $11.14 as investors reacted positively to news that the bank will pay $8.5bn to finally settle claims by investors that mortgage-backed securities sold by its Countrywide Financial unit failed to meet underwriting requirements and other guidelines.These gains helped the S&P 500 put on 0.8 per cent to 1,307.41, pulling the measure back over the psychologically significant 1,300 mark and reacquainting the benchmark index with its 150-day moving average lost three weeks ago.The materials sector saw the next strongest gains in the session after financials as the sector benefited from the uptick in global risk appetite after the Greek vote and some strong analysts’ reports on the steel industry.US Steel rose 5.9 per cent to $45.85 while AK Steel added 5.2 per cent to $15.51 after the companies received a ratings upgrade from Deutsche Bank. The sector also benefited from a Goldman Sachs note saying that steel demand in the third quarter may surprise to the upside.Elsewhere in the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner by market capitalisation, was up 2.3 per cent to $51.62 while Allegheny Technologies rose 4.3 per cent to $64.29.Monsanto, the largest seed company by revenue, which is also a member of the S&P materials index, was up 5 per cent to $70.26 after reporting a 77 per cent jump in earnings on higher sales of Roundup weed killer and genetically modified crop seeds.The energy sector saw the next strongest gains. The S&P energy index was up 1.1 per cent as Halliburton, the oilfield services company, added 2.3 per cent to $49.82 and Schlumberger rose 1 per cent to $85.22.All these gains left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.6 per cent to 12,262.78, moving to within striking distance of its 100-day moving average line, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 2,740.49.The 3.1 per cent gains on the S&P 500 index so far this week, following nearly two straight months of losses, have led some investors to argue that the market reached a bottom last week when the index neared its technically significant 200-day moving average line.Sentiment on Wednesday was helped by better-than-expected housing data. Figures showed that pending sales of previously owned US homes rose 8.2 per cent in May ahead of the 3 per cent rise expected.This follows news in the previous session that April saw a rare monthly rise in home prices on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, suggesting that the pace of decline in the beleaguered housing market may be abating somewhat.But most argued that there was still little reason to be bullish on the downtrodden sector, particularly as the gains in pending sales last month followed a 11.3 per cent drop in pending sales in April.“In absolute terms this is a very depressed level, and with prices in most areas either still declining or flat, there is little incentive for buyers to be aggressive,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Shares in KB Home fell 15.4 per cent to $10.08 in the session after the homebuilder reported a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss, in a further confirmation that the sector was far from healthy.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in BJ’s Wholesale Club were up 4.6 per cent to $50.29 after the discount retailer announced that it was selling itself to the private equity firms Leonard Green & Partners and CVC Capital Partners for $2.8bn, wrapping up a months-long sale process.

to $77.93.These gains helped the S&P 500 index put on 1.3 per cent to 1,296.67 in a low volume session, adding to the 0.9 per cent rise on Monday.The 2.2 per cent bounce in the S&P so far this week comes after nearly two straight months of losses on the index, prompting some commentators to argue that US equities may have found their bottom.“The markets may retest the lows of last week, but I think we have reached a bottom and the worst of the declines are over,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The “risk-on” trade dominated in the session, leading the materials, energy and technology sectors sharply higher along with the consumer discretionaries.The technology sector was helped by a number of ratings upgrades, leaving the sector up 1.3 per cent.LinkedIn, the business focused social networking site, was up 11.2 per cent to $84.91 after a raft of banks put “buy” and “outperform” ratings on the stock as they began coverage following its initial public offering last month.Monster Worldwide added 9.9 per cent to $14.91, also lifted by a number of positive analysts reports.Elsewhere in the tech sector, Microsoft put on 2.4 per cent $25.80, adding to the 3.7 per cent gained in the previous session, as the company unveiled an online version of its Office software suite.The S&P energy sector was the best performing on Wall Street, rising 2.7 per cent as Schlumberger was up 4.6 per cent to $84.32 while Halliburton put on 5.3 per cent to $48.70.Among the materials stocks to gain were Freeport-McMoRan, which added 3.6 per cent to $50.45 and Cliff Natural Resources, which climbed 2.1 per cent to $89.21. The S&P materials index was up 1.8 per cent, benefiting from a rise in commodity prices.These gains helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 1.2 per cent to 12,188.69 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite add 1.5 per cent to 2,729.31.Overall sentiment was also helped by hopes that the Greek parliament would vote to approve some key austerity measures on Wednesday.Economic data from the session was mixed. The Case-Shiller index recorded a rare monthly rise in home prices in April on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, suggesting that the pace of decline in house prices may have abated somewhat.But the index was down 4 per cent from the previous year and it was not clear how much of the gain was due to recent higher temperatures. “It is much too early to tell if this is a turning point or simply due to some warmer weather,” said the report from Case-Shiller.Still, the S&P homebuilding index up 1.2 per cent in the session and Pulte group , the largest US housebuilder by sales, added 2.7 per cent to $7.89.In other economic news, data from the conference board found that US consumer confidence had fallen in June to its lowest since November 2010.The Vix volatility index, which is also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 5.4 per cent to 19.45 in the session, as traders turned more optimistic.In corporate news, Accenture gained 3.2 per cent to $59.66 after Standard & Poor’s said the consulting company would replace Marshall & Ilsley in the S&P 500 index next month when the regional bank’s takeover by Bank of Montreal is expected to close."

The S&P financial index added 1.1 per cent while the KBW banking index climbed 1.4 per cent.The sector was helped by news that banking capital requirements agreed over the weekend were less punitive than some had feared.These gains helped the S&P 500 up 0.9 per cent to 1,280.09, with the index finding support just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses, and traders are using the 200-day average as an excuse to get back in,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound on Wall Street was broad based, with all 10 big S&P indices gaining ground.But technology stocks saw the strongest gains, rebounding from the 1.8 per cent losses in the previous session.The S&P technology index, which had suffered a 10.7 per cent correction since its last cyclical high in February, was up 1.4 per cent.Microsoft was one of the best performing stocks in the sector, rising 3.7 per cent to $25.20 in the biggest one-day move upwards in more than nine months. On Tuesday, the technology group is launching a new cloud version of Microsoft Office.Elsewhere, Amazon was up 4.5 per cent to $201.25 while Adobe Systems added 3.1 per cent to $30.89.The material sector was the worst performing in the session as commodity prices softened. Allegheny Technologies fell 1.5 per cent to $59.11 and the S&P material index was up 0.2 per cent.Sentiment in the session was not helped by weak data on consumer spending, but these technical factors meant the news was largely shrugged off by the markets. Still, data from the commerce department showed that consumer spending had remained largely unchanged in May, which was the first time in nearly a year that spending had not gone up. The figure was also below the 0.1 per cent rise that had been expected by economists.The data are just one in a long line of weak economic numbers released in the past few months which have left the S&P 500 6.1 per cent lower since the start of May.“With the economic indicators weakening and the concerns about the European periphery rising, markets are once again questioning the strength of the economic recovery,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs.Even so, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent to 12,043.56 in the session, reclaiming its 150-day moving average lost last week.The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3 per cent to 2,688.28, bouncing off its own 200-day moving average level hit on Friday.The Nasdaq and the Dow indices are on their way towards 5.2 per cent and 4.2 per cent losses this month, respectively. The S&P 500 is looking at a 4.8 per cent fall in the worst month on the index since June 2010.In corporate news, ReneSola lost ground after announcing that its chief financial officer was resigning.

First Solaris down 16.4 per cent to $116.68 since the start of May. But LDK Solar jumped 4.9 per cent to $7.14 in the session after the Chinese solar company said it planned to buy back up to $100m of its American Depository Shares.Wall Street kicked off the week in positive territory despite some lacklustre consumer spending data as the major indices bounced off key technical support levels after nearly two straight months of losses.The financial sector, which has been one of the worst performing in recent months falling 13 per cent from its last cyclical high in February, saw the strongest gains in the session.Janus Capital was up 2.3 per cent to $8.99 while Bank of America rose 2.3 per cent to $10.76. The S&P financial index added 0.9 per cent while the KBW banking index climbed 1.3 per cent.These gains helped the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent to 1,275.69, with the index finding support just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses, and traders are using the 200-day average as an excuse to get back in,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound on Wall Street was broad based, with nine out of ten major S&P indices gaining ground in the session.After financials, technology stocks saw the next strongest gains. The S&P technology index, which has suffered a 10.7 per cent correction since its last cyclical high in February, was up 0.9 per cent.Microsoft was one of the best performing stocks in the sector, rising 3.5 per cent to $25.15 in the biggest one-day move upwards in over nine months. On Tuesday, the technology giant is launching a new cloud version of Microsoft Office.Only the material sector was lower in the session as commodity prices softened. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, lost 0.6 per cent to $48.14 while Cliff Natural Resources fell 0.8 per cent to $85.90.Sentiment in the session was not helped by weak data on consumer spending, but these technical factors meant that the news was largely shrugged off by the markets.Still, data from the commerce department showed that consumer spending had remained largely unchanged in May, which was the first time in nearly a year that spending had not gone up.

185;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-06-23T20:50:49Z;Energy and financials lead losses on Wall St;;"Energy and financial stocks led the losses in a volatile session on Wall Street as traders continued to digest the downbeat assessment of the US economy given by the Federal Reserve late in the previous session and also worried about a disappointing rise in unemployment claims.The markets tumbled in early trading on these worries, but then managed to rally somewhat towards the end of the session on news reports that European leaders had reached a breakthrough on a Greek austerity plan.Still, the financial sector still saw the sharpest losses in the session, falling 1 per cent as Fifth Third Bancorp fell 2.5 per cent to $12.09 and Bank of New York Mellondeclined 2.3 per cent to $25.44. The KBW banking index was down 1 per cent.Industrial stocks also suffered from a “risk off” trade. Boeing was down 1.2 per cent to $71.25 as the S&P industrial index fell 0.3 per cent.But the worst losses came from the energy sector as oil prices fell hard after an unexpected intervention in the oil markets by the International Energy Agency.The S&P energy index was down 1.1 per cent as Schlumberger fell 0.6 per cent to $83.10 and Chevron lost 1.7 per cent to $99.36.The sell-off in risk assets began late on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lowered its growth forecast for the US economy and lifted its inflation expectations.The downbeat mood persisted into Thursday’s session, and the S&P 500 was down 1.5 per cent by mid-session.But the markets reversed some of their losses in late trading following a Reuters report that Greece had forged a deal with the EU and IMF on a five-year austerity plan.The S&P 500 then closed only 0.3 per cent lower at 1,283.50.Helping keep the index in negative territory, however, was data from the labour department showing that the number of unemployed Americans filing for jobless benefits rose 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 429,000 last week, which was more than had been expected by economists.Separate data from the commerce department showed that new home sales fell 2.1 per cent in May, though the news was not all bad as the median home sale price rose 2.6 per cent from April.Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.5 per cent to 12,053.93. The Nasdaq Composite ended the session up 0.7 per cent to 2,686.82.The Vix volatility index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, rose 7.5 per cent to 29.77.Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management, argued that the losses in the session were due to a downturn in sentiment rather than any change in the fundamentals, as the economic data were mixed and the Federal Reserve did not say anything that had not been anticipated.The financial sector actually saw some strong gains in the session, led by Western Digitalwhich jumped 7.1 per cent to $37.01 after a favourable analyst report. Elsewhere, Red Hat gained 3.6 per cent to $45.27 after the software company reported better-than-
expected first-quarter earnings and raised its forecast for the year.Micron Technology was up 3.1 per cent to $8.43 while Nvidiaadded 3 per cent to $16.21. The S&P technology sector was up 0.9 per cent.The healthcare sector saw almost no losses in the session, helped by gains from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer after the companies said their blood thinner Apixaban (Eliquis) had seen some positive trial results. Bristol-Myers was up 5.7 per cent to $29.33 while Pfizer added 1.8 per cent to $20.65.In other news, Rite Aid, the drugstore chain, was up 5.5 per cent to $1.16 after reporting a smaller-than-
expected first-quarter loss driven by a decline in expenses and stronger same-store sales growth.Lennar, the homebuilder, also reported a loss that was better than analysts had expected. Its stock was up 2.3 per cent to $18.51, but it was still 1.8 per cent lower over the year.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, rose 5.3 per cent to $56.93 after its first-quarter earnings beat earnings targets and the company raised its outlook for profit growth this yearConAgra, the maker of Healthy Choice frozen meals, was down 0.2 per cent to $25.37 after its earnings fell short of expectations and investors worried about the effect of higher commodity costs."
186;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-05-27T20:47:17Z;Commodity prices buoy Wall Street;;Upbeat guidance from Marvell Technology Group lifted the technology sector, while in the wider markets positive data on consumer sentiment and some firmer commodity prices helped Wall Street to pare nearly all of the losses suffered during another lacklustre week.The maker of chips for personal computers and mobile phones released disappointing first-quarter results, reporting a 29 per cent drop in earnings, but the strong forecast encouraged investors and the stock was up 11.1 per cent to $16.17.This helped lift related equities and Broadcom, another chipmaker, was up 5.4 per cent to $36.52, one of the best performing stocks on the S&P 500. Broadcom was also helped by news that FBR Capital Markets had added the stock to its “top picks” list.Cree, which makes LED and semiconductor materials, gained 4.9 per cent to $43.61 while the Philadelphia semiconductor index put on 1.1 per cent.The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,331.11, with the index helped by gains for material stocks as commodity prices were broadly higher.But these gains were not enough to save the measure from falling 0.2 per cent overall over the five day period, the fourth straight week of losses on the index.This was the first time since June 2008 that the index went an entire month with no up weeksThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 0.3 per cent on Friday to 12,441.481, was still down 0.6 per cent over the week.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent to 2,796.86 in the session, down 0.2 per cent over the five days.On Friday, the materials sector saw the sharpest gains. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner by market capitalisation, added 2.7 per cent to $51.73 and Peabody Energy rose 1.6 per cent to $62.62. The S&P materials index added 1 per cent, up 2.1 per cent in the past five days.In the energy sector, Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, was down 0.3 cent to $84.72 as the oil price turned into negative territory in late trading.The S&P energy sector still added 0.2 per cent in the session, however, up 2 per cent over the week.The broad-based gains on Friday came as investors shrugged off terrible housing data and mixed consumer spending data, choosing to focus on the upturn in consumer confidence. Pending home sales plunged 11.6 per cent in April, which was much worse than the 0.9 per cent fall that economists had been expecting.Separate data said that personal consumption expenditure was up 0.4 per cent in April, below the 0.5 per cent that had been forecast by economists.But the Michigan index of consumer sentiment showed that consumers were more optimistic in May than they had been for three months.The consumer sentiment data was a relief to investors, as it went against the recent trend of weak economic news. The raft of disappointing news this month has helped bring about the four straight weeks of losses on the S&P 500.For example, in the previous session, the commerce department said that consumption growth in the first quarter was weaker than it previously thought and it also dashed hopes that national gross domestic product for the first quarter would be revised upwards from 1.8 per cent.“We are in a downward trend and most likely it will continue,” said Scott O’Neil, president of MarketSmith and portfolio manager with O’Neil Data Systems, reflecting the downbeat tone that is in fashion across much of Wall Street.“The best place to be right now is cash,” he said.The week on Wall Street began with sharp losses on Monday as slack global growth figures created fresh doubts over earnings estimates for the next quarter and added to the general sense of malaise.The S&P 500 has fallen 2.2 per cent this month.The losses on Monday left the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq below their 50-day moving averages. In the later half of the week the indices sought to reclaim these technical levels and the markets saw modest gains.One of the most widely-discussed events of the week was the initial public offering of Yandex, the Russian search engine, as it ties into a broader excitement about technology IPOs.On the first day of trading, the Russian group did not disappoint, and was up as much as 144 per cent. The stock settled at a more modest 55.4 per cent gain from its IPO price.But the stock has lost 11.3 per cent this week to $34.45 after its first day of trading.
187;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

The S&P materials index gained 1.4 per cent.This helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 0.3 per cent to 12,394.66 while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,761.38.Technical factors also helped the wider markets to post gains, after the previous session saw the S&P 500 hit a one-month low and come near a resistance level of 1,315.Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “The S&P 500 continues to trend toward a potential test of the 1,295-1,300 zone with resistance emerging in the 1,315-1,320 area.”Gains on the indices were limited by downbeat economic data, however, with news that US demand for durable goods had sunk more than expected in April.The number of new orders for durable goods fell 3.6 per cent last month, led by a sharp drop in car and aircraft orders.Car orders dropped 4.5 per cent, the sharpest fall since August, as parts shortages following the Japanese earthquake slowed production at US factories.Ford shares fell 0.6 per cent to $14.58 in the session, leading the S&P auto index down 0.5 per cent.Shares in AIG were down 4 per cent to $28.28 after 300m shares in the bailed-out insurer began trading after a secondary offering.The US Treasury sold 200m shares worth $5.8bn while AIG itself sold 100m shares worth $2.9bn.Applied Materials reported forecast-beating second-quarter earnings but rose only 1.1 per cent to $13.86 as the manufacturer of chipmaking equipment forecast an unexpected drop in current-quarter revenue.Applied Materials has fallen 11.7 per cent this month, one of the many technology stocks that have been on a downward trend recently as investors have moved away from riskier assets into more defensive sectors.The S&P technology index has fallen 4.3 per cent this month while Apple has lost 3.8 per cent to $336.78.Citigroup analysts said that, after the recent losses, it was hard to see a lot of downside on Applied Materials shares, although they argued that now was still not quite the right time to buy.Away from the technology sector, shares in Toll Brothers rose 1.8 per cent to $20.63 after the luxury homebuilder reported a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss as sales and margins improved.Hormel Foods, which makes Spam and MegaMex Foods products, fell 4.8 per cent to $28.59 after the company forecast a fall in margins because of rising input prices.Express dropped 12 per cent to $20.12 after the apparel retailer said that its second-quarter earnings would not exceed 15 cents a share, which was below the 16 cents a share that analysts had been expecting.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, fell 5.4 per cent to 16.86 in the session.
189;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-05-24T21:32:45Z;US financials lose ground;;Shares in AutoZone jumped after the company reported better than expected quarterly earnings, but the wider markets were broadly flat as investors remained wary following the sharp sell-off in the previous session.Shares in the motor parts retailer were up 6 per cent to $293.30 after reporting a 12 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings as sales and margins improved.Analysts had worried that high petrol prices might hurt sales as consumers are driving less and therefore need to replace parts less frequently.Earlier in the month, Advance Auto Parts, a smaller rival to AutoZone, disappointed investors with its quarterly results. Auto Parts is down 5 per cent this month at $62.54.The S&P 500 index closed broadly flat, edging less than 0.1 per cent lower to 1,316.28.Most sectors were slightly lower – following the 1.2 per cent sell-off in the previous session – as sentiment continued to be downbeat over the eurozone debt crisis and global growth concerns.Financial stocks continued to lose ground. Shares in Capital Onewere down 2 per cent to $53.03 while the Bank of New York Mellonfell 1.2 per cent to $27.49. The S&P financial index lost 0.5 per cent.Healthcare stocks were also lower. United Health Group lost 2.4 per cent to $47.96 while Humana fell 1.6 per cent to $78.The S&P healthcare sector was down 0.3 per cent, although it is still up 7.3 per cent since the start of the second quarter as investors have recently been moving from cyclical stocks into more defensive areas.Sentiment across the markets was helped slightly by better than expected housing data. The number of new home sales rose 7.3 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 323,000, ahead of the 300,000 expected.But this was still weak and so did not cheer investors too much.“The outcome was better than generally expected, although still miserable in absolute terms,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The losses in the wider markets were limited primarily by the rebound in energy and material stocks.In the energy sector, a bounce in the oil price helped Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, climb 1.5 per cent to $83.28 while Halliburton rose 2.9 per cent to $47.50.The S&P energy index was up 1.3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 3 per cent to $48.82 while Consol Energy, the coal miner, added 1.3 per cent to $48.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,356.36 in cautious trading. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,746.16.These larger indices have lost ground for the past three weeks as weak economic data have sparked concerns that interest rate rises globally are beginning to slow economic growth.“This has aggravated suspicions that the US economy may have entered a soft patch, not unlike in the spring of last year,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.Last year the S&P fell 11.7 per cent from the start of April to the end of August on concerns over a double-dip recession.In corporate news, shares in Yandex, the Russian search engine, rocketed on its first day of trading.The Russian group was up as much at 144 per cent in early trading, although it settled at a more modest 55.4 per cent gain from its initial public offering price at $35.20. Yandex was priced on Monday night at $25 a share, valuing the company at $8bn.The jump in price was small compared with LinkedIn last Thursday, when shares in the business-focused social networking site jumped 109.4 per cent to $94.25 on their first day of trading.LinkedIn was up 8.1 per cent to $95.45 on Tuesday, in spite of restrictions having been lifted on short selling the stock, which pared all of the losses seen since the first day of trading on Thursday.Elsewhere, shares in El Paso Corp were up 6.5 per cent to $20.22, the best performing stock on the S&P 500, after the natural gas group announced it intended to separate its exploration and production unit from its pipeline and midstream businesses.Medtronicwas down 0.9 per cent to $40.88 after the medical devices company reported fourth-quarter earnings down 19 per cent on restructuring and other charges. Revenues were up slightly and better than expected, however.
190;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-05-23T20:59:00Z;US stocks fall on global growth worries;;Campbell Soup lost ground after reporting disappointing sales while the largest US indices tumbled below their 50-day moving averages as slack global growth figures created fresh doubts over earnings estimates for the next quarter.The world’s largest soup maker reported a better than expected quarterly profit and said it expected full-year results at the high end of its forecast.But US soup sales were down 7 per cent and margins declined, prompting its shares to fall 0.8 per cent to $34.95. In the previous quarter, US soup sales had fallen by 4 per cent.The S&P 500 was down 1.2 per cent to 1,317.37, led lower by those sectors most exposed to the global economy as weak economic data out of China and Europe prompted fears of a slowdown.“The economic data from China and Europe are causing people to question their earnings estimates for the next two quarters,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global. Although losses on Wall Street were broad-based, the industrial, energy and technology sectors were the worst-performing.Around 30 per cent of all sales in S&P 500 companies come from overseas but the technology, material and energy sectors have the greatest exposure to activity outside the US.In the industrial space, Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, fell 2.3 per cent to $101.89 while Cummins, the designer and manufacturer of power generation equipment, fell 2.1 per cent to $104.16.The S&P industrial index lost 1.4 per cent.The S&P energy index fell 1.5 per cent as oil prices slumped. Schlumberger, the oil services group, lost 1.7 per cent to $82.09.Losses in the technology sector were led by Red Hat, the software company, which slid 3.7 per cent to $44.03 while JDS Uniphase fell 3.6 per cent to $19.59.The technology sector garners 53 per cent of its sales from overseas, according to figures compiled by Citigroup.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was down 2 per cent to $47.42, leading the S&P materials index lower by 1 per cent.Telecommunications and utility stocks have the least international exposure and so suffered the slimmest losses in the session.The S&P telecoms sector was down only 0.7 per cent while the S&P utilities sector lost 1.2 per cent.Financial stocks saw losses, in spite of also having relatively low international exposure as worries over the sovereign debt crisis in Europe continued to mount.Citigroup was down 2.1 per cent to $40.16 while Suntrust Bankfell 2.5 per cent to $27.20.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.1 per cent lower at 12,380.88 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 2,758.90.The Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices all fell below their 50-day moving averages in the session, a signal of further selling to come.The benchmark S&P index has been hit by weekly falls for the last three weeks as some traders have worried that interest rate rises in emerging markets are finally starting to slow global growth, while others look nervously towards the imminent end of quantitative easing.Krispy Kreme was up 25.8 per cent to $8.05 after the doughnut chain reported that its net profit in the first quarter had more than doubled – it was the highest quarterly profit in more than seven years for the group.LinkedIn, the business- focused social networking site, failed to maintain the lofty price that it achieved on its first day of trading last week and fell 5.2 per cent to $88.30.The company priced on Wednesday night at $45 a share, already above the projected range, but the stock soared 109.4 per cent to $94.25 on Thursday.The stock is now down 6.3 per cent since then. On Tuesday, restrictions on short selling the stock will be lifted, which could precipitate a further drop.Shares in Apple were down 0.2 per cent to $334.40 following 1.6 per cent losses in the previous session as traders continued to watch the impact of an explosion at one of its main supplier’s factories late on Friday.Foxconn, a subsidiary of Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision, operated a plant that was set to produce most of Apple’s iPad 2, its second-generation tablet computer.The Vix volatility index was up 2.6 per cent to 17.88.
191;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-05-18T20:48:33Z;Energy and materials lift Wall Street;;Strong earnings from Dell buoyed related technology stocks and helped lift sentiment on Wall Street, pulling the wider markets into positive territory for the first time in three sessions.Dell was up 5.4 per cent to $16.75, making the stock one of the best performing on the S&P 500, after the company reported a 177 per cent rise in first-quarter profits.The better than expected jump in earnings came thanks to growth in sales to large businesses, which outweighed the weakness in sales to retail customers.Dell raised its earnings and revenue outlook for the year, in contrast to Hewlett-Packard, which lowered its forecast in the previous session as the weakness in consumer markets ate away at earnings.Shares in HP were down 9.7 per cent this week after falling another 1.1 per cent on Wednesday to $36.49.The results from Dell boosted related stocks in the computer hardware sector. NetApp, a provider of data storage, was up 2.5 per cent to $53.61, while Western Digital added 1.4 per cent to $36.82.Apple, the second most valuable company in the world by market capitalisation, gained 1.1 per cent to $339.87.The S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent to 1,340.68, its best day of trading in nearly a month. The index was helped higher by energy and materials stocks, which benefited from a rise in commodity prices.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, gained 3.8 per cent to $48.62, helping the S&P materials index up 2.1 per cent. Marathon Oil, the energy group, added 3 per cent to $51.53 as the wider S&P energy index put on 2 per cent.The gains helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 0.7 per cent to 12,560.18 and the Nasdaq Composite put on 1.1 per cent to 2,815.The markets saw little reaction to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting in April which yielded no major surprises.The markets have been in a correctional phase since the beginning of the month, with the S&P 500 falling 1.7 per cent in the past few weeks. Sentiment has been weighed down by commodity price swings, European debt woes and worries about the end of QE2.The concerns have led to a classic “risk off” trade, with investors rotating away from cyclical stocks and into more defensive sectors.The S&P healthcare and utility sectors are up 3.2 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively this month while the energy and materials sectors are down 7.4 per cent and 5 per cent.The utility sector saw the day’s worst losses as the broader markets ticked up, prompting commentators to suggest this defensive rotation was coming to an end.“The defensive names have been overbought in the past few weeks and the riskier names have been oversold,” said Quincy Krosby, strategist for Prudential Financial.The retail sector was in focus after mixed results.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen fashion retailer, were up 3.4 per cent to $75.69 after the company reported a bigger than expected swing in first-quarter profits as margins and international sales improved.The stock is up more than 30 per cent so far this year.Target, the discount retailer, reported a 2.7 per cent rise in first-quarter profit thanks to better than expected results in its credit card businessBut the stock was 1.6 per cent lower to $49.96 as investors worried about the softer sales at its stores.Shares in Staples were hit by a strong reaction to the office-supply company’s first-quarter earnings.The stock was down 15.4 per cent to $16.63 after the company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results and lowered its full-year earnings forecast by 15 cents a share to $1.35-$1.45.Staples posted a profit of 28 cents a share or $198.2m, short of the 32 cents expected.The S&P retail sector was down 0.3 per cent.Shares in Analog Devices were up 5.9 per cent to $42.60 after the chipmaker reported a 45 per cent jump in second-quarter earnings and lifted its forecasts for the current quarter above expectations. The company raised its dividend.John Deere, the top manufacturer of farm equipment by revenue, reported healthy earnings and raised its full-year outlook due to growing demand for tractors from farmers benefiting from the commodity boom. But investors were hoping for more, and the stock was down 0.5 per cent to $86.50.
192;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-05-17T21:14:09Z;Wall Street slips on poor US housing data;;Hewlett-Packard fell sharply after the technology group lowered its full-year earnings forecasts, while the wider markets fell for the third consecutive session after disappointing housing and industrial production data.Shares in the largest maker of personal computers by sales fell 7.3 per cent to $36.91, the worst performing stock on the S&P 500, after the group scaled back its revenue and profit forecasts for 2011.The company blamed the Japanese earthquake, slow sales of personal computers and reduced profit in its services business for the lower outlook.The stock was not helped by a degree of confusion surrounding the results. HP reported a day earlier than planned after a leaked memo from Léo Apotheker, its new chief executive, in which he warned that the company was facing “another tough quarter”.The disappointing results affected related technology stocks. NetApp, a provider of data storage, was down 1.5 per cent to $52.28 while SanDisk lost 3.4 per cent to $46.34.The S&P technology index was down 0.2 per cent.The S&P 500 closed down fractionally lower to 1,328.98 as sentiment was weighed down by data showing a sharp drop in US house construction.The number of houses built in April fell 10.6 per cent from the previous month, according to the US Department of Commerce, as oversupply sapped demand for new buildings.New building permits, a gauge of future construction, dropped 4 per cent in an indication that the sector will remain a drag on the economic recovery.This news weighed on homebuilding stocks. DR Horton, one of the largest US housebuilders, was down 1.7 per cent to $11.47 while Lennar lost 0.5 per cent to $17.50. The S&P homebuilding index declined 0.8 per cent.Data from the Federal Reserve showed an unexpected drop in manufacturing output last month. The 0.4 per cent fall was the first in 10 months and was led by an 8.9 per cent drop in autos.Industrial output remained static in the month, which was worse than the slight increase economists had been expecting. The news weakened stocks across the industrial sector. Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, was down 3.1 per cent to $102.81 while Joy Global fell 2.5 per cent to $86.19. The S&P industrial index was down 1.3 per cent, the worst performing sector on Wall Street.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.6 per cent to 12,479.58 and the Nasdaq Composite flat at 2,783.21.The broader markets have been in decline since the start of May as sentiment has been weighed down by sharp commodity price swings, European sovereign debt woes and worries about the end of quantitative easing.“The path of least resistance may be to the downside near term,” said analysts at Citigroup. “With traditional summer seasonality and some significant uncertainties … it does not appear likely that equity markets can bounce higher this summer.”The retail sector was in focus after mixed results from Walmart and Home Depot.Walmart was down 0.9 per cent to $55.54 after the world’s biggest retailer reported that sales in US stores that had been open more than a year had dropped for the eighth consecutive quarter. Net income rose 3.1 per cent to $3.6bn in the quarter, which served to limit the losses on the stock.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, was up 1.1 per cent to $37.40 after it raised its earnings outlook for the year and reported a strong gain in first-quarter income.Energy and material stocks lost ground as commodity prices softened.Materials was one of the worst performing sectors.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, fell 2.8 per cent to $16.45 and Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, lost 1.1 per cent to $46.83. The S&P materials index was 1.1 per cent lower.In the energy sector, Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, declined 0.2 per cent to $82.06. Cameron lost 2.3 per cent to $47.77. The S&P energy index was down 0.2 per cent.The financial sector was one of the few to gain in the session, led by Wells Fargo, which put on 3.2 per cent to $28.75.The S&P financial index added 0.7 per cent.
193;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-05-12T21:05:14Z;Upbeat jobs figures lift Wall Street;;Cisco Systems lost ground after issuing a profit warning, while the wider markets edged higher after broadly positive economic data and firmer commodity prices helped to lift investor sentiment.Shares in Cisco fell 4.8 per cent to $16.93 after the world’s largest producer of networking gear by revenues announced that its sales and profits in the current quarter would come in below expectations.The company also reported that its net income had fallen 18 per cent in its last quarter to $1.8bn, or 42 cents a share. This was broadly in line with expectations.News of the profit warning weighed on related technology stocks. Motorola Mobility fell 1.1 per cent to $24.98 while Harrislost 1.4 per cent to $48.29. The S&P technology equipment sector was down 0.7 per cent, although in the broader tech sector most stocks were up.Looking at the wider markets, the S&P 500 index closed up 0.5 per cent to 1,348.65, paring some of the 1.1 per cent losses in the previous session, with sentiment helped by upbeat employment data.Figures from the Labor Department showed that 44,000 fewer Americans applied for unemployment insurance last week.The number of new claims fell to 434,000, which was a bigger drop than had been expected and was the steepest fall since February 2010.It also reversed much of the sharp increase in claims in the previous week. But other data in the session were less positive, showing that the higher oil and food costs were hitting retail spending and lifting producer prices.The 0.5 per cent rise in retail sales in April and the 0.8 per cent rise in inflation were both slightly worse than the markets had been expecting.Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,696.14 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.6 per cent to 2,863.04.The energy sectors were again lower in the session, as traders remained uneasy following the recent volatility in the oil markets.Within the energy sector Murphy Oil fell 1.3 per cent to $66.63 while ConocoPhillips declined 1.4 per cent to $71.53. The broader S&P energy sector closed down only 0.1 per cent, however, after the oil priced edged a little higher. The S&P energy sector has fallen 7.2 per cent this month.Consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks saw some of the biggest gains in a possible sign that some stocks are beginning to benefit from the recent drop in oil prices.Among the stocks to gain in these sectors, Tyson Foods was up 4.6 per cent to $18.84 while Mead Johnson added 2.1 per cent to $67.72. Best Buy rose 4.1 per cent to $31.69.The S&P consumer discretionary index was up 0.9 per cent and the consumer stable index added 1.3 per cent.The financial sector was one of the worst performing of the session, led by Goldman Sachs. Shares in the investment bank were down 3.5 per cent to $142.1 after pair of analyst notes downgraded the stock, warning investors that Goldman could still face charges from the US Justice Department for its behaviour during the financial crisis.Citigroup fell 1.2 per cent to $42.42, adding to the 5 per cent losses already this week after putting into effect a one-for-10 reverse stock split on Monday. The move reduced the number of outstanding shares of Citigroup’s common stock from about 29bn to 2.9bn.The S&P financial index was down 0.1, recovering from sharper losses earlier in the session as the afternoon continued.Elsewhere, shares in First Solar rose 6.3 per cent to $132.07, the best performing stock on the S&P 500 index, after the maker of thin-film solar modules received letters indicating support from the US Energy Department for three projects in California.Shares in Symantec added 5.2 per cent to $20.42 after the maker of security software reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 38 cents a share, exceeding the average analyst estimate by 2 cents.VeriSign, the company best known for the management of internet domain names, was up 3.2 per cent to $36.68 after saying that it had resolved a lawsuit.Clearwire, a wireless broadband provider, fell 15.6 per cent to $3.99 after Intel said that it would sell 10m shares in the company.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in Kohl’s added 3.9 per cent to $55.68 after the retailer reported a 6 per cent rise in first-quarter profit and raised its earnings forecast for the year.
194;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-05-11T22:09:38Z;Trade deficit and commodities dent Wall St;;Weak earnings results from Walt Disney weighed on the media sector, while disappointing trade data and softer commodity prices left the wider markets sharply lower.Shares in Walt Disney fell 5.4 per cent to $41.52, making the stock one of the worst performing on the S&P 500 index, after the company reported an unexpected drop in profits for its second quarter.Walt Disney reported earnings of 49 cents a share, short of the 58 cents a share expected, as profits were hit by box-office let-downs and the temporary closure of its Tokyo theme park after the earthquake in Japan.The results weighed on related media stocks, with CBS falling 2.3 per cent to $26.89 and Discovery Communications losing 1.9 per cent to $43.88. The S&P 500 media index was 2 per cent lower.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 closed down 1.1 per cent to 1,342.08, the worst one-day drop in the index in nearly two months. Investor sentiment was adversely affected by news that the US trade deficit had soared 6 per cent to $48.2bn in March as higher energy costs countered a promising jump in exports.This worsening of the trade deficit represented a “drag on real economic growth”, said analysts at Capital Economics.But it was the energy and material sectors which saw the steepest losses in the session, reacting to the latest fall in commodity prices.The sharp drop in oil prices left the S&P energy sector with the worst losses, down 3 per cent. This added to the 5 per cent losses already seen this month.Among the stocks to lose ground in the energy sector was Murphy Oil, which fell 3.6 per cent to $67.50, and ExxonMobil, which lost 2.1 per cent to $81.12.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, tumbled 5.6 per cent to $48.27, helping to drag the S&P materials index down 2.7 per cent.These losses contributed to a decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 1 per cent, to 12,630.11, with the index also suffering because Disney is one of its 30 components. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.9 per cent lower, falling to 2,845.06.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners in New York, argued that there were technical factors contributing to the losses on Wednesday, as the S&P 500 index had moved to within 0.5 per cent of its 2½-year high in the previous session.“The market has run into some technical difficulties, but I am confident that it will overcome them and test the 1,400 level in the next few weeks,” said Mr Cardillo.Shares in Macy’s soared 7.7 per cent to $28.36, making it the best performer among the S&P 500, after the retailer reported bumper profits that far surpassed analysts’ expectations.Macy’s reported earnings of 30 cents a share, up from 5 cents a share a year earlier and way ahead of the 18 cents a share expected by analysts. Sales were up and the retailer also doubled its quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share.American International Group rallied 3.5 per cent to $30.65 after the beleaguered insurance company and the US Treasury outlined plans for a scaled-back share offering in the company.AIG said on Wednesday that it would sell 100m shares and that the Treasury would sell 200m shares, raising some $9.2bn – much lower than the $20bn originally targeted by the US government. The offering had encountered headwinds as AIG’s share price slid nearly 40 per cent from the start of the year.Elsewhere, Intel was up 1.7 per cent to $23.41 after the chipmaker announced a 16 per cent increase in its dividend, the second boost to its quarterly pay-out in the past six months.A number of other technology stocks were also in focus.Shares in IntraLinks Holdings tumbled 32.6 per cent to $20.22 after the software maker disappointed investors with its second-quarter profit forecast.Shares in STEC, a maker of flash-memory drives, fell 19.7 per cent to $16.11 after it forecast profits of no more than 30 cents a share in the second quarter, short of the average analyst estimate of 32 cents.But Rovi added 17.7 per cent to $58.48 after the maker of technology for home-entertainment systems said that its full-year earnings might be as high as $2.55 a share, more than the average analyst estimate of $2.36.
195;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-05-09T21:50:25Z;Wall St gains muted by eurozone debt fears;;Dollar Thrifty Automotive surged after Hertz Global offered to buy the car rental company, while the wider markets advanced after deal activity and a rise in commodities outweighed concerns over the financial health of the eurozone.Dollar Thrifty bounced 13.8 per cent to $79.27 after Hertz made a $2.2bn offer for its smaller rival.The offer is a 24 per cent premium over a rival offer made by Avis Budget last September, and is 17 per cent higher than the 60-day average share price.The move comes eight months after Hertz supposedly bowed out of a battle to buy Dollar Thrifty, saying it would not seek to match a higher offer by Avis. Shares in Hertz were down 1 per cent to $16.68 while Avis gained 0.3 per cent to $18.47.In other deal action, Alkermes said it would merge with a drug technology unit of Elan, the Irish drugmaker, in a cash and stock deal valued at $960m. Shares in Alkermes rose 5 per cent to $15.19.This assorted deal activity helped encourage sentiment across Wall Street, but the biggest gains came from the energy and material sectors as commodity prices rebounded.In the energy sector, Baker Hughes rose 3.4 per cent to $71.65 while Marathon Oil added 5.3 per cent to $52.19. The S&P energy index was up 1.6 per cent, paring some of the 7 per cent losses seen on the index last week.The S&P material sector was up 1.6 per cent, with US Steel adding 2.3 per cent to $46.67 and Newmont Mining rising 1.8 per cent to $54.69.This follows sharp losses for both of these sectors in the middle of last week as commodity prices fell sharply. On Thursday, oil prices fell more than $10 a barrel in the biggest one-day correction since the financial crisis, while other commodities such as silver and copper also lost ground.The gains in the session left the S&P 500 index up 0.5 per cent to 1,346.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 12,684.83 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,843.25.The positive impact on Wall Street was limited by concerns over peripheral eurozone finances after Standard & Poor’s cut Greece’s credit rating again. It comes as European officials acknowledged that Greece’s €110bn ($157bn) rescue package a year ago was insufficient and further help would be needed.On Friday the US markets were sent lower after rumours that Greece was in talks to exit the single currency. “Lingering sovereign debt concerns” could cause “additional volatility as the week progresses”, said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The downgrade news worried the financial sector, and the S&P financial index lost 0.2 per cent – the worst performing sector on Wall Street.Bank of America was down 1.1 per cent to $12.18 while Fifth Third Bancorp lost 1.5 per cent to $12.80.Elsewhere in the sector, Citigroup fell 2.3 per cent to $44.16 after putting into effect a one-for-10 reverse stock split. The move reduced the number of outstanding shares of Citigroup’s common stock from about 29bn to 2.9bn.Citigroup is the most actively traded stock in the US and the move helped bring about a relatively low-volume session.Elsewhere on Wall Street, homebuilding stocks were weighed down by worrying data showing that in the last few months US house prices suffered their largest drop in over two yearsAccording to figures from Zillow.com, the real estate website, home values fell 3 per cent in the first three months of 2011 from the previous quarter, and 1.1 per cent in March from the previous month. Prices have fallen for 57 consecutive months, according to Zillow.The news, a further sign that the US housing market is a long way from recovery, left shares in Lennar down 1.4 per cent to $18.28. Elsewhere in the homebuilding sector, DR Hortonwas 1 per cent lower at $11.81 while PulteGroupfell 2.1 per cent to $7.79.The S&P homebuilders index was down 1.5 per cent. The sector is 80 per cent lower than its pre-crisis peak.In other news, McDonald’s advanced 0.8 per cent to $79.31 after reporting that its same-store sales had risen 6 per cent in April, the biggest monthly increase since October.Tyson Foods was down 5.9 per cent to $17.77 after the world’s largest meat producer reported flat second-quarter earnings, as higher feed costs offset improving demand and higher meat prices.
196;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-05-05T22:12:23Z;Economic data weigh on Wall Street;;US equities continued to retreat from the multiyear highs reached last week, led lower by energy and material stocks as risk appetite was sapped by disappointing economic data and a mixed set of earnings reports.The big corporate news of the session was from General Motors, the largest of the Detroit carmakers, which reported a tripling in first-quarter earnings to $3.2bn.But this hefty growth in profits failed to impress investors as much of the improvement was due to one-time gains from the sale of stakes in former affiliates. The stock was down 3.1 per cent to $32.02 and the larger S&P auto index fell 0.4 per cent.In the wider markets, sentiment was weaker after weekly employment data showed that the number of jobless claims had unexpectedly surged to the highest level in eight months, raising concerns about the strength of the US labour market.This disappointing data followed weaker-than-expected ADP jobs data on Wednesday and bodes badly for the all-important official non-farm payroll data set to be released on Friday.These concerns left the S&P 500 down 0.9 per cent to 1,335.03, the fourth consecutive losing session on the index.The losses over the past week have been led by energy and material stocks as commodity prices have softened. This theme continued on Thursday as commodity prices plummeted.In the energy sector, Murphy Oil was down 6.4 per cent to $68.57 while ExxonMobil lost 2.6 per cent to $82.62. The S&P energy index fell 2.3 per cent, adding to the 5.1 per cent drop already this week.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, lost 2.5 per cent to $49.85 while Peabody Energy was down 3.6 per cent to $61.27. The S&P materials index was 1.3 per cent lower.Transport stocks were given a boost by the tumbling oil price, however, and the Dow transport index was up 1.1 per cent.But the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.1 per cent to 12,583.11 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,814.72.The recent downturn follows a raft of technical highs achieved by large benchmark indices last week. In the final few days of April, the S&P rose to a 35-month high, the Nasdaq reached a 10-year high and the Russell 2000 hit at an all-time high.“It is not clear yet if this is just a traditional correction following some technical highs, or it is the beginning of something more significant,” said Jonathan Lewis, chairman of the investment committee at Samson Capital Advisors.“Some unsettling questions have been raised of late by weak data on housing, manufacturing and gross domestic product growth,” he added.Late last month, government figures showed that US GDP growth slowed to 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2011 as rising oil prices weighed on consumer demand and government spending fell.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in JDS Uniphase bounced 6.9 per cent higher to $21.38 after the maker of optical communications reported a swing into a third-quarter profit, beating expectations with both its earnings and revenues.This helped the wider technology sector record some of the smallest losses on Wall Street. Motorola Mobility, the mobile phone maker, was up 3.8 per cent to $24.98 while Juniper Networks added 0.7 per cent to $37.54. The S&P technology index was down only 0.5 per cent.In other positive news, Whole Foods Market, the natural and organic grocer, reported a 33 per cent rise in second-quarter profit and lifted its full-year earnings forecast. Shares in the company were up 0.4 per cent to $59.95.Since the earnings season began, however, the number of companies that have beaten expectations with their results has been in decline.Two weeks after the start of the season in early April, 80 per cent of companies had beaten analysts’ expectations with their quarterly earnings results. At the end of April, the positive surprise rate was 76 per cent, but now the rate stands at 73 per cent with slightly more than 100 companies left to report.Elsewhere, Kindle International soared 57.7 per cent to $14.98 after privately held INC Research agreed to buy the clinical research company late on Wednesday for $232m.Shares in CVS Caremark added 1.9 per cent to $36.79 after the drugstore and pharmacy company reported earnings that beat analysts’ expectations, although profits were down and margins were slimmer.
197;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-05-04T21:51:22Z;Energy leads further Wall Street retreat;;"US indices retreated further from multiyear highs achieved last week after disappointing economic data, softer commodity prices and a number of lacklustre earnings reports.The sharpest falls came from the energy sector, with National Oilwell Varco, the oilfield services company, falling 3.4 per cent to $69.92 and Cameron International losing 4.1 per cent to $48.70.ExxonMobil, the largest company in the world by market capitalisation, was down 0.9 per cent to $84.81 as the oil price fell back. The S&P energy index was off 1.6 per cent.“The fall in commodity prices should eventually be a good thing for the markets but in the meantime it is weighing heavily on the energy and material sectors,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.Energy stocks had led the rally in US equities over the past six months.Since the end of September, the S&P energy index has risen 49 per cent while the broader S&P 500 index is up 28.5 per cent.But this pattern has started to change in the past few weeks, with April the first month in almost a year where energy stocks did not outperform the benchmark S&P 500 index.The S&P energy index is down 1.2 per cent this month.Material stocks also lost ground in the session. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, fell 3.9 per cent to $51.14 while Cliff Natural Resources lost 4.1 per cent to $87.55. The S&P materials sector was down 1.7 per cent.These losses left the S&P 500 index down 0.7 per cent to 1,347.32 at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also 0.7 per cent softer at 12,723.12, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,828.23.Weak economic data weighed on sentiment across the wider markets, leaving all of the major S&P sectoral indices trading lower.The biggest disappointment was over the ISM non-manufacturing composite index, which plunged to 52.8 in April from 57.3 the previous month in a worrying sign of the rate of growth in the US services sector. However, a reading above 50 still indicates expansion.Separately, employment data from Automatic Data Processing estimated that the private sector had added 179,000 jobs in April, below the 200,000 economists had expected. The ADP data is significant as it is the first in a slew of crucial employment numbers to be released this week.The big event will be on Friday, when the official, monthly non-farm payroll numbers are set to be released, but before that there are the weekly numbers on Thursday.Some weak earnings results also kept market sentiment lower. Las Vegas Sands fell 7.4 per cent to $42.50 after the casino resort operator missed analysts’ earnings and revenue forecasts.Elsewhere, Kellogg, the cereal company, reported a 12 per cent drop in earnings and slimmer gross margins for the first quarter, sending its shares down 1.2 per cent to $56.78. Investors reacted negatively to the news as the maker of Rice Krispies and Pop-Tarts became the latest in a long line of companies to feel rising commodity costs.Last week, Procter & Gamble said it had underestimated commodity inflation in “a very difficult operating environment”.Kimberly-Clark and Nike have also reported weaker results this season thanks to higher commodity prices.In deal news, Applied Materials, the US semiconductor equipment maker, announced plans to buy rival Varian Semiconductor in a $4.9bn cash deal. The news sent shares in Varian up 51.3 per cent to $61.36, while Applied Materials lost 1 per cent to $15.09.Elsewhere, ConAgra Foods announced it had made a $4.9bn cash offer to acquireRalcorp, the cereal maker, in a deal that would make ConAgra the third-largest US packaged foods company by revenues.This sent shares in Ralcorp up 4.9 per cent to $87.39 while ConAgra Foods added 3.1 per cent to $25.51.Renren, China’s leading real-name social networking service, saw its shares surge 28.6 per cent to $18.01 on its trading debut in New York.The Beijing-based company, which is unlisted in China, had priced its initial public offering at $14 per share to raise $743m, at the top of its projected range
of $12-$14."
198;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-05-02T22:04:22Z;Pharmaceuticals boost US sentiment;;"Deal activity lifted the healthcare sector to a multiyear high, but the wider markets closed slightly lower as the market euphoria following the news of Osama bin Laden’s death fizzled out and investors turned their attention back to more humdrum
economic matters.Teva Pharmaceuticals, a generic drugmaker with its headquarters in Israel, announced a $6.8bn deal on Monday to purchase Cephalon, the US pharmaceutical company, helping to lift the wider healthcare sector.The news sent shares in Cephalon up 4 per cent to $80.11, near its all-time high, while Teva’s American shares added 3.4 per cent to $47.27.The deal will see Teva pay $81.50 a share, outgunning a $73 a share hostile approach for Cephalon made in March by Valeant. Shares in Valeant fell 5.8 per cent to $49.58 on the news.Elsewhere in the sector, Forest Laboratories added 4.8 per cent to $34.74 and Watson Pharmaceutical rose 2.2 per cent to $63.36. The S&P healthcare index put on 1 per cent. That performance made it the best performing sector on Wall Street and took the index to a three-year high.In the wider market, the S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,361.21, weighed on primarily by energy stocks as oil prices softened. Halliburton was down 3.1 per cent to $48.92 while Schlumberger lost 2.2 per cent to $87.79. The S&P energy sector lost 1.3 per cent.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average flat at 12,806.83, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,864.08.Healthy ISM manufacturing data helped to limit losses on Wall Street. The data showed a slightly less robust manufacturing expansion in April than the previous month, but the 60.4 reading still indicated a healthy rate of growth in the sector.News on Sunday night that Osama bin Laden had been killed prompted a “risk on” trade across the world and left Wall Street higher in early trading. But the markets fell flat shortly after lunch and then began to tick lower as investors took a more even-handed look at the real market implications of the news.“Obviously there has been a little bit of euphoria and a sense of relief following bin Laden’s death, but fundamentally this news has little relevance for the equity markets,” said Matthew Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management.“The markets are more interested in fundamental factors like the success of the current earnings season,” he said.The earnings season so far has been solid. Of the 302 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings, 76 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations, compared with 73 per cent last quarter.The materials, consumer discretionary and financial sectors have been the best performing, on average beating analysts’ earnings expectations by about 13 per cent, according to Bloomberg data.The best performing stocks in the material sector have been Freeport-McMoRan and Nucor, which reported earnings 24 per cent and 41 per cent higher than expected, respectively.In the consumer discretionary area, Whirlpool and Ford Motor have reported some of the biggest “beats”, with their earnings coming in 32 per cent and 25 per cent higher than estimates. Among financials, SunTrust beat estimates by 103 per cent and Goldman Sachs by 92 per cent.Since the start of the earnings season on April 11 when Alcoa reported, the S&P materials index has risen 2.1 per cent. In the same period, the financial index has dipped 0.9 per cent and the consumer discretionary index has gained 4.2 per cent.Looking back to Monday’s session, deal activity in the materials sector also helped lift sentiment in the wider market. International Coal Group jumped 30.8 per cent to $14.43 after Arch Coal said it had agreed a $3.4bn deal with the coal producer.Arch said it would pay $14.60 per share for its smaller rival, a 32 per cent premium to the closing stock price on Friday. Shares in Arch were down 2.2 per cent to $33.53.Alcoa was up 1.3 per cent to $17.22 after the aluminium producer was raised to “buy” from “neutral” at Goldman Sachs.In earnings news, Dish Network, the satellite television provider, was up
19 per cent to $29.79 as the company reported that its first-quarter profit had more than doubled, helped by a patent settlement with TiVo."
199;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-04-25T18:43:18Z;Barrick shall not live by gold alone;;Barrick Gold cannot continue to grow through gold alone, the world’s biggest producer of the yellow metal acknowledged while agreeing to buy a second-tier copper producer for C$7.3bn ($7.6bn).The admission of Peter Munk, chairman, has repercussions for a mining industry that may now see Barrick as a cash-rich competitor for the world’s best copper assets. At the same time Barrick could find it harder to justify the premium valuation accorded to “pure” gold miner, according to mining industry insiders.“It is very difficult to offer unlimited growth when you are a company our size,” Mr Munk told the Financial Times. “In gold it is difficult to find any acquisitions that could be immediately accretive to earnings. It is really important to expand our copper earnings and copper production.”“To move the dial is quite an undertaking,” he added, for a company that far surpassed gold-mining rivals by selling 7.7m gold ounces last year and achieving net profits of $3.3bn.Mr Munk said Barrick was not trying to become a diversified miner like Rio Tinto or BHP Billiton, saying copper is the only non-gold metal where it desires significant expansion. “We are not in that mode of diversification,” he said, referring to Rio.A closer analogy may be Freeport McMoran, the US copper and gold producer. Freeport sold 3.9bn pounds of copper last year and 1.9m ounces of gold. That represents a more balanced portfolio than Barrick, which sold 7.7m ounces of gold and 391m pounds of copper.Barrick’s move into the copper market, however, comes at a time when Rio, BHP, Freeport, and other multinational miners are hunting for growth in copper. The metal’s high price reflects a stagnating supply base amid expectations of rising demand for years to come.Minmetals, the Chinese state-owned miner, was among the multinationals targeting copper assets.Barrick has gatecrashed Minmetals’ bid for Equinox with its C$7.3bn agreed deal. The competition for Equinox – whose value is based around a single mine in Zambia – is one sign that the metal is taking on an aura traditionally reserved for gold.“It’s a big call to go against the Chinese in African copper,” said a veteran banker to multinational mining companies, adding it was not at all certain that Minmetals would cede the contest.The banker outlined dangers to Barrick’s rating if it becomes a more balanced copper and gold producer: “Barrick is a gold company, and its multiple relies on investors trusting that it is heavily weighted to gold.”When Minmetals unveiled its bid for Equinox, some mining analysts questioned whether the Chinese miner was overpaying and basing its investment on rosy assumptions about the long-term copper price.Industry advisers suggested that Barrick was paying above the 6 to 8 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation that copper assets tend to fetch.Analysts at GMP Securities said in a research note that the offer represented an 8.6 times multiple of forecast ebitda for 2011, versus a historical average of 6.5 times for purchases of base metals companies.Aaron Regent, Barrick’s chief executive, defended the price that is 16 per cent higher than Minmetals’ offer. He pointed to the potential for growth in the Zambian copper belt, saying that Africa had the best potential for copper mining after Latin America, where Barrick already has sizeable interests.Brazil’s Vale has also signaled its interest in the copper belt – the copper and cobalt-rich region that runs along the border of Zambia and Democratic Republic of Congo – with its recent $1.1bn bid for Metorex.Barrick’s agreed offer has not yet succeeded. But Barrick, with cash of $4bn last year, has suggested this could be the first of several acquisitions.“In stock markets where your stock [value] is all about growth more than size, growth becomes important. But it is increasingly difficult to achieve. That means you have to keep acquiring,” Mr Munk said.Additional reporting by Helen Thomas in New York
200;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-04-20T17:38:59Z;BHP Billiton lowers oil production outlook;;BHP Billiton lowered its outlook for oil production amid continued drilling permit delays in the Gulf of Mexico.BHP’s total petroleum production fell 4 per cent, to 35.8m equivalent barrels, in the quarter to March 31 against both the prior quarter and the same period last year.“Permitting delays in the Gulf of Mexico continue to impact our petroleum operations, further deferring the drilling of high volume production wells,” said BHP, whose financial year ends in June 2011.“We therefore expect production to be lower in the 2012 financial year.”The company also said it would spend less money than expected on oil exploration because of the delays facing its deepwater drilling programme.Copper production for the world’s biggest miner fell 9 per cent quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a sector-wide stagnation of the copper supply base despite high prices.The impact of flooding in Queensland was clear in lower production of coking coal, which fell to 6.7m tonnes from 7.8m in the prior quarter and 8.2m in same period last year. However, the financial impact of marginally lower production in some commodities stands to be offset by high prices.RBC Capital Markets said it expects quarterly earnings per share for diversified miners to rise 6 per cent against the last quarter and 101 per cent against the same quarter last year.Freeport-McMoRan, the US-listed copper producer, on Tuesday set the tone for first-quarter earnings among metals miners. Freeport’s first-quarter net profits rose from $897m last year to $1.5bn (£920m).The financial gain came despite Freeport producing less copper now than a year ago. Both BHP and Freeport saw copper production fall by more than 5 per cent in the latest quarter compared with the prior period.Freeport said on Tuesday it would add a 50 cent supplementary dividend to its 25 cent regular pay-out, in the latest indication of the financial windfall it is distributing to shareholders.BHP appeared to maintain its momentum ahead of a June-end financial year that could be one of its most profitable on record.The strongest indication came from iron ore, which is its most valuable commodity. In the three-quarters to March it produced 99m tonnes of iron ore, a 6 per cent gain on the same period last time.
201;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-04-15T18:15:43Z;Earnings leave Wall Street stocks flat;;Disappointing results from Bank of America and Google weighed on the financial and technology sectors, but strong manufacturing and consumer sentiment data left the wider markets higher in the final session of a lacklustre week for US equities.Bank of America reported a 36 per cent decline in first-quarter profit as the foreclosures crisis continued to squeeze its home loan business.Earnings came in at $2bn, or $0.17 per share, falling short of the $0.26 per share expected by analysts.This left the stock down 2.3 per cent to $12.83, with news that the bank had made a deal with Assured Guaranty to resolve all its mortgage repurchase claims serving to limit further losses on the stock.Bank of America shares have fallen 33.9 per cent in the past year, the worst-performing stock in the 24-company BKX banking index, thanks partly to worries over its mortgage liabilities.The results weighed slightly on the financial sector, with Capital One losing 0.4 per cent to $50.03 and Regions Financial falling 1 per cent to $7.17. The BKX banking index was down 0.2 per cent.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in Google dropped 8.3 per cent to $530.70 after the internet search group reported a 54 per cent jump in first-quarter operating costs.The news raised fears that Google was facing a deterioration in its underlying cost structure as it tried to maintain growth. The higher costs left profits below expectations, with pro forma earnings per share reaching $8.08, against the $8.13 analysts had forecast.These results dragged on the wider technology sector. Shares in Cognizant Technology Solutions were down 2.6 per cent to $78.72 while Yahoo lost 0.4 per cent to $16.62. The S&P technology index was down 0.4 per cent, the worst performing S&P sub-index.In spite of this, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,319.68 – down 0.6 per cent over the week – after the Empire State manufacturing survey showed that economic activity was expanding faster than expected in the New York area.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced that its manufacturing index rose to 21.7 in April, ahead of the 17 point reading expected by economists. A figure greater than zero signals expansion.The Empire State index is the first of several regional manufacturing gauges to be released each month, although that from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve is seen as the most significant as a gauge of the strength of the wider economy.The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index also came in slightly better than expected at 69.6. In other economic data, US prices rose 0.5 per cent in March according to the Labor Department. This was the ninth straight month of increases in the consumer price index, but it was in line with forecasts, and so did little to sway the markets.Overall, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent at 12,341.98 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 2,764.65. The indices have lost 0.3 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively in the past five days.The disappointing week on Wall Street began with sharp losses in energy and material stocks as commodity prices softened. This was partly due to Goldman Sachs advising clients to lock in profits on oil and other commodities.Lower than expected quarterly revenue from Alcoa, the first S&P company to report results, compounded negative sentiment in the material sector. Alcoa was down 7.8 per cent to $16.52 over the week while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, lost 10.6 per cent to $51.17.The S&P material sector fell 2.3 per cent over the week while the energy sector lost 3.1 per cent.Towards the end of the week, financial stocks were in focus after the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations found that banks, including Goldman Sachs, had mis-sold mortgage-backed securities and misled investors and lawmakers. Shares in Goldman were down 3.6 per cent to $155.13 over the week while the S&P financial sector lost 2 per cent.JPMorgan Chase was down 4.2 per cent to $44.89, despite releasing quarterly results on Wednesday that beat forecasts.Arcos Dorados, the world’s largest McDonald’s franchisee, saw a strong opening week of trading, rising 25.5 per cent to $21.36. Zipcar, the web-based hourly car rental group, was similarly successful, trading at $27.16 – 52.6 per cent above where the IPO originally priced.
202;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-04-12T20:41:59Z;Energy and materials lead Wall Street lower;;"Alcoa tumbled after reporting slower-than-expected revenue growth, while the broader markets were dragged into the red by energy and material stocks as commodity prices slid.The aluminium producer reported earnings that topped expectations after the closing bell on Monday, but revenue fell short of forecasts leaving the shares down 6 per cent to $16.70 on Tuesday. It was the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 index.Alcoa, which was the first S&P company to report its quarterly results this earnings season, reported improved sales and higher prices in most major markets, but its overall revenue fell short of the $6.06bn expected, coming in at $5.96bn.The company also warned of higher energy and raw material prices increasing its cost of producing the metal. But the stock is still up 8.5 per cent since the start of the year, beating the benchmark S&P 500 index, which is up 4.5 per cent. This disappointing start to the results season helped drag down sentiment in the wider markets, leaving the S&P 500 index down 0.8 per cent to 1,314.16.Rumours that Tyco International, the maker of security systems, had been approached with a $30bn takeover bid by Schneider Electric sent Tyco up 7.4 per cent to $52.33, but did nothing to assuage the sense of gloom in the markets.“The Alcoa results obviously weighed heavily on market sentiment,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “The fact that they sounded the alarm about higher costs also supports the view that this earnings season will be overshadowed by the effects of rising material costs,” he said.Also helping to lower sentiment on Wall Street was data from the National Federation of Independent Business, which showed that small business confidence had fallen to its lowest point in five months.The index dropped 2.6 points to 91.9, below the 95 point reading that had been expected. Much of the downward pressure on the index came from the “expect a better economy” component, which fell to minus five from nine-plus.“This is disappointing, but we hope it is a one-time move in response to the jump in oil prices,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.Not helping risk appetite was news that the severity rating of the crisis at the Fukushima nuclear power plant has been upgraded to the same level as that of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite down 1 per cent to 12,263.58 and 2,744.79 respectively.But the biggest drag on the wider indices were energy and material stocks, which lost substantial ground as commodity prices retreated. This was partly due to news that Goldman Sachs had advised clients to lock in profits on oil and other commodities as they looked vulnerable to a short-term correction.As oil prices dropped sharply lower, the S&P energy sector tumbled 3 per cent, the worst performing S&P sub index. ExxonMobil dropped 2.3 per cent to $83.18, while Chevron slid 3.3 per cent to $104.18. In the oilfield services sector, Halliburton was down 3.4 per cent to $45.34.The price of other commodities also retreated in the session, leading material stocks lower. Freeport-McMoRan, the copper producer, was down 3.1 per cent to $53.70 and Consol Energy, the coal miner, lost 2.9 per cent to $48.89. The S&P materials index was down 1.3 per cent.Primerica fell 2.3 per cent to $23.47 after Citigroup said it was offering at least 12m shares in the life-insurance business it took public about a year ago.WMS Industries, the slot machines maker, cut its revenue view for its fiscal third quarter and projected earnings below analysts’ estimates. Its shares were down 17.2 per cent to $30.01.Level 3 Communications, the internet video and communications network operator, were down 1.8 per cent to $1.67, paring some of the 18.1 per cent gains in the previous session. The gains on Monday came after the company agreed to acquire Global Crossing, the IP solutions provider, in an
all-stock offer valued at roughly $1.9bn.Safe Bulkers lost 10.4 per cent to $8.30 after the provider of marine dry-bulk transportation services said it would offer 5m shares, in part to fund ship acquisitions. Micrel, the semiconductor maker, was down 8.9 per cent to $13.12 after it cut its earnings outlook for the first quarter."
203;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-04-11T20:47:43Z;Wall St energy shares hit by growth report;;News that Endo Pharmaceuticals was acquiring American Medical Systems helped lift the healthcare sector, but the wider markets lost ground, led by commodity stocks after the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecasts for the US and Japan.The S&P healthcare sector saw the strongest gains on Wall Street, rising 0.5 per cent, after Endo announced a $2.6bn acquisition for AMS, a maker of medical devices. The deal is set to close in the third quarter of this year and is expected to create $50m in synergies by 2013.Shares in Endo rose 0.5 per cent to $41.06, falling back in late trading from earlier 5 per cent gains, while AMS shares surged 32.1 per cent to $29.50. Elsewhere in the sector, Biogen was up 7.2 per cent to $78.55 after a successful trial for its multiple sclerosis treatment while Forest Laboratories added 4.1 per cent to $34.21.But in the wider markets, the S&P 500 index lost 0.3 per cent to 1,324.46, adding to the 0.4 per cent losses on Friday. The energy sector saw the sharpest losses following the IMF report which reduced its forecast for US growth in 2011 to 2.8 per cent from 3 per cent.Cameron International, the oilfield services company, was down 3.5 per cent to $53.54 as oil prices lost ground while Baker Hughes lost 3.2 per cent to $69.31. The S&P energy sector was down 1.9 per cent.The material sectors also saw strong losses with Freeport-McMoRan, the copper producer, falling 3.1 per cent to $55.44 and Consol Energy, the coal miner, losing 4.2 per cent to $50.34.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed flat in the session at 12,381.11 while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent at 2,771.51.Before the IMF report the markets were slightly higher with traders looking optimistically towards the upcoming earnings season. Over the next few weeks almost two-thirds of the companies in the S&P 500 will report their first-quarter earnings.“We look set to have a very healthy earnings season,” said Kate Warne, market strategist at Edward Jones. “Although I think that there will likely be fewer earnings surprises than in recent quarters.”Analysts are expecting that stocks on the S&P 500 will see earnings per share growth of 11 per cent in the first quarter from the same period a year ago, according to Bloomberg data. This is a significantly slower growth rate than the 36 per cent jump in the fourth quarter of 2010, but the growth is coming from a higher base.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, reported earnings that topped analysts forecasts after the closing bell on Monday.The company reported earnings excluding restructuring costs and other one-time items of 28 cents a share, topping the 27 cents expected by analysts. The stock was down 0.8 per cent to $17.77 ahead of the result.This week will also see earnings reports by JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday and Google on Thursday.There was more deal activity in the telecommunications sector. Level 3 Communications, the internet video and communications network operator, said it had agreed to acquire Global Crossing, the IP solutions provider, in an all-stock offer valued at roughly $1.9bn.The news sent shares in Level 3 up 18.1 per cent to $1.70 and Global Crossing up 68.7 per cent to $24.97.In other deal news, Tyco International jumped 3.3 per cent to $48.72 following unconfirmed reports that Schneider Electric was weighing up a takeover offer for the maker of security systems.Shares in NYSE Euronext, the largest exchange operator in the US, lost ground after its board unanimously voted on Sunday to reject the offer from Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, which was intended to break up the planned merger with Deutsche Börse.In a statement, the NYSE Euronext board said the deal with Deutsche Börse would “create substantially more long-term value for shareholders, and is significantly more likely to close”.Shares in NYSE lost 2.9 per cent to $37.59. Nasdaq fell 1.5 per cent to $28.03.Viasystems Group, the electronics manufacturer, was down 2.7 per cent to $25 after saying that it expected “minor impacts” from the Japanese earthquake on the flow of supplies.Monsanto, which reported disappointing results last week, was up 1.4 per cent to $67.17 after the seed producer was upgraded by Deutsche Bank to “buy” from “hold”.
204;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-04-08T21:14:39Z;Wall St down on poor economic data;;"Shares in Expedia advanced after the online travel company announced it was splitting in two, but the wider markets lost ground after disappointing economic data and hawkish comments from a Federal Reserve official, leaving the S&P 500 index lower over the week.Investors reacted positively to the news that Expedia was spinning off its lucrative TripAdvisor business, sending shares in the company up 13 per cent
to $25.30. Analysts roundly approved of the move, saying that the plan could help unlock value for the high-growth and high-margin TripAdvisor. “We view such corporate activity as a positive catalyst for Expedia shareholders,” said analysts at Citi Investment Research.The S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent at 1,328.11, leaving the index down 0.3 per cent over the week. Sentiment was subdued by economic data showing that the inventories of US wholesalers rose in February but their sales fell, a sign of uncertainty in the economic recovery.The markets were also unsettled by comments from Richard Fisher, the president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, who said that the central bank was near the “tipping point” where it should start to focus more on combating inflation than stimulating employment.Not helping sentiment was the growing threat of a government shutdown as US lawmakers struggled to agree on a 2012 budget before midnight.Historical evidence suggests that the market impact of a shutdown would not be devastating. In the five-day period in November 1995 that the government was shut down, the S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent. During the subsequent 21-day shutdown later on that year the index added 0.1 per cent.Still, as the shutdown loomed the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent o 12,379.90 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.6 per cent lower at 2,780.41. The Dow was flat over the week and the Nasdaq fell 0.3 per cent.The energy sector was one of the few winners in the session, led by oilfield services stocks as oil prices climber higher. Nabors Industries, the world’s largest land rig contractor, added 3.5 per cent to $31.56 while Helmerich & Payne gained 2.2 per cent to $68.98. The S&P energy index was up 0.4 per cent.Elsewhere in the energy sector Hercules Offshore lost ground after announcing that it was under investigation by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shares in the oil exploration group were down 11.3 per cent to $5.66.Seagate Technology added 7.6 per cent to $15.84 after the hard-disk manufacturer reported third-quarter sales that topped analyst estimates and said that it would reinstate its dividend payments.The mood on Wall Street was cautious as investors paused for breath following a 6 per cent rally in the previous weeks when the markets were bouncing back from losses sustained during the turmoil in north Africa, the Middle East and Japan. There was also little economic data to direct the markets and many traders were waiting for the start of the earnings season next week.“The markets are just passing the time at the moment and will need months of good employment news before they get their next leg up. This will likely happen in the summer and take the S&P 500 up to 1,450,” said Linda Duessel, senior portfolio manager at Federated Investors. This suggests the markets will put on another 8.7 per cent before the end of the year, adding to the 5.6 per cent already put on.The materials sector saw some of the biggest gains over the week, lifted by deal activity in the sector and rising commodity prices.On Monday, Molycorp, which owns a rare earth mine in California, purchased a 90 per cent stake in AS Silmet, a rare earth processing facility in Europe, in a deal valued at $89m. Elsewhere, China’s Minmetals Resources launched a C$6.3bn bid for Equinox Minerals.Molycorp was up 13.4 per cent to $67.19 over the week while Equinox Minerals gained 35.8 per cent to $8.05. The S&P materials sector was up 0.2 per cent over the five days.The S&P retail sector was up 1.2 per cent over the week after a series of strong March same-store sales growth figures from key industry players. Costco Wholesale, the discount retailer, reported that same-store sales were up 13 per cent in March, beating analysts’ expectations and sending the shares up 2.9 per cent to $76.41 over the week.The markets were briefly shaken on Thursday by news that another earthquake had hit Japan, but recovered quickly."
205;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-04-06T21:10:35Z;Tech stocks lift Wall Street higher;;Cisco Systems led the gains in the technology sector after a candid admission of management failures led to hopes of a turnround. But losses in the materials and energy sectors weighed on Wall Street, leaving the wider indices only slightly higher in the session.Shares in the internet equipment company were up 4.9 per cent to $18.07 after John Chambers, chief executive, made a rare admission of failure and signalled a shake-up to refocus Cisco on its most important markets.He said that the company’s strategy was “sound”, but added that they had been slow to make decisions and had “lost the accountability that has been a hallmark of our ability to execute consistently for our customers”.Cisco’s stock has fallen 27 per cent since the start of 2010 at a time when the Nasdaq Composite has risen by 23.4 per cent.Elsewhere in the technology sector, semiconductor stocks saw gains. These were led by Broadcom, the chipmaker, which added 3.9 per cent to $39.95 after Oppenheimer upgraded its rating on the stock from “perform” to “outperform”, citing the growth in wireless markets and networking.This helped related semiconductor stocks. Advanced Micro Devices was up 4 per cent to $8.43, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose 1.5 per cent, adding to the 2.3 per cent gain in the previous session. Sentiment in the sector continued to be high following Texas Instruments’ agreed $6.5bn deal to acquire National Semiconductor.Overall, the S&P technology sector was up 0.7 per cent, the best performing S&P sub-index. The benchmark S&P 500 was only up 0.2 per cent at 1,335.54.In the energy sector, oilfield service stocks were the worst performing. Cameron International lost 2.5 per cent to $55.30 while Halliburton fell 2.6 per cent to $48.41. The S&P energy sector was 0.9 per cent softer.In the materials sector, it was coal miners that suffered the most as investor confidence in global demand took a turn. Massey Energy fell 3.5 per cent to $67.59 while Peabody Energy declined 3.7 per cent to $69.56.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite were up 0.3 per cent to 12,427.13 and 2,799.82 respectively.The S&P 500 index has now added 6.2 per cent this year boosted by a sense that the fundamentals of the US economy are improving. “Macro outlook in the US is slightly more positive compared to the past few quarters. Economic sentiment in Europe remains choppy, but trends appear to be stabilising,” said analysts at Citi Investment Research.Technical analysts at JPMorgan Securities argued that in the short term the S&P was likely to see highs of 1,344, while in the second quarter the index was likely to trade between 1,353 and 1,367.Over the year the S&P 500 would face a ceiling of between 1,420 and 1,440, they argued, suggesting the S&P could still rise a further 7.8 per cent this year at its peak, on top of the 6.2 per cent added already.In corporate news, shares in Monsanto lost ground after the world’s largest seed company by revenues reported disappointing revenues, sending the shares down 5.7 per cent to $69.16. But the company also beat estimates for its earnings per share and confirmed guidance for the year.American Superconductor tumbled 41.6 per cent to $14.47 after the maker of wind turbine components and transmission lines said it expected to report a loss for the fiscal fourth quarter after Sinovel Wind Group refused to accept shipments.Cephalon was down 0.5 per cent to $77.02 after the drugmaker rejected the $5.7bn bid offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, saying that the offer undervalued the company.Dish Network, the satellite television provider, was fractionally higher at $24.32 after it won an auction to buy the bankrupt Blockbuster film rental chain for $320m. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy protection in September with debt of more than $1.4bn and assets of $1bn.Transatlantic Holdings added 2.8 per cent to $50.60 after the reinsurer formerly owned by American International Group said that its first-quarter catastrophes cost was $355m, including about $240m from last month’s Japanese earthquake and tsunami.Optical networking stocks saw gains. JDS Uniphase added 2.3 per cent to $19.58 while Oclaro rose 7.6 per cent to $11.72.
206;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-04-05T20:53:51Z;Wall Street flat after Fed minutes;;The technology sector was in focus after Texas Instruments said it would buy National Semiconductor and Nasdaq OMX unveiled plans to rebalance the Nasdaq 100 index, helping the wider markets to tick higher for another day.The semiconductor sector was given a boost after Texas Instruments, the chipmaker, announced its biggest deal in more than a decade, with a $6.5bn all-cash agreed offer for National Semiconductor.The news sent shares in National Semiconductor up 71 per cent at $24.06 while Texas Instruments added 1.7 per cent to $34.69.Elsewhere in the sector, STMicroelectronics was up 2.7 per cent to $12.75 while Avago Technologies rose 3.5 per cent to $31.67.

Cisco Systems, the network equipment maker, 0.9 per cent to $17.22.The biggest loser from the rebalancing was Apple, which will see its weighting in the index decline from more than 20 per cent to just over 12 per cent. It lost 0.7 per cent to $338.89.Elsewhere in the sector, Google was down 3.2 per cent to $569.09 after reports from Bloomberg that the US Federal Trade Commission is considering launching an antitrust investigation into the company’s dominance of the internet search industry. Overall, the S&P technology index was down 0.1 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 was flat at 1,332.63, falling back from slight gains earlier in the session after the minutes of the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting were released.The minutes held no surprises, but it did show that the Federal Reserve will not taper off its current $600bn round of asset purchases as they come to an end in June, but just bring the programme to a halt.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost less than 0.1 per cent to 12,393.90 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent to 2,791.19.Sentiment in the wider markets was not helped by news that the US service sector has grown by less than expected in March, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing activity.The index showed a reading of 57.3, down from 59.7 in February and short of the 59.5 expected. However, a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector so the news was not terrible.Traders were also waiting apprehensively for the minutes of the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting.The S&P 500 is now up 6 per cent in the past three weeks, bouncing back from the 6.4 per cent losses sustained following the onset of turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.The index is still 0.8 per cent down from the mid-February high for the S&P before the geopolitical tensions began to affect the markets.The recent gains have occurred in very low volume trading, as some investors have decided to wait on the sidelines for geopolitical tensions to recede.March saw the lightest trading volumes on S&P 500 stocks since December 1999, according to data from LPL Financial Research.On Tuesday, the materials sector saw the strongest gains, with investors shaking off news that China had raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, advanced 1.5 per cent to $56.61 while AK Steel added 3.6 per cent to $16.54. The S&P materials sector rose 1.1 per cent.Shares in Procter & Gamble were in focus after the world’s largest consumer goods company made its final exit from the food sector, selling its Pringles potato chip business to Diamond Foods for $2.35bn.The move sent shares in P&G down 1 per cent to $61.67, but shares in Diamond Foods rose 6.7 per cent to $61.06.Homebuilders lost ground after KB Home reported a 25 per cent decline in revenue in the first quarter. Shares in the Los Angeles housebuilder retreated 4.2 per cent to $11.69.Elsewhere in the sector, DR Horton declined 1.8 per cent to $11.26 while Beazer Homes slid 2.6 per cent to $4.51.Expedia, the online travel reservation company, was up 1.3 per cent to $22.72 after resolving a dispute with American Airlines which will allow it to resume selling the carrier’s tickets.
207;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-04-04T20:54:17Z;US airlines hit by Southwest woes;;Shares in Southwest Airlines lost ground after a problem with one of its planes on Friday caused hundreds of its flights to be cancelled over the weekend, while the wider markets were broadly flat as gains in the materials sector were balanced by losses in technology stocks.The largest US airline by number of domestic passengers lost 1.7 per cent to $12.46 following the news that one of its aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing when a hole formed in its canopy.This then prompted planes to be grounded over the weekend and Monday as the airline examined its planes looking for metal fatigue and cracks.Related stocks also lost ground in the session. AMR, American Airlines’ parent company, was down 1.9 per cent to $6.27 while Hawaiian Holdings lost 2.5 per cent to $5.88.In the wider markets US equities struggled for direction, with the S&P 500 moving only fractionally higher to 1,332.87. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 12,399.96, just a hair’s breadth away from 12,400, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,789.19.The materials sector led the gains, boosted by deal activity and slightly higher commodity prices. Molycorp, which owns a rare earth mine in California, was up 12 per cent to $66.34, after it purchased a 90 per cent stake in AS Silmet, a rare earth processing facility in Europe, in a deal valued at $89m.Elsewhere, China’s Minmetals Resources launched a C$6.3bn hostile bid for Equinox Minerals, sending US shares in the Toronto-based miner up 30.1 per cent to $7.76.Massey Energy, the coal miner, was up 0.9 per cent to $69.87 while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, added 1.3 per cent to $55.77. The S&P materials sector was up 0.7 per cent.But these gains were balanced out by losses in the technology sector after the Semiconductor Industry Association said global sales of semiconductors fell 1.1 per cent in February from the previous month to $25.2bn.Avago Technologies, a semiconductor company, lost 2.9 per cent to $30.60 while Nvidia, the graphics chipmaker, fell 3.6 per cent to $17.55. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.9 per cent while the S&P technology index fell 0.5 per cent, the worst performing of the S&P 500 sectors.This neutral session followed on from 0.5 per cent gains on Friday after news that 216,000 US jobs had been created in March and that the unemployment rate had fallen to a two-year low at 8.8 per cent.The S&P 500 is now up 6 per cent in the past three weeks, bouncing back from the losses sustained following the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East. The index is 0.7 per cent below the mid-February high for the S&P before the geopolitical tensions began to affect the markets.According to Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, a New York-based hedge fund, technicals are going to be key over the coming months.He argues that if the S&P advances past 1,344, the mid-February high before the revolt in Egypt, then the index will continue up to 1,400. “If it fails to get to 1,344, we are going to retest the floor of 1,280,” he said.In corporate news, shares in Ambassadors International plunged 76.8 per cent to $0.65 after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday. Ambassador is the parent company of Windstar Cruises, the cruise ship operator.In the preceding two days shares in the company had rocketed in value, gaining 194.7 per cent.Pfizer, the drugmaker, added 0.8 per cent to $20.54 after agreeing to sell Capsugel, the world’s largest maker of hard capsules, to private equity group KKR for $2.4bn in cash.The sale will allow Pfizer to buy back common stock this year in excess of the $5bn in repurchases it was planning. But Pfizer also lowered its revenue forecast for 2011 and trimmed its 2012 revenue guidance as a result of the deal.Shares in Ford Motor continued to gain ground after news on Friday that it had overtaken General Motors as North America’s top-selling carmaker in March, while reporting a 19 per cent gain in US sales.The carmaker was up 2.6 per cent to $15.56, helped by an upgrade by Credit Suisse to “neutral” from “underperform”.Shares of defence contractor General Dynamics fell 5.2 per cent to $73.37 after Gulfstream Aerospace, its business jet unit, said that a jet crashed during a test flight on Saturday.
208;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-04-03T18:31:39Z;Miners turn to hedging as copper rally stalls;;Miners have started to protect themselves against a fall in the price of copper as the metal’s rally, which only a few months ago looked unstoppable, has hit a wall.There is growing nervousness in the copper market as investors begin to doubt the strength of demand from China. The price of the metal, a crucial element in the global economy that is found in almost every building and electrical circuit, has slipped 8 per cent since it hit a record high of $10,190 a tonne in February.Mining companies have been hedging a portion of their copper production since the start of the year, several senior bankers said.Miners cut back on hedging in recent years – and several gold miners spent billions of dollars buying back their hedges – after protests from shareholders who preferred full exposure to booming commodity markets.In addition to copper, producers had been hedging silver and aluminium, said traders.“For a while, hedging had become unfashionable. This has changed,” said François Combes, head of commodities trading at Société Générale. “You have to go back at least five years to find the last time there was genuine hedging of this scale.”The jitters in the copper market will cast a pall over the annual gathering of the copper industry in Chile, which begins on Monday. Just six months ago, the atmosphere of bullishness was overwhelming when leading metals traders and miners met for the London Metal Exchange week.Since then, confidence has been knocked by shocks including the Japanese earthquake and the jump in oil prices.Copper traders have also grown increasingly concerned about China, the world’s top consumer, where restrictions on credit have crimped demand.“There’s no question that Chinese consumption has slowed and we are seeing a build-up of stocks in many of the warehouses in the region,” said one senior metals banker. “The copper market is getting a bit tired at the moment.”The price of copper is critical to the profits of some of the world’s largest mining companies, including Freeport-McMoRan, BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Anglo American, as well as the Chilean government, which owns Codelco, the world’s largest copper miner.Bankers said the hedging in the past quarter had not had a large impact on copper prices because, rather than selling futures, the miners had been using options strategies to guarantee they would sell their metal within a certain price range.The miners typically hedged about one-quarter of their expected production to allow themselves exposure to further rises in the price.
209;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-03-30T21:00:57Z;Wall Street stocks boosted by jobs data;;Deal news helped to lift the pharmaceutical sector on Wall Street while the wider markets were buoyed by promising employment data ahead of the big monthly payroll report on Friday.Valeant, an acquisitive speciality pharmaceutical company, said it was making a $5.7bn hostile offer for Cephalon, another drugmaker.The news sent shares in Valeant up 12.8 per cent to $50.08, while Cephalon jumped 28.4 per cent to $75.44, the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 index. The $73-a-share cash proposal, which represents a 29 per cent premium to where the shares have traded over the past month, comes after Valeant tried and failed to engage Cephalon’s management and board in takeover discussions.Elsewhere in the sector Merck was up 1.6 per cent to $33.30 while Forest Laboratories rose 4.3 per cent to $32.48. The S&P healthcare index was up 0.7 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent to 1,328.26 after the ADP National Employment Report estimated that private non-farm employment had risen by 201,000 in March.The figure was broadly in line with expectations, but kept traders’ hopes alive for a strong official employment number on Friday. This was the fourth month where the ADP figure showed about 200,000 jobs being added, compared with the previous four months where the average was 74,000.“In short, there has been a clear and sustained acceleration in private payroll gains,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.The S&P 500 has bounced back 5.7 per cent in the past two weeks as traders have turned their attention to the US domestic economic recovery and away from global tensions.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the marketplace, fell 3.2 per cent in the session to 17.6, falling below 18 points for the first time since the tensions began in Middle East and north Africa in the middle of February.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,350.23 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,776.79.Financial stocks gained ground in the session, led by Visa and MasterCard, following speculation that US curbs on debit card fees will be delayed or modified.Visa was up 2.8 per cent to $74.23 while MasterCard added 0.8 per cent to $253.66 in reaction to comments from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, in the previous session that the central bank would not meet an April 21 deadline to come up with a final rule on debit card transaction fees.Jon Tester, Democratic senator, is also pushing for a chamber vote on a bill that could delay the cap by two years.Elsewhere in financials, Goldman Sachs was up 0.4 per cent to $159.07 while JPMorgan Chase added 0.9 per cent to $46.45. The S&P financial sector put on 0.7 per cent.Among telecoms, AT&T rose 2.2 per cent to $30.71 after Randall Stephenson, the chief executive officer, struck an upbeat note, saying that the company’s takeover of T-Mobile USA would boost network capacity and improve service for devices such as the iPhone. He also said that he expected some divestiture before the deal was allowed to go ahead by the regulators.Shares in AT&T are up 9.9 per cent since the $39bn deal, which would create the largest wireless carrier in the US, was announced early last week.These gains helped lift the S&P telecoms index 1.4 per cent in the session with Verizon Communications also gaining ground, up 0.4 per cent to $38.46.Among the individual stocks in focus BlackRock, the world’s largest listed investment manager by assets, gained 6.7 per cent to $198.98 on news that the company was replacing Genzyme, the biotech group, in the S&P 500 index.The stock rallied on the expectation that mutual funds and other investment vehicles that track the S&P 500 index will now buy its shares.Qihoo Technology, China’s largest provider of free antivirus software, traded on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time after an initial public offering. The stock rose 135 per cent on its opening day, to $34, more than double its IPO price of $14.50.Oxford Industries, an apparel maker, climbed 33.4 per cent to $33.37 after reporting an 18 per cent rise in its dividend and strong fourth-quarter earnings.Citrix Systems, the software maker, was up 3.1 per cent to $72.24 after Morgan Keegan & Co initiated its coverage of the stock with an “outperform” rating.
210;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-03-23T14:26:03Z;Financials weigh on Wall Street;;Bank of America lost ground after announcing that the Federal Reserve had “objected” to its planned dividend increase, while the wider markets edged lower for another day as oil prices tipped over $105 a barrel.The bank said it had submitted a plan to the Fed for a “modest increase” in its dividend for the second half of 2011 but that they had “objected to the proposed increase in capital distributions”. Shares were down 1.4 per cent to $13.68.Last Friday, financial stocks on Wall Street were given a boost following a decision by the Fed to relax the rules on banks returning cash to their shareholders. But this news left the S&P financial index down 0.7 per cent, the worst performing sector of the session.JPMorgan Chase, which itself announced a dividend last Friday, was down 1 per cent to $45.01. Elsewhere, Zions Bancorporation fell 1.2 per cent to $23.11, while Regions Financial lost 1.8 per cent to $7.17. Goldman Sachs was 1.3 per cent lower to $158.65.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent to 1,289.25, adding to the 0.4 per cent loss in the previous session, as oil prices ticked up and traders continued to try and assess the impact of the conflict in Libya and the fallout from the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.Adobe Systems, the software developer, was down 3.2 per cent to $31.83 after lowering its second-quarter revenue forecast due to the Japanese earthquake.Japan is Adobe’s second-biggest market after the US and accounts for between 10 to 15 per cent of revenue each quarter. The company also reported an 85 per cent rise in fiscal first-quarter profit.The S&P technology sector was down 0.3 per cent with semiconductor stocks losing ground in spite of assurances from analysts that the supply chain disruptions from the Japanese disaster would not sprawl.“We believe the Japan earthquake will result in only a temporary disruption to the semiconductor supply chain and stock prices,” analysts at JPMorgan said. “As a result, we maintain our constructive stance on semiconductors,” the note continued.Investors remained nervous and Applied Materials lost 1.2 per cent to $14.93, while Rubicon Technology fell 2.8 per cent to $25.80. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.6 per cent, down 1.7 per cent overall since the natural disaster in Japan.Elsewhere in the technology sector Jabil Circuit, the world’s third-largest electronics manufacturing services company, was up 8.6 per cent to $20.58 after giving a third-quarter earnings forecast that exceeded analysts’ expectations.
211;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-03-18T20:51:04Z;Financials lead Wall Street rally;;Financial stocks climbed after the Federal Reserve cleared the way for banks to raise their dividends, while in the wider markets a turbulent week on Wall Street ended on a high note due to easing geopolitical tensions.JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo were among those to raise their dividend following a decision by the Fed to relax the rules on banks returning cash to their shareholders.JPMorgan climbed 2.7 per cent to $45.74 while Wells Fargo added 1.5 per cent to $31.83. The S&P financial index rose 1.1 per cent.In the wider markets, US equities continued to rebound from the heavy losses seen earlier in the week lifted by news that Libya had announced an “immediate ceasefire” in its offensive against rebels.The S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,279.20, adding to the 1.3 per cent gains from the previous session.News that the G7 had reached an agreement to intervene in the markets to curb the rise of the yen also served to bolster sentiment.The S&P 500 is still down 1.9 per cent over the week, however, and 4.8 per cent lower since the onset of turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East in mid-February.Industrial stocks saw the strongest gains after financials, helped by the easing geo-political tensions. In the industrial sector Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, was up 1.9 per cent to $105.06, while Rockwell Automation advanced 1.2 per cent to $88. The S&P industrial index was up 0.7 per cent.Energy stocks lost some ground in the session following these developments in Libya. Schlumberger, the oilfield services giant, was down 1.3 per cent to $85.93 while Rowan Companies fell 2.6 per cent to $40.43.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 11,858.52, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,643.67. The indices were down 1.5 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively over the week.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, was down 6.5 per cent, but is still up 22 per cent over the week.In corporate news, General Mills announced that it was in negotiations to buy half of Yoplait, the yoghurt brand, sending shares in the food group up 1.4 per cent to $36.65.Elsewhere, Celera was up 34 per cent to $8.40 after Quest Diagnostics, a laboratory-testing group said it was buying the genetics group. Quest Diagnostics fell 0.8 per cent to $53.74.Nike lost ground after the company reported disappointing profits and slimmer margins due to higher commodity costs. Its shares tumbled 9.2 per cent to $77.59, a six-month low.The week on Wall Street was split into two halves. The first three days saw heavy selling as traders worried about the impact of the earthquake and resulting tsunami and potential nuclear disaster on Japan, the third-largest economy in the world.Negative news flow left the S&P 500 down 3.2 per cent in three days and caused the Vix volatility index to spike up 46.4 per cent. Thursday and Friday saw a recovery as traders decided that the sell-off had been overdone and analysts calculated that the impact on the Japanese and the world economy would not be significant.Research from RBC Capital Markets found that technical indicators such as the number of US stocks trading below their 50 day moving average and the put-to-call ratio showed that the markets were at “deep ‘oversold’ levels often associated with market rebounds”.The markets were also lifted by bumper manufacturing data from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday, the best monthly reading since 1984, and news of a ceasefire in Libya on Friday. The sectors that suffered worst in the week were those directly affected by the Japanese disaster. Nuclear stocks plunged, with Uranium Energy falling 10.5 per cent and Uranium Resources declining 6.7 per cent.Insurance companies also lost ground on worries over how much they will be forced to pay out. Aflac was 8.8 per cent lower while Platinum Underwriters lost 4.1 per cent. The KBW property casualty index slid 2 per cent over the week.Technology stocks fell on worries over component shortages as Japan is one of the world’s largest producers of semiconductors. Qualcomm fell 3.5 per cent while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 2 per cent over the week.Material and industrial stocks had a mixed week, pulled sharply lower early in the week but rebounding strongly as sentiment improved. The S&P materials index ended up flat and the industrial index fell 1.7 per cent overall.
212;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-03-17T21:50:47Z;Wall Street led by industrial gains;;Industrial and commodity stocks led a rebound on Wall Street following strong manufacturing data and a sense that the sharp sell-off in the previous session had been overdone.The S&P 500 bounced back 1.3 per cent to 1,273.72, paring some of the 2 per cent losses in the previous session, boosted by news that the Philadelphia Fed business activity index had showed its best monthly reading since January 1984.The index climbed 7.3 points in March to 43.4, far surpassing the 28.8 reading expected by economists.Also lifting sentiment was separate figures showing that weekly unemployment claims had declined by 16,000 to 385,000. “The downtrend in initial jobless claims is undeniable,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The data helped industrial stocks post some of the strongest gains in the session, recovering from some of the sharp losses earlier in the week. General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant in Japan, added 1.4 per cent to $19.22, paring back the 3.4 per cent losses seen in the previous session. The stock is down 5.6 per cent over the week, however.The S&P industrial index was up 1.6 per cent, reducing some of the 3.9 per cent losses suffered in the past five days. 3M was up 1.3 per cent to $88.69 while Honeywell was 1.6 per cent higher to $55.21 in the session.Elsewhere in the sector, FedEx saw gains after giving a strong fourth-quarter profit forecast. The package delivery company predicted a profit of $1.66 to $1.83 a share, topping the $1.66 estimated by analysts.This bright outlook overshadowed a reported 3.3 per cent fall in third-quarter profits and the shares were up 3.1 per cent to $87.89.Shares in rival UPS were up 1.8 per cent to $71.61 while Expeditors added 1.2 per cent to $47.11.Energy stocks saw the most powerful gains, however, as oil and gas prices jumped due to the turmoil in Japan and Bahrain.Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, was up 4.8 per cent to $87.06 while ConocoPhillips, the energy group, added 4 per cent to $76.72. The S&P energy sector jumped 3.1 per cent.Material stocks also saw strong gains. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, was up 3.4 per cent to $52 as copper prices rose due to subsiding global panic. Cliff Natural Resources was up 5.8 per cent to $88.60.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.4 per cent higher to 11,774.51 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,636.05 in the session.Still, strategists warned that this was not the end of the pullback in US equities and the market was still in a corrective phase. “The averages will probably work their way a bit lower in the coming weeks, but we are probably more than halfway through the corrections,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The S&P is still down 5.2 per cent since its mid-February high before the turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa. The index is down 2.3 per cent over the week, but still up 1.3 per cent since the start of the year. The previous session saw the index fall into negative territory for the year for the first time.The Vix index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was down 10.4 per cent in the session. It is up 30.8 per cent over the week and 60 per cent above mid-February lows. Elsewhere, technology stocks saw gains, rebounding from a week of sharp losses.Qualcomm, which lost 4.7 per cent in the previous session, was up 3.6 per cent to $52.32 after the mobile-phone chipmaker said it sees limited impact from the Japanese disaster.Elsewhere in the tech sector, Apple was up 1.4 per cent to $334.64 while Hewlett-Packard gained 3.2 per cent to $41.40. The S&P technology index was up 1 per cent, paring some of the 2.7 per cent fall previously in the week.In corporate news Winnebago Industries, the motor home manufacturer, reported a surprising 3.6 per cent decline in second- quarter revenue, sending the stock down 12 per cent to $13.37. The company blamed weakening consumer confidence caused by volatility in gas prices for the fall. Elsewhere Guess, the clothing retailer, gave a weak outlook both for earnings this year and for the current quarter’s results. The company also reported lower comparable sales at its larger US retail business declined. Shares were down 14 per cent to $37.71.
213;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
214;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-03-15T22:08:47Z;Wall St falls on Japan’s nuclear crisis;;"General Electric, Aflac and Halliburton were among the many stocks pulled lower as traders sold US equities on worries over the burgeoning nuclear crisis in Japan.All 10 of the S&P sectors were hit as investors turned away from risky assets following two more explosions at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and warnings from the prime minister of “substantial” radiation leaks.Industrial stocks saw some of the heaviest losses. GE, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant, was one of the worst-performing stocks on the S&P, fell 1.6 per cent to $19.61.Related stocks also lost ground. 3M lost 1.7 per cent to $89.50 while Caterpillar was 1.3 per cent lower to $100.75. The S&P industrial index dropped 1.1 per cent.Some strategists argued that the industrial sell-off was surprising given that the sector might eventually benefit from the disaster. “In the medium term, some of these suppliers are going to be turned to the rebuilding effort,” said Brett Hammond, chief investment strategist at TIAA-CREF Asset Management.Elsewhere on Wall Street, insurers faced heavy selling on fears over the mounting costs of the natural disaster in Japan. Aflac was down 5.6 per cent to $50.89, making it the worst-performing stock on the S&P index, while Platinum Underwriters lost 1.2 per cent to $36.26. The KBW property casualty index was 1.3 per cent lower.Energy stocks fell away as oil prices softened on fears that a nuclear crisis would hamper global economic growth. Halliburton an oilfield services company, was down 2.3 per cent to $44.01 while ConocoPhillips was 1.1 per cent lower to $74.98. This left the S&P energy index 0.8 per cent softer, while the S&P 500 fell 1.1 per cent to 1,281.87 at the close, a six-week low.But the losses had been far more severe earlier in the session. The S&P tanked 2.1 per cent in the minutes after opening, but then edged higher through the rest of the session.The markets were given a boost following a statement by the Federal Reserve on monetary policy. The monetary policy committee voted unanimously to keep interest rates steady, complete the current round of quantitative easing and said that the economy was on a “firmer footing”.“They came to the conclusion that there was no justification to rocking the
boat in the wake of ongoing development,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.The S&P 500 index has fallen 4.6 per cent in the past three weeks, with the feared effects of the disaster adding to concerns over oil supplies following the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East. It is still up 1.9 per cent this year.Commentators trying to weigh up the impact of the disaster generally struck a more pessimistic tone than on Monday. Analysts at Citigroup estimated that the total damage to infrastructure could be as high as Y5,000bn-Y10,000bn.However, most added that the long-term prospects for US equities were positive. The “long-term real returns from stocks remain attractive, in our opinion, when compared with other assets, such as cash or Treasury bonds,” said strategists at PNC in a note.Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.2 per cent to 11,855.42, a six-week low, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.3 per cent to 2,667.33.The Vix index, a measure of volatility, rose 13 per cent to a six-month high in a sign that traders foresee more turbulence in the pipelines.In the technology sector Apple was down 2.3 per cent to $345.43 while Yahoo fell 5.7 per cent to $16.33.Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker after Intel, tumbled 1.9 per cent to $33.90 after saying that the “substantial” damage to one of its plants in Japan from the earthquake will hurt sales in the first and second quarters.The S&P technology sector was 1.8 per cent lower with traders retreating from a sector that has climbed 35 per cent in the six months from early September.All those companies with exposure to nuclear energy were badly hit for the second consecutive session. Uranium Resources lost 9.7 per cent to $1.58, adding to the 24.7 per cent fall in the previous session.Renewable energy stocks added to gains in the previous session as traders sought to capitalise on any backlash against nuclear power. First Solar was up 8.2 per cent to $158.91 while Suntech Power was up 9.9 per cent to $9.10.MEMC Electronic Materials was down 3.1 per cent to $12.95 in the session, but the silicon maker is still up 8.1 per cent over the last two days."
215;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-03-09T03:05:38Z;Antofagasta declares special pay-out;;Chile’s Luksic family is due to receive more than $700m (£433m) this year after surging copper prices pushed Antofagasta, the mining company controlled by the family, to declare a special dividend of 100 cents.A fivefold rise in the pay-out for 2010 offered proof of the copper market’s financial impact on the mining industry. Freeport-McMoRan, the US copper miner, also declared a 100 cents special dividend for 2010 to clear excess cash.London-listed Antofagasta ended last year in a net cash position of $1.3bn after profits nearly doubled.The completion of a new mine and mine-expansion project allowed it to increase its production volumes at the time that sales prices for the industrial metal were ascending to this year’s highs of about $10,000 a tonne.Most of that cash pile will be disbursed to foundations and vehicles controlled by various members of the Luksic family.Metalinvest and Kupferberg, the company’s two largest shareholders with a combined 61 per cent, are controlled by the Luksics through the E Abaroa Foundation.Aureberg, a vehicle run by Jean-Paul Luksic, the chairman, controls an additional 4 per cent.These concerns representing 640m ordinary shares – or 65 per cent of the base – are entitled to the total 2010 dividend of $1.16 a share, comprised almost entirely of the special dividend, up from 9.4 cents in 2009.That represents $742m in gross proceeds, not counting other funds from the Luksics’ preference shares.The miner is in the middle of an expansion programme and produced 521,000 tonnes of copper last year, up from 443,000 in 2009. But production is set to rise to 715,000 tonnes in 2011, the company said.The expansion of its Las Pelambres mine finished early last year and a new mine called Esperanza entered production late in the year.For the 12 months to December 31, pre-tax profits rose 79 per cent from $1.44bn to $2.57bn. But the tax bill more than doubled to $753m, in part because of higher dividend remittances. Revenues rose from $3bn to $4.57bn and earnings per share increased from 67.7 cents to $1.06.The shares fell 38p to £13.82.● FT CommentAntofagasta is pulling ahead of Kazakhmys, its nearest peer in the London market. While Kazakhmys maintained its 300,000 ounce production level in 2009 and 2010 and reiterated it as the target for 2011, the Chilean company is targeting 715,000 ounces by 2011. That should attract new scrutiny on their widening valuation: Kazakhmys trades on 6 times forecast 2011 earnings while its Chilean peer is on 10 times.

The S&P aerospace and defence sector was up 1.6 per cent.The S&P 500 index was up 0.9 per cent at 1,321.82 as the oil price fell on news that key oil producing nations were boosting their production to make up for lost supply out of Libya.The S&P 500 is still down 1.6 per cent since its mid-February highs on fears that elevated oil prices caused by the troubles in North Africa and the Middle East could damage the domestic economic recovery.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 per cent to 12,214.46 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.7 per cent to 2,765.77.Some strategists argued that this rally for US equities would be short-lived as turmoil in the oil markets looked set to continue.“While we might have a day or two of stable or falling oil prices, the situation in North Africa and the Middle East is far from over,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “Oil prices are likely to climb higher, which in turn will put further short term pressure of equities.”Financial and industrial stocks were some of the chief beneficiaries of the upturn in risk appetite in the session.General Electric added 1.2 per cent to $20.62 while 3M put on 1.5 per cent to $93.75. The S&P industrial index was up 1.5 per cent.Financial stocks saw even sharper gains with the S&P sub-index adding 2.2 per cent. PNC Financial Services gained 4.4 per cent to $63.37 while Zions Bancorporation rose 2.9 per cent to $23.14.Bank of America added 4.7 per cent to $14.69, helped by comments from Brian Moynihan, chief executive, at the bank’s first investor day conference since 2007.Mr Moynihan said he believed the bank had the ability to earn between $35bn and $40bn a year in pre-tax earnings when the business normalises, a figure significantly higher than any earnings reported in the past 15 years.The bank lost $1.3bn in 2010 and earned $4.4bn pre-tax in 2008 and 2009. In 2007, it earned $20.9bn, in 2006 $32bn and in 2005 $24.5bn.Mr Moynihan also said that the bank had no intentions of making any more acquisitions and instead would focus on returning “every dollar” in capital to shareholders through regular dividends, share buy-backs and special cash dividends.Only the energy sector lost ground in the session due to the lower oil prices.Marathon Oil was down 2.4 per cent to $50.18 while Conocophillips, another oil company, was down 1.1 per cent to $78.32. The S&P energy sector lost 0.6 per cent, although it is still up 13 per cent over the year.In corporate news, shares in Urban Outfitters lost ground after the retailer reported fourth-quarter sales and profit that fell short of expectations.The company reported earnings per share of 45 cents, falling short of the 52 cents expected on Wall Street. Its shares tumbled 16.7 per cent to $31.66.Analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note: “[Urban Outfitters is] a great long-term growth story but we are still more guarded on the near-term, given uncompelling valuation . . . risks of higher sourcing costs, and potential difficulty navigating through fashion shifts.”Elsewhere in the retail sector, Casey’s General Stores fell 7 per cent to $37.71 after reporting third-quarter earnings of 37 cents a share, falling short of the 49 cents a share expected by Wall Street.McDonald’s reported that same-store sales had risen by 3.9 per cent worldwide in February. This was ahead of expectations but its shares were down 1 per cent to $75.55 after like-for-like sales growth in US fell short of forecasts.
217;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-03-07T22:45:07Z;Wall St gives up gains amid global uncertainty;;Shares in Starbucks ticked higher after a rating upgrade and comments from its chief executive officer about future acquisitions. But the wider markets endured another day of losses due to the ever-growing turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.Howard Schultz, Starbucks CEO, said he expected the coffee chain to make “a number of acquisitions” as part of its expansion into the single-cup, home-brewing market.“We are building and investing in resources and people to build a significant consumer products business that over time will rival the size and scale of our retail company,” Mr Schultz told the Wall Street Journal.Morgan Stanley also upgraded the coffee chain to “overweight” from “equal weight” with a $40 price target, saying it was optimistic about the company’s plans to enter the “rapidly growing $3bn global single-serve coffee market”. Shares in Starbucks were up 1.5 per cent to $33.60, one of the biggest gains on the S&P 500.Elsewhere in the sector, McDonald’s was up 0.3 per cent to $76.29. The S&P restaurant and bar index was up 0.4 per cent, one of the few sectors to rise in the session.The S&P 500 closed down 0.8 per cent to 1,310.13, adding to the 0.7 per cent loss in the previous session, as Libya lurched further towards civil war, causing oil and gold prices to spike higher for another day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7 per cent to 12,090.03 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4 per cent to 2,745.63 in the sessionThe S&P 500 index is now off 2.5 per cent from its mid-February high on fears that sustained high oil prices will hamper economic growth. “The recent surge in oil prices poses a threat to the US expansion,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley in a report.These fears over the economic recovery hit the materials sector particularly hard. Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest copper miner by market capitalisation, was down 3 per cent to $50.14 while Cliff Natural Resources was down 3.4 per cent to $95.77. The S&P materials index was 1.8 per cent lower, the worst performing sector in the session.Industrial stocks also saw sharp losses for the same reasons. Boeing, the aerospace and defence company, was 1.3 per cent lower to $70.88 while Joy Global, which manufactures mining equipment, fell 2.9 per cent to $93.82. The S&P industrial index was down 0.8 per cent.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was up 8.1 per cent. The index is now up 31.4 per cent since its mid-February lows before the markets began reacting strongly to the global political tensions.Semiconductor stocks were some of the worse performing after Wells Fargo cut its view of the sector to “market weight” from “overweight” for the first time in more than two yearsThis left the Philadelphia Semiconductor index down 3.1 per cent as Micron Technology fell 5.2 per cent to $11.03 and Nvidia lost 1.4 per cent to $20.47.The technology sector was down 1.2 per cent despite deal activity elsewhere in the sector. Western Digital, the hard drive maker, announced a deal to buy Japanese rival Hitachi’s hard disk drive business for $4.3bn in cash and stock.

218;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-02-28T21:54:38Z;Wall St rises on strong economic data;;"US stocks extended their recovery from last week’s losses, helped by strong
economic data, positive comments from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and deal activity in the healthcare real estate investment trust sector.The markets were given an early lift by comments from William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, that the outlook for the US economy was “considerably brighter”, but not bright enough for the central bank to withdraw stimulus help.Also helping sentiment was a strong number from the Chicago purchasing managers’ index, which measures the number of purchasing managers that are reporting better business conditions.Elsewhere, Ventas, the second-biggest US health-care real estate investment trust by market value, said it would acquire its rival Nationwide Health Properties in an all-stock deal valued at $5.79bn.This sent shares in Nationwide Health up 9.7 per cent to $42.74 while Ventas lost 3.1 per cent to $55.42.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher to 1,327.22, building on the 1.1 per cent rally on Friday.This followed a 2.8 per cent loss earlier last week as the unrest in north Africa and the Middle East led to concerns over the oil supply.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent to 12,226.34 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,782.27.Many traders used the recent sell-off as an opportunity to re-enter the markets. “The markets are supported by the decent economic data and so many bulls are using the recent correction as an opportunity to add to their positions,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.The rally was broad based, with all of the S&P sectors rising. The materials sector saw some of the strongest gains as global risk appetite edged higher.US Steeladded 1.3 per cent to $57.49 while Nucor rose 2.2 per cent to $47.96. The S&P materials index was up 1 per cent.Limiting the gains, however, were figures from the Commerce Department showing that consumer spending had risen by less than expected in January. Spending rose 0.2 per cent, less than the 0.5 per cent rise in December and short of the 0.4 per cent expected.However, the figures are likely to have been dented by bad weather. “Looking ahead, assuming that energy prices do not continue to spiral upward, the key determinant of consumer spending growth will be the pace of the recovery in the labour market and hence the path of wage and salary income,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Amazon fell 2.2 per cent to $173.29 after UBS downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, citing concerns that margins will be hit by the company’s new video streaming service.Amazon launched the service last week to compete with Netflix, the film subscription company.Shares in Netflix were down 2.7 per cent to $206.67 and have now fallen 6.7 per cent since last Wednesday.Humana, a health insurance company, was up 3.9 per cent to $65.01 after it was awarded a lucrative contract by the US defence department late on Friday night. The contract had been awarded to UnitedHealth Group in 2009 but Humana successfully challenged the decision.Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company controlled by Warren Buffett, added 2.8 per cent to $87.28 after Mr Buffett said he was prepared for “more major acquisitions” in his annual letter to shareholders.Looking at the month of February, the S&P 500 hasrisen 3.2 per cent, the Dow 2.8 per cent and the Nasdaq 3 per cent. The S&P has seen its third consecutive monthly gain and has risen 26.5 per cent since the start of September. On February 16 the index reached a point where it had doubled from its 2009 lows.The energy sector has been one of the strongest sectors of the month. The S&P oil and gas drilling index saw particular gains, rising 15.5 per cent in a month that has seen oil spike as high as $120 a barrel. The overall energy index was 6.8 per cent higher, up 14.6 per cent over the year. The index has now put on 52.6 per cent since the start of September.The biggest gainer on the S&P in February was JDS Uniphase, a maker of optical communications, which was up 45.4 per cent to $24.67 while Big Lots, a discount retailer, had risen 29.1 per cent to $41.03."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,130.45 while the Nasdaq Composite closed 1 per cent higher to 2,781.05, the biggest gain in three weeks. The indices lost 2.1 per cent and 1.9 per cent, respectively, over the five days.Stocks in the materials sector were prominent among those rebounding on Friday as the S&P materials index was up 1.4 per cent, recovering slightly from the 4.4 per cent loss earlier in the week.Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s biggest copper miner by market capitalisation, was up 1.1 per cent to $52.45.Financials also bounced back.

Shares in AIG retreated 4.7 per cent to $38.54.Positive consumer confidence data also helped to lift sentiment on Wall Street.The Michigan Consumer Sentiment index put on 3.3 points to 77.5, which was ahead of the 74.2 expected by economists and the highest level for three years. However, the second reading of the fourth-quarter GDP numbers came in slightly below expectation, limiting a greater market rally.The Commerce Department showed that GDP had grown by 2.8 per cent annualised in the fourth quarter, below the initial estimates of 3.2 per cent.In other earnings news, Applied Materials reported earnings of 36 cents per share in the first quarter, ahead of the 33 cents per share figure estimated by analysts. This left shares in the semiconductor equipment group up 1.8 per cent to $16.12.JC Penney, the retailer, reported fourth-quarter earnings up 36 per cent and gave a stronger-than-expected full-year earnings forecast.But this failed to impress the markets and its stock lost 6.5 per cent to $34.16.Following a national holiday on Monday, Wall Street began the trading week on Tuesday with its sharpest one-day fall on the S&P 500 in six months.Markets around the world had tumbled on Monday as violence in Libya escalated and oil supplies were disrupted, leaving Wall Street with some catching up to do. When the markets did open, the S&P 500 tumbled 2.1 per cent while the Vix index rose to a 2½-month high.Markets continued to fall on Wednesday and Thursday primarily due to the geopolitical tensions but they were not helped by weak earnings results from Walmart, Hewlett-Packard and General Motors.Walmart was down 6.6 per cent on the week to $51.75 while Hewlett-Packard lost 12.3 per cent to $42.68. General Motors declined 8.9 per cent to $33.25.Energy stocks gained throughout the week as oil prices rose to nearly $120 a barrel before easing back to $112.

The index had been at 30-month highs at the end of last week.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, rocketed up 29.8 per cent in the sharpest one day jump since May.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.4 per cent lower at 12,212.72 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.7 per cent to 2,756.42. Materials stocks saw some of the sharpest declines as the violence in Libya sucked away global risk appetite and softened commodity prices.Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest copper producer, fell 4.9 per cent to $50.38 and Cliff Natural Resources was down 4 per cent to $92.73. The S&P materials index declined 3.3 per cent.Financial stocks also saw heavy losses. Bank of America was down 3.6 per cent to $14.18 while the S&P financial index was down 3 per cent.“We have a market that is overextended and traders are looking for a catalyst to take profits,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “But it looks like the Middle East and north Africa problems will not be enough to bring about a sustained correction unless the strong US domestic economic data begin to fade,” he added.Integrated oil and gas companies saw some of the few gains in the session as the outbreak of violence in Libya caused oil prices to shoot up for the second consecutive day.Chevron rose .6 per cent to $100.32 while ExxonMobil added 1.1 per cent to $85.44. The S&P integrated oil and gas index was up 0.7 per cent.In economic data, the consumer confidence index from the Conference Board increased to 70.4 in February, a three-year high.“Looking ahead, consumers are more positive about the economy and their income prospects but feel somewhat mixed about employment conditions,” said a statement from the Conference Board.The S&P Case-Shiller home price index fell 4 per cent in the last quarter of 2010.The recent flurry of mergers and acquisitions activity continued on Wall Street with two oil refiners, Holly and Frontier Oil, announcing a merger that will create a $7bn company.

BHP said it was buying Chesapeake’s 75 per cent stake in Fayetteville shale natural gas field in Arkansas, which was put up for sale by the US gas producer two weeks ago.The sale, announced on Monday, is part of a continuing effort by Chesapeake to reduce its long-term debt by 25 per cent in 2011 to 2012 by selling assets and cutting spending.Home Depot reported that profits had risen by 71 per cent in the fourth quarter.The largest US home improvement retailer by sales posted earnings of $587m or 36 cents a share – up from $342m or 20 cents a share a year earlier.That was ahead of analysts’ estimates of 31 cents a share but the stock was still down 1 per cent to $38.08 in the session. This was ahead of the broader retail sector, however, which declined 2 per cent.Macy’s said its fourth-quarter profit had risen by 50 per cent from the previous year.The department store chain reported a profit of $667m, or $1.55 a share, up from $445m, or $1.05 a share, last year.

Murphy Oil was up 1.7 per cent to $73.88 while Chevron added 1.6 per cent to $98.72. The S&P oil and gas index was up 0.8 per cent.Material stocks gave up ground, however, on news China had raised its reserve ratio requirement by 50 basis points in a further move to combat inflation.Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s biggest copper miner by market capitalisation, was down 4.2 per cent to $52.95 while the S&P basic materials index was 2.4 per cent lower.Traders also had one eye on Europe amid concerns about Portugal’s ability to raise funds in the capital markets, ahead of this weekend’s meeting of G20 finance ministers in Paris.In earnings news, Newpark Resources, a provider of drilling fluids, reported fourth-quarter earnings of 15 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate of 10 cents, and sending the stock up 4.8 per cent to $6.81.Elsewhere in the wider energy sector, SunPower, the second-largest supplier of solar cells in the US, forecast 2011 earnings of as much as $2.20 a share, far surpassing the $1.74 cents a share estimated by analysts.

Among the leaders was Noble, the offshore driller, which was up 8.1 per cent to $42.07 while Schlumberger added 5.1 per cent to $95.04.Elsewhere, NYSE Euronext unveiled formal plans to merge with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange.NYSE was down 1.4 per cent to $37.79 on the week, however, after investors reacted negatively to the specifics of the deal which will see the German exchange own 60 per cent of the new company and have the majority of directors on the board. NYSE is still up 13 per cent since rumours of merger talks emerged.Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceutical group, finally agreed its deal with Genzyme for $20.1bn in the biggest takeover in the pharmaceutical sector since 2009.

Still, shares in Green Mountain were down 3.8 per cent to $41.81 over the week.A raft of economic data also helped to move the markets higher. The most promising piece of data was from the Philadelphia Fed showing that US manufacturing had risen strongly in February, surging unexpectedly from 19.3 in January to 35.9 in February.However, data also showed that the number of people claiming for unemployment had risen by 10,000 more than expected, to 410,000.In other data, US home construction was strong and consumer price index inflation was higher than expected. The Federal Open Market Committee revised the US gross domestic product outlook up and unemployment down.

224;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-02-08T09:33:28Z;Beware Dr Copper’s broad message of health;Supply is trailing demand, rather than demand outstripping supply;Are record copper prices the result of a supply or a demand shock?For many unsophisticated investors the question is rather academic. Whether it is supply or demand at play the result is the same: higher prices. Indeed, copper has set a string of price records recently, last week breaking above the $10,000 a tonne mark.But as investors buy commodities as a proxy to benefit from stronger economic growth in emerging countries, particularly China, the question is important. Indeed, the red metal’s sensitivity to the strength of global economic growth has earned it the nickname Dr Copper – as if it had a PhD in economics.As prices surge above $10,000 a tonne, many investors believe that Dr Copper is signalling strong economic growth. Investors take the copper rally as a sign that China and the rest of the emerging markets are doing well, so they buy other risky assets. And true, rising prices reflect, at least in part, rising consumption for the metal.But in reality, Dr Copper is telling the world that supplies are lagging. Even if global economic growth was modest, copper prices would be high, as we saw in late 2009 and early 2010. The production problems were highlighted by Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the world’s largest listed copper miner, which said last month that output of copper had fallen by almost 5 per cent in 2010.Xstrata, the Anglo-Swiss mining company that is one of the world’s five top copper producers, highlighted the supply problems on Tuesday, saying that the “development of new copper projects remains challenging due to skilled labour and engineering shortages, more onerous environmental and planning regulatory requirements, community dissent or increased political risk.”The miner, releasing its annual results, added: “Challenging conditions in the geographies in which a large proportion of new copper projects are located are likely only to exacerbate this trend.”Investors should take the message home. At $10,000 a tonne, Dr Copper is signalling an imbalance between supply and demand. But the imbalance is due to mining supply struggling to meet global demand for copper, rather than vice versa. For some, it matters little. The result is the same: record prices. But investors should not take a broader message into rising prices. Dr Copper is speaking about its own health, not about the global economy.

Oilwell Varco gained 1.7 per cent to $77.71, also helped by high energy prices as oil continued to hover around $100 a barrel.In a slightly smaller deal, Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn.This sent shares in Danaher up 2.2 per cent to $49.03, while Beckman Coulter rose 10 per cent to $82.65.Danaher will pay $83.50 a share in a tender offer for Beckman’s shares, an 11
per cent premium on Beckman’s closing price on
Friday and 45 per cent above the company’s stock price before rumours of the deal surfaced in early December.The mergers and acquisitions activity helped the S&P 500 close 0.6 per cent higher to 1,319.05.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent to 2,783.99 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 12,161.63.Sentiment in the markets continued to rise following strong economic data and earnings results last week that pushed the S&P
and the Dow indices up above the 1,300 and 12,000 levels respectively for the first time since 2008.“US markets experienced some encouraging economic data in the form of ISM non-manufacturing services, ADP employment and initial jobless claims,” said David Buik, of BGC Partners.“Plus [there was] better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from the likes of ExxonMobil, Pfizer, Marathon Oil, Time Warner, Visa, Dow Chemical,
Kellogg, MasterCard and Viacom.“Not even Friday’s employment data, badly affected by the snow, failed to quell enthusiasm,” he added.Financial stocks saw some of the strongest gains in the session, led by CNA Financial, a commercial insurer, which rose 8.8 per cent to $30.19 after posting earnings up 23 per cent and reinstating its dividend.Bank of America added 2.7 per cent to $14.67 while American Express gained 2.3 per cent to $44.82. American International Group, the insurer, was up 5.4 per cent to $42.18. The S&P financials index advanced 1.5 per cent to 226.93.Materials stocks rose in the session as copper, considered a bellwether of economic activity because of its industrial and construction use, hit a record above $10,100 a tonne.Alcoa, the world’s largest producer of aluminium, gained 1.1 per cent to $17.32 while the S&P materials index added 0.5 per cent to 247.57.In other deal news, AOL lost ground after announcing it was buying theHuffington Post, the news website, for $315m. AOL has recently been building a network of specialist websites including TechCrunch, Endgadget and Patch,
but this is the biggest acquisition yet. Its shares were down 3.4 per cent to $21.19.Under the terms of the deal, Arianna Huffington, who founded the website, will run a new AOL division that will integrate all AOL and Huffington Post
content.Investors were also awaiting the announcement of a takeover of Genzyme, the US pharmaceuticals company, by its French competitor Sanofi-Aventis.The two parties held talks at the weekend but as yet no announcement has been made.According to reports in the Financial Times, the two parties are in the process of finalising the terms of a modest cash increase to Sanofi-Aventis’ proposed $69-a-share bid. Genzyme shares gained 0.8 per cent to $74.02.Chesapeake Energy ad-vanced 4 per cent to $31.27 after the company said it would sell natural gas concerns and two energy companies for about $5bn."
226;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-02-03T20:50:08Z;Red-hot copper hits $10,000 high;;Copper prices hit $10,000 a tonne on Thursday for the first time as investors piled into the metal amid fears of a severe supply shortfall.The metal, which is widely used in manufacturing and construction, is crucial to the global economy.It has risen almost 35 per cent over the past year, buoyed by robust demand and disappointing growth in mine output.Companies such as Electrolux, the world’s second largest home appliances maker, have announced retail price increases of up to 10 per cent to cope with metals inflation.Analysts and traders believe that copper prices could surge to as much as $12,000 a tonne depending of the size of this year’s market deficit.Barclays Capital on Thursday said that the shortage would hit 822,000 tonnes in 2011, double the deficit of 2010 and a sharp turnround from a surplus of 456,000 tonnes two years ago. “The supply outlook for copper is one of anaemic mine growth,” the bank said.The production problems were highlighted by Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the world’s largest listed copper miner, which said last month that output of copper fell in 2010 by almost 5 per cent year on year.On Thursday, copper for delivery in three months’ time on the London Metal Exchange rose to an intraday high of $10,000 a tonne. The metal later traded down 0.2 per cent to $9,940 a tonne on some light profit-taking.The jump in prices was helped by fears that cyclone Yasi, which hit the state of Queensland in Australia, could disrupt some copper production. However, companies said mine sites were operating as normal late on Thursday.David Wilson, metal analyst at Société Générale in London, said hedge funds were betting that China would buy significant copper tonnage after the end of the lunar new year. “The bet is that there will be strong demand from China soon,” Mr Wilson said. But so far there were no signs of Chinese buying and copper prices in Shanghai remained below those of London, he noted.The physical trading community expects Beijing to return to the market soon, but executives and analysts are divided about the extent of the purchases.Copper bears believe that, with prices at about $10,000 a tonne, Chinese companies will run down their inventory levels in 2011.Copper bulls believe the country’s stocks are not high enough and China will need to continue to import, albeit at lower levels than last year, supporting prices.Bulls and bears largely agree that consumption levels in Europe are strong in spite of higher unemployment.At the same time, they said that US copper consumption was bouncing back from the lows of the financial crisis.As copper prices hit a record, other metals surged. Tin hit an all-time high of $30,920 a tonne, extending its rally since January 2010 to more than 80 per cent on the back of lower production in Indonesia, the world’s largest exporter.
227;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-02-03T10:40:56Z;Copper hits record $10,000 a tonne;;Copper prices hit $10,000-a-tonne psychological level for the first time as business activity measures indicated global growth was accelerating beyond expectations.Service sector data from purchasing managers in the UK and eurozone presented further evidence that growth was picking up. This followed a similar picture from manufacturing sector data earlier in the week.The red metal’s sensitivity to the strength of the global economy has earned it the nickname Dr Copper. Its rise through the landmark level is seen by many as evidence that fears of a double-dip recession are overdone.Meanwhile, on Tuesday leading miners reported lower-than-expected production levels for the metal and traders bet that strong economic growth would push up demand.Copper for delivery in three months at the London Metal Exchange rose to a record high of $10,000 on Thursday, up from the previous day’s close of $9,945.In spite of record prices, Michael Widmer, metals analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London, said copper was “a buy” and forecast an average price this year of $11,250 a tonne.“Underlying fundamentals on the copper market remain healthy,” he said.The red metal is benefiting from strong demand globally but the main driver continues to be disappointing supply, with forecasts of a growing shortage this year and in 2012 suggesting a further drawdown of inventories.The collective output of the top four listed copper miners – Freeport-McMoRan, BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Rio Tinto – dropped 12 per cent in the first half of 2010 from a year earlier. The preliminary data for the second half of the year have also disappointed as companies struggle with older and more costly mines.China could derail the rally, however.Physical traders said Chinese companies were not buying at current prices and were maintaining that they would not return to the market for some time.China is the world’s largest importer of copper and the swings in trading of the metal have a large impact on prices in the two top copper markets, Shanghai and London.However, copper bulls point to the strength of consumption in the US and, to a lesser extent, Europe. “Although China has, during the past few years, been the main copper demand driver, it is worth noting that the world excluding China still accounts for roughly 60 per cent of total consumption,” said Mr Widmer.
228;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-01-20T19:59:36Z;Freeport-McMoRan profits up on copper demand;;The accelerating bull market in copper, which is facing a stagnant supply base amid rising demand, lifted pre-tax profits at Freeport-McMoRan 46 per cent to a record $8.5bn last year.US-based Freeport, the largest publicly traded producer of the red metal, offered the first indication on Thursday of the financial bonanza that the big copper miners were enjoying. The New York-listed company published its annual results ahead of Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Xstrata, other copper miners expected to unveil similar windfalls from copper.Freeport’s earnings per share rose 56 per cent from $5.86 last year to $9.14 in the year to December. The company closed 2010 by declaring a $1 per share special dividend that cleared $472m of excess cash from its books.Copper production slid from 3.35bn pounds in 2009 to 3.14bn pounds last year, continuing long-term stagnation that has hit the industry. Rio this week revealed it mined 16 per cent less copper year in 2010 versus the previous year.The quality of copper ore in the industry’s “mega-mines” is declining. Big new copper mines are set to start producing in 2013, but analysts say these new mines may not be able to balance an undersupplied market, which feels the pull of demand from Asia.“We expect the copper bull run to continue through 2011 with further big increases in prices, which we expect to reach new record highs,” said Gayle Berry, base metals analyst at Barclays Capital in London.“This is because of the extreme mismatch between supply and demand, the impact of which will see inventories fall to a record low.” Freeport expects higher production this year, forecasting copper sales of 3.85bn pounds compared with 3.14bn last year.Production from Tenke Fungarume, the company’s new mega-mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is helping to offset lower production at Grasberg, its ageing star mine in Indonesia. The copper price on Wednesday touched an all-time high above $9,700 per tonne.Freeport, also one of the world’s biggest gold producers, owed much of its profits to similarly elevated prices of gold. It sold 1.9m ounces of gold last year, a decline from 2.6m ounces in 2009.The share price, which has gained 33 per cent over the past year, was hit by 2011 production guidance that in both copper and gold was marginally lower than prior guidance. Shares were down more than 4 per cent at $109 per share in midday New York trading.Revenues rose from $15bn to $19bn, while net profits attributable to shareholders rose 67 per cent to $4.3bn.
229;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-01-05T22:18:01Z;US stocks lifted by jobs report;;"A surprisingly positive jobs report and data showing that service industries expanded at their fastest pace since 2006 helped US stocks edge higher.Private sector employment in the ADP report increased by 297,000 in December for the biggest monthly gain in jobs since 2001, coming in far above the average estimate of 100,000 extra jobs.“There is almost no reason to quibble with today’s ADP report. This is unquestionably a positive for the economy, the labour market, income growth and risk assets,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “[But] it should be pointed out that December always has seasonal quirks for a host of estimates and, while ADP suggests that there is no real reason to dispute this number, we doubt such strength will be repeated.”The Institute of Supply Management’s reading on the services industries improved in December to its highest level since May 2006.Financials and consumer discretionary stocks led the risers after the improving economic data boosted confidence in the recovery.The financial sector gained 1.2 per cent with AIG jumping 7.3 per cent to $60.93 after the insurer said that it had received offers of up to $3bn for Nan Shan Life Insurance, its Taiwanese unit. Wells Fargo added 2.3 per cent to $32.14 while JPMorgan rose 1.2 per cent to $44.70.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index rose 0.8 per cent with online travel agencies leading the gainers. Priceline.com added 5.9 per cent to $433.60 while Expedia increased 4.1 per cent to $25.43.The S&P 500 closed up 0.5 per cent to 1,276.56, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3 per cent higher at 11,722.89 while the Nasdaq Composite had added 0.8 per cent to close at 2,702.20.Atheros Communications added 1.5 per cent to $44.64 after soaring 19 per cent in late trade on Tuesday on deal speculation. On Wednesday it agreed to be bought by Qualcomm for about $3.2bn in cash, or $45 a share.In the latest in a series of deals in the technology sector, Qualcomm is aiming to compete more effectively in the market for tablet computers by using Atheros’s expertise in wireless technology. Shares in Qualcomm added 2.1 per cent to $52.03.Elsewhere in technology, Youku, the Chinese online video website that listed in the US to much fanfare at the end of last year, climbed 6.5 per cent to $37.95 after the company said that it was working with a “major” Hollywood studio to provide an on-
demand paid video service.Falling commodity prices weighed heavily on energy and materials stocks in early trading but the sectors had pared their losses by midday.The S&P 500 energy index edged higher by 0.2 per cent while the materials sector closed flat.ExxonMobil fell 0.3 per cent to $74.70 and Conoco-Phillips was down 0.5 per cent at $67.55.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold declined by 0.3 per cent to $118.35 while Southern Copper Corporation lost 0.7 per cent to $48.60.Elsewhere in materials, Alcoa, which has risen in recent days on the back of analyst recommendations, spent much of the day in negative territory before closing up 0.2 per cent at $16.56. Brian Yu, an analyst at Citigroup, cut the aluminium producer’s rating from “buy” to “hold”.Rising demand for fertiliser helped Mosaic beat earnings expectations in its second quarter. Farmers are buying more fertiliser as they seek to make the most of corn and soyabean prices that are at multi-year highs.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets kept their “outperform” rating on the stock. “Interestingly, the stronger-than-expected performance was largely attributable to the phosphate business,” they said. “Consistent with Mosaic’s third-quarter 2011 guidance, we expect to see improving results from the potash business that could provide additional momentum for Mosaic’s stock.”Majority-owned by Cargill, the agribusiness group, Mosaic earned $1.01 per share, excluding the sale of its stake in a Brazilian fertiliser producer, up from 24 cents a share in the same quarter the year before. Shares in Mosaic gained 2.8 per cent to $77.09."
230;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2011-01-04T21:48:54Z;Motorola split marked with S&P’s biggest rise;;"Newly formed Motorola Mobility soared while the S&P 500 edged lower, dragged down by falling commodity prices.In the first day of trading after Motorola was split in two, both the handset-focused Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions, which makes networking systems, rallied.Mobility jumped 9.5 per cent to $33.12, which was the biggest gain on the
S&P 500.Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at Credit Suisse, gave the stock an “outperform” rating, saying that he expected smartphones to lead a recovery and the launch of Mobility’s first tablet device in early 2011 to add to earnings per share. He also said the company’s excess cash should not be ignored.But Ron Hall, an analyst at JPMorgan, rated Mobility “underweight”, citing concerns about smartphone and tablet competition, especially as Verizon starts to offer the iPhone. “We estimate that over 50 per cent of Motorola Mobility’s smartphone units sales could come from Verizon,” he said.“We believe the loss of around 4m smartphone units in 2011 would decrease our earnings per share forecast by around 55 per cent and that a larger share loss is possible given the continuing dominant position of Apple’s iPhone in the market.“In a worst-case scenario, we believe Verizon share loss could cause Motorola Mobility to fail to break even for full year 2011,”
he said.Mobility’s rivals edged higher with shares in Apple, which hit another all-time high on Monday, gaining 0.5 per cent to $331.21. US-listed shares in Research in Motion nudged up 0.3 per cent to $59.10.Analysts at JPMorgan were more positive about the prospects for Motorola Systems, initiating coverage with a “neutral” rating and a $38 price target.They said that, while the company’s enterprise assets were growing fast, investors should be more cautious about the government
division, where demand could be hit by tightening budgets.Shares in Motorola Solutions spent much of the session edging just slightly higher before a last-minute spurt to gain 6.6 per cent to $39.77 by the closing bell.The wider markets were mixed after Monday’s rally. The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,270.18, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.2 per cent up at 11,691.18 while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4 per cent to close at 2,681.25.Energy stocks lost steam as oil fell back below $90. The S&P 500 energy index led the fallers, down 0.6 per cent with Halliburton losing 2.9 per cent to $39.55.The S&P 500 materials index was also lower, losing 0.5 per cent, as commodity prices fell on Tuesday. Precious metals miners suffered particularly as silver and gold sold off.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gave up 0.7 per cent to $118.75 while Newmont Mining declined by 3.3 per cent to $59.08.But there were some bright spots in materials. Alcoa, the aluminium producer that rose on Monday after positive analyst comments, advanced further after it was chosen as 2011’s “top stock” by CNBC’s Jim Cramer, who said it could reach $22. Shares in Alcoa gained 4.6 per cent to $16.52.Elsewhere in materials, Molycorp rallied 7.3 per cent to $61.69 after the owner of the world’s largest rare earth deposit outside China said it might double planned production.Rare earth stocks have risen in recent weeks after China cut its export quotas for the elements used in technical devices.Molycorp has soared 26.8 per cent in the past five days with rival Rare Element Resources rocketing 68.9 per cent over the week.General Motors also benefited from increased demand in China with car sales to the country jumping 28.8 per cent in 2010. Its shares added 2.3 per cent to $37.90. Monthly car sales numbers showed that General Motors also expanded in the US in December with car sales rising by 7.5 per cent. Rival Ford put on 0.8 per cent to $17.38.In deals news, Atheros Communications soared 18.85 per cent in late trading to $44 after it was reported that Qualcomm could be interested in making a bid for the semiconductor manufacturer. The deal would be worth about $3.5bn or $45 per share, about a 22 per cent premium to the share price before the report.If it goes ahead, the acquisition would be Qualcomm's largest ever and the latest in a series of deals in the technology sector.Investors were unsurprised by the minutes from the December meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, and shrugged off a larger than expected rise
in US factory orders for November."
231;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-12-15T20:10:55Z;Africa: Treasure amid turmoil;Congo’s bountiful deposits are growing in investor allure;Adolph Lundin, a silver-haired mining magnate from Sweden, swept into the foyer of Kinshasa’s Grand Hotel to announce the “rebirth” of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s mining industry. It was 1996 and he had just secured rights to one of the richest copper and cobalt deposits in the world.The circumstances, however, were less than auspicious. Corroded cranes and flooded craters were all that remained of ventures past. A rebellion fomented by neighbouring Rwanda had consumed half of the country (then called Zaire) and Mobutu Sese Seko, its dictator, was dying of cancer. No matter, Lundin maintained: “Taking risks too much into account is like competing in a marathon with a broken leg.”Dozens of would-be Lundins have flown to Congo in years since, drawn to one of the world’s most prospective mining frontiers during a global commodities boom. In their latest incarnation they are Chinese, South Korean, Brazilian and Indian. In the wings are even Egyptian financiers, hitherto wary of putting money south of the Sahara.Demand from emerging powers has driven copper prices to record highs and put a floor under the price of many other natural resources that Africa has in abundance. It is a rare moment when the market is providing an opportunity for the continent to prosper on more equal terms.“Africa is rich and its stock is rising. The value of its land and minerals is going up,” Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary-general, said this year as he launched a review of the continent’s progress in meeting development goals. “There is no lack of resources, no deficiency of knowledge and no shortage of plans.”Congo ought to be in prime position to benefit. Mining analysts believe it could be to global metal supplies in the 21st century what Klondike in Yukon, Canada was to gold and Kimberley in South Africa was to diamonds in the 19th.Economists already base long-term copper prices on how fast Congo can develop its endowment. It has one-third of the world’s supplies of cobalt, Africa’s largest supplies of industrial diamonds and tin, as well as coltan, gold, iron ore and uranium in abundance. To boot, the Congo river, second in volume after the Amazon, could provide hydroelectric power to metal processing plants and at the same time light up much of Africa.“Congo has many of the attributes that Brazil had when it began to take off. They should bust it wide open,” says Aly-Khan Satchu, a Nairobi-based investment banker and a torchbearer for recent Afro-optimism.Congo, however, is where the promise of Africa’s emergence from the fringes of the global economy runs up against the harsh realities of a failing state, and where the most grandiose of commercial designs are stalled by the short-term agendas of officials on the take. It is also where the dark side of globalisation – criminal networks linking illegal mines to world supplies – is making much of the running.Reviving the formal mining industry, as Lundin might be forced to admit were he still alive, is indeed proving a marathon, with companies hobbled by the effect of corruption, instability and contractual disputes on share prices and insurance premiums. The most high-profile of these had Britain’s Tullow Oil stripped of claims to two oil concessions in June and Canada’s First Quantum pushed off three copper and cobalt assets where it had invested $1bn.During the 1998-2003 war, mining houses had snapped up assets in opaque circumstances. President Joseph Kabila, who came to power in 2001, had good cause to revisit some 60 such deals, agreed when the government was at its weakest. Yet if Kinshasa had moral high ground, this was steadily ceded during a protracted contract review between 2006 and 2009 in which companies were obliged to negotiate under the table as well as across it.Freeport McMoran, the world’s largest listed copper miner, recently resolved a long-running battle with Kinshasa over its terms at Tenke Fungurume– the concession in which it bought a majority share from Lundin in 2005. This raises prospects for a private US venture that in ambition rivals a $6bn Chinese mines-for-infrastructure deal. Congo watchers suspect it is the same mine alluded to in diplomatic cables leaked last week by WikiLeaks on a list of facilities around the world that are regarded as vital to the US national interest.Several gold companies, including AngloGold Ashanti and Randgold, have announced they will soon begin gold production. But the news has otherwise been less promising. Tullow is pursuing legal and other options in a bid to win back a participation in oil blocks now claimed by companies owned by Khulubuse Zuma, the nephew of South African president Jacob Zuma. First Quantum’s concessions are subject to international arbitration. One of them has already been sold on via a shell company owned by Dan Gertler, an Israeli tycoon close to Mr Kabila, to Eurasia National Resources, a FTSE 100-listed company majority backed by Kazakh oligarchs.While the sale has prompted discomfort in the City of London, the censure is falling on Congo. Foreign donors have begun withholding development aid and risk perceptions among investors have risen to “maximum”, according to Barclays Capital. “In Latin America [our stock price] would be at £10. Instead we are at a quarter of that because of insecurity of contracts,” says an official with another multinational in Congo.…Even though tens of billions of dollars of putative investment hovers near Congo’s door, only a small portion is venturing beyond. With a few exceptions, “the big western companies have been put off but the small companies that the government prefers to deal with do not have the ability to raise sufficient finance”, says a senior western official.Instead, the vast country at Africa’s heart remains trapped near the bottom of world development rankings, its budget barely twice that of neighbouring Rwanda, although its land mass is 90 times larger. It is a paradox familiar to other mineral-rich nations consumed by the battle to control resources before they have become productive. That paradox is magnified by the scale of Congo’s assets, the size of the territory – equal to western Europe – and the absence of functioning state institutions within it.After a decade of conflict, and three before that of predatory dictatorship, the Congolese in their majority are destitute. Militia violence ravages the volatile east. More than 1m artisanal miners work in conditions Dante might have conjured up, supplying the local and global trading networks that fuel the conflict. The minerals end up as components in mobile phones and other gadgets sold on western high streets. But scarcely any revenues reach the state. An inquiry by Congo’s senate found the treasury lost more than $450m in 2008 through tax evasion, smuggling and fraud.The plunder is redolent of a history stretching back to the days when King Leopold of Belgium took possession of Congo and ran it as his own estate, says Kabele Kabili, a Kinshasa-based sociology professor.To arrest the rot required a confluence of events. These seemed to be falling into place when Mr Kabila won elections in 2006, legitimising the power he inherited when his father Laurent was assassinated in 2001. The younger Kabila set about ending the wars and thawing relations with hostile neighbours. In return, foreign donors relaxed their lending rules.In the bigger cities there are signs of a pick-up. One measure is in the increased number of cars imported to the capital – from 400 in 2000 when conflict was raging to 14,000 last year. Construction is taking off, too, financed partly by remittances. The impression of a turnround, however, is deceptive. What exists of the formal economy is stifled by a panoply of Kafkaesque state agencies. Businesspeople chose between devoting resources to compliance or spending less with bribes.“At the moment, corruption is the largest chunk of the economy. All this dirty money improves the purchasing power of a chunk of the population. In the cities it does flow back into genuine business, as people buy food, clothes, medicines, cars and [mobile phone] airtime,” says a Kinshasa businessman. “But it is an economy run on consumption. To grow further and faster, we have to start playing by the rules.”…For now, the government lacks the means to enforce these rules, caught as it is in a bind familiar to other failing states. Without an effective army, police force or public administration, decriminalising the economy is a daunting task. Like so many termites, ragtag militias, the national army, politicians drawn to rent-seeking and civil servants living off the population eat away at the resources of the state.“There are rogue states, and there is the absence of state filled by rogues. Congo falls into the latter category,” says a long-term US observer of the country.Nor does multilateral development aid appear to be providing the catalyst for change. Congo is trapped in what Prof Kabili describes as a “permanent state of structural adjustment”, referring to the fiscal straitjacket imposed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund on indebted African countries from the 1980s as a condition for bail-outs. Under donor tutelage, state finances have been partly sanitised, but most economic activity takes place outside formal state control.“The stabilisation of the economy is one thing, but so long as there is no infrastructure we can’t get started,” says Mabi Malumba, economist and former finance minister.Encouraging private investment would seem one obvious path to a more virtuous circle. But facing a tough and in all likelihood expensive election next year, the Kabila government has found it expedient to deploy older methods, falling back on patronage to maintain a grip, extortion to extract revenue from mines, and the presidential guard to suppress dissent.“In a country where you don’t have an army and you don’t have an administration, you hold it together with threats and with money,” says the Kinshasa businessman.Public attitudes to multinationals are less than sympathetic, informed by a history of western perfidy in Congo and the perception that it is in western interests to keep the country broken so its riches can be plundered on the cheap. Yet for all the obstacles, mining groups keep coming. “If you want to hunt elephants you have to go to elephant country,” Mark Bristow, the chief executive of Jersey-based Randgold, said recently, echoing the late Lundin’s derring-do.It is partly this preponderance of willing takers that has inspired the belief in Kinshasa that companies will pay up, regardless of the risks.
232;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-12-10T23:38:38Z;Equity X factor often spells exasperation;X doesn't often mark the spot;Investors should be wary when companies show more flair for marketing their shares than their products. In his 1989 bestseller One Up on Wall Street, investing legend Peter Lynch warns that “a flashy name in a mediocre company attracts investors and gives them a false sense of security”, and he specifically cautions against buying stocks that have an x in their name.Though I am inclined to give a man who generated average annual returns of 29 per cent for Magellan, the world’s largest mutual fund, the benefit of the doubt, Mr Lynch’s acolytes have no way of knowing whether his warning was the investing equivalent of an old wives’ tale. Until now, that is.There are 109 stocks in the Wilshire 5000 index, among the broadest measures of US equities, that either begin or end with an x, and a few that do both. One obvious measure of how speculative such “x stocks” are is their price-to-earnings ratios but, in the first hint that Mr Lynch was on to something, only 49 of them made a profit in the past year. A way around this is to aggregate the market value and net earnings of the entire group. The results are not pretty. “X Inc” trades at a steep 29 times trailing earnings versus 18 for the entire index. On price-to- book, a measure that cannot be negative, the average “x stock” trades at 4.9 times, nearly, more than double the index. They are also twice as volatile on average.Unsurprisingly, the list is packed with futuristic-sounding names like GigOptix, Cytrix, Keryx Biopharma, Affymetrix and Oncogenex that offer technological promise but scant profits. Some that are profitable like Netflix must keep growing rapidly to justify current multiples. Partially making up for this are some large, profitable companies in the relatively dowdy logistics and retail industries such as FedEx, CSX and TJX. And then there are those like Idexx and Xilinx that break the stereotype by adding a gratuitous second x while sporting pedestrian valuations. The company that blazed the trail for double-x stocks was Xerox, a blue-chip that appreciated by 5,000 per cent during the 1960s after changing its name from Haloid. Inventing the photocopier probably helped too.Still, an x can often spell even worse trouble than a frothy valuation. A disproportionate number of “x stocks” have been embroiled in scandal, with Canada’s Bre-X being perhaps the largest. The company was on the verge of being bought by Freeport-McMoRan after supposedly discovering the world’s largest gold mine in Indonesia. When it emerged that ore samples had been infused with jewellery shavings, Bre-X’s lead geologist became the fall guy – literally – plunging to his death from a company helicopter.Another “x stock,” the futuristic-sounding YBM Magnex, lured investors with purportedly surging industrial magnet sales. After being valued at $1bn in 1998, it was exposed as a money-laundering front for Russia’s leading mafia kingpin.Weirdest of all was Solv-Ex. The company, which claimed to have developed a novel way to extract Canadian oil sands, so impressed British fund manager Peter Young that he set up unauthorised offshore accounts to magnify his exposure to the firm. When it emerged that its plant and technology were a sham, it cost his employer Morgan Grenfell an estimated £400m. Mr Young became a tabloid sensation by coming to court in a dress, pleading insanity.One does not have to be a Scrabble star to grasp how rare the letter x is in the English language – Samuel Morse did so when developing his code – so modern-day telegraph operators would surely notice that listed companies with an x in their name show up about 17 times more than common words.Lynch retired a decade before the dotcom bubble burst. It would have been interesting to see how he steered the billions at his disposal when confronted with glamour stocks such as Pets.com. Retiring in the prime of his career, he avoided the dilemma of ignoring his instincts or facing outflows to rivals claiming he “just didn’t get it”. His seemingly throwaway comment about x stocks is yet more evidence that he most certainly did.

Community Health Systems offered to buy Tenet for $3.3bn, or $6 per share in cash and stock.But Tenet rejected the bid, at about a 40 per cent premium over Thursday’s closing price, as “not remotely fair value”.Shares in Community Health Systems, which has made eight acquisitions in the past two years, making it the largest publicly traded US hospital company, also soared, up 13.4 per cent to $35.89.Other healthcare stocks were lifted by the bid. Carefusion added 2 per cent to $24.19 Thermo Fisher rose 1.9 per cent to $53.04 and Boston Scientific gained 3.5 per cent to $7.11.Positive US economic data helped the wider indices edge up but they struggled to get past their two-year high.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 1,240.26, and higher by 1.2 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 11,410.32, up 0.1 per cent over the five days.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent higher at 2,637.54, climbing 1.8 per cent on the week.The US trade deficit contracted more than forecast in October as a weaker dollar and growing overseas economies helped exports hit a two-year high.A separate release showed US consumer sentiment increased more than forecast, to its highest level in six months. But it did not significantly move the consumer discretionary index, which was up just 0.3 per cent.Record commodities imports in China lifted shares in metal producers. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold added 2 per cent to $112.87 and iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources gained 3.3 per cent to $74.33.Industrials led the risers, climbing 1 per cent as both General Electric and Honeywell joined the ranks of companies returning more money to shareholders.General Electric jumped 3.4 per cent to $17.72 after it raised its dividend for the second time this year, making a total increase of 37 per cent this year. Honeywell added 1.3 per cent to $51.98 after it hiked its dividend by 10 per cent.United Technologies also rose, up 1 per cent to $78.40, after it said late on Thursday that it expected profit to rise between 7 and 14 per cent next year.The S&P 500 financials index climbed 3.6 per cent over the week with regional bank stocks surging 7.4 per cent.Analysts at JPMorgan said the rally in regional bank stocks had been sparked by the steepening of the yield curve in US Treasuries. “In our view, this response in valuations is justified given that a steeper yield curve should support net interest income growth as cash and securities are potentially invested at higher rates,” they said. “The steeper curve also points to [a] growing probability of rising short-term rates, which is a potentially powerful catalyst for core-deposit-funded institutions.”This week also saw the best first day of trading for an IPO in three years. Chinese video streaming company Youku soared 146.5 per cent when it debuted on Wednesday but dropped 12.2 per cent to $37.50 on Friday.Borders Group sunk 12.4 per cent to $1.20 after the bookstore chain said that, if talks to refinance failed, it could end up in violation of its credit agreements in the first quarter.Shares in the retailer had gained earlier in the week after Pershing Square Capital Management, William Ackman’s hedge fund, offered to finance a potential bid by Borders for rival Barnes & Noble. Shares in Barnes & Noble edged down 0.7 per cent to $15.08.
234;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-12-09T21:28:56Z;Shareholders focus on miners’ cash;;The biggest UK-listed mining companies are about to face an embarrassment of riches. Just a short time ago the sector became notorious for slashing or suspending dividends and tapping shareholders for funds through rights issues. Now the blue-chip miners can look forward to amassing a fortune over the next couple of years.Commodity prices have rebounded strongly since their collapse in late 2008, with the result that miners can expect bumper profits allowing them to rebuild their balance sheets and still have money to spare. Investors express interest in share buy-backs or special dividends. Executives, however, sound more enthusiastic talking about multi-billion-dollar organic growth programmes.“The sheer scale of the cash generation is such that there is enough for capital expenditure and for cash returns to shareholders,” says Ephrem Ravi, analyst at Morgan Stanley.“But it’s clear that cash return is in third place behind capex and value-accretive M&A so far as the miners are concerned.”Mining executives say investors understand that miners are not straightforward dividend stocks in the way that tobacco companies are. The exposure to commodity price volatility, even among more diversified groups, makes it reasonable to move ordinary dividend payments up in small steps to lessen the risk of an abrupt change of direction during a downturn.The corollary is that shareholders have come to expect extra cash pay-outs when times are good.As René Médori, finance director at Anglo American, puts it: “In terms of dividends, we intend to maintain a progressive policy, which takes into account the earnings potential, investment needs and resultant cash flows of the group. We may also consider other means of cash distribution from time to time.”Miners believe shareholders accept the case for investing in growth because they realise the groups have to replace the materials dug out of the ground.“Our investors know that mining companies can’t just stand still, they have to consider the long-term sustainability of their business as a priority,” says Thras Moraitis, general manager of group strategy at Xstrata. “About 60 per cent of our organic growth is on brownfield sites, expanding existing assets. This is lower risk than greenfield development because we already know about operating in the location, so the returns are higher.”Yet agreement that this capital-intensive industry requires investment does not mean investors and miners are at one on what to do with all the cash.“Investors are looking to replace the dividends they would normally expect from BP,” says one executive. “We’re not going to do that.”Meanwhile companies still seem more intent than their investors on pursuing deals. After BHP Billiton failed in its $39bn (£25bn) bid for PotashCorp last month, one shareholder sounded almost relieved. “BHP going to Potash raised the spectre that the industry was going to get geared up again and start buying each other. But buy-backs are better for the stock than acquisitions.”The key point for shareholders on organic growth is how much the companies can spend wisely. The sight of all the majors, even Xstrata with its past as an acquisition machine, focusing on building new mines and expanding old ones raises the question whether the sector is reliving its past. Then it over-invested at the top of the cycle and spent years working off the debts incurred.According to Charles Kernot, analyst at Evolution: “The risk is that companies commit to new mines when they have cash at the top of the cycle but because of the delay between that commitment and first metal being extracted, the mine comes on stream in a much weaker economic environment.”This time around the industry is pinning its faith on the theory that we are experiencing a “supercycle” and commodities supply will not meet demand. This proved spectacularly wrong during the financial crisis. But now the combination of past underinvestment and growth in emerging markets gives it more credence, at least in commodities such as copper and iron ore.“There is massive infrastructure development not just in China but at various stages in countries all over the world, including India, Vietnam, Brazil and parts of Africa,” says Guy Elliott, finance director at Rio Tinto.“If we run out of investments that meet our criteria of quality and value, then we’ll return the cash,” he adds. “But I think this strong investment is needed and the smaller companies are less well-equipped to provide it.”Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest publicly traded copper miner, on Thursday declared a $1 a share special dividend, citing its strong cash position. That move can only strengthen the argument that UK-listed miners’ confidence in the value of future growth should be manifest in pay-outs to investors.
235;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-12-09T19:24:38Z;Freeport declares special $1 dividend;;Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s biggest copper miner by market capitalisation, has declared a special $1 per share dividend as the price of the red metal continues to rise sharply on strong demand from manufacturing countries such as China.In a sign of the rapid financial turnround the big mining companies have enjoyed since 2009, the US-based Freeport declared a two-for-one stock split and the unloading of $471m of excess cash to shareholders.“They are essentially net debt zero, and they have plenty of cash both to return to shareholders and to grow the business at the same time,” said Peter Ward, mining analyst at Barclays Capital in New York, where Freeport is listed. “This is what shareholders want to see, instead of them going out and doing a potentially dilutive acquisition.”BHP Billiton, which ranks with Freeport and Vale as the financially strongest companies in the mining sector, launched a $4.2bn share buy-back in November after failing to buy Canada’s PotashCorp for $39bn, in the first sign that miners are starting to return their gains to shareholders.Like iron ore, copper, the bellwether industrial metal, is being snapped up by Chinese manufacturers as China pushes forward with stimulus-boosted industrialisation. Some analysts think investors also are adding froth to the copper price.Copper is the most supply-­constrained of the main metals, as ore quality declines, South American mines suffer industrial relations strife and new mines fail to meet forecast demand.The supply and demand fundamentals pushed the benchmark copper price to a historic high of $9,000 per tonne this week, up 31 per cent in the past 12 months and 220 per cent from its low in 2009.This week’s prices equate to about $4 per pound. Freeport estimates its cash costs in producing copper will be 87 cents per pound in 2010.The company’s operating cash flows were $2.9bn in the first half of the year, compared with $900m in the first half of 2009. Analysts estimate its operating cash flow per share to be $13.80 in 2011.“The authorisation of this supplemental dividend reflects the strong current cash position and significant cash flows being generated by our global operations,” said Richard Adkerson, chief executive.Rio Tinto, Anglo American, and Xstrata – the big London-listed miners along with BHP – are all entering capital-intensive building phases. They carry higher debt than BHP and Freeport, suggesting these two companies’ moves to return cash will not necessarily be followed across the sector. Antofagasta, a “pure-play” copper producer like Freeport, is the company’s nearest equivalent in the ­London market.All of these mining companies are expected to generate strong, possibly record-setting, profits in 2010, according to analysts’ consensus forecasts. In the case of Rio and Xstrata, this comes after rights issues in 2009.
236;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-12-09T18:56:07Z;Financials help US stocks edge higher;;AIG soared after the bailed-out insurer agreed a restructuring plan, leading the financial sector higher as US stocks bumped against their two-year high.AIG jumped 9.2 per cent to $46.10 in the first day of trading since the announcement of the plan, which should bring the US Treasury closer to selling its huge stake.Trading in the stock had been halted on Wednesday while the news was released. The plan will see a secondary offering worth up to $20bn in the first half of next year.AIG also said it had agreed to repay a $20bn loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with money from the sale of its businesses in Asia and that the Treasury would convert its preferred stock into common shares, raising its stake to 92 per cent.Financials led the risers, up 0.4 per cent, as bank stocks were buoyed by hopes that a higher Treasury yield could boost profit.Bank of America jumped 2.6 per cent to $12.31, Wells Fargo gained 0.9 per cent to $29.62 and JPMorgan climbed 1.1 per cent to $40.71.Elsewhere in financials, BlackRock added 2.1 per cent to $177.37 after it was reported that the world’s largest money manager expected “very strong” earnings for the fourth quarter.But State Street sank 3.5 per cent to $44.57 after it said it had sold $11bn in mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities as part of a strategic repositioning of its investment portfolio, resulting in a $350m charge to be recorded in the fourth quarter.The S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent to 1,228.92 by midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.2 per cent to 11,344.89 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,610.65.Investors were cheered when data showed initial jobless claims had fallen more than expected last week with the four-week moving average hovering around two-year lows.But the government revised the previous week’s figure higher, saying claims tended to jump after the Thanksgiving holiday.“The holiday season normally creates volatility in these figures that doesn’t shake out until late January/early February, so unfortunately it will be difficult to draw firm conclusions from these data for a while,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Global markets and S&P futures had already been edging higher after data showed that Japan’s economy had grown faster than its government had initially calculated and that Australian employers had added more than double the number of workers previously forecast last month.Elsewhere, plans to return more money to shareholders were celebrated.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 1.6 per cent to $110.28 after the company announced a two-for-one stock split and a supplemental dividend of $1 a share, on the back of the rising price of copper.Richard Adkerson, chief executive, said: “Authorisation of this supplemental dividend reflects the strong current cash position and significant cash flows being generated by our global operations.”United Parcel Service added 1.1 per cent to $72.83, a 52-week high, after the delivery company’s chief financial officer told a German newspaper that it planned a higher dividend and more share buy-backs rather than use its free cash flow for large acquisitions.Whole Foods, the high-end supermarket, also announced that it would resume paying a dividend but its shares nudged down 0.4 per cent to $48.94.Analysts at JPMorgan said the company had discontinued its dividend in August 2008 because of negative free cash flow trends but, after eight quarters of robust cash flow generation, it now felt more comfortable.“We note that the ongoing dividend payment is a good indicator for the long-term outlook for the company and we believe this will be a positive catalyst for the stock,” they said.Meanwhile, Ford edged up 0.4 per cent to $16.75 after analysts at Bank of America raised the carmaker’s 2011 and 2012 earnings-per-share estimates. They added that its shares were likely to outperform on earnings growth and balance sheet improvement.

Lincoln National Corp jumped 7.5 per cent to $27.24, Hartford Financial Services added 3.5 per cent to $25 and MetLife gained 3.9 per cent to $42.79. AIG sunk 3.9 per cent to $42.23 before trading was halted just before the closing bell.Investors feared dilution when the US Treasury said it plans to sell about one-fifth of the insurer. It was reported that the sale, which would take place in the first half of 2011, could total more than $10bn.The company also struck a deal to repay its Federal Reserve credit line as it seeks independence from the government.The wider market’s gains were limited by the rising dollar and climbing bond yields after Tuesday’s agreement to extend the Bush-era tax cuts.Investors tried to gauge what was the primary cause of the rising rates – expectations of stronger economic growth or the resurfacing worries about inflation and the government deficit.The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,228.28, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,372.52 and the Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.4 per cent at 2,609.16.The materials sector lost 0.9 per cent with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold down 1.8 per cent to $108.60 and Cliffs Natural Resourcesdropping 2 per cent to $71.18.Elsewhere, Fortune Brands – which owns brands ranging from golf balls to Jim Bean whisky – gained 1 per cent to $61.76 after it said it planned to split itself into three separate businesses.The conglomerate will be divided into companies specialising in golf, home products and alcoholic drinks.Details of the plan, which is the result of a four-year strategic review, are expected to be finalised in the next several months.3M edged up 0.6 per cent to $84.05 as analysts weighed up the outlook given by the company on its investor day. On Tuesday shares in the industrial conglomerate declined after it forecast sales volumes at existing businesses would rise more slowly in 2011 than this year.Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation from “buy” to “neutral” and JPMorgan reiterated its “underweight” rating for 3M.“This is not about management as the durable 3M franchise is intact and has been enhanced through investment since chief executive [George] Buckley came aboard,” analysts at JP Morgan said. “This is more about an ongoing high level of expectations from a bullish sell side that has maintained stubbornly high estimates. We need to see some capitulation here.”In technology, Texas Instruments added 1 per cent to $33.75 after the US chipmaker narrowed its fourth-quarter profit and sales forecasts. But the reductions brought the company’s forecasts in line with analyst estimates and it said a recent correction in demand for its chips would be short-lived.Netflix’s chief financial officer, Barry McCarthy, resigned and will be replaced by David Wells, an internal appointment. Shares in the mail order online film rental service, which have soared 234 per cent so far this year, sank 0.8 per cent to $188.23.In retail, Home Depot edged higher by 1.4 per cent to $34.03 even though the home improvement retailer increased its full-year profit forecasts.

surging 4.6 per cent to $18.07 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gaining 4.1 per cent to $105.49.The S&P 500 industrials index jumped 2.6 per cent with Caterpillar, the best performing Dow stock in November, gaining 3.4 per cent to $87.45, Cummins adding 3.5 per cent to $100.52 and Honeywell advancing 2.4 per cent to $50.88.Investors were cheered by the Chinese Purchasing Managers’ Index, which climbed to a seven-month high, and the ISM index of US manufacturing activity, which slipped only slightly in November after a very strong October.In a big day for US economic data, ADP’s national employment report released before the opening bell showed that the number of private sector jobs had risen more than expectedin November.“Although we do not put great weight on ADP employment in our payroll forecast, it is worth noting that this is the strongest reading on ADP private payroll growth since Nov-ember 2007 (the month before the onset of the recession),” said John Ryding, of RDQ Economics.A separate report showed US non-farm productivity in the third quarter had grown faster than previously estimated. The upward revision of the figure, a leading indicator for hiring, matched economists’ expectations.Recruitment companies, which have risen significantly in the past couple of months, gained after the report. Monster Worldwide, which rose 25 per cent in November, added 1.7 per cent to $22.97 while Manpower was up 2.4 per cent to $57.27.Fears about the stability of the eurozone, which have dominated the market in the past two weeks, subsided after Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said the ECB could step up its purchases of eurozone bonds.A report showed US shoppers had spent 16 per cent more online on Monday, the busy internet shopping day now dubbed Cyber Monday, than on the same day last year.

But Amazon gained just 0.7 per cent to $176.55 and Ebay nudged up 0.4 per cent to $29.26.Google fell on Tuesday after the European Union said it had opened a full investigation into allegations from smaller competitors that the company
had abused its dominant market position. But the stock rebounded 1.6 per cent to $564.35 after it was reported the company planned to open an online store for electronic books in the US this year and internationally in 2011.American Express added 2.5 per cent to $44.30 after the payment processor was rated “overweight” by Richard Shane, an analyst at JPMorgan.Mr Shane started coverage of the stock with a 12-month price target of

239;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-11-11T19:40:03Z;Chinese buying drives copper to record;;Chinese buying has driven the price of copper to a record high of nearly $9,000 a tonne and traders warned that prices could rise a further 25 per cent next year to more than $11,000 as demand continues to outpace supply.The red metal is a crucial cog in the global economy as its use in electronics and construction means it is found in almost every appliance and building.The record price at the London Metal Exchange of $8,966 a tonne on Thursday makes copper the first major commodity to surpass its 2008 peak.Before the start of the commodities boom in 2004, copper traded at less than $2,000 a tonne.The sharp rise – the metal’s price is up almost 50 per cent since June – will deliver barnstorming profits to some of the world’s largest mining companies, including Freeport McMoran of the US, BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Rio Tinto, as well as the Chilean government, which owns Codelco, the world’s biggest copper miner.“It’s extraordinary,” said Gavin Prentice, managing director of Marex Financial, a brokerage. “But I think it has a lot further to go,” he added, echoing a widely held view on the market. Senior copper traders say the price could rise to $11,000-$12,000 a tonne next year as already tight inventories are drawn down further.Chinese buyers– who account for 40 per cent of global copper demand – have been largely absent from the market since September, put off by nearly record prices.But traders said they had returned over the past 48-72 hours, pushing up prices in Shanghai. The pick-up in local prices made importing copper into China profitable, hence pushing up global benchmark prices in London, they said.Yang Liang, a copper trader at Minmetals, the Chinese state-owned metals trading company, said the market was “very hot”.He added consumers could return again to the market early next year. “Demand in China is growing in a very stable way.”On Thursday China reported that its consumer price inflation had jumped to a two-year high of 4.4 per cent in October from 3.6 per cent the previous month, while industrial production and retail sales were also strong.Analysts expect demand to outstrip supply by more than 400,000 tonnes next year, and stocks of the metal have been drawn down as mine supply disappoints. A strike at Collahuasi, the world’s third largest copper mine, has raised concerns of further losses to output.
240;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-11-09T19:57:05Z;Chile miners’ strike turns cost of copper red hot;;A strike at one of the world’s biggest copper mines in Chile is threatening to send prices of the metal, widely used in industry, to an all-time high.As the dispute at the Collahuasi mine entered its fifth day, with no resolution in sight, copper prices rose 2.5 per cent to $8,882 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange on Tuesday, a two-year peak and within reach of the $8,940 record set in 2008.The sharp increase in the price of copper affects much of the global economy, because of its widespread use in manufacturing and construction, including in electrical wiring and appliances, and in pipes and rods in buildings. Mining companies such as Freeport McMoran, Xstrata and BHP Billiton are making huge profits from gains.With critically low inventories and roaring demand from Chinese manufacturers, copper prices have jumped nearly 50 per cent since June.Copper for immediate delivery rose substantially above the price of the benchmark three-month forward contract for the first time in more than a year on Monday, an indication of the market’s tightness. Traders says the effect of the Collahuasi strike is beginning to be felt.“If as we expect, metal stocks continue to decline then it’s not the right time to be disrupting supply,” says Richard Wilson, chairman of Brook Hunt, a metals consultancy.Collahuasi, owned by Xstrata and Anglo American high in the northern Chilean Andes, accounts for 3.3 per cent of the world’s mined copper, or 535,000 tonnes a year. The company says that replacement workers have been drafted in and output is normal for now.But union leaders say the company’s contingency plan only guarantees production of 20 per cent of the daily rate, estimated by the market at 1,500 tonnes.“The company may be able to keep this up 10 or 15 days, but we’re going to hold out until we reach our objectives. We’re waiting for them to call us. We’re not calling them,” Manuel Muñoz, president of the Collahuasi union says.That combative stance could set the tone for a new season of collective bargaining in the industry, where bosses and unions at Radomiro Tomic and El Teniente, which belong to state-owned Codelco, and Los Pelambres, controlled by Antofagasta, are due to begin talks in the coming months.Lengthy strikes in Chile are rare, but Escondida, the world’s top private copper mine, was hit by a month-long stoppage in 2006. Collahuasi has declined to say how long it could withstand a strike or when it has contractual deadlines.The strong-arm tactics by workers in the world’s top copper producing nation could have a big impact on prices in such a tight market.Inventories held at LME-registered warehouses have dropped 34 per cent since February and world demand is expected to outstrip supply by 400,000 tonnes next year. “There’s going to be a bunch of people working in copper mines who know they have a lot of bargaining power,” says Ric Deverell, commodities analyst at Credit Suisse.Bankers and industry executives say consumers of copper are keeping stocks low and operating “hand-to-mouth”, suggesting they could be forced to buy from the market regardless of price if demand continues to be strong.Juan Carlos Guajardo, executive director of Chile’s Centre for Copper and Mining Studies, says: “$9,000 is no longer the last frontier for copper. In the next two years, $10,000 will be the reference price.”The price of the red metal may yet scale its all-time peak before the week is out. Industry executives, bankers and senior traders believe it is likely to spike to $10,000 or even $11,000 a tonne in the first half of 2011.Mr Deverell expects inventories to fall to “critical levels” in the next few months. “This suggests that prices are likely to be increasingly sensitive to small changes in supply or demand,” he says.Slightly more than 200,000 tonnes of metal has been lost annually from global supplies since 2005 due to strikes, according to Brook Hunt. Max Layton, analyst at Macquarie, says the biggest impact of any strikes is likely to be on investor sentiment, since many supply projections include an allowance for disruptions: “It’s another catalyst to buy.”

Cliffs Natural Resources jumped 4.7 per cent to $70.00 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold surged 7 per cent to $103.89.Stephen Wood, chief market strategist for North America at Russell Investment, said stocks could rally into the end of the year as diminished uncertainty after quantitative easing, the midterms and stabilising jobs and housing data helped investor confidence.“Cyclicals like energy and materials are very good suspects for leading markets [where as] financials have a lot of question marks like Basel III and Dodd-Frank,” he said.He added that natural resources stocks were soaring partly due to quantitative easing but also because of expectations that China would end its tightening cycle in the first half of next year.The financials rallied later in the session, up 3.4 per cent, after it was reported that the Federal Reserve might allow banks with strong capital levels to increase dividends. The two biggest banks by assets led the risers. Bank of America jumped 5.2 per cent to $12.12 and JPMorgan Chase shot up 5.5 per cent to $39.80.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 retailers index rose 1.7 per cent, lifting the wider consumer discretionary sector by 1.6 per cent as retailers reported their October same-store sales.Gap, Target and Macy’s all beat expectations. Gap jumped 6.1 per cent to $20.43, Target climbed 1.5 per cent to $54.76 and Macy’s gained 6.6 per cent to $25.56.Even shares in Kohl’s, where same-store sales fell and the retailer lowered its third-quarter outlook, rose 2.3 per cent to $51.92.Some retailers also reported their quarterly earnings. Limited Brands, which owns the Victoria’s Secret chain, advanced 5.3 per cent to $31.43 after it beat estimates. Shares in Limited Brands have risen 68.2 per cent this year.In food retail stores, Whole Foods rocketed 15.1 per cent to $47.27 after the upmarket grocer raised its 2011 profit forecast and beat expectations in its fourth quarter. Same-store sales rose 8.7 per cent as customers dipped into their pockets for more organic and gourmet foods.At the other end of the spectrum, Costco, the warehouse club operator, said its same-store sales rose 6 per cent in October. Its shares were higher by 3.7 per cent to $65.48.News Corp, the owner of Fox News and newspapers around the world, beat expectations as advertising recovered. Revenue grew 17 per cent at Fox News after it led the cable news ratings, helping to increase operating income at the division by 23 per cent. But its shares edged down 0.6 per cent to $14.75.Cable operators also beat expectations with their quarterly earnings as they added more internet and phone subscribers.Time Warner Cable said it added more internet customers even though the number of basic video subscribers fell. Revenue and profit rose and the company said it would launch a $4bn share buy-back programme. Its shares advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.33.Cablevision Systems also reported better-than-expected results. Its shares jumped 2.6 per cent to $28.36.US-listed shares in PotashCorp dropped 2.4 per cent to $141.97 after the Canadian government rejected BHP Billiton’s $39bn bid. Potash shares have risen 29.2 per cent this year as the Australian miner has pursued the company. BHP Billiton, which added 6 per cent to $91.20, has 30 days to appeal.
242;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-10-26T18:56:28Z;Congo resolves dispute over copper mine;;Freeport-McMoRan, the US copper mining group, has resolved a long-standing dispute with the Democratic Republic of Congo over control of a vast copper mine by giving cash and shares to the government.The Tenke Fungurume project, which could be ranked among the world’s top 10 new sources of copper, has been plagued by uncertainty since 2007, when Congo’s government decided to review all mining licences signed during the war in the country between 1998 and 2003.More than a year of negotiations, thought to have involved the US government in support of Freeport, led to changes to the Tenke licence. Under the new terms, Gecamines, the state mining company, will own 20 per cent of Tenke, an increase from 17.5 per cent.Freeport will pay $30m to Congo “in six instalments after reaching certain production milestones”, as well as $5m in “surface area fees”.Freeport started producing copper at Tenke in south-eastern Katanga province in March 2009 and is still working towards full production. But until last Friday it did not have a clear licence.Perception of risk surrounding the Tenke licence increased in August when Canada’s First Quantum Minerals was stripped of the last of its assets in Congo.The “international outcry” caused by this dispute might have “accelerated the settlement by strengthening Freeport’s position and giving the government a greater incentive to show that it is not all bad”, said Chris Melville, an Africa mining specialist with Menas Associates.
243;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-10-26T16:03:37Z;Congo deals threaten western aid supply;;Western donors have begun withholding development aid from the Democratic Republic of Congo amid mounting concern over the mismanagement of the mining and energy sectors by Joseph Kabila, president, and some of his aides.The recent resale of a copper project expropriated from Canadian company First Quantum and the reallocation of oil concessions claimed by Tullow Oil of the UK are among several deals jeopardising western support for the country’s recovery from years of conflict.Congo has some of the richest mineral deposits in Africa. But commercial disputes have raised risk perceptions to “maximum”, according to Barclays Capital, while international arbitration could burden one of Africa’s poorest countries with billions of dollars in compensation claims, should Congo lose.The country is broadly on track in its macroeconomic management, according to a recent review of the International Monetary Fund’s $550m programme.However, the business climate has been plagued by high-level corruption reminiscent of the 32-year misrule of the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, against a backdrop of escalating violence in the east of the country and repression in the capital, Kinshasa.“There is general discomfort about economic governance and the investment climate. Donors are asking questions before putting in more money,” said a senior donor official. “This is a country with great potential that needs substantial investment. It really needs to demonstrate it is doing everything as transparently as possible.”Congo has fixed its 2011 budget at $6.7bn, with a financing gap of more than $3bn that Kinshasa hopes will be met by external creditors.Donor officials said the World Bank had so far withheld $100m in budgetary support and suspended fresh project lending. Other donor organisations are beginning to follow suit, with the European Union withholding €50m ($69m) of budget funding.Concerns about the investment climate could also lead the Paris Club of creditors to postpone the rescheduling of the country’s remaining $2.9bn of debt, western officials said.“The World Bank Group has been concerned by the deterioration in economic governance and legal security in recent months. This deterioration threatens potential investment. It also risks undermining the effectiveness of government in mobilising both its domestic resources and donor supported funding,” said a World Bank spokesperson.First Quantum was Congo’s largest taxpayer. However, the company has infuriated Mr Kabila by refusing to review its contracts covering concessions awarded during the war between 1998 and 2003. Dozens of other mining groups have renegotiated their deals – both under and across the table.Mr Kabila reissued rights to the company’s tailings project at Kolwezi to businesses controlled by Dan Gertler, an Israeli magnate with whom he has a close relationship.In August, a majority shareholding in Kolwezi and two other assets was sold on to Eurasian Natural Resources Corp, a company listed on the FTSE 100, for $175m and a $400m loan.Congo, according to a western diplomat, had given verbal assurances to the World Bank and IMF that it would refrain from reassigning the disputed concession until a related case has been settled at the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.The World Bank and IMF boards are understood to have taken those assurances into consideration when finalising a $10.8bn write-off of historic debt.By reallocating the concession, in which First Quantum had invested $750m, and seizing another mine, Mr Kabila is seen to have thumbed his nose at donor concerns.The case has proved especially awkward for the World Bank, which had been relatively relaxed about governance in Congo, as its private sector arm, the International Financial Corporation, is a minority shareholder in the project.“If the World Bank formally suspends funding, that could torpedo the relationship. So they are trying to concretely signal their displeasure without causing a rupture,” said a western official, adding that “getting it right without being taken for fools would be quite difficult”.Concession to Kinshasa seals copper mine’s futureFreeport-McMoRan, the US copper mining group, has resolved a long-standing dispute with the Democratic Republic of Congo over control of a vast copper mine by giving cash and shares to the government, writes William MacNamara.The Tenke Fungurume project, which could be ranked among the world’s top 10 new sources of copper, has been plagued by uncertainty since 2007, when Congo’s government decided to review all mining licences signed during the war in the country between 1998 and 2003.More than a year of negotiations, thought to have involved the US government in support of Freeport, led to changes to the Tenke licence.

Analysts at FBR Capital Markets said they preferred large banks to the regionals but cast doubt on the long-term prospects for financials.The analysts said that, in the short term, banks were benefiting from releasing reserves because of improving credit quality.But they added that this benefit could wane before longer term organic revenue drivers, such as higher interest rates and a growth in loans, return.Banks also started to head lower after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that regulators are probing the sector’s mortgage foreclosure practices. Bank of America lost 2.5 per cent to $11.16 and Wells Fargo declined 1.5 per cent to $25.72.Citigroup was the main bright spot in financials, rising 2.4 per cent to $4.21 after Richard Ramsden, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, added the bank to his “conviction buy” list. He raised Citigroup’s price target to $5.50, saying that the shares could rise as much as 34 per cent in the next 12 months.Invesco, the investment management company, fell 0.9 per cent to $22.11 even though profits rose 47 per cent, helped by its acquisition of Morgan Stanley’s mutual fund business in June.CommScope, the communications cable maker, said it is in takeover talks with The Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. The potential deal would be worth $31.50 per share in cash or $2.98bn. CommScope surged 30.5 per cent to $30.16.

247;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-10-13T08:59:23Z;Copper hits 2-year high on bullish miners;Copper miners expected to struggle to meet soaring demand in 2011;Copper miners will struggle to meet soaring demand in 2011, the world’s two largest producers have warned, painting a bullish picture for the metal, which many senior traders and investors expect will reach a record within the next year.Their upbeat comments, in video interviews with the Financial Times, came as copper prices this week hit a two-year high. In early trading at the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three months hit of $8,415 a tonne on Wednesday, up 1 per cent.The price of the metal, used widely in manufacturing, has risen nearly 40 per cent since early June and is within striking distance of the record of $8,940 set in mid-2008.“The price will be strong because supply is challenged and demand will continue to be strong,” said Richard Adkerson, chief executive of US-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold , the world’s largest listed copper miner.Diego Hernández, chief executive of the Chilean state-owned miner Codelco, the world’s largest copper miner, added the market “should be very tight” in 2011.Many of the industry’s senior figures, gathered for LME Week, believe the red metal will surpass its previous record within months. “The consensus here is as positive as I’ve ever seen it,” Mr Adkerson said.Traders pay attention to Freeport-McMoRan and Codelco’s views because, between them, the two groups account for nearly a quarter of global copper output.Analysts and traders expect demand for the red metal to outstrip supply next year by more than 400,000 tonnes – more than all the stocks at LME-registered warehouses, driven by stagnating mine output.“The big challenge is that the quality of the new projects is worse than what we have in production now,” Mr Hernández said. “To develop those projects you need to believe in a higher copper price.” Mr Adkerson added: “Pits are getting larger, systems are older, and all of those things lead to an environment where you expect to see the industry having continuing supply challenges.”At the same time, China’s continuing impressive growth is boosting demand for copper and other industrial commodities.Bankers, investors and mining executives at the LME gathering said that copper would trade between $8,000 and $10,000 a tonne next year, according to a poll carried out by Macquarie, the investment bank which specialises in mining.Martyn Whitehead, head of metals and mining sales at Barclays Capital, said he expected a new high for copper in 2011: “We remain very friendly to copper. We could . . . see it print $10,000 [a tonne],” he said.Other base metals also surged on Wednesday amid bullish talk at the LME Week and a weaker US dollar. Tin prices hit an all-time high of $27,100 a tonne, up 2.6 per cent on the day, as production in Indonesia, the world’s largest exporter, comes below expectations. Aluminium rose 0.5 per cent to $2,447 a tonne, its highest since April.Lead jumped 2.3 per cent to $2,430 a tonne, the highest since January, while zinc and nikel also posted gains. The LME index, a basket which tracks the cost of industrial metals, hit its highest level in more than two years.

The Dow has not closed above 11,000 since May 3.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent higher at 2,401.91, gaining 1.5 per cent on the week.After rallying on Tuesday, markets have been tepid, often moving in opposition to the dollar. Materials stocks were the main gainers over the week as the weak dollar pushed commodity prices up.On Friday, the government’s non-farm payroll data showed that the US economy unexpectedly lost 95,000 jobs in September when economists had forecast a slight drop of about 5,000. A drop in government employment pulled the total figure down. Private payrolls climbed by 64,000 against a forecast for a gain of about 75,000.“We can’t get too excited because the figures are not strong, but it’s not even clear that it’s so weak that it could guarantee quantitative easing,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.“Between now and that two-day meeting [of the Federal Open Market Committee] on 2-3 November, we’ll continue to see the market move from hot to cold and cold to hot.”He added that the preliminary reading for third-quarter gross domestic product, released days before the meeting, will be closely watched.Materials stocks led the risers once again, advancing 2 per cent. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold added 4.5 per cent to $95.51, AK Steel advanced 4.2 per cent to $14.48 and US Steel rose 3.3 per cent to $45.92. Alcoa also helped buoy the materials sector as it kicked off the earnings season, announcing its results after the closing bell on Thursday.The shares surged 5.7 per cent to $12.89 after the aluminium producer beat expectations with earnings of 6 cents per share, compared with estimates of 5 cents. Net income fell because of a decline in prices which did not outweigh the rising demand for industrial goods.The company raised its outlook for global aluminium consumption in 2010 to grow at a rate of 13 per cent from a previous projection of 12 per cent, driven by emerging economies.Chipmaker Micron Technology also reported earnings after the closing bell. The shares rose 6.8 per cent to $7.59 even though it missed estimates on profit and revenue. In the fourth quarter, net income was 32 cents per share, compared with the consensus forecast of 38 cents.The company said that weak spending by corporations and consumers had hit PC memory chip prices and warned that in the long term, the rise of tablet computers such as the Apple iPad, would affect demand for PCs.In deals news, the Genzyme board asked shareholders to reject a $69 a share bid from French pharmaceutical group Sanofi-Aventis, saying the valuation did not recognise the potential of its experimental drug pipeline. The company, which makes treatments for rare genetic conditions, said that Sanofi had proposed a price range of $69 a share to $80 a share at a meeting on September 20.Shares in Genzyme gained 0.5 per cent to $72.75 while US-listed shares in Sanofi-Aventis nudged up 0.5 per cent to $34.21.BlackBerry maker Research in Motion rose 3 per cent to $49.36 after the United Arab Emirates said it would not ban use of the handset as previously planned next week because the company had now complied with its regulations.
249;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-10-05T20:47:21Z;US stocks rally on Bank of Japan’s QE policy;;US equities jumped to their highest since mid-May after the Bank of Japan unveiled plans to ease monetary policy and better-than-expected data on the US services sector sparked hopes of a speedier global economic recovery.The S&P 500 closed up 2.1 per cent to 1,160.73, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.8 per cent to close at 10,944.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.4 per cent higher at 2,399.83.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rallied more than 1 per cent with six soaring more than 2 per cent, led by the materials and industrials indices.The Bank of Japan said that it was considering creating a Y5,000bn ($59.7bn) fund to buy assets to increase liquidity in the financial system, and lowered its interest rate.Some investors hoped this might open the door for the Federal Reserve to extend its own programme of quantitative easing.Shares rose further after a report showed the US services sector was re-bounding faster than ex-pected.But the positive data made Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, question whether the Fed would be prepared to intervene.“Both the headline and the details of the non-manufacturing Institute of Supply Management index came in better than expected and as a result the pressure on the Fed to execute QE2 [a second round of quantitative easing] has been reduced,” he said.“QE2 is very data dependant because the way to convince the dissenters is for the data to come in weaker than expected.”The index rose to 53.2 in September, compared with the average economist forecast of 52.Materials and industrials sectors were lifted by hopes for a faster economic recovery.The S&P 500 materials index led the risers, advancing 2.8 per cent with Dow Chemical adding 3.6 per cent to $28.47, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gaining 4.5 per cent to $91.18 and Newmont Mining rising 1.5 per cent to $63.67.The industrials sector was up 2.7 per cent with Caterpillar climbing 2.8 per cent to $79.40 and Cummins rising 2.8 per cent to $92.24.In energy stocks, Chevron rose 2.6 per cent to $83.39 after the oil company said it plans to resume its share buy-back programme this quarter, repurchasing up to $1bn of stock.Financials also rose, up 2.4 per cent, after analysts at JPMorgan Chase said banks were likely to beat the third quarter profit estimates, even though many other analysts have recently raised concerns about their earnings.Bank of America jumped 3.1 per cent to $13.56, Citigroup gained 2.5 per cent to $4.13 and JPMorgan Chase added 1.8 per cent to $39.64.Information technology stocks added 1.9 per cent with PC maker Dell rising 3.9 per cent to $13.40 after Steve Schuckenbrock, the head of its large enterprise business, said it was seeing good demand for new personal computers in offices.Texas Instruments soared 4.1 per cent to $28.33, Google jumped 3 per cent to $538.23 and Apple rose 3.7 per cent to $288.94.Although the earnings season officially kicks off with Alcoa’s results on Thursday, some companies were already updating the market on their performance in the last quarter.Fertiliser maker Mosaic missed expectations with its first-quarter earnings in spite of tripling profits as sales of its products surged 50 per cent. Earnings were 67 cents per share, compared with the average estimate of 71 cents. But the shares still rose 3.4 per cent to $60.80.Talbots, the women’s clothing chain, sunk 14.6 per cent to $10.71 after it forecast third-quarter sales would fall. It had previously predicted a rise in sales in the third quarter, but now sees a decline, because the number of customers passing through the doors has been “inconsistent”.The company predicts earnings per share for the quarter of between 22 and 28 cents compared with the average estimate of 27 cents. But for the full year, the retailer still sees a 1 per cent rise in sales and earnings per share of between 84 and 92 cents.MaxLinear also lowered its third-quarter sales forecast to no more than $18.6m, when the average estimate was $20.3m.Shares plummeted 11.7 per cent to $10.03.

The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher ending the day at 2,370.75, losing 0.4 per cent over the week.Before the opening bell, investors were cheered when manufacturing in China rose more than expected in September.But the sentiment was short-lived. Figures showed that US manufacturing had expanded at the lowest pace for 10 months. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index fell to 54.4 from 56.3 in August in line with expectations but the details disappointed.Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said: “The spread between new orders and inventories has finally moved into negative territory (which means the inventory index is higher than orders), suggesting that production should slow somewhat over the next few months as an increasing portion of new orders can be met by drawing down existing inventories.”In a busy day for economic data, other releases were mixed.Among the positive numbers, US consumers were shown to have been spending slightly more than forecast, car sales rose and construction spending had unexpectedly risen. The final reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment was also a little better than expected.But prices barely rose in August, showing that inflation remains subdued,Materials and energy benefited from hopes of rising Chinese demand for metals and oil.The energy sector led the risers, up 1.3 per cent, with Hess Corp adding 3 per cent to $60.92 and Marathon Oil Corp gaining 2.2 per cent to $33.81.The materials sector advanced 1.2 per cent, with Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold adding 4.4 per cent to $89.13 and iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources rising 4.2 per cent to $66.58.But the effect of the Chinese data on industrials was muted by a couple of ratings downgrades so the S&P 500 industrials index was up only 0.1 per cent.Caterpillar fell 0.6 per cent to $78.22 after its rating was cut from “buy” to “neutral” by analysts at Bank of America. They view the shares, which have risen 15.4 per cent in the past month, as having the strong earnings expected in the next year priced in.Deere & Co also suffered after analysts at JPMorgan Chase reduced it from “overweight” to “neutral”, saying higher pension and research and development costs could weigh on earnings. Wells Fargo also cut its rating on the farm equipment maker. The shares fell 1.7 per cent to $68.57.Elsewhere, HP declined 3.1 per cent to $40.77 after the company named its new chief executive. After the closing bell on Thursday, the technology company announced it was appointing Leo Apotheker, the former chief executive of software maker SAP, to the top job.The choice surprised analysts because Mr Apotheker spent only a year as SAP’s sole chief executive and they had not expected an appointment from outside the US.Also in technology, Google edged lower by a fraction to $525.62 after David Drummond, its chief legal officer, said the search engine operator was increasing staff and trying to win new advertisers in China, in spite of its clash with the authorities over censorship.
251;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-09-29T21:30:42Z;Tightening copper supply buoys prices;Investors push red metal to above $8,000 a tonne;"The price of copper surged above $8,000 a tonne to its highest level since the financial crisis, as tightening physical supplies spurred investors to pour money into the red metal.Analysts, producers and investors are almost unanimously bullish about the prospects for copper in the next year, with many believing the metal could rise to an all-time high above $9,000 a tonne.Michael Jansen, metals analyst at JPMorgan said: “It looks like the Chinese will probably run down their inventory level through to year-end as much as they can, but
eventually they’ll have to come back to the market and buy.”The surge in copper bodes well for the world’s largest miners of the metal, such as Freeport McMoran, BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Rio Tinto, as current prices are far above their production costs. Other base metals have also rallied in recent months, with tin on Wednesday hitting a fresh two-year peak of $24,390 a tonne – just 5 per cent off an all-time high.The price of copper, used widely by the construction and electronics industries, is closely watched as a leading indicator of economic growth – particularly in China, where the urbanisation trend in the world’s most populous country has caused copper consumption to skyrocket.But the current rally is being driven just as much by supply. Production is stagnating as ore grades fall at mines that were opened in the 1980s – and analysts see only modest growth in the coming years.Output from the world’s top four listed copper miners fell 12 per cent year-on-year in the first half of 2010. Stocks of the metal at London Metal Exchange-
registered warehouses have fallen 32 per cent since February, as consumers snap up the red metal faster than new material is being delivered to warehouses.That has begun to interest investors. Hedge funds are more bullish about copper than any other commodity, apart from gold, bankers say.“At a $7,000-$8,000 copper price it doesn’t make a great deal of difference to how producers are going to act. It’s basically all about financial markets,” Mr Jansen said, predicting the surge in investor demand would continue.The market was further supported on Wednesday by news that the Indian authorities had ordered Vedanta to close its large Tuticorin copper smelter for environmental reasons.LME copper for delivery in three months hit an intraday peak of $8,075 a tonne, its highest since mid-2008, before settling at $8,045, up 0.8 per cent on the day. The price of the red metal has nearly tripled since the start of 2009.Indices of manufacturing activity in the US and China, to be released on Friday, are likely to drive prices in the near-term, traders said.Elsewhere, precious metals continued their spectacular run of form: gold hit a new all-time peak of $1,313.20 an ounce and silver touched a new 30-year high of $22 an ounce. The metals are up 5.4 per cent and 13.2 per cent respectively so far this month.In oil, ICE November Brent crude rose above $80 a barrel for the first time in more than a month, closing $2.06 higher at $80.77. Nymex November West Texas Intermediate was up $1.68 at $77.86."

Economists had forecast an increase of 1 per cent for the leading indicator of manufacturing activity. Including transportation, orders fell 1.3 per cent as Boeing saw civilian aircraft orders decline sharply.“It’s the realisation that the double dip is receding in probability and I would say the durable goods data today is in some sense the frosting on the cake,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist with Principal Global Investors. Mr Baur said it was natural to see a weakening in economic growth after a sharp rise.“Old Mother Hubbard’s cupboard was bare so manufacturers had to ramp up production very fast from a low level just to put stuff on the shelves. Then this began to decelerate and that’s where everyone starts to worry.”All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rose – nine rising more than 1 per cent and six more than 2 per cent.Industrials led the risers, up 2.8 per cent, on hopes for a speedier economic recovery.

Amazon hit an all-time high, rising 5.2 per cent to $160.73.Chipmakers were in focus after Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, said the software maker might buy a chip manufacturer.Oracle fell 0.6 per cent to $26.96 but US-listed shares of ARM Holdings, which designs chips that power iPhones, surged 7.6 per cent to $19.79 on speculation that it could be a target.Advanced Micro Devices, a chipmaker, rose 6.9 per cent to $6.84 in spite of saying third-quarter sales would be weaker than predicted because of lower demand for notebook computers in Europe and North America.Rival Intel, which reduced its forecast at the end of August, gained
2.3 per cent to $19.42.Gold companies, which have risen this week with the price of gold, continued to climb, with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold up 2.8 per cent to $86.61."

The better-than-expected headline figures on manufacturing and unemployment sparked a four-session rally, but details in the reports created concerns about the pace of the economic recovery.The S&P 500 financial sector slid 2.4 per cent on the back of worries about European banks.

255;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-09-02T22:04:37Z;Optimism over China demand bolsters copper;;Copper rose to a four-month high on Thursday as optimism about Chinese demand buoyed the industrial metals markets amid tightening physical supplies.The red metal’s sensitivity to the strength of the global economy has earned it the nickname Dr Copper and its rise to within $400 of a two-year high is seen by some as evidence that fears of a double-dip recession are overdone.Analysts said the copper market was responding to strong industrial demand around the world as well as the prospect of tightening supply as mine production disappoints.Many believe copper is likely to rally strongly in the coming months and could hit a record high above $9,000 a tonne in the next year.“The fundamentals have begun to reassert themselves,” said Ric Deverell, commodities analyst at Credit Suisse.“After moving in lockstep with other risk assets over the first half of the year, continued strong industrial demand has surprised many as metals have outperformed since mid-year.”Data released on Wednesday surprised traders by pointing to an upturn in manufacturing, especially in China, where concerns over cooling growth have been a source of jitters.US employment data released on Friday would be important in determining sentiment in the short term, but in the longer run investors were increasingly looking to China and other Asian countries as the drivers of the copper price, said David Wilson, metals analyst at Société Générale in London.“I wouldn’t say the US has completely lost its relevance, but it’s not so big an issue as it was in the past,” he said.Copper and other industrial metals such as tin are also being driven by supply constraints.The collective output of the top four listed copper miners– Freeport-McMoRan, BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Rio Tinto – dropped 12 per cent in the first half of 2010 from a year earlier.As a result, copper inventories at London Metal Exchange warehouses have fallen 28 per cent since February and there has been a sharp rise in copper premiums – the cost of physical delivery of metal above the LME price.“Discussions with producers continue to suggest that the physical market remains very tight for many metals, particularly copper,” Mr Deverell said.“Indeed, judging by base metals’ price changes over the past week of trading, investors may already have jumped on to this bandwagon.”Copper for delivery in three months gained 0.9 per cent to an intraday peak of $7,689 a tonne on the LME, its highest since April and up 25 per cent since early June.Zinc for delivery in three months gained 2.2 per cent to its own four-month peak of $2,194 a tonne while tin was hovering just below a two-year high at $21,500 a tonne, up 0.35 per cent on the day.Platinum and palladium, used as catalysts in converters that clean car exhausts, rallied. Spot platinum gained 1.9 per cent to $1,557.50 a troy ounce while palladium was near a four-month high at $523 an ounce.Nymex October West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled $1.11 higher at $75.02, buoyed by news of a rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico.ICE October Brent rose 58 cents to close at $76.93.
256;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-08-29T20:19:53Z;Copper;Tight supply is playing a greater role in the latest price resurgence;"In Chile, 33 miners trapped half a mile down a copper and gold mine bravely await their rescue. Around the world, cowardly thieves steal copper cable. Both are the result of robust demand for the red metal. At $7,447 a tonne, copper’s spot price is 165 per cent above its mid-financial crisis low, though still 16 per cent shy of its July 2008 pre-crisis high.Industrial demand explains only part of the increase. In spite of doubts over the pace of global recovery, China is growing fast and accounts for 40 per cent of world consumption, and developed economies are restocking depleted stores. Then there is speculative interest from financial investors who are drawn by copper’s supply-demand imbalances.Tight supply, after all, plays a greater role in copper’s latest resurgence. Declining inventories are one factor; disappointing first-half production figures from miners such as Freeport-McMoRan, BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Rio Tinto another. Chile’s state-owned Codelco, the world’s biggest producer, expects unchanged production this year. The Chilean earthquake hit Antofagasta, which expects output to fall this year but surge next with the expansion of its mine called Esperanza (Spanish for “hope”).Mining companies that slashed capital expenditure in the downturn cannot expect big increases in output for a further two to three years. Then there is the dearth of new copper assets. Flagship projects such as Chile’s Escondida (literally “hidden”) are past their prime; deposits of the same scale and quality remain elusive. Moreover, it is harder to boost production in older mines, which can be deeper and have lower ore grades.With demand growth put by miners at more than 7 per cent this year and supply rising by about a third of that, the outlook seems copper-bottomed – and destined to stay that way so long as miners’ hope remains hidden in the earth.E-mail the Lex team confidentially"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen 1.1 per cent to 10,097.44, but was lower by 1.1 per cent on the week, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9 per cent to 2,137.59, although it had lost 1.9 per cent over the five days.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 were up, with six rising more than 1 per cent.Sectors that have fallen recently on the back of weak economic news, rebounded, with the S&P 500 materials index leading the risers, up 2.3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold surged 5.1 per cent to $70.53, Dow Chemicals rose 3.6 per cent to $24.60 and Cliffs Natural Resources jumped 3.5 per cent to $59.44.Trading in Intel was temporarily halted twice. First, a fall in its shares triggered the circuit breaker that was introduced after May’s “flash crash”. When trading was restarted, shares rebounded sharply, kicking the circuit breakers into action again.Intel shares dropped to a low of $16.55 after the company cut its revenue forecast for the third quarter because of weak demand for PCs. However, by midday the shares were trading up 1.1 per cent, at $18.39.The broader indices briefly followed Intel shares down, falling 0.7 per cent before quickly rebounding.Elsewhere, deals news dominated after the battle between Dell and Hewlett-Packard for 3Par, the “cloud computing” company, stepped up a gear.HP reopened the bidding after the close on Thursday even though 3Par had already accepted a $24.30-a-share bid from Dell. HP raised its offer to $27 and Dell matched the new offer and said that 3Par had accepted its new proposal. But as the bell rung on Friday morning, HP swooped in, offering an even higher bid of $30 a share, or $2bn.Shares in 3Par jumped 21.8 per cent to $31.72, with Dell rose 2.2 per cent to $12.01 and HP fell 1.7 per cent to $37.59.US-listed shares of BHP Billiton, which has bid for fertiliser producer PotashCorp, rose 1.2 per cent to $66.56 after Potash’s partners in a Canadian cartel, Mosaic and Agrium, launched a campaign that could impede the takeover bid.

Its shares surged 31 per cent to $19.55.
258;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-08-18T18:09:14Z;Dwindling mines mean hot times for copper;With demand set to outstrip supply, prices can only move higher;Hedge funds are not the only ones that have been burned by their activities in commodity markets recently. This week a man was admitted to hospital in northern England after receiving an electric shock cutting through a live wire carrying 11,000 volts trying to steal the copper it contained.Thefts of copper cables and rods are increasing as tightness in the physical copper markets has caused prices to rebound.“This year we’ve seen a massive increase in theft from our sub-station sites,” says Phil Wilson, customer operations manager for one of Eon’s regional electricity distribution networks in the UK, which suffered 37 incidents in Coventry in the past week alone.Thefts may be about to get much worse. While copper prices have rebounded to $7,400 a tonne from just above $6,000 in early June, sentiment among investors, analysts and industry executives is almost unanimously bullish.“We continue to feel very, very positive about the outlook for copper,” says Richard Adkerson, chief executive of Freeport McMoran, the world’s largest listed copper miner.Paul Robinson, head of non-ferrous metals at CRU Group, the consultancy, describes himself as “extremely bullish” on prospects for the red metal.The reason is supply: the superstar copper mines of the 1980s, such as Escondida in Chile, may have already seen their best days and few believe there is enough new production coming onstream in the next few years to meet even modest demand growth.“Even if you make bearish assumptions about the global economic recovery, the copper market is still tight,” says Max Layton, analyst at Macquarie in London. It looks as if most analysts agree. Indeed, out of 19 analysts polled by Reuters last month, each one thought copper demand would outstrip supply next year. Such a clear consensus is rare in commodity markets where data are sketchy and demand so dependent on economic growth.For that reason, many analysts are predicting copper could hit a new all-time high above $9,000 in the next 12 months. “That’s the easy call, the hard call is what month?” says Mr Layton. He reckons March.An increasing number see $10,000 a tonne – a 35 per cent increase on current prices – as a realistic possibility within the next two or three years.The copper market’s tight fundamentals have not gone unnoticed by the hedge fund community. Martyn Whitehead, head of metals sales at Barclays Capital, says funds and corporates are looking “beyond the fog of the macro picture and realising declining grades and producer underperformance is increasingly the driving factor”.Leon Westgate, commodities analyst at Standard Bank, says: “Pressure is certainly building on funds to try and make a return. Some of the guys who are bullish are looking to start building a position [in copper] now.”Current market tightness stems from years of disappointing production from the top copper miners. In the first half of the year, the world’s top four listed copper miners – Freeport McMoran, BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Rio Tinto – saw their collective output drop 12 per cent from 2009. State-owned Chilean miner Codelco, the world’s largest copper producer, said in May it expected similar output in 2010 to the previous year.Richard Wilson, chairman of Brook Hunt, the metals consultancy, says the copper mining industry has undershot production expectations by an average of 6 per cent a year in the past five years. “One of the key issues surrounding copper supply has been the inability of copper mines to meet their production targets,” he says.That is reflected in the physical copper market with inventories lower at exchange registered warehouses. London Metal Exchange copper inventories have fallen more than 25 per cent since February, bucking the usual trend to rise during the summer period.Much of the problem stems from lower quality ore. After years of intensive output, many mines that were developed in the 1980s now produce ore with ever lower copper content – meaning more and more earth must be moved to keep copper output constant.“Most mine projects will exploit the highest ore grades possible in their early years of production to facilitate rapid payback of capital. The trade-off then becomes sharply falling grades as mining progresses,” says Mr Wilson at Brook Hunt.At the same time, two decades of low prices meant little money was invested in discovering and developing new deposits. Because copper mines can take as long as 15 years to start producing from the initial investment, says Mr Robinson of CRU, “there’s very little that the miners can do to deal with consumption growth in the next four to five years”.And, in spite of fears over the strength of the global economy, copper demand has been robust, industry executives say. Tom Albanese, chief executive of Rio Tinto, tells the Financial Times: “We could have sold more copper [in the first half of 2010] if we’d had it.”Bernd Drouven, chief executive of Aurubis, Europe’s largest producer of refined copper, says demand for his company’s copper products is strong and in some cases rising.That bodes badly for those battling growing copper theft. Glyn Hellam of the British Transport Police says the rate of copper thefts closely tracks the price of the metal. If copper prices rise, he says, “it is entirely likely we will see an increase in incidents”.Mr Robinson believes the industry must get used to a “new norm” for copper prices. “Copper just shouldn’t be used for piping – it’s too expensive,” he says. “You wouldn’t use gold for piping.”Additional reporting by Javier Blas

The Vix index, a measure of market volatility, jumped 13.4 per cent to 25.37, the biggest leap since the end of June.The Fed failed to reassure investors with its pledge to buy longer-dated Treasuries with money from maturing mortgage holdings. After the Fed announcement on Tuesday, stocks pared their losses but did not enter positive territory.“This is looking like a correction from last week’s positive sentiment and expectations that the Fed might do more quantitative easing, which it seems was mere speculation,”
said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets.“I’m really looking for some choppy markets for the foreseeable future as we’ve had a bit of a run-up from the end of June and particularly in July. It’s a traders’ market instead of an investors’ market – no one has got a lot of conviction and they’re not holding on to positions.”Markets were shaken further by data released before the bell which showed that the US trade deficit unexpectedly widened 18.8 per cent to $49.9bn in June as imports of consumer goods from China and the rest of the world soared while US exports fell.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 fell more than 1 per cent, with eight falling more than 2 per cent.Materials and energy stocks, which were hit by the fall in metals and oil prices when China reported a drop in import growth on Tuesday, continued their decline after more negative data from China showed a slowdown in factory output.The S&P 500 Materials sector fell 3.4 per cent, with aluminium producer Alcoa down 6.1 per cent at $10.66, iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources losing 5 per cent to $58.02 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold falling 4.3 per cent to $70.04.The S&P 500 Energy sector was down 2.9 per cent, with oil companies Exxon falling 1.8 per cent to $60.39, Chevron declining 2.4 per cent to $77.13 and Conoco Phillips sliding 2.4 per cent to $55.51.Industrials were the biggest faller, with the S&P 500 Industrial sector down 3.4 per cent.

The second-biggest US department store chain also raised its earnings and sales forecasts for the year.

The S&P 500 materials sector suffered the sharpest fall in the index, dropping 1 per cent.Both Alcoa, the largest US aluminium producer, and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the world’s second-biggest copper producer, and Cliffs Natural Resources, the iron ore producer, fell after the Chinese data softened metal prices.Alcoa dropped 2.7 per cent to $11.35, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold fell 2 per cent to $73.21 and Cliffs Natural Resources sank 2 per cent to $61.23.Oil prices also fell after the news from China with knock-on effects for producers: ExxonMobil fell 0.8 per cent to $61.93, Conoco Phillips lost 0.8 per cent to $56.87 and Chevron slipped 0.3 per cent to $79.04.Nuance Communications, the speech recognition technology supplier, missed analysts’ estimates with third-quarter sales of $273.2m coming in below a consensus forecast of $301m even though profits beat expectations.

262;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-08-04T21:28:15Z;First Quantum escalates Congo dispute;The Canadian miner and World Bank allege asset expropriation;A prominent Canadian mining company and the World Bank escalated their legal challenge against Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday, as claims of asset expropriation continued to cloud the investment climate for the mineral-rich African country.First Quantum Minerals, listed in Toronto and London, said the Congo government had decided to sell off the company’s Kolwezi copper project. Government agents halted construction on the project in September, citing contractual violations that First Quantum disputed.First Quantum and its financing partners are challenging the government’s seizure of Kolwezi before the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.The government’s decision this week to liquidate Kolwezi or “transform the assets into cash”, according to the company’s translation of an official notice received on August 2, comes before the international court has ruled on the dispute.The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank’s for-profit lending arm, is a partner in Kolwezi alongside South Africa’s Industrial Development Corporation. They are co-claimants against the Congo government in the Kolwezi dispute. The World Bank, however, has been a significant lender to Congo.First Quantum claims it is the biggest taxpayer in Congo, as it runs Frontier, a large copper mine, and is developing several other projects. It has become a barometer of investment risk in Congo as the company’s fortunes continue to worsen there.In May Congo’s supreme court ruled that Sodimico, a state-owned company, had recovered its original exploration rights over the Frontier mine. The ruling’s implications were unclear and First Quantum was still producing copper at Frontier without interference. But the uncertainty led First Quantum to cut back capital expenditure at Frontier in the second quarter of this year.In the past year the company has diversified away from Congo, approving large investments in Australia, Finland and Zambia.The Sodimico decision amounted to an “orchestrated attack” on the company that was in “obvious retaliation” to its decision to take the Kolwezi dispute to international courts, First Quantum said in a statement in May.On Wednesday, the company said there was a “continuation of legal attacks”, adding that its lawyers were not notified of the hearing that resulted in the order to liquidate Kolwezi.Freeport-McMoRan, the US copper miner, said last month it had still not received a fully approved licence for its Tenke Fungurume copper mine in Congo. It stands to be the biggest international investment in Congo and negotiations over the licence have continued for three years. Tenke started producing copper last year.
263;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

268;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-05-14T05:01:06Z;US: Winners steer steady course through troughs and peaks;;The difficult task of picking stocks and estimating earnings was made that much more demanding last year with the US equity markets staging one of their sharpest turnrounds of recent times.Following a 39 per cent fall in 2008, the S&P 500 index ended last year 24 per cent higher and 65 per cent above its low in March.The US markets entered 2009 still reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street investment bank, in September 2008 and shocked by the scope of the government’s intervention in the financial system. Commentators were arguing that the financial world had entered a new era, a “new normal”.When asked what this new era might look like, most seemed certain only that the outlook was very uncertain.“It took a leap of faith to make stock recommendations while the world was melting down,” laughs Gabe Moreen, remembering the time. “One questions one’s sanity.”The leap of faith paid off for Mr Moreen, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, as his calls outperformed their benchmark by 26.4 per cent, ranking him the top US stock picker in this year’s StarMine awards.His most successful call last year was the year-long “buy” rating on Targa Resources Partners, a provider of midstream natural gas services, that gained 264 per cent over the period and outperformed its benchmark by 242 per cent.Similarly, his calls on DCP Midstream and MarkWest Energy outperformed their benchmarks by 204 per cent and 160 per cent respectively.Mr Moreen, who covers gas utilities and master limited partnership (MLP) stocks, says a combination of attractive underlying fundamentals, low exposure to commodities prices and relatively minor capital needs helped them weather the seizure in the capital markets. This persuaded him to recommend the stocks to his clients in late 2008, even as the equity markets were tumbling.Although Mr Moreen’s three most successful individual calls were all “buy” recommendations, he also had “sell” recommendations on a significant number of stocks in his ratings distribution.With the markets rallying as much as they did last year, it is perhaps a little counterintuitive to see this, notes William Herkelrath, director of research proposition at Thomson Reuters whose subsidiary StarMine compiles the rankings.But, he says: “You couldn’t win the award by just being indiscriminately bullish last year. You had to differentiate, have a mix and find names that would go down as well as up.”A similar logic is evident at the broker level. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts won more stock picking awards in the US this year than analysts from any other broker, while having a higher proportion of “underperform” recommendations than any other bulge-bracket broker.Peter Ward, who took second place in StarMine’s overall stock-picker rankings and was its number one stock picker in the metals and mining sector, says his 16 years in equity research were crucial to outperforming his benchmark by 24.8 per cent.“Prediction is a very humbling occupation and everyone makes mistakes. Through experience, you learn not to repeat a lot of them,” says Mr Ward, a metals and mining analyst at Barclays Capital, formerly at Lehman Brothers.His most profitable call was a year-long “overweight/positive” on Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold , which outperformed its benchmark by 171 per cent.“We have long had an above-consensus bullish view on copper,” he says. “We felt there was far too much of a sceptical outlook for copper discounted in the share price.”Happily for his clients, copper was one of the year’s best performing commodities, with its price more than doubling, and Freeport’s stock price soaring 229 per cent higher.Barclays Capital has the distinction of being the only broker with more than one top-10 rated stock picker.Jim Harmon, who has covered energy stocks for almost 20 years and was also formerly at Lehman, won seventh place and was the top rated stock picker in the gas utilities sector.Extensive experience and breadth of perspective are crucial, says Mr Harmin, whose team has covered the diversified natural gas sector since 1991.Mr Harmon says: “Over this period, we have seen economic, energy price and regulatory cycles giving what we believe to be a broad backdrop to make valuation comparisons and relate them to cyclical events.”His most successful call last year was a year-long “underweight/neutral” recommendation on Piedemont Natural Gas, which underperformed its peers by 42 per cent.Given that the Top 10 stock pickers list is dominated by analysts covering commodities-related stocks, Lauren Torres’ third place particularly stands out. Covering the global beverage sector at HSBC, last year she outperformed her benchmark by 21.4 per cent and was number one ranked stock picker in the beverage sector in the US.Ms Torres, who has covered the sector since 2002, says: “I think there is a lot of opportunity for growth in the sector, particularly when looking by region. The consumer was actually quite strong in some countries last year.”One of those countries was Brazil, where AmBev, a beer and drinks group and Pepsi distributor, holds a dominant market position.“AmBev was in the right market, had the right brands and was managing costs effectively. We saw a good opportunity in terms of relative valuation,” Ms Torres says. She had a year-long “overweight” rating on the stock, which outperformed its benchmark by 109 per cent.The highest ranked analyst from a small brokerage was Michael Ward of Soleil-Ward Transportation Research, who covers auto and auto component stocks. He came fifth overall, having outperformed his benchmark by 19.1 per cent.Simon Leopold, who covers telecommunications equipment stocks at Morgan Keegan, was the highest rated earnings estimator overall in the US, as well as in his sector. He spent 12 years in the telecommunications industry before becoming an equities analyst.The accuracy of Piper Jaffray’s Bob Napoli in analysing financial stocks won him three top spots this year – the number one stock picker and earnings estimator in consumer finance, as well as the number one stock picker in diversified commercial services.“This is remarkable, given the sheer number of analysts that compete in this space and the overall interest level that the finance space tends to command in the market,” says Mr Herkelrath.Lasan Johong at RBC Capital Markets also stood out for his dominance in the independent power producers and energy traders sector, coming first in the earnings accuracy and stock picking categories.

It topped average analyst expectations of 45 cents per share.Intel, the microchip maker, rose 3.6 per cent to $23.09 after a bullish investor day on Tuesday.The company said it expected to double its earnings in the next few years as it pushes into new fast-growing segments, namely smartphones and TVs. Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, also said he was “highly confident” that it would achieve its financial goals for the current quarter.Electronic Arts retreated 5.8 per cent to $17.71, making it one of the day’s biggest fallers, after the video game company lowered its first-quarter and full-year outlook for 2011 in a restatement, disappointing some investors who had expected a rise.Pharma group Merck was 0.4 per cent higher at $33.64 after its annual research and development briefing day. “Merck remains our top pick in US major pharma [sector], given relative valuation, strong pipeline, and near-term synergy potential,” said Anthony Butler, an analyst at Barclays Capital. “We would be buyers at these levels.”Industrials stocks performed well across the sector. Caterpillar, which makes construction and mining equipment, was up 3.2 per cent to $68.15 and Deere & Co, the maker of agricultural equipment rallied 2.8 per cent to $61.14.Consumer staples stocks were higher.

271;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Copper touches new high after Chilean quake;Spike may be short-lived since key mines undamaged;Copper prices reached a 1½-month high on Monday after the earthquake in Chile, the world’s largest producer of the metal, but mining executives and analysts said the spike would be short-lived as key mines were undamaged.Copper inventories are near a six-year high, helping to cushion the market against any short-term supply disruption.Kevin Norrish, a metals analyst at Barclays Capital in London, said that, although the massive earthquake had clearly created a humanitarian crisis, “the impact in terms of its effect on copper production and exports appears likely to be less significant”.He said: “Most major mines were undamaged and, while there is some uncertainty over disruption to power and transport infrastructure, the main mining areas and copper ports appear to be safe.”Investors bought copper heavily in early trading.On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three months’ time rose 5.6 per cent to $7,600 a tonne, the highest level since mid-January. It later pared gains to trade 2.5 per cent up on the day at $7,405.The earthquake hit four medium-sized copper mines in the centre of the country owned by Codelco, the state company, and Anglo American with a combined production of about 20 per cent of Chile’s regular output.The country last year produced about 5.3m tonnes of refined copper, a third of global output, according to the US Geological Survey.Allison Nathan, a commodities analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York, said the disruptions were likely to be “short-lived at this point”.But she warned that “the potential for electricity repairs to take longer than these initial estimates poses . . . an upside risk to prices”.Codelco, the state-owned company, halted production at its El Teniente and Andina mines, while Anglo-American stopped activity at Los Bronces and El Soldado. Both companies said production was slowly restarting. Miners BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Freeport-McMoRan did not report any damage to their operations in the north.Chile is also a big producer of molybdenum, a by-product of copper mining used in steel super-alloys. The recently introduced LME’s molybdenum contract on Monday surged 5 per cent to $42,000 a tonne.Oil prices reacted to conflicting views on global oil demand. Nymex April West Texas Intermediate rose 16 cents but settled at $78.70 a barrel, down 96 cents on the day. ICE April Brent closed 70 cents lower $76.89.In soft commodities, frozen concentrate of orange juice hit a two-year high on the back of fears of a lower crop in Florida due to cold weather. ICE April FOCJ rose 4.8 per cent to $1.505 cents per pound, the highest since December 2007.Sugar prices extended their fall on buyers delaying purchases and the arrival of a fresh crop from Brazil, the world’s largest exporter. ICE May raw sugar fell 5.2 per cent to 22.37 cents a pound, the lowest level in three months. Sugar prices have sunk 25 per cent since they hit a 29-year high above 30 cents in January.Gold prices moved higher in dollar terms with bullion trading in London at $1,120 a troy ounce. In sterling terms, bullion hit an all-time high of £753.69 and traded near a record high in euro terms at €830.

Wage and salary incomes improved in January but overall personal income increased only 0.1 per cent because dividend income, farm income and interest income all took a hit.”Manufacturing expanded in February for a seventh consecutive month, although by less than expected, suggesting that US factories are leading the recovery. The ISM index fell to 56.5 from 58.4 in January.After the close, the S&P 500 was 1 per cent higher to 1,115.71, inching above 1,115, a technical level traders focus on. The index is 0.05 per cent higher since the start of the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 10,403.79, and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.6 per cent higher at 2,273.57.Insurance giant AIG advanced 4.1 per cent to $25.78 after Prudential, a UK life insurer, agreed to buy its Asian operations for $35.5bn in cash and shares.AIG, which is 80 per cent owned by US taxpayers, had planned a $10bn-$20bn partial listing of AIG on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange but scrapped the idea in favour of a trade sale to Prudential.Millipore rose 11.1 per cent to $104.90 on news that Merck KGaA, a German pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, had agreed to buy the US laboratory supplies maker for $7.2bn, including net debt. It trumps a $6bn approach by Thermo Fisher, a rival US company, and represents a 50 per cent premium to Millipore’s earlier share price. Thermo Fisher was 0.3 down to $48.65.OSI Pharmaceuticals surged 51.9 per cent to $56.25 after Astellas Pharma, Japan’s second-largest drugmaker, said it was about to begin a $3.5bn hostile takeover for the company. The bid values OSI at $52 per share in cash. Some traders are expecting a higher offer and potentially a bidding war.RiskMetrics Group rose 13.2 per cent to $21.09 after the risk advisory group was bought by MSCI Inc, a US investment analysis and market index company, in a $1.55bn cash and stock transaction. Shares in MSCI fell 4.6 per cent to $28.59.Miner Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold was up 1.7 per cent to $76.45 on the first trading day after the weekend’s earthquake in Chile, the world’s leading copper producer.

273;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-03-01T03:43:38Z;Copper futures surge on quake fears;;Copper futures rose as much as 5 per cent to a five-week high early on Monday after a massive earthquake in top producer Chile sparked supply worries but prices soon retreated.Three-month copper contracts on the London Metal Exchange rose 3.3 per cent to $7,435 a tonne by 01:53 GMT, after reaching $7,600 earlier, according to Reuters. Shanghai’s benchmark third-month copper contracts were trading 3.8 per cent higher at Rmb60,250 ($8,826) a tonne after hitting the 5 per cent daily limit.Analysts said global copper inventories were near a six-year high, which helped to cushion the market against any short-term supply disruption.The earthquake hit several medium-sized mines in the centre of the country. Codelco, the state-owned company, halted production at its El Teniente and Andina mines, while Anglo American stopped activity at Los Bronces and El Soldado.Executives at Codelco on Sunday said they were hoping to re-start production in the short-term after minimal damage, but Anglo American said its two affected mines were “currently without power following the earthquake”.The combined production of the four mines equals to about 20 per cent of the country’s regular production. Chile produced about 5.3m tonnes of refined copper last year, just below a third of global output, according to the US Geological Survey. On top of copper, Chile is a large exporter of other metals, including molybdenum.Chile’s giant copper mines were spared from significant damage as they are situated in the Atacama desert far to the north of the quake’s epicentre. Escondida, the world’s largest copper mine, is more than 1,000km to the north of Santiago, Chile’s capital, while the epicentre was registered about 70km to the south of the capital.Copper miners BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold did not report any significant damage to their large operations in the north.Santiago Gónzalez, Chile’s mining minister, said that the country’s copper exports would be unaffected. “Export commitments are going to be honoured,” he told local media, explaining that Chile had enough stocks of the red metal to cushion any disruption. The country’s top copper port, in Antofagasta, was on Sunday operating normally and there were not reports of road damage in the north of the country.Mr Gónzalez added that the mines closed will reopen “shortly”, although he did not provide a time-table for the re-start of the production.But analysts said road damage and power outages could still affect the country’s copper exports. One executive said the quake could also trigger precautionary buying. Copper prices climbed last week to $7,100 a tonne, having recovered from less than $4,000 in early 2009. Even after Monday’s gains, however, they remained far below the all-time high of more than $8,500 a tonne set in mid-2008.
274;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-02-21T19:15:35Z;LME to launch minor metals contracts;Price of cobalt and molybdenum has gyrated wildly;The London Metal Exchange will deepen its reach on Monday by launching derivatives contracts on cobalt and molybdenum, two minor metals used on daily goods such as mobile phones and whose price has wildly gyrated.The introduction comes as investors’ appetite for commodities increases as strong consumption in China pushes up the price of metals from aluminium to copper.The LME, the world’s largest metals exchange, nonetheless faces an uphill battle to convince the industry and the investors to use the new contracts after its most recent expansion attempt, into plastic and steel derivatives, largely failed.“We will take a ‘wait and see’ attitude until we see if liquidity builds,” said a senior minor metals trader, echoing a view largely held in the market. Several leading companies, including Codelco, the Chilean producer, and US-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, have indicated they will not use the contracts initially. The attitude of Glencore, the world’s largest trading house, will be crucial due to its dominance in the cobalt market, rival metal traders said.The LME is confident that the cobalt and molybdenum derivatives will gain traction because both minor metals are by-products of mining copper and nickel, two metals already traded on the exchange. In addition, the wild price volatility observed since 2005 could also entice traders to hedge their price risk on the exchange.“There has been incredible volatility in cobalt and molybdenum prices in recent years,” said Chris Evans, head of business development at the LME.“There is a tangible need for a terminal market to hedge price risk. Industry will also benefit from a transparent price discovered on a regulated exchange,” he added.The cost of molybdenum has risen to a year high of $16.5 per pound, up from $8 per pound last year, but still sharply below the $34 a pound peak set in 2008. The metal is used in super-alloys to enhance strength, heat and corrosion resistance.Cobalt is trading at about $22 a pound, down from more than $50 in early 2008. The metal, a by-product of copper and nickel mining, is used in mobile phone’s rechargeable batteries and super-alloys, in particular for the aerospace industry.The launch of the derivatives comes as commodities trading moves from the private, bilateral over-the-counter market into exchanges, where traders can offset the risk of default of their counterparties. Martin Abbot, chief executive at the LME, said that the global economic downturn has highlighted “how exchange trading and clearing bring more transparency and security” to financial markets.The launch is a test for the LME’s ambition to push deeper into other minor metals, freight derivatives or even precious metals. The exchange’s ambitions is to widen its business, so far centred in aluminium, copper, zinc, lead, nickel and tin.Additional reporting by Chris Flood
275;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-02-02T19:53:18Z;Rio fuels Footsie’s third successive rise;;Miners provided the foundation for the FTSE 100 to rally on Tuesday as the London market moved higher for a third session.Rio Tinto was among the top performers after Citigroup said the company would be sitting on surplus cash by next year.Asset sales and cash flow from operations would cut Rio’s debt from $42bn in 2008 to about $7bn by the end of 2010, while payments relating to the group’s iron ore partnership with BHP Billiton could provide another $4bn, Citi said.“From being on the brink in 2009 to having a surplus of cash in 2011 is a stunning turnround,” said Johan Rode, an analyst, who added Rio to the Citi “buy” list. His upgrade follows rumours that Rio may look at acquisitions, with US joint venture partner Freeport-McMoRan among the suggested targets.But Citi argued that a large acquisition looked unlikely while “management are still earning their M&A stripes”. The broker saw the cash as more likely to continue accelerating growth projects, dividends and potentially a share buy-back.Rio closed up 3.4 per cent at £32.91, matching a buoyant mining sector that accounted for more than half the Footsie’s gain.A weaker dollar and firmer metals prices lifted ENRC to the top of the blue-chip leaderboard, up 4.6 per cent to 977p. Kazakhmys rose 3.9 per cent to £13.31 and Xstrata rose 3.4 per cent to £10.96. BHP was up 2.7 per cent at £19.47.Anglo American climbed 3.2 per cent to £24.56 after both UBS and Société Générale upgraded to “buy” on valuation grounds.The FTSE 100 rose 35.90, or 0.7 per cent, to 5,283.31. That was in spite of BP taking 16.5 points off the index as its shares fell 3.8 per cent to 572p in reaction to quarterly earnings that missed expectations.Amec rose 4.5 per cent to 785½p, helped by a Cazenove note that set a £11.82 target price for the engineering consultancy’s stock.Cazenove argued in an oil sector note that Amec was pricing in zero earnings growth this year and next. But cost cutting had delivered growth last year and left the group well positioned to capitalise on recovering demand, it said.Whitbread moved 2.3 per cent higher to £14.43 amid a revival of gossip that the pubs, restaurants and hotels group could be targeted by Starwood Capital, the US real estate investment group.Defensive sectors led the fallers, with drinks can maker Rexam drifting 0.6 per cent to 298p in spite of better-than-expected results from its closest peer, Crown Holdings.Reckitt Benkiser was down 0.6 per cent to £32.33 on the back of a downgrade from Credit Suisse to “neutral”. Reckitt’s growth was slowing, with the household products division “all but stopped” by increased competition, sluggish markets and a reluctance among consumers to trade up, said the broker. With upgrades unlikely in 2010, Reckitt looked expensive against peers, it said.Among the mid-caps, the mortgage lender Paragon jumped 9.1 per cent to 153p following a post-results roadshow and on hopes that it will reopen its lending book this year.Traders linked the move to news that Lloyds Banking Group’s latest issue of residential mortgage-backed securities had attracted strong demand, particularly from US investors.Lloyds closed 2.6 per cent higher at 54¼p, matching a rally among the banks.The takeover candidate Shanks fell 2.3 per cent to 124p after warning that 2009 profit would be slightly below previous expectations. The waste management company added that “confidential discussions” were taking place with a buyer.Pub operators gained following an upbeat investor conference hosted by Merrill Lynch. Enterprise Inns – which Merrill said could restart a dividend in 2010 – was up 4.9 per cent to 127¼p and Punch Taverns gained 3.4 per cent to 87¼p.Evolution Group slid 1.6 per cent to 121½p amid rumours that the head of its securities division had resigned. A share placing may also have weighed on Evolution, dealers said, with some reckoning the last of a 10 per cent stake previously held by Banco Espirito Santo de Investimento was being sold.Petroceltic added 8.3 per cent to 13p on the back of another positive drilling report from one of its wells in Algeria, write Neil Hume and Bryce Elder.In response, Mirabaud Securities said it believed Petroceltic had written to Sonatrach, the Algerian state oil company, to request permission to show the data to other operators with a view to seeking a partner for its licence.Petroceltic’s previous partner, Spanish utility company Iberdrola, terminated its relationship with the company last month and placed its 15.7 per cent stake on the market.“Given the successful results of the recent drilling programme, we believe that there will be significant industry interest in the asset,” said Mirabaud.Songbird Estates rose 3.5 per cent to 169¾p amid rumours of stakebuilding. Evolution Securities started coverage of the property company, which owns most of Canary Wharf, with a “buy” recommendation and 185p target price.“Songbird is a unique company in the sector,” said Evolution. “It is a virtually pure play on central London offices with heavy exposure to financial markets.”Property agent Knight Frank said it expected office rents in the City to rise 19 per cent this year.Some traders think Songbird could be a takeover target for overseas investors. The Qatar Investment Authority owns a 24 per cent holding.MBL added 3.6 per cent to 185½p after winning a contract to supply all of WH Smith’s 450 high street stores with DVDs and Blue Ray discs.There was heavy trading in European Nickel, up 4.3 per cent to 7¼p, as it raised £12m by way of an equity placing at 7p a share.The cash is needed because approval for a $20m financing deal for its flagship mine in Turkey has been delayed.Separately, the company announced an all-share offer for Rusina Mining, up 7 per cent to 5¾p.
276;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-01-28T17:05:19Z;Pubs are rare bright spot for FTSE;;"Pub operators provided a rare bright spot Thursday as the FTSE 100 slipped to its lowest level in nearly two months.Enterprise Inns and Punch Taverns were in demand after Merrill Lynch said the industry outlook was becoming more favourable and stocks looked cheap against net asset value.“With fears over debt, regulation and property having eased, the focus is on trading,” said Lena Thakkar, an analyst. “A recovery could come faster than anticipated, with an economic upturn and a boost from the World Cup.”Merrill’s team argued that, with pub stocks having pared gains in the last four months of 2009, the sector is back where it was a year ago. Yet consumer sentiment is improving, property prices have steadied and economic growth is forecast to rally by 4.2 per cent this year, it said.The broker’s top picks were Punch, up 2.6 per cent to 94¾p, and Enterprise, firmer by 3 per cent to 117½p.Both are trading more than 60 per cent below net asset value, reflecting concerns over their business models and pub valuations that are not justified, Merrill said.The wider market chased Wall Street sharply lower, with the FTSE 100 erasing a 1.2 per cent gain to end down 1.4 per cent, or 71.73 points lower, at 5,145.7.The index has declined six times over the past seven sessions, losing 6.7 per cent, its worst run since last March.Lenders matched the trend, with the sector falling to a six-month low after Standard & Poor’s reiterated its view that the UK is not among the most stable banking systems. Barclays was 0.7 per cent adrift at 265p, while HSBC fell 0.5 per cent to 660p and Royal Bank of Scotland was off 1.3 per cent to 32½p.Lloyds Banking Group lost 0.2 per cent to 50¾p, having earlier peaked at 52¾p following “buy” advice from Deutsche Bank.Low rates and a buoyant UK property market should help Lloyds loan losses and wholesale funding, the broker said. However, it warned that volatility may follow the bank’s exchange of £1.5bn in hybrid debt for new equity next month, which will require nearly 3bn shares to be issued.Miners were the biggest drag on the Footsie as the winding down of central bank stimulus supported the dollar and pressured metals prices. Xstrata dropped 4.3 per cent to £10.04½, Antofagasta was 3.9 per cent lower at 885½p and Kazakhmys lost 3.1 per cent to £12.26.BHP Billiton was down 2.4 per cent to £18.42½ after making a small potash acquisition in Saskatchewan, Canada. Merrill Lynch argued that the deal underlined BHP’s interest in the area and saw larger targets, such as Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.Rio Tinto was also the subject of deal speculation, with the group mooted as a potential bidder for US peer Freeport McMoran.Rio closed lower by 2.4 per cent to £30.53½. However, given Rio’s stretched balance sheet and the controversy surrounding its Indonesian joint venture with Freeport, analysts were sceptical of the tale.AstraZeneca led the blue-chip fallers, down 4.6 per cent to £29.05, after its annual earnings missed forecasts.Among the gainers, Carnival took on 1.6 per cent to £22.72 after better-than-expected results from its main rival, Royal Caribbean, which said demand was picking up.Car insurers climbed after the AA said the average private motor premium rose 9 per cent in the fourth quarter, the strongest growth since the survey began in 1994. RSA Insurance was up 0.9 per cent to 129p and Admiral gained 0.4 per cent to £11.26.Bus companies were in focus among the mid-caps after Arriva said it was in preliminary talks to merge with Keolis, the French public transport operator.Arriva closed up 2.9 per cent to 481½p and National Express added 3.2 per cent to 212p. But traders noted that a deal could cause problems for Go-Ahead, down 0.3 per cent to £13.55; Keolis currently holds 35 per cent of Govia, Go-Ahead’s rail business.Premier Foods rose 1.7 per cent to 32½p after a block of 50m shares changed hands, about 2 per cent of the total.Xcite Energy was in demand yesterday, rising 8.7 per cent to 50p on news of a supply and financing agreement with BP for its flagship asset.Xcite owns the Bentley heavy oil field, which is one of the largest undeveloped fields of the UK continental shelf. If the company is able to convert the resource base of viscous oil into reserves, Xcite would become the third-largest oil company active in the North Sea, according to analysts.“This is a very positive step for the company, which has now attracted two very strong partners [Fugro, and now BP] to commercialise the field, said Dougie Youngson of Arbuthnot Securities. “The announcement de-risks the development phase of the project and also enhances its economics as the heavy oil discount should be reduced.”Jubilee Platinum was in focus amid speculation the mining company was sounding out investors over a possible £30m equity fundraising. The talk in the market was that the cash could be used to help Jubilee raise its stake in the Tjate project or two prospects in the western Bushveld in South Africa. Jubilee rose 4.8 per cent to 38¼p.Stockbroker Arden Partners held steady at 107½p after reporting annual results that showed an improvement in profitability during the second half of 2009 and a cash position of £10.5m.Ark Therapeutics slipped 4.9 per cent to 15¼p after the company put development of Vitor, a drug used to treat muscle-wastage in cancer, on hold and launched a restructuring programme.KBC Peel Hunt welcomed the decision by Ark to focus on its key assets – a gene-based medicine business. “The company will undertake an extensive restructuring to preserve cash until 2011. We acknowledge these changes and upgrade to ‘hold’,” said KBC.JJB Sports fell 4.6 per cent to 20½p after a disappointing trading statement."
277;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2010-01-13T19:51:37Z;Investor appetite drives gold to new peak;;Investors bought more gold than buyers of jewellery for the first time in three decades in 2009, highlighting the increasing impact of speculators on bullion prices.GFMS, the consultancy that compiles benchmark supply and demand data on the metal, said investment demand doubled to 1,820 tonnes last year, while jewellery purchases fell 23 per cent to 1,687 tonnes, a 21-year low.The data provide the clearest indication of the huge role investors played in driving gold to a record high of $1,226.10 a troy ounce in December.Philip Klapwijk, GFMS executive chairman, said he sensed that a “large amount of money” was poised to enter the gold market this year. He predicted a “bumpy” return to record prices by the summer on the back of loose fiscal and monetary policies and US dollar weakness.He warned that although investors could buy more gold this year, the market would become “increasingly vulnerable” to a severe correction when the circumstances favouring investment disappeared.He said: “As the macroeconomic environment gradually normalises, the gold market’s dependence on investment will become all too apparent with a substantial price retreat at that point on the cards”.The surge in gold prices, from $250 an ounce in 1999 to last year’s record, have depressed jewellery sales, traditionally the backbone of consumption. Gold was trading on Wednesday at $1,128 a troy ounce.The global economic crisis has also affected demand, particularly in India, the world’s largest buyer.GFMS said jewellery demand had fallen by almost half since reaching a peak of 3,294 tonnes in 1997. Traders said gold prices needed to drop below $1,000 an ounce to ensure a revival in jewellery demand, as the currencies of some key consuming countries, such as India and Turkey, depreciated against the dollar, increasing the local cost of bullion.On the supply side, China cemented its position as the world’s biggest gold producer. A further fall in South Africa’s output, down 5 per cent on the year, saw it relegated to third position behind Australia. It had been the top producer for more than a century until 2007.Global mine supply rose 6 per cent to 2,553 tones, a six-year high, helped by a large jump in output from Indonesia, up 55 per cent to 146 tonnes following a recovery in production at Grasberg in Indonesia, the world’s largest gold mine, jointly owned by Freeport-McMoRan.GFMS said it expected mine supply to continue to rise in the first half of 2010, helped by a number of new projects that have entered production.However, the most significant supply side change last year was the rise in scrap gold supply, up more than 26 per cent to a record 1,541 tonnes, as consumers recycled unwanted jewellery in unprecedented quantities.GFMS said that further growth in scrap supply might be possible but the consultancy noted that industry contacts had started talking about the possible depletion of near-market supplies.Net sales from central banks dropped 90 per cent to 24 tonnes in 2009, the lowest level in more than two decades.
278;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-12-29T21:44:15Z;Slide in energy stocks halts Wall St rally;;"Wall Street broke its six-day winning streak on Tuesday after the stronger dollar dragged energy stocks lower.The market spent most of the morning in positive territory and was poised to record its longest period of gains since October 2006.But a burst of strength in the dollar just before midday dragged the S&P 500 energy sector down 0.7 per cent, pushing Wall Street in and out of the red in the afternoon.Retailers had initially lifted the market after data from the International Council of Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs showed like-for-like sales across the sector were up 2.3 per cent last week from the same period a year ago.A December reading of consumer confidence was also better than expected.Shares in Amazon.com edged 0.1 per cent higher to $139.41 after two brokerages raised their price targets for the online retailer.Kaufman Bros raised its target from $120 a share to $155, while Piper Jaffray raised its target to $172 from $163, giving the stock an “overweight” rating.Over the weekend, Amazon announced that on Christmas day its customers had bought more Kindle digital books than physical books for the first time.After hitting a 15-month high on Monday, the S&P 500 eventually closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,126.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 10,545.41 and the Nasdaq was down 0.1 per cent at 2,288.40.“This recovery rally appears to have run out of steam and we may be entering an extended consolidation period,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.Since the market’s lows in March, the S&P is up more than 65 per cent.Mining companies also pushed the market higher in early trading after copper rose to a 15-month high following a strike at the world’s second-largest mine. Workers at the Chuquicamata mine in Chile are protesting over pay. Xstrata has cut output at the facility for nearly a month to finish maintenance work. However, the stronger dollar weighed on commodity-based stocks later in the day and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 0.9 per cent to $81.09.Housebuilders suffered after data showed that US home prices were broadly flat in October following five months of solid gains.Some analysts suggested house prices could be heading for a “double-dip”. KB Home dropped 0.2 per cent to $13.80, while Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder, lost 0.8 per cent to $18.82.But Pulte Homes, the country’s largest homebuilder, gained 1 per cent to $9.97.In the pharmaceutical sector, shares in Vivus lost 4 per cent to $9.28 after the company submitted an application to regulators for Qnexa, a drug designed to fight obesity. The announcement came a week after rival Arena Pharmaceuticals also filed an application for an obesity drug. Arena shares were down 2.2 per cent at $3.52.Arigene, a South Korean manufacturer of medical equipment, withdrew its offer to buy Trimeris having failed to raise enough capital to complete the deal. Shares in Trimeris, which makes the HIV drug Fuzeon, plunged 16.7 per cent to $2.65.AspenBio Pharma rallied 15.4 per cent to $1.80 after the biotechnology company announced it was commencing analysis on AppyScore, a test for appendicitis.In August, US regulators denied the group marketing approval, saying it had not provided enough data. The drugmaker said it expected to meet the US Food and Drug Administration in January.UnitedHealth, the leading US healthcare operator, was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” by analysts at Standpoint Research, who cited low growth prospects and the lack of a dividend. The shares dropped 1.7 per cent to $30.85.Sterling Bancshares the Houston-based lender, abandoned its plans to buy
First Banks’ branches in Texas before the end of the year because it had taken too long to gain regulatory approval. Sterling shares gained 3.1 per cent to $5.41.Potash Corp of Saskatchewan, the largest maker of fertiliser, lost 2 per cent to $109.50 after Renaissance Capital said that potash prices could decline next year.Last week, OAO Uralkali, the Russian potash producer, signed a contract to supply China with as much as 1.2m tonnes of the fertiliser."
279;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-12-28T22:36:09Z;Wall Street hits high for year;;US equity benchmarks rose modestly on Monday and closed at highs for the year, and offset lower airline and financial stocks.After the benchmark opened in positive territory and rose as much as 0.4 per cent to a new intra-day peak for 2009, the S&P closed up 0.1 per cent at 1,127.78.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 10,547.08, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 2,291.08, both closing highs for the year.After their opening rally, stocks trimmed some strength as investors turned wary of pushing the market too far in the final week of the year, a time of thin liquidity and low volumes.Among leading S&P sectors, telecoms and health care stood out, while energy faded some of its early gains. Financials lagged the broad market as a further rise in Treasury yields and a move by the Federal Reserve to offer term deposits for bank reserves weighed on sentiment.Monday’s rally leaves the market at its highest levels since October 2008, and the S&P is just shy of a 25 per cent gain for 2009, on course for its best year since 2003’s gain of 26 per cent. But, worries about next year loiter on the horizon, said analysts.“While one can sense more comfort about the near-term economic and earnings data, long-term issues are the primary factors generating investment community discomfort,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi.“Yawning deficits, more substantive government involvement in business decisions, credit constraint and poor historical equity returns all are contributing to the feelings of unease that permeates the Street even as the near-death experience fears have backed off considerably.”Since plumbing depths in March, the S&P 500 has rebounded 66 per cent and entering 2010, the economic recovery and exit strategy of the Federal Reserve from its policy of zero interest rates and quantitative easing loom large as the big challenges facing investors.“The Fed is likely to be very careful to avoid tightening too much, and too soon, and risk undermining the recovery,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank.On Monday, investors were initially cheered by data from a unit of MasterCard that showed that sales at US retailers rose 3.6 per cent for the period from the start of November to Christmas Eve compared with the previous year. However, 2009 included an extra shopping day over 2008 and, excluding that, sales were only up 1 per cent.Shares in Amazon closed up 0.6 per cent at $139.31, after it reported that it sold more e-books than paper versions for the first time on Christmas Day.Among blue chips, IBM rose 1.3 per cent to $132.31 after Barron’s, the financial paper, said the company had significant room for growth and merited trading at a higher multiple.Shares in 3M gained 1.1 per cent to $83.45, while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Golderased an early rise of 2 per cent during trading, closing a fraction lower at $81.80.Other bluechips under pressure included: Walt Disney, down 1.2 per cent at $31.91, while American Express lost 1.5 per cent to $41.05 and Alcoa dropped 1.5 per cent to $16.10.One sector under pressure on Monday was airlines. The NYSE Arca airline index fell closed 1.8 per cent lower in the wake of an abortive attempt by a passenger to bomb a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit last Friday.Shares in Delta Airlines dropped 4.1 per cent to $11.29, while AMR Corp the parent of American Airlines, fell 4.8 per cent to $7.75 and United Airlines retreated 3.4 per cent at $12.64.By contrast, shares in L3 Communications, the maker of airport scanners, rose 1.4 per cent to $86.80.Meanwhile, shares in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac surged from penny stock levels. Fannie rose 21 per cent to $1.27 and Freddie was up 27 per cent at $1.60 after the US Treasury announced late last week that it will provide unlimited capital support beyond the already agreed $400bn to the mortgage giants over the next three years.
280;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-10-08T23:27:07Z;Freeport in standoff over copper mine;;Freeport-McMoRan, the US copper and gold miner is locked in a standoff with the Democratic Republic of Congo over its rights to one of the world’s richest untapped copper and cobalt deposits.The company, which has invested nearly $2bn bringing the Tenke Fungurume mine in Congo’s southern Katanga province to production, has been given until Monday to resolve a long-standing dispute over the terms of its licence, or risk losing it.The first phase of the Tenke Fungurume project is set to deliver 250m pounds of copper annually but is thought to have potential to expand into one of the most productive copper mines in the world.The outcome of the dispute is likely to have significant consequences for Freeport, the world’s largest listed copper miner. It could also determine Congo’s prospects for attracting other multinational miners at a time when Chinese companies are establishing a strong foothold in the country.“The entire mining industry and international financial community is watching intently to see how our contract is handled,” according to Richard Adkerson, chief executive of Freeport.He said the company has offered “economic concessions”, but these do not alter the economics of the original contract, which, like dozens signed during the country’s war and the transition that followed it, has been under review.According to Victor Kasongo, Congo’s deputy minister of mines, Freeport is resisting demands to increase the state’s stake and conform with the country’s mining code – a position that he claims puts it outside Congolese law.Freeport acquired a 57 per cent stake in the venture when it bought Phelps Dodge in 2007. Mr Adkerson said the company has a legally enforceable contract that was re-negotiated between 2003 and 2005 and was the basis for their $2bn investments.New demands include raising the equity in the venture of Gecamines, the state copper miner, from 17.5 to 45 per cent.“What they are asking for is to retrieve items they conceded in the 2003-2005 negotiations but keep the significant taxes and royalties we agreed to. You add that together and it really does not make economic sense,” he said. Billions of dollars of further investment in expanding the mine and upgrading road, rail and power infrastructure around it are at stake.The state stands to gain more than 50 per cent of the total value of the venture, Mr Adkerson added. “It is not in any way a sweetheart contract. It is fair and consistent with international standards,” he said.A deadline to agree terms more favourable to the state passed on Tuesday, but the government extended it amid tense negotiations.Mr Kasongo has succeeded in extracting upfront payments and improved state equity in a host of smaller ventures during the long review process he has overseen. But when Canada’s First Quantum refused to comply it had its licence revoked last month. It is now threatening to go to international arbitration.
281;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-10-05T17:34:53Z;Mining groups victim to African uncertainty;;A resurgence of antagonism between international mining companies and governments of some of Africa’s least developed countries is raising questions about the world’s future supply of industrial metals.Under the jungles of countries such as Guinea, where rampaging soldiers killed 157 demonstrators last week, and Congo, struggling to recover from civil war, lie some of the richest unexploited mineral deposits. Yet exploiting those deposits poses problems that scare off most of the companies best able to develop them.Traditional sources of metals – Australia, Chile, South Africa, Russia – still have abundant reserves. But as they are gradually exhausted, many in the industry believe Africa’s volatile mining frontiers will have to take over.But ensuring that lic­ences are secure is essential to protect the large-scale investments of companies such as Rio Tinto, the Anglo-Australian mining giant. That security shows no signs of improving in either Guinea or Congo – which are extraordinarily rich in copper, cobalt and diamonds.The story of Vancouver-based First Quantum Minerals is the latest warning. The Congo-focused miner halted construction on its $550m Kolwezi copper pro­ject on September 16 on government orders. The project had fallen behind schedule, the government claimed in an August letter to the company. The penalty, it said, was First Quantum handing over its 65 per cent interest to Gecamines, the state-owned mining company. Inter­national arbitration now looms.A similar issue is besetting Rusal, the Russian aluminium producer, in Guinea, which has the world’s largest deposits of bauxite, used to make aluminium. On September 10 a court in Guinea expropriated Rusal’s Friguia alumina refinery, the country’s biggest industrial project, ruling that Rusal bought it for an illegally low price in 2006 under a previous regime. Rusal has confirmed that it plans to pursue legal action to defend its “interests as the legitimate owner of the asset”.The Rusal dispute is the first to emerge from an “audit” of mining operations in Guinea undertaken by the junta headed by Moussa Dadis Camara, the army captain who took power in December following the death of the long-time dictator Lansana Conté and whose rule has become increasingly erratic.The audit follows a long-running dispute between Guinea and Rio Tinto over the rights to develop Simandou, one of the world’s richest undeveloped iron ore deposits. Claiming that Rio had taken 10 years too long to bring Simandou into production, Guinea handed over half of the concession to Beny Steinmetz Group, an Israeli-African diamond miner, in December.In all these cases investors were worried not so much by evidence of African resource nationalism – a constant over the past decade – or the state’s authority to press legal claims. The most problematic factor was the unpredictable, seemingly capricious application of the law.Under such conditions, it is impossible to be sure that a licence will not be re­voked because of the rise of a faction or minister or the death of a leader. Even if it is revoked, it is near impossible to determine how final the edict is. For Rio, such conditions still prevail at Simandou after investment of more than $400m (€274m, £251m) in sunk costs.Such uncertainties are overshadowing Tenke Fungurume, the enormous new copper mine in the Congo built by Freeport McMoran, the US miner. Freeport brought the project into production this year. But it and First Quantum are the last two companies not to reach agreement over new licence terms the Kinshasa government is trying to enforce, as a two-year review of mining licences draws to a close. Tuesday is Freeport’s deadline for agreeing new terms.The review started in 2007 as an attempt to clarify licences and accrue more mining revenues to the state, but it has ended as “a brilliant farce, if it were not such a tragedy”, an African mining executive said.“A number of companies agreed to increased upfront payments, but in the face of the economic slowdown even the short-term benefits are likely to prove illusory,” said Peter Rosenblum, a Columbia law school professor, in April. He was working there under the auspices of the Carter Centre, which ended its involvement in the review, citing the government’s failure to conduct it transparently.Despite the risks, investment in Africa’s mining frontiers has picked up. In July Randgold and Anglogold Ashanti, two of the continent’s biggest goldminers, jointly offered C$546m ($508m) for Moto Goldmines, owner of a huge undeveloped gold deposit in the Congo. On September 18 Eurasian Natural Resources Corp, the Kazakh miner, offered £584m ($931m) for Camec, the Congo-based copper and cobalt miner.Acknowledging the risks of such an investment, ENRC’s chief executive said the high quality of Camec’s Congo cobalt assets far outweighed the risks, especially given the “cheap” purchase price.As commodity prices rise, such calculations may become more common among mining companies needing to stake a claim on the dwindling number of high-quality, undeveloped metal deposits. But the rising price alone will not ensure that the metals get to markets.
282;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-08-26T20:23:16Z;Wall Street shrugs off mixed data;;"US stocks closed a whisker higher after a choppy day of trade on Wednesday as investors digested a mixed set of economic data.A disappointing reading on durable goods orders for July weighed on industrial stocks, which were the day’s weakest sector.Although the headline figure was encouraging, analysts focused on the number that excluded transportation, discounting the temporary effect of the government’s cash-for-clunkers programme.That data was worse than expected, which triggered widespread selling in the industrial sector.Caterpillar, the machinery maker, dropped 1.2 per cent to $47.25, while
Honeywell, the manufacturing conglomerate, lost 1.1 per cent to $37.12.General Electric was also caught up in the selling, in spite a new $2.7bn contract to build a power plant in Kuwait and reports of a possible $2bn sale of its security unit. The shares fell 1.3 per cent to $14.11.The early falls were mitigated by a sharp rise in monthly sales of new homes , which boosted the homebuilding sector.Lennar gained 4.1 per cent to $15.58 and DR Horton climbed 5.7 per cent to $13.79.The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all closed a fraction higher at 1,028.12, 9,543.52 and 2,024.43, respectively.That constituted the seventh successive positive session for the Dow.“Until it becomes clear that there is a sustainable economic trend you are going to see this kind of mixed data,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential.“More worrying is the fact that the markets have sold off towards the close recently.”Metals producers came off their recent highs as commodity prices dipped. Freeport-McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, lost 1.5 per cent to $63.13, while Nucor, which makes steel, fell 2.4 per cent to $45.28.“Commodity shares could find a headwind with Chinese stocks soft and crude oil finding resistance at $75,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Financial stocks were also lower in spite of the housing data as well as figures showing that mortgage applications rose last week, defying a rise in mortgage rates.Signs of stabilisation in the housing market have lifted banks to the forefront of the recent rally, but they slipped on Wednesday as investors took an opportunity to take profits off the table.Citigroup declined 2.5 per cent to $4.63 and JPMorgan lost 0.6 per cent to $43.30.Morgan Stanley drifted 2.2 per cent to $29.53, even as rumours intensified
surrounding the sale of its Van Kampen investment unit, with Bloomberg reporting that the bank has approached at least three other asset managers with offers of a possible partnership or sale.Retailers were higher during the day, building on the gains made during Tuesday on the back of an unexpectedly sharp rise in consumer confidence.Budget retailers were especially strong, carried by the momentum from the previous session, when Big Lots reported better earnings than expected.The company was one of Tuesday’s strongest performers and rose again on Wednesday morning, picking up 3 per cent to $26.37.Rival Family Dollar climbed 3.5 per cent to $30.82.Williams-Sonoma, the kitchenware retailer, jumped after it reported a surprise profit and said that tight inventory control would see it earn more over the year than previously forecast.The sharp cost cuts mitigated slumping sales at the company, which also owns the Pottery Barn furnishings chain, and the shares rose 11.3 per cent to $17.21.Health insurers suffered however, as analysts predicted that the death of Senator Edward Kennedy could provide further impetus to government plans to reform healthcare.They said the Democrats may want to honour the memory of one of the strongest advocates for such reform.With the current plan proposing cuts in government subsidies to large health insurers, Humana lost 2.7 per cent to $36.15, while UnitedHealth fell 3.3 per cent to $28.93."
283;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-08-26T17:14:22Z;Antofagasta positive over copper price;;Lower production volumes and falling copper prices have hit profits at Antofagasta, although the Chilean miner said that it would continue with plans to increase production by more than 50 per cent in the next two years amid tentative signs of a price recovery.“Commodity prices were much weaker in the first half compared with 2008,” said Marcelo Awad, chief executive.“However, commodity prices have rallied significantly in recent weeks, and should this hold, the second half of the year will clearly benefit the group.”In the first half of this year, the London-listed miner produced 218,200 tonnes of copper, down 7 per cent from the 233,600 tonnes it mined in the first half of 2008.Production of molybdenum, a hard metal used in steel alloys, was unchanged at 3,700 tonnes.The average copper price on the London Metals Exchange almost halved in the same period, from $8,034 per tonne to $4,091.However, by the end of June, prices had picked up again to $6,384 per tonne.Antofagasta is now forecasting full-year copper production of 447,000 tonnes.The miner is aiming to raise production to almost 700,000 tonnes by 2011, helped by new production coming onstream in Chile at a cost of $3.3bn (£2bn).For the six months ending June 30, pre-tax profit tumbled 71 per cent to $477m, on revenues that fell 51 per cent to $1.2bn.Earnings per share slumped 70 per cent from 80.4 cents to 23.9 cents and the group paid an interim dividend of 3.4 cents.That was down from 6.4 cents at the half-year stage the year before, when Antofagasta paid an additional 3 cents special dividend.Shares in Antofagasta on Wednesday fell 36p to close at 753 ½p.Antofagasta’s shares have surged more than 50 per cent since the start of the year as investors have been heartened by signs of copper restocking in China. The shares are now barely 10 per cent below the high reached in October 2007. However, the direction of future copper demand in the near term remains uncertain. For this reason, investors may find the stock already fully valued. It trades at about 23.5 times 2009 earnings, only slightly ahead of its copper-producing competitor Freeport-McMoran which is on 22.7 times prospective earnings, but well below more diversified operators such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, on 15 and 16 times forward earnings respectively.
284;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-08-21T20:27:50Z;Wall Street surges to record highs for year;;US stocks rallied to new highs for the year on Friday after early optimism from Europe was boosted by signs of a US recovery.An unexpected jump in the sales of existing homes fuelled the market’s best day since late July, which was initially sparked by figures showing the German manufacturing and service sectors expanded.This gave investors further confidence that the recession is ending, after figures earlier in the week showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region and manufacturing in the New York area both rose impressively last month.Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave those hopes further credence when he told a conference: “The prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good,” although he admitted such growth may be sluggish.“We have had good signs this week on manufacturing and housing, as well as in key export markets such as the eurozone,” said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. “But of course, we are still missing the consumer, and that is the big problem.”The European data helped oil rise to a price not seen since last October.This fed into energy stocks, with Chevron rising 1.6 per cent to $69.73 and ExxonMobil picking up 1.9 per cent to $69.92.Metals stocks also showed strength as they extended recent gains made on the back of firmer commodity prices. Freeport McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, advanced 4.6 per cent to $65.06. US Steel picked up 2.6 per cent to $44.86.Homebuilders then joined those sectors at the forefront of the buying after the housing data, with Lennarrising 3.2 per cent to $14.52 and DR Horton climbing 3.4 per cent to $12.66.Financial stocks continued their recent winning run, with Citigroup building further on the 66 per cent rise in its share price since late July with a gain of 4.9 per cent to $4.70.Bank of America rose 1.9 per cent to $17.46 and Wells Fargo climbed 1.7 per cent to $27.94.The rally took the benchmark S&P 500 to new closing highs for the year, up 1.9 per cent up at 1,026.13.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.7 per cent to 9,505.96 and the Nasdaq rose 1.6 per cent to 2,020.90.This put the gloss on what turned out to be a positive week for the stock market, which took the S&P 2.2 per cent higher, the Dow up 2 per cent and the Nasdaq 1.8 per cent better off.Friday marked the fourth straight positive session, following a sell-off on Monday after a big drop in Chinese equities.Wall Street soon gained its composure, however, with investors focusing on the positive economic news rather than more worrying data showing the number of people claiming jobless benefits unexpectedly rising.`“There has been a recent acceleration in the economic recovery, said Stanley Nabi, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management. “The question is, is this a temporary turnaround and will there be a relapse, or is this for real?”Companies also continued to report encouraging earnings, and clothing retailer Gap rose 3.3 per cent on Friday to $19.48 after investors shook off disappointing sales and focused on rising profits .JM Smucker, which produces jam and peanut butter, also beat estimates, helped by stronger sales and improving profit margins. Its shares rose 4.3 per cent to $54.10.Salesforce.com, which makes software for managing customer data, jumped after reporting stronger quarterly revenues than expected.Its shares rose 16.2 per cent to $53.67.But businesses are apparently less willing to buy tax preparation software, with Intuit, which produces such software, saying continuing economic weakness would mean lower full-year profits than previously forecast. The shares fell 7.2 per cent to $28.62.
285;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-08-19T20:43:31Z;Oil price rebound fuels Wall Street rally;;A sudden surge in the price of oil following data showing a huge drop in crude supplies last week pulled US stocks out of a slump on Wednesday to stage a broad-based rally.Wall Street suffered immediately after the open following overnight selling in Asia, which took China briefly into an official bear market.Worries about demand from that country weighed on commodity prices but the price of oil then bounced back, carrying energy producers with it.Chevron closed 1.8 per cent higher at $68.16, while ExxonMobil gained 2.3 per cent to $68.Metals prices followed oil upwards, as did shares in the metals producers. Freeport McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, rebounded from early losses to end 2.7 per cent higher at $62.09.However, Alcoa remained lower, pressured by a downgrade from Goldman Sachs, which said the price of aluminium could suffer as supply and demand become more transparent during an economic recovery. Its shares slid 3.4 per cent to $12.48.The rally took the benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index 0.7 per cent higher to 996.46, 9,279.16 and 1,969.24, respectively.“This is all because of oil. After the data, energy stocks took off and commodities followed them,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams.“But volumes are anaemic, and though the market might rally for the next two or three weeks, I don’t expect to see it continue when volume returns.”Hewlett-Packard missed out on the rally after it saw its quarterly sales plunge, and predicted only 8 per cent revenue growth in the next quarter, which is below current Wall Street estimates. This added to renewed concerns about the health of the US consumer, and HP’s shares fell 0.3 to $43.83.Todd Colvin, vice-president at MF Global, said: “We are at a pivot point now. But worries about the consumer will be the next negative to drag the markets lower. It is clear low spending will not go away.”Experts remained split on the state of the recovery, with Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, writing in the New York Times that the US economy was “out of the emergency room”.But Mr Buffett also warned that recovery would be slow, echoing recent concerns about how much consumers could spur economic improvement, with retail sales and consumer confidence both faltering.Data showing mortgage applications rose last week failed to spark a significant rally in financial stocks, although the large banks recovered after early falls.Citigroup shares drifted amid concerns about government involvement in bailed-out banks after a report in the Financial Times, which said regulators asked the company to dismiss Ned Kelly, its chief financial officer, just weeks before his surprise departure.The stock fell sharply in early trade but recovered some ground to finish 0.2 per cent down at $4.13.Deere & Co, the agricultural equipment maker, weighed on the industrial sector, in spite of beating estimates for both revenues and profit. The company warned of ongoing weakness in revenues, saying that the full-year drop in sales would be larger than previously forecast. It fell 2.9 per cent to $43.78.Homebuilders were also lower after an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus said recent gains made by DR Horton and luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers meant there was limited room for further rises. DR Horton lost 2.3 per cent to $11.94 while Toll Brothers dropped 1.4 per cent to $21.66.Health insurers, whose shares have been turbulent recently as the progress of healthcare reform has stuttered, endured a second straight session.Coventry Health Care lost 1.8 per cent to $22.57 and Cigna, whose shares were downgraded by Credit Suisse, fell 1.2 per cent to $29.12.CBS rose 5 per cent to $10.36 after UBS called it the “most attractive cyclical investment in media”.Elsewhere, La-Z-Boy, the maker of the iconic recliner, bounced 8 per cent to $8 after it swung to an unexpected quarterly profit as sales beat expectations.
286;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-08-17T18:47:48Z;Wall Street joins international slide;;"US stocks suffered their worst day since the beginning of July on Monday after the global sell-off triggered in Asia translated into heavy falls on Wall Street.Concerns over the health of the US consumer were at the forefront of investors’ minds after last week’s weak retail sales and consumer confidence figures sapped faith in this year’s rally in Asian equities.They were then exacerbated by worse-than- expected profit at Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, where sales saw the company miss its profit estimates and lower its full-year forecast.Its shares shed 10.3 per cent to $20.47 while rival Home Depot, which reports its results today, gave up 3.8 per cent to $26.11.The S&P 500 closed 2.4 per cent lower at 979.73. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2 per cent to 9,135.34 and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.8 per cent to 1,930.84.At the same time, volatility jumped, with the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility taken from options activity, rising 15 per cent to 27.90.“We shouldn’t expect to see the consumer out shopping yet but the market has got ahead of itself on this,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.Falling commodity prices also weighed on the markets after signs that the Chinese government may be slowing its stockpiling while lower quarterly growth than expected in Japan was another concern.Materials and energy stocks followed commodities lower.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, dropped 6.5 per cent to $12.41, and Freeport McMoRan, the copper and gold miner, lost 6.7 per cent to $59.36.In the energy sector Chevron dropped 2 per cent to $66.59 andExxon Mobilslid 2.4 per cent to $66.55.Technology companies, many of which rely on Asia for a significant proportion of their sales, also lost out.Intel, which makes 60 per cent of its sales in Asia, declined 1.7 per cent to $18.45 while IBM, where Asian sales make up 10 per cent of the total, was 1.4 per cent down at $116.86.IBM’s fall came in spite of news that the company may have found a way to use DNA to build microchips, which could be a cheaper option than current
methods.Dell, which is to work with China Mobile on a new smartphone handset for the Chinese market, fell 1.9 per cent to $13.93.“China has been a good leading indicator on growth - it led the markets up and now it might lead them down again,” said Mary Ann Bartels, technical research analyst at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.She added: “This is a normal correction. The number looks big but the rally was really big. We might yet see a pullback of between 10 and 15 per cent.”There was a broad flight from risky assets, which hit banking stocks hard. Bank of America lost 4.8 per cent to $16.56.Citigroup began the morning with heavy losses but clawed back some ground after saying its credit card write-offs fell last month. It ended 1 per cent down at $4.Shares in regional lender BB&T gave up 6.4 per cent to $26.43 after the company announced that it would sell $750m of shares to bolster its balance sheet following the purchase of Colonial, the failed Alabama bank.Health insurers bucked the trend, however, after signs over the weekend that the Obama administration might be willing to drop the public insurer element of its healthcare reform plans.Investors had worried a public insurer could undermine the private sector.But Kathleen Sibelius, secretary of health and human services, told CNN on Sunday that such an option was “not an essential element”.Coventry Health Care picked up 4.4 per cent to $23.60 while Aetna advanced 4.8 per cent to $29.63.Johnson & Johnson also showed resilience, falling only 0.4 per cent to $59.82 after Berkshire Hathaway, the group run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, increased its stake in the company.The investment group also took a stake in Becton Dickinson, which sells healthcare equipment, and its shares slipped only 0.1 per cent to $66.30."
287;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-08-14T20:39:05Z;Fall in confidence triggers Wall St sell-off;;"Late buying saw stocks avoid their worst day in a month, although weak data knocked confidence in the recovery and dragged equities to their first weekly loss in five.Several pieces of data came in below expectations during the last two sessions of the week, which combined to trigger the worst sell-off in more than a month on Friday.Worries about deflation added to poor consumer confidence and activity, leaving investors seeking safer assets than equities.Friday’s consumer price inflation figures, which showed the biggest year-on-year drop since 1949, saw inflation-sensitive sectors fall, with materials, industrial and energy stocks all doing badly.They were then joined by consumer discretionary shares after the University of Michigan’s consumer confidence index for August showed an unexpected drop.This followed disappointing retail sales figures on Thursday, which only failed to trigger a sell-off after the market was supported by the promise of growth in the eurozone.Stocks actually closed that session at record highs for the year. However, after gaining strongly on Thursday, materials led Friday’s selling.Alcoa, the aluminium company, lost 3.2 per cent to $13.27 while Freeportthe gold and copper miner, fell 3.7 per cent to $63.65.This saw the S&P close 0.9 per cent down at 1,004.09. It lost 0.6 per cent over the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.8 per cent to 9,321.40, a weekly drop of 0.5 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.2 per cent to 1,985.52, finishing the week 0.7 per cent lower.“We have had a string of better-than-expected data but over the past two days it has been very disappointing,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. “And we think the market will continue to be dictated by the direction of future economic data.”The falls in consumer stocks dragged two leading clothing retailers lower, even after they both raised full-year forecasts following their quarterly results.JC Penney lost ground in spite of making a narrower loss than expected. Its higher profit forecast remains at the lower end of analyst expectations and the stock declined 6.2 per cent to $31.29.Nordstrom also fell as its new forecast could not counteract slightly lower profit than expected.The shares gave up 6.4 per cent to $27.87. Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “People have assumed that the recovery will be consumer led. We have known for many months that that won’t be the case, but it is only just sinking in.”But Abercrombie & Fitch, which has suffered recently as cheaper competitors have eaten into its share of the teenage fashion market, bounced 3.9 per cent to $34.25. Its quarterly loss did not deter investors, who focused on some encouraging sales trends.Boeing slid further than the rest of the industrial sector after the company encountered fresh problems with its 787 Dreamliner aircraft.Boeing said it had stopped work on two parts of the fuselage but denied this would further delay the launch, which is already two years behind schedule. The shares fell 3.8 per cent to $44.87.Elsewhere, struggling DVD rental chain Blockbuster was one of the day’s heaviest fallers after it made a worse loss than expected on weak sales.The results forced
management to cut the full-year forecast and the shares shed 16.3 per cent to 72 cents.Autodesk the graphic design company, beat analysts’ estimates on slightly stronger revenues than expected, which were particularly strong in Asia-Pacific and emerging countries. Its shares rose 4.9 per cent to $25.38."
288;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-08-13T21:24:52Z;Wall Street hits new highs for the year;;US stocks reluctantly joined the global equity rally on Thursday, staggering to new highs for the year after weak economic data hampered what could have been a stellar day of trade.Results from Wal-Mart added to pre-market optimism sparked by the unexpected return to growth in France and Germany.But the news that retail sales for July unexpectedly declined, while the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time last week rose, kept the lid on any major rally.“Retail sales were very disappointing,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “Consumption makes up 60-70 per cent of GDP, so a dive in consumption is more important than growth elsewhere.”But the promise of global growth meant equities rallied towards the close, ending in positive territory after a choppy day of trade.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.7 per cent to 1,012.73, its highest close for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 9,398.19 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.5 per cent to 2,009.35.“People are desperate for the party to start again, which means that stocks are rallying even though the underlying economy is still weak,” said George Feiger, chairman of Contango Capital Advisers.“They then gather momentum as investors chase the rally.”Consumer discretionary stocks were watched closely after the sales figures and Wal-Mart’s results.The world’s biggest retailer made better profits than expected and predicted comparable sales could rise 2 per cent in the next quarter. This helped boost the shares 2.7 per cent to $51.88 in spite of disappointing quarterly revenues.Drinks group Dr Pepper Snapplealso beat earnings expectations and, after the company raised its full-year forecast, the shares climbed 6.2 per cent to $24.98.Clothing retailer Urban Outfitters also impressed with its earnings after becoming one of the few in its sector to report a quarterly rise in sales, which helped lift profit above expectations and boost its shares 3 per cent to $29.06.Ford was another stand-out performer during the day after the company said the success of the “cash-for-clunkers” programme to encourage consumers to buy new cars would mean it had to increase production over the rest of the year. The shares gained 2.6 per cent to $7.90.A late bounce saw department store Kohl’s also find gains. The company raised its full-year forecast following the quarterly results, and its shares rose 0.2 per cent to $52.39 even though that forecast remains below analyst estimates.The rest of the consumer discretionary sector did not fare so well, however, and homebuilders were particularly badly hurt both by the retail sales numbers and by analyst downgrades.The recent run-up in share prices in the sector encouraged Citigroup to recommend selling shares in DR Horton while Raymond James rated KB Home at “underperform”.DR Horton fell 3.7 per cent to $12.95 while KB Home gave up 2.5 per cent to $17.83.But strength from materials stocks bolstered the market. Metals prices were higher on the promise of improved demand from abroad and shares in miners were especially strong.Newmont Mining picked up 2.5 per cent to $41.47 while rival gold miner Freeport McMoRan gained 4.9 per cent to $66.07.Financial stocks also showed some strength with several large banks benefiting from the news that Paulson & Co, the hedge fund controlled by John Paulson, who predicted the housing crash, had taken large positions in them. Paulson became the fourth-largest shareholder in Bank of America, which rose 6.7 per cent to $17, and the second-largest at Regions Financial, which gained 7.9 per cent to $5.20.This came on a morning when trading in BofA’s shares was delayed by technical issues, the second trading problem to hit the New York Stock Exchange this week.Technology stocks were helped by positive comments from analysts. Apple’s shares climbed 1.9 per cent to $168.42 after Barclays praised its product pipeline and put a price target on the stock of $208.
289;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

If exploited properly, its mines could be a vital supplier of the world’s raw materials during this century, boosting its economy.This sentiment is affirmed by government officials and foreign mining companies.However, statements about the sector are unreliable, even as the country’s review of its mining sector draws uneasily to a close.First Quantum Minerals, a Congo-focused copper miner, is one of two large mining companies awaiting a state sign-off on its licences two years after the government undertook a review of about 60 mining licences, some signed by a previous government during a civil war.A respected company for mining investors with an appetite for “Congo risk”, First Quantum will release its interim results on Tuesday. First-half revenue is forecast at $658m (£401m).One of the questions likely to be raised with First Quantum will be about a remark made by Victor Kasongo, Congo deputy mines minister.According to Reuters, Mr Kasongo said on Friday that the licence for First Quantum’s Kolwezi project had been cancelled because the group failed to develop the copper-cobalt asset within an agreed time frame.However, Clive Newall, president of First Quantum, said on Monday: “We have not had any licences formally or informally revoked.”The company is on track to bring the project into production at the beginning of 2010, the original time frame, he said.But Mr Kasongo disagreed, saying: “First Quantum is far behind schedule. We wrote them as long ago as February 11, 2008. They knew then they were behind schedule. They cannot take being [in the Congo] for granted.”Mr Kasongo also said a year ago that the entire licence review would be completed by September 30 last year. Emile Bongeli, deputy prime minister, later announced it would be completed by February this year.As successive targets passed, an air of uncertainty damped investment interest in the sector, delaying the day when mining revenues could add to state coffers.First Quantum executives have said for months that they are on the verge of an agreement and, in spite of the lack of resolution, the company continues to invest in Kolwezi. The project has so far cost $300m.First Quantum and Freeport McMoRan, a US-based multinational mining company, have not yet received their sign-offs because they are defending the fairness of their original contracts, according to analysts.The Congo government owns 5 per cent of the Kolwezi project and a further 12.5 per cent through Gecamines, the state-owned mining company. The International Finance Corporation is also a large shareholder, adding to confusion about why the contract would be cancelled.While the intention of the review is to correct previous inequities by vesting more of the country’s mineral wealth in state hands, the danger is that fixing higher ownership stakes makes the projects un­economic for the operators, who undertake all the capital risk but pay 17.5 per cent or more of the profits to state entities. This risk is exacerbated when metals prices are low.
291;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-08-03T22:03:00Z;Wall Street stocks rally sharply;;US equities rallied sharply on Monday and the S&P 500 closed above the 1,000-point threshold for the first time since November.Improving economic data and a global rally in commodity prices and banking shares boosted sentiment and extended the market’s strong run from July into the new month.“An overshoot to 1,100 on the S&P 500 index is very plausible, with the possibility of a correction later on in the year,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi.He added that strength in second-quarter earnings and a brighter outlook for profits in the latter half of the year supports further gains in stocks – “especially if investors chase the market, as has often been the case”.The peak of the earnings season has passed and two-thirds of S&P 500 companies have reported their results, with the earnings growth rate having fallen 30.9 per cent, according to Bank of America. That is better than the forecast drop of 35.2 per cent prior to the start of earnings season.“Much of the improvement in profitability appears to be the result of expense-cutting via workforce reductions and inventory management, as opposed to top-line revenue growth,” said USAA Investment Management Company. “We believe that the recovery is likely to take longer than prior postwar recessions and exhibit lower growth than the US has enjoyed in recent decades.”The S&P 500 closed 1.5 per cent higher at 1,002.62, it’s highest level since November.The S&P has rallied almost 50 per cent from its closing low of 676.53 in early March and, for the year to date, is now up 11 per cent.Among the significant 10 sectors of the index, materials was higher by 3.5 per cent, followed by a 2.7 per cent gain in financial stocks, while energy rose 2.3 per cent as oil prices closed above $71 a barrel, their highest price since late June. Lagging sectors included telecoms providers and consumer staples.Equity volatility dipped, with the CBOE’s Vix index easing 1.3 per cent to 25.58.A rally in commodity prices boosted shares of Freeport-McMoRan with the copper miner 8 per cent higher at $65.14.Further evidence that manufacturing activity is improving, from the Institute for Supply Management, boosted US Steel, with its shares rising 8.3 per cent to $43.03.“The July ISM data is very much in keeping with a recovery picking up some momentum, even if the overall index has yet to make its way out of the contraction zone,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Securities.“The auto sector could provide a major boost to this index going forward as auto assembly has picked up and the clunkers programme will add significantly, albeit temporarily, to demand.”The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.5 per cent to 2,008.61, its first close above 2,000 since last October. Shares in Apple gained 1.9 per cent to $166.53 while Google was up 2.1 per cent at $452.21.Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google, resigned from Apple’s board amid increased competition in operating systems and software between the two technology companies.“The decision was mutual and understandable in our view, especially given that Schmidt has, for some time, been unable to fully participate in Apple’s board meetings because of this building issue,” said Scott Kessler, technology analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to 9,286.56.Strength in blue chips was led by 3M, up 2.3 per cent at $72.14, IBM, up 1.7 per cent at $119.92, Travelers, higher by 4.5 per cent at $45.02, and Caterpillar, which rallied 2.4 per cent to $45.12. Alcoa was higher by 7.2 per cent at $12.60.Banking shares also rallied, with a key banking index up 2.6 per cent in the wake of Barclays and HSBC reporting stronger-than-expected earnings.Shares in Bank Of America were 3.6 per cent higher at $15.32 while JPMorgan rose 2.5 per cent to $39.60 and Morgan Stanley gained 2.8 per cent to finish the day at $29.31.The success of the cash-for-clunkers programme of replacing old cars, had powered shares in Ford higher. The carmaker reported that car sales rose 2.3 per cent in July. It was Ford’s first monthly rise since November 2007. The stock gained 4.1 per cent to close at $8.33, and its earlier peak of $8.86, was the stock’s highest intra-day price since November 2007.
292;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Summer bargains in gold lack long-term lustre;;Traders aiming to profit from further rises in the gold price are being advised to buy before an anticipated autumn rally. But portfolio managers remain sceptical about the metal’s use as a long-term defensive asset.Last week, Julius Baer – the Swiss bank that manages a physical gold fund – revised its year-end price forecast upwards, from $875 to $925 per ounce, and said that it expected gold to hit $1,050 per ounce in 2010, rather than $900 as previously projected. Earlier in the month, the spot price had dipped below $910. Since then, however, gold has rallied strongly– breaching $950 earlier this week, before closing on Friday at $952.Research from BullionVault.com, the online gold exchange, suggests this is now part of a seasonal trend that private investors can exploit by trading physical gold.Its analysis has found that, on the 20 occasions since 1969 when the gold price dipped in the summer before rising to the year’s end, the average gain for UK investors who bought in the lowest-priced month between June and September was 13.7 per cent over six months.“As a rule, you want to buy in the summer, not September or October when the price has risen,” says Adrian Ash, BullionVault’s head of research. He describes this mid-year dip as a “summer sale”, and points out that the 18 per cent “discount” to which the gold price fell, compared with its February high, was the steepest since 1992.Summer falls in the price are not, in themselves, predictive of rallies. Over the last four decades, the gold price dipped and then rose to end the year higher only half the time: 20 out of 39 summers.Buying in a summer dip failed to pay off in 2000 and again between 2004 and 2006. “There’s no guarantee the typical rally will follow, of course,” admits Ash.But profitable “summer sales” occurred most frequently during longer-term bull phases – 13 of the 20 rallies were recorded in the 1970s and in the current decade.In fact, since the Treasury sold half the UK’s gold reserves in 1999, the sharpest gains for UK investors have come over the six months from September to February, with price rises averaging 14 per cent.This summer, with concerns about inflation gaining ground, Ash argues that “investors looking to defend their savings might want to act sooner rather than later.”This week, Moonraker Fund Management revealed that US hedge fund managers were already doing so. Of the 22 managers it interviewed, 20 said they were buying gold because of fears that quantitative easing would result in a bout of steep price rises. As a result, Moonraker’s chief investment officer Jeremy Charlesworth says he “sees more upside in gold despite the gains seen every year since 2001.”According to the World Gold Council, some investors began boosting their holdings earlier this year. By the end of June, the price had edged slightly higher to $934.50 an ounce, against $916.50 at the end of March.“Gold was sought by investors who had growing concerns about central bank’s exit strategies and the implications of a reversal in quantitative easing measures,” says the Council’s latest Investment Digest.Rather than buy physical gold, though, traders have continued to add to their holdings via listed exchange traded funds (ETFs), while retail investment in coins and small bars has slowed. This has so far compensated for weaker demand forgold from the jewellery industry.“Since mid-May, [ETF] demand has increased and total holdings for the nine largest ETFs were close to 54m ounces,” says Stephan Mueller, manager of the Julius Baer Physical Gold Fund.“We expect ETF demand to remain strong in the long term, as an increasing number of investors view gold as a strategic part of their asset allocation,” he adds.“Thanks to gold’s low to negative correlation with other asset classes, it provides attractive diversification benefits to help optimise the risk/return profile of an investor’s portfolio.”However, while the ability to trade gold ETFs and spread bets provides a short-term opportunity, discretionary portfolio managers question the metal’s long-term returns.James Edgedale, chairman of investment managers JM Finn, points out that gold has underperformed over long periods.“If you go back 25 years, gold was totally pointless until eight to 10 years ago. Investors suffered a loss of value over a 15- year period. Naturally, it is now going up as a ‘store of value’, because of hedge fund demand, private investor demand and Far Eastern demand. But it can quite easily go the other way. It isn’t the long-term store of value that people think it is – it has no industrial use, and provides no income.”Even Ash of BullionVault concedes that gold remains more of a short-term play on interest rates and inflation, than a long-term portfolio diversifier.“The long-term benefit normally espoused is its non-correlation with stocks, but it is sometimes highly correlated – from 2003 to 2008 it was very strongly correlated, and so far in July, it is correlated with the S&P 500, with an R-Squared [a measure of an assets’ price movement in line with the index] of 80 per cent.”He suggests investors need to make a short-term tactical decision on their entry point, based on returns from other asset classes.“Interest rates are very important,” he says. “Gold’s major competitor is cash, and cash is paying less than 0 per cent after inflation. One dismissive argument is that gold is supposed to be an inflation hedge and it didn’t work in the 1980s and 1990s – it was all based on performance in 1970s. But while inflation is not strong this decade, it has been stronger than interest rates.”For investors seeking higher returns over a longer period, JM Finn’s portfolio managers prefer shares in mining companies that have gold exposure and produce a dividend yield. They are watching Freeport McMoRan, the US gold and copper miner, with a view to buying on price weakness.“For a diversified portfolio, Freeport’s shares have run up recently, but when they’re down, look at it,” advises Edgedale.Alternatively, he suggests that private investors use an actively-managed fund, such as BlackRock Gold & General.“If you want to get exposure to gold and mining, BlackRock makes perfect sense – it’s a very good way of getting involved.” says Edgedale.“But buy on a low point, not a high point – it has seen a 25 per cent run in recent weeks.”
293;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-07-15T21:32:35Z;Intel triggers Wall Street rally;;US stocks rallied on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average enjoying its best day since early April, as strong earnings from chipmaker Intel encouraged investors to buy riskier assets.Stocks in material, industrial, energy and financial companies, which are sensitive to growth, all did well.But technology kicked off the rally after Intel reported better revenues and profits than expected and its shares jumped 7.3 per cent to $18.05.The microchip sector was given a further boost by better-than-expected results from Altera, which beat revenues and profit estimates and, like Intel, said profit margins would rise this year. Its shares picked up 4.2 per cent to $17.26.Other chipmakers also felt the benefit with AMD, Intel’s main rival, gaining 8.7 per cent to $3.86.Intel’s strong sales also provided optimism over personal computer sales and PC makers rose accordingly. Hewlett-Packard gained 4.5 per cent to $38.82.The rally gathered pace during the day and an upward revision in theFederal Reserve’s unemployment forecasts failed to knock it off course, as investors took confidence in a simultaneuos upgrade in the growth predictions.“The Intel numbers are enough to fuel the rally in the short term, but eventually the US unemployment rate is going to have an effect on the rest of the world,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 3 per cent up at 932.68, while the Dow rose 3.1 per cent to 8,616.21 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gained 3.5 per cent to 1,862.90.Anu Sharma, managing director of Nasdaq’s Market Intelligence Desk, described trading as a “short squeeze”, with short sellers having to buy back stocks in the worry that they might suffer heavy losses if the market rises further.There was also a warning sign on the stability of the current rally from the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility that usually drops when the market rises. It gained 3.4 per cent to 25.87 on Wednesday, suggesting investors were betting on an imminent drop.Materials stocks were also higher as the prices of metals picked up. Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper and gold, rose 5.7 per cent to $50.91. Its rival Newmont Mining gained 3.4 per cent to $40.45.Energy stocks were higher as the price of oil jumped. Chevron rose 2.5 per cent to $64.57 and Schlumberger climbed 5.3 per cent to $54.56. Investors also bought financial stocks, with banking shares continuing to bask in the afterglow of bumper profits from Goldman Sachs.But it was credit card companies that stood out after Capital One and Discover Financial both said loan losses in June had not been as bad as expected, in spite of the rising unemployment rate. Capital One jumped 11.8 per cent to $25.84 and Discover gained 6.2 per cent to $10.85.Shares in industrial companies also took part in the rally, helped by data showing industrial production had shrunk less than expected and factory output in the New York region had dropped by the smallest amount in over a year.General Electric rose 5.2 per cent to $12.24 and Caterpillar, which manufactures equipment for the industrial sector, put on 6 per cent to $33.84.The airline sector was boosted by AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, which reported a smaller-than-expected loss, which lifted the shares 4.3 per cent to $4.36.The general market optimism was tempered, however, by disappointing profits from Abbott Labs, one of the largest US drugmakers. The company also forecast full-year profits at the lower end of analysts’ expectations and the shares fell 2.6 per cent to $45.28.There were also worrying signs on consumer spending from Yum Brands, which operates the Pizza Hut and KFC fast-food franchises.It reported better earnings than expected but warned the rise in its same-store sales this year would disappoint. The stock lost 5.5 per cent to $34.05.Results from Gannett, which publishes USA Today, were more encouraging. It saw better-than-expected profit, powered by its online businesses. The shares soared 28.9 per cent to $4.50.
294;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-07-13T11:52:41Z;Jakarta sends anti-terror police to Papua mine;;Indonesia deployed scores of anti-terror police on Sunday to its eastern Papua province after two fatal shootings in as many days, and reported gun battles between security forces and unknown gunmen near the Grasberg mine owned by a subsidiary of the US’s Freeport McMoRan.Authorities said they had yet to determine whether members of the separatist Free Papua Movement (OPM) were behind the killing of an Australian Freeport technician early on Saturday and a local contract security officer the following morning.An Indonesian policeman who fled the ambush was found dead on Monday, according to police, bringing the death toll to three.Freeport’s copper and gold mine has been a source of tension in the area since it opened more than 40 years ago. In recent decades it has been a focal point for the region’s low-intensity OPM rebellion.Freeport Indonesia is the largest single taxpayer to the Indonesian government.Saturday’s shooting of Drew Grant was the first attack on a foreigner associated with Freeport since the 2002 ambush of a Freeport school bus in which two Americans were killed. After the police initially accused the military of involvement in that incident, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation helped the authorities capture and secure the conviction of a separatist commander.On Sunday senior police officers were careful not to blame anyone for the latest shootings, which they said were carried out using military and police-issue rifles.Australia’s foreign minister, Stephen Smith, said two Australian federal police officers had flown to Papua at Jakarta’s request to help with the investigation into Mr Grant’s murder.Both shootings occurred just over 50 miles north of the town of Timika on the road to Freeport Indonesia’s mining operations. Five people were injured in the incident on Sunday.Brigadier General Sulistyo Ishak, a police spokesman, said that while Saturday’s attack appeared to be that of a lone gunman, the shooting of the security guard, Markus Rattealo, could have involved more attackers. The vehicle he was travelling in was “sprayed” with bullets and five other people were injured.“After the incident, Detachment 88 [anti-terror personnel] had a gun battle with the unknown gunmen,” Gen Ishak was quoted as saying by Antara, the state news agency.Mindo Pangaribuan, a Freeport spokesman, said the violence was unexpected. “There was no indication that anything like this might occur,” he said, adding that mining operations were “continuing normally”.Indonesia’s presidential election last Wednesday, which authorities feared might have been an occasion for violence, passed relatively peacefully in Papua.Most Papuans believe Jakarta has treated them unfairly since annexing the western half of New Guinea island in 1969 after a dubious vote. The locals believe the government milks their rich resources while undertaking little development in return.Jakarta granted Papua special autonomy in 2001 but progress has been patchy. Pro-independence militants have waged a long-running insurgency against Indonesian rule in Papua, which is off-limits to foreign journalists without special permission.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent up at 8,183.17 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.3 per cent to 1,752.55.“People are looking for a reason not to sell stocks right now, rather than to buy them,” said Eric Ross, director of research at Cannacord Adams.Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets, wrote: “The overall rebound appears to be somewhat muted, suggesting this bounce may be more of a pause in selling for now rather than the start of a new upswing,”Merck exerted significant pressure on the Dow amid speculation its cholesterol medicine fared poorly in a clinical trial comparing it with a rival drug from Abbott. Its shares lost 3.7 per cent to $27.01.But there was support from financial stocks after the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time last week was shown to be much lower than expected.Banks were particularly strong gainers, supported by the economic data and by signs of progress with the government’s latest plan to clear balance sheets of toxic assets.The Treasury announced on Wednesday evening the nine fund managers with which it will work to purchase those securities under the Public-Private Investment Plan, and committed up to $30bn to it.Citigroup rose 2.7 per cent to $2.69, while Bank of Americaclimbed 1.1 per cent to $11.97.Goldman Sachs climbed after BofA recommended buying the shares, saying second-quarter earnings would be better than previous estimates as trading and investment banking delivered strong revenues. Shares in Goldman gained 3.4 per cent to $143.21.The economic optimism was tempered however by renewed talk of a second stimulus plan, as billionaire investor Warren Buffett added his voice to those calling for the government to consider such a move.But George Feiger, chairman of Contango Capital Advisers, said this should be a bullish sign for stocks. “The first stimulus hasn’t begun to work yet, so the impact will be impressive if lawmakers vote in a second,” he said.Retailers were mixed as they reported their same-store sales for June.Target, the discount retailer, reported a steeper drop than predicted but the shares jumped 3 per cent to $38.39 after the company said its second-quarter profits would meet or exceed analysts’ estimates.But there was worse news for other retailers, including Limited Brands, whose shares fell 4 per cent to $10.89 after sales at its flagship Victoria’s Secret chain fell 14 per cent.Elsewhere, investors were betting that the possible sale of American Life Insurance Company by AIGto Metlife, its rival insurer, reported in the Financial Times, could be a better deal for Metlife than its competitor. The unit is regarded as one of the jewels in AIG’s crown, and the news sent Metlife’s shares up 2.7 per cent to $27.63 while AIG tumbled 27.6 per cent to $9.48.In the technology sector, NetApprose 3.4 per cent to $19.01 after it pulled out of the bidding for Data Domain, its rival data storage company, saying it could not match an increased bid made by competitor EMCthis week.Analysts said NetApp could now become an acquisition target itself. EMC’s shares gained 1.9 per cent to $12.76 but Data Domain fell 1.4 per cent to $33.44.
296;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-07-08T23:21:57Z;Wall Street rallies in choppy trade;;"US stocks rallied late on Wednesday to end a choppy session close to where they began as investors waited cautiously for the start of the earnings season, due to open after the bell with results from Alcoa.The aluminium maker gained 1.6 per cent on an otherwise bearish Tuesday after Klaus Kleinfield, the chief executive, said he was “very optimistic” about sales. The stock swung on Wednesday as investors bet on whether the company would beat its estimates, and ended the day 0.5 per cent up at $9.46.It then jumped in the post-market session after the company reported a narrower loss than had been expected.Meanwhile, NRG defied a bearish energy sector as the price of oil continued to tumble after the company rejected a fresh takeover offer from utility company Exelon as too low.The increased bid was made last week, but NRG rebuffed the offer on Wednesday, saying it fell “far short”. NRG gained 5.8 per cent to $23.35, while Exelon closed 1 per cent up at $48.21.Financial stocks also suffered, in spite of the promise of revenues from mortgage purchases, as new mortgage applications were shown to have risen 10.9 per cent last week.Investors were more concerned with predictions from the International
Monetary Fund that the global economic contraction this year would be slightly worse than previous estimates and that the recovery was “likely to be sluggish”.Those words were echoed by G8 leaders, who are meeting in Italy this week. A G8 draft document read: “Significant risks still remain to economic and financial stability.”Citigroup and Bank of America lost 2.6 per cent to $2.62 and $11.84, respectively.“The overwhelming theme is still one of trepidation,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. “Moving into earnings season, a lot of people now think those green shoots were at best weeds. There doesn’t seem to be any
reason to buy financial stocks right now.” But the stock market was able to rebound off its lows during the afternoon after a well-subscribed auction of 10-year government debt reassured investors about the state of US finances.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent at 879.56. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 8,178.41 and the Nasq Composite index dropped 0.1 per cent to 1,747.17.“There has been a reassessment of the profit outlook as last week’s weak unemployment report suggested consumption is not going to be nearly as strong as stock prices suggested when the S&P was at 940,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.The most significant support came from the healthcare sector, where Amgen surged 13.9 per cent to $59.50 after the company said its lead experimental drug, which helps strengthen bones, performed better than a potential rival in a clinical trial.It was joined in early trade by Amylin, Alkermes and Eli Lilly, which rose after the companies said an application for a jointly developed weekly diabetes drug had been accepted by the Food and Drug Agency.But all three gave up those gains amid the wider sell-off. Amylin ended 1.4 per cent lower at $12.29, Alkermes was down 0.3 per cent at $10.23 and Eli Lilly was 0.2 per cent worse off at $33.42.There was some strength from copper miners after Citigroup upgraded Free-port McMoRan and Southern Copper. Both gained 0.2 per cent to $45.10 and $19.16, respectively.Consumer stocks were more resilient, however, with results from Family Dollar providing a boost.The budget retailer jumped 12.4 per cent to $31.18 after profits surged 36 per cent and the company said fourth-quarter profits would be in line with or above current estimates.But Pepsi Bottling Group fell in spite of beating analysts’ expectations as sales fell short of what investors had hoped. Its shares dipped 0.4 per cent to $33.53.In the technology sector, Google claimed first blood in its latest battle with Microsoft. Google plans to launch a PC operating system to rival Windows and saw its shares climb 1.5 per cent to $402.49. Those for Microsoft rose only 0.1 per cent to $22.56."
297;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-07-06T21:14:07Z;Wall St defensive stocks provide support;;Defensive stocks spurred a late rally on Wall Street to turn US equities positive on Monday following the previous session’s heavy falls.Multinational brand names fared well as investors remained in a cautious mode ahead of the start of earnings season this week.Philip Morris gained 2.8 per cent to $44.15 and Colgate-Palmolive picked up 3.2 per cent to $74.38.But energy and materials stocks were a significant drag as investors continued to worry about the pace of economic recovery.Those concerns triggered a fall on Thursday ahead of the long independence day weekend after a worse than expected jobs report, and were further heightened by words from Joe Biden, the US vice-president, over the weekend.Mr Biden said the Obama administration had “misread” how bad the economy was when forecasting 8 per cent unemployment, which took a further toll on commodities stocks as investors worried about demand.The price of oil tumbled to a five-week low, weighing on ConocoPhillips, which lost 0.3 per cent to $40.83, and Schlumberger, which fell 2.1 per cent to $51.45.Metal producers also suffered and, with Deutsche Bank warning that demand for copper could fall 3.9 per cent in 2009, shares in Freeport McMoRan, which mines the metal, gave up 7.6 per cent to $45.94.Alcoa the aluminium maker that is due to start the earnings season on Wednesday, dropped 6.1 per cent to $9.26.“We could see a defensive rotation here as investors wait cautiously for the start of earnings season,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished 0.3 per cent higher at 898.72 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 8,324.87. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.5 per cent to 1,787.40.Many big name banks were also lower with Citigroup down 3.1 per cent at $2.79 and Bank of America3.9 per cent lower at $12.15.The financial sector was near its lowest level since the results of the government’s stress tests on bank balance sheets sparked a rally in May.American Express was one of the few financial stocks to find significant gains after Stifel Nicolaus, the brokerage group, said it may benefit from new legislation restricting teaser rates, which analysts said AmEx did not rely on.AmEx’s shares picked up 5.6 per cent to $23.52.The economic negativity was punctuated by promising signs from Ford and FedEx two companies that provide early signs on consumer and corporate health.Ford’s shares lost early gains after sales at the company’s joint ventures in China rose 14 per cent to record highs. They closed 2.4 per cent lower at $5.75.Meanwhile, Michael Ducker, head of FedEx’s international business, told a German magazine that he saw signs of a turnround in the second half of the year. Shares in FedEx were up 3.2 per cent to $56.04.Data from the Institute of Supply Management also provided a glimmer of economic hope, showing that business activity in the non-manufacturing sector was marginally better than expected in June.But analysts warned economic data would need to show more positive signs to trigger another rally.“For the market to continue to rally, the news will have to go from negative to neutral or positive, and investors have started to realise that,” said Matt King, chief investment strategist at Bell Investment Advisers.EMC provided some impetus to the technology sector after the company said it would increase its offer for data storage company Data Domain to $33.50 a share.This puts EMC in a head-to-head battle with NetApp, Data Domain’s rival, which received regulatory clearance for its own bid for the company.EMC picked up 0.9 per cent to $12.89 while NetApp was 0.6 per cent lower at $18.85. Data Domain rose 2.6 per cent to $34.06.In the telecommunications sector, Sprint Nextel rose as analysts at Auriga upgraded the stock, citing continued demand for the company’s Boost pre-paid mobile telephone contracts, which have sold well during the recession.Its shares gained 3.5 per cent to $4.47.

Macy’s gave up 6.3 per cent to $11, while Best Buy dropped 5.3 per cent to $32.08 and Nordstrom, the clothing retailer, declined 7.1 per cent to $18.63.“The jobless figures were abysmal,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.“We’re now in a malevolent cycle and the risk is that the government will have to issue even more debt. This could lead to higher interest rates, which would undermine the whole V-shaped recovery.”But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, disagreed. “The market is over-reacting,” he said. “The combined loss of jobs for the last two months is only just more than that seen in January. These are the beginning stages of the stabilisation of the unemployment rate.”The S&P 500 closed 2.9 per cent down at 896.42 while the Dow Jones was 2.6 per cent per cent lower at 8,280.74. This was after trading on the New York Stock Exchange was extended for 15 minutes after a technical glitch.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.7 per cent to 1,796.52.That left the markets between 1.8 and 2.5 per cent lower for the week, which was cut short because of the Independence Day
holiday.Thursday’s selling knocked the markets out of the narrow trading range they had been in all week, which saw the close of the best quarter for the S&P since December 1998.Equities rose and fell with the price of commodities throughout the week, with oil climbing above $72 a barrel only to fall back below $68.But in a week which saw the release of several important pieces of economic data, trading volumes remained thin, with much of Wall Street taking an early break ahead of the long weekend.There was further volatility in commodities on Thursday, and energy producers fell as the price of oil continued the previous sessions’ declines.Schlumberger gave up 3.2 per cent to $52.55 and ConocoPhillips lost 2.6 per cent to $40.96.Elsewhere in the sector, NRG gave up its pre-market gains, which had been made on an increased bid from Exelon after a fall in Exelon’s share price meant there would be less of a premium attached for NRG shareholders.The bid is now $7.45bn, but NRG’s shares fell with the price of oil, dropping 4.8 per cent to $24.80. Exelon lost 4.3 per cent to $49.37.Materials companies also suffered and Freeport McMoRan the copper and gold miner, gave up 1.7 per cent to $49.72. Newmont Mining dropped 4.6 per cent to $40.26.Airlines fluctuated as Morgan Stanley reviewed its ratings on some of the biggest US carriers. The bank started coverage on Delta Air Lines, the world’s largest, recommending a price target of $9 after recent selling pressure.The shares climbed 0.5 per cent to $5.88.Morgan Stanley also upgraded shares in Continental Airlines, saying it was a likely survivor from the fall-out in the industry.There was some pressure on the stock from news on Wednesday evening that its revenue per seat may have fallen more than 20 per cent in June compared with a year earlier. But the shares still managed to gain 6.2 per cent to $9.79.Southwest Airlines fell 4.4 per cent to $6.50, however, after the bank downgraded its shares, saying higher oil prices would take a toll on profit margins.Meanwhile Illumina, which makes equipment to analyse DNA, dropped after reporting lower revenues than expected as cash-strapped researchers delayed orders. The shares lost 12.3 per cent to $33.46."

Its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $13.61.A weaker dollar boosted shares in multi-national brands. Coca-Cola, which Credit Suisse had said could soon see double-digit earnings growth, picked up 2.5 per cent to $49.18, while rival Pepsiadvanced 2.8 per cent to $56.52.Elsewhere in the sector, Yum Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut and KFC, gained 5 per cent to $35.02 after Goldman Sachs recommended buying the shares, saying its overseas businesses would probably exceed its target of 10 per cent growth in profits.Commodities stocks rallied strongly in the morning but fell back as the price of raw materials dropped during the day. Freeport McMoRan, the copper and gold miner, finished 0.9 per cent higher at $50.57.The price of oil briefly rose above $71 a barrel, but then fell back in the afternoon. After a strong morning, Chevron closed 0.4 per cent higher at $66.52 while Exxon Mobil climbed 0.9 per cent to $70.56.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 0.4 per cent higher at 923.33 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 8,504.06 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.6 per cent to 1,845.72.Investors remained focused on commodities and the dollar rather than economic data released during the morning, including two early indications on job losses.The market initially took confidence from the Challenger jobs report, which said that companies announced 9 per cent fewer job cuts in June than the previous year, the first annual decline in planned cuts since February 2008.This was counterbalanced by data from ADP Employer Services, which said companies cut more jobs than expected in June.Investors also took a near 20 per cent fall in mortgage applications during last week in their stride.“People are starting to dismiss some of the negative data and focus on the positives,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.But with the more closely watched data on initial jobless claims and the official unemployment rate due out this morning, the markets slipped as investors became more cautious.“I was surprised by the reaction to the data this morning,” said Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab. “But people have taken some of the gains off the table as we get closer to Thursday’s unemployment reports.”Pfizer gave up 0.7 per cent to $14.90 after the company said it would not continue a late stage trial of its cancer drug Sutent after disappointing results.But rival Biogen Idec climbed 3.6 per cent to $46.77 after it acquired the rights to market an experimental drug made by Acorda outside the US for a fee that could rise to $550m.An analyst at JPMorgan warned that the deal would make it less likely that Acorda would be taken over however, and its shares fell 14.9 per cent to $23.99.There was further concern for the hotel industry after Barclays said a recovery in lodging stocks would lag behind a broader recovery, and the bank downgraded shares in Choice Hotels.This came the day after Wachovia downgraded Starwood Hotels, saying similarly negative things about demand in the sector.Choice lost 2.3 per cent to $26.01. Starwood added to Tuesday’s losses, falling
4 per cent to $21.31.A second initial public offering in less than a week reinforced optimism about demand for new equity, as shares in LogMeIn, a newly listed software maker, rose 25.1 per cent to $20.02 on its first day of trade."

But the markets remained subdued after disappointing news from Boeing suppressed early gains, which came on higher commodities prices and economic optimism.The aircraft manufacturer announced a further delay to its 787 Dreamliner, which is already two years behind schedule, as the company looks to reinforce part of the bodywork. The news sent the shares tumbling 6.5 per cent to $43.87.There was a knock-on effect on other parts of the market, particularly on
Boeing’s suppliers.Honeywell lost 0.5 per cent to $31.43, Rockwell Collins slid 1.2 per cent to $41.91 and Goodrich fell 0.7 per cent to $49.07.Banking stocks also lost ground after initial rises as fresh economic data did not prove as positive as some had hoped.Sales of existing homes rose less than expected in May but most banks managed to hold on to some of their early gains as house prices remained relatively stable and manufacturing rose in the Richmond,
Virginia, area.Bank of America closed up 2.4 per cent at $12.23 and JPMorgan finished 2.1 per cent higher at $33.57.Commodities stocks also made a partial recovery as materials prices rose following a bruising previous session. The price of oil picked up, and was followed by energy companies. Schlumberger rose 1.9 per cent to $53.30 while ConocoPhillips climbed 2 per cent to $41.25.Metal producers were also higher following Monday’s losses. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, climbed 4.4 per cent to $47.18 while AK Steel gained 7.2 per cent to $17.68.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.2 per cent at 895.10 but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 8,322.91 and the Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.1 per cent to 1,764.92.“I don’t think this is the start of a major pull-back,” said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services.“Buyers and sellers have come together and begun to agree on a fair price following the powerful rally, which is why we have seen sideways trade.”But Tim Howkins, chief executive of IG Group, said: “Equities need to go down again. They bounced too quickly and the feeling is we still need to see a
complete capitulation.”The mood on Wall Street was lifted by encouraging words from Moody’s, the rating agency, which said the triple A rating on US debt “remains solid”, easing fears about how costly it could become for the government to borrow and fund its stimulus plans.The optimism surrounding the government’s spending power was later boosted by the afternoon’s auction of Treasury debt.Kroger, the supermarket operator, reported better than expected profits before the market opened but the results failed to provide a fillip for the stock as revenues came in lower than analysts had predicted. The shares slipped 0.1 per cent to $21.76.There was better news for fellow retailer Office Depot, as it received a $350m cash infusion from BC Partners in return for a 20 per cent stake. The stock advanced 2.6 per cent to $3.89.Several pieces of news from the mobile-phone sector buoyed communications and technology companies.Intel rose after Bloom-berg reported that the company had won a contract to supply microchips to Nokia for use in its mobile-phone handsets.The deal would be a breakthrough in Intel’s efforts to secure a foothold in the mobile telephone market, and the shares gained 0.8 per cent to $15.81.Meanwhile, Motorola picked up 4 per cent to $6.27 after Bank of America recommended buying the shares, saying that Motorola was having some success with new handset sales to carriers.Metro PCS, the mobile service operator, climbed on news that it would replace Tyco Electronics in the S&P 500 from June 29. This would mean the company’s shares may be bought by investors trying to track the benchmark index. The stock advanced 5.2 per cent to $14.33. Tyco fell 2.6 per cent to $18.59."

Fears over global demand knocked oil prices, which continued to fall from their highs.Shares in energy companies followed oil lower, with ConocoPhillipsfalling 5.9 per cent to $40.43 and Schlumberger giving up 5.5 per cent to $52.32.Copper prices also suffered after estimated Chinese copper consumption dropped 3.5 per cent for May compared to April, leading to concerns that the country might soon stop restocking the metal.Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper, lost 11.3 per cent to $45.18. Prices of other metals also fell, bringing down shares in the companies that produce them. AK Steel gave up 13 per cent to $16.50 while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, fell
8.9 per cent to $10.02.The general economic worries were exacerbated by a report from the World Bank that warned the global recession would be deeper than it had predicted in March, with the world economy suffering a 2.9 per cent decline in 2009.“The figure is surprisingly downbeat given the fact that it is even lower than what the International Monetary Fund is expecting,” said Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics.Karl Mills, president of Jurika, Mills & Keifer, agreed, saying: “The economy is still sicker than people realise.”The S&P closed down 3.1 per cent at 893.04, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4 per cent to 8,339.01 points and the Nasdaq Composite index declined 3.4 per cent to 1,766.19 points.Investors bet that volatility would return to the markets after several weeks of trading within a narrow range.The Vix index, a measure of implied volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge spiked 11.4 per cent to 31.19.US investors were also nervous about the pace of the domestic recovery after Walgreen, the fast growing chain of chemists and general retailers, reported lower profits than Wall Street expected, despite rising sales. The shares fell 5.7 per cent to $29.64.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said that recent signs on corporate earnings were not promising. “The profit outlook is becoming less certain given the recent trend in earnings reports and a more mixed economic outlook,” he wrote.Delta Air Lines dropped 6.9 per cent to $5.65 after Richard Anderson, the chief executive, said the company has absorbed a $250m hit to second-quarter revenue as a result of swine flu, and had been forced to cut capacity as a result.Shares in Apple fluctuated as optimism over sales of the new model of its iPhone competed with concerns over the health of Steve Jobs, its talismanic chief executive.The stock slipped in pre-market trade after reports at the weekend that Mr Jobs had undergone a liver transplant two months ago.But the shares rose after the company said it had sold more than 1m units of the new iPhone, compared to forecasts of closer to 500,000.The stock opened higher, but then dropped as the market extended its losses. It closed 1.5 per cent lower at $137.37.Bank of America lost 9.7 per cent to $11.94 after two more board members joined the list of departures from the company, bringing the total to seven since April.Its rival Citigroup dropped 5.4 per cent to $3, with analysts at Fox-Pitt saying that the bank’s planned conversion of preferred shares into common equity would put “significant pressure” on the stock.Credit card company Discover Financial Services avoided the worst of the selling in the financial sector following its announcement of a surprise quarterly profit last week.The figures caused analysts at RBC Capital Markets to raise their price target on the company on Monday, and the shares fell a modest 0.1 per cent to $9.31."

This was part of the reason for the decision by S&P to downgrade 22 banks.The rating agency said: “We believe the banking industry is undergoing a structural transformation that may include radical changes with permanent repercussions.”This sent bank shares sharply lower. And although the market took some reassurance from the president’s speech, banking shares remained lower.Wells Fargo, which was cut by one notch to AA-, lost 5.4 per cent to $23.09, while Fifth Third, which S&P cut by two notches to BBB, dropped 5.2 per cent to $6.81.“The effect of the regulation is a little bit worrying,” said Stephen Auth of Federated Investors. “But even though it could reduce returns, it may be helpful in damping risk also.”The effect of those falls was outweighed by a strong performance from drug makers. Pfizer gained 3 per cent to $14.58, while Merck rose 1.4 per cent
to $24.77.The sector had been sparked into life by news that Watson Pharmaceuticals was to buy the privately owned Arrow, which makes generic drugs. The deal will cost Watson $1.75bn in cash and shares, and its stock gained 5 per cent to $30.27.Although shares rallied in the afternoon as investors took confidence from positive words about the outlook for the US AAA credit rating from S&P, they fell back again shortly before the close.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 0.1 per cent down at 910.71 and 8,497.18 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.7 per cent to 1,808.06 however.Equities had spent the early part of the morning in negative territory after results from FedEx gave rise to concerns about the health of corporate spending.The second-largest US package delivery company, whose results often indicate the health of the wider business community, beat analysts’ forecasts with its quarterly earnings.But FedEx’s shares fell 1.4 per cent to $50.70 as it said first-quarter earnings could be less than half analysts’ estimates.Consumer stocks rallied strongly during the afternoon, however, with Abercrombie & Fitch a stand-out performer after the clothing retailer said it would close its struggling Ruehl chain. The shares rose 4.5 per cent to $26.97.The strength in the sector came as figures showed inflation is not a near-term concern, with consumer prices rising less than analysts forecast.This followed Monday’s producer price numbers, which revealed a much more moderate rise than some had feared.Wall Street also took solace from results from Adobe, the software company, whose revenues and profits dropped sharply compared with a year ago but remained ahead of analysts’ estimates. The shares gained 1.8 per cent to $28.68.Lincoln National avoided the worst of the sell-off in the financial sector after it said it had completed a $600m capital raising, having sold 40m shares at $15 each. The stock closed 1.1 down at $14.90.E-Trade, the struggling online broker, dropped 11.5 per cent to $1.46 after the company said it would look to raise $1.2bn in fresh capital to boost its balance sheet by selling new equity and launching a debt exchange.Commodity stocks continued their falls of the previous few sessions as metal prices fell further from last week’s peaks. Alcoa, which produces aluminium, lost 3.8 per cent to $10.49, while Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gave up 3.7 per cent to $50.48.Steelmakers also continued their recent falls as metal prices dropped.

But its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $50.35 as the company said first-quarter earnings could be less than half of analysts’ estimates.Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for JPMorgan Private Bank said that results from Best Buy and FedEx demonstrate that earnings are not the problem. ”Revenues are falling and companies still need to cuts costs, which push other company’s revenues lower. There is no consumer spending power in this economy and equities face a considerable period of consolidation.”This knocked futures and the markets opened in negative territory. After half an hour of trade the benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index were both down 0.3 per cent at 909.21 and 1,791.94 respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a fraction to 8,501.72.Wall Street was took some solace in results from Adobe, the software company, whose revenues and profits both dropped sharply compared to a year ago, but remained ahead of analysts’ estimates. The shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.80.Concerns over business spending were exacerbated by worries over the consumer sector after consumer confidence was shown to have dipped last week. There were further negative signs on individuals’ financial health from figures showing mortgage applications fell 15.8 per cent last week compared with the previous week as mortgage rates rose.There were encouraging signs, however, that inflation is still not a near-term concern after the consumer price index was shown to have risen by 0.1 per cent in May compared with April, which was less than analysts’ predictions. This followed Monday’s producer price numbers, which showed a much more moderate rise than some had thought.All this came on a day when the government was set to unveil an overhaul of financial regulation, which would give the Federal Reserve much more power to monitor financial companies that pose systemic risk.The increased regulation was one of the factors in the decision by S&P to cut its credit rating on 22 banks, saying, “We believe the banking industry is undergoing a structural transformation that may include radical changes with permanent repercussions.” This sent banking shares tumbling. Wells Fargo, which was cut by one notch to AA-, lost 3.9 per cent to $23.45, while Fifth Third, which S&P cut by two notches to BBB, dropped 8.4 per cent to $6.58.Lincoln National was one of the few financial companies to find gains after it said it had completed a $600m capital raising, having sold 40m shares at $15 each. The stock was up 0.3 per cent at $15.10 by mid-morning.E*Trade, the struggling online broker, dropped 13.9 per cent to $1.42, however, after the company said it would look to raise $1.2bn in new capital to boost its balance sheet by selling new equity and launching a debt exchange.Commodity stocks continued their falls of the previous few sessions as the price of materials fell further from last week’s peaks. Alcoa, which produces aluminium, lost 4.2 per cent to $10.44 while Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gave up 4.1 per cent to $50.25.Steelmakers also continued their recent falls as metal prices dropped, and Nucor lost 3 per cent to $45.45. Even Steel Dynamics fell in spite of received temporary waivers for two financial requirements on $1.5bn of bank loans in exchange for higher interest rates. The shares gave up 3.7 per cent to $14.70.There was further consolidation in the healthcare sector as Watson Pharmaceuticals said it would buy the privately owned Arrow Group, which makes generic drugs. The deal will cost Watson $1.75bn in cash and shares, and its stock gained 5.2 per cent to $30.33.European stocks were lower early on Wall Street.

The shares lost 7.3 per cent to $35.84.There was some positive news on the sector from Tyco Electronics, which makes electronic connectors. The company said sales had improved in consumer-related markets and profits may be almost three times higher than forecast. Its shares advanced 3.7 per cent to $19.98.But this could not prevent Best Buy’s weak sales from encouraging investors to sell shares in other retailers. Targetfell 3.7 per cent to $38.62 while Home Depot lost 2.7 per cent to $23.20.Stocks had been supported during the morning by rising commodity prices, but these fell again during the afternoon, extending the trend of the previous two sessions, dragging metal producers with them.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, dropped 5 per cent to $52.39 and Alcoa, which produces aluminium, declined 2.8 per cent to $10.90.Steelmakers, which have moved from stellar gains to sharp losses in the past few sessions, intially picked up ground after Nucor said orders had improved over recent weeks, helping it to project a narrower quarterly loss than expected.But Nucor was the only one to hold onto gains amid the sell-off and the shares closed 2.4 per cent up at $46.86.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 1.3 per cent down at 911.97, and 8,504.67 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 1.1 per cent to 1,796.18.“The market is rtrying to figure out right now whether this is some sort of correction that is building or if it is just a break in an extended recovery,” said Larry Coates, chief executive of Oak Value Capital Management.The rising price of commodities, and especially oil, was shown to have pushed inflation up in May as the Producer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent from April.But this was much more moderate than analysts had predicted, easing fears that inflation could hamper stocks later in the year.There was also a boost from figures showing that builders started work on many more homes in May than expected.But some analysts warned the headline figures on housing starts hid worrying trends.“Inventories remain high, and builders seem to be building to compete with cheap foreclosed houses, which will keep the pressure on prices,” said Brett Hryb, portfolio manager with MFC Global Investment Management.The positive effect of the economic data was further tempered by figures showing industrial production in May fell more than analysts had predicted.Healthcare was one of the few sectors to enjoy a positive day as investors bet President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms would have to be scaled back after the Congressional Budget Office said the current plan would leave 30m Americans uninsured.Health insurers have suffered on the White House plans, which include scaling back subsidies for those companies. But as the proposals came under attack, major insurers gained.Aetna rose 4.7 per cent to $23.58 and Coventry Health climbed 3.5 per cent to $16.71.The sector was further boosted by Amgen, the biotechnology company, whose shares climbed 3.6 per cent to $51.21 after they were upgraded by Sanford Bernstein. The broker said revenues and earnings should re-accelerate over the year.Citigroup dropped 3.6 per cent to $3.25 after Vikram Pandit, the chief executive, said companies would have to look elsewhere than American consumption for growth drivers as the US adjusts to slower growth and less credit.AT&T dropped 1.7 per cent to $24.22 meanwhile after its shares were downgraded by Barclays Capital, which said continuing high unemployment would make growth difficult.

Its movement was matched by that of leading energy producers.Schlumberger rose 8.6 per cent in the first four sessions of the week, but fell 3.1 per cent on Friday to $60.27. ConocoPhillips lost 2.6 per cent to $44.37.Metal producers also lost some of the week’s gains as the boom in prices for their products slowed. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, lost 3.2 per cent to $58.51. AK Steel, the steel maker that has surged over 13 per cent this week, fell 5.7 per cent to $19.93.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.1 per cent at 946.21, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 8,799.26, pushing the blue chip benchmark into positive territory for the year.The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 0.2 per cent to 1,858.80 points.“We’ve had a really good run up on commodities and there is a certain amount of covering positions ahead of the weekend,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.“Some managers will also be looking to lock in profits before the end of the quarter.”That left the S&P 0.7 per cent ahead of where it closed last week, while the Dow rose 0.4 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 0.5 per cent.The market spent the week focused on interest rates and the threat of inflation as climbing commodity prices were further fuelled by a falling dollar and climbing bond yields.Last week’s better-than-expected fall in non-farm payrolls triggered worries that an improving economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.“Inflation is a serious threat, perhaps not in three to six months, but in 12 to 18 months, and we have been investing in inflation protection assets,” said Charles Zhang, managing partner of Zhang Financial.BlackRock finally confirmed its $13.5bn purchase of Barclays Global Investors on Thursday to create the world’s largest money manager.The impending deal had been widely reported during the week, sending BlackRock’s shares up 5 per cent.The final price was a shade over the $13bn that had been reported, however, which sent BlackRock’s shares down 3.3 per cent at $176.56.The company was also hit by a downgrade in its credit rating from S&P following the deal, which will give it an extra $3bn of debt.Elsewhere in the sector, Hartford Financial, the insurer and financial services company, said it would take $3.4bn in government bail-out money and sell $750m of stock amid what it called a “continued uncertain economic environment”. This sent the company’s shares down 8 per cent to $12.95.In the technology sector, National Semiconductor shares fell after it reported a loss.The microchip maker had better sales than expected, but had to pay $100m in restructuring costs, leading to a worse loss than had been predicted.Its shares dropped 6.1 per cent to $13.59.Other microchip companies suffered. Texas Instruments lost 0.2 per cent to $20.79 while market leader Intel gave up 0.2 per cent to $16.31.
306;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-06-10T15:19:08Z;Oil rise boosts US energy stocks;;US stocks rose on Wednesday morning as Wall Street remained focused on inflation indicators, with commodity prices continuing to rise and the dollar slipping further.The price of oil briefly topped $71 for the first time since October last year, but then fell back. By mid-morning US crude was up $0.97 at $70.98.This boosted energy stocks, including Chevron, which gained 1.8 per cent to $71.43 and ConocoPhillips, which picked up 1.9 per cent to $46.40.Other commodities also continued the week’s gains, with rising metals prices driving shares in Alcoa, the aluminium producer, which rose 3.1 per cent to $11.50 and Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, which advanced 2.6 per cent to $60.47.Materials ane energy stocks drove the benchmark S&P 500 index higher, and after half an hour of trade, it was 0.4 per cent up at 946.44. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 8,812.26 but the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.2 per cent to 1,856.38.Home Depot boosted the consumer sector after it said profits may be flat this year, having previously forecast a 7 per cent decline. The company reaffirmed its sales targets, but said profit margins could be slightly higher. Its shares lifted 1.9 per cent to $24.80.The news also helped rival home improvement retailer Lowe’s find gains, picking up 0.9 per cent to $20.65.Brown-Forman added to the optimism on consumer spending after it reported better results than expected. The company, which owns the Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort drink brands, saw sales fall less than analysts had predicted and its shares climbed 2.8 per cent to $46.55.Banking stocks were sluggish on the growing signs of inflation and economic data showing mortgage applications fell over 7 per cent last week.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which both said on Tuesday that they had been granted permission to repay money from the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program, saw their price targets lifted at JPMorgan, which cited the strength of the companies’ fixed income units.But shares in both companies fell after Lloyd Bankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, said the current upturn in global markets did not signal the end of the recession, saying it would be long and protracted. Shares in Goldman lost 0.9 per cent to $147.91 while Morgan Stanley fell 2.4 per cent to $30.25.Citigroup finally got its long awaited $58bn stock swap under way, the day after the board met Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Desposit Insurance Corporation, in an effort to diffuse growing tensions between the two parties. Even though Ms Bair did not address the position of Vikram Pandit, the chief executive whom the regulator is pushing to replace, people close to the matter said the meeting had a conciliatory tone. The shares rose 4.7 per cent to $3.57.Meanwhile Ameriprise became the latest in a long line of financial companies to announce it would issue shares in order to raise further capital. The financial services company said it might use the money to make acquisitions, although it didn’t name specific targets. Its shares fell 9.2 per cent to $25.79.Elsewhere, shares in real estate broker CB Richard Ellis spiked 15.5 per cent to $9.40 after the company said it will raise $400m by selling bonds and a further $100m by selling shares to Paulson & Co, the hedge fund. The company also said it may sell up to $50m more in equity and use the money to pay off debt.European stocks were higher early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was up 1.7 per cent at 884.31. Asian equity markets closed mainly up, led by the Nikkei 225 average, which closed 2.1 per cent higher at 9,991.49Bond yields were generally up, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rising 2 basis point to 3.876 per cent although that on the two-year note fell 1bp to 1.294 per cent.The dollar was weaker against major currencies early in New York, losing 0.7 per cent against the pound to $1.64.Gold was trading $0.01 higher at $954.79 per troy ounce.
307;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-06-09T20:51:29Z;US investors turn to materials and energy stocks;;"US equities edged upwards but stayed within the narrow range of the past six sessions as rising commodities and a slipping dollar failed to spark significant buying.Metal producers fared well as prices for their products rose. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gained 4.4 per cent to $58.96 while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, advanced 3.5 per cent to $11.15.Steel makers were also helped by rising metals prices, as well as analysis by Morgan Stanley, which upgraded shares in US Steel and AK Steel but downgraded those of larger rival Nucor.Shares in US Steel rose 7.9 per cent to $37.82 and AK Steel jumped 9.8 per cent to $19.10. Nucor’s gains were limited to 2.1 per cent at $47.76.But the strength in materials stocks was countered by weakness from the consumer sector, where Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer company, warned that the short-term environment remained challenging. P&G’s shares dropped 1.4 per cent to $52.41.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent up at 942.43, close to its highest finish of the year, and the Nasdaq Composite index finished 1 per cent higher at 1,860.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a fraction lower at 8,763.06.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford, said investors were looking at the dollar and commodities prices for signs of inflation to interpret the future direction of interest rates.“The market can only focus on one thing at once, and all week that has been whether interest rates will rise,” she said.Texas Instruments provided a boost for the technology sector after the microchip manufacturer said demand for its products would drive second-quarter sales and profits higher than previously forecast. The shares gained 6.3 per cent to $21.02.Bank of America added to the optimism in the sector when it said Microchip Technology‘s orders from China had improved, causing the bank to raise its price target on the company to $23. Microchip Technology’s shares picked up
6 per cent to $23.07.Other microchip manufacturers also benefited. Texas’s larger rival Intel advanced 3.1 per cent to $16.42 while Applied Materials gained 1.6 per cent to $11.03.News that the government will allow 10 of the country’s largest banks to repay a total of $68bn from the troubled asset relief programme failed to give the sector a lift, even though banks that repay the money will free themselves of some government involvement in matters such as hiring and executive pay.Several banks confirmed that they were on the list and some said they planned to repay the money soon. Morgan Stanley said it would repay its $10bn infusion in full but its shares fell 1.3 per cent to $30.98.Capital One, the credit card company, said it expected to repay its Tarp money “within weeks” and its shares rose 2.6 per cent to $24.05. American Express said it had also received approval, and its stock gained 5 per cent to $26.93.US Bancorp lost 0.9 per cent to $18.18 after it said it would also repay Tarp money but that the process of doing so would cost the bank $153m in second-quarter earnings.Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, said: “Financial stocks have been held back by the threat of inflation. We are seeing the negative effects of too much good economic news.”Some of the positive effect on financial stocks from the Tarp news was also damped by the congressional panel overseeing the Tarp process, which said the stress tests should be repeated on tougher terms.BlackRock continued its gains of the previous session as the company closed in on the purchase of Barclays Global Investors for a sum of $12bn-$13bn to create the world’s biggest money manager.The purchase would mean BlackRock has beaten off late competition for the unit from Bank of New York Mellon, and the company’s shares lifted 7.6 per cent to $182.14.BoNYM’s shares climbed 0.9 per cent to $28.79, as it confirmed it was also on the list of those allowed to repay Tarp funds."
308;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-06-08T20:44:29Z;Wall Street recovers losses in late trade;;US stocks staged a late recovery on Monday to end roughly where they were at the end of the previous session after a day spent almost entirely in negative territory.The equities markets opened lower on worries that interest rates might rise later in the year and stall an economic recovery.“Bond yields have been on the rise and that spells weaker than average performance,” wrote analysts at Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch. “We found that stocks deliver below-average performance when interest rates rise dramatically.”Don Galante, senior vice-president of fixed income at MF Global, agreed, saying: “The risk is that such a rise could shut the economic recovery down.”But financial stocks, which were the only sector to perform well throughout the day, led a late reversal while the market waited to see which banks would be first to be allowed to repay money from the government’s troubled asset relief program.The Wall Street Journal reported JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs would be named on the initial list. But while JPMorgan gained 2.4 per cent to $35.39, Goldman gave up 0.4 per cent to $148.35. Citigroup rose ahead of an expected swap of preferred shares into common stock.The Financial Times reported over the weekend that the bank’s plan to raise $33bn in capital had been postponed after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation threatened to lower a crucial financial health rating as part of the regulator’s drive to replace Vikram Pandit, chief executive. Citigroup shares closed 1.2 per cent higher at $3.42.The paper also reported that Bank of New York Mellon and BlackRock were competing to buy Barclays Global Investors.BlackRock, which Reuters reported was the frontrunner with an offer of about $12bn, gained 3.4 per cent to $169.36, while BNY Mellon picked up 1.1 per cent to $28.54.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent down at 939.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, on which Travelers and Cisco made their first appearance, replacing Citigroup and General Motors, edged a fraction up to 8,764.49. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 1,842.40.Materials were the biggest drags on equities markets as the price of oil and metals dropped.Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper, lost 1.2 per cent to $56.48, while Nucor, the steelmaker, dropped 1.6 per cent to $46.76.Multinationals felt the effect of the strengthening dollar. McDonald’s was a particularly heavy faller as the company warned that exchange rates could cost the company 20 cents per share for the year.The warning negated the impact of a stronger-than-expected rise in global sales for May and the company’s shares fell 1.9 per cent to $58.72.General Mills, which makes food brands such as Cheerios, gained 4 per cent to $54.22 after the company said 2009 earnings would be several cents better than forecast.Apple shares lost 0.6 per cent to $143.85 even though the company unveiled a new iPhone and a new Mac operating system at its annual developers conference.There had been early rumours that Steve Jobs, chief executive, might make an unexpectedly early return from ill health at the conference.However, the company said his return was not expected until the end of June.Meanwhile Palm, Apple’s latest competitor in the smartphone market, retreated 6.5 per cent to $12.16 in spite of reports that the company’s Pre phone had sold out at some stores during its launch over the weekend.Investors were concerned the new iPhone would reassert Apple’s position in the market.Verisign, which operates internet domain names, fell more than any other on the S&P after a court on Friday allowed an antitrust suit against the company which claims its pricing of the .com and .net domain names is artificially high.The company’s shares slumped 14.2 per cent to $19.90.
309;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-05-20T20:30:06Z;Fed forecast sours Wall Street mood;;"US stocks suffered a late sell-off on Wednesday as a downward revision to growth figures and the progress of a bill to overhaul credit card lending helped tip the markets into negative territory.Banks led the selling after the Fed’s open market committee released the minutes from its last meeting, in which it lowered its predictions for GDP and raised those for unemployement.They saw another dip on reports that President Barack Obama was ready to sign the credit card bill, which would limit fees and impose new restrictions on when lenders can raise interest rates for risky customers.American Express lost 3.3 per cent to $23.98, while JPMorgan, which also has a sizeable credit card lending arm, gave up 3.5 per cent to $34.55.Oher banks also fell back after participating in the early rally.Regions Financial said it wanted to raise $1.25bn by offering new stock in order to make up its shortfall following the government’s stress tests on banks.Investors worried about stock dilution and its shares fell 6.7 per cent to $4.89.PNC, meanwhile, fell 2.8 per cent to $42.06 after saying it would not rush to repay government bail-out money but do so “over the next couple of years”.This contrasted with statements from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in recent days that they would pay back the government as soon as possible.The falls reversed earlier earlier gains after the market took confidence from higher commodities prices and Bank of America’s success in raising capital.Bank of America’s shares rose after the company said it had sold a total of 1.25bn shares at an average price of $10.77 since last
Friday. The stock closed up 2.1 per cent at $11.49.“Bank of America’s rise is a kneejerk reaction and we are not seeing that replicated across the banking sector,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 0.5 per cent to 903.47, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average list 0.6 per cent to 8,422.04. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 1,727.84.Broader support came from energy stocks after the price of oil rose back over $60 a barrel following Department of Energy figures showing US oil inventories fell last week.Schlumberger gained 1.9 per cent to $55.04, while rival ConocoPhillips picked up
0.6 per cent to $46.19.A rise in general commodity prices and the falling dollar also boosted materials companies. Newmont Mining, which produces gold, gained 4.5 per cent to $45.55, while Freeport McMoRan, which mines gold and copper, rose 1 per cent to $50.Hewlett-Packard proved a drag on the Dow as it gave back the gains made during Tuesday’s trade after reporting earnings in line with analysts’ estimates.Its shares fell 5.2 per cent to $34.67 after the company said sales in the third quarter would be below current consensus predictions.Its rival, Dell, also suffered from the negative outlook for the computer sales industry and its shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $11.18.But chip manufacturers lent strength to the technology sector after Analog Devices’ profits beat Wall Street’s estimates and the company said it would earn more for the full year than currently predicted.The company said there had been strength in sales to telecommunications infrastructure customers and
its shares jumped 15.7 per cent to $23.80.Rivals National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices also found gains on the positive comments from Analog, rising 6.6 per cent to $13.23 and 2.5 per cent to $4.50, respectively.Investors also watched for signs on consumer activity as budget retailers Target and BJâ€™s both beat analysts’ expectations with their quarterly profits. Target’s shares gained 2.4 per cent to $42.94 after it beat expectations on the back of tight cost controls and a profitable credit card business.BJ’s also beat predictions as consumers looked to buy staples at wholesale prices. But its shares slipped 4.4 per cent to $36.37 after the company said it expected second-quarter sales to decline.On a quiet day with low volumes, however, most investors were not overly worried by the losses.“It looks like there has been a continual but moderate consolidation of the big gains on Monday,” said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at Wells Fargo advisers."
310;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-05-08T18:56:51Z;Financials lead Wall St higher;;"Wall Street responded positively as banks rushed to the market to offer new equity on Friday following the results of the government’s stress tests.Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley were the first two banks to act, raising $7.5bn each – Wells purely through equity and Morgan Stanley through equity and debt.Wells sold its shares at $22, but its stock traded higher than that. By mid-
afternoon its shares were up 6.1 per cent at $26.26. Morgan Stanley fell 0.4 per cent to $27.24.Other banks saw sharp rises after the results of the tests showed that they had to raise less money to survive the government’s most adverse scenario than many had feared.Citigroup rose 7.1 per cent to $4.08 after it said it would raise the additional $5.5bn of capital it needed by expanding its scheme to convert preference shares into common stock.Bank of America also moved higher, building on gains of more than 55 per cent for the week after its capital needs were found to be $33.9bn, as previously reported.The bank said it would raise the money without converting any of its government-held preferred shares into common stock, so avoiding a majority-government holding. That helped its shares pick up 3.9 per cent to $14.03, which Ken Lewis, chief executive, admitted was “counter-intuitive”, given the risk of dilution from a $17bn equity raising.Regional banks also performed well, even though several were found to need to bolster their balance sheets. Fifth Third was the biggest gainer, soaring 57.3 per cent to $8.41.“Investors were more concerned about government involvement than dilution,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com. “They thought the government was going to be the only one contributing
capital, which would be a losing game.”This followed a week of leaks and rumours surrounding the results of the tests, during which the market had continued to rally.By Friday afternoon, the benchmark S&P 500 was 1.6 per cent higher at 922.16 points, putting it on course for a weekly gain of 5.1 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.3 per cent to 8,517.30, towards a rise of 3.8 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite index headed towards a much smaller weekly gain as investors began to take profits following its recent outperformance. The Nasdaq rose 0.5 per cent on Friday to 1,725.52 points, 0.4 per cent up for the week.Meanwhile the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell over 10 per cent during the week as investors bet on more stable market conditions in the short to medium term.Futures dipped before the market opened on Friday morning after the release of the unemployment figures for April. Although fewer non-farm employees lost their jobs in April than analysts had estimated, many investors believed the consensus estimates were overly bearish.They focused instead on an upward revision in March’s figures as well as the fact that employment was boosted by new, but short-term, government jobs.Stocks were able to hold on to gains during Friday though, helped by materials stocks that were boosted by rising commodity prices.Alcoa, the aluminium maker, gained 1.9 per cent to $10.04, while Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper, rose 5.3 per cent to $51.65.Shares in energy producers also performed well as the price of oil continued its recent rally. Schlumberger rose 3.9 per cent to $56.22 while ConocoPhillips gained 6.1 per cent to $46.42.Elsewhere, CBS, the broadcaster, reported a surprise loss as revenues from advertising slumped. The shares rose 2 per cent to $8.22 however after Fred Reynolds, chief financial officer, said the company could meet its obligations until 2012 without issuing more debt."
311;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-05-04T20:52:26Z;S&P tops 900 as investors return to banks;;US stocks surged on Monday, taking the benchmark S&P 500 above 900 points and into positive territory for the year, in a day dominated by rumour surrounding the government’s stress tests on banks.Citigroup and Bank of America are both believed to working on plans to raise $10bn of capital, while they, and at least two other lenders, are still contesting the government’s findings on the strength of their balance sheets. Bank of America denied that it was working on a $10bn plan.But banking stocks extended early rallies after Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the Obama administration, said banks would be expected to raise money needed to pass the tests privately rather than go to the government.With many analysts saying further government involvement would come with heavier regulation, investors took confidence from the news.Citigroup’s shares rose 7.7 per cent to $3.20, while Bank of America jumped 19.3 per cent to $10.38 and JPMorgan climbed 10.2 per cent to $35.79.Wells Fargo leapt 23.7 per cent to $24.25 after Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, called it a “fabulous” bank, even though Associated Press reported the government wanted it to boost its capital reserves.Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams, said that if banks needed to raise capital to pass the government’s tests, it would be bad news for existing shareholders no matter how it is done.“People are living in a dream world right now,” he said. “Shareholders are going to be so diluted. There is no way I would buy American banks at this level.”The gains were extended by figures showing that sales of existing homes had risen unexpectedly in March, providing signs that the housing market could be nearing a bottom.The S&P rose 3.4 per cent to 907.24, the first time it has closed above 900 since early January, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.6 per cent to 8,426.74 points. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.6 per cent to 1,763.56 points.China’s manufacturing expanded in April for the first time in nine months, helping push up metals prices and shares in US metal producers.Freeport McMoRan, the copper and gold producer, rose 9.4 per cent to $48.64, while Alcoa gained 6.9 per cent to $10.36.This added to optimism from Sprint Nextel the mobile network operator. The group reported a surprise profit on Monday as cost-cutting efforts added to stronger-than-expected revenues, driven by customers joining its cheaper plans. The company’s shares rose 7.1 per cent to $5.General Motors advanced in the morning after Sergio Marchionne, Fiat chief executive, said he wanted to purchase GM’s European operations by the end of May to create a European supergroup. But its shares later drifted and closed flat for the session at $1.81.There was good news for retailers, as Barclays raised its price target on both JC Penneyand Target on which it also raised its earnings outlook for 2009 and 2010. JC Penney, which Barclays said should recover its margins on the back of lean inventories, gained 5.1 per cent to $32.59.Even though Target was downgraded by Bank of America, which said the group might struggle to keep sale numbers and prices at current levels, it managed to rise 1.3 per cent to $40.55.Pepsi Bottling Group rejected a bid of $29.50 a share from Pepsico to buy up the remaining shares in the group, calling it “grossly inadequate”.Pepsi fell 1.4 per cent to $49.10 on the news, but Pepsi Bottling Group per cent gained 0.3 per cent to $31.50.There was a mixed picture for technology. Adobe, the software maker, was downgraded by Citi and UBS, which both said the stock was unlikely to move higher after the recent rally. It fell 2.8 per cent to $26.69.Intel, the chipmaker, rose after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to “overweight” from “equal weight”, saying orders would improve. It rose 5.4 per cent to $16.66.“The rally is being overdone,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at thinkorswim.“If we continue higher, we will have to sell off before Thursday or the results of the stress test could work against us.”
312;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-04-27T20:34:27Z;Wall Street fluctuates on swine flu concerns;;US equities fell on Monday as investors worried about the effects of a potential swine flu pandemic.Many companies fluctuated during the session as Wall Street moved to reflect which sectors could lose and which could benefit from an outbreak after the virus reached New York.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, slumped 13.3 per cent to $4.70, while Delta Air Lines fell 14.3 per cent to $6.75. Investors were worried that travel would be the first industry to suffer if the flu continued to spread, and the Bloomberg US Airlines index suffered its heaviest intra-day fall since the session after the September 11 attacks.Tourism companies also suffered. Marriott, the hotel chain, dropped 5.1 per cent to $21.17 and Expedia, the online travel agency, fell 6.3 per cent to $10.53. Carnival, the cruise operator, lost 13.5 per cent to $24.59.Du Pont, which manufactures chemicals for the agricultural industry, led the materials sector lower amid worries about how the outbreak could affect farming. Its shares dropped 4.5 per cent to $27.50.Even credit card companies suffered because of the flu scare, as JPMorgan warned “cross-border fees may suffer from reduced cross-border travel related to the virus”. Visa lost 2.5 per cent to $58.87 and Mastercard retreated 4.4 per cent to $165.55.But Gilead Sciences, the drug company that developed the flu drug Tamiflu, and continues to receive royalties for its sales from Roche, the European company to whom it sold the licence, gained 3.8 per cent to $47.53.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent down at 857.51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.6 per cent lower at 8,025 points and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 1,679.41 points.The market briefly rallied during the morning, but later fell back, despite some analysts saying the selling was overdone. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Investors overreacted during the outbreaks of Sars and bird flu, and we saw that again this morning, as traders shot first and asked questions later.”Lawrence Summers, the chief White House economics adviser, also dented confidence when he told Fox News on Sunday that the US economy would experience “sharp declines in employment for quite some time this year”.Fears that global demand could still be some way from returning hit metals prices, and industrial companies suffered as a result. Freeport McMoRan the copper miner, lost 3.1 per cent to $39.68, while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, gave up 3.8 per cent to $8.79.The macro-economic news overshadowed earnings announcements from several leading companies, including Verizon the second-largest US telecoms company by market value, which beat analysts’ expectations, as it attracted more new customers than expected. But with revenues from business customers continuing to fall, the company’s shares lost 1.5 per cent to $30.54.Elsewhere in the sector, Qualcomm, which makes microchips for mobile phones, disappointed with its first-quarter earnings, but the company gained ground after raising its full-year revenue targets on signs that the market could be improving. Its shares picked up 4.4 per cent to $43.17.Humana, the health insurer, jumped 6.9 per cent to $29.25 after reporting a surge in first-quarter profits, easily exceeding Wall Street’s expectations and allowing it to raise its outlook for full-year profits.Corning, which makes glass for televisions, also beat analysts’ predictions, as the company said demand for its products was improving. Its shares gained 3.3 per cent to $15.84.General Motors was the strongest performer of the morning after it said it would make deep cuts to its plants and workforce and eliminate the Pontiac brand. The company also asked its bondholders to swap $27bn of debt for equity. Its shares surged 20.7 per cent to $2.04.“We didn’t see the sell-off that the pre-market session indicated,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “We’ve lived through 18 months of intense pressure after the financial collapse and we realised this flue outbreak does feel like the next wave.”

The stock lost 9 per cent to $22.44.Capital One exacerbated ongoing fears of rising bad debts in the financial sector after reporting heavier losses than expected and putting aside more money for future defaults.It raised its guidance for the amount of money it would lose from defaulted payments, saying there was “significant uncertainty” over the outlook, and its shares closed 4.5 per cent down at $14.38.The results kept the markets lower despite a rally during the day triggered
by comments from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, that the government wanted to retreat from the banking sector as soon as possible.“What Mr Geithner knows that the market does not is the results of the bank stress tests,” said Eric Ross, director of research at Cannacord Adams. “I would assume he thinks they are relatively positive or he wouldn’t be thinking we are out of the woods yet.”But neither Mr Geithner’s comments nor figures showing house prices unexpectedly rose during March were able to lift the gloom by the time the markets closed.Even Wells Fargo got caught in the late selling in spite of doubling its revenues to $21bn as more homeowners paid to refinance their mortgages.The bank sparked a steep rally earlier in the month by predicting record profits. But chief financial officer Howard Atkins sounded a more cautious note when he said he did not know what the government would say following their evaluation of lenders’ balance sheets. The company’s shares fell 3.4 per cent to $18.18.The benchmark S&P 500 index lost 0.8 per cent to 843.55 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 7,886.57 points. The Nasdaq Composite index once more outperformed the other two, gaining 0.1 per cent to 1,646.12 points.“It seems we are stuck again,” said Colin Cieszynski of CMC Markets. “We are trading in a range, and that is simply part of the bottoming process.”The Nasdaq was bolstered by Yahoo, the internet search company, which said it would cut 5 per cent of its worldwide staff after reporting earnings in line with expectations. The company’s shares gained 0.7 per cent to $14.48.Telecoms was a top performer on the S&P after AT&T reported earnings considerably ahead of estimates with revenues bolstered by customers transferring data over wireless services, especially on Apple’s iPhone. That boosted AT&T’s shares 1.8 per cent to $25.74.Apple lost 0.2 per cent to $121.51 ahead of earnings due out after the bell.Several industrial companies gained as Mr Geithner said he saw some stabilisation of global demand, helping the sector perform better than any other on the S&P.General Electric’s shares rose 0.9 per cent to $11.80 as its top executives addressed a shareholder meeting, during which Jeff Immelt, chief executive, reiterated his prediction that the company’s finance arm would make a profit for 2009.Meanwhile, Caterpillar built on the previous session’s gains, which came on the back of better-than- expected results, after JPMorgan upgraded the company to “overweight”. Its shares gained 3.4 per cent to $32.45.Boeing climbed, even though it made less profit than analysts predicted as the company kept its full-year earnings forecasts above analysts’ estimates. The stock gained 1.8 per cent to $37.30.Ingersoll-Rand, which makes refrigeration equipment, announced a narrower loss than expected and its shares rose 15.7 per cent to $19.35.Freeport McMoRan, the copper maker, bucked the trend, however, after reporting tumbling revenues and profits on weak demand and low metals prices.Its shares fell 0.7 per cent to $40.45.Elsewhere, Gilead Sciences was one of the top gainers on the S&P, advancing 5.7 per cent to $46.22 after reporting rising revenues on the back of strong sales of its Aids drugs."
314;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-04-01T20:53:38Z;Wall St buoyant on economic data;;US stocks rallied on Wednesday to take Wall Street towards its second consecutive session of gains as good economic data countered early fears about the state of the economy.Equities dropped steeply in the morning as figures showed that 742,000 jobs had been lost from the private sector during March, about 100,000 more than had been expected.But shares recovered and moved into positive territory after data from the Institute of Supply Management showed that manufacturing output and prices slowed their declines during March.That helped commodities stocks find gains after early losses triggered by falling commodity prices.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, lifted 4.2 per cent to $39.71, while Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer gained 3.5 per cent to $7.60.Steel companies performed especially well, with US Steel lifting 7.1 per cent to $22.62 and AK Steel gaining 9.1 per cent to $7.77.The manufacturing data along with figures showing that mortgage applications had also risen, helped financial companies find gains.Citigroup rose 5.9 per cent to $2.68 and Bank of Americagained 3.4 per cent to $7.05.Investors were also keen to buy banks ahead of Wednesday’s announcement from the Financial Accounting Standards Board on mark-to-market accounting, which has been blamed for exacerbating banks’ capital problems.Insurers performed well, with Prudential gaining 7.8 per cent to $20.50, Lincoln National picking up 5.7 per cent to $7.07 and Metlife lifting 2.9 per cent to $23.43.Aflac was one of the only insurers to fall after S&P downgraded hybrid debt issued by more than 60 European firms. Aflac said in February that downgrades of such securities could force it to take more writedowns this year. Its shares lost 3.2 per cent to $18.75“The jobs data spooked the market, but there are now some indications that we are starting to see a levelling off of the economic slump,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.7 per cent to 811.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 2 per cent to 7,761.60 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.5 per cent to 1,551.60.Telecoms were the biggest risers on the S&P, led higher by QWest which is considering selling its long haul network, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. With Verizon and AT&T said to be possible buyers, QWest’s shares rose 9.7 per cent to $3.75.General Motors fell for a third consecutive session, however, weighed by further talk of bankruptcy, as the New York Times reported that the Obama administration was looking to lead the company into a “controlled” bankruptcy. GM’s shares lost 0.5 per cent to $1.93.But Jerry Webman, chief economist at Oppenheimer Funds, said that while the possible bankruptcy was not good news for GM shareholders, the increased certainty about the status of the company had helped calm the wider market.“There has been more clarity from Washington over automotives, and that is lending some stability to stocks,” he said.Healthcare stocks proved the biggest drag on the benchmark S&P 500 index, after Celgene the drug maker, warned about revenues coming in at the lower end of forecasts, saying it expected 2009 profits of about $2.05 per share. It lost 13.4 per cent to $38.47.Many investors were waiting for further news from the G20 meeting in London.Taro Aso, the Japanese prime minister, warned in an interview with the FT of the serious consequences of not agreeing another globally co-ordinated stimulus plan. But Mr Cardillo of Avalon said he believed that Wall Street would only move if there was a total breakdown of relations at the meeting.“The market is not going to hang its hat on the G20. Unless there’s an indication that protectionism might come into play the market will ignore it.”Apollo Group, the University of Phoenix’s parent company, fell in spite of better-than-expectesd quarterly earnings. Investors were spooked by warnings of slowing margin growth and of the university facing increased regulatory oversight. Its shares lost 15.2 per cent to $66.46.
315;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-03-31T21:19:24Z;Wall Street financials bounce back;;"Wall Street rallied on Tuesday, taking the benchmark S&P 500 index to its best month since 2002 as buyers eyed bargains after Monday’s heavy sell-offs.The previous session’s losses had come after the White House rejected General Motors’ restructuring plans and replaced Rick Wagoner as chairman and chief executive.Financials also suffered after several European governments were forced to bail out domestic lenders.Some analysts said Monday’s selling was overdone, and on Tuesday much of the market appeared to feel the same, with financial shares the biggest risers.Banks extended their rally in the afternoon as the TED spread, the difference between what banks and the Treasury pay to borrow over three months, fell below 1 per cent for the first time in March, suggesting increased confidence in the banking sector.Bank of America, one of Monday’s heaviest fallers, gained 13.1 per cent to $6.82, while Citigroup rose 9.5 per cent to $2.53 and Wells Fargo picked up 6.5 per cent to $14.24.Lincoln National, the insurer, which had been the previous session’s biggest faller, gained 4.4 per cent to $6.69, although earlier rose more than 20 per cent, after saying it would repay $500m of debt next Monday, a move that eased investor fears about its finances.The S&P rose 1.3 per cent to 797.87 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.2 per cent to 7,608.92 points. The S&P gained 8.5 per cent during March, the best monthly gain in over six years. But it finished the quarter more than 11 per cent lower.“In a bear market, the rallies are the most violent but in a bull market the falls are the most violent. The fact that we saw a fierce drop on Monday, but have risen again today shows we are in a bull move,” said John Brady, chief investment strategist at MF Global.The Nasdaq Composite index outperformed the other market measures after Davenport upgraded Microsoft to “buy” from “neutral”, saying there was increased PC demand in China and the US.Microsoft gained 5.1 per cent to $18.37 and the Nasdaq as a whole rose 1.8 per cent to 1,528.59 points.“There has been some strengthening in consumer orders across the technology sector, and we’ve also noticed a bit of a pick-up in the supply chain,” said Ben Reitzes, an analyst at
Barclays Capital.Fords shares fell 4.7 per cent to $2.63 as the automotive sector continued to struggle. The company announced yesterday it would cover 12 months’ worth of payments from customers who lost their jobs “for economic reasons”.GM also continued to slump, losing 28.2 per cent to $1.94 after Fritz Henderson, the company’s new chief executive, talked openly about bankruptcy.Another of Monday’s heavy fallers, Alcoa rose after Deutsche Bank upgraded its shares, saying fears had receded that the company would need to refinance after it generated about $2bn in asset and equities sales in March. Alcoa’s shares rose 9.7 per cent to $7.34. But Deutsche Bank was less positive about
fellow metal producer,
Freeport McMoRan.The bank said the copper miner was likely to suffer after a recent rally on the prospect of lower copper prices. Its shares fell 1.1 per cent to $38.11.In the housing sector, homebuilder Lennar reported a wider loss than had been expected, at $0.98 per share for the first quarter. Revenues plunged 44 per cent during that time and the company’s shares lost 13.8 per cent to $7.51.Its peer KB Home also suffered after Lennar’s results, and the release of data showing that prices of US single-family homes dropped 19 per cent in January on the year, worse than analysts had predicted. KB’s shares fell 4.2 per cent to $13.18.Investors found some relief from the level of consumer confidence, which rose off its historic lows for February, although by less than predicted.But business activity fell during the month, according to data from the Chicago Purchasers Index, against expectations of a modest rise.Ingersoll-Rand, the industrial services company, fell 1.3 per cent to $13.80 after slashing its dividend to 7 cents per share in order to save $140m a year.."
316;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-03-27T20:35:22Z;Flagging financial stocks a drag on Wall Street;;US stocks dropped on Friday after a third consecutive positive week put the benchmark S&P 500 index on course for its highest monthly rise since 1991.Financial stocks were the heaviest fallers, with banks slumping after Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan and Ken Lewis, head of Bank of America said results had deteriorated in March.Mr Dimon also said he had no timetable for repaying money taken from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp).He was talking after a meeting between bank bosses and President Barack Obama. All parties said it had been a constructive meeting, but Mr Dimon’s comments caused JPMorgan’s shares to fall nearly 4 per cent in two minutes.JPMorgan’s shares closed 5.8 per cent down at $27.40, while Citigroup ended 6.8 per cent lower at $2.62 and Bank of America fell 3.2 per cent to $7.34.Tech stocks also gave up some of their gains after a strong week. Intelregistered $1bn of stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission late on Thursday for potential use in acquisitions.Although it did not name a specific target, its shares fell on the news, losing 2.5 per cent to $15.42 in morning trade.Other technology companies also looked set to pare recent gains. Apple lost 2.8 per cent to $106.85. Microsoftfell 3.7 per cent to $18.13 and IBM gave up 4.7 per cent to $94.15.The S&P 500 lost 2 per cent to 815.94 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 1.9 per cent to 7,776.18 points and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.6 per cent to 1,545.20 points.But the three indices are now up between 6 and 7 per cent for the week, holding on to gains made on the back of US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner’s plan to clear banks’ balance sheets.Some analysts warned that the recent rally, which has taken the S&P up 11.1 per cent for the month to date, is not based on any fundamental improvement to the outlook for companies.Noting that the market was adopting a wait-and-see approach, Jerry Webman, chief economist at Oppenheimer Funds, said: “If we see an improvement in earnings when they are reported, we should see a lot of people enter the market but I think the big name companies will struggle to do that.”Data showing that personal spending rose 0.2 per cent for February failed to lift stocks, with most analysts having predicted similar figures.Homebuilder KB Homereported a loss for the first quarter before the market opened but this was narrower than analysts had predicted.The US Department of Commerce said this week that purchases of new homes had unexpectedly risen for February and KB’s results reflected some of that strength. Its shares gained 6.3 per cent to $15.05.General Motors also performed well, gaining 6.2 per cent to $3.62 after the FT reported that it was creating a third version of its viability plan to take account of continued weakness from new vehicle sales.It was also helped by Bloomberg reports that the company might sell a stake in its European operation, Opel, as part of plans to raise €3.3bn.Commodity prices fell however, having hit highs for the year on Thursday. Metals prices fell and Newmont Mining, the gold miner, lost 2.7 per cent to $45.65. Freeport McMoRan, which also mines gold, lost 2.2 per cent to $42.12. Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer, gave up 3.9 per cent to $7.80.Oil prices fell, having hit highs for the year earlier in the week, and shares in energy companies followed them downwards. Chevron dropped 1.8 per cent to $68.90 and ExxonMobil fell 1.8 per cent to $69.98.But there was good news for JC Penney after JPMorgan upgraded the company, saying it was close to renegotiating its debt, which has been a weight on the share price. Its shares rose 6.7 per cent to $21.49.
317;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Wall Street rallies despite falling financials;;"US stocks rallied strongly on Thursday to put the benchmark S&P 500 index on course for its biggest monthly gain since 1974.Strength in the cash-rich technology sector, meanwhile, meant the Nasdaq Composite index is now in positive territory for the year.The S&P 500 rose 2.3 per cent to 832.86 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.3 per cent to 7,924.56. The Nasdaq Composite index surged 3.8 per cent to 1,587, putting it 0.6 per cent up for 2009.Technology stocks continued their good performance for the year. Apple gained 3.2 per cent to $109.87 and Hewlett Packard rose 7.1 per cent to $33.20.Paychex, the payroll services company, was the biggest gainer on the index, up 9.6 per cent to $25.88 after it reported better results than expected.This came despite weakness in the banking sector after Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said there would be “new rules of the game” for financial regulation.Confidence in the sector was already fragile after Moody’s, the credit ratings agency, downgraded Bank of America’s debt and investors took the opportunity to take profits after a month’s strong gains.Bank of America fell 1.6 per cent to $7.58, Citigroup dropped 4.8 per cent to $2.81 and Wells Fargo lost 2.9 per cent to $15.95.“Any time there is any dose of uncertainty addedto the landscape, investors are going to take profits,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at
The Hartford.The market also continued to adjust to Mr Geithner’s plan to clear the banks of their toxic assets, with some analysts warning it might be bad for banks’ shareholders in the long run.“It might save the banks, but that doesn’t mean it will save their shareholders,” he said. “They might be left with something that’s not particularly profitable,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.The banking falls were exacerbated by figures showing that the US economy continues to deteriorate, with the number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits hitting record highs.Gross domestic product, meanwhile, fell 6.3 per cent on an annualised basis in the last three months of 2008, although this was better than analysts expected.But banks failed to drag down the market as better- than-expected company results and rising commodity prices counteracted negative economic data.Shares also rallied strongly in the afternoon after a successful auction of seven-year Treasury notes raised hopes the government would be able to fund its stimulus plans.Strong commodities helped industrial companies perform better than any other sector. As metals prices rose, mining companies saw the benefit. Newmont Mining gained 2.3 per cent to $46.90 and Freeport McMoRan picked up 5.9 per cent to $43.05. Caterpillar, which makes mining machinery, rose 6.5 per cent to $30.78.Consumer companies also performed well after positive results showed consumer spending had not collapsed as badly as feared.In the food and drinks sector, Conagra and Dr Pepper Snapple exceeded expectations.Conagra, the frozen food maker, rose 9.2 per cent to $16.99 after it said it expected its consumer foods business, which accounts for the majority of its sales, to improve in the second half of the fiscal year.Dr Pepper Snapple gained 15.2 per cent to $17.87, having made 39 cents in earnings per share excluding certain items.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, provided further evidence that consumer spending remained more resilient than estimated as it reported better revenues and earnings than expected.The company forecast that it would beat analysts’ predictions for its 2010 profits. It was one of the highest risers in the S&P, jumping 12.6 per cent to $37.67.The figures helped lift other consumer companies including Wal-Mart, which rose 2.1 per cent to $52.76.General Motors surged after reports said the company had agreed plans
with 6,000 of its staff who belong to the United Auto Workers union to take buy-out offers. This was more than analysts had expected, and GM’s stock rose 14.1 per cent to $3.41."
318;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-03-24T20:44:11Z;M Stanley bucks trend as bank stocks tumble;;"US stocks suffered a late sell off, but managed to hold on to most of the gains made during the previous session on the back of a new plan to clear banks’ balance sheets.The details of the public-private investment programme (PPIP) from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, on Monday sparked the biggest rally on the S&P since an interest rate cut last October.By Tuesday morning, investors looked a little more cautious. Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said: “The BKX [banking index] did not move above last Thursday’s high and there may also be an over-reaction to the PPIP plan.”Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said potential investors in the new plan would not be retroactively penalised. Investors, however, focused on the continuing poor outlook for banks and took the opportunity to take profits.Citigroup closed down 4.5 per cent to $2.99, Bank of America fell 7.1 per cent at $7.25, while Wells Fargo was one of the worst performing banks, ending 10.3 per cent lower at $15.55.Morgan Stanley managed to find gains as investors bet that it would be in a better position than most to attract private investors from the PPIP. Its shares rose 2.9 per cent to $25.13.The equities market was also helped after the Mortgage Bankers Association said that demand would rise this year.This positive message added to the news that home prices for February had risen 1.7 per cent, with most analyst having expected a fall.The price of oil ended its recent rally and closed just 3 cents up. Energy stocks fell, with Exxon Mobil losing 1.5 per cent to $69.46.Commodities companies were also led lower by the falling prices of their products. Freeport McMoRan, the copper manufacturer, lost 2.4 per cent to $40.85, while Newport Mining dropped 1.8 per cent to $43.86.But confidence grew that the fall in steel prices might be coming to an end.
This helped AK Steel pick up 21.5 per cent to $8.02, while US Steel gained 6 per cent to $23.41.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 2 per cent to 806.39 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.5 per cent to 7,660.45 points and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.4 per cent to 1,518.84 points.All three remain about 15 per cent up for the month.Eric Ross, director of research at Cannacord Adams, said: “This rally is real, but I do worry about the effect that some of the issues in Europe could yet have on the US.”In spite of the hesitancy from some buyers, a number of analysts remained confident about the medium-term outlook for equities.“We might be in for one of those exciting rallies you get during a base-building process,” said Mary Ann Bartels, analyst at Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch.“Some of the fund managers with cash might feel under pressure to come into the market before the end of the quarter and if they do we are not looking for a big pull back.”Industrial stocks managed to avoid the worst of the falls seen in other sectors. General Electric fell only 0.7 per cent to $10.36 after Deutsche Bank said it did not think that GE would need to raise more external capital from equity and maintained its “hold” recommendation on the company’s shares.There was bad news for the media sector as Goldman Sachs cut its recommendations for Disney. Goldman said the company was trading at a 25 per cent premium to its peers, and cut it from “buy” to “neutral”. Disney’s shares fell 2.8 per cent to $18.39.General Motors lost 6.6 per cent to $3.13 as discussions with the company’s bondholders seem to remain at a standstill.There were rumours of further consolidation in the healthcare sector, with unconfirmed reports from dealReporter that GlaxoSmithKline was interested in bidding for Allergan the pharmaceutical company and maker of the Botox wrinkle treatment.Allergan’s shares were the best performing on the S&P, up 12.5 per cent to $48.58.In spite of the falls in stocks, the Vix index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, also fell, suggesting that investors were starting to become more confident that the market was finding a bottom."
319;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-03-18T19:52:04Z;US stocks spike on Fed plan;;US stocks surged on Wednesday afternoon, taking the S&P briefly back over 800, as the Federal Reserve announced unprecedented measures to clear financial companies’ balance sheets and stimulate the economy.The unexpected move by the Federal Reserve to buy $300bn in long-term Treasury bonds and an additional $750bn in mortgage-backed securities delighted investors, with financial stocks feeling the most benefit.The benchmark S&P 500 index spiked after the announcement, and was 1.6 per cent up at 790.8 shortly before the close, having hit a high of 803.04. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 7,642.6 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.6 per cent to 1,486.16.Banks were the biggest risers, having also been boosted by reports from Bloomberg that the Treasury was ready to expand the term asset-backed relief program (Talf) also to help clear balance sheets. The troubled Citigroup lifted 22.7 per cent to $3.08.Bank of America, whose chief executive, Ken Lewis, earlier said would be able to repay $45bn in government money from the troubled asset relief program (Tarp), picked up 17.2 per cent to $7.35.Fifth Third gained after it declared a dividend of $0.01 a share, helping to push its stock up 13.9 per cent to $2.22.Insurers also felt the benefit of the Fed’s boldness, with Metlife rising 25.8 per cent to 25.17 and Prudential gaining 19 per cent to $24.02.Morgan Stanley fell, however, after JPMorgan, as part of its new coverage of the company, said that it would need more capital. It dropped 0.6 per cent to $23.68.“The Fed needed to act with buying these assets and injecting money into the banks by printing money to capitalise the banks,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.But others were more sceptical about the effectiveness of the Fed’s plan. Joe Clark, managing partner at Financial Enhancement Group, said it could actually be bad news for stocks. “I don’t think that many people would view that as a good thing, especially when China has said it is already concerned about US debt. There could be some serious consequences if we were to anger China.”The technology sector continued its recent good performance after it emerged IBM was in advanced talks to buy its smaller rival Sun Microsystems for $10 per share, more than double Tuesday’s closing price. The news sent shares in Sun soaring 77.5 per cent to $8.82 while IBM slipped 2 per cent to $91.01.“The recent buying of tech stocks shows we have hit the bottom. You wouldn’t buy growth stocks if you didn’t think the economy was going to recover,” said Mr Pado.The Fed’s move came despite data released on Wednesday morning showing consumer prices in the US rose more than expected in February, with the consumer price index gaining 0.4 per cent, easing worries over deflation.Corporate earnings from General Mills, the food producer which makes Cheerios, came in below estimates as high costs took their toll, sending its shares down 11.4 per cent to $47.55.But there was better news from Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains which beat analysts’ forecasts for its third quarter earnings. Its shares rose 18.6 per cent to $35.47.Gains in industrial stocks were limited after the World Bank cut its forecast for economic growth in China, fuelling worries over global demand for materials.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 1.7 per cent to $37.57, while Caterpillar, which produces machinery for both US and Chinese miners, gained 1.9 per cent to $27.33.Nucor, the steel manufacturer, rose 5 per cent to $35.22. The shares had suffered earlier after JPMorgan cut its 2009 earnings forecast for the company by 75 per share.Energy stocks put a moderate drag on the market’s gains, rising only slightly after oil prices came off their recent lows. Chevron picked up 1.6 per cent to $66.36 and Exxon Mobil rose 0.1 per cent to $69.16. The shares were hit in part by profit taking, with the sector having gained more than10 per cent between the beginning of last week and the end of Tuesday.
320;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-03-18T13:03:11Z;Wall St anxious before Fed decision;;Reports of a possible major acquisition were not able to tempt US investors out of their caution on Wednesday morning as equities markets waited for details from the Federal Reserve on what action would be taken on asset purchase schemes.IBM was reported in the Wall Street Journal as being in talks to buy its smaller rival Sun Microsystems for at least $6.5bn, nearly 100 per cent above its market capitalisation at the end of Tuesday’s trading. The news sent shares in Sun up 66 per cent to $8.25 while IBM slipped 3.1 per cent to $89.99 before the bell. The companies refused to comment.The increased activity in the tech sector helped futures for the Nasdaq Composite index outperform those for the benchmark S&P 500 index or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Less than an hour before the opening bell, futures for the Nasdaq were 3 points down at 1,187.2, while those for the S&P were 5.8 points lower at 769.5 while the Dow Jones lost 68 points to 7,286. On a fair value basis, however, which takes into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract, both the S&P and Nasdaq were higher.Hopes for “quantitative easing” from the Federal Reserve were fading on Wednesday, but investors were still waiting to hear if it might buy long-term Treasury bills in an effort to stimulate the economy.Joe Balestrino, fixed income strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Such a step may act to further soothe credit markets already calmed somewhat by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who mixed upbeat comments about the economy over the long-term with an understanding of what is needed to get from here to there in comments during a rare interview with CBS’ ’60 Minutes’ on Sunday.”The Fed may be less anxious to get into such asset purchase schemes after data released on Wednesday morning showed consumer prices in the US rose more than expected in February, with the consumer price index gaining 0.4 per cent, easing worries over deflation.Mortgage applications were also higher, adding to the confidence given to financial and homebuilder stocks on Monday by data showing more new houses were started in February than had been predicted.Corporate earnings from General Mills on Wednesday came in below estimates as high costs took their toll, sending its shares down 3.5 per cent to $51.81 in pre-market trade.But there was better news from Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains which beat analysts’ forecasts for its third quarter earnings. Its shares rose 10.4 per cent to $33.00 before the bell.Industrial stocks looked set for falls after the World Bank cut its forecast for economic growth in China, fuelling worries over global demand for materials. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, fell 0.8 per cent before the open to $36.64, while Caterpillar, which produces machinery for both US and Chinese miners, fell 1.8 per cent to $26.35.Nucor, the steel manufacturer, fell 1.8 per cent to $32.95 on the news from China. The company was also hit when JPMorgan cut its 2009 earnings forecast for the company by 75 per cent.Bad news from China also weighed on Coca-Cola before the bell, as the company said it was “disappointed” by the Chinese government’s rejection of a $2.3bn bid for China Huiyuan Juice Group.

321;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-03-17T20:01:00Z;Wall Street boosted by strong housing data;;"US stocks staged a financials-led rally on Tuesday on housing data that was much better than expected.Figures showing that building had started on many more houses than expected during February gave equities the spur to continue the rising trend of last week.Citigroup continued its gains, rising 7.7 per cent to $2.51 and JPMorgan added 8.9 per cent to $25.14.Builders KB Home and Lennar rose 9.3 per cent to $11.12 and 8.7 per cent to $8.52 respectively.Producer prices also managed to edge upwards, by 0.1 per cent, allaying fears of deflation and further bolstering consumer companies.The retail sector as a whole also benefited from an upgrade by Jefferies International for seven companies, including Home Depot and Lowe’s, which rose 6.7 per cent to $21.48 and 6.2 per cent to $16.42 respectively.Even American Express found some gains in spite of reporting on Monday that higher numbers of people had trouble paying their credit card bills in February. Its shares rose 1.9 per cent to $12.91.“Delinquency rates will rise with unemployment, but I don’t think losses from the credit card sector is the next big surprise for the market,” said Bruce Harting, at Barclays Capital.The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 3.2 per cent to 778.12 points.The Nasdaq Composite index performed better, gaining 4.1 per cent to 1,462.11 points as technology stocks rose, having been heavily sold during the previous
session.Cisco, which on Monday announced it was to make servers for data systems, was named a “conviction buy” by Goldman Sachs.Its shares rose 4.5 per cent to $16.14.Dell also gained after saying it would launch an ultra-thin notebook computer this month to compete with Apple and Hewlett-Packard. Dell’s shares picked up 4.9 per cent to $9.34.Apple rose 4.4 per cent to $99.66 after it announced the third version of its iPhone.The rise came in spite of research group NPD saying that the company had sold 16 per cent fewer Apple Mac computers in February than in January.The news on the iPhone helped AT&T, the only network available with that model, rise 4.2 per cent to $25.37. Verizon also gained, picking up 4.5 per cent to $29.83.The Dow Jones Industrial index made smaller gains, weighed down by two of the country’s biggest metal producers as falling demand continued to take its toll. The index closed 2.5 per cent up at 7,395.70 points.Alcoa’s shares dropped after the aluminium producer said it would cut its dividend from $0.17 to $0.03, issue stock and convertible notes and trim its 2010 spending in an effort to weather weak demand.The shares fell on Monday night and continued to lose ground on Tuesday, dropping 8.7 per cent to $5.59.There was similar bad news from the steel sector, as Nucor, the country’s largest steel manufacturer, forecast a first quarter loss that was worse than expected. Dan DiMicco, chief executive, said there was “no visibility as to the timing of the [economic] recovery”. The shares fell 9.2 per cent to $33.55.Nucor was joined by other big names in steel making, including AK Steel, which fell 1.8 per cent to $6.04, and US Steel, losing 3.2 per cent to $17.81. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, also fell, dropping 0.9 per cent to $36.93.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said: “The move by Alcoa to issue shares and cut its dividend is a sign that commodity demand is weak despite excitement over Chinese buying and hopes for an economic recovery in Asia.”Energy stocks rose as the price of crude oil picked up. Chevron gained 3.8 per cent to $65.31 and Exxon Mobil rose 3.2 per cent to $69.09.Pfizer launched a $13.5bn debt sale to fund its purchase of fellow drugmaker Wyeth. Its shares rose 0.8 per cent to $14.26.The Federal Reserve is due to announce on Wednesday whether it is willing to purchase assets on a large scale.Joe Balestrino, fixed income strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Such a step may act to further soothe credit markets already calmed somewhat by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke.”"
322;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-03-09T22:14:02Z;Congo miners suffer as boom turns to bust;;From the depths of the waterlogged Luiswishi mine, a warning cry pierces the late afternoon calm. A dust-covered teenage boy pops up from beneath a jagged ledge, looking around nervously.A second boy emerges, then a third, one with a pickaxe, another a spade, and all three with sacks of rock slung over their shoulders. A security guard slinks into view, swinging a rifle casually in one hand, and the boys take flight.In the Democratic Republic of Congo’s copper belt, this is what passes for commercial activity. It boomed in recent years but is now suffering a bust that has shown up the failures of the good times: big western mining companies missed out on the best of the high prices, while small-time opportunists exacerbated the sector’s notorious venality.The copper belt that cuts through Katanga province sucked in people and investment as the copper price peaked at nearly $9,000 a tonne last August. Experts said that in a decade it could have been producing 800,000-1m tonnes of copper a year.But after a spate of closures forced by the global economic downturn, industry executives say that artisanal miners – ragged illegal diggers like the three boys with swag bags – are probably producing more than companies in Katanga.Official production at Luiswishi, a giant amphi­theatre dotted with the glistening green tips of underground copper/cobalt deposits, was suspended in December by its concessionaire, the Forrest Group, an unlisted Belgian company. Forrest has kept three other mines open, but out of more than 200 companies in Katanga it is one of only eight that are producing, says Paul Franssen, a Forrest executive.Paul Fortin, head of Gécamines, the state-owned miner and joint venture partner for more than 30 big foreign companies, says: “It’s very, very tough. We’re bleeding here. My meagre production is not enough to cover my costs.”In Congo the aftertaste of the boom is more sour still for some big companies from the US, Australia, South Africa and Canada.Until the end of a 1998-2003 regional war, foreign companies were reluctant to invest in Congo – although many bought mining rights. As a result Katanga’s boom started three to four years after that of Zambia.When it began there were big plans, such as Freeport-McMoRan’s $1bn-plus development of Tenke Fungurume, an unmined copper concession that has potential to produce a record-breaking 400,000 tonnes a year. But many stalled in early 2007 when the government initiated a review of 61 contracts signed during the war when the government needed the signature bonuses to fund its fighting. Independent studies concluded the contracts contained irregularities that disadvantaged the state. Renegotiations dragged on, freezing investment plans as financiers grew jittery.Two companies are holding out against the government and they control what could be Katanga’s two most valuable mining projects: Freeport and First Quantum Minerals, developer of the $300m (€237m, £217m) Kolwezi Tailings project. For others, any post-negotiation surge of enthusiasm for development was snuffed out by the financial crisis.In other parts of Katanga’s mining sector, fly-by-night operators undermined the industry’s sustainability and the welfare of its workers, according to social activists. “I’d said before: ‘I don’t trust this boom. It’s artificial. It’s speculation’,” says Moïse Katumbi, the governor of Katanga province.His words were given credence by more than 40 Chinese smelter owners who had been shipping copper to refineries in China but fled Katanga after the bust. In an effort to promote more high-value processing, the government banned the export of raw copper during the boom, but the system was routinely circumvented.Mr Katumbi estimates there were 250,000 artisanal miners as copper prices peaked. ACIDH, a Congolese human rights group, says conditions across the sector were “deplorable”.For the three boys scrambling to carry their Luiswishi swag bags into a moribund market – as well as for mining companies – the disappointment of a boom that promised more wealth than it delivered is making the bust more bitter still.
323;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-03-05T22:28:10Z;Financials lead sharp Wall Street reversal;;"US stocks slumped to new lows for the year on Thursday in New York, wiping out the gains made during the previous bullish session.Financials once again led the selling after Moodys, the ratings agency, warned that JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, three of the largest US banks by capitalisation, may face credit-rating downgrades.JPMorgan’s stock fell 14 per cent to $16.60 on the news and Bank of America slid 11.7 per cent to $3.17. Wells Fargo, which continues to drop on worries that it will cut its dividend, lost 15.9 per cent to $8.12.Citigroup also fell, with fears over its creditworth-iness reflected in record highs in the price of insuring against the bank defaulting on its debt. On Thursday it cost $525,000 to insure $10m of Citi’s debt. Citi shares dipped below $1 for the first time in the company’s history. By the close they were 9.7 per cent lower at $1.02. The banks were further hit by news that US mortgage delinquencies were up by 1 per cent, with one in every eight mortgage-holding households ending 2008 behind on their payments or in the foreclosure process.US Bancorp was one of the most heavily sold, despite offering to give back $6bn of Troubled Asset Relief Program funds. Its shares fell 18.2 per cent to $9.01.Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab said: “Financials will not stabilise until we see some good news, either by more banks paying back money from Tarp or by the big banks reporting reduced losses when the earnings season comes around.”Bill Knapp, investment strategist at New York Life, said the selling had reached similar levels to those seen last autumn. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw Washington bring in another temporary ban on short selling,” he commented.The S&P 500 fell 4.3 per cent to 682.55, its lowest since September 1996. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 4.1 per cent to 6,594.44 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 4 per cent to 1,299.59.Shares in material and industrial stocks retreated after rising on Wednesday following talk that the Chinese government was ready to introduce a fresh stimulus package to encourage spending.The announcement never came, and three of the previous session’s biggest winners dipped. However, the assertion from Chinese premier Wen Jiabao that the country would meet its 8 per cent growth target for the year meant they did not cede all of Wednesday’s gains. Nucor, the steelmaker, lost 7.7 per cent to $32.07 and Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gave up 1.7 per cent to $31.65. Caterpillar, which sells mining equipment in the US and China, dropped 7.7 per cent to $23.49.The news from China also brought the oil price down after its strong performance on Wednesday, hampering energy stocks. Chevronfell 4.8 per cent to $56.46 and Exxon Mobil gave up 5.3 per cent to $62.22.There was yet more bad news for the distressed car industry.Auditors for General Motors said there was “substantial doubt” that it could continue to function as a going concern for the next 30 days. Even though the assessment had been forecast, its confirmation sent GM shares down 15.5 per cent to $1.86.Meanwhile Ford said on Wednesday night that it would look to negotiate a debt-for-equity swap with its creditors. The prospect of equity dilution sent it 3.2 per cent lower at $1.81.General Electric managed to pare early losses after Keith Sherin, chief financial officer, reassured the markets that the company did not need new capital. Its shares closed 0.5 per cent down at $6.66.Budget retailers continue to perform well, and after Wednesday’s better-than-
expected profits from Big Lots, Wal-Mart on Thursday reported a 5.1 per cent rise in February sales at stores open at least a year. Its stock rose 2.6 per cent to $49.75. But Wal-Mart’s figures disguised a wider slump in retail sales, which fell 4.8 per cent in February compared with the same time a year ago, once Wal-Mart had been excluded.Hewlett-Packard belied the recent outperformance by technology stocks after a report from research firm IDC said that PC sales would fall 4.5 per cent this year worldwide. HP shares fell 4.3 per cent to $20.25."
324;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-03-04T22:04:32Z;Wall Street lifted by Chinese stimulus plans;;General Electric, once the biggest company in the world by capitalisation, on Wednesday saw its share price dip to a low not seen since 1991 during an otherwise positive day on Wall Street.GE was forced to issue a statement tackling rumours it would have to raise fresh capital as the cost of insuring against the company’s finance arm defaulting on its debt spiked.After falling steeply in early trade it the company’s shares bounced slightly when the company said it had “acted aggressively” to adapt to the current recession and had ”no plans to raise additional equity”. They ended the day down 4.6 per cent at $6.69.That went against the general trend of the day, which saw all three major indices rising on hopes that China could shore up global demand, with a fresh stimulus package from Beijing widely expected.Metal producers were amongst the biggest gainers, with Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, picking up 13.4 per cent to $32.21. Nucor, the steel manufacturer, and Alcoa, the aluminium maker, also saw gains, rising 8.1 per cent to $34.73 and 12.8 per cent to $6.24 respectively.The news from Beijing also helped had an effect on oil prices, and US crude rose $3.51 to $45.16 per barrel. This was followed by energy companies, including Chevron, which rose 2.7 per cent to $59.28 and Exxon Mobil, which gained 2.1 per cent to $65.68.Caterpillar, which supplies machinery to domestic mining markets and to China directly, was a big gainer, rising 13.2 per cent to $25.44.A potential uptick in demand from Asia also helped technology stocks, which have been heavily sold during the first couple of months of 2009. Applepicked up 3.2 to $91.17 while Cisco rose 6 per cent to $15.25.“The sector got badly beaten up at the start of the year, but the news out of China has encouraged some buyers,” said Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman.The S&P 500 rose 2.4 per cent to 712.87, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.2 per cent to 6,875.84 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.5 per cent to 1,353.74.Financial stocks were the worst performing sector on the S&P, however, despite further details from Washington on the Obama administration’s $275bn plan to help homeowners avoid defaulting on their mortgages. Tim Geithner, Treasury Secretary, said that mortgage providers could start reducing borrowers’ payments immediately.“The mortgage plan is a great idea,” said Pran Tiku, chief investment officer at Peak Financial. “It will allow some homeowners to refinance and so should relieve pressure on financial stocks.”But others have warned that the administration is not being sufficiently friendly towards equity markets, in spite of President Obama’s reassurance on Tuesday that “buying stocks is a potentially good deal”.“The market will find selling pressure until Washington decides to address the market’s decline via policies which are friendly toward capital formation and investment,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Banks were down, with Citigroup falling 7.4 per cent to $1.13, and Bank of America dropping 1.4 per cent to $3.59. US Bancorp added significant pressure to the sector after becoming the latest large company to cut its dividend, reducing it from 42.5 cents to just 5 cents per share. Its shares fell 12.5 per cent to $11.01.This leaves Wells Fargo as the largest traditional commercial bank not to cut its dividend, and fears that it would soon do so sent the company’s stock down 9.5 per cent to $9.66.Insurers rallied after Tuesday’s falls on news that 12 life insurers have applied for capital injections from the Treasury in order to buy local lenders.MetLife rose 7.3 per cent to $14.72, while Lincoln National and Prudential gained 9.2 per cent to $7.16 and 7.1 per cent to $13.82 respectively.But the overall fall in the financial sector reflected fears in the credit markets about the security of those companies’ debts.The CDR Counterparty Risk Index, a measure of the counterparty risk in the sector, was at its highest level this morning since September last year, went Lehman Brothers went bust.
325;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-03-03T21:53:13Z;Insurers and financials foil Wall Street;;"The benchmark S&P 500 index closed the day below the 700 points level for the first time since October 1996 in a choppy trading session dominated by news coming from Washington.Share prices fluctuated as President Barack Obama, Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the federal reserve, all spoke in what appeared to be a concerted effort to calm the markets after heavy sell-offs during the last week.But the effort appeared to have failed in the short term, with all three major indices closing down on Tuesday. The S&P lost 0.6 per cent to 696.33 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 6,726.02 points and the Nasdaq dropped 0.1 per cent to 1,321.01 points.Insurers led the afternoon’s retreat during Mr Bernanke’s testimony to a senate committee. Mr Bernanke said that the stricken insurer AIG had been a “hedge fund basically that was attached to a large and stable insurance company”. His words triggered fears about how exposed other insurers were to AIG.Metlife fell 16.9 per cent to $13.72. Lincoln National, which was hit by a ratings downgrade from Fitch, closed 14.9 per cent down at $6.56. Prudential lost 12.6 per cent to $12.90.After an early rally as bargain hunters looked to take advantage of low prices after Monday’s heavy falls, there was a mixed picture for the banks by the closing bell.Citigroup finished 1.7 per cent higher at $1.22 while Bank of America rose, in spite of being downgraded by S&P, the rating agency. It finished 0.6 per cent up at $3.65. Wells Fargo lost 1.6 per cent to $10.67.The early gains were eroded during Mr Bernanke’s testimony.Dave Rovell, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams, said: “It was the aggressive questioning from senators that weighed especially heavily. One spent a long time calling for nationalisation, putting pressure on financial stocks.”In the afternoon, Tim Geithner launched the term asset-backed securities loan facility, but the markets were left hungry for further details, and his words failed to spark a recovery.Mr Obama was even moved to give his own bullish assessment of stocks during the afternoon, saying, “Profit and earning ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal.”Industrial stocks rose on speculation that China, the world’s biggest metal purchaser, could soon start to buy in large quantities.Metal companies performed particularly well. Freeport McMoRan, the copper producer, gained 7.3 per cent to $28.41, while Nucorp, which makes steel, rose by
4.5 per cent to $32.12.Energy stocks followed the price of oil higher. Consol Energy, which suffered in the previous session after announcing the temporary closure of its Buchanan coal mine in Virginia, gained 4.4 per cent to $32.57. Chevronalso picked up, rising 0.2 per cent to $57.73.GE, which dropped sharply on Monday after the announcement last week of the company’s first dividend cut since 1938, continued to lose ground, falling 7.8 per cent to $7.01.“GE looks relatively cheap but the company has
really very little in tangible assets,” said Steve Lehman from Federated Investors. There were also concerns that the company would soon have to raise capital.In the technology sector, Apple announced it would release a new Macbook laptop computer. Its shares rose 0.5 per cent to $88.37.Dell gained, in spite of a report on Monday from technology researcher Gartner that forecast an 11.9 per cent drop in personal computer sales this year. It gained 8.5 per cent to $9.15.There was more bad economic news as the number of pending US home sales, those for which contracts have been signed but the purchaser has not yet moved, fell by 7.7 per cent in January, more than twice as much as expected.The home building sector fell 7.5 per cent on the pending sales figure, and real estate stocks followed. Developers Diversified was the biggest loser, down 17.1 per cent to $1.94.There was no major spike in volatility, which analysts said would have to come before equity markets bottomed out. The Vix index, which measures volatility, fell 0.4 per cent."
326;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-02-17T23:43:55Z;Congo hints at shelving mine deal talks;;The protracted renegotiation of mining contracts signed in the Democratic Republic of Congo by Freeport McMoran and First Quantum could be formally put “on hold” if a deal is not reached soon, the head of Congo’s state-owned mining company has said.The groups are developing two of Congo’s biggest copper and cobalt projects. Of the 61 companies whose contracts the government said it wanted to renegotiate two years ago, they remain furthest away from concluding the process.Ahead of a new round of talks due to begin on Wednesday in the Congolese capital, Paul Fortin, head of Gécamines, the state-owned miner, told the Financial Times: “If there are one or two issues we can’t close then the option may be to leave things open, saying ‘We cannot agree. This matter will stay pending’.”Shelving the negotiations would leave Freeport McMoran, based in the US, and First Quantum, based in Canada, in an uncertain position but allow them to remain licensed and continue developing their mines.Mr Fortin said: “I’d say the chances are we’ll have an agreement this week. We’ve been talking long enough and we’re both fed up.”Gécamines acts as a joint venture partner for most foreign mining companies in Congo. The government initiated the review in 2007 to improve its earnings from the contracts, many of which were signed during Congo’s 1998-2003 civil war.Freeport and First Quantum have insisted on the validity of their current contracts and both declined to comment on the most recent talks. Their negotiating position has been strengthened by a downturn in commodity prices, which has strangled state revenues and made their two new projects more vital to the government.But if their renegotiations were put on hold, Mr Fortin said “it wouldn’t be to the advantage of the companies or their shareholders or their financiers and I don’t think they would want it hanging over their head”.The doubts created by the renegotiation process have made it difficult for some companies to finance their operations, while forcing others to cancel expansion plans. Mining analysts say that as a result, Congo was not able to profit as much as it might have done from the commodities boom.After an initial review of the contracts, the mining ministry said last year that 14 were acceptable, 26 required renegotiation on some points and 21 needed to be cancelled.Aside from Freeport and First Quantum, Mr Fortin said on Tuesday the only other outstanding contracts were with six to 10 other companies where “the lawyers just need to agree on the fine points”.Freeport has invested at least $1.75bn in Tenke Fungurume, its joint venture with Gécamines, which is due to come on stream in the second half of this year.First Quantum is developing the Kingamyambo Musonoi Tailings project.
327;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-02-17T21:41:00Z;Banks drive Wall St to new low for year;;Financial stocks were the hardest hit in a broad-based sell-off on Wall Street on Tuesday that pushed the market to its lowest level of the year.Big-name banks did particularly badly as the S&P 500 slumped beneath the psychologically significant 800 level for the first time since November, which prompted concerns among technical analysts that the benchmark index would test an 11-year low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, closed on Tuesday within a hairsbreadth of a fresh low for the financial crisis.JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America lost 12.3 per cent to $21.65, 13.1 per cent to $13.69 and 12 per cent to $4.90, respectively, as fears of outright nationalisation of a key institution persisted and investors continued to seek clarity over the Obama administration’s plans to shore up the sector.“All eyes are on Washington,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.Credit card stocks came under heavy selling pressure after American Express, down 11.3 per cent to $13.96, warned that credit card delinquencies rose last month.Meanwhile, Capital One also warned defaults on its US-issued cards rose last month, prompting fears that the bank’s dividend was at risk. The shares dropped 16.4 per cent to $10.13, which Friedman, Billings, Ramsey analyst Scott Valentin said was “driven by misplaced chatter over a debt covenant breach.”Regional banks did badly, down 8.7 per cent overall, while the financial sector shed 9.8 per cent.The consumer staples sector failed to find positive territory in spite of better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from Wal-Mart, which were helped by strong sales.The world’s largest retailer was one of only eight stocks in the S&P 500 to find positive territory, up 3.7 per cent to $48.24.Although the best performing of the main sectors, consumer staples nevertheless shed 1.8 per cent overall as all 10 industry groups finished sharply in the red.Meanwhile, investors remained concerned that Washington’s $787bn economic stimulus package – which President Obama signed into law on Tuesday– may not be enough to stave-off a deepening recession.“They don’t think the stimulus, the way it’s been presented, is going to do much to the economy in the short term,” Pran Tiku, president of Peak Financial Management, said of the market’s participants. “They have nothing to hang their hat on.”The S&P closed down 4.6 per cent at 789.17, less than 5 per cent away from an 11-year low hit last autumn. The index began the year more than 20 per cent above that nadir.The Dow finished down 3.8 per cent to 7,552.60 and the Nasdaq Composite Index down 4.2 per cent at 1,470.66. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a measure of anxiety known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, leapt 12.9 per cent to 48.5.Concerns over the Obama administration’s ability to support the banking sector had pushed financial shares lower in recent sessions.The industrial sector also came under heavy selling pressure after data from the New York Federal Reserve showed manufacturing production in the state fell to its lowest level of the recession so far.Also weighing on the market, General Motors and Chrysler were expected to make clear that they need more government support than the $17.4bn already approved. GM shares were off 12.8 per cent to $2.18 while Ford, which has not yet received any bail-out funds, fell 4 per cent to $1.69.Commodity stocks also did badly. Freeport-Mcmoran dropped 11.1 per cent to $27.12 while energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil, off 4.4 per cent to $71.28, did badly as oil prices fell sharply.However, Newmont Mining jumped 3.4 per cent to $12.49 as gold prices rallied.Elsewhere, Coca-Cola gave back 2.9 per cent to $42.60 following a reasonable performance last week on the back of well-received results. Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling, its second-biggest bottler, disclosed an unexpected fourth-quarter loss and warned it could not provide a forecast for the year.The US markets were closed in the previous session due to the President’s Day holiday.
328;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2009-01-12T22:35:41Z;US stocks lose ground ahead of earnings;;"US stocks were sold off sharply on Monday as investors braced themselves for what is set to be a bleak earnings season, which kicked off with results from Alcoa, the aluminium producer, after the closing bell.Shares in Alcoa, which dropped 10.7 per cent last week on its plans to cut 13,500 jobs and reduce production for the third time in as many months, shed a further 6.9 per cent to $10.06.“We see this action as ‘reactive’ in light of the prevailing market conditions,” said Deutsche Bank, which downgraded its view of the stock to “sell” ahead of the results. The analysts also highlighted Alcoa’s net debt of about $9bn.The shares were flat in after-hours trading, when the group disclosed a $1.49 a share loss, much wider than analyst forecasts.The wider market opened lower and the sell-off worsened during much of the session. The S&P 500 closed down 2.3 per cent at 870.26 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.5 per cent at 8,474.05 points and the Nasdaq Composite index 2.1 per cent at 1,538.79 points.Financials led the retreat, down 5.7 per cent on concerns over the need for more capital raising. The sharp sell-off took the S&P financials index 19.8 per cent below a high hit last month.Citigroup sank 17 per cent to $5.60 amid fears the bank would still need more capital even if it spins off its brokerage unit into a joint venture controlled by Morgan Stanley as planned.“While we believe this deal will provide some near-term capital relief, more likely will be needed,” wrote Meredith Whitney, analyst at Oppenheimer in a note to clients. Morgan Stanley rose 1.4 per cent to $18.79.Bank Of America, one of the worst performers on the Dow in the opening sessions of the year, was another big loser, down 12 per cent to $11.43 after Citigroup said “investors should be braced for a very challenging” fourth quarter.Keith Horowitz, analyst, cut his forecast to a loss of 75 cents a share and expected the bank to cut its dividend from 32 cents to
5 cents a share. Insurers were among the hardest hit as several stocks in the sector hit fresh lows.Investors are expecting downbeat figures from companies in the fourth-quarter earnings season, particularly after a glut of profit warnings in recent sessions.Last week, the market fell below the level at which it started the year after glum corporate outlooks from sector bellwethers such as Intel, Wal-Mart and Time Warner underscored the depth of the recession.A so-called Santa Claus rally at the end of the year had taken the benchmark S&P index up as much as 24 per cent from the 11-year low hit last November. But the sputtering performance of recent sessions has pared the gain to 15.7 per cent.Ashraf Laidi, strategist at CMC Markets, noted that t was the third time since the autumn that the market had failed to extend a bear market rally by more than 25 per cent. Andrew Garthwaite, strategist at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note to clients: “We cannot see a normal bull market until the structural issues of deleveraging are more complete.”Barry Knapp, of Barclays Capital, said: “We believe the [recent] rally in credit took the equity market along for the ride, and stocks have gotten ahead of themselves in the recovery process.”The wider materials sector was one of the worst performing, off 3.1 per cent as base metals fell back. US Steel and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold were particularly hard hit, down 12.9 per cent at $31.97 and 11.5 per cent at $25.44, respectively.The energy sector lagged behind the wider market as oil prices dropped back beneath $40 a barrel. That afforded the consumer discretionary sector scant comfort. Amid the losses, traditionally defensive stocks were the best performing as investor risk appetite ebbed away. Utilities was the only sector to find positive territory, up 0.2 per cent overall, while the consumer staples sector outperformed with a 0.5 per cent fall.Also hurting sentiment was the disclosure from Rick Wagoner, chief executive of General Motors, that the car group could in a worst case scenario seek more aid from Washington than the $13.4bn already allocated.Shares in GM rose 3 per cent to $4.15, however, as the group said it nevertheless had enough funds to last until March."

Nordstrom, another department store chain, bounced 6.5 per cent to $13.98 and the retail sector stood 1.8 per cent higher overall, helping pare the market’s losses.“It’s a good sign for the retailers, that’s for sure,” said John Brady, head of hedge fund sales at MF Global. He said the move could be a sign that banks were “being a little bit less restrictive”.The market overall failed to hold gains enjoyed in the previous session, when the Federal Reserve’s historic move to cut rates to virtually zero spurred a 5.1 per cent rally in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The S&P 500 closed down 1 per cent on Wednesday at 904.42 after drifting between positive and negative territory throughout the day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.1 per cent lower at 8,824.34 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.7 per cent weaker at 1,579.31.Trading was largely muted, however, as investors digested the effects of the Fed’s aggressive interest rate policy.Financials finished 1.3 per cent lower overall. Shares in Morgan Stanley lost as much as 8.3 per cent in the morning session as the bank reported a fourth-quarter loss that was wider than even the most bearish predictions. The figures prompted Moody’s to downgrade the bank’s senior debt rating.Yet the shares finished 2.3 per cent higher as traders were encouraged by the bank’s attempt to reduce its leveraged capital structure. Richard Bove, analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, lifted his price target on the stock to $18.Goldman Sachs, which jumped 14.4 per cent in the previous session following its fourth-quarter results, added a further 3.7 per cent to $78.78.However, regional banks, off 2.3 per cent overall, underperformed the wider financial sector after Fifth Third’s move to cut its fourth-quarter dividend to 1 cent a share sparked concerns others may be required to take similar action. Fifth Third fell 6 per cent to $7.51 while KeyCorp lost 4 per cent to $8.33.Among other consumer stocks, ConAgra and General Mills jumped 8 per cent to $16.25 and 0.2 per cent to $61.35, respectively, on the back of better-than-expected second-quarter profits.Newell Rubbermaid was the worst performing stock on the S&P 500, pushed 27.3 per cent lower to $9.58 by a profit warning that prompted analysts at BMO Capital Markets to question whether the company would retain its dividend.Investors did not appear reassured by plans from the maker of Sharpie pens, among other products, to cut up to 10 per cent of non-

Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold advanced 4.5 per cent to $26.01 as gold prices enjoyed strong gains.However, the energy sector came under selling pressure as US crude prices neared $40 in spite of Opec’s production cut.Elsewhere, Apple continued its bad run, down a further 6.6 per cent to $89.16, after the withdrawal of Steve Jobs, chief executive, from the group’s main event of the year prompted Oppenheimer to downgrade its view of the stock to “perform”.“It’s past time for Apple to either disclose the state of his health or elaborate a viable plan for eventually transferring power,” the analysts wrote, removing their price target. “Until such time, we can no longer continue to recommend Apple as a long-term investment.”Better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from Adobe afforded the technology sector scant comfort.Shares in the software group were dragged 2.8 per cent lower to $21.69 as the wider sector fell 1.7 per cent.Barclays noted the company did not give guidance for next year. “We believe the near-term environment will continue to pressure the top-line,” wrote the analysts, although they maintained their “overweight” stance."

He placed a “sell” rating on the stock.Other financials escaped the wider market gains. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley fell 2.8 per cent to $8.30 and 2.5 per cent to $14.60 ahead of results season.However, the wider market finished higher despite profit warnings and analyst downgrades across a wide range of other sectors, as well as fears political wrangling could delay a bail-out of the car industry.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 1.2 per cent at 899.24 after swings between positive and negative territory throughout the day.

Shares in the photography group lost 8.5 per cent to $6.59.Similarly, the technology sector held up even after Electronic Arts– off 12.1 per cent to $17 – cut its outlook, which prompted a host of analyst downgrades for the video games stock.Yahoo climbed 9.9 per cent to $13.40 after Ivory Investment Management, a shareholder, urged a tie-up with Microsoft, which edged 0.1 per cent higher at $20.61.Apple was an exception to the gains, off 1.9 per cent to $98.21, after Morgan Stanley cut its price target from $105 and $95.“We view [the] iPhone as most price-sensitive in a global recession and do not believe the combination of double-digit unit growth and [at least] 40 per cent gross margins are sustainable.”The energy sector, up 4.7 per cent, led the market’s advance as oil prices rebounded.Material stocks also performed well, up 2.7 per cent overall, as base metals staged a recovery. Mining stocks were in sharp focus after Rio Tinto’s restructuring to cut costs, and Alcoa and Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold gained 6.8 per cent to $10.20 and 16 per cent to $22.89, respectively.The telecoms sector was off 2.6 per cent overall amid concerns over the future of Nortel.Shares in the battered Canadian equipment maker shed a further 23.1 per cent to $0.40, although the group said it had no imminent plans for a bankruptcy
filing.AT&T lost 3.7 per cent to $28.08 even after FBR resumed coverage of the stock with an “outperform” rating. FBR said it was “insulated from macro pressures due to its diversified revenue mix”.Also weighing on sentiment, data from the Commerce Department showed wholesale inventories fell by 1.1 per cent in October, the most in seven years and worse than expected.Meanwhile, shares in General Motors and Fordenjoyed strong gains early in the session as negotiations between the Bush administration and Capitol Hill over a bail-out for the ailing car industry initially appeared to edge closer to a conclusion.However, the shares fell back to finish 2.1 per cent lower at $4.60 and 0.6 per cent higher at $3.25 after Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, called the planned bail-out “a travesty”."

They also said that, barring another slump in trading, the firm was not in immediate danger of breaching its banking covenants.A rally on Wall Street combined with expectations of a sharp Bank of England rate cut on Thursday pulled the wider market higher at the end of a volatile session.The FTSE 100 closed up 1.1 per cent, gaining 47.1 points to 4,169.96.Defensive pharmaceuticals companies were in favour, with GlaxoSmithKline closing up 4.4 per cent to £11.70 and AstraZeneca rising 5.4 per cent to £26.08.For the latter, a successful trial of PN400, a pain relief treatment, provided a small boost to sentiment.Man Group led the blue-chip risers, up 6.7 per cent to 256p, after reporting gains for its two flagship funds.Better-than-feared results from Sage Group sent the software maker rallying 6.3 per cent to 167.8p.

Xstrata lost 5 per cent to 690½p and Lonmin was down 2.2 per cent to 663½p.Rio Tinto slid 9.6 per cent to £11.48, even after reiterating that it had no current plans for a rights issue.Rio has dropped 54 per cent since BHP Billiton last week pulled its hostile bid, with investors focusing attention on its financing needs. The group has $38bn (£25.8bn) of debt, with $9bn due for repayment in October.Analysts argued that Rio looks to be adequately funded, providing metals prices do not lurch lower again. The group also has the option of cutting spending and selling assets.“However, many clients do not believe that muddling through is an option,” said Credit Suisse.It argued that a $7.5bn rights issue would be enough to cut Rio’s debt to manageable levels and alleviate investor fears about its balance sheet.Elsewhere on the downside, Stagecoach dived 16.5 per cent to 143.2p after warning over profits at its South West Trains rail arm.The alert unsettled the rest of the transport sector with Go-Ahead Group off 13.1 per cent to £10.18, FirstGroup dropping 8.2 per cent to 394¾p and National Express down 8.7 per cent to 499p.Publisher Reed Elsevier gained 3 per cent to 542½p amid fresh speculation that it could shelve the sale of its business information unit.Bain Capital, the private equity firm, was said to be looking at bidding as little as £600m for the unit, less than half its original valuation.Whether or not Reed gets the disposal away, the group still needs to refinance at least £2bn of debt by early 2010, Deutsche Bank argued, adding that one option for the media company’s management would be to suspend the dividend.Ashtead, the Anglo-US plant hire group, slid 9.8 per cent to 30p as brokers moved to cut forecasts ahead of its interim results due next Tuesday.“The equipment rentals sector in the US and UK appears to have hit the wall in the last month or so and, with high levels of operational and financial leverage, it is likely that Ashtead will be seeing declining utilisation rates,” said Cazenove.A day after Goldman Sachs took HMV off its sell list, HSBC removed the retailer off its buy list.HMV faded 11.9 per cent to 107½p as HSBC moved to “neutral” ahead of the group’s interim results next week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.1 per cent stronger at 8,591.69 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 2.9 per cent higher at 1,492.38.Speaking at a conference on Wednesday, Bill Miller, the celebrated Legg Mason stock picker, said: “It is hard to sustain panic for a really long period of time. It looks like the bottom has been made in US stocks.”Online retailers welcomed after figures from ComScore showed that e-commerce spending had jumped 15 per cent on Cyber Monday, the day after the Thanksgiving shopping weekend.Amazon.com advanced 9.8 per cent to $45.21, while the consumer discretionary sector was up 1.7 per cent overall despite the broader market decline.Yet the internet shopping and mortgage data were notable exceptions in a bleak raft of figures released on Wednesday, which indicated the year-long recession was deepening.Before the wave of buying into the close, a bleak assessment in the US economy from the Federal Reserve’s beige book had pushed the market down as much as 2.5 per cent.Commodity stocks, under pressure throughout the day, were the key laggards after the Fed acknowledged production and exploration cuts in mining and energy.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, down 17.3 per cent to $18.05, highlighted investor concerns over the materials sector when the group disclosed plans to suspend its annual $2-a-share dividend.Profit warnings pushed Schlumberger and Alpha Natural Resources down 3.2 per cent to $42.53 and 9.6 per cent to $17.13.Constellation Energy was a a notable exception to a weak energy sector, up 10.1 per cent to $27.70 after EDF, the French power group, unveiled a bid, to rival Warren Buffett’s offer, that would value the company at about $52 a share.Service industries contracted in November at the fastest pace on record, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses.Meanwhile, private companies cut 250,000 jobs last month, worse than expected and the most in seven years, according to a report by ADP Employer Services based on payroll data.The figures sparked fears that the closely watched non-farm payrolls data due for release on Friday could be worse than expected and led Goldman Sachs to downgrade its prediction to a loss of 400,000.Technology came under pressure from Research in Motion, which slashed its earnings outlook. Still, the volatile stock – a notable loser amid strong gains in the previous session – finished up 4.4 per cent higher at $38.96.Reassurance from Cisco – up 4.5 per cent to $16.01 – helped put a lid on losses in the technology sector. Investors took kindly to comments from John Chambers, chief executive of the networking equipment supplier, who said he was comfortable with long-term revenue forecasts in spite of concerns about deep recession.Defensive stocks such as Coca-Cola, up 5 per cent to $46.14, did particularly well and cash rich ExxonMobil finished up 1.7 per cent to $78.93 to outperform the energy sector.Speculation that Toshiba could make a bid for Sandisk pushed the stock up 25.1 per cent to $9.02.

ICE January Brent remained flat at $45.44 a barrel.Crude oil prices have sunk by more than $100 a barrel in under five months after reaching record levels above $147 in early July.Crude stocks at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI, jumped 2.4m barrels last week and have risen 44 per cent compared with the same period last year.US crude imports fell 1.46m barrels a day to 9.5m b/d last week while refinery utilisation dropped 1.9 percentage points to 84.3 per cent.“It looks like refiners are moving to rationalise output to the lower demand levels,” said Tim Evans, of Citigroup.Gasoline stocks dropped 1.6m barrels compared with the consensus forecast for a 0.9m barrels increase. Nymex January RBOB unleaded gasoline lost 0.8 cents to $1.0517 a gallon.Distillate stocks (including those of heating oil) fell 1.7m barrels compared with the consensus forecast for an increase of 300,000 barrels. Nymex February heating oil added 1.6 cents to $1.6210 a gallon.Total US product demand fell 6.2 per cent year-on-year but the decline appears to be easing as lower prices have led to marginal improvements in consumption.The options market continues to reflect a significant likelihood that oil prices could sink as low as $40 in the next two months.But traders noted potential signs of a market trough with some investors building “call” option positions that will be profitable if crude recoversAmong the base metals, lead was the worst performer, falling 10.5 per cent to $975 a tonne and dropping through the $1,000 a tonne level for the first time since June 2006, following news that Ivernia had been given permission to export lead concentrates from western Australia, following a ban on shipments since early last year.Meanwhile, aluminium lost 4.7 per cent to $1,620 a tonne while copper sank 3.9 per cent to $3,410 a tonne.Freeport McMoRan, the world’s second-largest copper producer, on Wednesday announced that production next year would be cut 5 per cent followed by an 11 per cent reduction in 2010, due to falling prices.Freeport also suspended its dividend payment and said 2009 capital expenditure would be chopped in half to $1.1bn from an earlier estimate of $2.3bn.“We are responding aggressively to the current market conditions, which have weakened dramatically in recent weeks,” said Richard Adkerson, Freeport’s chief executive, who also highlighted the “uncertain economic outlook” facing the metals sector.
335;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-11-21T17:50:43Z;More than 80,000 jobs cut in just five days;;"More than 80,000 job losses were announced around the world this week as the global recession tightened its grip in virtually every business sector.A Financial Times study of company announcements, press briefings and union statements over the past five working days reveals the spread and depth of the downturn.Jobs have haemorrhaged from businesses as diverse as a Chicago kosher hot dog factory, a German airline and car plants in Japan. Companies have been forced into savage cost cutting as the effects of the credit crunch have sapped confidence and sent order books and commodity prices plummeting.Almost 30,000 job losses have been announced by British companies alone in the past two weeks.Richard Adkerson chief executive of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer, which is cutting more than 600 jobs in the US, said: “We’re running our business on the basis of being prepared to live with low commodity prices for an extended period.”More than half the job losses this week, were announced by Citigroup, the US bank, which has increased the number of staff it is making redundant to 52,000.But even without Citigroup, businesses around the world announced job cuts at the rate of more than 5,500 a day. Economists expect worse to come as output falls in developed countries and growth continues to slow in emerging markets such as China and Russia.Carmakers and their suppliers, from component manufacturers to steel producers, have been particularly badly hit, prompting producers in the US to seek a government bail-out.Toyota, Japan’s biggest carmaker announced on Friday that it was cutting its domestic temporary workforce by 50 per cent, or 3,000 jobs. Mazda is not renewing contracts for 1,300 temporary staff while Isuzu, the Japanese truck manufacturer is scaling back production with the loss of 1,400 temporary and contract workers. Temporary and part-time workers account for about a third Japan’s workforce. Asian business centres are also starting to feel the backlash of big job cuts announced by international banks this year. HSBC was reported this week to be cutting 500 jobs, the bulk of them in Hong Kong. Morgan Stanley handed notices to about 100 of its 1,700 Hong Kong staff while Standard Chartered is eliminating 527 jobs at its main office in South Korea.European job losses are also mounting. On Thursday alone, AstraZeneca, the Anglo-Swedish drug manufacturer announced that it was cutting 1,400 jobs and closing plants in Spain, Sweden and Belgium; Rolls Royce, the UK jet engine manufacturers, planned to cut 2,000 jobs worldwide; Sandvik of Sweden, the world’s largest manufacturer, announced that it was axing 2,300 jobs; Voestalpine, Austria’s biggest steelmaker, said it would not be renewing contracts for 2,100 temporary staff and Peugeot Citroën, the French carmaker, said it was cutting 2,700 jobs.Air France-KLM also revealed that it was postponing taking delivery of new fuel-efficient aircraft with the group preferring to hold on to its cash. Global airline-passenger traffic, according to the International Air Transport Association, dropped in September in the first fall for five years.Air New Zealand announced plans to axe 200 jobs this week while Deutsche Lufthansa is cutting about 500 staff at its regional carrier CityLine.In the US, where the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits is highest for a quarter of century, jobs are being cut in almost every sector.In addition to the continuing flow of redundancies at financial services companies, job losses were announced this week at Pepsi Bottling Group (3,150 jobs to go of which 750 are in North America); Lam, the San Francisco chip equipment manufacturer (600); Pilgrim’s Pride, the largest US chicken producer (335); Boeing’s defence manufacturing plant at Wichita Kansas (800); International Game Technology, which manufactures computerised gaming machines (460); and Sara Lee which is closing a kosher hot dog and meat processing facility in Chicago (185).There are thousands of other jobs being cut at small businesses. According to figures from Automatic Data Processing the world’s largest payroll processing company, small businesses in the US employing 49 or fewer people lost 25,000 jobs in October."
336;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-10-30T23:34:28Z;Brutal reversal stuns mining groups;;Mining executives should be used to the cyclical nature of their business by now, but the brutality of the reversal in their fortunes over the past six months has left them in a state of shock.Back in May, mining shares were trading at all-time highs having ridden a five-year wave of rising commodities prices.Since then, mining companies have seen most of these gains erased and are being forced hastily to revise business plans, cut output and ditch ambitious new projects.What should have been a natural correction in commodities prices brought on by the US recession and a slowdown of growth in China has, since September, turned into a full-blown crash.The fall in the price of metals such as copper, platinum and aluminium has been exaggerated by the forced selling of hedge fund managers, liquidating positions in commodities to cover losses elsewhere.Since the market peak in May, shares in BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest mining company, have lost 59 per cent of their value, while shares in BHP takeover target Rio Tinto have lost 68 per cent.Companies carrying emerging market risk or questions over their ownership have done particularly badly.Shares in Kazakhmys have fallen 85 per cent since May, in part because of its exposure to copper prices but also because its assets are located in Kazakhstan.Xstrata, the Switzerland-based diversified mining group, has lost 78 per cent of its value thanks to rumours that its biggest shareholder, commodities trader Glencore, was in trouble and could be forced to sell its 34 per cent stake. Glencore insists it is sound financial shape.Even given the mini-rally of the past few days, values of mining companies are “absurd”, according to one fund manager.“We will eventually have some more rationality back in the market, but these conditions could persist for some time. Fear and panic are still prevalent.” With the harsh new reality in mind, mining companies are acting swiftly to preserve profit margins and shore up balance sheets.Nickel and zinc miners have been among the hardest hit by falling prices, and many have already closed high-cost operations. In copper, Kazakhmys said on Thursday it would suspend mining at its highest-cost operations, while in aluminium Chinalco of China is to cut output by 18 per cent.Even companies with lower-cost mines have unveiled changes in strategy and the axing of ambitious expansion plans.Rio Tinto and Anglo American have both said they will review plans to build new mines and decide which projects to put on hold. Tom Albanese, Rio chief executive, said this month that the group would review its large pipeline of expansion projects and potentially delay building new mines. “We do not want to bring in supply before the demand is there,” he said.The biggest mining companies are now prioritising expansion of existing mines over riskier forays into new territories. This means, for example, that the long-awaited development of large new copper mines in Democratic Republic of Congo and Mongolia will probably be put on hold.Companies also realise it is now cheaper to buy mines from distressed rivals rather than build them. UK-listed Peruvian silver miner Hochschild is one example. “We have to reduce capital expenditure so we can have more cash available for opportunities that may arise,” says Ignacio Rosado, Hochschild’s chief financial officer.BHP and Vale of Brazil are also expected to snap up cheap assets. Marius Kloppers, chief executive of BHP Billiton, says the slump in mining shares should allow companies with cash and manageable debt, such as his, to buy up good value projects. “If you have the balance sheet at times like this, no doubt there are going to be opportunities.”As for the targets, there are likely to be hundreds of junior mining companies running out of money in the next year. Among the bigger companies, analysts say it is only a matter of time before US copper miner Freeport is bought. US aluminium group Alcoa is also the subject of takeover speculation, although the group’s packaging business could deter some buyers.It is clear the mining sector will become more consolidated, as strong companies pounce on those weakened by the credit crunch. But deals will not be easy, as executives are nervous about making big decisions in such volatile times. Companies are also proving impossible to value and it could be tricky for buyers and sellers to agree on prices.The slashing of investment across the mining industry will have a dramatic effect on the supply of commodities over the next few years. Although 2009 is likely to bring depressed levels of demand, when economies around the world finally recover there could be shortages of metals. Mining executives, who tend to be optimists by nature, are already predicting a second boom in commodities prices starting in 2010.They argue, hopefully, that it could be even better than the past five years.

Energy and materials, down 10.4 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively, led the market slump.Down as much as 8.3 per cent at one point, the S&P 500 closed 6.1 per cent lower at 896.78, below the level reached earlier in the month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.7 per cent to 8,519.21 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index lost 4.8 per cent to 1,615.75.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index – known as Wall Street’s fear gauge – shot up 30.5 per cent to 69.32, which indicated signs of heightened stress. Andrew Wilkinson, market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said that traders had donned “tin helmets” as options for the index expired.AT&T and Boeing slid 7.6 per cent to $23.78 and 7.5 per cent to $42.91, respectively, after both were among several blue chip stocks to disclose worse-than-expected quarterly figures.Pharmaceuticals were hit after Merck also disclosed glum figures and downgraded its outlook. The Dow Component fell 6.5 per cent to $28.01 even after it unveiled plans to axe 12 per cent of its workforce, a move investors would normally welcome.Traditionally defensive stocks such as McDonald’s failed to escape the declines. Shares in the world’s largest restaurant group, which managed an increase in third-quarter profit, held on to gains for much of the day but closed down 1.7 per cent to $54.18. The consumer staples sector slid the least of all, but still finished 3.8 per cent lower.Energy was the biggest drag on the market, hurt by oil’s slide below $70 as well as negative earnings, and slumped 10.4 per cent overall. ConocoPhillips lost 9.1 per cent to $49.06 after the group disappointed with exploration and production forecasts as well as a reluctance to buy back its shares.Baker Hughes, down 22.1 per cent to $30.35, was one of the biggest drags on the S&P after the oilfield services group warned of a “less certain” outlook as energy prices continue to fall.“Markets are being dominated by the fears and nerves that have been dominating for the last few weeks,” said Ian Griffiths, dealer at CMC Markets. “Growth is the main fear as earnings season gets into full swing.”Materials were another big laggard, down 8.3 per cent overall, hurt by BHP Billiton’s production figures.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, whose disappointing figures helped push the market sharply lower in the previous session, tumbled another 17.8 per cent to $26.92.All 10 main economic sectors were firmly in the red, although some technology groups managed to find positive territory.Apple added 5.9 per cent to $96.87, after sales of the iPhone powered a surge in quarterly profit. Yahoo advanced 2.7 per cent to $12.39 on plans to cut at least 10 per cent of its staff after quarterly profit fell sharply.Broadcom jumped 6.5 per cent to $14.70 on the back of better-than-expected results from the mobile phone chipmaker. Texas Instruments, under pressure in the previous session, recovered as much as 2.6 per cent but closed down 3.4 per cent at $16.28.SanDisk sank 31.6 per cent to $10.09 after Samsung Electronics dropped its $5.9bn unsolicited bid for the memory card manufacturer.Amazon fell 0.5 per cent to $49.99, having lost as much as 4.6 per cent on concerns that results due after the bell would echo a glum update from Ebay.Financials held up relatively well for much of the session as money market rates for interbank lending eased further, but sold off sharply towards the close, down 7 per cent. Insurers sustained particularly heavy losses.Still, Wells Fargo lost 4.1 per cent to $31.30 after Wachovia posted a $23.9bn third-quarter loss, the biggest of any US lender during the credit crisis. Shares in the bank, being acquired by Wells Fargo, fell 6.2 per cent to $5.71.
338;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-10-21T20:59:11Z;Poor earnings reports unsettle Wall Street;;A glut of poor corporate earnings and warnings of reduced profitability next year overshadowed a further improvement in money markets and pushed US stocks lower.The S&P 500 closed down 3.1 per cent at 955.05 on what was nevertheless a relatively calm day following last week’s near-unprecedented volatility. The Nasdaq Composite Index was 4.1 per cent lower at 1,696.68, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.5 per cent at 9,033.66.Downbeat figures from corporations in the industrial and technology as well as financial sectors demonstrated the toll that the credit crisis had already taken on profitability. Still, traders were more concerned by the generally downbeat mood among companies for the coming year.The technology sector was the biggest drag on the market, down 5.6 per cent overall. Texas Instruments fell 6.3 per cent to $16.85 after it disclosed worse-than-expected results after the bell on Monday.Sun Microsystems and Logitech sustained some of the heaviest losses, down 17.5 per cent to $4.77 and 15 per cent to $15.53, respectively, after updates indicated a downbeat outlook.Apple and Yahoolost 7.1 per cent to $91.49 and 6.1 per cent to $12.07 ahead of results due after the bell.Oracle was one of the few bright spots on plans for an $8bn share buyback but later fell back to stand 2.6 per cent lower at $17.69.A drop in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold profit, which lost 10.8 per cent at $32.74, also put downward pressure on materials, which stood 5.7 lower overall. AK Steel retreated 7.6 per cent to $13.96 after the group said prices would be down about 10 per cent towards the end of the year.DuPont lost 8 per cent to $33.28 after the chemicals company cut its full-year forecast.Lockheed Martin fell 9.7 per cent to $84.19 after the defence group reduced its guidance for next year on concerns of reduced military spending by the new administration.Caterpillar fell 5 per cent to $38.87 after the manufacturer reiterated its 2008 forecast but predicted no rise in revenues next year.However, some in the market downplayed the significance of earnings and argued developments in credit markets would remain centre stage“Earnings are going to be some what meaningless [this quarter],” said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial, who added that some signs in the credit markets were relatively reassuring.The Federal Reserve yesterday launched a new facility to restore liquidity for money market mutual funds and rates for inter-bank lending eased further.The regional banking sector, which stood 0.7 per cent higher, overcame a slew of grim results and was lifted into positive territory by plans to join the government’s $250bn recapitalisation scheme.For example, Regions Financial gained 6.1 per cent to $11.29 even though its earnings from continuing operations fell 76 per cent in the third quarter missing analyst forecasts.On the downside, Western Union sank 17.8 per cent to $16.75 after the group warned undershot Wall Street expectations and warned it could no longer forecast long-term profits.American Express, after the closing bell on Monday, reported a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings that nonetheless beat analyst forecasts. The shares rallied 8.4 per cent to $26.39 yesterday.Also bucking the downward trend, Pfizer was flat at $17.34 after the drug group’s results beat Wall Street’s expectations. 3M rose 4.4 per cent to $60.04, also on the back of well received figures.Energy stocks were also hit as crude fell on fears of a global recession. The sector overall stood 4.3 per cent lower.Meanwhile, Standard & Poor’s cut the expected 2008 dividend payment for the S&P 500 from $28.85 to $28.05, the lowest growth rate since 2001.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s ”fear gauge”, rose 1.1 per cent. At 53.253, it continued to indicate heightened distress.The fresh market decline came as it emerged that investor confidence plummeted last month, according to State Street research.
339;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
340;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-10-21T04:33:38Z;Reasons to be cheerful in troubled times;;"These are serious times so let’s get down to business. Here are seven reasons to be bullish.• Oil prices have halved. People will now be able to pay back their subprime loans. Banks will have to start writing up the subprime debt that caused this whole mess.• Stock prices have dropped to 2002 levels. The big difference between now and 2002: China, one of our biggest customers, is three times the size.• People are comparing this time to the Great Depression. This could not be further from the truth. In the Great Depression, the government, in its infinite wisdom, raised taxes and increased interest rates. In other words, it continued to deflate the economy during the downturn. It took money out of the economy. Without money, people could not start businesses, banks failed, people lost jobs, people went hungry. Why did the government do this? It was afraid of putting too much stimulus in the system as people would then get into a speculative frenzy like 1929. This time the government is doing the opposite. Rather than deflating it is reflating and we’ll all have to worry about any speculative excesses that occur only after the economy is back on track.• It is estimated the government is not just putting $700bn into the system as per the bail-out package passed by Congress but $2,250bn once you add in the AIG bail-out, Bear Stearns and the commercial paper facility. Additionally, the government has already cut rates once and will probably do so again. This $2,250bn does not equal $2,250bn in benefits to the economy. It equals $10,000bn-$20,000bn. Every dollar that goes into the banking system will then get lent out to someone, who will then use that dollar to buy goods from someone, who will then use that dollar to hire people. It is estimated that there is a 10x multiplier for every dollar the government puts into the banking system. I am discounting that a little to be conservative. $20,000bn is so much stimulus that is coming into the economy I’m not even sure we can handle it without breaking into another pattern of hyper-speculation. But one thing is for sure, with so much stimulus it will be pretty much impossible to sink into a depression.• “Don’t Fight The Fed” is a saying that is used to justify buying the stock market once the Fed started stimulating. Well, why is the economic news still bad and stocks still tumbling? Any stimulus takes six to 18 months to have its effect on the economy. In January 2001 the Fed started decreasing rates and we probably did not have a full recovery until 2002 and people did not fully see it (as exemplified in good economic reports) until 2003. Whenever a recovery will occur, the market will anticipate it about three to six months in advance. The one thing that makes this situation different is the amount of stimulus being put into the system. Every central banker in the world wants the US stock market to go up. Don’t Fight The World Fed.• Do not underestimate the effect hedge fund liquidations are having. The world’s 100 top hedge funds, representing several trillion in equity buying when you take into account their leverage, are in some form of liquidation. These guys are crushing the market, leaving solid companies trading for one to three times earnings in some cases. Once banks open their lending coffers again, private equity firms will swoop for these companies, creating a private equity (and hence, stock market) boom.• There is $11,000bn in cash sitting in money market funds and T-bills. Throw in the extra $20,000bn that is going to stimulate the economy. This money needs to grow and in a zero interest rate environment there is only one place: the stock market. So there are plenty of ways to make money. Perhaps the way that offers the greatest margin of safety now is closed-end funds trading at discounts to their net asset value that hedge funds have been crushing in their liquidations. Alpine Total Dynamic Dividend Fund; Morgan Stanley EDD; Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund; Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund; BlackRock MuniYield Insured Investment Fund are examples.I also like the commodity related stocks that Tontine, one of the best hedge funds ever (until this year) has been selling: Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold; Cliffs Natural Resources; KBR Inc. All trade for two to three times cash flows, with solid balance sheets. KBR has $10 a share in cash, is about a $16 stock and will earn $1.6 a share next year. The goal, regardless of how you feel about government intervention, is to get some of those trillions of dollars in your pocket.This column appears on alternative Tuesdays."
341;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-10-15T19:16:38Z;Yes, minister: what’s wanted from new bank directors;;Dear Sir Worthy Rich-Already,I’m delighted to hear from Paul Myners that you’re willing to be put forward as one of our three directors at GovBank. The official job spec is on its way from the Treasury to your Hampshire address by “snail mail”. A copy of a recent utility bill and a bank statement with your response should speed up the paperwork. Unofficially, here’s what’s actually involved.1) Independence. We don’t need to know about links with other directors via clubs, charities and City livery companies. We take those as read. But it would be awkward if it emerged, say, that you played golf regularly with the outgoing chairman. Incidentally, if you can think of any other potential candidates (women, in particular – if it works for the Icelanders, it could work for us – but, please, no Scots for now), let us know.2) Strong commercial experience. “Commercial” is our way of not saying “banking and financial” – dirty words around here – but that’s what we mean. Metal-bashers generally haven’t had to pick out a bad credit risk at 20 paces. Mind you, most of the departing bank chairmen and chief executives hadn’t made an eyeball-to-eyeball lending decision in their lives either – which underlines our point.When I say “financial” experience, short-sellers, spread-betters and derivative-peddlers are disqualified. If you’ve been lurking in “shadow banking”, stay in the shadows. Experience on the audit committee or as finance director is ideal. But if you stashed your last six-figure bonus in a high-interest Icesave account, you may wish to reconsider your candidacy.3) Real value to the board. Here at the Treasury, we like to say we’re providing the common equity and the new directors are providing the sweat equity. You should expect any future bonus to be share-based, if you get one at all. That’s shares without dividends. Payment may come later, in kind (how does Lord Rich of Smug sound?)4) Arms-length ownership. Think of the arms as the limbs of a deft puppeteer. If the board starts toying with expansion into emerging markets, or aggressive lending to ne’er-do-wells, we know you’ll Do the Right Thing. With more than 40 per cent of the stock behind you, other directors will listen. The prime minister is urging a return to “responsible risk-taking”. If in doubt, go easy on the risk-taking part.5) Temporary presence. Say four or five years. It could take that long to sort out this mess.That’s it in a nutshell. Hard, thankless work, for a basic salary, with no obvious end in sight, under the control of an absent but all-powerful boss. Just like a real job.Undermining companiesJust as the first, delicate shoots of optimism were starting to emerge among investors, Rio Tinto has stamped on them. Yesterday, it predicted a short-term slowdown in the Chinese economy, triggering a sell-off in mining shares.Rio can hardly be accused of scaremongering: the wording of its statement was painstakingly moderate. The miner said it was still positive about the long-term prospects for commodities demand. Chinese metals consumption would bounce back in 2009. The review of its capital expenditure plans, announced yesterday, would not lead to the scrapping of major projects but the “phasing” of some new mines to match metals demand.But the fact Rio said anything negative – in contrast to its relentlessly upbeat forecasts of the past 12 months – was enough to alarm the market. Shares in Rio itself closed down 18 per cent.It is the biggest mining company so far to react to the credit crunch and the plunge in metals prices, but it is not the first. Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, has said it will suspend share buy-backs and shelve expansion projects to preserve cash, while US copper miner Freeport is reviewing its capital expenditure plans.BHP Billiton, whose hostile pursuit of rival Rio is about to enter its second year, was quick to point out yesterday it had no plans to scale back the construction of new mines and that its balance sheet was in better shape than Rio’s.Don’t assume, however, that BHP has gone off the deal. The tougher economic environment has only whetted its appetite further. BHP’s ability to wring savings from the two groups’ Australian iron ore operations – conservatively estimated at $3.7bn a year – is only becoming more important as commodity prices fall.And the market turmoil means BHP looks likely to clinch the deal without having to raise its bid, as Rio’s shares are trading at a large discount to its existing offer. Virtually the only stumbling block – though it could be a big one – is whether the European competition authorities will give the deal the thumbs-up, despite fierce opposition from the miners’ steel-making customers.Rio Tinto: rebecca.bream@ft.com
342;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-10-08T20:53:25Z;US stocks slide despite rate cuts;;Wall Street stocks on Wednesday extended their worst five-day run of losses since 1987 after the co-ordinated global interest rate cut failed to calm nerves during a highly volatile session.Initial euphoria over the move dissolved and the market subsequently swung between gains and losses throughout the day. Further developments underlined concerns that the financial crisis was already hurting US companies by damping global demand and denting their ability to raise funds.Insurance stocks were particularly hard hit after Metlife became the latest big American company to announce plans to raise capital in the midst of the credit freeze. Metlife shed 26.8 per cent at $27, while peers Allstate and XL Capital sank 21.2 per cent at $29.96 and 27.7 per cent at $8.68 respectively.Similarly, Bank of America shed another 7.7 per cent to $21.95 after the group priced 455m shares at $22 each.Meanwhile, Alcoa kicked off the earnings season in downbeat fashion by announcing, after the close of the previous session, a lower-than-expected profit that sent the shares down 12.7 per cent on Wednesday to $14.59. The aluminium group has suspended its share buy-back programme.In volatile trading, the S&P 500 was by up as much as 2.5 per cent and down by the same margin.Stock futures jumped immediately after global central banks announced the cuts. “At last, a co-ordinated show of force,” said Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics. “The move is to be applauded but there is more to come . ”Yet the S&P closed 1.1 per cent lower at 984.86, further below the psychologically significant level of 1,000 that was breached in the previous session for the first time in five years.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2 per cent at 9,256.11, having slid by 3.7 per cent in the last half hour of trading. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.8 per cent to 1,740.33.The decline came even after a slew of stocks hit new lows for the year. The overall material sector overcame Alcoa’s difficulties, up 2.6 per cent. Freeport-McMoRan Copper and US Steel gained 10.1 per cent at $42.60 and 4.1 per cent at $53.37, respectively.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, jumped another 7.3 per cent to 57.58, the highest level since the credit crisis began.The SEC confirmed that its short ban imposed last month would be lifted last night, as planned. The index compiled by Bloomberg of stocks placed on the list fell 2.4 per cent, taking the loss since the ban was introduced to more than a quarter.Some in the market have blamed the ban for exacerbating volatility. “A lot of these liquidity providers [such as hedge funds] have just walked away from these stocks,” said Peter Bottini of optionsXpress.Legg Mason fell 13 per cent on Wednesday to $25.25, after Moody’s cut the debt rating on the money manager. American Express was among the biggest winners earlier in the session after Sanford C. Bernstein initiated coverage on the stock with a “market perform’’ rating and said the credit card group stands to increase market share. It later reversed the gains to stand 4 per cent lower at $27.12.Morgan Stanley – which sank as much as 39.9 per cent in the previous session on speculation that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s planned $9bn investment might not materialise – rose 4.8 per cent to $16.80. Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi reiterated that the deal would go ahead.Bank of New York Mellon climbed 7.9 per cent to $24.45 after agreeing to buy JPMorgan Trust Bank in Japan.Elsewhere, a host of retailers disclosed poor September sales. Escaping the declines, defensive stock Wal-Mart eased 0.5 per cent to $54.55 after the discount retailer was one of the few to report a positive like-for-like performance.Office Depot was one of biggest drags on the S&P, sinking 18.8 per cent to $3.67 after Credit Suisse cut its “neutral” recommendation to “underperform”.In automotives, Ford and General Motors shed 8.9 per cent at $2.66 and 8.6 per cent at $6.91 respectively – even as oil slid – after Citigroup cut its recommendation on the duo from “hold” to “sell”.
343;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-09-30T09:47:22Z;US and Asia stocks plunge;;Asian equity markets tumbled in reaction to the US House of Representatives rejection of a Bush administration’s $700bn bail-out plan for the financial industry while earlier US stocks suffered their biggest fall since the Black Monday crash of 1987.Financial stocks plunged across the region, leading markets lower. Hong Kong shares dropped as much as 6.1 per cent, the Nikkei in Japan lost 5.0 per cent, and Taiwan, which had been closed on Monday, lost as much as 6.7 per cent. However losses narrowed as the day progressed and Hong Kong, for example, closed with a 0.8 per cent gain. In India, the Sensex was 2.4 per cent higher by mid afternoon in Mumbai at 12,891.82South Korea and Taiwan temporarily banned short selling and Hong Kong’s regulator reminded investors that it would punish aggressive shorting.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index had fallen 3.4 per cent to 107.57 by early evening in Tokyo, extending the drop of 4.9 per cent it made over the previous five days. September looks as thought it will be the regional benchmark’s worst month since for 18 years.“There’s a massive crisis of confidence,” said Khiem Do, head of multi-asset at Baring Asset Management in Hong Kong. “I’m buying today. I love to buy when there’s panic. It’s the time to get companies with good long-term prospects cheaply.” He said the MSCI Asia Pacific index was trading at a bargain valuation of around 10.5 times earnings.Asian investors took their cue from the US markets, where the S&P 500 fell 8.8 per cent, its worst day since falling 20.5 per cent on October 19, 1987. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 7 per cent, close to the 7.3 per cent it fell when markets reopened after the September 11 attacks on the US in 2001.Oil fell by more than 10 per cent overnight. Nymex light sweet crude was trading at $96.42 a barrel by late afternoon in Singapore.The yen rose as investors returned money to Japan which they had borrowed there cheaply to deposit in other countries such as Australia with much higher interest rates. It reached Y103.54 to the dollar before weakening by more than one per cent beyond Y104.80.The South Korean won, however, hit Won1,230 to the dollar, its weakest for nearly five and a half years before strengthening slightly to Won1,206.75.Banks fell across the Asia-Pacific region, and so did exporters as investors worried about the prospects for the US economy, their biggest market.Among Japan’s big banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial, which on Monday bought a 20 per cent stake in Morgan Stanley, fell as much as 7.0 per cent, although it closed 4.7 per cent lower at Y893. MUFG lost about $500m on the $9bn investment overnight as Wall Street punished financial stocks.Nomura Holdings, Japan’s largest broker, dropped 7.3 per cent to Y1,326 in Tokyo and HSBC, the company with the biggest weighting in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, Sumitomo Mitsui fell by 7.1 per cent to Y630,000 and Sumitomo Trust & Banking dropped 6.6 per cent to Y670.In India, ICICI Bank dropped 7.2 per cent at the open as rumours circulated about the bank’s financial position before quickly changing direction to rise as much as 8.4 per cent to Rs534.50 after the Reserve Bank of India guaranteed the bank’s deposits. ICICI’s managing director, K V Kamath, called the rumours “baseless and malicious”.Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, the world’s biggest bank by market value, lost as much as 8.7 per cent in Hong Kong but ended the day 1.6 per cent higher at HK$4.58 (ICBC was not traded in Shanghai as mainland markets are closed until Monday for the Golden Week of public holidays.)The region’s biggest market, Japan, fell to its worst closing levels since June 2005. The Nikkei 225 average ended 4.1 per cent lower at 11,259.86 and the broader Topix index ended 3.6 per cent lower at 1,087.41.Among leading electronics companies, Sony fell 7.1 per cent to Y3,150, Canon lost 6.1 per cent to Y3,820 and the games maker Nintendo was down 4.0 per cent to Y43,400.The Hang Seng index closed 0.8 per cent higher at 18,016.21 and the main sub-index of mainland companies listed in the territory was 1.3 per cent higher at 9,070.31The pain was spread across most of the territory’s listed companies. Bank Of East Asia fell by 2.0 per cent to HK$24.00 and China Merchants Bank fell by 2.8 per cent to HK$18.22. But Wing Lung Bank rose by 6.2 per cent to HK$155.10 as China Merchants completed its purchase of Wing Lung.The oil producer Cnooc fell by 1.7 per cent to HK$8.85 but mainland refiners rose as cheaper crude helps them to improve margins as Beijing controls the price of petrol and other refined products.

345;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-09-08T01:51:38Z;Congo prepares to sell off mining assets;;The government of Democratic Republic of Congo is planning to privatise some of its most valuable mining assets, as well as take a larger share of any future discoveries made in the mineral-rich country.Victor Kasongo, Congo’s deputy minister of mines, said on Friday that “a major future initiative” for the government was the transformation of state-owned mining companies into commercial entities. He said new management would be drafted in to turn round ailing businesses and then they could be floated through an initial public offering or stakes could be sold to private mining groups.The first mining flotation should happen “in less than 12 months”, said Mr Kasongo. “Gecamines [the state copper company] is a very interesting asset. And Okimo [the state gold company] has a lot of good reserves, it could be a good company for an IPO.”The news comes as the government continues its review of the country’s mining contracts, many of which were signed when Congo was embroiled in a bloody civil war.Mr Kasongo said that of the 61 mining companies involved in the review, the government was satisfied that 14 were developing their projects in a way that was fair and transparent. But 25 companies would have their contracts modified and a further 22 companies “have contracts so far out of line with mainstream international practice as to warrant cancellation”. These groups would have to renegotiate their contacts completely.Companies including Freeport McMoRan, Lundin Mining, Anvil Mining, Katanga Mining and First Quantum Minerals are involved in the long-running talks with the government. The uncertainty over their contracts has depressed their share prices, while several other large mining companies are waiting until the review is completed before investing in the country.Mr Kasongo declined to say which companies had not satisfied government requirements and risked having their mining licences revoked. “We want to leave the negotiations some room.”The government also revealed that it would take control of any future mineral discoveries made in the country by private companies. It said state-owned companies such as Gecamines and Okimo would automatically own 51 per cent of any mining project, which it claimed was “based on the standard international practice of countries such as South Africa and Zambia”.www.ft.com/commoditiesboom
346;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-09-02T20:51:52Z;Energy stocks drag Wall Street down;;"Energy stocks dragged Wall Street into the red on Tuesday as tumbling oil prices greeted investors returning from their Labor Day holiday. Crude oil fell as much as $8 a barrel before paring early losses.ExxonMobil dropped 3.4 per cent to $77.32 while ConocoPhillips dipped 4.3 per cent to $79. and refiner Tesoro slid 6.9 per cent to $17.28. Coal companies were particularly hard hit. Massey Energy dropped 10 per cent to $59.35, Arch Coal slid 14.8 per cent to $46.19 and Consol Energy lost 8.55 per cent to $61.92. So far this quarter, energy has been the worst performing sector, down 18.7 per cent. The materials sector, down 9.2 per cent over the period, shed another 2.5 per cent on Tuesday.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dipped 7 per cent to $83.05, Monsanto fell 4.3 per cent to $109.34 and US Steel lost 10.3 per cent to $119.39.Airline, automaker and consumer discretionary stocks helped the S&P 500 briefly break through the psychologically important 1,300 mark.However, the broader market gave up early gains. By the close however, the broader index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,277.55.Richard Parker, managing director of institutional equity trading at Stanford Financial said the morning rally “didn’t have an a awful lot of legs to it”.Analysts at JPMorgan’s Private Bank said: “Investors return from their summer holidays facing the same uncertainties as when they left . . . [Still] the current investor caution makes us think that equity prices may already be discounting many of the risks we’ve been concerned about.”Financials lost steam as the day progressed, although most banks held on to some modest gains. Bank of America climbed 3.4 per cent to $32.20 after Goldman Sachs recommended buying the shares on the basis of “long-term earnings power” and near-term capital options which could help it avoid issuing common equity.Lehman Brothers, the embattled investment bank, briefly advanced after reports that Korea Development Bank was in talks to buy a stake in the securities firm. At the close, Lehman shares were up 0.3 per cent to $16.13.Citigroup added 0.6 per cent to $19.11 while JPMorgan rose 1.3 per cent to $38.99 and the S&P 500 financials sector rose 1.8 per cent.Regions Financial also made progress, jumping 19.2 per cent to $11.05. The Alabama-based bank said it had assumed about $900m in total deposits from Integrity Bank, a failed bank.Meanwhile, the weaker-than-expected impact of Hurricane Gustav gave other energy-sensitive stocks a boost. Airline companies UAL, Delta and AMR soared 11.7 per cent to $12.41, 12.8 per cent to $9.17 and 11.3 per cent to $11.50.Automakers General Motors and Ford added 6.5 per cent to $10.65 and 1.12 per cent to $4.51.The broader consumer discretionary sector also made strong gains, led by consumer services and retail stocks as investors bet that falling oil prices would boost spending power.Carnival, the cruise operator, rose 5.6 per cent to $39.13, while Lowe’s added 6.9 per cent to $26.33. The sector as a whole rose 1.8 per cent.That, early positive momentum helped markets to glide past some weak macroeconomic data released in the mid-morning, showing a stagnant manufacturing sector and a further decline in construction spending.Since its low point on July 15, the benchmark S&P 500 index has bounced about
5.2 per cent, partly because of a 24.3 per cent drop in the price of oil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 2.1 per cent in early trading before giving up those gains to close at 11,516.92, down 0.2 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,349.24.In technology, Xerox climbed 3.1 per cent to $14.36 after Citi initiated coverage with a “buy” recommendation and a $20 price target.The office equipment maker had “perhaps the most compelling enterprise services portfolio of any company in the market”, Citi said.News that Google released its own internet browser initially helped the stock advance. But the moves were not enough to keep the sector in the black and it swung to losses of 1.4 per cent. Google shares slipped 0.4 per cent to $465.25."
347;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-08-31T22:35:33Z;Atticus principals to be hit where it hurts most;;"For most of the past decade, Atticus Capital has been a force to reckon with in global markets. From its base in New York, the hedge fund, which had more than $20bn of assets under management at its peak last year, helped dictate the course of mega-mergers and corporate strategy at some of the world’s biggest companies – and made a fortune in the process.Founded by Tim Barakett, a Canadian, in 1995, the young manager soon hired Nathaniel Rothschild, son of Lord Jacob Rothschild, to act as co-chairman and draw on his connections to raise money. He subsequently poached David Slager, a British-educated Dutch trader, from Goldman Sachs, who launched a European fund that grew rapidly to pass the original Global fund Mr Barakett runs.All three of them went on to make personal fortunes in the bull market, which ended in summer last year. Mr Barakett and Mr Slager were estimated by Trader Monthly magazine to have made $250m-$300m each last year, with Mr Rothschild adding to his family’s wealth with a similar income. The three of them, together with other staff, have more than $1.4bn invested in the $14bn fund, with Mr Barakett and Mr Slager having the vast bulk of their personal wealth tied up in Atticus.When the credit crunch hit in August last year, Atticus was caught out. The firm had a $1bn position in Britain’s Barclays Bank, where it was publicly opposing efforts by John Varley, chief executive, to buy Dutch rival ABN Amro – a deal that Barclays lost to Royal Bank of Scotland – as well as major unhedged holdings across many large companies. Mr Slager’s fund plunged more than 10 per cent in the month, its worst result yet, as banking shares, and Barclays, tumbled. Still, investors were unconcerned. The funds made back all their losses over the next two months, and the European fund ended 2007 up 28 per cent after fees – not a patch on the 44 per cent and 63 per cent gains of the previous two years, but still a phenomenal result for such a large fund.This year, investors have been more worried. The fund’s low levels of short-selling, which can hedge against falling markets, and its enormous position in Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, the stock exchanges, has hammered its results. Mr Slager has recorded his seven worst months since the credit crisis hit, and at the end of August was down 32.9 per cent this year. Mr Barakett has fared slightly better, but was still down 25 per cent.Now the fund and its top executives are braced for at least a year without bonuses, as Atticus will receive no performance fees – the bulk of its income – until the funds have made back their losses – requiring gains of 50 per cent for Mr Slager and 33 per cent for Mr Barakett.“Perhaps one concludes that the time is over for them,” said one investor. However, other investors said the dire results over the past 12 months were just a “natural” give-back of some earlier profits. Clients who put money with Mr Slager when his fund launched in 2001, for example, have still made more than three and a half times their money, turning $10m at launch into almost $37m.Nicola Horlick, in the latest report to shareholders in Bramdean, the London-listed investment fund she runs, said its holding in Atticus European was expected to be volatile, and was kept small as a result. “Given that the manager maintains concentrated positions, the heavy losses in declining markets are not surprising,” she wrote.Still, this year’s losses have been galling for Atticus, which believes it has picked strong companies in sectors which are fundamentally sound.“We continue to be disappointed by what we believe is an over-reaction in specific themes to concerns about growth,” it said in a report to Atticus European investors last month.“These valuations indicate persistent fear, and reflect the willingness of many investors to de-risk their portfolios uneconomically,” it wrote. “Historically, these conditions have indicated the wrong time to sell equities, and we believe that remains true today.”The latest regulatory filings show Atticus running with three big investment themes at the end of June: mining and oil/energy, including a $1bn holding in ConocoPhillips; financials and stock exchanges, including more than €1bn ($1.47bn) of Deutsche Börse, and a combined $1bn in Visa and Mastercard; and US rail, with $1bn of Union Pacific and another $1bn in Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Norfolk Southern. The hedge fund focuses on large companies, unlike many rivals, taking very large, concentrated positions. It originally started out following the “event-driven” strategy: buying cheap stocks where a corporate event could provide a catalyst for a jump in the price.As it grew bigger and more powerful it began to provide the catalyst itself, pushing management to take action it believed would boost the stock. In the case of Phelps Dodge, the miner, it even hired its own investment bankers to find a buyer, ahead of its sale last year to Freeport-McMoRan. It halved its $1.1bn equity stake in the second quarter, although it also bought $200m worth of options.Atticus has come under scrutiny for its links to The Children’s Investment Fund, an aggressive London activist hedge fund run by Chris Hohn, a Harvard friend of Mr Barakett.The two have frequently bought the same stocks or taken the same general views – including their focus on US rail – and are the two largest shareholders in Deutsche Börse.They worked together to prevent the exchange’s purchase of the London Stock Exchange, although subsequently they have diverged in views, particularly with regard to ABN, where Mr Hohn was pushing the Dutch bank to sell, while Atticus was trying to stop Barclays from buying.Concerns that they could be seen as acting together, highlighted by an inconclusive investigation by the German regulator, were behind Mr Hohn’s resignation last year as a director of RIT Capital, the listed Rothschild investment trust, where Mr Rothschild is also a director. RIT is an investor in Atticus, and the hedge fund rents its London office from RIT."
348;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-08-15T20:50:21Z;Retailer strength helps lift Wall Street;;"US stocks climbed modestly on Friday in a quiet session of trading, and made slight gains for the week, as oil prices dropped back and investors digested some positive results from retailers.Kohl’s kicked off the day in positive fashion, reporting second-quarter profit that fell less than expected. The company also forecast full-year profit ahead of previous expectations and the shares rose 7.1 per cent to $51.70.JC Penney also cheered investors with a smaller- than-expected decline in
second-quarter profit. JC Penney shares rose 8.4 per cent to $39.94.Meanwhile, Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen-focused clothing retailer, and Nordstrom, the department store chain, posted less impressive results but investors were resilient. Abercrombie held steady at $52.59 while Nordstrom rose 4.4 per cent to $31.54.The consumer discretionary sector added 1 per cent. Retailers have outperformed this earnings season, with S&P 500 constituents posting profit declines of about 5 per cent on average. That compares with an average drop of 23 per cent for S&P 500 companies.The leading equity indices received a boost from a sharp fall in commodity prices. Oil fell as much as $3 while gold dropped well below $800.Bijal Shah, global chief economist at Société Générale, said: “US consumer firepower, which had been decimated by the sharp rise in energy prices into the summer months . . . is likely to recover over the coming months.”In consumer staples, Wal-Mart Stores added 2.2 per cent to $59.37 and Procter & Gambleclimbed 2.7 per cent to $71.60, helping the sector to advance 1 per cent.Reports showing a small uptick in consumer confidence and a bump in manufacturing activity in New York state in August also lifted sentiment.General Electric shares rose 1 per cent to $29.80 while Manitowoc added 4.5 per cent to $24.96 and Paccar climbed 4.8 per cent to $44.81.Eight of the 10 leading industry groups gained ground, helping the benchmark S&P 500 advance 0.4 per cent to 1,298.2.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 11,659.9 and the Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.1 per cent to 2,452.52.Over another volatile week in which oil prices ticked higher before resuming their retreat, the S&P 500 fought its way to a 0.1 per cent gain – its third in a row. The Dow fell 0.7 per cent while the Nasdaq added 1.4 per cent.Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performers this week, adding 2.4 per cent, thanks to some solid earnings reports from the likes of Estée Lauder.Financials were the biggest losers after another round of writedowns and analyst downgrades and further developments in the auction rate securities fiasco.Goldman Sachs fell 7.5 per cent to $163.18 over the week while JPMorgan lost 8.2 per cent to $38.07 and Bank of America slid 5.6 per cent to $30.70.On Friday, banks fared better after S&P affirmed the credit ratings of the two largest bond insurers. MBIA and Ambac added 8.7 per cent to $11.22 and 24.6 per cent to $5.68, respectively, while the sector added 1.1 per cent.Jim Smigiel, head of investment strategy at SEI, said: “The Ambacs and MBIAs of the world are going to survive - that is how low the bar is at this point. Valuations are such that you don’t have to paint the rosiest picture to make gains in this market.”The pullback in commodities was less kind to energy and materials stocks.On Friday, Newmont Mining slid 3.2 per cent to $41.51, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 2.8 per cent to $84.39 while US Steel fell 3 per cent to $130.88.The energy sector fell back 1.8 per cent and has now lost ground in seven of the past eight sessions. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips gave up 0.5 per cent to $77.07 and 2.2 per cent to $77.66, respectively."
349;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-08-13T20:46:36Z;Financials lead Wall Street down;;Financial stocks led US equity markets down for a second session on Wednesday while some mixed results and an uptick in the oil price also weighed on investor sentiment.In the financial sector, another round of analyst downgrades took their toll. Citigroup cut its full-year 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates for JPMorgan, among others, while Merrill Lynch downgraded the shares of Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.JPMorgan shares fell 2.7 per cent to $36.91, Lehman dropped 4 per cent to $15.57, while Goldman gave up 1.4 per cent to $164.90 and Morgan dropped 5.5 per cent to $40.15.On Wednesday, the financial sector slid 3 per cent with Bank of America and Citigroup coming under selling pressure. The pair lost 7.2 per cent to $28.86 and 3.9 per cent to $17.81 respectively.“We continue to believe that investors are significantly underestimating both the scope and the extent of the credit bubble and the consequences of its subsequent deflation,” said Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch.“The problems in the financial sector appear to us to be far from over, and we are sceptical that trying to bottom-fish will prove to be profitable.”Observers suggested that the sector might remain under pressure in the short term after the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed a rule limiting certain types of short-selling in a handful of stocks to expire on Tuesday.In earnings news, Deere, the maker of farm equipment, said third-quarter profits rose 7.1 per cent to $575.2m thanks to strong demand for tractors and combines.But the results missed analysts estimates and the shares fell 3.2 per cent to $67.10. The news dragged on peers. Caterpillar dipped 2.8 per cent to $69.83, Boeing fell 2.5 per cent to $64.26 and the industrial sector as a whole declined 0.8 per cent.There was better news from the technology sector.Applied Materials, the maker of semiconductor machinery, projected that orders would increase between 5-10 per cent in the fourth quarter. That was better than expected and the shares rose 4.7 per cent to $19.33.Meanwhile, Nvidia, the maker of computer graphics chips, jumped 10.7 per cent to $12.26 after the company said it would buy back an additional $1bn of shares, bringing the projected total repurchase to about 44 per cent of all outstanding shares.Equity markets pared early losses but by the close, seven of the 10 leading industry groups were still in the red, knocking the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent to 1,285.83. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.9 per cent to 11,532.96, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.1 per cent to 2,428.62.Consumer-facing stocks were in focus as oil prices ticked more than $3 a barrel higher, a number of retailers reported disappointing results and new data showed weak retail sales in July.Liz Claiborne, the women’s apparel retailer, was among the biggest fallers after it reported a substantial second-quarter loss and lowered its full year forecast. The shares slid 11.6 per cent to $13.18.Retailers and the broader consumer discretionary sector also took some direction from a Commerce Department report on July retail sales. The survey showed that sales fell 0.1 per cent last month. That is the first headline dip in five months and will be seen as evidence that the impact of the stimulus cheques is waning.McDonald’s fell 1.8 per cent to $62.78 and Wal-Mart Stores lost 1.9 per cent to $57.88 while the consumer discretionary and staples sectors gave up 1.6 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively.Energy and material stocks were among the few consistent gainers throughout the day. Energy added 3.4 per cent, snapping a four-day losing streak, and materials climbed 2.4 per cent as heavily sold coal and metals stocks rebounded.Peabody Energy and Massey Energy rose 8.3 per cent to $58.85 and 7.8 per cent to $61 respectively while US Steel and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 6.2 per cent to $137.92 and 5.8 per cent to $88.50 respectively.Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S&P Equity Research, upgraded the energy sector to “overweight” arguing that “from a technical perspective, S&P believes the correction in oil prices from the recent high of $147 to below $115 is largely over.”
350;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-08-11T20:41:12Z;US stocks up as investors cheer drop in oil;;The S&P 500 index broke through the 1,300-point barrier on Monday for the first time since late June as investors cheered another drop in the oil price and some analyst upgrades in an otherwise unremarkable trading session.The telecoms and consumer discretionary stocks were among the biggest gainers, advancing 2.7 per cent and 4.4 per cent.Qwest Communications International rose 5.3 per cent to $4.01 after Citigroup recommended that investors buy the shares, arguing the company “remains ripe for both an operational and financial restructuring to improve returns to shareholders.”Verizon added 2.1 per cent to $35.30 while AT&T rose 2.8 per cent to $31.84.Another Citigroup note, this time on Amazon, also struck home with investors. Mark Mahaney, a Citigroup analyst, reiterated his “buy” call on the online retailer, pointing to stronger-than- expected sales of the Kindle, Amazon’s electronic book reader. “Turns out the Kindle is becoming the iPod of the book world,” Mr Mahaney said. Amazon rose 9.4 per cent to $88.09.Sentiment was positive throughout the retail sector as oil wallowed below $114 a barrel for much of the session. Gap, Dillard’s and Kohl’s climbed 8.8 per cent to $19.68, 6.9 per cent to $11.60 and 8.8 per cent to $51.01 respectively.The information technology, consumer staples and healthcare sectors also advanced, reinforcing their strong comeback as investors have moved away from energy stocks and into more defensive areas. Over the past six months the three sectors are the only ones to have made ground, adding 6.6 per cent, 4.6 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively.Brian Belski, US sector strategist at Merrill Lynch, said the sectors “offer US investors the most stable growth properties at current levels and going forward in terms of earnings and sales growth, margin expansion and cash flow”.On Monday, financials stocks were another standout, climbing 1.9 per cent as investors bought into heavily sold stocks and stalwarts alike. Washington Mutual added 3.5 per cent to $4.74, Wells Fargo climbed 4.8 per cent to $31.61 and American Express rose 3.6 per cent to $39.17.The benchmark S&P 500 gave up early gains of as much as 1.3 per cent but still closed 0.7 per cent ahead at 1,305.3. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 11,781.78 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.1 per cent to 2,439.95.Those gains followed a strong showing last week, when the S&P 500 advanced 2.9 per cent, buoyed by some decent results, a sharp drop in the oil price and the Fed’s decision to keep interest rates on hold.Still, analysts believe the major indices could move higher. Claire Collingwood, a dealer at CMC Markets, said: “Oil prices continue to be the main driving force behind the markets . . . as commodity prices continue to weaken then we can expect this to lead to a degree of movement back into equity markets.”With earnings season winding down, S&P 500 companies have posted second-quarter profit declines of about 23 per cent on average. Excluding financials, average earnings grew about 4 per cent.The energy sector lost 0.4 per cent after oil prices hit their lowest level since May. But coal stocks retreated. Massey Energy fell 5 per cent to $56.07, Consol Energy lost 4.4 per cent to $60.19 and Peabody Energy slid 5.8 per cent to $55.19.Among materials groups, a dip in industrial and precious metal prices shaved 0.4 per cent off the sector, making it the second worst performer of the day.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 3.8 per cent to $82.30, US Steel fell 6.7 per cent to $128.46 and Titanium Metals gave up 3.5 per cent to $10.63.Some deal news had a mixed impact. Waste Management, the rubbish hauler, raised its bid for Republic Services, a rival, by about 10 per cent to $6.73bn. In July, Republic rejected a $6.2bn offer from Waste Management. Waste Management shares rose 0.3 per cent to $36.10 while Republic shares rose 0.6 per cent to $35.05.United Parcel Service was in focus after the UK’s Sunday Telegraph said the parcel delivery company had held talks to buy TNT for €10bn ($14.9bn). UPS dismissed the report, but it slid 0.3 per cent to $65.51.
351;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-08-06T20:38:46Z;Gains in energy and materials lift Wall Street;;US stocks climbed modestly on Wednesday for a second straight session as energy and materials stocks made ground and investors cheered some decent results from technology bellwether Cisco.A small pull back in oil prices and a drop in gasoline inventories helped refiners to advance, taking energy stocks to a 1.9 per cent gain.Sunoco, Tesoro and Valero added 3.3 per cent to $43.28, 12 per cent to $17.39 and 7.3 per cent to $34.47 respectively.Materials stocks were the day’s second biggest gainers, climbing 1.6 per cent on some analyst upgrades and a bump in certain commodity prices.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold was the outstanding performer, adding 11 per cent to $87.67.Citigroup analyst John Hill advised clients to buy the shares, noting that they had dropped more than 35 per cent since mid-June while the company still had exposure to China, high margins and strong free cash flow.Technology was another positive. Cisco climbed 5.7 per cent to $23.93 after posting estimate-beating fourth quarter profits.Microsoft also received a boost after an analyst at UBS said the company could buy up to $20bn of stock back over the next three months. The shares rose 3.1 per cent to $27.02 while the broader sector added 1.3 per cent.The benchmark S&P 500 index shrugged off early losses to close 0.3 per cent higher at 1,289.07 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 11,656.07. The Nasdaq Composite ended the day 1.2 per cent ahead at 2,378.37.On Tuesday stocks rose the most in four months after oil prices dropped sharply and the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate at 2 per cent. An accompanying statement seemed to reduce the likelihood of rate rises, soothing investors concerns.In the telecoms sector, disappointing earnings news dragged the sector down 1.4 per cent on Wednesday.Sprint Nextel posted a $344m second quarter loss due to spending on discounts and advertising to win new customers. Sales fell 11 per cent to $9.06bn and the shares dived 14.2 per cent to $7.34. Qwest Communications International said profit dropped 24 per cent to $188m and cut its annual forecast. The results were in line with estimates but the shares slipped 6 per cent to $3.45.So far this earnings season more than 400 of the S&P 500 companies have reported results and on average, index members have seen an 18 per cent drop in profits.Financials have had another torrid quarter. Melissa Roberts, an analyst at KBW, said: “Results continued to be disappointing across capitalisation levels [revealing] continued asset quality deterioration, revenue growth offset by mounting expense growth, and reduced profitability.”KBW cut its earnings estimates for 2008 and 2009 by 14 per cent and 10 per cent respectively as a result.On Wednesday, there was mixed news from the embattled sector. Freddie Mac shares plunged 19.3 per cent to $6.49 after the mortgage finance company posted its fourth loss in a row and said it would cut its dividend.Fannie Mae, another government-sponsored entity, slumped 14.7 per cent to $11.60 on the news. Fannie reports results on Friday. Elsewhere in the financials sector the news was mixed but the sector was among the biggest losers of the morning session, dropping 0.7 per cent.Marsh & McLennan, said second-quarter profit fell 63 per cent to $65m owing to higher staff costs and certain writedowns at its corporate security division. The insurance broker still beat analysts’ estimates and the shares rose 2.5 per cent to $30.07. Nasdaq OMX Group jumped 16.9 per cent to $30.89 after the exchange operator posted results that beat analysts’ quarterly estimates.In the consumer staples sector, a drop in agricultural commodity prices helped offset a handful of disappointing results.Whole Foods, the grocer, tumbled 12.6 per cent to $20.04 after it posted annual earnings that undershot analyst’s estimates.Dean Foods dropped 5.7 per cent to $22.02 after the maker of dairy products forecast lower third-quarter profits than expected. As a whole, the consumer staples sector rose 1.1 per cent.Profit-taking and some poor results took their toll on the consumer-discretionary sector however. It lost 0.5 per cent led down by a 7.2 per cent fall to $22.45 for restaurant chain operator Wendy’s International.
352;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-08-04T21:45:28Z;Drop in oil hurts energy sector on Wall St;;"Wall Street stocks fell for a third session on Monday as a sharp drop in oil prices helped consumer-facing stocks but hurt commodity-related sectors.Energy and material stocks were the worst performers, hit by the pull-back in oil and other commodity prices. ExxonMobil, the oil producer, dropped 3.9 per cent to $76.60 and Schlumberger, the oil services company, dipped 5.8 per cent to $94.41. The sector gave up 4.9 per cent and has now lost more than 20 per cent from its recent highs.In materials, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold fell 12 per cent to $80.35 and AK Steel lost 8.4 per cent to $55. As a whole, the sector shed 4.2 per cent.The ructions in commodity markets overshadowed some significant economic data. The core personal consumption expenditures index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs and is the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, rose more than expected.As a result, although headline spending increased at a faster rate than expected, after adjusting for inflation, real consumer spending fell 0.2 per cent following a 0.3 per cent gain in May.Analysts at Lehman Brothers said: “On balance, this was a negative report showing a slowdown in spending and acceleration in inflation. We expect consumption will continue to weaken, especially as the rebate effect fades.”The data on personal consumption expenditures are of particular significance as they measure spending for all goods and services, which make up about 70 per cent of gross domestic product.Consumer-facing stocks slipped in early trade but recovered after oil dipped briefly below $120 a barrel. Wal-Mart Stores rose 1.2 per cent to $58.43, Procter & Gamble added 1.3 per cent to $65.82. Sears Holdings climbed 5 per cent to $82.78.Consumer discretionary and staples stocks overturned early losses to gain 0.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively.Bill Knapp, chief investment strategist at MainStay Investments, said: “Many of the agricultural commodities came down 5 per cent or more, copper dropped 4 per cent, so that big downdraft in commodity prices helped buoy equities after a relatively large decline early in the day.”The benchmark S&P 500 pared early losses but still closed 0.9 per cent lower at 1,249.02 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 11,284.15. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,285.15.Last week, markets had little to show for a volatile period of trading in which losses at the start and end of the week cancelled out gains in the middle. Equity markets took their cue from mixed second-quarter earnings, a decline in the price of oil and some weak economic data on growth, home prices and employment.On Monday, healthcare was the best performer, boosted by better-than-expected
second-quarter results and an improved forecast from Humana, the health insurer. Its shares added 4.9 per cent to $46.81 while the sector advanced 1.3 per cent.Motorola helped to limit losses in the tech sector to 0.4 per cent. The company surged 11.5 per cent to $9.82 after it hired Sanjay Jha, a former Qualcomm executive, to head its mobile devices business.There was some good news from the “real economy” as well. The Commerce Department said that factory orders rose 1.7 per cent in June – the largest jump since December.But that did little for the industrials as deal news and analyst downgrades weighed on the sector. Manitowoc, the construction group, fell 10.3 per cent to $23.03 after it agreed to sell its marine unit to Lockheed Martin and an Italian shipbuilder for $120m.Meanwhile, Deere dropped 7.1 per cent to $65.24 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock from “buy” to “neutral”, pointing to weakness in the domestic construction market and higher raw material costs.The banking sector was another drag, falling 1.3 per cent after HSBC said losses in North America increased in the first half.Bank of America fell 2.1 per cent to $32.62, Wells Fargo slipped 1.1 per cent to $30.18 and JPMorgan lost 1.5 per cent to $40.14.Wachovia was among the biggest fallers, sliding 9.9 per cent to $17.11, after analysts at Morgan Keegan suggested investors “take profits” from a recent run-up in the share price “driven by covering”."
353;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-08-01T20:56:51Z;US stocks fall as investors digest jobs data;;Wall Street stocks fell for a second session on Friday, and trimmed already modest weekly gains, as investors wrestled with downbeat jobs data, poor results from General Motors and a bump in the price of oil.The latest employment report from the Labor Department showed that the US economy shed jobs for a seventh successive month in July, although the decline was slightly smaller than expected. The unemployment rate rose from 5.5 per cent in June to 5.7 per cent – the highest level since March 2004.Poor results from GM, the largest carmaker in the US, added to the losses. The company said it had made a second-quarter loss of $15.5bn, four times larger than analysts expected, because of the cost of labour disputes and a slump in domestic sales.A bump in the price of oil added to the pressure. GM shares fell 7.6 per cent to $10.27. Ford shares dipped 3.1 per cent to $4.65.By the close nine of the 10 leading industry groups were in the red, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.6 per cent to 1,260.31 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 11,326.32 points. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,310.96 points.Over a volatile week, the Dow edged down 0.3 per cent, the Nasdaq held its ground and the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent due to mixed second-quarter earnings, a decline in the price of oil and some weak data on growth, home prices and employment.Stu Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said: “You could be asking why markets are holding up as well as they are in the face of all of this . . . the S&P 500 was down around 1,200 a few weeks ago and here we are at 1,250 or so. I think a lot of the bad news is already discounted in the market.”S&P 500 company second-quarter profits have fallen 20 per cent on average compared to a year ago, according to Bloomberg data. Profits have slumped about 82 per cent at financials and more than 100 per cent at consumer discretionary companies while energy company profits have grown by 18 per cent. Excluding financials, average earnings on the S&P 500 rose 3 per cent.On Friday, financials were the only gainers as strength in the investment banking sector offset some bad news from exchanges. NYSE Euronext slid 12.9 per cent to $41.15 after it posted second-quarter profits that undershot ambitious analyst estimates.The shares in CME, another exchange operator dropped 7.6 per cent to $332.94 after it said that July daily average trading volume had fallen compared to a year ago.The financial sector as a whole made a late run to take its gain for the week to 4 per cent after Merrill Lynch announced asset sales and capital raising and the markets concluded that the results season had averted worst-case scenarios.Analysts at Barclays Capital said: “Overall, the US banks reported weak but not disastrous second-quarter results, and the markets breathed a sigh of relief.”For much of the session the energy sector was the only one to advance, but disappointing results from Chesapeake Energy, an independent natural-gas producer, and Chevron, the oil producer, eventually took their toll. Chesapeake lost 1.9 per cent to $49.22, Chevron dipped 0.3 per cent to $84.31, and the sector fell 0.4 per cent.Material stocks also fared poorly, hit by new data showing US manufacturing activity stagnated in July. Metals stocks led the materials sector down 2.6 per cent. Titanium Metals dropped 6.8 per cent to $10.50, Nucor fell 6 per cent to $54.78 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 5.6 per cent to $91.31.In healthcare, renewed safety concerns about Biogen Idec’s multiple sclerosis drug weighed on the sector. Biogen slumped 28.3 per cent to $50.01 while the sector gave up 1 per cent.In technology, poor results from Sun Microsystems, weighed on the sector. The maker of server computers said profit fell 73 per cent. Shares retreated 12.3 per cent to $9.32. The sector dipped 0.6 per cent.
354;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-07-02T20:38:07Z;US blue chips buckle under latest oil blow;;Surging oil prices sent US stocks into a tailspin on Wednesday, knocking the S&P 500 below its March lows for the first time and sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average scuttling into bear market territory - down 20 per cent from its recent peak.The benchmark S&P 500 wobbled between gains and losses but closed the day 1.8 per cent lower at 1,261.53 points - its lowest level since July 2006.Technical analysts have warned that a break through the ‘Bear Stearns’ bottom could lead to further sustained weakness with the index retesting its 2002 lows.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.8 per cent to 11,215.51 while the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.5 per cent to 2,292.94. Both are now down more than 20 per cent from their recent peaks.Oil prices smashed through $143 a barrel after a government inventory report showed a sharp drop in crude oil supplies, knocking all ten leading industry groups on the S&P500 into the red.Rising oil prices have been a constant scourge for equity markets in recent months, raising the spectre of spiralling input costs and tumbling corporate profits.The biggest faller on Wednesday was the material sector, which lost 5.3 per cent - its biggest one day fall since March.Energy intensive steel producers fell for a third day. US Steel lost 12.5 per cent to $153.40 and Nucor dropped 14.2 per cent to $61.94.Gold miners also fell back as gold prices dropped. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 6.9 per cent to $107.57 while Newmont Mining lost 4.5 per cent to $50.99.The energy sector also dragged. Coal stocks were the weak link, tumbling as European prices fell the most since 2005. Massey Energy and Consol Energy fell 18.9 per cent to $74.87 and 14.6 per cent to $95.57 respectively.In industrials, transport-related stocks suffered. CSX fell 6.4 per cent to $57.06 while Paccar lost 7 per cent to $39.86.The day began in a positive fashion after European banks dismissed speculation that they would have to raise more cash, bolstering their US peers.But gains were erased after another rash of analyst downgrades while comments by Hank Paulson also took their toll. The Treasury secretary proposed the president should have to approve any use of taxpayer funds to aid a financial company in trouble.Citigroup fell 1.7 per cent to $16.84 while Merrill lost 3.4 per cent to $31.15. The financial sector as a whole slipped 1.4 per cent.Macroeconomic news did little to improve the mood. New data from the Commerce Department showed US factory orders climbed a faster-than-expected 0.6 per cent in May for a third monthly increase.Any positive momentum was curtailed by the ADP Employer Services report, which showed private companies cut jobs at four times the expected rate in June.Carmakers came under renewed pressure after analysts at Merrill Lynch punctured the euphoria surrounding General Motors sales figures, which were released on Tuesday.The brokerage downgraded GM from “buy” to “underperform” and cut its 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates, citing lower forecasts for US car sales and noting that “bankruptcy is not impossible.”GM fell 15.1 per cent to $9.98 while Ford dipped 7.4 per cent to $4.36.The consumer discretionary sector also slipped back 1.7 per cent as oil prices rose. Liz Claibornlost 6.6 per cent to $13.08 while Staplesfell 4.9 per cent to $23.12.Starbucks clung to a 0.4 per cent gain at $15.68, buoyed by plans to cut 7 per cent of its workforce and close 600 stores as part of efforts to revitalise the coffee chain.Blockbuster rose 5.8 per cent to $2.65 after it dropped a $1.35bn bid for Circuit City Stores the lossmaking electronics retailer. Circuit City shares slumped 9 per cent to $2.32.The technology sector was volatile. Semiconductors were the worst performing subsector, while software and services companies followed close behind.But there were exceptions. Yahoo climbed 3.4 per cent to $20.88 after the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft had approached media companies about teaming up for a break-up deal. Microsoft fell 3.7 per cent to $25.88.Meanwhile, Dell shares rallied 2. per cent to $23.70 after chief executive Michael Dell revealed he had bought 4.5m shares in the company at between $21.89 and $22.39 since June 27.
355;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-06-11T20:40:57Z;Wall St falls led by financials;;Wall Street fell sharply on Wednesday as financials resumed their relentless downward path and technology stocks came under heavy selling pressure after a key industry group cut its sales outlook for semi­conductors.In the background, oil prices jumped more than $5 a barrel, taking the momentum out of Tuesday’s shallow rally in consumer-facing shares. The consumer discretionary sector fell 2.2 per cent while the homebuilder sub-sector fell 8 per cent to within touching distance of a seven-year low.The leading fallers, however, were financial stocks, which dropped 3.3 per cent, giving up recent fragile gains and suggesting that the sector has yet to find a solid bottom amid a steady trickle of bad news.Technology stocks followed close behind, slipping 2.4 per cent after the Semiconductor Industry Association said sales will grow less rapidly than expected this year as competition drives down prices, particularly for memory chips.Nine of the 10 leading industry sectors were in the red, dragging the S&P 500 index down 1.7 per cent to 1,335.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.7 per cent to 12,083.69. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2 per cent to 2,394.01.The tone on Wall Street has perceptibly darkened over the past few weeks as investors cope with bad news from financials and look ahead to rising inflation, weak consumer spending and a prolonged period of depressed earnings.While the S&P 500 posted monthly gains of 1.1 per cent and 4.8 per cent in April and May, so far in June the benchmark index is down 4.6 per cent.Scott Armiger, a vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust, said: “We were thinking that you would see some signs of expansion in the second half, and now it seems that it is going to be a long, hot summer and perhaps we won’t start to recover until next year.”Financials reprised their role as the villains of the piece on Wednesday and have fallen in all but two sessions in June. The sector is down 23.8 per cent this year.Washington Mutual, First Horizon and Huntington Bancshares fell 9.3 per cent to $6.06, 6 per cent to $8.27 and 6.5 per cent to $6.92 respectively. The banks have some of the highest exposures to home equity loans, which some analysts see as the next front in the ongoing credit crisis.Investment banks also took a beating as Lehman Brothers fell a 13.6 per cent to $23.75, dragging the sector down 5.3 per cent. It was followed by Merrill Lynch, down 6.6 per cent to $35.46. Matthew Albrecht, an equity analyst with S&P, said: “Preliminary results from Lehman Brothers should remind investors that this group is not out of the woods regarding mortgage and bridge loan exposure, and risk governance remains in focus.”Industrials came under pressure after UBS rated Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the railway company, a “short-term sell”, suggesting rising fuel prices may impact second-quarter earnings. Burlington dropped 7 per cent to $103.77, dragging down peers Union Pacific and CSX, which slipped 5.7 per cent to $74.10 and 4 per cent to $63.60 respectively. CSX is in the middle of a messy proxy battle with British hedge fund The Children’s Investment Fund.Energy stocks were the sole gainers amid the broader malaise, following oil prices higher. ExxonÂ­Mobil rose 0.8 per cent to $88.61 and ConocoPhillips added 1.3 per cent to $94.08.Materials stocks fell in spite of some positive momentum for gold focused shares. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, for example, rose 0.6 per cent to $120.09.Gains for the broader sector were swamped, however, after JPMorgan downgraded Alcoa from “overweight” to “neutral”, suggesting that the aluminium producer would likely not be a take­over target. Alcoa dropped 8 per cent to $39.32.In technology, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel were among the leading fallers, losing 6.3 per cent to $6.96 and 3.8 per cent to $21.81 respectively.Amerigroup, the managed healthcare provider, fell 14.1 per cent to $23.36. It suspended its annual profit forecast as higher-than-expected claims forced it to renegotiate rates with the state of Tennessee.Meanwhile, Staples succeeded in its efforts to buy Corporate Express, a Dutch peer, with a revised $2.7bn offer. Staples shares rose 5.3 per cent to $24.38.
356;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-06-10T17:33:55Z;Vale set to issue $15bn in shares;;Vale, the Brazilian mining group that walked away from takeover talks with Xstrata in March, on Tuesday said it was preparing to issue up to $15bn in voting and non-voting shares to finance growth, acquisitions and debt rescheduling.Shares in Vale fell on concerns that an acquisition could stretch its borrowing beyond comfortable limits and threaten its investment grade rating from the world’s leading credit rating agencies.However, shares in possible acquisition targets rose strongly. Alcoa, the US-based aluminium producer, gained as much as 4 per cent on Monday on rumours of the Vale issue and a further 3.7 per cent in early trading on Tuesday before falling back.Shares in Freeport McMoRan, a US-based copper and gold miner, gained as much as 5 per cent on Tuesday morning before relaxing a little.Rumours were also circulating that Vale could be looking at its rival Anglo-American, contemplating joining a planned merger between Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, or even reviving an offer for Anglo-Swiss miner Xstrata, with which it negotiated a proposed acquisition for several months before talks broke down.Vale’s cash and share bid for Xstrata was expected to be worth as much as $90bn. The company had lined up about $50bn to finance the deal from a group of international banks.That Vale – the world’s biggest producer of iron ore – was able to secure such a package during a time of crisis on the world’s financial markets was taken as a vote of confidence in its ability to absorb a large acquisition and it is likely that Vale would be able to draw on that support again.So the announced share issue has raised expectations that one or other acquisition is in the pipeline, although Vale insisted on Tuesday that no such negotiations were under way.Freeport and Alcoa have been seen as likely targets for Vale for some time.Francisco Alves, editor of Brasil Mineral magazine in São Paulo, said Freeport was the most likely target as it would fill a gap in Vale’s non-ferrous portfolio.“Vale chose copper as one of its priorities when it opened its mine at Carajás [in northern Brazil],” he said. Mr Alves said Freeport was priced attractively and that, with a 20 to 30 per cent premium on its market value, Vale could buy it for less than $50bn.Alcoa is also regarded as a good fit for Vale, which has large reserves of bauxite and is already a significant supplier of both bauxite and alumina, the intermediary stage between bauxite and aluminium.Analysts say Alcoa would be a natural partner in producing aluminium both in Brazil and overseas.Vale refused to be drawn on the timing of the issue, although Mr Alves said he expected the issue to take place quickly, as early as next month.
357;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-06-09T20:49:54Z;Lehman losses end hopes of Wall St bounce;;"In a bumpy session of trading on Monday, Wall Street rebounded limply from Friday’s dramatic sell-off as analyst upgrades buoyed the energy sector offsetting another poor session for financials.Energy stocks were the leading gainers after Goldman Sachs recommended investors buy into the sector, highlighting ConocoPhillips and Hess, among others. Goldman analysts said share prices were relatively inexpensive while high oil prices might boost earnings.The sector has massively outperformed the broader S&P 500, adding 8.3 per cent compared with a 7.3 per cent decline. ExxonMobil, Conoco-Phillips and Hess added 2.6 per cent to $89.07, 3.3 per cent to $95.24 and 2.9 per cent to $127.47 respectively.Those gains helped markets skim past news of record losses at Lehman Brothers and comments from Fed officials that higher interest rates might be needed to curb inflation.The KBW banking index set new multi-year lows, while the S&P 500 index of financials fell 2.3 per cent.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,361.77 points; the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent at 12,280.32 points. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,459.46 points.On Friday the Dow Jones suffered its biggest one-day fall since February 2007 as equity markets were hit by surging oil prices and a jump in the unemployment rate that pointed to continued recession-like conditions in the US economy.Some analysts argued that this was an over-reaction and stocks seesawed between gains and losses in afternoon trading.There were bright spots. McDonald’s rose 4.1 per cent to $59.31 after the fast-food chain said it had made gains in May same-store sales due to strong international demand. That did not stop the wider sector from falling 0.1 per cent.New data that showed a surprise rise in pending home sales in April helped improve sentiment. According to the National Association of Realtors, the index of pending home re-sales rose 6.3 per cent to 88.2, the highest level in six months. That too had a limited impact and an index of homebuilding stocks slipped 0.9 per cent.Energy and materials stocks were leading gainers, up 2.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.Alcoa rose 7.5 per cent to $42.17 after Barron’s said the aluminium producer could rise markedly in value to $60 a share if it were to become a takeover target, citing a Citigroup analyst. Monsanto rose 2 per cent to $138.45 while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 2.2 per cent to $118.26.Banking sector travails curbed those gains. Lehman, the smallest of the leading investment banks, said it lost $2.8bn in the second quarter and that it would raise $6bn in new capital.Fitch, the credit ratings agency, downgraded Lehman, while its peer Moody’s lowered its ratings outlook for the brokerage. Lehman, which has lost more than half its value in the past year, fell 8.7 per cent to $29.48, striking a 52-week lows before recovering slightly. The news hit the financial sector, which is reeling from the protracted fall-out from the subprime mortgage crisis.Merrill Lynch fell 3.2 per cent to $37.76, JPMorgan lost 6.4 per cent to $37.51 and
Citigroup slid 2.3 per cent to $19.60. A UBS note suggesting Washington Mutual would suffer $21.7bn in mortgage losses through 2011 crushed the banks’ share price, while earnings downgrades for Fifth Third Bancorp and KeyCorp weighed on their stocks.WaMu slipped 17 per cent to $6.25, Fifth Third Bancorp edged up 0.2 per cent to $16.78 and KeyCorp fell 3.8 per cent to $16.65.In the past few weeks analysts have slashed earnings estimates for the financials sector with the result that according to Thomson Reuters the consensus estimate is for a 45 per cent decline in the second quarter.Technology shares slipped in spite of a positive note on the sector from Lehman.Apple led the fallers, off 2.2 per cent to $181.61 as investors took profits after the company unveiled a new and cheaper iPhone. Google slipped 1.6 per cent to $557.87 while Intel fell 1.8 per cent to $22.49.According to Thomson Reuters, tech is expected to achieve the second-highest earnings growth rate among leading industry sectors in the second quarter of 2008."
358;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-06-02T17:05:02Z;Case study: Iryan mine sparks green approach;;It was a letter-writing campaign by Dutch environmentalists about the social and ecological impact of a huge gold and copper mine in Indonesia that set ABN Amro thinking about sustainability in project finance a decade ago.The Grasberg mine, majority owned by Freeport-McMoRan, in the remote province of Papua, had long been a source of friction between the local population and its operators but when that spilled over into unrest in late 1997 it drew wider attention and prompted questions about the Dutch bank’s role in financing the project.“It was a wake-up call,” recalls Herman Mulder, who had just been appointed head of group risk at the Dutch lender and co-chair of its group risk committee. “Like Shell had the Brent Spar, we had this mine in West Iryan.”After the Dutch chapter of Friends of the Earth approached ABN Amro and 800 letters arrived from concerned clients, the bank ordered an investigation.“There were security issues, there were labour issues, there were environmental issues, there were even some ethical issues,” says Mr Mulder. “My colleague who was country manager in Indonesia went to the mine and reported back that he felt there was indeed substance to the claim.”From a risk point of view, it seemed obvious that the bank should pull out. However, to ABN Amro’s surprise, Friends of the Earth insisted that it engage with the operators to improve local policies.A decade on, Freeport-McMoRan produces annual sustainability reports highlighting its work with local communities and efforts to return disused areas to nature, among other projects. And ABN Amro was named sustainable bank of the year last year.The Grasberg episode prompted ABN Amro to add non-financial elements to its risk models.Mr Mulder, who describes himself as a “convert” to sustainability, left ABN Amro in mid-2006 after 25 years to pursue the advocacy of sustainable development in business.A crunch point came in 2002 when the bank lost an oil project in Latin America because it declined to waive an environmental impact study.“That created quite a debate,” says Mr Mulder.Fortunately for the Dutch bank, the rest of the industry was changing – in October 2002 what became known as the Equator Principles were drafted with the help of the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank. Initially, 10 banks signed up. That has since grown to 60.“I said we should be competing on price, on structure, on quality of service, not on fundamental principles and values,” says Mr Mulder, who played a key role in developing the principles.The changing business environment also gave banks such as ABN Amro the chance to use their sustainability credentials as a business differentiator, not just an extra element of risk management.What the bank also discovered as a leader in the field was that it would come in for close and critical scrutiny.Last year, the bank again attracted the attention of Friends of the Earth, which labelled it a “climate laggard” and ranked it the worst of all Dutch banks in terms of the sums it invested in fossil fuels.For Mr Mulder, that kind of attention is not necessarily a bad thing.“Any [non-governmental organisation] will say that: yes, we target the leaders in the sector because in that way we put more pressure on the laggards in the sector,” he says. In this case, he adds, the poor ranking was a result of heavy exposure to the natural resources sector, which is “difficult to address overnight”.Following the acquisition of ABN Amro by a consortium of banks last year, there are now questions over the future of its sustainability drive.Mr Mulder says he is confident that the bank’s operations in India, now owned by RBS, and Brazil, owned by Santander, would continue to be leaders in the field. In the Netherlands, RBS and Fortis – both signatories to the Equator Principles – are splitting the bank’s operations.“I’d hope that RBS and Fortis will take on this important issue,” Mr Mulder says. The principles are a start, but not the same as “really believing it and it being part of your DNA and assuming a leadership role, which is what ABN Amro did”.
359;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-05-30T21:02:52Z;Wall St pares gains but ends week higher;;Wall Street stocks were mixed on Friday, but remained ahead for the week and the month, as data showing moderating inflation and a modest rally in commodity related and technology stocks balanced against concerns about the health of the US consumer.On the inflation front, a gauge of core inflation favoured by the Federal Reserve rose 0.1 per cent month on month. That is slower than the 0.2 per cent rate of the previous month.New data from the Department of Commerce on personal consumption, income and expenditures released as a package with the inflation numbers suggested the US consumer remains under pressure if not yet under water.News that consumer spending increased 0.2 per cent in April but was unchanged after adjustments for inflation hurt consumer-facing stocks.A bump in some commodity prices, however, and a handful of better-than-expected results from technology companies, more than offset those losses.By the close on Friday in New York, the S&P 500 pared earlier gains but finished the holiday-shortened week 2 per cent higher at 1,400.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped into the red in late trading, losing 0.1 per cent to 12,638 while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.6 per cent to 2,522.66.In the past few days, equities have recovered some of the ground they lost last week as energy prices have softened and government data have suggested the US may skirt a recession.That meek rebound pushed the S&P 500 to a 2 per cent advance in this holiday-shortened week and a monthly gain of 1 per cent – its first back-to-back set of monthly gains since October last year.The strongest sector in May was technology, up 5.4 per cent, displacing energy and materials as the leading group.Strategists argue that international exposure, tight capacity and high levels of recurring revenues make technology a robust sector in the current slowdown.That resilience was underlined by Dell, the personal-computer maker, which posted estimate-beating profits thanks to strong international sales. The results brought a number of analyst upgrades in their wake and Dell shares climbed 5.7 per cent to $23.06.Marvell Technology, the mobile phone-chip maker, also outperformed. Lower administrative expenses and improved sales helped the company beat expectations for first-quarter profits. Marvell shares soared 23.3 per cent to $17.36.Material stocks were the second-biggest gainers over the month, rising 4.5 per cent, and they made progress again on Friday.Monsanto rose 2.9 per cent to $127.40, US Steel added 1.2 per cent to $172.71 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 2.2 per cent to $115.71.Only financials lost ground over the month. Slashed earnings estimates from analysts, writedowns and fears that the sector must raise yet more capital have cut 6.4 per cent from the sector – its worst monthly performance since February.Jeffrey Layman, chief investment officer at BKD Wealth Advisors, said that the post Bear Stearns bail-out euphoria had well and truly worn off.“Back in March we averted a ‘big ugly’ and the sector rallied. But now the stocks are trading back down as investors recognise there will be no quick work-through and we are in a more difficult profit environment,” he said.Consumer discretionary stocks fell back on Friday as investors found cause for concern in the spending statistics and in revised May numbers for consumer confidence, which hit the lowest level in 28 years.Among the leading fallers were JC Penney and Coach, which dropped 3.1 per cent to $40.24 and 2.4 per cent to $36.30 respectively, while the wider sector slipped 0.4 per cent.There were bright spots. Tiffany said strong growth in the Asia-Pacific and European markets had helped boost first-quarter profits 19 per cent.The upmarket jewellery retailer said, however, that it expected no improvement in the US until later this year. Tiffany shares advanced 2.7 per cent to $49.03.
360;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-05-29T20:40:38Z;US stocks rise as oil prices edge down;;Wall Street stocks rose for a third straight session on Thursday as oil prices dropped, financials rallied on a bullish analyst report and data showed the US economy grew faster than previously thought in the first quarter.Crude prices dipped well below $130 a barrel on Thursday, giving companies dependent on discretionary consumer spending a boost.Some macroeconomic data also buoyed sentiment. In spite of inflation and the credit crisis, first-quarter gross domestic product came in at a revised 0.9 per cent, suggesting the US economy may yet skirt a full-blown recession.A rally in financials kicked markets into decidedly positive territory after a report from JPMorgan predicted the sector was due for a bounce based on tightening spreads on bank credit default swaps.Still, a rise in the number of Americans making first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week, after an unexpected fall in the prior week, held gains in check.The benchmark S&P 500 trimmed gains at the close but remained 0.5 per cent higher at 1,398.23 for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 0.4 per cent at 12,646.22. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.9 per cent to 2,508.32.In the past few days, equities have recovered about half the ground they lost last week as softening energy prices have offered some respite to US consumers.Rising prices are having a mixed impact on corporations and households. On Thursday, Sears Holdings, the department store chain, reported an unexpected first-quarter net loss, knocking its share price 3.6 per cent to $86.14.Analysts said that the store’s middle-of-the-range goods were particularly susceptible to the current economic slowdown as consumers were trading down to cheaper brands in order to save money. Conversely, Big Lots, which sells excess inventory, reported better-than-expected quarterly profits and raised its full-year earnings forecast.HJ Heinz was another consumer-facing company to report positive results and forecasts. The food group said fourth-quarter profit rose thanks to gains from currency effects and higher prices and raised its predictions for full-year earnings.Big Lots shares climbed 7.5 per cent to $30.66, Heinz climbed 3.6 per cent to $49.25, while the consumer discretionary sector added 1 per cent.Whether corporations will be able to maintain that earnings growth going forward remains a moot point.Alongside the other data released on Thursday, the Department of Commerce noted that corporate profit growth during the first quarter rose 3.8 per cent after falling 3.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year.The headline numbers may go some way to easing fears that corporate profits will be swamped by rising costs and falling demand. But the details were less salutary as domestic profits and profits from financial firms both declined.Many are sceptical about the broader earnings outlook. Strategists at UBS said: “Estimates for this year may still be a bit high given our forecast for slowing growth and peaking margins . . . Moreover, estimates for 2009 appear far too rosy, driven by a forecast record expansion of profit margins.”Some of the weakest performers earlier in the week were amongst the strongest gainers on Thursday. Healthcare advanced 1.5 per cent in part due to a Goldman Sachs recommendation that investors should by call options in the sector.Merck was a notable gainer, adding 0.7 per cent to $38.92 after a series of court decisions overturned claims against the pharmaceutical giant resulting from its withdrawn painkiller, Vioxx.Consumer staples and financials added 1.1 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively.In financials, Bank of America, which rose 2.2 per cent to $34.60 and Citigroup, which added 2 per cent to $22.04, led the way.MasterCard was another stand-out, rising 7.7 per cent to $309, after it raised its targets for profit growth. Rivals Visa and American Express advanced 4.1 per cent to $85.25 and 1.3 per cent to $46.75 respectively.But material and energy stocks followed commodity prices lower, losing 0.9 per cent each. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and ConocoPhillips dropped 5.4 per cent to $113.18 and 1.7 per cent to $90.96.
361;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-05-05T20:30:26Z;Wall Street stocks lower as Yahoo slides;;Wall Street stocks slipped from recent highs on Monday, as oil broke through $120 a barrel and Yahoo tumbled after Microsoft withdrew its improved $46.5bn bid for the internet search company.Over the weekend Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, said the two companies had been unable to agree a price. The software giant had offered as much as $33 a share but Yahoo held out for $37 a share.The deal’s collapse brings to an end a series of long and at times bad-tempered negotiations. A combination of Microsoft and Yahoo could have transformed the technology sphere, creating an internet search company with the clout to take on Google’s overwhelming lead.Yahoo shares fell 15 per cent to $24.37 while Microsoft shares lost 0.6 per cent to $29.08.Markets briefly pared early losses after a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed that service industries in the US unexpectedly grew in April.But record high oil prices undercut positive sentiment, knocking 1.3 per cent off an index of consumer discretionary stocks. Limited Brands dropped 4.5 per cent to $17.82 while Macy’s fell 4.6 per cent to $25.09.Analysts at Wachovia estimate that consumers now spend 57 cents out of every dollar on core needs, such as food and transportation, eroding their ability to buy other items.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down for the first time in three sessions, dropping 0.5 per cent to 1,407.48 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7 per cent to 12,969.54 while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,464.12 points.Last week, the leading indices hit their highest levels since early January. The S&P 500 rose above 1,400 points and the Dow Jones settled above 13,000.Economists gave credit for the improved tone to the Fed’s measures to pump liquidity into financial markets, better-than-expected macro-economic data and optimism about the upcoming fiscal stimulus package.Company results during the first quarter earnings season also avoided the blood-bath many had feared.With the peak reporting weeks over, 63 per cent of companies had revealed earnings above analysts’ reduced expectations, 11 per cent had met expectations and 26 per cent had missed expectations – a fairly typical distribution.But experts worry the equity market rally and resilient corporate profits will prove to be short-lived.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said: “This relaxation is unlikely to mark the start of a sustainable recovery. The main reason is that the gaping hole in the side of the US economy – namely the drop in house prices from their over-inflated levels – shows no signs of abating any time soon”.The woes of financials continue to make headlines and drag on equity markets. Countrywide Financial led the sector lower after analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co said Bank of America should reduce or ditch its $4bn takeover of the embattled US mortgage lender. If the deal proceeds it could lead to writedowns of as much as $30bn, the analysts said. Countrywide fell 10.4 per cent to $5.36, Bank of America dipped 2.1 per cent to $38.97 while an index of financials lost 1.5 per cent.Unusually, Berkshire Hathaway, the company of investment guru Warren Buffett, was in the losers column on Monday. Berkshire shares dropped 2.7 per cent to $130,000 after it reported a fall in profits because of falling insurance rates and a hit from derivative contracts.In other deal news, Sprint Nextel shares climbed 10.5 per cent to $8.72 after reports that Deutsche Telekom was considering a bid for the struggling US company.The news was not enough to push the telecoms sector into the black as dismal results from Citizensweighed on sentiment. Citizens shares fell 6.8 per cent to $10.53, while an index of telecoms stocks dropped 0.5 per cent.Only materials and energy stocks were able to find any positive momentum as they followed commodity prices higher.Gold miners Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining climbed 5.2 per cent to $115.99 and 1.9 per cent to $45.35, respectively. Oil services companies Smith International and BJ Services added 3.5 per cent to $78.10 and 2.9 per cent to $28.36, respectively.
362;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-05-02T20:55:21Z;Wall Street rises after jobs data;;US stock markets ended the week at their highest levels since the start of the year after the government said US employers cut fewer jobs than expected last month and the Federal Reserve stepped up efforts to unfreeze the credit markets.According to the US Department of Labor, 20,000 jobs were shed in April– the fourth consecutive month of losses – but that was far fewer than many feared and the unemployment rate moderated somewhat.That better-than-expected data, as well as stable numbers on growth and manufacturing activity released in the week, have reinforced impressions that, while the US economy is languishing, it is still clinging on to sluggish growth.News that US and European central banks plan to take further steps to pump liquidity into strained credit markets, also boosted stocks but as the day progressed, a rally in commodity prices pegged equities back.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,413.92 on the day, and 1.2 per cent ahead for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 13,057.80 yesterday while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 2,476.99.During an uneven week, the major indices hit their highest levels since early January with the S&P 500 breaking the 1,400 level and the Dow Jones settling above 13,000. In April, the S&P 500 added about 4.8 per cent – its best monthly showing since the end of 2003 and its first positive month since last October.The week began in downbeat fashion, with volumes low and stocks falling ahead of a rate decision from the Federal Reserve. Data showing that two pillars of the US economy – house prices and consumer confidence – continue to crumble, also weighed on confidence.Markets perked up only briefly on news that Mars, the privately owned confectioner, would purchase chewing gum heavyweight Wrigley for $23bn. Wrigley shares soared 21.7 per cent to $75.99 over the week.Energy and material stocks proved a drag on indices, however, after commodity prices slipped off recent highs at the start of the week and ExxonMobil posted disappointing results.Exxon fell 3.1 per cent to $89.61, Monsanto slipped 8.2 per cent to $115.22 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dipped 5.8 per cent to $110.23. The two sectors rallied yesterday but that late charge could not overcome earlier losses and they closed the week down 1.8 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively.Energy’s discomfort proved a boon for consumer discretionary stocks, however, and the sector added 2.5 per cent over the week.On Wednesday, the Fed cut interest rates and sentiment initially wobbled but turned positive the following day as financial and technology stocks raced ahead.Symantec and Juniper Networks were among the biggest gainers over the week, climbing 11.3 per cent to $19.45 and 7.8 per cent to $28.79, respectively.Sun Microsystems took some of the shine off the sector yesterday though, after it reported a surprise third-quarter net loss. Over the week, its shares tumbled 18.6 per cent to $12.64.Financials performed well, adding 2.4 per cent over the week, led by some of the institutions most badly damaged by the subprime crisis.Ambac, the bond insurer, surged 39.4 per cent to $5.38, Merrill Lynch added 6.2 per cent to $52.71 and CIT Group rose 19.8 per cent to $12.91.The S&P 500 has now rallied about 10 per cent from its March lows but experts remain divided about whether that trend will continue. Many are sceptical that US corporations can meet still optimistic earnings growth estimates for the full year and point out that misses could weigh on equity markets.Larry Smith, chairman and chief investment officer of Third Wave Global Investors, however, argued that macro-economic drivers, such as actions by the Fed, were turning the tide in a more positive direction.Indeed certain key measures of risk appetite have already picked up.“People’s mindsets are very much in the recessionary camp and as those mindsets improve the stock markets will improve with it,” he said.
363;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-05-01T20:45:37Z;Wall St rises as tech stocks rally;;Wall Street stocks powered ahead on Thursday driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average, above 13,000 for the first time since early January after a rally in financial and technology stocks offset an earnings disappointment from ExxonMobil and a sagging energy sector.Analysts said that the vices of commodities rather than the virtues of the banking and technology sectors were behind the unlikely surge.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research said: “It seems that money is rotating from the previous leaders – commodity stocks, gold, agricultural stocks – into the laggards.”“ExxonMobil’s ‘poor’ earnings hurt oil stocks, and oil prices have also come off highs, so money moved out of the sector into financials and tech stocks.”An index of financial stocks added 3.9, its best one-day gain in a month, taking the sector to its highest level since February.The energy sector suffered however retreating 2.2 per cent as the dollar rallied and commodities prices slipped.A broad upswing carried eight out of 10 key sectors into positive territory and lifted the S&P 500 1.7 per cent to 1,409.33, its biggest gain in almost two weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5 per cent to 13,010, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.8 per cent to 2,465.76.On Wednesday the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate but an equivocal accompanying statement knocked equity markets.On Thursday began in similarly downbeat fashion after Exxon and weak employment data showing soaring first-time benefit claims initially weighed on the market. Still, an Institute for Supply Management index showing that manufacturing activity was weak but steady in April, helped calm nerves.Merrill Lynch was one of the leading beneficiaries from the volte face, jumping 5.1 per cent to $52.39 after the head of a Kuwait sovereign wealth fund said it may increase its holding in the investment bank.Comments overnight by Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, who said that the credit crisis was closer to the end than the beginning, supported the rally. Lehman Brothers rose 6.1 per cent to $46.93, Citigroup added 4.2 per cent to $25.99 and Bank of America gained 4.9 per cent to $39.39.CIT Group jumped 10.1 per cent to $11.99 on speculation that the independent finance company, which has been badly hit by credit market turmoil, would be sold.MBIA jumped 12.9 per cent to $11.74 after Jay Brown, its chief executive, told shareholders that the the embattled bond insurer, has enough capital to retain its triple A rating.Technology stocks were particularly strong last month after a number of industry heavyweights reported better-than-expected results and that trend continued on Thursday.The sector rose 3.2 per cent, thanks in part to Symantec. The maker of security software jumped 12.3 per cent to $19.34 after it said fourth-quarter profit tripled. Semiconductor companies also contributed to the rally after new data showed chip sales rose in March and a handful of decent earnings reports boosted sentiment. Intel rose 4.6 per cent to $23.29 while AMD added 4.4 per cent to $6.22.ExxonMobil took some of the shine of equity markets after it reported massive profits but undershot expectations super-charged by record high oil prices. Shares in the energy group fell 3.6 per cent to $89.70, while Chevron slipped 1.3 per cent to $94.94.Materials stocks also performed poorly. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold slumped 5.1 per cent to $107.96 while Nucor fell 2.2 per cent to $73.82.Larry Smith, chairman and chief investment officer of Third Wave Global Investors, said: “We may be seeing the end of the commodity bull run. There has been a lot of speculative money, some of it from hedge funds, chasing up prices. When prices stop going up that money will go away and we could see a big reversal.”Energy’s discomfort proved a boon for consumer discretionary stocks, which rose 3.3 per cent – their best showing in a month.Comcast, the largest cable operator in the US, was among the top performers, cheering investors with on-target first-quarter results. Comcast shares rose 8.6 per cent to $22.31.

365;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-04-29T21:04:48Z;Wall St lower ahead of Fed decision;;Wall Street stocks hung in the doldrums on Tuesday as investors digested data showing that two pillars of the US economy – house prices and consumer confidence – continue to crumble, and a sell-off in commodities hit related stocks.The day began in downbeat fashion as markets reacted poorly to the S&P/Case Shiller 20-city house price index, which plunged for a 10th consecutive month and at an accelerating rate. The three-month annualised rate of decline in US house prices is now nearly 25 per cent.That prospect continues to damp consumer confidence. The latest survey showed consumer confidence hit the lowest level since just before the US-led invasion of Iraq.Julian Jessop at Capital Economics, said: “The financial markets may have decided that the glass is half full but consumers remain stubbornly miserable . . . All things considered, the downbeat views of consumers appear much closer to reality.”The biggest drag, however, was the materials sector which dipped 3.1 per cent, its biggest fall in over a month, following commodities prices lower.A mini-rally in technology, which climbed for the first time in three sessions, and some steady performances from consumer discretionary stocks helped markets retain a measure of composure.After a light session of trading, the benchmark S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,390.96, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 12,831.94. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,426.10.Investors remain listless ahead of a likely 25 basis point rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and a host of potentially market-moving economic data to be released later in the week.With volumes on the low side, equity markets have treaded water for much of the week so far, piqued only by news that Mars, the confectioner, could purchase chewing-gum heavyweight Wrigley for $23bn, aided by Warren Buffett.Healthcare stocks lagged as poor earnings, analyst downgrades and news of drug approval setbacks hit the sector. Merck led the fallers, dropping 10.4 per cent to $37.14 after its cholesterol pill failed to win approval. It was followed by Medco Health, down 4.3 per cent to $49.12, and Tenet Healthcare, down 2.2 per cent to $6.55.Financials were in focus after Countrywide, the mortgage lender that Bank of America has agreed to buy, reported its third quarterly loss in a row. Analysts said the results may lead Bank of America to reduce or even cancel its offer to buy the company for $4bn in stock.Countrywide shares rose 0.3 per cent to $5.85, while Bank of America lost 0.8 per cent to $37.86 and the wider sector was mixed. The S&P 500 index of financial shares ended the day down 0.6 per cent.According to KBW, of the 119 banks it covers, just over half have missed consensus earnings estimates, because of rapidly deteriorating assets. More worryingly, the growth of non-performing assets has outpaced that of reserves suggesting more problems lie ahead.Despite the negative data, homebuilder stocks, which have been unpredictable in the face of the ever-deepening housing slump, were mixed on Tuesday. DR Horton dropped 2.7 per cent to $16.69 and Pulte Homes slid 2.8 per cent to $13.80 but Lennar and Centex added 3.8 per cent to $20.28 and 4 per cent to $22.27 respectively.In materials, the mood was broadly pessimistic. Titanium Metals lost 6.1 per cent to $15.95, Monsanto fell 9.1 per cent to $110.93 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 4.4 per cent to $110.72.But there were bright spots. Office Depot said first-quarter profits fell less than expected and its shares advanced 8.7 per cent to $13.Credit card companies outperformed. Visa said profit jumped 28 per cent thanks in part to strong international growth. Visa shares, which have risen more than 70 per cent since its $17.9bn initial public offering last month, added 6.9 per cent to $80.85.Meanwhile, MasterCard, Visa’s main rival, popped 12.7 per cent to $273.34 after it said first-quarter profit soared 85 per cent to $398m thanks to strong revenues, beating estimates.Technology was among the strongest sectors in the S&P 500 on the day. Corning added 3.3 per cent to $26.53 after it said first-quarter profit more than tripled, and Yahoo and Motorola climbed 3.6 per cent to $27.37 and 5.7 per cent to $10 respectively.
366;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-04-24T20:48:38Z;Wall Street rally led by financials;;Wall Street stocks rallied for a second day on Thursday as financials led markets higher and investors picked out the positive in a mixed batch of earnings reports.The day began in gloomy fashion as cautious outlook statements from several corporations, including Apple and Amazon, stirred fears of a consumer-spending slowdown.Materials and energy stocks, which have supported equity markets for much of the past few weeks, had their worst day in over a month, following commodity prices lower in spite of strong results from industry leaders.But an unexpected rally in financials helped wipe out those declines thanks to upgrades and strong results at a handful of insurance companies.Homebuilders contributed to the turn in sentiment after the National Association of Home Builders said the US housing market would begin to recover in the third quarter, brushing aside new data showing sales of new homes slumped in March.The benchmark S&P 500 erased losses of as much as 0.6 per cent to close up 0.6 per cent at 1,388.82 while the Nasdaq Composite ended 1 per cent higher at 2,428.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,848.95.Financials advanced 3.8 per cent on Thursday, their biggest gain since the start of the month, as investors looking for a bottom to the market rotated out of energy stocks and into the downtrodden sector. T Rowe Price, the fund manager, led the gainers adding 11.8 per cent to $60.24 after posting its 20th straight quarterly increase in earnings.Insurers Travelers and Aflac added to that revival, climbing 4 per cent to $50.23 and 4.1 per cent to $67.76, respectively, after both beat first-quarter estimates and raised their full-year forecasts.Investment banks also made ground after the chief executive of Merrill Lynch said the firm would maintain its dividend. Merrill Lynch added 7.1 per cent to $48.09 while Lehman Brothers rose 6.2 per cent to $46.38.James McGlynn, portfolio manager of the Summit Everest Fund, said: “There was so much uncertainty going into the earnings season, people thought financials were going to drop another shoe, so the stocks have perhaps been overly discounted.”Mike Mayo, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said: “The crises now seems closer to the end, albeit with lingering uncertainty related to monoline insurers, CDO dispositions and short-term money markets.”As oil slipped off its highs and the dollar rallied, giving consumers more wiggle room, JC Penney climbed 3.5 per cent to $41.97 while Macy’s added 5 per cent to $24.36.Ford led the consumer sector higher after the car group unexpectedly swung into profit in the first quarter as reduced costs offset weak US sales. Ford jumped 11.7 per cent to $8.40 while rival General Motors added 5.6 per cent to $22.11.Companies reliant on discretionary spending had initially found it hard going after several bellwethers cut forecasts and were sold by anxious investors.Starbucks tumbled 10.4 per cent to $15.99, Whirlpool, the appliance maker, slid 10.1 per cent to $73.89 and 3M lost 1.7 per cent to $79.25.Homebuilders helped the advance. Lennar added 7.9 per cent to $18.38 while Pulte Homes rose 5.4 per cent to $13.81.In technology, too, early despair gave way to enthusiasm. Better-than-expected results and forecasts from LSI pushed the sector into the black. The maker of storage chips advanced 20.8 per cent to $5.99.By the close, Apple, which added 15 per cent in the month running up to the results, was 3.7 per cent higher at $168.94. Amazon fell 4.1 per cent at $77.69.Energy and materials stocks were a drag on indices. Gold producer Newmont Mining said first-quarter profit rose fivefold thanks to record prices for bullion but its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $42.94, mimicking the pattern of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold on Wednesday. Freeport shares fell 3 per cent to $112.61 while energy groups Chevron and ConocoPhillips dropped 2.2 per cent to $92.40 and 1.8 per cent to $82.96.Industrials rose after Northrop Grumman, the shipbuilder, and Goodrich, the aerospace components maker, posted better-than-expected results. Goodrich shares jumped 9.7 per cent to $67.66 while Northrop climbed 4.4 per cent $72.55.
367;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-04-23T20:42:20Z;Wall St edges up amid positive results;;Wall Street stocks wobbled back into the black on Wednesday as positive earnings news from technology companies and Boeing helped offset weak results and forecasts from Ambac and UPS.A round of decent quarterly earnings helped make the technology sector one of the leading gainers in the S&P 500.Any momentum for the broader indices, however, was undercut by a pull-back in commodities prices, which encouraged investors to sell related stocks.Dismal results from Ambac, the punch-drunk bond insurer, dragged down financials although acquisitions news helped limit the declines.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,379.98 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.2 per cent at 2,405.21. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 per cent to 12,763.22.Wednesday’s hesitant advance broke a two-day losing streak triggered by a batch of below-par reports but analysts are beginning to suggest that the worst fears for first-quarter earnings season were unfounded.Doug Peta, market strategist at J&W Seligman, said: “Earnings have been a pleasant surprise since we got past GE’s results …Markets always overshoot at the top and bottom and perhaps pessimism got overdone.”In technology, Molex, the electrical parts maker, surged 15.2 per cent to $28.56, VMware, the software company, gained 4.9 per cent to $60.84 and Broadcom, which makes chips for Nintendo’s Wii video-game console, jumped 16.3 per cent to $27.39.Meanwhile, Apple shares hit $162.70, adding 1.6 per cent to to its recent run after the company confirmed it had bought PA Semi, a microprocessor designer, for $278m in cash.After the close, the positive trend moderated somewhat as Amazon beat first-quarter earnings forecasts but said full-year operating income may be less than earlier predicted. Its shares fell 6.9 per cent to $75.40 in after- hours trading.In materials, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the second-largest copper producer, said first-quarter profit more than doubled but still dropped 2.2 per cent to $116.08 as gold prices fell back. Peers Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold, also lost 1.8 per cent to $43.85 and 4.5 per cent to $40.78, respectively.Aircraft maker Boeing advanced after it said profit rose 38 per cent to $1.2bn in the first quarter as its backlog of orders grew to a record $346bn. Revenue rose 4 per cent to $16bn and the shares added 4.6 per cent to $82.19.Leading the negative surprises on Wednesday was Ambac Financial.The company undershot Wall Street’s worst expectations, posting a net loss of $1.7bn after a $3.1bn charge for subprime mortgage securities.Ambac shares, which have lost 93 per cent of their value in the past year, plunged 41.8 per cent to $3.51. Peer MBIA dived 33.6 per cent to $8.82.However, news that Liberty Mutual Group, the property and casualty insurer, had agreed to buy Safeco, a home and automobile insurer on the West Coast, for about $6.2bn in cash, helped limit the downside in the financial sector. Safeco shares jumped 45.8 per cent to $65.94.Better-than-expected results from Moody’s, the credit rating company, also helped steady the sector. Moody’s shares gained 2.6 per cent to $37.46 while McGraw-Hill, owner of rival Standard & Poor’s, added 3.3 per cent to $39.41.Downbeat results and comments on the US economy from UPS, the industrial bellwether, left investors largely unmoved. Its shares fell just 0.3 per cent to $71.67.The healthcare sector was in focus after results from WellPoint, the health insurer, and drugmaker Schering-Plough.WellPoint climbed 7.3 per cent to $49.94 after it said it would take aggressive remedial action to address a decline in first-quarter profit due to higher claims.Schering-Plough said profit declined 48 per cent to $291m because of costs associated with buying Organon Biosciences for $16bn in November – but the figure was ahead of most analysts’ estimates. Schering gained 6.6 per cent to $18.27.The day’s biggest gainer was the telecommunications sector, which added 2.2 per cent led by Sprint Nextel. Sprint climbed 8.8 per cent to $7.67 in what some analysts called a relief rally after AT&T’s solid results on Tuesday.
368;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-04-17T20:47:45Z;Wall Street rebound lead by financials;;In a muted session of trading US stock markets went sideways on Thursday as investors weighed a mixed batch of earnings reports and an unlikely rally in the downtrodden financial and consumer discretionary sectors offset losses in healthcare and industrials.Highlighting the ambivalence of much of the day’s earnings news were industrial conglomerates including United Technologies Corp, Danaher and Textron. The trio posted estimate-beating first-quarter profits but cautious outlook statements from UTC and Danaher dented the stocks.UTC fell 2.5 per cent to $70.79, Danaher lost 3.5 per cent to $74.16 and Textron dropped 2.8 per cent to $60.44, dragging the S&P industrials sector down 0.8 per cent.Pfizer also stumbled. The shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $20.40 after the drugmaker said first-quarter profits fell as generic medicines cut into its sales.The news hit competitors Eli Lilly and Merck, which fell 2.2 per cent to $51.39 and 2.7 per cent to $39.22 respectively, knocking 0.8 per cent off the healthcare sector.Meanwhile, a pessimistic outlook statement from Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone company, hurt US rival Motorola, whose shares slid 1.6 per cent to $9.05.By the close, however, a rally in financials helped markets limp into positive territory for a third day in a row. The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the day 0.1 per cent ahead at 1,365.54.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 2,341.83 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly flat for the day at 12,620.16.Positive earnings news from IBM overnight and Google after the close on Thursday which both beat expectations, helped extend a rally in technology stocks that began on Wednesday when bellwether Intel released strong results and forecasts.IBM climbed 2.2 per cent to $123.08. Google said first-quarter profits jumped 30 per cent as expansion abroad more than compensated for a slowdown in advertising spending in the US. Google shares surged 11.8 per cent to $502.66 in after-hours trade.There were other bright spots on Thursday. Trading in the financial sector began in desultory fashion after Merrill Lynch reported its third quarterly loss in a row on $6.5bn of writedowns and said it would slash jobs to reduce costs.But that was broadly in-line with expectations and, by the close, investors had shrugged off the bad news sending Merrill shares, which have lost about half their value in the past year, up 4.1 per cent to $46.71.Its peers, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley, rose 4.6 per cent to $43.64 and 2.2 per cent to $46.42 respectively, while the S&P Financials index gained 1.4 per cent.MGIC, the biggest US mortgage insurer, soared 19 per cent to $12.49 after it lost less money in the first quarter than expected. Be-leagured bond insurers Ambac and MBIA also made ground, adding 8.7 per cent to $5.76 and 9.1 per cent to $12.71 respectively.Supervalu, the second-biggest US supermarket chain, gained 5.3 per cent to $30.60 after it said fourth-quarter profit rose more than analysts had estimated.Leggett & Platt led the consumer discretionary sector 0.4 per cent higher. Shares in the maker of supports for car seats jumped 14.6 per cent to $16.45 on an analyst upgrade.So far this year, the S&P 500 has fallen about 7 per cent as investors worry that a slowing US economy will begin to dent corporate profits. Analysts predict that first-quarter earnings will drop 12.3 per cent in total – a number many see as still too optimistic.For the most part investors skipped past a series of economic reports released on Thursday morning that added depressing details – rising unemployment and a slump in manufacturing activity – to the picture, of stagnation in the US.Materials stocks were also in focus on Thursday. Citigroup cut US Steel from “buy” to “hold”, knocking the shares 0.4 per cent to $154.78.JPMorgan cut International Flavors & Fragrances from “neutral” to “underweight”, sending the shares down 3.2 per cent to $44.65.Wednesday’s biggest gainers also fell. Monsanto, the agricultural group, retreated from its record high, dropping 3.2 per cent to $127.34.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gave up 0.5 per cent to $112.66.
369;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-04-16T20:39:03Z;Wall St rallies on robust results;;US stocks rallied for a second session on Wednesday after JPMorgan Chase, Coca-Cola and other leading companies reported robust results, cheering investors after a lacklustre opening to the 2008 first-quarter earnings season.JPMorgan said profit halved and it took substantial writedowns but the results were roughly in line with expectations and the shares climbed after Jamie Dimon, chief executive, said the credit crisis may be nearing an end.The third-biggest US bank has proven to be one of the more resilient institutions amid recent financial markets turmoil, allowing it to profit from the distress of competitors. Over the past year, its share price has fallen by 11 per cent compared with a 30 per cent fall for the S&P 500 financials index. JPMorgan rose 6.7 per cent to $44.96.Wednesday’s results should go some way towards reassuring investors that other banks about to release their earnings could at least hit reduced analyst targets.Merrill Lynch, which reports on Thursday, rose 3.6 per cent to $44.89 and Citigroup, which reports on Friday, climbed 2.8 per cent to $23.44. The S&P 500 index of financial stocks added 2.3 per cent.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola said first-quarter profit and revenues jumped, thanks to strong trading in Latin America and Russia. It also benefited from the earnings-enhancing effect of a weaker dollar. Shares in Coca-Cola, which have gained about 18 per cent in the last year as investors have looked to consumer staples for a safe haven, added 0.1 per cent to $60.99.The positive results sparked a wider market rally that gained momentum during the day. By the close the benchmark S&P 500 index was 2.3 per cent higher at 1,364.66, its biggest gain since the start of the month. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.8 per cent to 2,350.11 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.1 per cent to 12,619.27.“There is a lot of cash on the sidelines [with investors] desperate for good news so they can get to work and start making some real returns,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim.com, an online brokerage.“Fund managers cannot continue to have 2 per cent 10-year rates, so what we are seeing today is that at any hint of good news, money comes pouring into the market.”That enthusiasm was barely dented by new data showing that inflation rose in March, potentially limiting consumer spending, while housing starts and permits fell to their lowest levels since 1991.In fact, homebuilders rose on the hope that reduced supply might begin to dent the glut of housing stock depressing prices. KB Homes added 6.6 per cent to $24.41 while Lennar climbed 6.3 per cent to $18.50.A vigorous forecast from Intel, the technology sector bellwether that reported after the close on Tuesday, helped maintain positive momentum overnight.Intel shares climbed 6.1 per cent to $22.18 while an index of technology stocks, battered in recent weeks by a series of warnings from major manufacturers, recovered 3.1 per cent.IBM rose 2.8 per cent to $120.47 in after hours trade after it posted big increases in first-quarter profits.Wednesday’s results may go some way to combat the market’s disappointment at earnings misses and reduced forecasts from blue chips Alcoa, UPS and GE last week. The picture now is a mixed one, with pockets of resilience set against a bleak backdrop of a faltering US economy.Amid the broader market rally, the industrials sector was particularly strong, buoyed by sturdy results from CSX, the railroad company. CSX climbed 3.7 per cent to $59.89 while fellow railway company Burlington Northern Santa Fe rose 4.9 per cent to $99.30.The leading sector on the S&P 500, however, was materials.US Steel rose 6 per cent to $155.37 while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gained 7.3 per cent to $113.22. Monsanto hit a record high, gaining 7.2 per cent to $131.54.Oil prices, which touched record highs, and lower-than-expected inventories of petroleum products also lifted related stocks.Tesoro jumped 7.7 per cent to $27.99 while Exxon Mobil advanced 2.3 per cent to $92.89.
370;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-04-11T00:20:33Z;‘Perfect storm’ looms for copper;;Copper prices traded within $2 of their all-time peak on Thursday amid concerns that the market faces a “perfect storm” for demand and a “perfect nightmare” for supply.The comments by Owen Hegarty, chief executive of Oxiana, the Australian mining company, were delivered at a key copper conference in Chile, where the upbeat mood this week stood in contrast with gloomy forecasts for the world economy published by the International Monetary Fund.Mr Hegarty said copper was set to be a “very big winner” due to strong demand from Asia. His prediction was followed by talk among traders that copper could spike to $10,000 a tonne due to power supply problems in Chile, which produces about 40 per cent of global supplies.Copper prices hit a high of $8,818 a tonne on Thursday, just below the record $8,820 set in March. A drought in Chile has reduced water levels at hydroelectric reservoirs and could limit electricity supplies. Mines in Chile operated by Codelco, the state-owned producer, Anglo American, Antofagasta and Freeport McMoRan, are vulnerable to power supply cuts.Energy in Chile is “a real issue” said Bret Clayton, chief executive of Rio Tinto’s copper business, who pointed out that estimates for future supplies were being overestimated as new mines had to be developed in high risk areas of the world.Kevin Norrish, director of commodities research at Barclays Capital, said there had been huge pressure on global copper supplies due to a lack of high-quality reserves in favourable locations, shortages of skilled labour and huge lead times for essential equipment.“It may be many years before this situation eases,” said Mr Norrish, who also pointed out that a key factor driving copper prices higher had been substantial growth in demand from China and India.This view is shared by Vivek Tulpule, chief economist of Rio Tinto, who has forecast that annual global copper demand growth can be sustained at 4 per cent for at least a decade and possibly a generation.
371;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-04-04T20:46:53Z;Wall St investors brush off weak data;;Wall Street stocks edged higher on Friday, as investors shrugged off weak employment data which reinforced fears that the economy is now in recession, adding to significant gains made earlier in the week.“The market has been able to get its feet under itself this week,” said Richard Sparks, senior equity analyst at Schaeffers Investment Research, thanks in large part to “the absence of bad news from financials, which has been the key factor driving markets down.”“We had a big sell-off with the news of the Bear Stearns rescue, which could have been a catastrophe but wasn’t and stocks were oversold. A bounce back from that is only natural.”“Whether that is the start of something bigger, or just a bear market bounce, is tough to tell right now,” Mr Sparks said, echoing the thoughts of many investors.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.8 per cent higher for the day and was 4.2 per cent ahead for the week at 1,370.40, its best finish since the start of February.Over the week the Nasdaq Composite rose 4.9 per cent to 2,370.98 while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 3.2 per cent to 12,609.42.On Tuesday Wall Street stocks soared on news of capital raising by Lehman Brothers as investors bought back into the sector in hope that it could mark a turning point for the beleaguered financial sector.Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, raised $4bn from a sale of new shares as part of efforts to dispel persistent uncorroborated speculation that it was short of capital.At the same time, Swiss bank UBS said it would take drastic measures to restore its balance sheet after it posted $19bn in writedowns, adding that its chairman would step down.That news helped an index of financial stocks to gain 6.6 per cent over the week, placing them among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500, while an index of investment banking stocks added 9.3 per cent.Lehman shares led the way, rising 16.3 per cent over the week to $44.05. Merrill Lynch added 15.8 per cent to $46.25 and Citigroup jumped 15.6 per cent to $24.08.Those shares were followed up by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered mortgage finance companies that are also seeking to raise capital. Over the week Freddie climbed 8.4 per cent to $27.60 while Fannie added 16.6 per cent to $30.34.Still, analysts remain wary, repeatedly downgrading banks earnings over the course of the week.On Friday Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a brokerage that specializes in financial stocks, predicted that only 19 per cent of banks will post positive operating earnings growth in the first quarter.For much of the week investors looked forward, apprehensively, to the Bureau of Labor Statistics report for March, but when it arrived, showing escalating and unexpectedly severe weakness in the US labour markets, they barely paused.Martin Slaney, head of derivatives at Global Forex Trading, said: “The recessionary trend is there for all to see with worse-than-expected figures, but the market was braced for bad news and seems to be holding up well.”“This certainly ups the odds of another fifty basis point cut at the next Fed meeting so that is providing us with some support.”Those potential cuts tempted investors into the utilities sector with its high dividend yields. Over the week the sector rose 5.1 per cent led by Dynegy, which climbed 6.9 per cent to $8.33.Economists fear that job losses could topple the US economy into a more serious downturn as households cut back on spending, undercutting economic growth.That sentiment hit consumer discretionary stocks on Friday, but over the week as a whole they proved unexpectedly resilient.JC Penney, the clothing retailer that recently surprised the market by slashing its earnings forecasts for the first quarter, bounced 7.2 per cent over the week to $40.18 while Dillards, the department store chain, was among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500, surging 31.7 per cent to $22.03.Markets were also lifted by energy and materials stocks that regained the leadership position they showed earlier in the year as oil pushed towards $106 a barrel and other commodities also rose.Over the week, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gained 11.5 per cent to $107.69 and US Steel added 11.9 per cent to $140.70.The battered housebuilding sector also found momentum.Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist at ING Investment Management, said: “If you take the view that the recession will be short and shallow and that a lot of stimulus is the pipeline and you want to get ahead of the curve, the cyclicals would be a reasonable place to take that position.”The sector ended the week 12.7 per cent higher, led by Pulte Homes, up 12.6 per cent to $15.81, and Lennar, up 20.5 per cent to $21.62.A raft of news, earnings forecasts and analysts recommendations kept technology stocks in focus.Shares in eBay climbed 9 per cent to $32.94 over the week as some analysts noted that positive growth trends during March boded well for the online auctioneer.Meanwhile, semiconductor and other hardware manufacturers received a boost after Asian competitors signaled early Monday that they would raise prices.SanDisk, the flash memory maker, soared 21.5 per cent to $25.84 over the week, while Micron Technology, which makes DRAM memory chips, jumped 23.8 per cent to $6.76.
372;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-04-03T20:47:13Z;Energy and materials stocks lift Wall St;;Wall Street stocks rose slightly on Thursday as investors brushed off worse-than-expected unemployment data and news of rising delinquencies in consumer loans.The number of Americans making claims for unemployment benefits for the first time unexpectedly increased last week while continuing unemployment claims for the previous week rose to the highest since July 2004.That bleak picture was reinforced by an IMF report which noted that the US economy had slowed to a “virtual standstill” and testimony to Congress by Timothy Geithner, President of the New York Fed, who said capital markets are still “substantially impaired”.However, data showing the service sector contracted less than expected in March helped markets pare early losses.And dealers and analysts emphasized that trading was likely to be subdued ahead of Friday’s crucial employment data, which would give a clearer direction to markets.Moderate gains in the materials and energy stocks finally pushed markets into the black just after midday, as they followed commodity prices and analyst estimates higher.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, rose 5.8 per cent to $38.54, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gained 4 per cent to $103.69 and Monsanto added 5 per cent $117.63.Peabody Energy, the coal company, rose 6 per cent to $55.60 while Consol Energy, a coal and gas company, climbed 4.4 per cent to $71.95.Financials also shrugged off a further round of cuts to analysts’ earnings estimates, this time from Lehman Brothers, after John Thain, chief executive of Merrill Lynch, reaffirmed that his securities firm had no need to raise more capital.Merrill bounced 1.2 per cent to $45.89 while the broader S&P 500 financials index added 0.4 per cent.In New York, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,369.31 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent at 2,363.30.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 12,626.03.On Wednesday stocks eased back from an exuberant start to the second quarter after Ben Bernanke’s cautious comments on the economy and a late spike in commodity prices hit equities.Consumers appear to be feeling the squeeze already. According to an American Bankers Association survey they fell behind on a variety of loan repayments at the highest rate in 15 years during the fourth quarter.Consumer discretionary stocks dropped back on the news and were among the day’s biggest fallers. Dillards and Best Buy snapped a three-day winning run, falling 3.2 per cent to $20.40 and 3.2 per cent to $42.53 respectively.Technology stocks helped buoy the market amid a welter of contrasting earnings reports and forecasts.SanDisk leapt after Citigroup analysts said that the stock price of the flash memory maker was approaching a bottom while demand for its products should also improve.Sandisk shares, which have fallen by about half in the last six month, rose 7.5 per cent to $26.47.Micron, the semiconductor maker, posted a bigger second-quarter loss than expected due to a $463m writedown in the value of its memory chip business.The stock climbed 6.3 per cent to $6.79 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the company from “sell” to “neutral”, citing the prospects of improving prices for DRAM computer memory chips.Rival semiconductor manufacturers LSI and Texas Instruments climbed 7.1 per cent to $5.43 and 2 per cent to $30.13 respectively.That news helped offset a downgrade to Cisco, the world’s biggest maker of computer-networking equipment. Cisco shares fell 2.9 per cent to $24.23 after UBS cut its recommendation on the shares to “neutral.”“Our industry checks show orders are slowing which gives us concern about the July quarter,” UBS analysts said.Sun Microsystems dropped 0.1 per cent to $15.95 and Hewlett-Packard fell 0.5 per cent to $46.96.Research In Motion stock found momentum nonetheless, rising 5.9 per cent to $122.58 after the maker of the BlackBerry reported estimate-beating fourth-quarter results.“Confessional” season, when companies report their preliminary earnings forecasts for past quarter, kept pharmaceutical, healthcare and other companies in focus.Earnings upgrades lifted the medical device makers AngioDynamics and ATS Medical. The pair rose 10.8 per cent to $12.80 and 15 per cent to $1.68 respectively.
373;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-04-02T20:51:33Z;Wall St eases back in choppy session;;Wall Street stocks eased back in choppy session on Wednesday as investors took profits after Tuesday’s rally and digested a cautious view of the US economy from the Federal Reserve’s chairman.In testimony before congress Ben Bernanke alternately spooked and soothed, noting that the economy may contract in the first half but saying that it was unlikely that any other investment bank would require a Bear Stearns-like rescue. Still, traders and analysts noted that the market reaction was relatively muted after significant advances a day earlier and before crucial employment data due on Friday.Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets, said: “We had a huge run Tuesday and I think it is a normal to retrace some of the gains we saw.” He added that surging oil prices late in the day had also dented equities.But fuel and commodity concerns were both the villain and the hero of the piece, knocking the broader markets but boosting energy and basic materials stocks.Exxon Mobil rose 1.7 per cent to $88.52 while ConocoPhillips climbed 1.4 per cent to $78.77.Gold producers Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining also rallied, adding 2.2 per cent to $99.73 and 3.3 per cent to $46.25 respectively.In New York the benchmark S&P 500 closed down for the first time in three days, dropping 0.2 per cent to 1,367.53 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent lower at 2,361.40. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 12,608.92.On Tuesday stock markets around the world bounced back from a dismal first quarter on news that several banks had taken further big writedowns on risky assets and were moving to recapitalise.That momentum stalled early on Wednesday during Mr Bernanke’s testimony to Congress on US economic growth and amid a welter of poor economic current and predictive data.The International Monetary Fund slashed its forecasts for growth in the US, adding that there was a 25 per cent chance of a global recession, while the Commerce Department released data showing further weakness in manufacturing.Financials ended down for the day. An index of investment banks fell 0.3 per cent while the broader S&P500 index of financial stocks lost 0.7 per cent. But there were pockets of resilience. Citigroup added 0.8 per cent to $24.02 while Morgan Stanley rose 0.5 per cent to $49.09.Consumer discretionary stocks also found some unexpected impetus, led by department store chain Dillards, after it made a deal with a group of shareholders that would allow it to avoid a proxy fight. Dillards shares, which have lost 38 per cent of their value over the last year, climbed 14.5 per cent, to $21.08. Family Dollar Stores, another retail chain, rose 2.3 per cent to $21.40 while JC Penney gained for a third day – 2 per cent to $40.91.Homebuilders were also boosted after top US Senators agreed on Tuesday to try to pass legislation that could help some homeowners avoid foreclosure. Centex added 0.8 per cent to $26.01, KB Home gained 4 per cent to $28 and DR Horton rose 0.5 per cent to $17.16.Mr Bernanke’s statements also overshadowed better than forecast results from Best Buy and news that private sector jobs increased unexpectedly in March.Best Buy, the consumer electronics and entertainment software retailer, said profits fell 3 per cent to $737m in the fourth quarter.However analysts had been expecting greater declines and revenues proved resilient, climbing 4 per cent to $13.42bn.Best Buy shares rose 1.8 per cent to $44.24, while smaller rival Circuit City, gained 5.7 per cent to $4.65.A report by ADP, the payroll services firm, also cushioned falls after it suggested private sector jobs had climbed in March .But the decline in factory orders hit consumer staple and industrial stocks in spite of some positive news.Caterpillar lost 1.8 per cent to $78.51 despite of announcing that it would increase prices for its machinery by up to 5 per cent, while General Electric dropped 1.1 per cent to $38.02.Walgreen, the retail drugstore chain, fell 2 per cent to $38.14 despite revealing that total sales rose 10.6 per cent to $5.11bn in March, compared to last year.
374;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-03-26T21:07:05Z;US shares fall as recession fears reinforced;;Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday, snapping a three session winning streak after new data suggested the broader US economy faces a downturn and concerns about banks’ earnings weighed on sentiment.Durable goods orders in February unexpectedly dropped 1.7 per cent - and by 2.6 per cent excluding volatile orders for transport equipment - according to the Commerce Department.John Ryding, chief US economist at Bear Stearns, said: ”This weaker than expected report points to declining capital spending in the first quarter, falling orders, and a significant pickup in inventories in relation to sales. This is another report that has a strong recessionary feel about it.”The numbers for machinery orders were notably anaemic and the news hit shares in General Electric and United Technologies.GE fell 0.3 per cent to $37.15 while United Technologies dropped 0.8 per cent to $69.61.The series comes after another batch of economic indicators on Tuesday highlighted plummeting confidence among consumers in the US and further pain in the housing sector.Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman, said: “Now that we have moved past the euphoria about Bear Stearns being bought out and the steps that central banks are taking, we are back to thinking about micro-economics and about consumer confidence and the like.”The benchmark S&P 500 index - which fell as much as 1.2 per cent - closed down 0.9 per cent at 1,341.13 points, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.7 per cent to 2,324.36 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.9 per cent to 12,422.86.Separately, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales in February fell less than expected but still at the slowest sales pace since February 1995.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the data, in addition to other recent reports, suggested home sales could be approaching a bottom but shares in house builders tumbled nonetheless.Centex fell 8 per cent to $23.73 while Lennar lost 6.8 per cent to $17.59.Hovnanian fell 9.4 per cent to $11.05 after Moody’s cuts its rating, citing losses, high debt and a weak macro environment for the economy and for housebuilders.Moody’s said the ratings outlook for the company was negative.The banking sector was also in sharp focus again after Germany’s Deutsche Bank warned that disruptions to revenues and writedowns relating to the global credit crisis could threaten its annual profit targets.On Tuesday a number of banking analysts cut their estimates for the sector, pushing financials into the red.That trend continued after Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney slashed her forecasts for earnings in fiscal 2008 by 84 per cent on average and said further downgrades were likely.Ms Whitney sharply cut her estimates for Citigroup by 309 per cent to reflect possible writedowns of $13.1bn in the first quarter of 2008, on mortgage backed securities and other assets.Citigroup shares fell 5.9 per cent to $22.05 and an index of investment banking shares fell 4.1 per cent.Bank of America, the second-biggest US bank by assets, dropped for a second day, falling 2.8 per cent to $39.84, while Wachovia lost 6.7 per cent to $28.02.Fresh doubts emerged about the Clear Channel takeover. The two private equity firms leading a $19bn buyout of the largest US radio operator are at odds with banks financing the deal, increasing speculation that the deal could collapse.Clear Channel shares plunged 17.3 per cent to $26.93 in morning trading.Technology stocks too were sold off as investors worried about what third quarter results from Oracle, after the close, might contain.Oracle, often seen as a bellwether of the US technology sector, was down 0.7 per cent at $20.94 at the close.Microsoft fell 2 per cent to $28.57 and Novell also dropped 0.6 per cent to $6.52.Commodity-related stocks were the exception to the bearish mood, climbing for a third straight day as oil prices rose and further dollar weakness sustained the recovery in gold, base metals and agricultural commodities after last week’s sell-off.Gold miners Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining added 5.4 per cent to $97.44 and 1.3 per cent to $47.44 respectively.Shares in oil companies rose after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said crude oil will average $92.30 a barrel this year, up 27 percent from last year as declining reserves increase extraction costs.The New York-based investment firm also raised its price targets for related companies including Apache, which was among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500, up 6 per cent to $119.75.But higher oil prices hit airline stocks. American Airlines shares slid 10.6 per cent to $8.61 and Delta shares fell 12.3 per cent to $8.74.
375;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-03-26T20:15:24Z;All eyes on Xstrata as Vale’s resolve falters;;"The failure of the Brazilian mining company Vale’s attempts to take over London-listed Xstrata left both sides feeling wistful on Wednesday. A person close to Xstrata likened the opportunity to when BHP of Australia merged with Billiton of South Africa to form the world’s biggest mining company, and said a Vale-Xstrata combination could have been a similar platform for future growth.But although both companies feel like a great opportunity has passed, in part because of hostile market conditions, Vale and Xstrata were keen to project the message that life will go on and that neither side needed to do the deal.Vale’s shares rose almost 5 per cent on the back of the news, while Xstrata shares closed down 5.2 per cent as the market stripped out most of the stock’s takeover premium.One London-based mining analyst said that Xstrata would quickly get on with pursuing other deals.The Anglo-Swiss group has grown rapidly through acquisition over the past five years, and all eyes will be on Xstrata following the end of talks with Vale.Bankers said Mick Davis, Xstrata chief executive, remained interested in “transformational deals”. But they played down expectations that Xstrata would soon unveil a new deal on the rebound from its break-up with Vale. It is likely that things could go quiet for a while as Xstrata looks at opportunities.Mr Davis has said in the past that he was keen to get into platinum and iron ore, to diversify his group’s portfolio of copper, coal, nickel, zinc and ferrochrome.Analysts speculated that Xstrata could look at buying Impala or Lonmin, the world’s second- and third-largest platinum producers, respectively.But it is understood that while Xstrata likes Impala’s businesses in particular, it thinks the platinum companies are too expensive.As for iron ore, there are very few businesses up for sale and Xstrata would face strong competition in any bid from Chinese state-backed companies, which are aggressively buying up iron ore assets to reduce their reliance on Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton.The big question is whether Xstrata could interest London-listed Anglo American in a deal. It is thought that a combination with Anglo would be top of Mr Davis’s wish list as this would bring exposure to both platinum and iron ore, and there could be some synergies in South Africa and South America.The rise in Xstrata’s share price in recent months means that, even afterWednesday’s share price fall, it is now not much smaller than Anglo, making a merger less of a pipedream than it was 12 months ago. But Anglo has so far been unwilling to talk to Xstrata, and people close to the situation said that had not changed.If Xstrata cannot find another big deal to do, it is likely to restart its share buy-back programme. The group said that further buy-backs were now “certainly an option”.Mr Davis is now likely to be reassessing his future plans in the light of Vale’s bid failure. He has a lot of his personal wealth tied up in Xstrata stock options, and while these start to pay out in May, his incentive package is designed to keep him at Xstrata.A change of control would have triggered a pay-out on all of the options however, and it was likely that he would have left if Vale had taken over.On Vale’s part, the company was keen to stress that its priority was organic growth, and that it had big plans to build new iron ore mines in Brazil.As for acquisitions, the group is likely to wait for the current turmoil to die down. But it remains keen to diversify away from iron ore, and analysts said yesterday that it could take a look at US copper producer
Freeport-McMoRan and also Hydro, the Norwegian aluminium producer."
376;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-03-25T20:55:02Z;Wall Street shrugs off weak economic data;;A rally in commodity-related stocks helped Wall Street to its third session of gains despite new data showing plummeting consumer confidence and further weakness in the housing sector in mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday.Statistics from the Conference Board suggested that consumer confidence in the US fell to its lowest since March 2003, when the Iraq invasion was under way.Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said: “This is very grim news indeed. If sustained at this level, consumer spending should be expected to drop to a year-on-year rate of about minus 2 per cent in the near future, a pace last seen in late 1974, and then only very briefly.“If spending does weaken to that degree, an outright recession will be unavoidable and a severe recession will be very likely. In short, this is one of the most alarming economic reports we have seen in this cycle so far.”The news hit the stocks of retailers such as Sears and Macy’s, which fell 3.4 per cent to $107.82 and 3.1 per cent to $25.52 respectively.But improved earnings forecasts from Monsanto, the agricultural products firm, and a bounce in commodity prices pushed the broader indices to return to positive territory.Monsanto shares were the biggest gainers on the S&P 500 index jumping 9.9 per cent to $114.54 after the company said earnings for the 2008 fiscal year would be stronger than initially suggested.Gold miners Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining climbed after gold rallied and copper advanced for a second day.Freeport-McMoRan rose 4.1 per cent to $92.41, while Newmont climbed 3 per cent to $46.82. Gold miners were heavily sold last week as gold prices tumbled from record highs.Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist at ING Investment Management, said: “There has been a change in sentiment this week. Last week rumours were flying and people were selling everything. Now it seems investors are more discriminating.”The benchmark S&P500 index fell as much as 0.6 per cent after the consumer data was released, but by the close it had recovered and was up 0.2 per cent at 1,352.96 points. The Nasdaq composite index was 0.6 per cent higher at 2,341.05 points.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,532.60.Separate data released Tuesday morning also painted a bleak picture of the housing sector, as prices for existing single-family homes in 20 metropolitan areas in the US showed dramatic year-on-year declines.“Unfortunately it does not look like early 2008 is marking any turnround in the housing market, after the declining year recorded throughout 2007,” said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at Standard & Poor’s. “Home prices continue to fall, decelerate and reach record lows across the nation.”Housebuilders and related companies fell back on the news. DR Horton gave up some of Monday’s gains, dropping 2.7 per cent to $16.25, and Pulte Homes fell 2.8 per cent to $15.05.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, lost 1.7 per cent to $28.76, while rival Lowe’s fell 2.5 per cent to $23.68.One exception was Thornburg Mortgage, the embattled “jumbo” mortgage specialist, whose shares surged after the company said it would raise up to $1.35bn as part of ongoing efforts to stave off bankruptcy.Thornburg shares, which have lost over 90 per cent of their value in the last year, rose 36.4 per cent to $1.73.The new data damped optimism triggered on Monday by numbers showing a surprise increase in existing home sales in February. That news, and a raised offer from JPMorgan for Bear Stearns, had pushed US stocks to their highest close in a month on Monday.However, Bear Stearns shares fell back 2.8 per cent to $10.94 on Tuesday, moving closer to the revised $10-a-share bid price, and JPMorgan dropped 1.1 per cent to $46.06.Financials sold off more broadly amid a welter of analyst downgrades.Bank of America, the second biggest US bank by assets, fell 3.5 per cent to $40.97 after analysts at Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock from “neutral” to “sell”.
377;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-03-20T19:49:11Z;Congo asks for bigger mining share;;The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday published plans for the review of its mining contracts, in a move critics see as an attempt to strong-arm international companies into giving state mining companies greater ownership of their assets.The Kinshasa government published a long-awaited report on the review of the country’s mining contracts, saying companies had made “enormous gains without corresponding benefits to the DRC” and that the contracts needed to reflect the sharp rise in world copper prices.The government of president Joseph Kabila is looking at overhauling 61 different mining contracts, including some signed during Congo’s 1998-2003 civil war in less than transparent circumstances.Companies ranging from major miners like De Beers and Freeport McMoRan to smaller groups like Anvil Mining and First Quantum Minerals could be affected by the move, which is likely to give a bigger role to state-owned copper mining group Gecamines.The report also recommends the cancellation of some contracts awarded to smaller, unlisted companies operating in the violent east of the country.The report by the government-appointed Review Commission was released to the public on Thursday, although the companies involved had been informed of the recommended changes last month.Toronto- and London-listed First Quantum Minerals has been told that its title to its huge copper and cobalt project at Kolwezi in Congo’s southern Katanga province was improperly structured. The Review Commission said the Kolwezi title had been sold off too cheaply and has advised the contract to be redrawn to include ”up-front payments” of cash and a more active role for Gecamines in management.A spokeswoman for First Quantum said on Thursday that it was “in discussions” with the government about the proposed changes, and that the group felt its contract was “fair and legal”.If companies disagree with the Review Commission’s proposed changes, they can appeal to a taskforce of government ministers in Kinshasa, the capital, and submit any fresh data.One of the biggest recommended changes concerns the massive Tenke Fungurume copper project, which is being developed by US copper company Freeport McRoRan. The report recommended renegotiation of Gecamines’ role in the project, and that Gecamines’ stake rises from 17.5 per cent to 45 per cent.A spokesman for Freeport said the group had already responded to the government’s letter about modifications to the Tenke contract, and the company would argue to maintain its existing terms. “Our contract was negotiated transparently, complies with all laws, was approved by the government and we believe the terms are fair and equitable. We will work with the Ministry of Mines to resolve these matters and continue with our project development activities.”Companies including First Quantum have warned the Congo government that they might take their cases to the international courts.
378;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-03-05T22:13:28Z;Wall St gains pared by doubts over Ambac;;US stocks pared early gains on Wednesday after news of a proposed equity offering by Ambac Financial failed to convince investors that it was enough to tackle a capital shortfall at the troubled bond insurer.Surging commodity prices prompted investors to buy the energy and materials sectors ensuring the major indices closed in positive territory.Economic data provided little in the way of support. Although a report on the US services sector was better than expected, this was partly offset by downbeat private sector employment figures and a decline in new factory orders. Meanwhile, two-thirds of the Federal Reserve’s beige book regional survey respondents reported weakening business conditions.The S&P 500 finished the session up 0.5 per cent at 1,333.72, having earlier gained 1.3 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 12,254.99 and the Nasdaq Composite put on 0.6 per cent to 2,272.81.An index of financial stocks retreated for a fifth consecutive session after Ambac said it would sell $1.5bn of stock and other equity instruments to boost its capital levels. Financials had moved higher before the announcement on hopes Ambac would unveil a large capital infusion, possibly from a consortium of banks.Although Standard & Poors and Moody’s Investors Service said the plan would probably suffice to save Ambac’s triple-A ratings the stock fell 18.8 per cent to $8.70 having risen 11 per cent prior its announcement. MBIA, a rival bond insurer, shed 6.2 per cent to $12.18.“I think the market was looking for something bigger and it didn’t get it. In the case of Ambac it has been ‘buy the rumour and sell the news’,” Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said.Concerns about the declining US housing market continued to weigh on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government chartered mortgage lenders, whose shares fell 6.5 per cent to $24.27 and 4.1 per cent to $21.64 respectively. Morgan Stanley said it expected Fannie and Freddie to make a first-quarter loss but added that results in 2009 “should be significantly stronger as guarantee fees continue to rise, helping offset peak losses”.Citigroup, rebounded from Tuesday’s near 10-year low, climbing 0.2 per cent to $22.15, but Bank of America fell 1.6 per cent to $37.55.The gloom in financials was in contrast to exuberant energy and metal producers which rallied as oil hit an all-time high of $104 a barrel and gold and copper gained. An index of S&P 500 energy stocks rose 1.8 per cent.Schlumberger, the largest oilfield services company, rose 3.9 per cent to $87.85. Chevron, the second-biggest oil company in the US, rose 2.4 per cent to $88.79.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the world’s largest publicly traded copper mining company, added 5.2 per cent to $104.08.Technology stocks also closed broadly higher after media reports suggested Yahoo and Time Warner have been holding talks about a possible joint venture involving Time Warner’s struggling AOL internet unit.The move might help Yahoo escape a takeover by Microsoft. Yahoo rose 2.2 per cent to $28.67 and Time Warner rose 0.1 per cent to $15.30.In other deal news Packeteer soared 28 per cent to $4.94 after the network management software maker received a $5.50-a-share buy-out offer from hedge fund Elliot Associates.On the earnings front Semtech, which makes chips for mobile phones and personal computers, rose 5.7 per cent to $13.66 after it said fourth-quarter profit more than tripled, from $4.6m to $$14.9m, and it planned to buy back up to $50m in shares.Costco, the discount retailer, reported a 31 per cent increase in second-quarter profit to $327.9m, in line with analysts’ forecasts. The shares closed 2.5 per cent lower at at $60.83.Big Lots led gains on the S&P 500, jumping 22.2 per cent to $21.23 after the largest US seller of overstocked items said its first-quarter profits would top analyst estimates.BJ’s Wholesale Club rose 6.9 per cent to $35.58 after the warehouse-club retailer said fourth-quarter net income increased more than fourfold, helped by higher January sales.
379;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-02-19T23:14:30Z;US investors unsettled by oil price spike;;"US stocks gave up early gains on Tuesday as equity investors were unsettled by a sudden spike in crude oil prices above $100 a barrel sparking concerns that businesses would be hit with higher costs.Soaring oil prices also raised the spectre of renewed inflationary pressures prior to Wednesday’s consumer price index reading.Although oil producers and miners were buoyed by the jump in raw materials, the run-up in crude hurt the transport, industrial and consumer sectors.US banks also finished in negative territory as confidence was shaken by Credit Suisse’s admission of “pricing errors” and as Standard & Poor’s downgraded $13.8bn in US collateralised debt obligations.The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,348.78, having risen 1.3 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,306.20 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to 12,337.22.“[It was] not a good day from an inflationary standpoint. All the commodities are just screaming, which is obviously inflationary. That doesn’t help the Fed to cut rates,” said Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets.The futures market trimmed limited expectations for a 75bp easing at the Federal Reserve’s March meeting, but continued to price in a 50bp cut.Retail stocks were among the worst affected by rising oil prices in spite of a broadly positive earnings update from Wal-Mart The US’s biggest retailer said net income rose 4 per cent to $4.1bn in the fourth quarter while sales topped $100bn.Wal-Mart said customers were more cautious in January and its current quarter guidance lagged some analysts’ estimates. The shares rose 0.4 per cent to $49.66 but the broader S&P retail index fell 1.4 per cent to 389.15. OfficeMax, added 5.1 per cent to $23.27 after the office supplies retailer reported a better-than-expected earnings.Energy and mining companies were the lone beneficiaries of surging raw materials prices. Among the biggest movers yesterday was Peabody Energy, up 6 per cent at $58.97. Chevron rose 1.5 per cent to $84.83 on its first day as a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.In mining Freeport McMoran Copper & Gold, 5.1 per cent higher at
$97.94, was one of the chief beneficiaries of a spike in gold and copper prices. United States Steel rose 2.7 per cent to $106.87 after UBS upgraded the shares from “neutral” to “buy”.Energy stocks have fared poorly this year, after a bumper performance in 2007, as concerns about margin pressures and a global economic downturn increased. Although some analysts remain bullish on energy, Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, noted a high proportion of earnings misses and said the sector was primed for a sustained period of underperformance.The outlook for US financial firms will also be a key test for US equities in coming weeks. Some analysts have grown more confident that equities will not retest the lows reached in January, but credit markets continue to point to heightened risks.Banks came under pressure yesterday after Credit Suisse took a $2.85bn writedown on its asset-backed investments and said it had found “pricing errors” on its books. The news unsettled analysts who had previously lauded the company for largely avoiding subprime damage.Lehman Brothers, down 2.2 per cent at $53.57, was among the worst performing brokers after the Wall Street Journal said the bank could face losses on its commercial real estate loans portfolio. Bear Stearns fell 3.4 per cent to $80.02.Bond insurers remained a source of market concern as MBIA said Joseph Brown was returning as chairman and chief executive, replacing Gary Dunton, who resigned. The company is scrambling to avoid a potentially debilitating credit downgrade. The shares slipped 4.4 per cent to $11.70.Telecoms companies closed sharply lower after Verizon Wireless unveiled an unlimited calling plan, raising the prospect of renewed price competition in the mobile sector. AT&T fell 5.3 per cent to $35.89.In technology, Yahoo’s shares fell 2.2 per cent to $29.01 after Bill Gates said Microsoft’s $31-a-share bid was a “fair offer”."
380;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2008-01-16T21:45:00Z;Tech stocks lead Wall Street sell-off;;Wall Street stocks retreated again on Wednesday during a volatile session in which Intel’s earnings figures prompted another bout of selling in the technology sector.Materials and energy companies also came under pressure as crude oil briefly dipped below $90 a barrel and traders bet that a weakened US economy would cause demand for commodities to slump.The market was split with financial stocks enjoying a bounce after JPMorgan cheered the investors by avoiding severe subprime-related losses. However, Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, fell sharply after it slashed its dividend to shore up capital reserves.Retail names also rallied as traders went bargain hunting in discount and department store names. Meanwhile, traders also rushed to cover short positions in the beaten-down homebuilder sector.A late sell-off left the S&P 500 down 0.6 per cent at 1,373.20, its lowest close since November 2006. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,394.59 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent to 12,466.16.However the Russell 2000 small-cap index advanced 0.4 per cent to 699.91 but remains 18 per cent below its July peak.Large-cap technology stocks sold off in early trading after Intel‘s quarterly profits lagged Wall Street’s expectations and its fiscal first quarter revenue outlook disappointed analysts. The shares fell 12.4 per cent to $19.88 as brokerages cut price targets on the stock.Expectations of bumper earnings growth made tech a stand-out sector in 2007 but the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 9.7 per cent this year with the PHLX semiconductor sector index down 12.7 per cent.Fourth quarter earnings are expected to hold up well, averaging gains of more than 20 per cent. But Todd Salamone, vice-president of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, warned that the bulls could set the sector up for a fall.He said: “The tech sector is expected to have strong earnings growth so it may have more trouble beating estimates.”BEA Systems was a bright spot, soaring 18.5 per cent to $18.46 after Oracle agreed to buy the business software company for $8.5bn. Oracle’s shares rose 2.9 per cent to $21.92.The financial sector rebounded after JPMorgan’s results revealed much less exposure to subprime damage than some of its rivals. Fourth quarter earnings fell 34 per cent to $2.97bn, worse than expected, as the bank took a $1.3bn writedown on mortgage investments.However JPMorgan’s problems were small compared with the $18.1bn in writedowns that Citigroup revealed on Tuesday. Citi reported a $9.8bn fourth quarter loss and revealed a sharp rise in consumer credit costs. JPMorgan’s shares rose 5.8 per cent to $41.43 but Citi fell 2.6 per cent to $26.24. Merrill Lynch, expected to reveal heavy losses on Thursday, rose 3.9 per cent to $55.09.Also reporting on Wednesday, Wells Fargo, up 3.3 per cent at $27.37, said fourth quarter profit fell 38 per cent, in line with expectations.Shares in Ambac Financialplunged 38.7 per cent to $12.97 after the bond insurer said it would raise $1bn in new capital and slash its dividend to help preserve its triple-A rating. Ambac also said it expects to take a $5.4bn pre-tax writedown for the fourth quarter. MBIA, a rival, fell 16.5 per cent to $13.40.Investors took profits in the agribusiness sector, which escaped the worst of the new year sell-off on hopes that the global food price boom would offset a slowing US economy. Monsanto fell 8.6 per cent to $112.70 and Mosaiclost 9.4 per cent to $91.71.Energy and materials were the worst performing of the S&P 10 leading sectors as traders priced in waning US demand. National Oilwell Varco gave up 6.1 per cent to $64.14 while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold fell 6.6 per cent to $88.63. However falling crude prices were a boon for the struggling transport sector, with truckers and airlines receiving a boost.A comparatively modest increase in consumer price inflation in December, which rose 0.3 per cent compared to expectations of a 0.2 per cent uptick, may leave the door open for the Fed to cut interest rates aggressively, as the futures market now expects.David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley, said: “The Fed is now clearly downplaying the emphasis on inflation while raising their focus on the downside risks”.The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book regional survey showed the US economy continued to grow at the end of last year, but at a slower pace, providing some comfort to investors fearing a recession.
381;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2007-11-18T22:52:33Z;Mining industry digs in for turf war;;BHP Billiton’s attempted takeover of Rio Tinto has set in motion a complicated set of variables that could result in consolidation of the entire mining sector in the next few years.Rio is exploring several possible alternatives to engaging with BHP, after rejecting the $67bn takeover proposal last week on the grounds that it significantly undervalued Rio Tinto and its prospects.The most extreme option would be for Rio to reverse the situation and launch a counterbid for BHP. But because of the difference in market capitalisation of the two mining groups – Rio is capitalised at $152bn, BHP at about $203bn – to make a so-called “PacMan” defence work, Rio would need to team up with rival miners to be big enough.A more feasible option would be for Rio to threaten to tie up with Companhia Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil, which has a market capitalisation of about $170bn.CVRD is understood to be deeply unhappy about the possibility of losing its dominant position as the world’s largest iron ore producer and is trying to find a way of participating in this consolidation round. The Brazilian miner would be particularly keen on having access to Rio’s copper, coal and aluminium assets, although such a union would encounter competition issues in iron ore.If Rio is not interested in such a pairing, CVRD could take control of the situation and team up with either Xstrata or Alcoa and engineer its own break-up of the Anglo-Australian miner. The three groups could then divide Rio’s copper and iron ore assets between them, and Alcoa would get Alcan.If BHP simply raises its offer for Rio and that deal is recommended, CVRD will have to turn its focus elsewhere and look at making a more lateral acquisition, such as for Freeport-McMoRan. Buying Freeport, which spent $26bn to acquire rival Phelps Dodge last year, would help the Brazilian group build its position in base metals.Another possible merger would involve a bid by Xstrata for Anglo-American, which is in the middle of a restructuring that includes the demerger of Mondi, its paper business, and a sale of Tarmac, its construction materials arm.According to the research team at Credit Suisse, if Xstrata offered £42 a share for Anglo, in cash and shares, it could enhance its own earnings by 5 per cent.It could make more sense for Xstrata to launch a bid for Lonmin to build scale in the platinum market. The research team at UBS believes that Lonmin is a possible acquisition target for “anyone believing that long-term platinum prices could be higher than current spot prices”.ArcelorMittal is another powerful player unlikely to sit still during this phase of consolidation. On Wednesday, the steel group said it was keeping a close eye on developments with BHP’s offer.The Chinese, Indians and Russians are also keen to participate in any industry shake-up. Last week, Alexei Mordashov, head of Severstal, said he was interested in buying control of Highland Gold. The Russian steelmaker has already made a bid for Celtic Resources Holdings, but that looks only the beginning of its mergers and acquisitions strategy.Vedanta Resources, India’s largest producer of copper and zinc, has global ambitions. And analysts have also suggested that Norilsk Nickel or Rusal could be interested in Anglo-American.The team at Exane BNP Paribas point out that a state-owned Chinese company, such as Chalco, could look at securing a blocking stake in either BHP or Rio, as a way to maintain some sort of competition in key segments such as iron ore. But it is unclear what stake would be necessary to achieve this, or how the Australian government would react to such a transaction.With the weakness of the US dollar, several smaller American companies could become takeover targets for foreign bidders. The team at Jeffries & Co believes companies that produce raw materials for steel-making, such as metallurgical or coking coal and iron ore, are particularly attractive. Names in the frame include Cleveland Cliffs and Allegheny Technologies.Rio Tinto has also said it is plans to sell Alcan’s packaging business, which is valued at about $5bn. Rio could also sell some of Alcan’s electrical cable businessOnce the credit markets stabilise, private equity could also make an appearance in this consolidation game by picking off non-core assets of which any of the merging companies may be disposing.BHP has denied rumours that was planning to put BHP Petroleum up for sale. But if circumstances change, BHP Petroleum would attract a wide range of bidders, including some of the world’s biggest oil companies such as ExxonMobil and Shell. PetroChina would also join in such an auction.
382;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2007-11-02T01:01:23Z;Coal-rich Jakarta leans on domestic supplies;;Indonesia, the world’s largest exporter of thermal coal, is planning to impose a domestic market obligation (DMO) on coal producers to ensure sufficient supplies for 35 power stations that are due to come on stream in 2009.The move follows attempts to secure cheap domestic supplies through policy intervention in other resource-based industries, notably palm oil and gas, as global prices and demand soar. Jakarta is also seeking to renegotiate contracts with international heavyweights, including Exxon-Mobil and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, to make more money.Foreign executives in the resources sector say the moves are unwelcome but understandable and would be supported if the government could guarantee legislative, contract and price certainty so companies could make long-term investment decisions.Purnomo Yusgiantoro, the energy and mineral resources minister, was quoted by local media on Thursday as saying the government and parliament are now “undertaking the internal co-ordination so as to be able to implement the [DMO] policy”. “It’s necessary to secure future supplies for domestic use,” he said, without indicating what the percentage for the domestic market might be.Officials say the DMO would probably come into effect with the enactment of the long-delayed mining bill expected next month.PLN, the state electricity company, predicts its coal needs will rise from 30m to 70m tonnes to supply the power stations. The Indonesian Coal Society estimates that by 2009 domestic demand will be 103m tonnes, up from 33m this year. Production is expected to be 203m tonnes this year, up from 193m last year, and set to rise to 225m next year.Domestic prices are as much as 20 per cent lower than export prices but officials say the government will not seek to regulate DMO prices.Producers and analysts say a DMO would hit revenue because the traditional model of exporting only better quality coal is changing. “The Chinese and Indians are willing to take almost anything because demand is going crazy,” said Phil Rickard, a Jakarta-based extractive industries expert.But he and others were not overly critical of the broader economic nationalism. “I think it is reasonable that the government wants more,” said an executive at a foreign mining company.“It is just a question of how they arrange it so it does not penalise producers in a low-price environment, or eliminate incentives to put in new capital.”
383;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2007-07-23T10:19:56Z;UK Companies Diary: BHP’s war chest;;●BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest mining company, will publish its latest quarterly results and an update on its pipeline of exploration and development projects. This will give analysts a pretty good idea of what BHP’s annual results, which are due at the end of August, will be like. Attention is likely to be diverted, however, towards the wave of speculation over what BHP Billiton might buy following arch-rival Rio Tinto’s record-breaking $38bn (£18.5bn) bid, excluding debt, for Alcan, the Canadian aluminium group. There had been gossip that BHP would buy Alcoa, Alcan’s US rival, but sources close to BHP have been saying this is unlikely. The rumour-mill has since switched to other possible targets, including Freeport McMoRan, the US copper miner.●After a strong first-half performance by Capita that has seen its shares reach a high of more than 775p, analysts are expecting sales for the first six months of 2007 of about £970m and earnings per share of about 12.6p, which equates to growth of about 15 per cent. The group has had a successful period of contract wins split between insurance, local authorities and retail. More may be announced on Tuesday, reinforcing the group’s market-leading position. The pace of outsourcing appears to be accelerating. Government spending is being squeezed, making local authorities more likely to look for efficiency savings with companies such as Capita, which can typically reduce costs by about 30 per cent. Analysts are also predicting margins to rise to about 14 per cent, assisted by the group’s low-cost Indian operations. Capita has a consensus price-earnings ratio of about 24 times 2008 earnings, well above the sector average. Paul Pindar, chief executive, is thought to be considering a special dividend to return more cash to shareholders. With interest cover of 16 times, the group certainly has the scope for a return of capital.
384;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2007-06-15T20:24:01Z;Nasdaq leads Wall Street gains;;Wall Street rebounded from an interest rate pothole this week and a strong weekly performance left the S&P 500 and blue chips testing record territory once more.After falling by about 1 per cent on Tuesday when long-term bond yields soared to their highest level since 2002, US stock benchmarks subsequently found their footing when rates stabilised. Benign core inflation readings for May reinforced the stabilisation in bonds and also boosted stocks.Tony Crescenzi, bond strategist at Miller Tabak & Co, said the inflation data would “help to restrain any increase in yields, which for the stock market is enough to put worries about the bond market a bit further into the background”.Attention has focused on whether the recent rise in bond yields will damp what has been a frenetic pace of merger and acquisition activity. On Friday, there were signs that deal activity was picking up and Home Depot, up 0.4 per cent at $37.95, received two separate bids for its wholesale supply unit. Among sectors in the vanguard of this week’s rebound was energy, as oil prices hit nine-month highs. Rate-sensitive utility stocks rallied, while higher commodity prices buoyed materials and industrial stocks.However, the rise in yields pushed mortgage rates sharply higher and the home builder and real estate investment trust sectors declined.The leading index this week was the Nasdaq Composite. The technology benchmark rose 1.05 per cent to 2,626.71 on Friday, a rise of 2.1 per cent over the week. Semiconductor stocks rallied 2.8 per cent this week, led by a 11 per cent rise to $24.24 for Intel. The chipmaker was upgraded to a “buy” on Friday by Goldman Sachs.The S&P 500 rose 0.65 per cent to 1,532.91 on Friday, a gain of 1.7 per cent this week. It was up from a low of 1,492.97 on Tuesday and was near its recent closing record of 1,539.18.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 13,639.48 on Friday, a rise of 1.6 per cent this week. The blue chip barometer was just shy of its recent record peak of 13,692. The Dow Transportation Average rose 1.1 per cent this week, taking its gain this year to 13.5 per cent as the sector rebounded from a sharp slide on Tuesday, when it hit its lowest level since mid April.Leading the blue chips this week was General Motors, up 11.8 per cent to $34.66 as investors cheered hopes for a union settlement over Delphi, the car maker’s former parts unit, that would help GM’s restructuring efforts.Ford rose 8.2 per cent to $8.92 this week, after it hired banks to advise on the sale of its Jaguar and Land Rover divisions.Deal talk this week focused on the exchange sector. Shares in Nymex rose 1.7 per cent to $142.12 on Friday, for a gain of 13.5 per cent this week, amid reports that it was seeking to merge with another exchange.The tug of war over CBOT Holdings, between the InterContinental Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange took a couple of twists.The CME and CBOT revised the terms of their merger agreement and will provide a special dividend to all CBOT shareholders. This followed a move by ICE on Tuesday to include a cash component in its bid for the CBOT. Shares in CBOT rose 4.3 per cent to $206.98, CME was up 0.6 per cent at $552.70, while ICE gained 7.8 per cent to $156.98.The S&P steel index fell 4.9 per cent, trimming its gain in 2007 to 27.9 per cent as consolidation talk cooled. Nucor slid 5.4 per cent to $63.02 after the steelmaker warned that its second quarter earnings would be well below analysts’ expectations.A number of stocks either hit record or 52-week highs.Eastman Kodak set a 52-week high of $30.20, and rose 10.3 per cent to $29.31. It said it had created image-sensor technology to allow photography in poor light.Freeport-McMoRan rose to a record high of $84.90 amid higher copper prices and news that the miner will sell some assets. Shares in the company gained 10.8 per cent to $84.42 this week.Apple hit a record high of $127.61 before investors cashed in after the company’s annual Developers Conference in San Francisco passed with no major new product news. The stock fell 3.2 per cent to $120.50.In earnings news, subprime mortgage woes clipped fixed income results at Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs. For the week, Bear was up 1.5 per cent at $150.09, and had pared its 2007 loss to 7.8 per cent. Goldman rose 0.5 per cent to $226.19, taking its gain in 2007 to 13.5 per cent.Lehman posted a 27 per cent rise in second quarter earnings to a record $1.3bn and its stock rose 6.6 per cent to $79.07. Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $88.48 on Friday.Fortress Investment Group slumped 6.5 per cent to $23.47 on Friday, as proposed legislation could raise taxes for the private-equity and hedge fund.Dean Foodsfell 3.5 per cent to $31.23 after it cut earnings estimates for the second quarter.Smith & Wesson reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter profit and sales. The gun maker also raised its full-year profit and sales forecasts.

385;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2007-06-14T20:26:19Z;Wall St rises after benign PPI data;;Wall Street rose on Thursday, with sentiment buoyed by a benign core producer inflation reading for May and relatively steady bond yields.After a sharp rally on Wednesday, stocks opened stronger on Thursday and closed below their highs of the day.The S&P 500 index rose 0.5 per cent to close at 1,522.97. Energy, up 1.9 per cent, was the best performing large industry group in the S&P, followed by telecommunication and technology stocks. Transport stocks also rallied, rebounding from sharp losses earlier in the week.The yield on the 10-year bond was 1 basis point higher at 5.21 per cent, down from a high of 5.24 per cent earlier in the day.Sectors that have been hurt by the recent rise in yields, such as real estate investment trusts and homebuilders, were on the defensive on Thursday. In contrast, the S&P utilities sector rose 0.4 per cent.In the spotlight on Thursday were financials. The sector was weighed down by evidence that subprime mortgages clipped earnings at Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs.Goldman lost 3.4 per cent to $225.75 and it was one of the worst performing stocks in the S&P.Goldman’s second- quarter profits rose 1 per cent year-on-year, beating estimates. The bank’s fixed-income, currencies and commodities division experienced a 24 per cent decline in revenue, due in part to a weaker subprime market.The recent sharp rise in bond yields has not sparked a dramatic change in the corporate credit environment. The still historically low credit risk premia on corporate debt mean that the appetite for buy-outs is unlikely to dim, analysts say. “Private equity can continue to keep making deals and that should put a floor under stocks,” said Mark Kiesal, portfolio manager at Pimco. “You need to see much wider credit spreads before deal activity really slows down.”Technology and blue-chip stocks continued to rally on Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7 per cent to close at 2,599.41, while the Nasdaq 100 rose 0.6 per cent. Semiconductor stocks gained 1 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.5 per cent firmer at 13,553.73, led by General Motors, up 4.7 per cent at $33.60, Exxon Mobil, up 1.7 per cent at $84.77, and Intel, up 2.5 per cent at $23.23. A drag on the Dow was Dupont, off 0.8 per cent at $50.50 and Merck, down 0.9 per cent at $50.23.The broad market was cheered in early trade by news that producer prices, excluding food and energy prices, rose an expected 0.2 per cent last month. For the 12 months ending in May, the core rate was up 1.6 per cent.In spite of that good news, economists said the report on consumer prices due on Friday was a much more important measure. Attention will mainly focus on the core consumer price increase for the past year. Economists at Lehman Brothers expect a reading of 2.3 per cent, down from last year’s peak of 3 per cent.“Concerns about trend inflation have faded a little,” said John Shin, economist at Lehman. “But tight labour and commodity markets, slowing productivity and rising import prices should keep the Federal Reserve on inflation alert.”Other stocks in the news included Colgate-Palmolive, whose shares fell 0.9 per cent to $66.85. The company said fake toothpaste that could have been poisoned had been found in discount stores in four US states.Meanwhile, Eastman Kodak hit a 52-week high of $29.54, and rose 8 per cent to $29.19. The film and camera maker said it had created image-sensor technology to allow photography in poor light.Freeport-McMoRan rose to a record high of $84.86 amid higher copper prices and news that the miner will sell some assets. Shares in the company gained 2.3 per cent at $83.65.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange upped the ante in its battle withIntercontinental Exchange to win control of the Chicago Board of Trade. CME and CBOT Holdings revised the terms of their merger agreement and will provide a special dividend to all CBOT shareholders.

386;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2007-05-17T21:17:45Z;Wall Street retreats after recent bullish run;;Wall Street stocks weakened on Thursday, as investors consolidated the market’s recent run of gains.The S&P 500 dipped 0.1 per cent to close at 1,512.75, putting an attempt at breaking its 2000 record high of 1,527.46 on hold.Energy stocks led the market as oil prices rallied sharply. By contrast, utility stocks languished as Treasury yields continued their recent rise.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were also weaker. Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the central bank did not expect the present problems in the subprime mortgage market to harm the broader economy or the financial system.Standard & Poor’s said yesterday that first-quarter 2007 operating earnings for the S&P 500 increased 8.2 per cent over the first quarter 2006, boosted in part by the weaker dollar.“The stronger-than-expected earnings can be traced back to international sales, that now account for a significant portion of the S&P 500 revenue,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P.Among S&P sectors, materials led with a 16.9 per cent jump in earnings, and financials posted a better-than-expected rise of 12.7 per cent. In contrast, consumer discretionary companies recorded a 5 per cent drop in earnings, mostly due to lower profits from homebuilders and the automobile sector and lower margins from retailers.Against the backdrop of slowing economic growth, weaker housing activity and high petrol prices, the better-than-expected pace of quarterly earnings growth is “about as close to a perfect landing as we could have hoped for”, said Mr Silverblatt.Still, traders have noted recent buying of put options, which provide insurance against the risk of a sharp decline in the S&P in the coming months. The Chicago Board of Trade’s Vix index, a measure of S&P 500 index volatility known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” was a touch firmer yesterday and remains above recent lows.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent lower at 2,539.38. Semiconductor stocks were again lower and the 1 per cent drop in the Philadelphia semiconductor index took its decline so far this week to 2.4 per cent. Micron Technology fell 5.3 per cent to $11.50 after the group said it plans to sell $1.1bn in convertible notes.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to close at 13,476.72, but the blue-chip barometer did rise above the 13,500 threshold for the first time earlier in the day.Blue-chips were boosted in part by Exxon Mobil, which rose to an all-time high of $82.44, before it closed up 0.4 per cent at $81.80. A downgrade for Caterpillar, off 1.5 per cent at $74.84, weighed on the Dow.The S&P railroad index rallied 2.1 per cent, for a gain of 4.5 per cent so far this week following more news that high profile investors had recently purchased stakes in railroad companies.Merger and acquisition activity yesterday was led by Alliance Data Systems. The issuer of private-label credit cards agreed to be acquired in a $7.8bn deal by Blackstone Group. ADS jumped 24.6 per cent to $78.46 and set a 52-week high of $80.30 earlier in the day.AirTran, the discount airline, said it would extend its tender offer for shares in Midwest Airuntil June 8. AirTran said 57 per cent of Midwest shareholders supported its hostile bid for its rival. Shares in AirTran rose 2.8 per cent at $12.12, while Midwest was 3 per cent firmer at $15.55.In other deal news, Acxiom agreed to a $2.24bn buy-out from private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and ValueAct Capital.

Citigroup said the company’s upgraded search engine will boost revenue and the bank reiterated its buy rating on the stock and has a price target of $600 a share.“By our math, Google generates approximately $0.08 for every search on its network. A better search experience = more searches = more revenue,” said Mark Mahaney, US internet analyst at Citigroup. “Google’s successful product innovation is likely to increase its mind share, its market share, and its market cap,” said Mr Mahaney.

In Shanghai copper had fallen 4 per cent, the maximum daily move allowed.Traders remain preoccupied with developments at the giant Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia, where output has been disrupted by protesting workers.The Indonesian government said Grasberg’s open pit mine was running at 20 per cent capacity and the underground mine was operating at 60 per cent capacity.Grasberg, which is operated by Freeport McMoran, is one of the largest copper mines in the world, with annual production of about 530,000 tonnes.Merrill Lynch warned that a correction for copper prices was likely as the slowdown in the US housing market would continue to affect demand, while supply had been relatively unaffected by labour disputes at key mines.But Bloomsbury Mineral Economics said buoyant industrial activity and the approaching peak for seasonal demand could push copper beyond last year’s record price of $8,590 a tonne.“Longer term, it is possible to envisage market conditions like today’s continuing for another two years – or longer if project delays continue,” said Peter Hollands, of Bloomsbury.Tin fell 1.8 per cent to $13,450 a tonne after a sharp fall the previous session on expectations that the supply situation from Indonesia was set to improve.Oil prices were choppy amid renewed concerns over Iran’s nuclear ambitions and Wednesday’s news of larger-than-expected declines in US petrol inventories.ICE June Brent gained 23 cents at $66.27 a barrel while Nymex May West Texas Intermediate contract, due to expire Friday, fell $1.37 to $61.76 a barrel and June WTI slipped 80 cents lower to $63.58.Enbridge has restarted production at reduced pressure on a pipeline carrying crude from Canada to the Midwest in the US while further test are carried out.Platinum hit $1,300 a troy ounce after ETF Securities announced plans for five physically backed precious metals funds with trading due to start in London on April 24.

Last year, the government in Indonesia shut down a large number of independent smelters operating on the tin-producing island of Bangka and it has approved only two export permits since then.Copper raced 4.5 per cent higher to $8,080 a tonne amid concern that output could be disrupted at the giant Grasberg mine in Indonesia, which is operated by Freeport McMoran. Disgruntled workers were planning to hold a protest rally on Wednesday, demanding fairer career opportunities and better pensions. Grasberg is estimated to contain the world’s third largest copper reserves and huge gold reserves and is expected to produce 499,000 tonnes of copper this year.Nickel jumped 4.5 per cent to $48,300 a tonne as support for sentiment continued to come from low inventory levels with just 2,658 tonnes available to the market, less than one-day of global consumption.Aluminium rose 2.5 per cent to $2,892.5 a tonne while zinc leapt 5.9 per cent higher to $3,707.5 a tonne, helped by a fall of 950 tonnes in London Metal Exchange stocks.Oil prices were volatile on Tuesday after news of a leak in a Canadian pipeline that supplies the US. The leak, on Sunday night, disrupted supplies to the US mid-West. The pipeline has a capacity of 450,000 barrels a day and is operated by Enbridge, a Canadian company. It declined to say how long disruption would last but said the pipeline was still pumping oil from terminals south of the leak.Nymex May West Texas Intermediate added 41 cents at $64.02 a barrel but futures prices from June onwards moved lower.Nymex June WTI traded 33 cents lower at $65.34 a barrel, which suggests traders do not expect supply disruption to last long.ICE June Brent fell 47 cents to $67.78 a barrel after reports on Monday that Royal Dutch Shell would resume production by the end of the month at its 380,000b/d Forcados oilfield in Nigeria, which has been closed since February 2006.Militants in the Niger Delta have disrupted oil production in Nigeria, the world’s eighth largest exporter.Violence erupted again at the weekend during state elections in the run-up to the presidential vote on April 21 amid allegations of voting rigging.Gold edged 0.3 per cent lower to $688.50 a troy ounce.

389;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

Shares in ATMI and RF Micro fell 6.8 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively to $30.68 and $6.31.The S&P 500 dipped into negative territory amid heightened tension between Iran and the UK over the fate of 15 captured sailors. The index bounced back in late trade to close 0.4 per cent higher at 1,422.53.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 at 12,348.75. The Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,417.88.“The economic news was encouraging. Considering the rise in oil prices we have had a pretty good day,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.The $67.50-a-share offer from US Steel for Lone Star Technologies represented a 39 per cent premium to Lone Star’s closing share price on Wednesday.Shares in Lone Star jumped 36.5 per cent to $66.11 while US Steel was 3.7 per cent higher at $101.22.Takeover speculation lifted other shares in the steel sector. IPSCO jumped 10.3 per cent to $130.41, a record high, on rumours of a potential approach. Steel Dynamics rose 4.8 per cent to $42.70.Rising oil prices helped Exxon climb 0.9 per cent to $76.24 while Chevron was 1.2 per cent higher at $74.95.Shares in TXU eased 0.9 per cent to $64.36 after Texas regulators recommended that the utility pay $210m for allegedly manipulating the state’s electricity market two years ago.The Texas Public Utility Commission’s unexpectedly tough recommendation is a sign of rising regulatory interest in the proposed $32bn takeover of TXU by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG, the private equity groups. The utility has faced criticism for strong profit growth amid high electricity prices in Texas.Citigroup gained 0.9 per cent to $51.40. Speculation that it might bid for ABN Amro was quashed after Barclays said it had appointed Citi to advise on its own efforts to buy the Dutch bank.In earnings news, Nabors Industries fell 1.7 per cent to $29.93 after the land-based oil and gas drilling group said its first quarter earnings would miss forecasts because of weak US demand.
391;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2007-01-03T13:56:41Z;Transparency fears lead to review of Congo contracts;;"The Democratic Republic of Congo is set to review three of its biggest mining contracts after a World Bank report found they were approved with “a complete lack of transparency”.The three contracts refer to deals approved in 2005 under a power-sharing government, which was seen by western diplomats as deeply corrupt, but necessary to put an end to war in a country central to the region’s stability. In spite of the reviews, no substantial changes are expected to the contracts.The deals are joint ventures between Gecamines, the bankrupt state-owned copper mining company, and three western mining companies. One involved Phelps Dodge, the global mining giant that recently agreed to be bought by Freeport McMoran to create the world’s largest publicly traded copper company. The two others were with Global Enterprises Company and Kinross-Forrest, which both have strong political connections in Congo.Analysts say the deals account for 75 percent of Gecamines’ mineral asset base.The companies are expected to invest billions in the country during the coming years, but western non-government organisation’s and some diplomats have voiced concern that Congo, one of the most mineral-rich countries in the world, is not getting a good deal for the lucrative concessions. Phelps Dodge has described its Tenke Fungureme concession as one of the world’s largest sources of copper.Analysts say the mining concessions could become a bone of contention in the fragile new government of President Joseph Kabila, who steered the power-sharing government through elections last November. Mr Kabila has allies from his political stronghold in the copper mining province of Katanga installed on the board of Gecamines.In a World Bank memo seen by the Financial Times and dated September 2005, Craig Andrews, the World Bank’s principal mining specialist, wrote to Pedro Alba, the bank’s country director for Congo, to say the deals had not undergone a “thorough analysis, appraisal and evaluation” before being approved. He said the assets transferred to the companies exceeded the “norms for rational and highest use of the mineral assets”.The World Bank, which has taken a prominent role in helping Congo reform its mining sector, could be seen as risking “perceived complicity and/or tacit approval” of the deals, he wrote.Paul Fortin, heading a consultancy brought in by the World Bank to manage Gecamines, told the FT in November he would recommend reviewing the contracts in a way that could benefit Gecamines. But he said he did not expect to change them wholesale, in spite of concerns raised in the September 2005 memo.“If the review is done in such a way that you have to review everything then you are taking a step backwards. You have to deal with the cards you have been dealt,” he said.Gecamines was used as the personal cash cow of Mobutu Sese Soko, Congo’s former dictator, during his 32-year rule of the country. Mineral resources, one of the only sources of government revenue left in Congo, were also used to fund private armies during Congo’s 1996-2002 wars, and helped empower many of those in Congo who exercise the most power today.Mr Fortin’s consultancy had been blocked by the government from taking over at the helm of Gecamines during the period when the three contracts were approved in 2005, and Mr Kabila’s allies on the Gecamines board can still exercise veto powers on any recommendations made by Mr Fortin.The power-sharing government in 2006 also buried a parliamentary commission report, headed by Christophe Lutundula, which was mandated to analyse mining deals signed away during Congo’s war. The panel – headed by Mr Lutundula, who ended up campaigning for Mr Kabila’s political coalition – had recommended that no new mining deals be signed until after a newly elected government was sworn in.Tricia Feeney, a director at Rights and Accountability in Development, a group that has monitored reform in Congo’s mining sector, said the prospects for reform were slight. “Those now in control of the process are the very same people who nodded through some of the most controversial deals of the last three years,” she said.Both Phelps Dodge and Freeport McMoran did not respond to requests for
an interview by the FT.Kinross-Forrest, now part of Katanga Mining Company, which is listed on the Toronto stock exchange, said it did not agree with the bank’s memo. “We consider that the persons from the World Bank accusing this contract of a lack of transparency are definitely not well informed about the contract itself,” a spokesman said.Nikanor, which is the company holding GEC, said it had commissioned an independent auditor to review its contract with Gecamines. It said the auditor had found no evidence of financial impropriety and that the contract was fair."

As oil nudged $80 a barrel and the Fed was seemingly set for further rate hikes, the S&P 500 index was down 2 per cent from the start of the year, while the Nasdaq Composite was
8 per cent lower.“The year really came down to how you reacted once the market made its lows in July,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading. “If you thought the Federal Reserve still had room to tighten policy you lost. Investors who bet the Fed was done, were winners.”The subsequent rally in shares as oil prices receded propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average into record territory and the S&P back to levels not seen since late 2000. Stocks also benefited from lower long-term interest rates, better than expected third-quarter earnings of 19 per cent and a record $176,000bn in merger and acquisition activity.Still, 2006 contained its share of good and bad stock selections. “Every year is the the year of the stock picker,” said Stuart Schweitzer, a global fund manager at JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management.As the year ebbed on Friday, the Dow had gained 16.3 per cent to 12,463.15. That was just shy of its record close of 12,510.57 and its intra-day record high of 12,529.88 set this week.The S&P had gained 13.6 per cent to 1,418.30 this year. All 10 big industry groups in the S&P rose by at least 5 per cent, led by a 32.1 per cent rise in the telecommunications sub-index. Energy followed with a rise of 22.2 per cent, but healthcare and information technology lagged behind with gains of 5.8 and 7.7 per cent respectively. The Nasdaq had risen 9.5 per cent to 2,415.29 for the year at the close of trading on Friday. Some big tech names such as Yahoo, down 34.8 per cent at $25.54 and Ebay, off 30.4 per cent at $30.07, endured a tough year.Leading the pack was the Russell 2000 index of small capitalised companies with a return of 17 per cent.General Motors led the Dow’s charge off its mid-year low of 10,706.14. In spite of facing significant hurdles in restructuring its car operations, its stock rallied 58.2 per cent to $30.72, and set a high of $36.56 in October.That performance paled however, when compared with Allegheny as the manufacturer of stainless steel and titanium rose 151.3 per cent to $90.68 for the year. The laggard in the Dow was Intel. The chipmaker fell 18.9 per cent this year to $20.25, as it endured falling revenues and market share amid a price war with rival chipmaker, AMD, whose stock slumped 33.5 per cent to $20.35 this year. The Philadelphia stock exchange semiconductor index fell 2.4 per cent this year.Other Dow stocks ending the year in negative territory were Home Depot, down 0.8 per cent at $40.16 and Wal-Mart, off 1.3 per cent at $46.18.Boosting the Dow were Hewlett-Packard, up 44 per cent at $41.19, and Disney, 43 per cent higher at $34.27.AT&T, rose 46 per cent to $35.75, and the telecom company led the surge in merger activity with its purchase of BellSouth. The value of the deal has risen from $67bn to about $84bn and is pending approval from regulators. BellSouth has risen 74 per cent to $47.11.Another big deal was Freeport McMoRan’s $25.9bn purchase of Phelps Dodge that would create the world’s largest copper miner. Shares in Phelps jumped 66.4 per cent to $119.17 for the year.While 16 of the Dow’s 30 members failed to beat the overall market’s rise in 2006, Citigroup, with a gain of 14.8 per cent to $55.70, made a valiant effort late in the year, jumping 12.3 per cent in December as investors chased a year-end rally.A record year in earnings for investment banks was reflected in a 56 per cent rise in Goldman Sachs to $199.35.Search engine Google soared above $500 during the year and had rallied 11 per cent to $460.48 on Friday.One of the biggest companies caught in the backdated options morass was Apple.

393;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-12-26T21:49:58Z;US stocks rally in thin holiday trade;;US stocks rallied on Tuesday, as lower oil prices helped offset weakness in retailers amid reports that holiday sales had fallen short of expectations.The majority of gains arrived during the last hour of trading, with volumes at the New York Stock Exchange the lowest seen this year, as stocks enjoyed a rebound after last week’s broad losses.Analysts expect window dressing in stocks could dictate moves this week, as investors purchase those that have experienced solid gains this year in order to embellish their portfolios. This is seen outweighing sales of poor performing stocks, made by investors to lock in a tax loss for their 2006 tax returns.The S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent, or 61.4 points to 1,416.90, on Tuesday. All 10 major groups in the index settled higher, led by the Materials and Financials sectors, while the energy sector reversed weakness seen earlier during the day as oil prices slid.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent, or 12.33 points to 2413.51.

The figures were adjusted for the fact that the holiday shopping season was one day longer than last year. Without the adjustment, sales grew 6.6 per cent in 2006, compared with growth of 8.7 per cent in 2005.The S&P 500 retail index was 0.2 per cent lower at 496.89, after hitting a low of 493.86 for the day in early trade.The S&P Department stores index closed 1.2 per cent lower at 262.81.Shares in JC Penney fell 2.3 per cent at $77.74, Kohls was down 01.3 per cent at $68.89 and Federated Department stores slid 0.9 per cent to $37.76.

Wal-Mart rose 1.2 per cent to $46.11In the internet shopping space, shares in Amazon were 1.1 per cent lower at $39.80, despite experiencing its best holiday sales season in history according to company officials. Meanwhile, eBay’ shares rose 0.3 per cent to $30.32, down from an earlier rise to $30.63.Staying with technology, shares in Microsoft had rebounded from earlier weakness and rallied 1.2 per cent to $29.99. The stock price was buffeted by reports that its latest computer operating system, Windows Vista, has potentially serious security flaws.Shares in Savvis gained 2 per cent to $35.92, after the information technology company sold a business unit to Level 3 Communications for $135m. Shares in Level 3 were down 1.2 per cent at $5.59.Shares in Telik plunged 70.7 per cent to $4.77, after thedrug developer said its Telcyta drug did not show asignificant improvement in survival rates for lung cancer patients.In deal news, CPAC said it had agreed to a $42.8m private buy-out. Shares in the maker of consumer and industrial products rose 7.6 percent, to $8.45.Meanwhile, the US Federal Trade Commission announced they had approved Freeport McMoRan’s plan to buy Phelps Dodge in a $25.9bn deal and create the world’s largest copper miner.

394;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-12-18T00:23:23Z;Bucyrus to buy German rival;;Bucyrus International, a US mining equipment group, has agreed to buy DBT, a German rival, for $731m mostly in cash, as consolidation in the mining industry extends to some suppliers.DBT is a unit for RAG Coal International, which has been shedding assets in preparation for an initial public offering. Bucyrus has agreed to pay $710m in cash and issue shares worth $21m to RAG, in a complex two-part transaction that involves the creation of a holding company through a partnership with the Hamburg Trust, a private investor.The deal will combine Bucyrus’s strengths in manufacturing draglines, electric rope mining shovels and drills for surface mining with DBT’s production of instruments for underground coal mining.The acquisition of DBT will not only enhance Bucyrus’s product offerings by allowing it to move into underground mining, but also help it expand geographically into markets such as China, Russia and India.High commodity prices have sparked a wave of consolidation in the global mining industry. Last month, Phelps Dodge agreed to be taken over in a $26bn deal by Freeport-McMoRan to create the world’s largest publicly-listed copper mining group. That deal came on the heels of the acquisition of Inco, the Canadian mining group, by Brazil’s CVRD and Falconbridge’s sale to Xstrata.The dealmaking activity has put pressure on suppliers and service providers to also seek to consolidate. The same trend is occurring in the oil industry, where many bankers are expecting 2007 to be the year of consolidation among the suppliers and service providers that count the oil majors as their clients.Based in Wisconsin, Bucyrus has a market capitalisation of $1.35bn. On Friday, its Nasdaq-listed shares fell slightly to close at $42.73.Lehman Brothers advised on the transaction and arranged the financing.

396;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-12-11T20:08:34Z;SAC to campaign against Phelps sale;;SAC Capital, the US hedge fund group, on Monday launched an activist campaign against the management of Phelps Dodge, potentially throwing a wrench into the mining company’s plans to be taken over for $26bn by rival Freeport-McMoRan.In a regulatory filing, SAC disclosed it had taken a 5.1 per cent stake in Phelps, worth about $1.25bn, with the intention of voting against the sale to Freeport, which would create the world’s largest listed copper mining group.The group, which is based in Connecticut and run by renowned hedge fund manager Steven Cohen, said the deal would not provide “full and fair value” to Phelps investors and offered “few, if any, synergies to the combined operation”.SAC has historically been a powerful behind-the-scenes trading force on Wall Street. But this is not Mr Cohen’s first foray into shareholder activism. Last year, SAC threw its stake in Time Warner behind investor Carl Icahn’s fight against the company’s management.SAC is also one of a number of prominent hedge funds named in a $6bn lawsuit filed by Canadian insurer Fairfax Financial alleging an activist campaign of dirty tricks against the company. SAC vigorously denies those charges and is fighting the lawsuit.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal in September, Mr Cohen said the days of earning big returns with SAC’s traditional quick trading strategy were over.However, SAC’s Phelps Dodge filing shows Mr Cohen is still a very active trader. The document shows SAC was buying and selling tens of thousands of Phelps Dodge shares on a daily basis in the weeks before the deal was announced. Following the announcement, SAC began buying large blocks of Phelps Dodge options.Phelps management, led by Steve Whisler, chief executive, has already withstood a campaign by activist investors this year. For several months, New York-based Atticus Capital, run by Timothy Barakett, put pressure on the company to sell itself. Phelps was initially trying to push forward a radically different strategy, involving a $40bn twin bid for Canadian miners Inco and Falconbridge, but decided to pursue a sale instead.Phelps shares were up 0.2 per cent to $123.89 in early trading. Freeport was up 0.15 per cent to $61.90.
397;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-12-11T20:02:18Z;Corus takeover;;Monday mornings, long depressing, are turning vicious. Shareholders of Corus will not care, having now received two offers for the Anglo-Dutch steel producer in less than 24 hours. Tata Steel of India bumped up its own bid by 10 per cent to 500p a share on Sunday. On Monday Companhia Siderurgica Nacional of Brazil lobbed in a new recommended offer at 515p. The timing is not the only aspect that links the battle for Corus with other recent Monday specials, such as Freeport McMoRan’s bid for fellow copper miner Phelps Dodge. It is a leveraged buy-out battle redolent of peak market conditions. CSN’s offer puts an enterprise value of £5.9bn ($11.6bn) on Corus, equivalent to 7.6 times 2006 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Deduct annual synergies of $300m, taxed and capitalised at 10 times, and that multiple falls to 6.4 – still a premium to Corus’ European peers.Already, Corus shares have raced ahead to 527¼p in anticipation of a higher counter-offer. Like CSN, Tata wants to integrate Corus’ European plants with its own steel production and iron ore resources back home. CSN’s ability to start shipping lower-cost raw materials to Corus’ plants immediately gives it an operational edge. But at this stage, the level at which the battle might end has more to do with firepower. Both bidders are backed by global banking’s big guns, as well as wealthy family shareholders.The other important aspect of the battle for Corus is that both bidders are emerging markets producers tapping today’s forgiving debt markets in order to vault themselves into a global position. That is a theme likely to continue – look at Russia’s ambitious, cash-rich, closely-held natural resources groups. It has been happening for years in the market for oil and gas assets. As observed there, expect more “strategic” deals, with big acquisition premiums to match.
398;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-12-11T19:33:38Z;SAC Capital/Phelps;;Does SAC now stand for Steven Activist Cohen? The hedge fund manager, famous for huge returns from quick-fire trading, recently told the Wall Street Journal that the days of that approach were numbered. On the face of it, SAC’s aggressive stance on Phelps Dodge is a test case for his new strategy of making bigger bets and holding them longer.SAC says it plans to vote against Freeport’s takeover of rival copper producer Phelps – using the 5.1 per cent stake (largely in options) it has built since the deal was announced. However, the idea that SAC is gearing for war should be taken with a pinch of salt. Given that no other bidder has emerged for Phelps during many months of vulnerability, scuppering the deal would be a huge risk. Phelps’ shares would presumably plunge. Other shareholders would be unlikely to take such a gamble.More likely, Mr Cohen is making a reasonable bet. If the deal goes through on current terms early next year, he stands to make a nice return as the spread closes. Phelps currently trades about 4 per cent below the value of the offer, but the gap has been significantly higher.There is the added chance that, in today’s exuberant debt and metals markets, Freeport could feasibly be pushed higher. Freeport is certainly keen to reduce its huge exposure to politically-risky Indonesia, but it has a pretty good hand unless another suitor for Phelps emerges.SAC’s biggest risk may be that somebody else scuppers the deal by bidding for Freeport. Mr Cohen has shown with Time Warner he is willing to hold a stock for many months. But he is playing a new game. If Freeport disappeared and Phelps’ shares tumbled, it really might require a long-term, active commitment to get back near Monday’s price.
399;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-12-07T19:52:54Z;Antofagasta;;"What on earth is going on with Antofagasta? Shares in the London-
listed Chilean copper miner have been volatile this year. Having reached 509p in May, they fell sharply and hit 359p by mid-June. Since then, however, they have risen by 50 per cent. In dollar terms, the currency in which Antofagasta reports, they are up by 60 per cent.There are few obvious catalysts for a rebound of this magnitude. The price of copper, which accounts for four-fifths of the company’s sales, has risen by 6 per cent in that time. Most analysts expect copper to stay flat or weaken slightly next year.Antofagasta’s fall in June was overdone, so part of the rebound is a reaction to that. At least some of its resurgence, however, is undoubtedly down to merger speculation. Freeport McMoRan’s recent offer for Phelps Dodge, predicated on creating the world’s largest listed copper miner, has reawakened consolidation fever. Freeport is using cheap debt and Phelps’s own balance sheet to help fund the deal. Antofagasta has an estimated $1.2bn of net cash on its books – equivalent to 12 per cent of its current market capitalisation – and is expected to generate $3bn of free cash flow over the next two years.It has world-class, low-cost assets that any number of miners would love to own.The snag with the takeover story is the Luksic family’s 65 per cent shareholding. They have given no indication that they wish to sell out, although they may be open to some dilution if the right deal came along. Swapping some control to make Antofagasta part of a bigger, more diversified group might make sense at this point in the commodities cycle. Investors should be cautious, however. The other effect of the Luksics’ control is Antofagasta’s limited free float, making the share price more sensitive to speculative trading."
400;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Small fry stir corporate waters;;Chief executives are increasingly inclined to plot bids for companies that are far bigger than their own, thanks to the availability of cheap debt and creative structures devised by investment banks.In recent weeks smaller companies in several sectors, surprising many investors with their audacity, have made bids for larger rivals that they could not have pursued in earlier times.The moves, mainly made in the US, highlight how the world of debt-fuelled dealmaking has expanded from its traditional practitioners in the private equity industry.Now it also includes publicly traded companies with aggressive mergers and acquisitions strategies.Last week Penn National Gaming, a casino and racetrack owner worth $3.3bn in market value and $1.4bn in annual revenues, entered discussions to buy Harrah’s Entertainment, the largest US casino operator, with a market value of $14.7bn.The move by Penn came on the heels of Freeport-McMoRan’s $26bn deal to buy Phelps Dodge and create the world’s largest publicly traded copper miner. Freeport is not even half the size of Phelps.November also saw US Airways, which has a market value of $5bn, make an $8bn bid to take over rival Delta Air Lines, which is still in bankruptcy.Outside the US, Corus, the UK steel group, is being courted by two smaller rivals in terms of production – Tata Steel of India and CSN of Brazil.Investment banks are fuelling these more audacious bids by writing the same big financing cheques with generous lending terms to corporate clients that they have been offering private equity firms in recent years.Participating in Penn’s talks to buy Harrah’s are hedge fund DE Shaw as well as Lehman Brothers and Wachovia, which could help finance the deal and provide some of the equity.JPMorgan is funding Freeport’s takeover of Phelps with an $18bn financing package, while Citigroup is backing US Airways in its hostile bid for Delta.Jim Morphy, an M&A partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, the New York corporate law firm, says the “aspirational level” of deals has increased with the increase in funding sources.But he warns: “It’s still tough for the minnow to swallow the whale, especially if the minnow is a public company.“The strategic benefits have to be weighed against the combined debt load in a way that benefits the minnow’s stockholders.”
401;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-11-29T01:38:44Z;Penn National in audacious bid for Harrah’s;;Penn National Gaming is plotting an audacious bid worth more than $15bn to buy its much larger rival Harrah’s Entertainment, potentially igniting a takeover battle for the US casino group.Since early October, Harrah’s has been in talks to be acquired by private equity groups Texas Pacific and Apollo Management, but the negotiations have failed to generate a deal because of disagreements over price.According to people familiar with the matter, that impasse opened the window for Penn, which has a market capitalisation of $3.2bn, to consider its own cash-and-stock offer.In order to make a credible proposal, Penn has lined up a number of financing and investment partners on Wall Street, including DE Shaw, a hedge fund group, and banks Lehman Brothers and Wachovia, insiders said.Penn’s plan highlights the extent to which the availability of cheap debt to finance deals is allowing companies to aggressively pursue acquisitions of larger rivals that previously might have not have been within their reach. This month, Freeport-McMoRan agreed to pay $26bn for Phelps Dodge, a mining group twice its size in market capitalisation.However, a bid by Penn for Harrah’s would still be fraught with complications. The company would add to its already significant debtload of $2.7bn, and the take-over would probably dilute Penn’s earnings, at least in the short term.In addition, Penn would need to obtain regulatory approval from state gaming authorities in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, where the company has no casinos. Apollo and Texas Pacific will face a similar level of scrutiny.Last year, Penn, which owns both casinos and racetracks, expanded significantly when it agreed to buy Argosy, an operator of gaming assets in the MidWest, for $2.2bn.Yesterday, shares in Penn fell 1.5 per cent to $38.16 after CNBC reported its interest in making an offer for Harrah’s. Meanwhile, Harrah’s shares rose 2.5 per cent to $78.46.Harrah’s owns some of the most luxurious casinos in Las Vegas, including Caesars Palace, which it added to its portfolio of mid-market casinos in 2004 when it acquired Caesars Entertainment in a $9.4bn deal. Although real estate and hotel companies have often been targeted by private equity, large gambling groups are a relatively new area of interest for the buy-out industry.The involvement of DE Shaw, Lehman and Wachovia in the bid by Penn demonstrates how a wide range of Wall Street firms are seeking to take advantage of the private equity boom.Penn and Wachovia did not return calls seeking comment. DE Shaw and Lehman declined to comment.Additional reporting by Ben White in New York
402;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-11-24T18:51:52Z;Oil firms while nickel reaches new record;;Platinum and nickel hit record highs this week as weakness in the dollar provided a boost across the metals markets. However, both energy and metals were beset by thin trading conditions in the final trading sessions of the week as many US dealers left their desks for the Thanksgiving holiday.Nickel rose 12 per cent over the week to end at a record $33,500 a tonne, as London Metal Exchange stocks fell to critically low levels with only 4,800 tonnes available to the market.Zinc continued its strong run, gaining 12.2 per cent to $4,515 a tonne over the week. Zinc prices have risen by more than 130 per cent this year as stocks have shrunk to their lowest levels since 1991 at just 87,925 tonnes. Friday’s high of $4,545 brought zinc within striking distance of its record $4,570 reached earlier this month.Dealers described the European market as “almost starved” of zinc, which is being reflected in the rising premiums consumers are prepared to pay over cash prices in order to ensure delivery. That premium is up from $120 per tonne at the start of the year to $320 to $360 a tonne currently.Sentiment towards copper was boosted by news of the Freeport-McMoRan bid to acquire Phelps Dodge in a deal that would create the world’s largest listed copper company.“It is clear that Freeport is banking on the fact that it is not doing this deal just as the copper price is about to burst,” said Robin Bhar of UBS.Copper prices have been under pressure from a large rise in LME inventories since October. But in spite of a 2,525-tonne stock increase in LME stocks yesterday, three-month copper rose 5.2 per cent to $7,155 a tonne this week. Chinese demand for copper is showing signs of strengthening, and the absence of sales by the State Reserve Bureau is tightening the market. Copper inventories in Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses are at their lowest level in 17 months.Aluminium rose 3.6 per cent to $2,720.5 a tonne this week following the recent announcement from China that export taxes will be raised from 5 to 15 per cent.Disruptions to exports from Alaska due to bad weather provided support for oil prices until the Energy Information Administration announced a larger-than-expected increase in US crude stocks of 5.1m barrels on Wednesday.ICE January Brent rose 72 cents to $60.07 a barrel yesterday, up 1.8 per cent this week. Nymex January West Texas Intermediate added 66 cents at $59.90 a barrel yesterday. WTI’s rise of 7.3 per cent this week was exaggerated by extreme weakness in the expiry of the previous front month contract last Friday.Members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries provided mixed signals over whether the cartel would agree to a further production cut in December. Dealers are still assessing conflicting tanker tracking data to judge if the cartel’s members are complying fully with the 1.2m barrels a day cut agreed for November.Dollar weakness supported gold, up 2.7 per cent this week to $638.50 a troy ounce. Silver bettered gold’s gains, rising 4.8 per cent to $13.39 a troy ounce.Platinum was unchanged at $1,185 a troy ounce this week, although it hit a record $1,395 a troy ounce in volatile trade on Tuesday, boosted by rumours that a new exchange traded fund was to be launched. Gold and silver ETFs have generated a new wave of investor interest that hedge funds believe would be mirrored by platinum.However, stocks of platinum have been depleted, and some traders think the market is already too tight to support an ETF. There are also fears that platinum prices could be seriously distorted if an ETF is backed with physical purchases. Jewellery demand is falling due to high prices, and autocatalyst manufacturers are thought likely to object to an ETF given platinum’s vital role in ensuring compliance with ever tighter emissions standards.

The economic background is supportive and private equity deals are helping maintain a bid for the market,” said Scott Wren, equity strategist at AG Edwards.Among proposed deals of more than $50bn this week, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold said it would acquire Phelps Dodge in a $25.9bn cash and stock transaction, to make the world’s largest publicly traded copper group. Shares in Phelps soared to a high of $123.96 and gained 28.7 per cent to $122.27 for the week.

The BBG real estate investment trust index rallied 5.8 per cent this week.Russia’s Evraz Group signalled consolidation in the US steel sector by announcing the purchase of Oregon Steel Mills in a $2.3bn deal. Shares in Oregon hit a high of $64.40, and rose 6.7 per cent to $62.93, after a gain of 3.7 per cent a week earlier amid talk of sector consolidation. Other steelmakers rallied, led by AK Steel, up 10 per cent at $16.11 and Steel Dynamics, up 9.3 per cent at $32.84.Alcoa gained 8.2 per cent to $30.58 after it said it would join forces with Sapa Group, part of Norway’s Orkla ASA, and cut 6,700 jobs.Speculation over future private equity buy-out candidates helped push shares in Hilton Hotels to a 52-week high of $34.05 and its shares rose 9.2 per cent to $33.75.Kirk Kerkorian, the well-known corporate investor, and his Tracinda Corp disclosed plans to sell 14m shares in General Motors for $33, cutting its stake to 7.4 per cent.Tracinda also announced plans to raise its stake in the casino operator MGM Mirage to 61.7 per cent from 56.3 per cent.

404;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-11-22T15:43:46Z;Wall Street inches higher ahead of holiday;;Wall Street indices inched higher in New York on Tuesday, but several high profile stocks broke the market’s shackles in advance of the Thanksgiving holiday later this week.The imminent long weekend break is expected to cap the recent run in stocks, but some analysts believe the market has further room to rally in the coming weeks.“Given the popularity of the US large cap trade recommendation, it is useful to establish whether this is indeed a consensus, or crowded, trade,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.Looking at recent price moves and activity in the futures market, notably positioning by speculative investors, Mr Shairp concluded: “There is limited evidence that US stocks have become a crowded trade.”“US equities are still supported by improving liquidity and attractive valuations, compared to both bonds and their own history,” he said. “The US market looks a bit toppy in the short term, but is far from being a crowded trade.”For now, analysts said fallingvolatility could support a further rise in stocks.The Chicago Board of Trade’s Vix index fell below 10 on Monday and hit a low of 9.84 before closing at a 12½ year low of 9.89, below the closing low of 9.94 set in January 1994.Historically, such a low level for the Vix has reflected very strong appetite for risk-taking and has usually been followed by a sharp rise in volatility.Several companies hit record highs, led by Google. The internet search group’s shares climbed above $500 for the first time, hitting a peak of $510 before edging back to close 3 per cent higher at $509.65. Since reaching a low point of $367.23 on August 2, shares in the company have risen 38.9 per cent.Apple also closed at a record high of $88.60, up $2.13 or 2.2 per cent.Aircraft maker Boeing rose $1.98, or 2.2 per cent, to $91.10 after announcing an order from Korean Air for 25 aircraft worth $5.5bn.Boeing shares touched a high of $92.05, beating last week’s previous peak generated by reports it will win large orders in the region of $10bn.Shares in the NYSE Group also surged to a record high of $105.12, and closed 9.7 up on the day at $104.60. The company said its board would be split evenly between Europeans and Americans if it completes its proposed merger with Euronext. Investors saw the move as helping persuade shareholders in the European exchange to approve the deal.Shares in medical device maker Medtronic rose $4.60, or 9.4 per cent, to $53.55 after the company posted earnings excluding special items of of 59 cents a share, better than an expected 56 cents.The company also said it had gained a further 6 per cent market share for implantable cardioverter defibrillators, or ICDs, and now holds 56 per cent of the global market.In other earnings news, agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co. said its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings rose 19 per cent to 96 cents a share, beating estimates of 94 cents per share. Shares closed at $95.27, a rise of $5.86 or 6.6 per cent.Firmer oil prices boosted the energy sector and the American Stock Exchange oil index settled 1.7 per cent higher. Exxon Mobil gained 96 cents or 1.3 per cent to $73.39.The Philadelphia semiconductor index slid 1.3 per cent. That dragged on the Nasdaq Composite and it settled 2.12 points or 0.1 per cent higher at 2,454.84.The S&P 500 closed 2.31 points, or 0.2 per cent, firmer at 1,402.81.Traders note that the market faces a period of consolidation until the S&P can move above a technical barrier at 1,404, while the Nasdaq needs to rally above 2,457 in order to sustain further momentum.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also reversed early losses and ended the day 5.05 points or 0.04 per cent higher at 12,321.59.Computer maker Dell reported results after the bell Tuesday, and posted earnings of 30 cents a share, above estimates of 24 cents.

405;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Mining M&A doubles to more than $100bn;;The total value of mergers and acquisitions in the booming mining sector has exceeded $100bn so far this year, an industry record, and the wave of deals is expected to continue into 2007.This week’s $26bn take-over bid by Freeport McMoRan, the US copper producer, for Phelps Dodge, its larger rival, has pushed the total value of mining M&A deals in 2006 to about $113bn. Last year, deal-making activity totalled $57bn, while in 2004 there were $34.5bn of deals.Xstrata’s takeover of Falconbridge, CVRD’s purchase of Inco, and Goldcorp’s takeover of Glamis Gold have been among the largest deals this year in the sector.There has also been a rising level of merger activity among the smaller exploration companies. Last week, Mwana Africa, listed on London’s Aim market, made an offer for Gravity Diamonds, while Lonmin said it would buy platinum explorer AfriOre.Soaring base and precious metals prices have been the main drivers of the activity. Prices have been pushed up by a combination of strong demand from China and India, and supply constraints within the mining industry.High metals prices mean that mining groups are generating large amounts of cash, making it easier to launch takeover bids. There is a scramble to maximise metals production, and many companies are finding it easier to acquire assets than build new mines from scratch.Speaking at a mining conference in London on Tuesday, Jared Baker, of Barclays Capital, said metals prices were likely to fall from their current peaks, but would be supported at historically high levels. “The amount of M&A activity in base metals, and the fact that they are cash deals, shows that companies have an aggressive view on continued high prices.”Mark Sawyer, general manager for business development at Xstrata, said prices would stay at relatively high levels because of metals shortages, a hangover from a lack of investment in mining exploration in the last commodity downturn.“Today there is a real dearth of good quality projects, and this represents a serious challenge for the mining industry. Prices over the next couple of years will moderate, but we firmly believe in a stronger-for-longer maxim.”Mr Sawyer added that the heady pace of mining M&A was likely to continue next year. “The sector is consolidating at a rate of knots and shows no signs of abating.”Medium-sized mining companies are increasingly doing deals in order to be more diversified, by geography and by commodity. Mr Sawyer said that large, diversified groups had produced better returns over the years than single commodity groups. Xstrata started life as a coal company but, through a series of ambitious takeovers, has branched out into copper, zinc and nickel. The group is currently working on the integration of Falconbridge’s assets, but it is already looking at new acquisition opportunities and is thought to have its eye on Anglo American
406;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-11-20T23:18:21Z;Freeport/Phelps Dodge;;Freeport-McMoRan’s offer for Phelps Dodge epitomises today’s financial markets. It is a leveraged reverse takeover predicated on booming demand for commodities – copper, in this instance. In terms of market capitalisation, Freeport is 58 per cent the size of Phelps. It is helped in its endeavour by Phelps’s $3.2bn of net cash, equivalent to 18 per cent of the cash portion of the $25.8bn price tag, and the fact that 30 per cent of the offer consists of Freeport paper. There are few, if any, cost synergies.It will require a robust copper price to cut quickly net debt, which will stand at about two times pro forma earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Copper has fallen by 22 per cent since May, as China has run down inventories and fears of a day of reckoning in the US housing market have taken hold. Still, the current price of about $6,700 a tonne remains very healthy by historical standards. Chinese restocking could kick in again next quarter and further strikes could disrupt supply. Certainly, the fact that miners are buying one another at a rate of knots suggests a lack of meaningful greenfield projects to invest in. Freeport needs to diversify away from its main Grasberg mine in Indonesia and wants growth. Phelps, having failed in its own acquisition attempts this year, was under pressure to do something from that other feature of today’s financial landscape: an activist hedge fund.Phelps’s shareholders should be reasonably pleased with the outcome. The 33 per cent premium to Phelps’ closing price last Friday is one reason. The other is that Freeport’s move raises the prospect of a bidding war – the norm for metals and mining deals these days. Taken together, though, the defining features of Freeport’s offer should raise concerns that a peak in mining valuations is near.
407;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-11-20T21:59:09Z;Wall St plays it safe as deals surge;;Wall Street stocks delivered a cautious performance in New York on Monday, as some $50bn in proposed merger deals across copper, steel, exchanges and real estate captured investors’ attention.Consolidation in the steel sector was a major theme, in the wake of Russia’s Evraz Group announcing on Monday that it intends buying US steelmaker Oregon Steel Mills valuing the company around $2.3bn. The $63.25 per share purchase represents a 7 per cent premium over Oregon’s close last week. Shares in Oregon jumped to a high of $64.40, and settled higher by $4.81 or 8.2 per cent at $63.77. Late last week, as talk of takeover deals in the global steel industry gathered pace, Oregon’s shares rose 3.7 per cent.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq, tendered an offer to buy the rest of the London Stock Exchange, in a deal that would value its shares at $5.1bn and build upon its current 25 per cent holding in the LSE. Shares in Nasdaq were slightly off their high of $37.83, up 3.1 per cent at $37.71. The LSE rejected the new offer, saying it “substantially undervalued” the exchange.“We believe Nasdaq’s final offer fails to recognize the outstanding growth record and prospects of our group on a stand-alone basis let alone the exchange’s unique global position,” said Clara Furse, chief executive of the LSE.Another blockbuster deal in the spotlight was Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold saying it would acquire Phelps Dodge in a $25.9bn deal including cash and stock. The new entity would be the world’s largest publicly traded copper company.Shares in Phelps, soared to a high of $123.96 and ultimately gained $25.45, or 26.8 per cent to $120.47. Free-port shares were down $1.77 cents, or 3.1 per cent at $56.63, after earlier rising to $59.70.The private equity firm Blackstone Group said it was buying Equity Office Properties Trust, the largest office-building owner and manager in the US, for $20bn. Shares in the company hit a high of $47.94, and closed up $3.42, or 7.7 per cent at $48.14. The BBG real estate investment trust index closed up 3.2 per cent after the news.The latest surge in deals, dictated in part by private equity firms hunting for opportunities “heightens the risk for short sellers,” argues Citigroup. “When markets slip initially and then reverse to the upside, as has happened several times over the last few weeks, hedge funds have to cover painful losses.”After opening in the red, stocks briefly recovered ground, led by the semi-conductor sector and Microsoft setting a new 52-week high of $29.97 after an upgrade from Credit Suisse. Shares in Microsoft closed 1.7 per cent firmer at $29.89, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index was up 1.5 per cent after booking a gain of 5.7 per cent last week. Marvell Technology was 9.5 per cent higher at $20.45, Broadcom was 5.7 per cent higher at $37.11, and Novellus gained 7.7 per cent to $33.10.The Nasdaq Composite lead other indices during the day and settled 6.86 points, or 0.3 per cent firmer at 2,452.72.The S&P 500 slid 0.70 points, or 0.05 per cent to 1,400.50, having reversed an early fall below the 1,400 threshold it closed above on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26.02 points, or 0.21 per cent to 12,316.54, while in contrast small capitalised stocks rose. The Russell 2000 index gained 0.3 per cent to 790.62.Despite the paring of modest gains in equity prices during the afternoon, a closely watched measure of equity volatility sank towards historic lows.The Chicago Board of Trade’s VIX index fell below 10, to 9.91, before it closed at 9.97. Historically, such a low level in VIX has reflected very high appetites for risk taking and has usually been followed by a sharp rise in the volatility measure.“Falling volatility is partly an indication of investor optimism. As long as it keeps falling it confirms (or supports) the uptrend in stocks,” noted Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader.Helping offset weakness in the Dow was Dupont, after a favourable press report over the weekend, and shares gained 1.3 per cent higher at $47.87.In the chase for high net worth banking clients, Bank of America has announced a deal to buy U.S. Trust from Charles Schwab for $3.3bn. Shares in Bank of America were barely changed at $54.90.Other steel companies that enjoyed solid gains on Friday were also higher early on Monday, before paring some of those gains.Shares in US Steel, rose 3.1 per cent to $72.75, down from a high of $76.16, after a rise of 9.3 per cent on Friday.

The company also lowered guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, saying it expects to earn 36 to 38 cents a share, below the 41 cents a share seen by analysts. Its shares had rebounded from a low of $29.50 and were 0.3 per cent firmer at $30.58.After a blockbuster debut on Friday, that resulted in its shares rising 125 per cent, the New York Mercantile Exchange had reversed an earlier rise to $140, and closed down 2.1 per cent at $130.27.Ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, stocks may well endure a period of consolidation, and while some analysts caution the market’s solid run has stretched valuations, others disagree.“We do not think that we have hit any peaks in the market yet,” noted analysts at Citigroup in research on Monday. “To a great degree, equity markets are not overvalued” and applying various valuation methods, “argues more forcefully for larger cap stocks since they are the ones that appear more favourably valued.”Meanwhile, the appetite of investors for risky assets may also be turning towards equities at the relative expense of other markets as the end of the year approaches.“Many traders feel that the easier risky asset trade is directly in equities, given a belief that valuations are less extended than in the credit market or emerging currencies,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. “This logic makes perfect sense,” he said noting “the Fed is more clearly on a path that is likely to soft land the economy than any time in the last 6 months,” after the tone of recent inflation and housing market reports.In equity fund flows, Emerging Portfolio Fund Research noted net outflows from dedicated US funds for the week ending November 16 were $861.6m. They noted “a second week of net outflows, due mainly to investors retreating from a popular energy sector ETF,” that was hit by redemptions. “Otherwise, US equity funds would have received inflows, with money flowing into both the Large Cap Equity Funds and Small Cap Equity Funds,” said EPFR. In contrast, “Mid Cap Equity Funds saw outflows for the week,” they added.
408;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-11-20T21:00:50Z;Cheap debt drives ‘merger mania’;;Companies and investors around the world announced deals worth more than $75bn in a 24-hour period, driven by the commodities boom, the globalisation of financial markets and the protracted availability of inexpensive debt to finance takeovers.From mining to commercial property to exchanges, entire sectors are being reshaped as deal volumes hover around their previous peak during the internet bubble six years ago.On Monday, the rush was led by Blackstone, the US private equity group, which agreed to buy Equity Office Properties, the Chicago-based commercial real estate group founded by Sam Zell, for $36bn including debt. The deal is the largest leveraged buy-out on record, highlighting the extent to which private pools of money are coming to dominate vast swathes of the global economy.In addition, Freeport-McMoRan of New Orleans unveiled the $26bn purchase of Phelps Dodge to create the world’s largest publicly traded copper company. The move reflects confidence that China’s economic development will keep commodity prices high for the foreseeable future.“We know we are in a very robust M&A market and this is a continuation of it,” said Mark Shafir, global head of M&A at Lehman Brothers. More than $3,100bn worth of transactions have been announced so far this year, compared with $3,400bn for the whole year in 2000 and $3,250bn in 1999, according to Thomson Financial.Paul Taubman, global head of M&A at Morgan Stanley, adds: “It’s a very different marketplace than the last boom: these are cash, not stock, deals and there are far more public to privates.”The flurry of deals has bolstered revenues at investment banks that rake in large fees from advising on mergers and arranging financing for leveraged buy-outs.However, there are concerns that the current dealmaking cycle may be unsustainable. In the event of an economic downturn, companies that were taken over by private equity groups may have trouble servicing their higher debtloads. Higher default rates could lead to a wider slump in the credit markets, whose strength has underpinned the M&A frenzy.Monday’s deals included a move by Russia’s Evraz to buy Oregon Steel Mills for $2.5bn and Bank of America’s $3.3bn acquisition of US Trust from its parent, Charles Schwab. In addition, Nasdaq made its latest attempt to take over the London Stock Exchange with a bid worth $5.1bn.
409;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-11-20T18:15:35Z;Platinum up on ETF speculation;;Platinum prices rose on Monday, supported by rumours about the launch of an exchange traded fund (ETF) to mimic the success of similar gold and silver funds in boosting investor demand.Platinum rose 5.1 per cent to $1,246 a troy ounce after hitting a 2½ month high of $1,264. Dealers said if an ETF was backed by physical buying, this could create significant additional demand, but cautioned that higher prices could damage jewellery demand further.Last week, Johnson Matthey, the metals group, predicted record demand for platinum of 7.02m ounces this year but noted that jewellery industry consumption was likely to fall 10 per cent due to high and volatile prices.Gold was 0.5 per cent firmer at $624.10 a troy ounce while silver was 1 per cent higher at $12.88 a troy ounce.Copper prices were supported by news of the Freeport McMoRan and Phelps Dodge merger agreement, and the red metal rose 0.6 per cent to $6,840 a tonne in spite of a rise of 2,050 tonnes in LME stocks. Speculative short positions have risen to the highest level since October 2002 and the price has sunk below its 200-day moving average, so further downward pressure appears likely.Zinc rose 3.6 per cent to $4,169 a tonne, supported by a fall of 1,150 tonnes in LME stocks.Nickel regained the $30,000 level, up 2.2 per cent to $30,250 a tonne after a fall of 108 tonnes in LME stocks.Weakness for oil prices continued with ICE January Brent falling 23 cents to $58.76 a barrel while Nymex January West Texas Intermediate lost 44 cents at $58.54 a barrel.Over the weekend, oil ministers from Qatar and Algeria signalled their support for a further output cut by the Organisation of the Petroleum Countries as the market remained oversupplied.However, Opec’s acting secretary Mohammed Barkindo said the market should give the cartel at least one month to decide on the impact of its production cuts.Goldman Sachs said the weakness in US crude prices was an isolated phenomenon and that other markets were already responding to Opec’s moves to cut supplies.Speculators have shifted to playing the crude market on the long side after the recent fall in prices. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed speculators had moved to a net long position in crude for the first time since late September last week.Lehman Brothers said it expected US crude prices to average $73.50 a barrel next year as the global oil market continues to tighten, with demand growing by 1.7m barrels a day while non-Opec supply is only expected to increase by 1m b/d.Corn prices rose after Argentina’s decision to suspend corn export permits indefinitely. Corn exports from China are also facing delays after warm weather slowed harvesting, pushing prices in Guangzhou towards their highest levels this year.The export delays in Argentina and China added to concerns about global supplies and market tightness which have helped drive US corn prices to a 10-year high recently. In Chicago, the December wheat contract traded 9¾ cents higher at $3.65 a bushel.Sugar prices were weaker, with the London March 2007 contract trading $2.50 lower at $351 a tonne after Czarnikow, the sugar merchant, raised its forecast for the global sugar surplus in 2006-7 to 5.1m tonnes from a previous estimate of 3.1m tonnes.“We have seen a further rise in production forecasts as a result of good weather and confirmation of increased plantings,” said Czarnikow in its monthly report.The International Sugar Organisation forecast a global surplus of 5.8m tonnes for 2006/07 earlier this month. Sugar prices reached multi-year highs earlier this year as hedge funds increasingly viewed its usage in ethanol as a play on energy prices. However, the decline in oil prices and the forecasts of an increasing supply surplus has put severe downward pressure on sugar prices subsequently.

But support from the mining sector helped turn sentiment round after US metals group Freeport-McMoRan agreed to buy copper miner Phelps Dodge for $25.9bn.Takeover speculation has helped fuel global equity market gains in 2006, as M&A reached a record $3,368bn this year, according to figures released last week by financial researcher Dealogic. This beat the previous record set in 2000 during the dotcom boom.Among the other deals announced on Monday, Nasdaq, the US trading platform, launched a £2.7bn ($5.1bn) bid for the London Stock Exchange, while Bank of America agreed to buy Charles Schwab’s US Trust private banking division for $3.3bn. Blackstone Group, the private equity company, agreed to purchase Equity Office Properties Trust for $20bn.This left the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index 0.33 per cent higher, turning round earlier losses of more than 0.5 per cent.In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.21 per cent lower; the S&P 500 reversed modest gains and closed down 0.05 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend and gained 0.3 per cent.Asian equity markets set a bearish tone as the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell to its lowest close in nearly four months. The Japanese benchmark fell 2.3 per cent to 15,725.94, its lowest since September, while the broader Topix fell 2.5 per cent to 1,533.94.Fears that Japan’s economic growth might not be as strong as forecast caused investors to take profits in banks ahead of results in the sector this week.Reports in the Japanese weekend press suggested the country’s growth outlook might be downgraded for the first time in 23 months, amid signs of slower consumer spending. The yen fell 0.3 per cent against the euro to a new low of Y151.45 as investors gave up any expectations of the Bank of Japan raising interest rates again this year.This was clearly not the case in the eurozone as Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank president, left the markets in no doubt about the bank’s next rate move.Speaking at the weekend’s G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Melbourne, Mr Trichet repeated his message from the last ECB policy meeting on the need to be “strongly vigilant” on eurozone inflation. The euro gained 0.1 per cent against the dollar to $1.2830.Eurozone government bonds, however, moved higher in spite of Mr Trichet’s hawkish tone.With a 25-basis point rate increase now fully priced in for December’s ECB meeting, eurozone bonds were modestly firmer, while US Treasuries were mixed in light trade.Oil prices showed little inclination to move out of their recent trading range as concerns over mild winter weather, plentiful supply and the validity of production cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries persisted.Crude prices fell early on after buyers of Opec oil said they had been informed of cuts amounting to a total of 575,000 barrels a day – less than half the 1.2m b/d proposed by Opec.In New York trade, the benchmark Nymex WTI front-month contract settled at $58.58 a barrel."

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
412;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-11-20T00:08:52Z;Freeport acquires Phelps for $26bn;;"Freeport-McMoRan on Sunday night agreed to buy Phelps Dodge for $25.9bn (£13.7bn) in cash and stock to become the world’s largest publicly traded copper company with mines stretching from Indonesia to Chile.The takeover is the latest in a wave of consolidation that has swept through the global mining industry as commodity prices soared because of high demand, particularly from China.Amid the boom, both Freeport and Phelps were faced with key strategic challenges that they decided to address by combining the two companies. Freeport has been seeking ways to diversify away from its main Grasberg mine, which is based in a remote part of Indonesian Papua and has been criticised for containing too much political risk.Phelps, on the other hand, has been a takeover target since its twin bid for Canadian mining groups Inco and Falconbridge fell apart in September.Under the terms of the deal, Phelps shareholders will receive $126.46 per share – or a 33 per cent premium to the company’s market value on Friday. About
70 per cent of the transaction value, or $18bn, will be in cash, with the rest in shares, meaning Phelps investors will end up owning 38 per cent of the combined group.In an interview last night, Richard Adkerson, the chief executive of Freeport who will run the combined group, said the deal made sense in a wide range of scenarios for the copper price.He added that the greater size would make his company much stronger: “Scale is important because it will allow us to have better access to resources, suppliers and project opportunities in a way that is limited for smaller companies.”Although the deal is structured as a takeover by Freeport, the company’s headquarters will move from New Orleans to Phelps’ home of Phoenix, Arizona. Steve Whisler, chief executive of Phelps, will retire.The new Freeport will become one of the most powerful forces in global mining, generating cashflow of about $6.5bn from the production of about 3.1bn pounds of copper, 1.7m ounces of gold, and 69m pounds of molybdenum. As well as Freeport’s Grasberg mine, the combined group will own Phelps operations in North and South America and control the Tenke Fungurume copper-cobalt project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The deal is the latest in a wave of transactions in the global mining industry. In recent months, Brazil’s Companhia Vale do Rio Doce agreed to take over Inco, while Falconbridge was acquired by Xstrata.Freeport was advised by bankers at JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch and lawyers at Davis Polk and Jones Walker. Phelps was advised by Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Debevoise."

428;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-06-29T20:43:18Z;Wall Street surges on rate decision;;"Wall Street enjoyed a dramatic rally on Thursday, surging in the final hours after news on interest rates from the Federal Reserve.The wave of buying pushed all main indices up sharply, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average enjoying its best day since April 2005.The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee said economic growth was moderating but inflation expectations were “contained”. Initial reaction was that its brief statement left it more leeway to discontinue its campaign of tightening interest rates.Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, said the post-decision rally was an expression of investor relief. “The market is breathing a sigh of relief that it’s over and we can now get on with our lives,” he said.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 2.2 per cent, or 26.87 points, at 1,272.87, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 3 per cent, or 62.54 points, at 2,174.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2 per cent, or 217.24 points, at 11,190.80. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies leapt 3.5 per cent.All the main indices jumped by between one and two percentage points in the aftermath of the Fed announcement.Energy stocks rose steeply, aided by strong crude prices, which reached $73 a barrel. Valero rose 4.3 per cent to a six-week high of $66.13, and Sunoco gained 5.3 per cent to $68.73.Duke Energy leapt 4.6 per cent to $29.69 after announcing on Wednesday that it would spin off its natural gas business to its shareholders. The move prompted Lehman Brothers to raise its rating on the stock from “equal weight” to “over weight”.Stronger copper and gold prices buoyed mining stocks. Freeport McMoran rose
10.2 per cent to $55.26, and Barrick Gold gained 5.3 per cent to $29.28.Healthcare provider Cigna rose 5 per cent to $96.26 after an announcement that the company’s stock buy-back programme would be increased by a further $500m.Open-source software maker Red Hat was a rare loser, plunging 6.4 per cent to $23.40, its lowest level since November.

Revenue came in below analysts' expectations.But there were gains elsewhere in the technology sector, with Jabil up 6.3 per cent to $25.74 after it announced it would buy back $200m worth of shares. Electronic Arts was up 5.1 per cent to $43.47.Consumer stocks performed well. McDonald’s added 5 per cent to $33.56 and Starbucks soared 6.3 per cent to $37.97."
429;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-06-27T16:27:06Z;World Gold Council membership expands;;The World Gold Council, the industry body funded by gold miners, is expected to announce this week that it has attracted seven new members, the first significant expansion in membership since it was founded in 1987.The council’s board is expected to ratify the new additions at a meeting in London on Wednesday.The addition of new members represents a turnaround for the London-based body, which was long considered an ineffective and expensively run organisation. But in the past three years, the council has changed management, bringing in Jim Burton from Calpers who has cut staffing numbers, closed some overseas offices and spearheaded the launch of gold investment products in the form of exchange traded funds.The council is expected to announce that Agnico-Eagle Mines, Cambior, Coeur D’Alene Mines, Eldorado Gold Corp, Goldcorp, IAM Gold and Kinross are becoming members. This will lift its membership to 24, representing about 38 per cent of annual gold production of about 2,500 tonnes.“This is an important development for the council, because it shows the industry is more supportive and is endorsing the council’s strategy,” said Pierre Lassonde, chairman of the council and president of Newmont.Mr Lassonde has a plan to increase the WGC’s membership to represent about half of global output. About two-thirds of global gold output is produced by mainstream gold miners. The balance is mined by state-owned and small private companies, or miners where gold is a by-product.Existing members include the world’s biggest gold miners Newmont, Anglogold Ashanti, Barrick Gold and Gold Fields of South Africa. The South African-based Harmony and Freeport McMoRan are the two biggest gold producers that are not members of the council.Many council members think non-members are benefiting from its initiatives but are not prepared to share the cost of having a body primarily focused on marketing to create more demand for gold.The turnaround in the gold price in the past three years has boosted the coffers of gold producers, many of which have accumulated significant cash piles.The launch of gold-backed ETFs has been the most successful initiative under Mr Burton’s stewardship of the council. They have attracted investment that equates to about 500 tonnes of gold since being launched three years ago.

432;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-06-09T20:55:12Z;Wall Street falls back after heavy sell-off;;Wall Street fell back this week as three days of heavy selling dragged down the main stock indices.During the week, the S&P 500 briefly dipped into negative territory for the year.At one stage the Nasdaq Composite had fallen more than 10 per cent from its high in May, the scale of decline that many market watchers define as a correction. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell back below 11,000.Chipmakers trailed the market, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropping 6.4 per cent. On Wednesday, Citigroup re-vised down its sales forecasts for Intel and Advanced Micro Devices citing the possibility of a price war be-tween the chipmakers.Intel subsequently raised the possibility of just such a price war when it announced late on Thursday that it would cut prices by 60 per cent to gain market share. Intel fell 5.9 per cent to $17.16 and AMD dropped 11.1 per cent to $26.75.Broadcom plunged 14.5 per cent to $29.33 as its top salesman quit.Copper for July delivery fell more than 8 per cent and gold prices eased, impacting on the S&P Materials Index, which had its worst week since April 2005. Freeport McMoran fell 13.6 per cent to $49.03, and Phelps Dodge dropped 8.9 per cent to $79.01. Newmont Mining shed 7.5 per cent to $49.31.Homebuilders continued to decline. Pulte was down 9.8 per cent to $28.27, and KB Homes dropped 12.4 per cent to $44.74. Standard Pacific dropped 13.3 per cent to $26.02. The S&P Homebuilders Index dropped 7.4 per cent, its worst weekly fall since November.Tribune Group was the best performer in the S&P 500, boosted by reports that it might spin off its broadcasting unit, and confirmation that it would proceed with a $2bn share buyback. The stock gained 6.7 per cent to $31.96. Also bucking the trend in the S&P 500 was BMC Software, which rose after reporting increased profits for the fourth quarter, aided by higher sales and cost-cutting. The shares received a further fillip from upgrades from Piper Jaffray and Goldman Sachs. BMC was up 6.3 per cent for the week at $22.02.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent, or 5.63 points, for the day at 1,252.30, a loss of 2.8 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5 per cent, or 10.26 points, for the day at 2,135.06, a weekly decline of 3.8 per cent. The Dow was down 0.4 per cent, or 46.90 points, for the day to 10,891.92, a loss for the week of 3.2 per cent, its worst week in a year. “We had a choir of Fed members singing to the same tune, that basically interest rates needed to go higher because of oil prices beginning to impact on inflation,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach.“That weighed on stocks and the correction continued. I suspect that the market was discounting higher rates of inflation and higher interest rates.”As the sell-off gathered pace, fears about inflation and interest rate rises – for a long time the dominant concern on Wall Street – were joined by broader fears about the health of the economy. This pushed up traditionally defensive consumer staple stocks such as Procter & Gamble and Molson Coors, while cyclical stocks suffered. Consumer staples groups Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson were rare gainers in the Dow.P&G added 0.9 per cent to $54.45, posting its biggest one day gain in over a year on Thursday. J&J was up 1.1 per cent to $61.38.Also attractive to skittish investors was brewer Molson Coors, which jumped 2.6 per cent to $67.96. Molson has gained 7 per cent in the past two weeks. “Defensive issues have become more fashion-able,” said Mr Cardillo.Slowdown fears meant investors shied away from cyclical and durable goods stocks. Monster Worldwide, the advertising and recruitment company, fell 11.7 per cent to $42.00, while construction equipment maker Caterpillar fell 7.3 per cent to $67.52.General Motors fell 4.3 per cent to $25.35.Exchange consolidation remained in focus as the NYSE Group’s agreed tie-up with Euronext ran into political opposition. Jacques Chirac, the French president, said he preferred a Deutsche Börse-Euronext combination, sending NYSE Group down 12.7 per cent to $57.15. Nasdaq fell 8.7 per cent to $27.41.
433;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-06-08T21:00:57Z;Wall Street flat after volatile session;;Wall Street ended flat on Thursday after a session of exceptional volatility sparked by growing investor concern about the US economy and interest rates. A late afternoon bounce pulled stocks back from an aggressive sell-off that for several hours had the S&P in negative territory for the year.“Some buyers jumped back in, but it was definitely a round trip,” said Brian Williamson, equity trader at Boston Company Asset Management.“There was a little bit of bottom fishing, and it’s definitely encouraging that the market held just below major support levels. It’s a positive sign that it bounced back like this.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 1.78 points, to 1,257.93, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3 per cent, or 6.48 points, to 2,145.32 – at one point falling more than 10 per cent from its May high, the threshold many analysts believe constitutes a market correction.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, up 7.92 points at 10,938.82.Reports of the killing of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaeda’s leader in Iraq, helped crude prices drop, but they recovered most of their fall later in the day, paring the losses made by energy stocks.Tribune jumped 4.2 per cent to $31.58 after the newspaper group said it was proceeding with its $2bn share buyback offer. There were reports it might also spin off its broadcasting group.Procter & Gamble proved attractive for investors skittish about a slowing economy. The world’s biggest consumer goods maker rose 2.8 per cent to $54.74, its best day in more than a year.Consumer goods and food retailers, both defensive plays, were the best performing sectors in the S&P.Fears of a slowing economy also fed through to advertising and recruitment company Monster Worldwide, which tumbled 4.9 per cent to $42.45.Novellus Systems, the manufacturer of semiconductor-making equipment, added 7.6 per cent to $24.16 after it raised its revenue and earnings forecasts. But other chipmakers suffered. Citigroup cut its price target on both Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, citing the risk of a price war between the two. Intel fell 1.6 per cent to $17.11 and AMD dipped 3.5 per cent to $27.03.Apple Computer rose 3.8 per cent to $60.76 on reports that the company might escape antitrust fines from the European Commission. Other technology stocks to gain included Electronic Arts, which added 2.7 per cent to $42.38.Allergan added 3.9 per cent to $102.27 after announcing that it had won FDA approval for a new drug to treat facial wrinkles.Gold continued to fall, dragging materials stocks down with it. Barrick Gold dropped 2.2 per cent to $28.17 and Freeport McMoran shed 2.6 per cent to $49.93. Newmont Mining fell 1.4 per cent to $49.77.
434;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-06-05T19:23:37Z;Wall St slumps as Bernanke warns on inflation;;US stocks moved sharply lower on Monday as Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned of the need to remain vigilant on inflation in spite of signs of slowing economic growth.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite index had their worst days since January, also weighed down by concerns over Iran that pushed oil prices higher.“I think the market is digesting the after-effects of Friday’s payroll numbers and has concerns about a weaker economy,” said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak.Blue-chips, housebuilders, and materials producers all turned lower. Boeing fell 2 per cent to $82.13, while Caterpillar dropped 4.8 per cent to $69.33.Homebuilders were among the worst performers in the S&P 500. Pulte fell for a second day after its announcement on Friday that it was cutting its profit forecast for 2006. The shares dropped 5 per cent to $29.75. Standard Pacific was also lower, shedding 8.6 per cent to $27.43 after it too announced late on Friday that it would cut its 2006 earnings forecast.Speaking at the International Monetary Conference in Washington, Mr Bernanke said the Fed would be “vigilant” on inflation – raising the odds of further interest rate rises – in spite of moderating economic growth.Earlier in the day, the Institute for Supply Management’s services index for May foreshadowed Mr Bernanke’s remarks, with a modest overall decline suggesting economic deceleration, but a jump in the prices paid component hinted at inflationary pressures.Real estate investment trusts was the only sector that posted gains in the S&P 500. The announcement that Brookfield Properties would buy Trizec sent its shares up 16.6 per cent to $28.68.Equity Office Properties also gained on the news, adding 4 per cent to $36.41.At the close, the S&P 500 index was down 1.8 per cent, or 22.93 points, at 1,265.29, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.2 per cent, or 49.79 points, at 2,169.62.

The flash memory maker lost 1.8 per cent to $54.12, a 10 week low.Internet telephony provider Vonage gained 2.8 per cent to $12.32. On Friday, investors who bought shares in the company’s initial public offering filed a class-action lawsuit. Shares have fallen almost 30 per cent since the IPO less than two weeks ago.
435;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-05-25T21:05:27Z;Wall St takes heart from commodity gains;;US stocks closed higher on Thursday as investors took heart from gross domestic product and housing data, while higher commodity prices boosted the energy and materials sector.MasterCard’s successful debut helped offset the hangover from the disappointing flotation by Vonage the day before. Shares in Yahoo and Ebay also rallied after the two internet companies announced a strategic tie-up.Investors cheered first-quarter GDP growth and slowing home sales data, which both slightly reduced pressure for further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. At 5.3 per cent, first-quarter GDP growth was short of forecasts.“The GDP number was very satisfying,” said Barry Hyman, equity market strategist at Ehrenkrantz, King Nussbaum.“There’s a building faith that the Fed is not going to raise interest rates. I think we’ve turned the corner in terms of the sell-off.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 1.1 per cent, or 14.31 points, at 1,272.88, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3 per cent, or 29.07 points, to 2,198.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which celebrated its 110th anniversary yesterday, rose 0.8 per cent, or 93.73 points, to 11,211.05.Investors paid special attention to MasterCard’s debut. The credit card company sold its shares at $39, making the initial public offering worth about $2.4bn. Investor demand pushed shares up 18 per cent to $46.00.Vonage, the internet telephony group which debuted on Wednesday, continued its slide, shedding a further 12.5 per cent to $13.00. It has lost more than 24 per cent in two days.The S&P oil index gained 3 per cent. Oil services group Halliburton added 5.4 per cent to $73.80, and Occidental Petroleum gained 4.3 per cent to $97.87, buoyed further by statements from the oil minister of Ecuador that it would not seize a pipeline the company owns there.Copper and gold also edged higher sending Freeport-McMoran up 5.5 per cent to $56.01, and Newmont Mining up 5.2 per cent $52.08.Ebay jumped 12.2 per cent to $33.88 after it announced it had entered into a multi-year advertising partnership with Yahoo, which also rose on the news, adding 3.6 per cent to $32.92.General Motors jumped 5.2 per cent to $27.90 after more employees than expected signed up for its cost-cutting buy-out programme. GM has gained more than 14 per cent in the past two days.

436;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-05-23T20:43:36Z;Wall Street slides in late trading;;Wall Street turned sharply lower in the last hour on Tuesday erasing gains made earlier in the day. A rise in the price of oil and metals had given momentum to energy and mining stocks, while homebuilders also climbed.“Very simply, the recovery was extremely unimpressive,” said Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Associates “It was based on low volume, and was uninspiring. There was no clear signal today that the market had found a bottom.”“It’s got bear market written all over it,” said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak.Stronger demand for oil sent crude prices rising. Marathon, an oil producer, added 2.4 per cent to $74.17. Valero, an oil refiner, rose 2.8 per cent to $58.69, more than making up for Monday’s losses, which were caused by a refinery fire.Metals also rode a rally, and on Nymex, copper trading had to be suspended for 15 minutes as prices leapt by more than 5 per cent. Phelps Dodgegained 4.1 per cent to $83.06 and Freeport-McMoran, the copper and gold producer, added 2.3 per cent to $55.53.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent, or 5.49 points, at 1,256.58, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.7 per cent, or 14.10 points, at 2,158.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent, or 26.98 points, to 11,098.35.Heinz climbed 5 per cent to $42.98 after an activist shareholder group led by Nelson Peltz called on the food group to cut costs and increase share buy-backs in a plan that could double the share price.

The company cut earnings guidance for 2006, but reported a 3 per cent rise in quarterly profit.Pulte and DR Horton followed Toll’s lead, gaining 0.6 per cent to $32.94 and 2.5 per cent to $27.00 respectively. The three have fallen by between 27 and 36 per cent since mid-January on fears that rising rates would hurt the construction sector.Sun Microsystems was less robust, falling 5.5 per cent to $4.29 after investors were told the company was ready to “re-size” by cutting costs and shedding jobs.Adobe Systems lost 3 per cent to $29.02 as it insisted that a tool for creating PDF files in Microsoft’s next version of Office would not hurt sales. Wyeth dipped 3 per cent to $47.40 after it was disclosed that its experimental anti-depressant induced nausea in trials.
437;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-04-11T02:09:15Z;Freeport chiefs cash in $130m options;;The top two executives at Freeport-McMoRan, the New Orleans-based miner, have cashed in stock options with a face value of more than $130m in the past six months, according to their US Securities and Exchange Commission filings.The exercise and sale of those options comes on top of 2005 compensation packages for James “Jim Bob” Moffett, chairman, and Richard Adkerson, president and chief executive, together valued at $77.3m by the company in its SEC filings.Freeport, whose share price has hit new highs thanks to a global commodities boom, is facing heightened pressure from nationalist politicians and indigenous people near its Grasberg mine over the equitable distribution of revenues. Grasberg, the world’s largest copper and gold mine located in Indonesia’s remote Papua province, is the company’s main asset.Local discontent with soaring profits and executive compensation when prices are booming will be a problem for many international mining companies operating in impoverished countries.Nationalist politicians, including Amien Rais, a former presidential candidate, have made calls for the mine to be closed.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Adkerson defended his and Mr Moffett’s 2005 compensation as reflective of “an unusual year”, during which Grasberg’s copper and gold production increased sharply.Freeport’s share of 2005 production was 2.8m oz of gold and almost 1.5bn lbs of copper against this year’s expected 1.7m oz of gold and 1.3bn lbs of copper.Mr Adkerson insisted the exercise of options by himself and Mr Moffett in recent months were “just a matter of personal financial prudence” and meant to diversify the executives’ investments. According to an FT review of the executives’ SEC filings, Mr Moffett and Mr Adkerson disposed of more than 2.4m Freeport shares in transactions worth $131.1m between October and February of this year.During that period, Mr Adkerson reported selling more than 780,000 shares in transactions worth $42.3m, although the sales netted him just $16.5m as $25.8m in shares were withheld to cover either the exercise price of options or taxes, according to his filings.Mr Moffett, who stepped aside after decades as chief executive in 2003, recorded the biggest gains. Mr Moffett reported disposing of almost 1.7m shares in transactions worth $88.8m between November 2 2005 and February 6 2006. Of that, more than $50m was withheld to cover the exercise price of stock options or taxes with his net take $38.5m, according to his filings.The sale of those shares – together with his record $19.4m bonus last year – have raised questions about how long Mr Moffett intends to stay at Freeport.
438;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-04-10T11:20:55Z;Commodity prices continue upward charge;;The five-year commodity price boom that has catapulted metal, energy and some agricultural prices to record highs continued on Monday and is set to extend further, according to investors, mining groups and sector analysts.Commodities – from copper and zinc to orange juice and refined sugar – reached fresh nominal highs last week. But, instead of signalling a top of the market, hedge funds and some mining executives believe prices have further to rise because they remain far from their highs in real price terms.On Monday, commodities extended their record breaking run with gold reaching a 25 year high of $598 a troy ounce, silver touching a 23 year high of $12.50, copper and zinc hitting new highs of $5,930 and $2,917.5 a tonne respectively, and Brent crude futures 61 cents higher at $67.90 a barrel and within $1 of their record high.The upward spiral is being fuelled by global economic growth, tight supply and rising inflows of investment, compounded by conservative planning prices among mining companies which have held back mining investment, say analysts and hedge fund managers.In the case of copper, global inventories have fallen because, even though demand is outpacing supply, many mining companies remain sceptical that current prices will last.Richard Adkerson, chief executive of Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold, which mines copper and gold deposits in Indonesia, told the Financial Times that he could not see why long-term planning prices should be changed.“Metal prices, like all commodities, they are cyclical, and I don’t see any reason to change the long-term planning price because prices are higher,” he said.Most copper miners base investment decisions on a long-term planning price of 80-90 cents a pound. However, the price has quadrupled in the past four years to about $2.70 a pound.But investors argue that mining companies’ conservatism is merely helping fuel higher commodity prices.“You have this standoff between the producers who think these commodity prices are not real, and are therefore not investing enough in new supply, and the hedge funds who are putting more money into the commodity market because they see that the producers are not reacting quickly enough by bringing on new supplies,” said one hedge fund manager.Commodity prices are also drawing attention from European pension funds seeking to diversify away from equities and bonds. The move signals longer-term investor interest in the sector. As a result, some in the commodities industry believe prices are set for an upward re-rating.“There seems to be an acceptance that we are going to have higher oil prices for longer, as the days of $20 oil appear to be over. I think there needs to be the same debate over metal prices,” Charlie Sartain, chief executive of Xstrata Copper, told a mining conference last week.He added that commodity price inflation is also partly due to increased production costs. The cost of producing copper, where the price last week reached $5,825 a tonne, had risen because of higher energy prices and the fact that new deposits lay in more remote and deeper locations.
439;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-04-07T00:12:48Z;Copper nears $6,000 a tonne on low stocks;;Copper prices have hit record highs almost daily over the past two weeks, getting close to an unprecedented $6,000 a tonne, double the average price of two years ago, and creating a situation some followers of the red metal label a “super spike”.CRU, the London-based metals consultancy, says that with global inventories at very low levels of about two weeks of demand, the market will be unable to weather any further supply disruptions – there have been production problems in Indonesia and Mexico in the past month – without continued price rises.Some mining groups are concerned this will lead users to find substitute materials, particularly in the construction industry. Copper is also used in the electronics, auto and power sectors.The benchmark three-month copper price closed at a record $5,778 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange on Thursday. Copper has risen four-fold since November 2001 and has been at the forefront of the four-year surge in industrial metals prices.Peter Kettle, base metals analyst for CRU, said the rally had been triggered by a string of supply problems, including a landslide at the Grasberg copper and gold mine that killed three people on March 23. The Indonesian mine, operated by Freeport McMoran of the US, is the world’s second largest.Meanwhile, miners at Grupo Mexico’s La Caridad copper mine were on their 12th day of strikes, halting output at the 140,000 tonnes a year mine.Mr Kettle told a copper conference in Santiago that supply disruptions would mean demand outstripping supply in the second quarter, leading to a further fall in global inventories that were already at critically low levels.CRU sees global copper inventories falling by 107,000 tonnes in the three months to June 30, from around 460,000 tonnes. That would follow a drop in global copper stockpiles last year of 153,000 tonnes and an 844,000 tonne decline in 2004.Ingrid Sternby, a metals analyst at Barclays Capital, said she was likely to raise her price forecast for copper, possibly to above $6,000 a tonne.The “super spike” scenario was put forward last year by Goldman Sachs, referring to the oil market in a situation in which stocks are low and supply cannot be increased, leading prices to jump to a level that deters consumption. “This is where we are today in copper,” Mr Kettle said.
440;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2006-02-07T00:15:23Z;Indonesia to change security pay rules;;Indonesia plans to revise guidelines governing the relationship between its military and foreign companies for which its soldiers provide security in conflict areas, the country’s defence minister said yesterday.The move follows renewed allegations surrounding Freeport McMoRan and its relationship with the Indonesian military in remote Papua province, where the New Orleans-based miner operates the world’s largest gold and copper mine.Recent reports that Freeport has made millions of dollars in payments to individual military officers have prompted calls for investigations from Indonesia and the US, with some alleging the company may have violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Freeport has denied any wrongdoing.Juwono Sudarsono, Indonesia’s defence minister, said yesterday the allegations had prompted a review in Jakarta of the guidelines governing relationships such as Freeport’s with the military. He said new guidelines could be issued within weeks. The government was considering a change that would require all companies to funnel payments to the military through a local partner or government agency, he told reporters.Indonesian law requires resource projects deemed to be of national importance, such as Freeport’s Grasberg mine and ExxonMobil’s Arun gas field in Aceh, to be guarded by security forces.Soldiers’ meagre salaries have meant companies such as Freeport often supplement them or provide barracks, food, and other compensation. In some cases the practice has led to awkward relationships between companies and the military.
441;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2005-12-28T21:41:28Z;Wall St rallies on consumer confidence;;Wall Street staged a gentle rally on Wednesday, lifted by news of higher-than-expected improvement in consumer confidence in December and a late surge in holiday spending.The signs of strength in the US economy trumped concern among investors about an inversion of the treasury yield curve.For a second consecutive day, yields on 10-year US Treasury briefly dipped below those on two-year paper. The inversion has historically heralded the start of a slowdown in the US economy. But in contrast to Tuesday’s frenzied sell-off, investors appeared unfazed by the renewed convergence.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session 0.2 per cent higher at 10,796.26, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both ticked up 1 per cent to 1,258.17 and 2,228.94 respectively.Energy stocks, which rebounded along with crude prices, helped keep the Dow afloat. The Amex oil index gained 1.6 per cent, while the energy-price-sensitive Amex airline index dropped 2.4 per cent.Gold companies also advanced after the price of bullion hit a two-week high. Newmont Mining, the world’s biggest gold producer, climbed 3.5 per cent to $53.40 while Freeport-McMoRan Cooper & Gold, owner of the world’s biggest gold mine, rose 2.6 per cent to $54.88.On the Nasdaq, gains in eBay, up 1.4 per cent at $44.37, helped offset losses in Apple Computers. Shares in the iPod maker, which have seen intense demand this year, pulled back 0.9 per cent to $73.57 on valuation concerns. Elsewhere, retailers were in focus after the International Council of Shopping Centers said US retail chains’ same-store sales rose 2.8 per cent last week.However, Target dashed shareholders’ hopes for a robust holiday sales season after it said December same-store sales only rose in line with previous guidance. Its shares dipped 0.1 per cent to $55.55. Meanwhile, rival Wal-Mart advanced 0.2 per cent to $47.84.By contrast, Linens ’n Things, the home furnishing retailer, surged 10.9 per cent to $26.52 on news that the private equity firm Apollo Capital Management was preparing to complete its acquisition of the company.Albertson’s, the grocery chain, climbed 1.3 per cent to $21.10 after JPMorgan upgraded its rating on the stock. The broker said that the collapse of takeover talks last week would open the door for shareholder activists.Drugmaker Celgene jumped 5.9 per cent to $60.85 after the Food and Drug Administration approved its anaemia drug Revlimid.AstraZeneca, the UK’s second largest drugmaker, traded up 0.9 per cent to $48.85 after it signed a $300m research and licensing agreement with Targacept to develop and market an experimental treatment for Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia.
442;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2005-11-29T20:39:03Z;Gold tops $500 first time since 1980s;;Metals markets enjoyed an exceptional day on Tuesday, with copper, aluminium, zinc and lead all hitting fresh multi-year highs while gold and platinum broke through psychologically important levels.“The newsflow has been very supportive for base metals today with positive US economic data and specific reports of copper production shortfalls,” said Ingrid Sternby, metals analyst at Barclays Capital.US consumer confidence saw its largest jump since 2003 in November as gasoline prices fell while new home sales hit a record in October. US orders for durable goods rose in October.Negative supply news boosted prices. Freeport-McMoRan said copper and gold production from its Indonesian mine was below expectations for the fourth quarter because of disappointing ore quality. Chile reported a fall of about 6 per cent in copper production in October compared with a year ago. Dealers said the market was nervous over China, fearing large-scale deliveries against a short position in copper.“The copper price remains in its relentless uptrend, still supported by the combination of low inventories, supply disruptions and robust demand,” Ms Sternby said.Three-month copper contracts hit $4,260 a tonne in the afternoon at the London Metal Exchange before settling at $4,231 a tonne at the end of open-outcry trading.Speculative demand also boosted aluminium, zinc and lead. Aluminium peaked at $2,132.50 a tonne, the highest price since February 1995. It was up $15 from Monday.Zinc hit a fresh 15-year high of $1,705 a tonne, up $15 from Monday. Lead climbed $9 to $1,026, the highest price since the contract started trading in dollars in 1993.In precious metals, gold climbed above $500 a troy ounce, and platinum above $1,000 an ounce. Gold was supported by strong buying from private Japanese investors, while platinum continued to benefit from tight a market. Gold peaked in morning trading at $502.30 a troy ounce, its highest level since December 1987. In the afternoon, it retreated to $496.90/$497.70 a troy ounce.Platinum peaked at $1,002, a new 26-year high, but eased to $992 an ounce in late afternoon trading.Silver fell 11 cents from Monday’s 20-month high, ending at $8.25 a troy ounce.British prompt gas prices rose sharply as supply dropped on talk of offshore production problems. Prices stayed well below last week’s record levels. Within the day delivery gained 14 pence to 115 pence a therm, with a day ahead delivery at 104 pence a therm.Oil fell prior to the release today of US petroleum data, which is expected to show increasing stocks of distillates and petrol. London Brent crude for January delivery closed 56 cents down at $54.32 a barrel, after falling more than $1 on Monday. January West Texas Intermediate settled at $56.50 a barrel, down 86 cents.
443;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2005-11-29T19:06:35Z;Supply concerns push copper to new peak;;Copper prices peaked again on Wednesday on supply concerns following a fall in Chilean production of the metal and on news that Grasberg, the world’s second largest copper mine, would not meet its targeted output because of lower ore grades.The benchmark three-month copper price peaked at $4,260 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange, up $36 on the day, and about 35 per cent higher so far this year.Chile, the world’s biggest copper miner, recorded a 6.3 per cent fall in copper output in October compared with the same month last year, according to government statistics. Chilean copper output is down 2.9 per cent in the first 10 months of the year.Meanwhile, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold said fourth-quarter copper production from the Grasberg mine in Indonesia was five per cent below target.Copper supply concerns outweighed a fall in copper imports into China, the world’s largest consumer of the metal. China imported 55,546 tonnes of copper in October, its lowest import level in 18 months and down from 94,577 tonnes in September.Chinese copper consumption has risen this year, while demand has fallen in the US, Japan and Europe.China will remain in focus for the copper market on Wednesday, with the State Reserve Bureau due to hold an auction to sell 20,000 tonnes of copper. The SRB, which is at the centre of market speculation that it has a net short position in copper of up to 200,000 tonnes, has held auctions for the sale of 40,000 tonnes of copper this month.The auctions are helping to damp Chinese copper prices, with benchmark copper futures on the Shanghai Futures Exchange trading at a near $500 discount to the benchmark LME copper price.Traders said that a large net short position in the market remains. However, it is understood that the LCH.Clearnet, the clearing house, has not had to make any extra margin calls to LME member firms trading in copper over the past fortnight since the story about SRB’s possible short position was first reported.Each LME member firm, which includes brokers and investment banks, has an account with LCH.Clearnet where it deposits funds to cover any potential losses on a trade. It is understood that these funds have been sufficient and that there have been no calls for additional funds. Earlier this month, LCH.Clearnet reduced the size of the margin call on copper trading from $256 a tonne to $202.
444;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2005-02-22T18:39:32Z;Mines dig deep for decent legacy;;"The controversy that for many years surrounded an Indonesian gold and copper mine operated by Freeport-McMoRan highlights many of the thorny issues faced by the mining industry. With millions of tons of debris generated by the Papua mine, Freeport has frequently been criticised by environmental campaigners.But another aspect of the mine - the fate of local communities after its eventual closure - is also proving hard for many mining companies to resolve. Not far from Freeport's Papua pits, for example, the once tiny village of Timika is now a small city.""The problem is that companies don't get to choose where projects are, and they tend to be in the most depressed parts of the poorest countries,"" says Tim Mclaughlin, a consultant who has worked with both Freeport and Denver-based Newmont Mining. ""And when you become the economic and social engine in an area, you attract people.""The question for companies is how to ensure people attracted to the area continue to have livelihoods after mining operations have ceased. Shaun Stewart, international and government affairs adviser at Rio Tinto, the mining group, says: ""We see it as a responsibility of ours that, when the mine closes down, we don't just leave a big hole in the ground - we leave a community that can sustain itself.""One way in which the economic benefits of the mining business could be spread is through infrastructure development. The idea, says Mark Moody Stuart, chairman of Anglo American, is that when a mining company is developing the roads or ports associated with its business, its contractors could also develop infrastructure with wider use.Another answer is to foster businesses that can continue after mining operations have disappeared. This means sourcing locally wherever possible.Sir Mark cites the example of Anglo's operations in South Africa. ""We have in the mines a company that started off by maintaining in-mine rail equipment,"" he says. ""And they grow and go out and get non-mining business, so you're building capacity that originates in mining, but then is applicable to other areas of the economy.""To encourage these businesses, the Anglo Zimele initiative - established by Anglo American in South Africa - provides loans to small businesses.Such approaches are not limited to the developing world. At Rio Tinto's Flambeau copper mine in Wisconsin, local businesses hoping to provide goods and services to the company were asked to produce a business plan demonstrating their sustainability beyond the life of the mine.Elsewhere, a research project by the International Council on Mining and Metals, which represents mining companies and associations, is examining how mineral wealth could be harnessed to reduce poverty and spread economic growth in developing countries. Focusing on Ghana and Peru, the project will identify ""success factors"" and highlight lessons for companies, non- governmental organisations, governments and others.Yet some NGOs suggest that companies should not meddle in such areas at all. Others point to the danger that such initiatives create yet another layer of dependence for communities.However, Mr Stewart believes such concerns can be addressed by consulting communities before starting development projects and by forming partnerships with local authorities and NGOs. ""What we're always trying to do is hook the provincial government in,"" he says. Rio Tinto, he adds, might pay for the construction and equipping of a clinic and fund training for nurses, ""but their salaries are paid by the government"".However, some critics still believe corporate initiatives do not go far enough. ""Mining companies have to be more transparent about the long-term impact of their operations,"" says Keith Slack, a senior policy adviser at Oxfam America. ""They also have to build relations with the communities or they're going to have problems down the road - and that will start to impact the bottom line.""For the previous article in this series click here"
445;FCX;Freeport-Mcmoran Inc;2004-10-07T16:19:18Z;Copper nears 10-year high as funds wade in;;Copper prices surged to near 10-year highs on Thursday, spurred by renewed hedge fund appetite for commodities on the back of record oil prices. Lower inventory levels were also having an impact at a time when demand, particularly from China, remains strong.The higher metal price lifted mining shares across the globe. BHP Billiton and Xstrata both hit new all-time highs, up 2.4 per cent to 619p and 1.7 per cent to 940p respectively. Chilean copper miner Antofagasta rose to a seven-month high, up 2.7 per cent to 1170p while Rio Tinto's 0.8 per cent rise to £15.82 saw it hit its best level since January. In North America, Phelps Dodge, the world's largest listed copper producer, also hit an all-time, up 0.7 per cent to $96.00 and Freeport-McMoran was at its best level since March, up 2 per cent at $41.83.Over the last month metal markets have returned to favour with investors, who dumped metals in the spring following moves by the Chinese government to slow down its rapidly growing economy.“There has been a marked increase in the level of investor activity in metals recently, although the fundamentals of the market have not altered,” said Stephen Briggs, metals economist at Societe Generale.“Investors appear to be attracted to metals because it is a commodity like oil. So people think that if the oil price is going up, metal prices must go up,” he said.The three-month copper price peaked at $3,065 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange yesterday, exceeding the August 1995 high by $2 and putting it within sight of the January 1995 level of $3,075. If this level is broken, copper prices will be at their highest since the late 1980s when copper prices were more than $3,300 a tonne or $1.50 a lb, a level considered the top of a bull market cycle.Mr Briggs said he expected copper and other base metal prices to remain near relative high levels well into 2005 as market conditions remain tight due to mine production failing to keep pace with demand, which in turn has led to a rapid fall in global copper inventories.He said copper inventories on the London Metal Exchange have fallen from 850,000 tonnes at the end of 2002 to 94,000 at present, while stockpiles on the Comex exchange in New York have dwindled from 360,000 to about 37,000 over the same period.John Meyer, mining analyst at Numis, said including inventories for the Shanghai metal exchange, total volumes of copper stored in exchange warehouses were 156,995 tonnes, representing under 3.5 days worth of demand based on demand levels in the first half of the year.Mr Meyer said mine capacity utilisation rates have risen from 89 per cent at the beginning of the year to 93 per cent in June, close to the 94 per cent peak utilisation seen in recent years.Numis estimates each 1 per cent rise in mine utilisation rates adds a further 166,000 tonnes of copper to the market.“This may not be sufficient to return the market to a supply/demand balance next year and the drive to gain greater utilisation of mine capacity could put some mines at increasing risk of strikes and catastrophic failure as was seen at Grasberg,” he said.Production at the Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia is projected to rise significantly in the second half of this year as it recovers from a landslide that halted output at the mine last year.Adding to the current price rise is the threat of industrial action at mines in Chile and Peru. Codelco, the world's largest copper producer which is owned by the Chilean government, said a strike is likely today (**Friday**) at its largest unit, as the deadline for contract negotiations looms with no agreement in sight.
