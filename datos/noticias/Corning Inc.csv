2;GLW;Corning Inc;2017-05-12T16:56:53Z;Apple invests $200m in iPhone glassmaker Corning;Supplier is first beneficiary of $1bn fund to promote US manufacturing jobs;Apple made the first investment from its new $1bn US “advanced manufacturing” fund into the multibillion-dollar company that has provided the iPhone’s glass screen for the last decade. Corning, a public company with a market capitalisation of $26bn that was founded more than 165 years ago, will receive $200m from Apple to help develop its facility in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Gorilla Glass, Corning’s hardened material that was put into production to supply the first iPhone in 2007, is manufactured in Kentucky, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, according to the company’s website. Corning also has facilities around the world including Mexico and China, as well as the US.Apple’s investment will be focused on research and development and capital investments in Kentucky, in the hopes of benefiting its own products while also making Corning more competitive in a global market. Corning’s shares were up less than 1 per cent on Friday morning at $29.04, while Apple stock hit a new record intraday high at $156.42, giving it a valuation of $817bn. Apple’s pledge to invest at least $1bn to stimulate American jobs and manufacturing, which was announced last week, came after criticism from President Trump during last year’s election campaign that it was so reliant on overseas manufacturing for the iPhone and its other products. In an interview with the New York Times last November, Mr Trump said he told Apple chief Tim Cook that “one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.”Apple’s press release announcing the Corning investment on Friday said its new fund is “designed to foster innovative production and highly skilled jobs that will help lay the foundation for a new era of technology-driven manufacturing in the US”. Although its first deployment from that fund is a substantial sum to an established supplier, Apple has not ruled out making smaller investments in larger numbers of earlier-stage companies in the future. In a report on its US employment and economic impact last week, Apple said that it supported 2m jobs across more than 9,000 American suppliers and manufacturers, with whom it spends $50bn a year. Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said on Friday that Corning “is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate”. “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America,” Mr Williams said. According to his biographer Walter Isaacson, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs managed to persuade Corning to ramp up production of Gorilla Glass for the first iPhone within just six months, an unusually short lead time for complex manufacturing. Wendell Weeks, Corning’s chairman and chief executive, had persuaded Jobs to use glass instead of plastic for the face of the iPhone. When he protested that producing so much in such a short space of time was impossible, Jobs reportedly stared at him intensely and replied: “Yes, you can do it . . . Get your mind around it. You can do it.” The anecdote is often cited as an example of Jobs’ “reality distortion field” and his ability to push people to greater levels of performance. It also points to the often extreme demands that Apple makes of its suppliers. “Corning’s longstanding relationship with Apple has not only led to significant glass innovations that have enabled new capabilities for consumers, it has also helped create nearly 1,000 American jobs and allowed us to continue growing and expanding in the US,” Mr Weeks said in Friday’s statement. “This investment will ensure our plant in Harrodsburg remains a global centre of excellence for glass technology.”Despite the warm words surrounding the two companies’ latest collaboration, it is only a few years since Apple tried to switch away from Corning to a new US-based supplier, GT Advanced Technology, that could have seen the iPhone’s faceplate being made of sapphire instead of glass. In late 2013, Apple loaned GT $578m to help it set up a sapphire manufacturing facility in Arizona, as part of a deal fuelled by local tax breaks. However, less than a year in to what was supposed to be a five-year partnership, GT had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, bemoaning its “oppressive and burdensome” supplier agreement with Apple. GT and Apple eventually reached a settlement in 2015. The Arizona facility that had been earmarked to produce sapphire is now being turned into an Apple data centre. According to a US regulatory filing published in January of this year, Apple is also looking to use the facility to “produce certain components for consumer electronics”, including server cabinets.

Securing the required volume of optical fibre and hardware solutions with Corning will ensure we meet our planned rollout schedules.”Corning executive vice-president Clark Kinlin added:“We are pleased that Verizon recognizes the value of Corning’s innovative solutions in deploying next-generation converged optical infrastructure, such as One Fiber, more quickly and cost effectively. Verizon’s purchase commitment supports necessary capacity investments across our manufacturing footprint.”Verizon shares were holding flat after the announcement, while Corning shares are up 2.5 per cent.

It is a solid that allows the passage of rays through it — demanding that they sparkle, reflect and refract. Without glass, there is no contemporary architecture. There are no car windscreens, no TVs, no microscopes or lenses, no smartphones. No modern world.Because of the interaction between glass and light, a museum of the material can be something very different to a museum of art. Indeed the new wing for the Corning Museum of Glass in upstate New York is a pure expression of that relationship, an opalescent light box and an elegant new addition to an unusual corporate campus.Emerging from a town once dominated by the smoking, cigar-shaped brick chimneys of its old glassworks, today, the museum is the world’s largest institution dedicated to glass.Though most of the manufacture of the material is now taken care of elsewhere, the company headquarters and adjacent museum have between them become a kind of larger museum of US postwar Modernism.The history of the buildings begins in 1951 with Wallace Harrison’s black, glass-clad headquarters, an almost classical set of façades alongside his low-slung glass-brick museum building. It continues with the subsequent addition of Bohlin Cywinski Jackson’s transparent research facility in 2001 — the techniques of which would later be applied to the glass stairs now so familiar as the lingua franca of Apple stores.But the new $65m building, designed by New York-based Thomas Phifer (and funded by Corning Inc) is something else again. A white glass box punctuated by huge, translucent windows, it has a milky opalescence that is almost the inverse of Harrison’s obsidian structure.It is only a single-storey building, yet it exerts an enigmatic presence on the landscape, picking up the grey of the clouds and the glint of the sun. The interior, however, is something very different; a curious disavowal of the box in which it sits. The walls wave and curve inside, wrapping themselves around the exhibits — the huge works of art in glass that had proved so difficult to display in the old building.The architect’s intention is clearly to allow the visit to wander, rather than to dictate a route; the internal arrangement creates a languorous looseness, and visitors seem to dissipate in the interior. The works here are wonderful, unfamiliar and moving in their mix of the delicacy of the material and the intensity of purpose.Katherine Gray’s seemingly oddly-arranged, thrift-shop and flea-market drinking glasses, for example, coalesce into the shape of three trees as you move further away, their browns and greens merging into trunks and foliage, a comment on the deforestation associated with the glass industry.A mile-long black rope by Liza Lou reveals itself to be a meticulously beaded work of almost fanatical density, coiled like a snake on the floor. But most powerful of all are the monumental cast works by Czech artists, particularly Stanislav Libenský and Jaroslava Brychtová, one of which appears to depict a pair of grey human lungs encased in a massive block of glass and which, from another angle, seems to form the wings of an angel — a work crafted when Libenský was diagnosed with lung cancer.If this ethereal space, with its embrace of soft white walls, is the yang, its yin appears right behind it. One of the gallery’s sides is characterised by what has been called the “promenade”, a broad internal avenue that provides a way through to one of the museum’s star attractions, the hot glass shows where glassmakers demonstrate their techniques. Huge, dark and resolutely industrial, this space is continued within the bones of the former Steuben Glass Works, an art glassmaker that was once a competitor of Tiffany and which was acquired by Corning in 1918.With raked seating and dramatic glass processes, it makes clear the closeness of contemporary theatre to industrial space. It is an imposing space made yet more surprising by its following on from such a white, pure approach. From the outside, the contrast is clearer, the black, corrugated metal-clad surfaces of the former Steuben works recalling its smoke-stained industrial past.In the midst of the museum’s collection is a curious object, a window shutter in which the slats are made of yellow and green glass. This had been the big idea, the product on which the glass company’s move to Corning in the mid-19th century was predicated.It was a complete failure (presumably because it didn’t stop the light coming in — the one thing blinds are supposed to do). Yet Corning did subsequently make its reputation with everything from Pyrex to Gorilla Glass (now used on iPhones), and the town, with its wonderfully preserved main street, was formed and shaped by it.This is a very particular institution, one that unifies the concerns of contemporary museology, enveloping in one place art, craft, science, popular culture, manufacture, and the biggest, kitschiest museum store I have ever seen. In uniting populism (and genuine popularity) and deep scholarly engagement, it achieves the ultimate aim of the modern museum. Antique glass of the most exquisite quality appears under one roof with a 21-tonne casting for the lens of the Hale telescope.And all this is encapsulated by an architecture of glass, which captures the essence of the material of modernity.cmog.orgPhotographs: Iwan Baan/Corning Museum of Glass…"
5;GLW;Corning Inc;2014-10-07T17:43:07Z;GTAT: all too breakable;Sapphire screen dreams shatter;"Steve Jobs loved glass. For the first iPhone, he personally persuaded the head of Corning to make millions of tough “gorilla glass” screens at very short notice, even though it had not made gorilla glass in years.Apple’s focus on screens has endured – but the success of its screen makers has not. The latest version of the iPhone was expected to use sapphire (rather than glass) screens. But GT Advanced Technologies, which partnered with Apple last year to build the biggest sapphire factory in the world, has filed for bankruptcy. Once a $3bn market capitalisation company, it is now worth under $200m.The story of GTAT illustrates why Apple’s margins are so fat and those of its suppliers are so thin. Before Apple, GTAT struggled as a designer of photovoltaic equipment looking for a new lease of life. It had never manufactured sapphire before, but it had a small business designing sapphire furnaces and it needed to diversify. So a deal with Apple to make sapphire must have looked too good to pass up: Apple would even provide a $580m prepayment (basically a loan) to fund the factory’s start-up costs.The prepayment was attached to capacity targets – and could even be clawed back under certain circumstances. Apple did not guarantee a purchase volume but it did wrangle an exclusivity commitment from GTAT, which stopped selling furnaces to its regular customers to focus on the factory.For GTAT, Apple’s lifeline turned out to be nothing of the sort. The iPhones did not use sapphire screens after all; the Watch does, but in smaller quantities. Revenues in the first half of 2014 fell by a third, while operating losses widened to $140m. GTAT’s sales of sapphire fell behind schedule through the summer, says UBS. And the last tranche of Apple’s prepayment never came through.Neither company will say what happened – perhaps a manufacturing snag was to blame. Then GTAT filed for bankruptcy. Sapphire may be the second-hardest mineral on the planet, but life as an Apple supplier can break just about anybody.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex"

They closed down 4.5 per cent at $18.74.Skyworks Solutions, the maker of radio components used in the iPhone and iPad, fell as much as 4.5 per cent on opening, and closed down about 1 per cent at $30.05. Peregrine Semiconductor shares were 3.3 per cent weaker.Apple shares tumbled almost 8 per cent to $506.50 after it sold fewer iPhones than forecast in the last quarter, raising fears that demand for the best-selling product might be slowly ebbing. The company sold 51m iPhones in the last three months of 2013, trailing the almost 55m sales Wall Street had expected.Pharmaceutical company Pfizer led the charge on the Dow Jones industrial index, climbing 2.5 per cent to $30.42. Despite reporting a drop in profits and sales last quarter, Pfizer shares were buoyed by an improving outlook for this year. The company forecast sales of between $49.2bn and $51.2bn, better than the $49.5bn expected by analysts.There was encouragement for investors in the US homebuilding sector. Shares of D.R. Horton surged 10 per cent to $23 after the builder almost doubled profits last quarter to $123.3m and it issued a bullish outlook for the market. Shares of rival builders, including PulteGroup and Lennar, were also buoyed, up 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively.Asset manager T Rowe Price was also in demand. Its shares climbed 5.5 per cent to $80.70, as its latest quarterly results provided further evidence of how 2013’s equity rally helped companies in the asset management industry. T Rowe Price said assets under management hit a record $692.4bn.Comcast shares rose 1.6 per cent to $53.35 after the largest US cable provider posted higher fourth-quarter revenue, as it added quarterly cable video subscribers for the first time in more than six years.Royal Caribbean Cruise shares enjoyed a sector rebound, following on from Carnival, with at least two brokerages raising their price targets on the cruise operator’s stock a day after it forecast a stronger-than-expected profit for 2014 as more people signed up for cruises at higher prices in Europe and Asia.The cruise operator’s shares rose 3.4 per cent to $49.66. JPMorgan raised its price target on the stock from $50 to $53, while Investec raised its price target from $53 to $56. Both maintained their ratings on the stock.Corning shares tumbled 6 per cent to $17.10 after the speciality glassmaker said LCD glass prices would decline further in the current quarter, raising concerns about the growth prospects of its television display business, which brings in more than a third of the company’s revenue.Struggling teen apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch gained just under 5 per cent to $36.27. It said that it had separated the roles of chairman and chief executive officer and abandoned a plan aimed at blocking hostile buyout bids.Cliffs Natural Resources shares ended up 2 per cent higher at $19.81 after New York-based hedge fund Casablanca Capital picked up a 5.2 per cent stake in the iron ore producer and urged it to spin off international assets and double its annual dividend.In an overall stock market rebound on Tuesday morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was poised for its first day of gains since January 17.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 90.68 points or 0.57 per cent, to end at 15,928.56. The S&P 500 gained 10.94 points or 0.61 per cent, to finish at 1,792.50. The Nasdaq Composite added 14.35 points or 0.35 per cent, to close at 4,097.96.Additional reporting by Reuters

But it pared losses later when the Federal Open Market Committee said interest rates would stay low until late 2014, longer than previously stated.That triggered a 15 point afternoon rally for the benchmark index, but analysts were cautious about both the FOMC meeting and prospects for the bull market.“It’s clear the make-up of the Fed board has become more dovish and it will do what it can to inoculate the US economy from global problems,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist with Prudential Financial. “On the other hand, the Fed is acknowledging that US growth will be substandard, which can’t be good for equities.”Apple had earlier briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as shares surged following Tuesday’s blockbuster results.Shares closed up 6.2 per cent at $446.66, having hit an all-time high of $454.45 at the open.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index to gain 1.1 per cent to 2,818.31, and triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.Qualcomm, which manufactures microchips used in the iPhone 4S, climbed 0.6 per cent to $59.00, as analysts at JPMorgan said: “Apple’s very strong numbers give us more confidence that Qualcomm should report strong numbers and guide well in its earnings report next Wednesday.”Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, climbed 3.1 per cent to $6.73, despite opening sharply lower after cutting full-year guidance. But Nvidia, which hopes to supply the next generation of Macs, fell 0.6 per cent to $14.85 after reducing fourth-quarter sales projections.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,758.85, lagging other indicesGoldman Sachs fell 0.5 per cent to $108.31, and Morgan Stanley was off 0.1 per cent to $18.12, as JPMorgan analysts said a new method for calculating risk requirements, without reference to rating agencies, could reduce Goldman’s 2012 tier one capital ratio by 1.2 percentage points and Morgan Stanley’s by 0.8 percentage points.“Yet another US investment bank disadvantage,” JPMorgan said and removed “buy” recommendations on both banks.Illumina climbed 46.3 per cent to $55.15 as Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, launched a hostile bid for the diagnostics company. Roche has offered $44.50 a share in cash, but investors appear to believe Illumina will hold out for a higher price.Airlines advanced after Delta Air Lines and US Airways Group both beat projections by analysts. Delta was up 6.2 per cent to $9.96, and US Airways added 17.3 per cent to $7.52.Yahoo slipped 0.8 per cent to $15.56 despite reporting results in line with expectations. Scott Thompson, the internet portal’s chief executive, laid out new strategic plans but remained tight-lipped over plans for a sale.Boeing opened sharply lower after disappointing analysts with its 2012 forecast. But the stock closed up 0.6 per cent to $75.82.Quarterly earnings reports propelled several large moves in the S&P 500. Textron surged 14.5 per cent to $24.76 for the best performance in the index after forecasting higher 2012 profit than analysts expected, amid growing demand for its Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters.CA Inc climbed 9.6 per cent to $25.02 as the software developer easily beat analyst expectations.Xerox fell 9.9 per cent to $7.81 as it said fourth-quarter and full-year earnings could be well below analyst expectations, with slow global growth expected to hit demand for printers.Corning shed 10.7 per cent to $13.05 as the world’s largest maker of glass for flat-panel televisions saw quarterly earnings halve as LCD display prices sank.With almost a third of the S&P 500’s market capitalisation reported, companies have so far produced the lowest earnings beat-rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, with revenue gains outpacing profit increases, as margins are squeezed.“The V-shaped recovery in corporate profits seems to be at an end,” warned Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.In after-hours trading, shares in Netflix surged 10 per cent to as much as $108.00, after the DVD delivery and web streaming company reported earnings that beat expectations.

American has called time on attempts to renegotiate pension and benefit costs with pilots.Semiconductor manufacturer Corning suffered heavy selling after unexpectedly lowering fourth quarter sales guidance.The stock fell 10.8 per cent to $13.19, as the company said sales of a major LCD screen product will rise only 5 to 10 per cent quarter on quarter, compared to prior guidance of a 20 per cent sequential rise.Hospira fell 9.1 per cent to $28.17 after RBC Capital Markets said a long running Food and Drug Administration investigation into the medical device marker’s main manufacturing plant may cause “widespread” production breakdowns, and take two to three years to correct.Netflix fell 3.4 per cent to $67.57 after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the company’s debt another notch, citing the risks involved in the video streaming website’s capital intensive overseas expansion.Home Depot was the standout performer in the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones. Shares rose 5.3 per cent to $38.96 after the company’s chief financial officer told an analyst breakfast meeting that November sales had been better than expected.Hard-drive manufacturers Western Digital climbed 4.7 per cent to $27.80.The company was following on the coat tails of rival Seagate Technology, which was up 3.7 per cent to $16.58, after releasing a positive update to fourth-quarter guidance, even as widespread flooding in Thailand wreaks havoc with supply chains.“[Seagate’s] guidance update was driven by increasing industry-wide prices [for hard drives] rather than anything company specific,” said Joe Yoo at Citigroup.Mr Yoo said rising prices should reduce Western Digital’s fourth quarter net loss to roughly $150m, compared to the company’s most recent guidance of $300m.Banks gave back some of their gains from Monday’s rally.Morgan Stanley fell 3.6 per cent to $13.31, leaving the investment bank up just 0.4 per cent for the week, significantly underperforming the S&P 500, which is up almost 3 per cent.Bank of America was down 3.2 per cent to $5.08, after touching a new year low of $5.03 during the day.But Nomura analyst Brian Foran gave bank executives some cheer, arguing retrenchment by European lenders from the US markets could benefit midsize US banks.“This creates an opportunity for US banks such as US Bancorp, PNC and Wells Fargo who are big enough to serve large corporate borrowers and are now able to replace Europeans as they pull out,” Mr Foran wrote to clients.PNC was up 1.2 per cent to $50.83.
9;GLW;Corning Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
10;GLW;Corning Inc;2011-08-11T17:56:40Z;Chief executives buy shares to show belief in businesses;;North American chief executives and their senior managers are buying their companies’ shares on a scale not seen since March 2009.The heads of Morgan Stanley, Chiquita Brands, General Motors and the holding company of United Airlines and Continental are among those who in the past week have sought to demonstrate confidence in their companies through share purchases.Other influential insider buyers have included James Flaws, Corning’s veteran chief financial officer, and Lou Simpson, a confidant of Warren Buffett and now a director of Chesapeake Energy, a big natural gas producer.Heavy insider purchases often portend a vigorous market rally. Given their knowledge of their own companies, executives can spot valuation anomalies in the market.Ben Silverman, research director at New Jersey-based InsiderScore, which tracks insider trades, said that “in the past 30 years, there has been no time when the market bottomed and rallied when it wasn’t preceded by a critical mass of insider buying”.At the start of trading on Thursday, companies in the S&P 500 were priced at 11.3 times forecast profits, near the cheapest since March 2009, according to Bloomberg data.Mr Silverman said that “most of these guys are in it for the long haul”, saying that securities laws generally required insiders to hold their shares for at least six months.Roger Martin, dean of the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, added that as an investor “it’s about the only thing I would pay attention to. [Insiders] just have way better information.”While executives may have unrivalled knowledge of their own companies, Mr Martin noted that they, like other investors, can be blindsided by two hard-to-predict factors: political and macro-economic developments, and the market’s expectation of performance, rather than the performance itself.Mr Silverman said that insiders had been more bullish twice in the past eight years than they are now – in March 2009, when a strong rally ensued, but also in November 2008, which turned out to be a false bottom.Even so, Mr Silverman contrasts the $2.1m invested by Morgan Stanley’s James Gorman with the more modest $173,000 spent by United Continental’s Jeff Smisek. “The question is, is there a lot of conviction behind the buying or is it just public relations?” he asks.Few insiders have demonstrated more conviction than the chief executive and several directors and managers of Montreal-based Yellow Media, Canada’s biggest provider of online services by revenues.They have plunged into the market during the past week, just days after the company reported a loss, slashed its dividend by three-quarters and had its credit rating downgraded to junk status.Marc Tellier, Yellow Media’s chief executive, who bought C$142,000 worth of stock on Monday, said: “The market has its concerns but the market is not always right”.Additional reporting by Jeremy Lemer and Anjli Raval
11;GLW;Corning Inc;2011-07-27T20:54:23Z;Wall Street lower amid default fears;;US stocks fell on Wednesday, accelerating losses sustained this week as investors grew increasingly apprehensive about the absence of a deal from Washington over raising the debt ceiling and averting a US default.Global markets were in a “risk-off” mode, given the impasse in Washington, with Wall Street unable to gain impetus from good earnings results, led by Boeing and Dow Chemical.A proposal by the Republican party to raise the debt ceiling has been delayed until Thursday, as the plan faces a possible conservative mutiny.“It now seems clear that the market has the whole DC debt limit debate exactly wrong,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group. “It’s not that the market will rally after Congress and the president reach an agreement. It’s that there won’t be an agreement until the stock market tanks.”The S&P 500 dropped 2 per cent to 1,304.89.Of the 10 main S&P industry groups, technology was the biggest loser with a drop of 2.95 per cent, followed by industrials, down 2.7 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.7 per cent to 2,764.79 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.6 per cent at 12,302.55.In a sign that nervousness and uncertainty was growing, the Vix, an indicator of future volatility, rose 13 per cent and touched its highest level since March.However, Dunkin’ Brands, which listed on Nasdaq, jumped 47 per cent to $28.85 in its first of trading day. The company has raised $422.75m after pricing its initial public offering at $19 a share, higher than the range of $16 to $18 set by underwriters.Corning said its second-quarter profits dropped 17 per cent, as the speciality glass maker was hit by a higher tax rate, while its supply of liquid crystal display glass was disrupted by Japan’s earthquake and tsunami in March. Its shares fell 7.2 per cent to $16.04.Shares in Juniper Networks, a network equipment maker, plunged 21 per cent to $24.66 after the company reported disappointing results for the second quarter. Juniper also warned that the “outlook for the September quarter reflects some near-term market weakness”.But shares in Amazon were up 3.9 per cent at $222.52, after the online retailer reported higher revenues but lower profits late on Tuesday. The company still beat estimates.Boeing reported a 20 per cent rise in second-quarter profits and upgraded its outlook for 2011, lifting its earnings per share guidance to between $3.90 and $4.10.Shares in the aircraft maker rose 0.7 per cent to $70.63, after its net income rose to $941m, compared with $787m in the second quarter of 2010.Dow Chemical reported a 74 per cent rise in profits to 84 cents a share on sales of $16bn, which beat analysts’ estimates, and the company also announced the sale of its polypropylene unit. Its shares lost 2.4 per cent to $34.99.Ford, a day after reporting a 7.7 per cent drop in earnings from a year ago, was planning to sell a benchmark 10-year debt issue. The stock was down 4.4 per cent at $12.37.Shares in WellPoint dropped 6.6 per cent to $68.70, after the company reported better-than-expected results and warned of rising costs for its Medicare plans for seniors.The US debt debate “is weighing on markets but so is the weaker-than-expected durable goods report”, said Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital. “We may be faced with a US downgrade but what we will definitely be faced with is weak economic growth.”Data on US second-quarter gross domestic product growth will be released on Friday.Durable goods orders for June fell 2.1 per cent, weaker than the expected rise of 0.3 per cent. Orders excluding transportation rose 0.1 per cent, and were also below estimates.“Manufacturing has lost momentum in recent months and it is hard to place all the blame on knock-on effects from Japanese supply chain disruptions,” said analysts at RDQ Economics.They added: “Motor vehicles have played a very significant part in the drop in durable goods orders over the past three months, as total durable goods orders have fallen at an annualised rate of 10.4 per cent since March, while orders of motor vehicles and parts have fallen at a more rapid pace of 23 per cent.”
12;GLW;Corning Inc;2011-04-19T19:29:33Z;Apple lawsuit deemed no threat to supply;;Apple’s lawsuit against one of its most critical suppliers, Samsung Electronics, does not mean that the complex relationship that lies behind two hit technology products is in immediate jeopardy, people with knowledge of the situation have told the FT.The suit filed on Friday in a California federal court accuses Samsung, in its smartphones and Galaxy Tab tablet, of apeing the appearance of Apple’s iPhone and iPad, for which another arm of the South Korean manufacturer supplies chips and storage.But Apple has locked in long-term supply deals with Samsung and neither side would benefit from breaking that connection.In spite of recent angry comments by Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, about Samsung “copycats” and inflammatory language used in the suit, Apple has few immediate alternatives for securing custom-made supplies on the scale it needs, analysts said.For its part, Samsung said it planned unspecified legal retaliation and would defend itself in court.Indeed, executives at the world’s biggest technology company by sales say it initially planned the Galaxy smartphone to look like a giant water droplet.Only three months before starting production, Samsung was still jointly working with US glass company Corning to give the Galaxy a curved screen, imitating the surface tension on a puddle of water. The plan was that the screen should even make a plopping sound like a falling raindrop when it was touched.But Lee Don-joo, executive vice-president of Samsung’s mobile division, said he had to abandon the aquatic concept as the targeted production of 1m Galaxy handsets a month meant it would not be commercially viable.It was launched with a flat screen last June.In its suit, Apple has identified several features other than screens that it says “slavishly” mimic the look and feel of iPhone smartphones and iPad tablets. In its 38-page filing, photographs of the Galaxy and iPhone are compared like exhibits from a crime scene.Apple has required repeated assurances that details of its chip needs are not relayed to Samsung’s mobile division, which could use them to competitive advantage. According to Samsung officials, Lee Jae-yong, the chairman’s son and heir apparent, has conducted intense negotiations with Mr Jobs to reassure him on this point.Technology analysts say the volume of supplies is so large that Samsung sells some components at better rates to Apple than it does to its own mobile division.A public spat between the groups could lead to Apple seeking to replace the Samsung-made chip in the iPad 2 with processor chips from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, analysts argue.But they add that Apple would also run big risks to its supply chain by shunning Samsung.Most analysts believe there is little chance TSMC could develop sufficient capacity to challenge Samsung’s chips this year. But Randy Abrams, analyst at Credit Suisse, has suggested the Taiwanese company could supply Apple in 2012.Still, switching chip supplier could have hazards for Apple. One analyst, who declined to be named, said Samsung and Apple had jointly developed processor chips. This meant Samsung could sue Apple if it thought chips being built by a competitor were based on its original technology.South Korean analysts said Samsung also had powerful leverage because it supplies processors as part of a package with other components, such as D-Ram memory chips. D-Ram chips are a commodity business in which Samsung is building a massive advantage over competitors through heavy investment.Lee Seung-woo, analyst at Shinyoung Securities, said Samsung’s dominance of the memory chip business meant Apple could put itself at a disadvantage by ending its supply deals.“Apple could diversify its sources in the long term, but is unlikely to do so in the short run. There is no company other than Samsung which could provide such a one-stop solution to Apple, providing memory chips …and whatever chip Apple wants,” he said.Additional reporting by Song Jung-a in Seoul
13;GLW;Corning Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Global industries consider options on supply chains;;Supply chain specialists at companies around the world are struggling to assess the extent of the disruption to their manufacturing capability amid chaos in Japan following last Friday’s earthquake.While few large businesses are admitting to any serious problems, many are examining contingency plans that could help to keep their factories around the world stocked with parts in the event that supply chains become badly affected in the next few weeks.There could be a wide-ranging impact on companies that use electronics products containing specialist, Japanese-made components, according to Stephan Wagner, a logistics expert at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.“The long-term repercussions for the world are difficult to assess but could be severe,” Mr Wagner said.“A lot of companies are worried about the potential problems that could emerge in the coming weeks,” said Toby Nichols, from PA management consultants in London.Japan is the world’s third-biggest manufacturing nation and a key producer of components for a number of industries, including automotive, construction equipment and electronics goods. A huge number of sectors from industrial control systems to mobile phones rely on electronics goods that contain at least some Japanese-made components such as flash memory, microcontrollers and parts for liquid-crystal displays used in TVs.Dale Ford, senior analyst at IHS iSuppli, a US electronics consultancy, said “significant shortages” could build up but warned the full impact would not be felt for several months.Société Générale, the French bank, said there would be “noticeable short-term disruption” to supply of goods from Japan to China’s fast-expanding industrial hubs but the impact was unlikely to be “lasting or devastating” since in many cases back-up supplies from other countries such as Taiwan or South Korea could be found.In spite of such reassurances, many industrialists confess that the outlook is worryingly uncertain.Michio Sugino, president of the Thai unit of Shinmaywa Industries, a Japanese truck manufacturer, said a number of the parent company’s suppliers in Japan had been hit by the earthquake. “Most of our parts come from Japan,” he said. “For this month we have supplies, but I cannot guarantee anything for next month.”Chi-Mei Innolux, a leading Taiwanese maker of TV and computer display panels and terminals, said there had been no impact on flat panel production, but the outlook might become more uncertain in a month or two unless output picked up in Japan.Sweden’s Ericsson, the world’s biggest maker of mobile phone networks, said it was still assessing the situation. “It is reasonable to expect that the events in Japan will affect supply of components but it is too early to say to what extent.”Much of the impact in the next week or so could come from any extended shutdown of factories in or near the earthquake zone in north-eastern Japan which have suffered little obvious damage.Many of these plants have been shut by their operators on a temporary basis while engineers check buildings and machines for potential faults caused by the tremors. Most of these are expected to open within days, assuming the situation on the ground allows.Should extended shutdowns become necessary, the impact on the supply chain would be that much greater.Possibly more disruptive are the possibilities of long-term difficulties in getting shipments of goods out of Japan due to transportation headaches such as blocked ports.Other interruptions to supplies could come from factories some way from the main earthquake and tsunami zone where production is hit by power failures.Boeing, the US aerospace company, is among many large companies trying to make sense of the situation in Japan. Its new, much-delayed 787 Dreamliner relies heavily on parts from Japanese suppliers.“We have several weeks-worth of inventory backlog, so this [the potential difficulty of shipping from Japan] will not have an immediate impact on us, [but] beyond that, it’s impossible to say,” the company said.Siemens, the big German engineering group, said there was “little impact so far” on its supply chain, while Eaton, the US industrial group, said it was “premature to speculate on the likely effects” while it was continuing to monitor the impact on suppliers to its networks of global plants.BASF of Germany, the world’s biggest chemical company, said that several of its Japanese plants had been shut down as a precaution but did not want to discuss any long-term potential impact.Corning of the US, the world’s biggest producer of the specialist glass for flat panel displays, said its two Japanese plants had suffered no impact but that it might need to find “alternative means” to cope with disruptions to transport.Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong, dismissed most of the worries.“In general, we view the risk of supply chain disruption as relatively minor, and at best temporary, and therefore of little consequence for the regional [Asia] growth outlook,” Mr Neumann said.But while many companies say they have not seen any production shortfalls, the concerns remain for many.Ryutaro Ota, Director of Sumitomo Rubber (Thailand), said he was searching for alternative supplies of speciality chemicals that normally come from Japan. “At this moment we have plenty of inventory, but if the Japanese side cannot export for the next two months we will have to stop some lines of production,” Mr Ota said.Reporting by Peter Marsh in London, Kevin Brown in Singapore, Jamil Anderlini in Beijing, Tim Johnston in Bangkok, Patti Waldmeir in Shanghai, Song Jung-a in Seoul, Jane Rickards in Taipei, Hal Weitzman in Chicago, Andrew Ward in Stockholm
14;GLW;Corning Inc;2011-01-18T00:01:18Z;Plastic Logic makes a bold bet on cheap chips;;Most companies forced to abandon a prize product after a decade of development and spending of more than $100m (£63m) might be tempted to call it a day.For Plastic Logic, however, the setback led to the promise of $650m investment from Russia in what amounts to a bold bet on a radically new form of semiconductor technology.The new funding holds out the prospect of allowing the company within five years to make ultra-cheap microchips from plastic that could be incorporated into a wide range of products from domestic appliances to clothing.“The value of just about every manufactured object is capable of being enhanced with the addition of rudimentary intelligence or an IP [internet protocol] address, and plastic microelectronics would help this trend in a big way,” said Pete Bocko, a technology expert at Corning, the US glass and materials company and a leading supplier to the electronics industry.The setback Plastic Logic suffered last summer was its decision to pull out of a launch of what was supposed to be its first product – a lightweight A-4 sized electronic reader called the Que for digital books and other documents based on the company’s plastic microchip technology.The Que had to be killed after Plastic Logic realised it had been outflanked in the fast-changing reader market by products such as the Apple iPad and the Amazon Kindle, which were going on sale far below the Que’s mooted $649 price tag.The company’s immediate future has now been secured with the investment from Rusnano, Russia’s state nanotechnology corporation, which has been promised massive funds from Moscow to promote businesses in fields away from natural resources.Under the funding plan, Rusnano will take a stake of about 25 per cent in Plastic Logic in exchange for an immediate injection of $150m. Further cash going into the company in the next few years – in a mixture of debt and equity – could give Rusnano a majority stake.Existing shareholders include a mix of large companies such as Intel of the US and Germany’s BASF, together with venture groups such as Oak Investment Partners of the US and the UK’s Amadeus Capital Partners, which have together put in some $200m.Richard Archuleta, Plastic Logic’s chief executive, said the “long-term strategy” for the company remained unchanged, in that it still intended to bring out a new “second generation” reader at an unspecified time in the next few years, followed by plastic chips.“We’ve made a lot of progress technically in the past couple of years,” said Mr Archuleta. “We are in a similar stage [in developing plastic microchips] as the silicon industry was in during the 1950s [a decade after the electronic transistor was invented] but with the difference being that we are moving three to five times faster.”David Barnes, principal of BizWitz, a US electronics industry consultancy, said that Plastic Logic’s ideas seemed “full of promise”. However, in the field of new e-reader displays it would face “considerable challenges” in the face of competition from the main makers of displays for existing e-books and related products, which include Samsung and LG of South Korea and AU Optronics, Chi Mei and EI Holdings (formerly PVI) of Taiwan.“These companies have gained a lot of experience in the past few years in the first generation of electronic readers and have now gained a considerable momentum which Plastic Logic will find hard to match,” Mr Barnes said.

Unconventional oil and gas drilling in key North American basins boosted quarterly profits.Larger rivals Halliburton and Schlumberger have also reported better than expected earnings on the back of strength in onshore drilling.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, upgraded the energy sector to “market weight”.“Based on our models, earnings growth, margins, return on equity and cash flow for energy have improved markedly in the past several quarters, while valuations remain quite reasonable,” he said.“Our work indicates that the sector typically begins to perform well once earnings growth becomes positive. September 2010 was the first positive reading since 2008.”Cabot Oil & Gas soared 4.1 per cent to $30.16 and Anadarko Petroleum gained 2.6 per cent to $63.16.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,184.38, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,124.62 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1 per cent lower at 2,504.84.Investors eagerly anticipated Tuesday and Wednesday’s meeting of the Federal Reserve’s open market committee, when many expect the central bank to resolve to deploy a second round of quantitative easing. They also expected a swing to the Republicans in the midterm elections on Tuesday.But analysts at JPMorgan said that although the outcomes of the FOMC meeting and the US midterms should help support stocks in the near term, the longer-term sustainability of the equity rally will rely on growth.“It is encouraging that the third-quarter reporting season has delivered another positive surprise in earnings growth, for the seventh quarter in a row,” they said.“[But in 2011] companies will have to rely more on revenues to generate earnings surprises. And this is becoming already more difficult,” they added.The S&P 500 industrials index rose sharply after data showed US manufacturing rose to a five-month high and the Chinese purchasing managers’ index beat expectations. But it finished the session up just 0.1 per cent.Caterpillar gained 0.9 per cent to $79.27 and Illinois Tool Works climbed 1.2 per cent to $46.23.In healthcare, Humana raised its earnings forecast for the current financial year and beat expectations in its third quarter. The health insurer benefited from lower medical and administrative costs and strength in its plans serving Medicare recipients.But the company would not project a detailed outlook for 2011 before the US government finalises new requirements for spending on medical costs.Humana’s shares, which have risen 16.3 per cent in the past month, were up 0.7 per cent at $58.68. Rivals also gained with Cigna up 0.6 per cent to $35.38 and WellPoint gained 0.7 per cent to $54.72.McKesson, the pharmaceutical distributor, rose 2.9 per cent to $67.88 after it said it planned to buy privately held US Oncology. The deal, valued at about $2.16bn, will help McKesson expand services in the fast-growing area of cancer care.Elsewhere in earnings news, Corning rose 1.2 per cent to $18.50 even though both profit and revenue missed analysts’ estimates.Its display technology division suffered after demand for flat-screen
televisions weakened but the company was upbeat about demand in the fourth quarter.Intel rose 2.6 per cent to $20.48 after the chipmaker’s price target was raised at Macquarie, and the broker upgraded the broader US semiconductor sector.Apple rose 1.1 per cent to $304.18 after it said it had counter-sued Motorola, alleging the mobile phone maker violated patents.

17;GLW;Corning Inc;2009-10-06T12:11:59Z;‘Masters of light’ scoop Nobel physics prize;;Three elderly “masters of light” have won the 2009 Nobel physics prize for discoveries in the 1960s that led to modern fibre optic communications and digital cameras.Charles Kao, a British-American citizen of Chinese ancestry, took half of the SKr10m ($1.4m) award for working out how to transmit pulses of light over long distances through ultra-pure glass fibres. “Today optical fibres make up the circulatory system that nourishes our communication society,” said the Nobel citation.The other half of the prize is shared between Willard Boyle, a Canadian-American, and George Smith of the US for inventing the first practical way to record digital images on a “charge-coupled device”. The CCD has transformed photography and medical imaging.Prof Kao’s work at the Standard Telecommunication Laboratories in Harlow near London was the basis of the fibre optic networks that now span the globe, relaying speech, date and pictures round the world at the speed of light. The internet could not exist in its present form without his research.Prof Kao, 75, was born in Shanghai in 1933 and moved to Hong Kong with his family in 1948. He went on to England to study engineering and work at STL – then the UK research centre of ITT, the US telecoms company – where he made his ground-breaking discovery in 1966.By 1971 scientists at Corning in the US had made a 1km glass fibre pure enough to demonstrate the principle of optical transmission. The first optical cable was laid across the Atlantic Ocean in 1988 and today, according to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the world’s optical fibres laid end-to-end would stretch for 1bn kilometres.After a research career with ITT, Prof Kao returned to Hong Kong in 1987 to serve as vice-chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He retired in 1996.Messrs Boyle, 85, and Smith, 79, spent most of their working lives at Bell Labs in New Jersey, where they invented the CCD in 1969. Their original aim was to create a new type of electronic memory – an application quickly forgotten as the pair realised its potential for recording pictures.By 1975 they had made an experimental digital video recorder with high enough resolution to manage television broadcasts, though the first commercial camera with built-in CCD did not appear till 1981.Now, 40 years after the original discovery, digital cameras dominate the photographic market, and CCDs play a vital role in other fields from medical imaging to astronomy.

The S&P home builders index rose 5.7 per cent.Among the 10 main S&P industry sectors, financials rose 1.5 per cent with information technology lagging by 0.3 per cent.Equity volatility edged up with the S&P Vix (volatility index) trading above 24, after touching a low of 23 last week.Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos believes a normal range for Vix, is between 18 and 22. He said there is still a risk that the S&P 500 could drop back to 825.In the past two weeks, the S&P has risen about 11 per cent beyond 950, the level that had capped stocks since the end of May.Traders believe that the benchmark is on course to reach 1,000, a level not attained since last November. In recent weeks, banks have been raising their year-end targets beyond 1,000 for the S&P.This week’s earnings results will determine whether equities can maintain their recent strong run, say analysts. Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup said that while companies reporting earnings to date, some 40 per cent of the S&P 500, have beaten forecasts by about 11 per cent, the results are still down approximately 25 per cent compared with a year ago.“To be fair, margins have been resilient as corporate management teams have been very effective at delivering the bottom line,” he said.Mr Levkovich said that while some worry about the sustainability of growth, it is not an issue until the second quarter of next year and that latecomers to the market rally could miss out as “stock prices will not stand idly by as they generally trade in sync with earnings”.Analysts at JPMorgan Asset Management said: “With liquidity still supportive, high cash levels still waiting to be deployed and a less volatile environment, as well as improved earnings and a reasonable message from technical signals, the near-term environment appears favourable.”Earlier in earnings news, Honeywell reported a drop of 38 per cent for its second-quarter earnings and after an early fall, its shares rose 0.7 per cent to $34.24.The company’s revenue dropped more than a forecast $7.73bn, falling 22 per cent to $7.56bn versus $9.67bn for the same period a year ago.Shares in Verizon dropped 1.6 per cent to $31 after a 21 per cent drop in profits to $3.16bn.The telecoms group announced 8,000 job cuts, and revenue increased 11 per cent to $26.86bn, boosted by growth in wireless subscribers.Corning, the maker of liquid crystal glass, generated second-quarter earnings of $611m, which beat forecasts, but its shares fell 2.9 per cent to $16.50.Meanwhile, Radioshack, the electronics retailer, also beat estimates as it cut costs, but its shares dropped 6.6 per cent to $15.In deals, Agilent Technologies said it plans to buy Varian for $1.5bn in cash, or $52 a share. Agilent rose 1.8 per cent to $22.66. Varian surged 29.1 per cent to trade at $50.61.Shares in Mylan, the drug maker, fell 12.6 per cent to $12.10 as the company denied a newspaper report that its workers overrode government-mandated quality controls.
19;GLW;Corning Inc;2009-07-27T14:11:16Z;Cost cuts drive income growth at RadioShack;;Electronics retailer RadioShack reported a 17 per cent jump in net income, as cost cuts offset lower sales.Net sales fell 2.9 per cent to $965.7m as sales dipped at company-operated stores and as it closed over 100 of its kiosks. The decline was partially offset by sales at RadioShack de Mexico, which was acquired in December 2008 and a 23.9 per cent increase in online sales.But net income grew as RadioShack cut costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 10.6 per cent to $335.7m, as the company cut back on advertising and payroll, which had been rising in recent quarters as part of an incentive compensation scheme, fell.Earnings per share rose to 39 cents from 32 cents a year earlier, and far exceeding analysts’ expectations of 29 cents per share.But the results weren’t strong enough to maintain the company’s recent gains. The electronic retailer’s stock, which had risen over 18 per cent in the past two weeks, fell 5.60 per cent to $15.16 in early afternoon trade.
20;GLW;Corning Inc;2009-04-27T20:34:27Z;Wall Street fluctuates on swine flu concerns;;US equities fell on Monday as investors worried about the effects of a potential swine flu pandemic.Many companies fluctuated during the session as Wall Street moved to reflect which sectors could lose and which could benefit from an outbreak after the virus reached New York.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, slumped 13.3 per cent to $4.70, while Delta Air Lines fell 14.3 per cent to $6.75. Investors were worried that travel would be the first industry to suffer if the flu continued to spread, and the Bloomberg US Airlines index suffered its heaviest intra-day fall since the session after the September 11 attacks.Tourism companies also suffered. Marriott, the hotel chain, dropped 5.1 per cent to $21.17 and Expedia, the online travel agency, fell 6.3 per cent to $10.53. Carnival, the cruise operator, lost 13.5 per cent to $24.59.Du Pont, which manufactures chemicals for the agricultural industry, led the materials sector lower amid worries about how the outbreak could affect farming. Its shares dropped 4.5 per cent to $27.50.Even credit card companies suffered because of the flu scare, as JPMorgan warned “cross-border fees may suffer from reduced cross-border travel related to the virus”. Visa lost 2.5 per cent to $58.87 and Mastercard retreated 4.4 per cent to $165.55.But Gilead Sciences, the drug company that developed the flu drug Tamiflu, and continues to receive royalties for its sales from Roche, the European company to whom it sold the licence, gained 3.8 per cent to $47.53.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent down at 857.51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.6 per cent lower at 8,025 points and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 1,679.41 points.The market briefly rallied during the morning, but later fell back, despite some analysts saying the selling was overdone. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Investors overreacted during the outbreaks of Sars and bird flu, and we saw that again this morning, as traders shot first and asked questions later.”Lawrence Summers, the chief White House economics adviser, also dented confidence when he told Fox News on Sunday that the US economy would experience “sharp declines in employment for quite some time this year”.Fears that global demand could still be some way from returning hit metals prices, and industrial companies suffered as a result. Freeport McMoRan the copper miner, lost 3.1 per cent to $39.68, while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, gave up 3.8 per cent to $8.79.The macro-economic news overshadowed earnings announcements from several leading companies, including Verizon the second-largest US telecoms company by market value, which beat analysts’ expectations, as it attracted more new customers than expected. But with revenues from business customers continuing to fall, the company’s shares lost 1.5 per cent to $30.54.Elsewhere in the sector, Qualcomm, which makes microchips for mobile phones, disappointed with its first-quarter earnings, but the company gained ground after raising its full-year revenue targets on signs that the market could be improving. Its shares picked up 4.4 per cent to $43.17.Humana, the health insurer, jumped 6.9 per cent to $29.25 after reporting a surge in first-quarter profits, easily exceeding Wall Street’s expectations and allowing it to raise its outlook for full-year profits.Corning, which makes glass for televisions, also beat analysts’ predictions, as the company said demand for its products was improving. Its shares gained 3.3 per cent to $15.84.General Motors was the strongest performer of the morning after it said it would make deep cuts to its plants and workforce and eliminate the Pontiac brand. The company also asked its bondholders to swap $27bn of debt for equity. Its shares surged 20.7 per cent to $2.04.“We didn’t see the sell-off that the pre-market session indicated,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “We’ve lived through 18 months of intense pressure after the financial collapse and we realised this flue outbreak does feel like the next wave.”
21;GLW;Corning Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Corning cuts 3,500 jobs;;"Corning, the US glassmaker, on Tuesday said it would cut 3,500 jobs, or 13 per cent of its workforce, as its fourth- quarter profits plunged on slumping demand for television and computer monitors.Net income declined 65 per cent to $249m, or 16 cents a share, from $717m, or 49 cents, a year earlier, falling below analysts’ expectations. Sales at the company were off by 30 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, falling to $1.1bn.“We experienced a significant momentum shift in many of our core businesses in the fourth quarter as the recession took hold,”
Wendell Weeks, Corning’s chief executive, said.Shares of Corning rose on Tuesday on the news by 0.5 per cent to $10 in mid-day trading.The job cuts will include 1,500 salaried employees and 1,400 temporary workers worldwide. Corning has 51 plants, including several in Taiwan, Korea, Japan and China. The company will take a $165m charge, largely the result of severance
pay-outs.It will also use an early retirement programme and suspend pay increases.James Flaws, Corning’s finance chief, said the company was planning for $5bn in sales in 2009 and that without an improvement in the display-panel market, further job cuts and consolidation could be necessary.“During these tough times, our three priorities are [to preserve] cash, restructuring the company to be profitable at a lower sales level, and accelerating new products while maintaining our focus on long-term growth opportunities,” Mr Flaws said.The New York-based company specialises in glass used for liquid crystal displays, used for flat panel screens, and fibre-optic cables.Sales in its display
division fell 44 per cent in the fourth quarter and 50 per cent on the year.Sales of electronics have been eroded by the economic downturn. According to report on Tuesday by DisplaySearch, sales of liquid crystal display televisions will fall by 16 per cent this year.Corning, which has made speciality glass for more than 150 years, said it expected first-quarter results to remain flat before glass demand picks up in the second quarter.The job cuts came a day after corporate bellwethers in the US and Europe slashed more than 76,000 jobs from their payrolls to confront the deepening economic downturn, marking one of the most brutal days yet for workers on each side of the Atlantic."
22;GLW;Corning Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Electronics bargains spell trouble for tech industry;;Reluctant US shoppers look certain to be tempted by big bargains this holiday season with 32-inch LCD televisions going for $400, small laptop computers for $300 and 8-megapixel digital cameras for $100.Buyers of digital gadgets have learnt they can always expect to get more for less as deflation is built into the business model of the consumer electronics industry, as components become cheaper and more powerful.But the bargains that are expected to hit the stores and electronics websites in the coming weeks, however, are the result of deflationary pressures that are far more severe than usual.They point to a downturn that is already convulsing the global supply chain of the electronics industry, and which is forecast to break out next year into a full-blown recession for some of the largest digital industries, led by PCs and mobile phones.As usual, it is the component makers who are feeling the first wrenching effects of this adjustment. With manufacturers of consumer electronics and computers slashing their inventories and reducing production runs, demand for the semiconductors that comprise the main building block of the digital age has fallen sharply.That was apparent last week when Intel, whose chips are used in more than 80 per cent of all PCs, issued a shocking warning that sales will decline some 12 per cent this quarter, compared with the 3 per cent growth it had forecast only four weeks before.While Intel’s warning has been the most visible sign of the rapid deterioration, a far broader supply chain has been hit.This week, Corning, the US company that is the largest maker of the glass used in flat-panel computer monitors and LCD televisions, said things had got so bad it could no longer offer financial forecasts for this quarter, let alone next year.The slump has wiped 70 per cent from Corning’s share price in the past five months.In the short term, the collapse in the pricing power of component makers is good news for electronics and technology companies. When Dell, the world’s second-biggest PC maker, reports earnings today, its profit margins are expected to get some support from the lower costs.Yet this silver lining will do little to distract from the dark cloud that hangs over the company. With a heavy reliance on US sales, particularly large companies that are usually the first to delay new PC purchases when times get tough, Dell is expected to give an early clue as to how quickly the pain is spreading to the PC business. Dell’s shares are off 70 per cent from their high of a year ago.For buyers of PCs, mobile phones and the wide array of digital consumer electronics, the signs of this industry crunch will be apparent in the stores by next week, with the official launch of the US holiday shopping season on “Black Friday” – the first Friday after Thanksgiving.Rumours abound that heavily discounted products, including a $399 LCD television, which cost hundreds of dollars more a few months ago, will hit the shelves – a move that will highlight the intensity of the downturn.Next year, a full-scale recession is expected to take hold. Analysts and industry forecasters have been rapidly cutting projections, trying to anticipate just how far consumer and corporate demand will fall.The SIA pointed to a forecast that the number of PCs sold around the world next year will be 5 per cent lower than this year, while mobile phone sales will fall 6.5 per cent – the first decline in these markets since 2001.With average selling prices falling fast, the overall outlook is even worse that these numbers suggest. According to a forecast from Citigroup, the PC industry is set to shrink by more than 10 per cent in revenue terms next year.The decline will not be across the board, however, with wholesale shifts to some new products helping some categories of electronics to continue to grow.The PC market, for, instance, is going through a big shift as buyers switch to portable machines.“Desktops are going to suffer, though we still expect notebook [growth] rates to be positive, only at a lower rate,” said Bob O’Donnell, an analyst at IDC.Also, the new category of small, low-priced laptops, known as “netbooks”, is still set to be a hit with consumers this Christmas, in spite of wider problems, he added.Similarly, a move to flat-panel TVs is still fuelling heavy growth in sales of those machines, even if it will be less than previously expected, and will be offset by a collapse in demand for other types of TVs.So far this year, unit sales of flat panel sets have risen 40 per cent, said Tim Herbert, director of market research at the Consumer Electronics Association.
23;GLW;Corning Inc;2008-11-16T19:55:06Z;Glassmaker that expanded with care;;If Wendell Weeks makes a tough decision affecting employees, he does not have to wait long to hear about it. “When I go to the local supermarket, I meet people from the company. I get a performance evaluation every time I’m out.”Mr Weeks, 49, is chairman and chief executive of Corning, a 157-year-old company set in the idyllic rural enclave of the same name in upstate New York. Originally a maker of glass for applications such as cookware and light bulbs, the company has an impressive record for innovation.It has used its expertise in materials engineering to become the world’s biggest maker of the glass used in flat-screen TVs and fibre optical cables for broadband telecommunications networks. The company’s $14bn market capitalisation is still high for a business expected this year to have revenues of about $6bn.But, as the global slowdown threatens to disturb even this tranquil outpost of corporate America, Mr Weeks appears fairly relaxed. He believes that a combination of the close-knit links in the town and his extreme aversion to risk may provide a defence mechanism.Corning’s top management is unusual, being based in a small community where everyone knows each other. Mr Weeks says this creates a set of inbuilt checks that prevent the company’s taking extreme or misguided decisions. His family history reinforces his own attitude to risk – he has painful memories of the collapse of his father’s small business.Speaking during a modest lunch at Corning’s headquarters, the 6ft 5in Mr Weeks says it often surprises people to discover that the head of a company crammed with engineers and technology specialists trained as accountant. Yet he displays a keen interest in scientific concepts, dwelling for 10 minutes or more on some “absolutely fascinating” aspects of laser physics or semiconductor fabrication.His decision to opt for a degree in accounting – he graduated from Lehigh University in 1981 – follows a “horrible” experience growing up in the archetypal working class town of Scranton, Pennsylvania. He saw at first hand what can happen when someone running a company fails to understand finance.“My father set up a small business [designing and installing plumbing systems for households]. The business failed. It was not because of my father’s lack of technical competence. It was because he overextended the business financially. As a result, we went through a very hard time as a family. That’s why I took up accountancy. I thought to myself, ‘If there’s one thing I’m going to do, it’s to understand how money works’.”His conservative accounting principles are one reason, Mr Weeks says, why Corning has hoarded cash – even in the good times of the early years of this decade. It has resisted the temptation to borrow for big acquisitions or plant investments.Corning’s debts of $1.5bn are more than balanced by $3.1bn of cash. The company has a good chance, he says, of maintaining this healthy ratio even if a severe downturn bites. “We are part of the economy like everyone else, so it’s impossible to say we won’t be affected. But over the next three to five years, we have a clear runway [in terms of providing cash to creditors] while we are looking to a range of different end markets to provide a stream of revenue growth.”The town of Corning seems an unlikely place to find a global industrial champion. The company runs a series of big plants in countries including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China. Its US setting speaks of little other than rural tranquillity. The picturesque Chemung River glides past the company’s black-fronted headquarters, which dominate the town, and lies in a valley surrounded by gently undulating wooded hills. The company culture as well as the landscape are strikingly reminiscent of southern Germany and its Mittelstand engineering businesses.Just as some Mittelstand companies have operated for more than 100 years in one small town, Corning, with a population of 9,500, has been the US business’s base for all but the first 17 years of its existence. The town and its surrounding settlements provide jobs for 5,000 employees, a fifth of the company’s global workforce. Descendants of Amory Houghton – the founder – live close by.Before he joined the company, Mr Weeks worked for Price Waterhouse (now PwC) and audited Corning’s accounts (PwC remains the company’s auditor). He took a job in its finance department in 1983 and, apart from a two-year stint at Harvard for an MBA in 1985, has lived in the town ever since. He took over as chief executive in 2005 and chairman last year.Having close links to the town has stopped the company taking on excessive debt or making decisions based on anything other than long and rigorous thought, Mr Weeks says. “We [the upper management of Corning] are not separated from the consequences of what we do.”It has not always made the right calls. Corning experienced a big shock in 2002 when the boom in setting up telecoms networks came to an abrupt end, dousing demand for fibre optic products. In two years, the company’s share price went from more than $100 to $1. Yet the episode served to reinforce Mr Weeks’ natural caution.“We discovered there were some aspects [to Corning’s corporate personality] where we are not as beautiful as we would have liked,” Mr Weeks says. “We’ve tried to modify the company to the extent that we think our potential exposure [to a downturn] has been reduced.”As well as being careful with cash, this means mitigating the risk of heavy spending on research and development by spreading sales between industrial markets and regions of the world. “We spend 10 per cent of our revenues on R&D. These are high fixed costs. When volumes [from products that emanate from the R&D] go down, we don’t look so bright,” Mr Weeks says.In the past few years, Mr Weeks has directed Corning to sell its new ideas – in fields such as carbon-based materials or new light sources – to a wider range of sectors than it has tapped in the past. So its customers now go beyond home electronics and telecoms companies: it sells diesel filters for vehicle exhausts in the car industry, and scientific instruments to the pharmaceutical industry, among others.As Mr Weeks looks ahead, he stresses that the company “cannot be immune” from a global downturn. But he feels it has done enough to make the outlook reasonably secure. “Our mission is another 150 years of innovation and independence. I hope what we’re doing today will benefit my successors [as CEO] in maybe 10 years’ time.”

As the session drew to a close, the market fell by a jaw-dropping 5 per cent within 10 minutes.The S&P 500 finished 1.1 per cent lower at 930.09 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.8 per cent at 8,990.96. The Nasdaq Composite index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,657.21.Contributing to the confusion, Dow Jones reported that General Electric, which has not provided guidance for 2009, aimed to keep profits next year at the same level as this year even if revenue declined by between 10 and 15 per cent. The shares closed down 1.5 per cent to $19.20. After the close, GE said the report was “out of context” and “inaccurate”.Observers were divided as to the impact of the Fed’s 50 basis point cut, which was already priced in to the equity market.“What’s really driving the market are the other programmes that are breaking the log jams,” said Doug Roberts, strategist at Channel Capital Research, with reference to government measures to shore up the banking sector.Other recent monetary policy interventions had done little to help sentiment, but Joe Cusick, market analyst at optionsXpress, said: “This one’s a little bit different.”Fears of widespread financial collapse that trumped all other concerns had dissipated, he added, and a move to lower the cost of borrowing was likely now to have a tangible effect.Procter & Gamble lost 3.5 per cent to $60.99 after the consumer products group met analyst earnings estimates but still lowered the bottom end of its full-year earnings guidance. Citigroup maintained its “hold” rating on the stock.Kraft and Kellogg fell 1.4 per cent to $28.47 and 1.3 per cent to $50.02, respectively, even after price increases helped the food groups beat forecasts.Telecoms was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500, down 3.3 per cent overall. Investors were concerned by a sharp drop in basic video subscribers at Comcast, which dropped 9.9 per cent to $15.28, although the group reported better-than-expected earnings and reiterated its full-year outlook. Smaller rival Qwest slid 7.7 per cent to $2.40 after lowering its guidance for the year.Motorola fell 6.5 per cent to $5.46 ahead of results due on Friday. Reports said that the phone group would streamline its cellphone division and cut thousands of jobs.Energy was the biggest sectoral winner, up 3.6 per cent as oil prices edged higher. Solar energy stocks rallied after First Solar, which gained 1.5 per cent to $115.75, entered the residential market with a deal to supply modules to SolarCity, an installation company.Education stocks rose, helped by better-than-expected figures from Apollo Group, the parent company of the University of Phoenix, which rallied 10.4 per cent to $65.01.Aetna tumbled 8.1 per cent to $25.55 after the health insurer trimmed its forecast for the year. Fears over the prospect of writedowns and a possible capital-raising have driven the sector down sharply in recent months.Corning fell 8 per cent to $10.51 after the glass and ceramics maker missed analysts’ estimates on lower demand for televisions.General Motors rose 8.2 per cent to $6.76 after Reuters reported that the car group had resolved “major issues” with Chrysler owner Cerberus Capital Management over a potential merger.Visa edged up 1.4 per cent to $50.69. After the bell, the credit card group cut its annual revenue growth target, citing a challenging economy and the shares lost 1.2 per cent in after-hours trade.Among a host of insurers to post results after the bell, Prudential Financialdisclosed it swung to a quarterly loss. The shares were down 3.3 per cent at $35.25 and remained flat in after-hours trade.In addition to the rate cut, traders took comfort from further signs of easing in money markets and data showing that durable goods orders rose unexpectedly last month.
25;GLW;Corning Inc;2008-09-14T16:37:11Z;Shanghai: Honorary Citizen gives top tips;;Few foreign executives know Shanghai better than Simon MacKinnon, president of the China operations of Corning, the US glass and technology Fortune 500 company. He first lived in the city since 1985, long before it started to reinvent itself as a 21st century metropolis. After leading P&O in China he has been at Corning since 2000. In recognition of his long experience, he was made an Honorary Citizen of Shanghai last year.HotelsFor business travellers, he suggests the JW Marriott (399 Nanjing Xi Lu), the Four Seasons (500 Weihai Lu) and the Radisson Plaza Xing Guo (78 Xing Guo Lu), which Mr MacKinnon explains is “located in a park with a variety of pre-1949 villas, including the house where Chairman Mao often used to stay on his visits to Shanghai”. All these options are in Puxi, on the west side of the river. In Pudong, on the east side, he recommends the Shangri-La (33 Fu Cheng Lu), “with views across the river to the Bund” (the main waterfront avenue along the Huangpu river), and the Grand Hyatt (Jin Mao Dasha, 88 Shiji Dadao), located in the 80-storey Jin Mao building, which is one of the tallest in the world. For more “adventurous” choices, he recommends a couple of boutique hotels: the Mansion Hotel (82 Xinle Lu), “refurbished in Art Deco and pre-liberation style, formerly the home of one of Shanghai’s most infamous gangsters, Du Yue Sheng”, and the JIA Hotel (931 Nanjing Xi Lu, entrance on Taixing Lu).Eating and drinkingWhen he first came to Shanghai, dining out was a struggle. “In the 1980s we had to go to bed at eight o’clock at night, but now you can go out for food 24 hours a day and there are a vast number of choices.”For international cuisine, he suggests M on the Bund, which is Michelle Garnaut’s restaurant with a terrace overlooking the water, especially in spring and autumn. (The entrance is on a side-road to the Bund called Guangdong Lu.) For drinks, head down one floor to The Glamour Bar where large windows also look over the Huangpu River.One of the best aspects of Chinese cuisine, he says, is its variety. Shanghaienese food deserves to be tried for its distinctive sweet tastes and delicate shellfish specialities. Mr MacKinnon recommends the restaurant franchise Xiao Nan Guo and the long-established 1221 (1221 Yanan Xi Lu). Another lively option is Bao Luo (271 Fumin Lu by Changle Lu), which stays open late.For the spicier flavours of Sichuan cuisine, he mentions South Beauty (881 Yanan Zhong Lu, by Tongren Lu) or, for the more adventurous, Ba Guo Bu Yi (1676 Hongqiao Lu), which is arranged like a traditional Chinese house around a courtyard.“For Japanese food lovers, I can recommend Shintori [803 Julu Lu by Fumin Lu],” and for Asian-western fusion food, Mr MacKinnon goes next-door to People 6, which is also a good choice for drinks.On an afternoon off“Shanghai is a mixture of east and west and it has managed to preserve a lot of the wonderful European-style buildings from the beginning of the century,” Mr MacKinnon says. He recommends the tours guided by Peter Hibberd, one of the city’s leading historians, who can be contacted through his website gingergriffin.com. “My favourite buildings are along the Bund and in the French Concession area, with the plane trees lining many streets,” he says.The buildings, designed by Laszlo Hudec, the Hungarian architect, in the first half of the 1900s, are among the finest in the older parts of Shanghai, he says, such as the Park Hotel, the former McTyeire School and the old American Club.Other highlights are the Peace Hotel along the Bund – Waitan in Chinese – and the imposing Bank of China building next door.If you want to do a bit of shopping, you could get a suit or a qipao (a traditional Chinese dress) made by the many tailor shops.“There are several buildings full of stalls and tailors who will fit and make suits and dresses at the Nan Matou Lu fabric market, near the river, in Puxi.It helps to have someone who speaks Chinese with you, but many visitors manage just fine with plenty of bargaining and smiles.”For those staying in Shanghai for a longer stretch, Mr MacKinnon suggests the nearby cities of Suzhou and Hangzhou for their popular traditional gardens and pavilions. The former is also set among traditional tea plantations.
26;GLW;Corning Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Tech sector;;The technology sector, it was once hoped, might be a safe haven. But it has proved merely another refuge to be blown away by the winds of the credit crunch. Research released by Forrester on Tuesday found that 43 per cent of large global companies have cut IT budgets this year, adding to mounting gloom. During the past two weeks Dell, Qualcomm, Corning, Ciena and Nokia have warned, in various ways, of softer demand – and most have suffered double-digit share price falls, dragging down both European and US peers. The Nasdaq Composite’s recent 5 per cent slide outstripped the S&P’s 3 per cent fall.The challenges facing tech companies are now spreading outside the US and all along the technology chain. Demand in Europe and Asian emerging markets that had partly offset US weakness is slowing. The stronger dollar makes things worse for US groups, though provides a modicum of relief for European counterparts. Corporate and domestic customers are both being squeezed. Forrester’s survey found nearly half of financial services companies, their balance sheets creaking, have trimmed IT spending. Ciena warned that phone companies, feeling no urgency to upgrade technology, are delaying new contracts. And cash-strapped consumers are, says Qualcomm’s chief, keeping old mobile phones longer. That is forcing some handset makers to cut prices, although Nokia says it will not follow suit. Even segments enjoying growth, such as LCD TVs, are not immune. Corning cut projections of sales of glass for LCD panels after TV assemblers built up excess stocks.This slowdown lacks the force of the technology collapse in 2001, when a huge build-up of overcapacity was followed by large-scale order cancellations. Companies with competitive products either recently released or about to pop out of the pipeline will be in a position to take market share from rivals. But a broader recovery across the technology sector will not come until demand shows clear signs of reviving. Historical trends suggest that may not be before the second half of 2009 at the earliest.To email the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here

Microsoft edged down 0.74 per cent to $26.90In the broader market, the S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,274.98 in a volatile session, weighed down by a gloomy economic update from the Federal Reserve.The Nasdaq lost 0.7 per cent at 2,333.73, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 11,532.88Chris Watling, chief executive of Longview Economics, said markets seemed “likely to continue falling” in the short term.Oil prices dropped for the fourth day in a row on Wednesday, losing 36 cents to $109.35 a barrel, which again took their toll on commodity stocks.Materials came under pressure after analysts at Lehman Brothers said that “a rebound in US and European steel equities appears unlikely despite the attractive valuations…[because] buyer behaviour poses a serious threat to steel prices.”AK Steel fell 5 per cent to $45.53 and Nucor lost 0.5 per cent at $48.84.Among the oil-related stocks to suffer declines, BJ Services and Halliburton fell 5.2 per cent to $24.07 and 3.3 per cent to $41.33, respectively.Still, the oil price had a mixed effect on the consumer discretionary and consumer goods sectors on Wednesday. They gained 0.6 per cent and lost 0.1 per cent, respectively, in spite of positive retail sales data.Media companies were the leading fallers in the consumer discretionary sector after some analyst downgrades and reports that
Hollywood studios are scaling back the number of films they release.Bernstein Research downgraded Time Warner from “outperform” to “market perform”, arguing that the planned separation from Time Warner Cable and the potential sale of AOL were among several catalysts already priced into the stock. more if neededTime Warner fell 2.2 per cent to $16.33 while Viacom dropped 3.6 per cent to $29.12. Meanwhile, retail data provided a small fillip. Same-store retail sales rose slightly across the board, according to the International Council of Shopping Centres. Nordstrom climbed 5.47 per cent at $33.33 and Dillard’s gained 3.07 per cent at $13.45.Coca-Cola fell 0.6 per cent to $51.66 after the soft-drinks maker agreed to purchase China Huiyuan Juice Group for about $2.3bn.Staples rose 1.66 per cent to $25.18 after its second-quarter profits – although 16 per cent lower– were no worse than expected.Financials pared early losses, buoyed by some good news from the bond insurer regulators, which approved a plan by Ambac Financial Group to move funds into a new municipal bond insurer called Connie Lee. Ambac jumped 22.4 per cent to $8.65.However, First Horizon fell 0.4 per cent to $11.74 after the Tennessee bank said write-offs for bad loans could be higher this year than forecast. Goldman Sachs lost 1.4 per cent to $167.61 after Credit Suisse cut its third-quarter profit forecast for the second time in a month.Lehman Brothers lost 5 per cent to $16.97 on news of the demise of a flagship fund run by Ospraie Management, part owned by the embattled investment bank."
28;GLW;Corning Inc;2008-06-08T15:21:31Z;Eureka moments that can last for decades;;For a company credited with many serious scientific achievements, Corning expends a lot of hot air. The air – containing exhaust gases from car engines – is being produced to test the performance of new filters that are beneficial to the environment.Corning hopes that these environmental products – filters to clean up the exhaust streams of diesel cars, trucks and industrial plants – will help its growth in the next decade. Their development was not rapid: creating the right materials, based on aluminium titanate, took 10 years.Such long-term projects are not unusual for the company. Corning has carved a reputation for funding projects that can take as long as 15 years to yield results, where others in the field are typically prepared to finance ideas for only three to four years. Corning spends $600m a year on research and development, most of which is focused on products using silicon-based chemistry, primarily linked to glass and ceramics.Last year it increased net profits after special items by 27 per cent to $2.15bn, on sales of $5.86bn. This was mainly down to its success in making the ultra-thin and highly pure glass used in liquid crystal-based flat-screen televisions. The product has been a big growth area over the past five years and Corning is by a long way the world’s biggest producer.The company’s original use for the glass, though, was as a tough new material for windscreens. After a 15-year research effort, it identified its new application in screens.Environmental products such as the exhaust filters will provide the next phase in its development, the company hopes. Yet its decision to use aluminium titanate rather than silicon carbide, the substance adopted by its rivals in environmental technology, has attracted controversy.“We decided in 2001 that silicon carbide did not have good enough technical prospects to be the material of choice for the future generations of diesel filters. We decided to try for something better,” says Thomas Hinman, head of Corning’s environmental division.“Silicon carbide has a high resistance to temperature – which makes it a promising material for dealing with hot gases – but it expands too much when subject to heat. This reduces its structural stability, which in our opinion means it is less useful in this particular application.”All diesel filters plug into the exhausts of diesel engines, mainly to remove from exhaust streams the tiny particulates of soot and other harmful materials produced as part of the diesel combustion process.As a result of progressively tighter environmental regulations, global sales of these filters have been growing quickly. They could reach about $2bn a year by 2012 – covering devices used both in trucks and cars – according to Corning’s projections.While it backed away from silicon carbide, rivals in vehicle filters – chiefly NGK and Ibiden, two Japanese auto parts makers – have persisted with it. After its 10-year effort, Corning is now making filters based on aluminium titanate in large volumes.Corning’s scientists have also spent a great deal of time developing a new kind of optical fibre. This has involved winding fibres tightly around thin tubes and observing not whether it will snap but whether they can pass light through the material without losing more than a small fraction through its outer walls.Since optical fibre can carry a much greater amount of information than copper cable, it has for years been preferred as the medium of choice in long-distance telecoms routes. However, installing it in small quantities in premises has always been difficult because even small amounts of distortion can cause light to leak out, making the product useless.Corning’s scientists ended up making a fibre called Clearcurve, which can be wound 100 times around a pencil without any loss of light. This achievement offers a significant commercial prize: the first easy-to- install form of fibre for carrying telecoms signals. Clearcurve can be carried around and handled as simply as copper cable.In a world of accelerating product life cycles, Corning’s faith in its ability to overcome technical hurdles shows that a different approach to innovation is possible – even if the results take a decade to come to fruition.
29;GLW;Corning Inc;2008-05-31T04:12:28Z;Home thoughts reassure when investing abroad;;"If you expect the dollar to continue going down, should you buy foreign stocks? Not necessarily. One consequence of a devaluation is a unilateral wage reduction. In an export industry, that’s pure gravy.Suppose that you were, as I once was, a wine grower in France and (as it did under President Mitterrand) the franc lost half its value against the dollar. Bliss! Your expenses stay about the same, while the dollar component of your sales soars, as do your profits.In reverse, though, if the dollar drops, a French wine grower selling mostly to America is in terrible shape. His expenses remain the same, but his sales and profits collapse. If you expect a lower dollar, you should avoid foreign companies dependent on our market.Usually matters are not black and white. Boeing gains a lot against Airbus from a weak dollar, but still must pay more for the materials and components it buys from abroad.Should we then, expecting a lower dollar, buy foreign stocks – let’s say European companies selling very little here?I’d say, sure. Assuming a lower dollar, the whole eurozone will become relatively more valuable in dollar terms, so other things being equal you will come out ahead. On the other hand, things often aren’t equal. Foreign companies are more likely to have two sets of books, to take more advantage of their shareholders, and to be less transparent. The requirements of our regulatory bodies are onerous to fulfil, but do give shareholders a good view of what’s going on, and a powerful redress if they are abused.In general I think leading American companies are likely to be better managed than foreign ones. They’re more innovative, and our home market is bigger. Furthermore, the immense salaries given to our chief executives allow our companies to hire top top talent from anywhere. Often, they’re worth it.Where things get tough is when the US company has much higher labour costs, including healthcare, than its foreign competitors, as in the car and apparel sectors. In general, companies with high labour costs should be avoided, and particularly if they compete head on with say, the Chinese. Instead, buy our service companies.“Foreign” is a big place, of course. You’ve got good countries and not so good but growing countries, and countries that are growing explosively. I would say that aside from a possible currency play, there’s no particular reason for an American to invest in a highly developed nation – Germany for example, or Japan. And they have troubling pension problems ahead as their populations age.Moving to the second tier, Russia is a puzzle. I wouldn’t be happy there personally, but it’s an interesting world: corrupt, but becoming stronger. China and India are booming, but again have corruption problems. In cases such as these, local subsidiaries of international companies can be more comfortable places to be.Then come the high-growth third-world countries. (Here I must declare an interest: I’ve been involved in that sector, lately as a director and shareholder of emerging market funds run out of London.) I feel at home there, particularly in the smaller-company category. Good, smaller third-world companies do better and sell more cheaply than larger companies, but are vastly harder to analyse. And consider that the more alarming the country, the cheaper the companies. So an admirable play is a top company in a disconcerting country that turns out all right, such as Egypt or Nigeria. As a retail investor, you should buy through a fund.So if you want to venture abroad it is usually more sensible for the individual investor to buy US companies with extensive foreign sales rather than foreign companies, unless they are hard-to-analyse “emerging” ones, in which case a fund is best. But which US companies? You can find the foreign sales component in their regular reports and, for example, in the Value Line reports. Here are some good growth companies, in order of their foreign sales: Intel (81 per cent); Ebay (80); Qualcomm (78); Schlumberger (68); Corning (59); Procter & Gamble (57); Goldman Sachs (46); Johnson & Johnson (44); Apple (41).Finally, though, should one necessarily assume that the dollar will continue to decline? It’s already cheap in terms of purchasing-power parity: you pay much more for the same article in euros than here. And the dollar isn’t going to zero. The other big countries have problems, too.The writer is chairman of Montrose Group, investment counsel in New York.

30;GLW;Corning Inc;2008-04-29T21:04:48Z;Wall St lower ahead of Fed decision;;Wall Street stocks hung in the doldrums on Tuesday as investors digested data showing that two pillars of the US economy – house prices and consumer confidence – continue to crumble, and a sell-off in commodities hit related stocks.The day began in downbeat fashion as markets reacted poorly to the S&P/Case Shiller 20-city house price index, which plunged for a 10th consecutive month and at an accelerating rate. The three-month annualised rate of decline in US house prices is now nearly 25 per cent.That prospect continues to damp consumer confidence. The latest survey showed consumer confidence hit the lowest level since just before the US-led invasion of Iraq.Julian Jessop at Capital Economics, said: “The financial markets may have decided that the glass is half full but consumers remain stubbornly miserable . . . All things considered, the downbeat views of consumers appear much closer to reality.”The biggest drag, however, was the materials sector which dipped 3.1 per cent, its biggest fall in over a month, following commodities prices lower.A mini-rally in technology, which climbed for the first time in three sessions, and some steady performances from consumer discretionary stocks helped markets retain a measure of composure.After a light session of trading, the benchmark S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,390.96, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 12,831.94. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,426.10.Investors remain listless ahead of a likely 25 basis point rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and a host of potentially market-moving economic data to be released later in the week.With volumes on the low side, equity markets have treaded water for much of the week so far, piqued only by news that Mars, the confectioner, could purchase chewing-gum heavyweight Wrigley for $23bn, aided by Warren Buffett.Healthcare stocks lagged as poor earnings, analyst downgrades and news of drug approval setbacks hit the sector. Merck led the fallers, dropping 10.4 per cent to $37.14 after its cholesterol pill failed to win approval. It was followed by Medco Health, down 4.3 per cent to $49.12, and Tenet Healthcare, down 2.2 per cent to $6.55.Financials were in focus after Countrywide, the mortgage lender that Bank of America has agreed to buy, reported its third quarterly loss in a row. Analysts said the results may lead Bank of America to reduce or even cancel its offer to buy the company for $4bn in stock.Countrywide shares rose 0.3 per cent to $5.85, while Bank of America lost 0.8 per cent to $37.86 and the wider sector was mixed. The S&P 500 index of financial shares ended the day down 0.6 per cent.According to KBW, of the 119 banks it covers, just over half have missed consensus earnings estimates, because of rapidly deteriorating assets. More worryingly, the growth of non-performing assets has outpaced that of reserves suggesting more problems lie ahead.Despite the negative data, homebuilder stocks, which have been unpredictable in the face of the ever-deepening housing slump, were mixed on Tuesday. DR Horton dropped 2.7 per cent to $16.69 and Pulte Homes slid 2.8 per cent to $13.80 but Lennar and Centex added 3.8 per cent to $20.28 and 4 per cent to $22.27 respectively.In materials, the mood was broadly pessimistic. Titanium Metals lost 6.1 per cent to $15.95, Monsanto fell 9.1 per cent to $110.93 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 4.4 per cent to $110.72.But there were bright spots. Office Depot said first-quarter profits fell less than expected and its shares advanced 8.7 per cent to $13.Credit card companies outperformed. Visa said profit jumped 28 per cent thanks in part to strong international growth. Visa shares, which have risen more than 70 per cent since its $17.9bn initial public offering last month, added 6.9 per cent to $80.85.Meanwhile, MasterCard, Visa’s main rival, popped 12.7 per cent to $273.34 after it said first-quarter profit soared 85 per cent to $398m thanks to strong revenues, beating estimates.Technology was among the strongest sectors in the S&P 500 on the day. Corning added 3.3 per cent to $26.53 after it said first-quarter profit more than tripled, and Yahoo and Motorola climbed 3.6 per cent to $27.37 and 5.7 per cent to $10 respectively.
31;GLW;Corning Inc;2008-02-02T00:14:55Z;‘It’s my spiritual sanctuary’;;David Maude-Roxby-Montalto di Fragnito is one of the world’s most renowned glass engravers. His work is in collections that include the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum in New York as well as private collections worldwide. With his wife, Patsy, he divides his time between homes in Chateaux D’Oex, Switzerland, London and the Palazzo Ducale in Fragnito Monforte, a hilltop village in Southern Italy.Tell me about your home in Fragnito.The ancient castele of Fragnito is documented in the national archives of Benevento, the nearby city. It refers to Fragnito as dating back to the 11th century. The name comes from the word fragna, which is a species of tree dominating the main square in the village, under which locals through the ages have always sat to escape the hot summer sun playing dice games on the stones. The palazzo ducale came into the possession of the Montalto family as a reward for winning a battle in the 15th century. In the second world war the castle defended the only road dividing the north and south of Italy and Rommel apparently stopped there on his way to the south.How did you come to inherit the ducal title and estate?The Montalto family is the original Italian branch of my family, the Maudes. Each branch of the family passed this information down from father to son and therefore when I was a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence in 1957 with their son and heir, Don Ruggiero, Prince of Lequile, I was considered one of the family and stayed with them on numerous occasions. Don Ruggiero, who was an only child, died in a tragic accident in 1966 and his parents, Don Francesco and Donna Anna Maria, Duke and Duchess of Fragnito, asked my parents if they could adopt me. They gave me the ducal palace and other land and properties and I took up full time residence in Italy.What were your feelings about your new home and responsibilities?From the moment I inherited Fragnito I felt inspired to create something more than just a home. I had many plans and ideas for its future and started working on them straight away so that I could share parts of it with the community. Everyone in the village was aware of who I was and how the situation had arisen and after my adopted father’s death in 1977 they called me Il Duca.Were you married at the time?I married Patsy after my adoption but before the death of Don Francesco, by which time we already had our two children, Alexandra and Daniel. They always spent their school holidays at Fragnito and brought friends to stay. Their great excitement was finding secret passages, lost keys and armour. If they were naughty, instead of a normal punishment they were made to clean some of the old neglected objects in the attics and cellars. They love the place and the Italian way of life, particularly the cuisine. My wife has always supported me in all aspects of life in Fragnito. She is not only a great wife and mother but a great organiser.What was your vision for Fragnito.Well, before I answer that question, I want to mention my vision generally for the crafts. As a glass engraver I was elected as one of six top craftsmen in Florence to be a founder member of the Consorziortigianali, responsible for creating a consortium of craftsmen for the city. This made me aware that there was no government responsibility in the UK for crafts and in 1967 I wrote to every member of parliament lobbying them to appoint a minister. Eight years later Viscount Eccles took on the role. This led to other interesting developments for me, which included being a director of the Crafts Council of Great Britain and, through an introduction from my friend the violinist Yehudi Menuhin, a trustee of West Dean, the home of the eccentric collector Edward James. These experiences gave me the idea of bringing cultural events to Fragnito. The village was divided by petty political squabbles and I wanted a way of bringing these to an end. In 1972 I introduced a hot air balloon festival in the grounds of the estate, which had an astonishing impact. From a tiny event it is now the largest in Italy and brings international visitors and of course revenue to the village. It became a vehicle for developing my dreams for other cultural events in the province. Next year we are starting a programme of opera masterclasses at our home under the directorship of the baritone Roderick Williams.Tell me about some of the major renovations you have made to the house.The latest renovation was cleaning and improving the coach area which had been used for burning enormous fires to heat the house. This huge job of work was achieved miraculously in only six weeks thanks to our brilliant local craftsmen. At times they looked like moving sculptures, smothered in dust from the old plaster and stones. Another major renovation is a derelict Masseria (farmhouse) in a magnificent setting for which the Italian government has awarded us a generous grant. And the next plan on our agenda is to cover the court yard so we can stage theatrical and operatic events confidently come rain or shine.Tell me about your beautiful gardens. Who was responsible for the concept and design?The terraced gardens and courtyard were re-planned by our good friend, landscape gardener Spindrift Al Swaidi, who has won prizes at the Chelsea Flower Show. Patsy was adamant that the gardens should be formal and complement the architectural lines of the buildings. It is linear and the colour scheme has been kept to cream and a palette of pale greys and greens.You are renowned as one of the world’s leading glass engravers with studios in your home in Chateau D’Oex, Switzerland, and also in Fragnito.My work is a unique form of engraving called diamond-point stippling, which I took up in 1961 having seen the magnificent work at the Rijks Museum in Amsterdam and the V&A. It felt like a gate across my path of life swinging open. When Britain entered the EEC I was commissioned to engrave glasses for each head of state and also goblets that were presented to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. I have worked on a variety of unusual commissions, including a unique “peace pen” for Monegrappa, Italy’s oldest company. It involved designing a box with the help of Baccarat with a handle, moulded by me, of a dove sitting on an open hand. Another glorious commission came when jewellers Harry Winston asked me to make a necklace using a 50 carat ruby. I moulded the figures of Adam and Eve around the ruby and used ruby cabuchons for the forbidden fruit and marquise diamonds for the leaves. It was bought by a client in Japan. But I think my most thrilling work recently completed was inspired by seeing Andy Warhol’s four portraits of Beethoven. I felt compelled to create my own interpretation of this moody man, who only sat for one portrait for a major sponsor when he was composing the Missa Solemnis. The portrait of Warhol appears in a somewhat ghost like form on top of the image of Beethoven. I have had a long and productive collaboration with Baccarat and currently a film is being made about me and my philosophy expressed through poetry.You are so passionate about your extraordinary home. What, above all, most inspires you?The craftsmanship in every stone of the palazzo ducale, the proportions and the atmosphere. It’s my spiritual sanctuary.
32;GLW;Corning Inc;2008-01-28T21:49:02Z;Wall St rallies on rate cut hopes;;Wall Street stocks rallied on Monday, after overcoming an initial wobble, as hopes for more aggressive interest rate cuts spurred gains in financial companies ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Tuesday.US equities, although volatile, fared much better than traders had feared, after a sharp sell-off in Asia and Europe looked set to deliver another down day in the US.The outlook for investors was far from serene after new home sales plunged to a 12-year low and McDonald’s shares hit the skids after disappointing December same-store sales.The S&P 500 closed up 1.8 per cent at 1,353.97 points having fallen 0.6 per cent at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 1.5 per cent to 12,383.89 while the Nasdaq Composite rallied strongly to close up 1 per cent at 2,349.91 after it briefly turned negative in afternoon trade.Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said equities were showing tentative signs of stabilising. “Three out of the last four days we have finished up near the highs of the day, that’s a real turn from the way the market has behaved.”A factor that may decide if stocks can find a footing this week will be the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate policy. Since the Fed made an emergency 75 basis point rate cut last week investors have been divided over whether the central bank will cut rates 25bp or 50bp when its meeting concludes on Wednesday.The futures market has priced in an 86 per cent chance the Fed will take the more dovish approach – to lower the Fed funds rate to 3 per cent.“Anything less than 25bp would probably risk a significant negative reaction in the financial markets,” said Maury Harris, an economist at UBS Investment Research.In spite of the rally investors were still awaiting a clear signal about whether equities have become oversold or if recent upticks were merely the product of a fleeting bear-market rally.Given fears the economy is entering a recession, this week’s data on the state of the labour and housing markets are important.New home sales fell 4.7 per cent to a 604,000 annual rate in December, the lowest reading in 12 years, compared with expectations of about 650,000.The homebuilder sector pared early losses to extend last week’s 28 per cent rally as traders bet that rate cuts would help the sector. The S&P homebuilder index climbed 6.4 per cent to 426.29, with Lennar up 9 per cent at $18.50.“The stock market apparently believes the worst is over,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. “[But] we think the downside for activity and prices remains considerable. To repeat, there is no sign of a bottom in any of these data.”Confidence in the health of the US consumer took another dent on Monday after McDonald’s reported flat December same-store sales owing to a softening in consumer spending. The stock fell 5.6 per cent to $51.07 while rival Wendy’s gave up 5.3 per cent to $23.92. Also in the consumer sector, Sears Holdings rose 1.3 per cent to $100.28 after its chief executive left. Financial companies en­joyed the best of the gains, with Lehman Brothers rising 4.8 per cent to $60.63 and JPMorgan up 4.4 per cent at $45.57.After the close American Express said fourth quarter profit fell 10 per cent, in line with estimates, after it took a charge to cover bad loans. The shares closed up 4.3 per cent at $47.40 but fell 2.8 per cent after hours.The telecoms sector came under early pressure before rebounding after Verizon Communications reported weakness in its fixed line business. Quarterly earnings rose 3.9 per cent, in line with expectations and the shares closed up 0.9 per cent at $38.11. Corning, gained 3.3 per cent to $23.10 after it raised fourth-quarter profit 11 per cent amid heavy demand for glass used in flat-screen TVs and computers. Gains in the transport sector were limited after YRC Worldwide, the trucking company, fell to a $735.8m loss – far worse than expected. The shares fell 14.7 per cent to $16.08.Alliance Data Systems’ $6.76bn buy-out by Blackstone was put into doubt. Shares in the credit card services provider plunged 35.2 per cent to $42.48 while Blackstone slipped 1.1 per cent to $19.15.
33;GLW;Corning Inc;2007-07-25T20:39:15Z;Wall St higher in volatile session;;"Wall Street stocks closed higher on Wednesday as investors responded to generally upbeat company earnings from companies including Amazon and Boeing and got to grips with fresh housing market data.The market had opened higher after the sell-off of the previous session, turning sharply negative for a short period early in the day before closing off its best levels for the day after news that Chrysler had postponed a $12bn loan deal.Early gains were driven by Amazon, which more than tripled its second quarter profit and raised its 2007 sales and operating earnings outlook. Its shares were up 24 per cent or $15.34 at $84.59 at midday in New York.Amazon’s share price gains were fuelled as JP Morgan lifted its rating from ”underweight” to ”neutral”, saying it sees strong revenue growth in 2007 and 2008. It added that Amazon’s valuation ”provides limited upside.”At the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent at 1,518.09, the Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.3 per cent higher at 2,648.17. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent at 13,785.07.The materials sector, fell about 1.1 per cent. All other sectors, bar semiconductors, were positive for the day.Volatility remained very high. Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “It used to be the case that as stocks went up, volatility went down. “That relationship is coming apart at the seams these days with investors keen to buy the CBOE Vix index futures and options with the specific aim of protecting portfolios from a downturn in the broad market.”He added that the Vix index rose on Wednesday even as the Dow and S&P 500 roseEarnings remained a sharp focus for investors.Before the opening bell, Boeing raised its full-year earnings forecast and reported net income of $1.35 a share in the second quarter compared with a loss
of $160m, or 21 cents, a year earlier, when the company paid a $615m government fine.Its shares rose 3.3 per cent to $107.23. Boeing also said it was on track to deliver the first 787 Dreamliner in May, although research and development costs for the fuel-saving jet – which has generated more orders than any new aircraft in history – have risen.ConocoPhillips and Colgate Palmolive also reported better than expected second quarter results, buoying sentiment.ConocoPhillips shares were up 2.4 per cent at $84.21. Colgate Palmolive shares rose 2.1 per cent to $69.66 after the company reported second-quarter profit was $415.8m, or 76 cents per share, compared with $283.6m, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.Apple was set to report after the market close. Its shares lost 6 per cent on Tuesday on concerns about weaker than expected sales of the iPhone from AT&T, but regained 1.8 per cent to close at $137.26.In economic news, the pace of existing home sales fell to its lowest for more than four years in June, according to the latest reading on the state of the battered property market.Home resales fell to a 5.75m annual rate, a 3.8 per cent decrease from May’s revised 5.98m annual pace, the National Association of Realtors said.May’s rate had been estimated at 5.99m.Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress last week that he expected housing demand to stabilise and housing to be a less severe drag on growth in the coming months.US economic activity expanded further in June and early July, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, as slower housing markets were offset by gains in manufacturing and commercial real estate.In deal news, medical diagnostics provider Dade Behring Holdings rose 32.8 per cent to $74.26 after Siemens agreed to buy it for $77 a share.A 70 per cent profit rise for NutriSystem was not enough, with shares down 10.8 per cent at $56.90 as the company’s third-quarter outlook fell below analyst expectations.Corning said second-quarter net income fell 5.7 per cent on charges related to an asbestos settlement. Corning’s LCD business remained strong, while its telecommunications segment was weaker than expected. Corning shares were down 6.5 per cent at $24.48.Wellpoint posted an 11 per cent rise in second-quarter profit on Wednesday as the largest US health insurer by enrolment increased its membership from a year earlier and better controlled administrative costs.

34;GLW;Corning Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
35;GLW;Corning Inc;2007-06-10T21:24:43Z;LCD TVs turn Corning into big-screen star;;"As companies in the flat-screen television business struggle to maintain profit, Corning, the US company that supplies most of the specialist glass for these products, has looked on with satisfied detachment.Corning’s shares have more than doubled in value over the past three years and outperformed the S&P 500 by 58 per cent, driven by investor interest in its near-60 per cent share of the market for supplying the high-tech glass that goes into liquid crystal display televisions – the most popular type of flat-screen sets.Corning’s stock market value is about $40bn, nearly eight times larger than its sales last year of $5.2bn, and double the figure in 2004.Bulent Bulgurlu, chief executive of Koc, the Turkish industrial group that is a large maker of flat-screen televisions sold through its Arcelik subsidiary, said: “They [Corning] have probably got the best part of the [business in the flat-screen] industry. You can’t make LCD sets without this special glass.”The pressures on the companies that make flat-screen TV panels – Corning’s main customers for this glass – were last week highlighted by a wide-ranging alliance on areas such as technology sharing between Samsung and LG of South Korea, two of the biggest makers of these panels.Prices for panels are falling rapidly, a result of sliding prices of flat-screen televisions, as well as fierce competition among the flat-panel makers, which include Sharp of Japan and Taiwan’s AU Optronics and Chi Mei Optoelectronics.Jim Clappin, head of Corning’s display technology operations, expects flat-panel TV dimensions to continue to expand, a factor that automatically increases demand for his company’s material. In the past year, Japanese TV set makers have announced new 70-inch and even 108-inch LCD sets – well above the largest selling sizes this year of 30-45 inches. “We see a particularly big demand in China, where consumers appear to want larger and larger TV sets,” said Mr Clappin.Corning expects total LCD glass demand will grow
35-40 per cent this year, above its estimates of a few months ago. It reckons 73m LCD TVs will be sold in 2007, after 44m last year.Corning’s LCD glass sells for about $35,000 a tonne, roughly 80 times more than glass used in windows.It has to be made in special processes to exclude contaminants larger than a few micrometres [millionth of a metre]. Also, to provide the correct optical properties, the glass’s surface must not deviate up or down by more than 20 nanometres [billionths of a metre].Of the $7bn global sales of this kind of glass in 2006, Corning’s share, including that of a joint venture with Samsung, is estimated at about 58 per cent.The next biggest competitor is Asahi of Japan with a share of 20 per cent. The company bases its material on a tough form of glass that it inven­ted in 1962 for car windscreens.It has invested several hundred million dollars in developing the glass, plus more than $2bn in plants in the US, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and China.In 2006, total world production of LCD glass came to 200,000 tonnes, roughly four times higher than 2003.The total in 2008 looks likely to rise to more than 300,000 tonnes. In 2010, more than 100m LCD TVs are likely to be sold, according to industry experts."
36;GLW;Corning Inc;2007-06-10T21:24:43Z;Breaking through the glass ceiling;;For Corning, the rapid expansion in demand for liquid crystal display glass has compensated for a steep decline in demand for optical fibre – another material in which it is global leader and which propelled the company’s growth in the late 1990s.In 2006, glass for flat-screen displays accounted for 41 per cent of Corning’s sales of $5.2bn and, including Corning’s share of the profit from a joint venture with Samsung, 87 per cent of its net income of $1.8bn.The company’s total net income last year was three times higher than the $585m recorded in 2005.In 2000, when Corning’s stock price briefly rose to $113 in the height of the telecommunications boom, the company’s telecoms division (including production of optical fibre) accounted for nearly two-thirds of its net income of $1.1bn, with just 21 per cent coming from flat-screen glass.But when the telecoms bubble burst in late 2000, overcapacity on this side of the business led to a disastrous three years for Corning between 2002 and 2004.During this period, cumulative losses for the whole of the company totalled more than $3.7bn.After tumbling to below $2 in 2002, Corning’s stock price is now up to above $25, helped not just by good results for its display division but by expectations of a partial recovery in its still-weak telecoms division later this year.
37;GLW;Corning Inc;2007-04-25T21:26:01Z;Dow sets new mark on strong earnings;;Wall Street cheered a string of better-than-expected earnings and a rise in reported capital spending on Wednesday, propelling the Dow Jones Industrial Average through the 13,000 threshold for the first time.The bullish mood in stocks largely reflected upbeat corporate earnings and guidance in recent weeks.The S&P 500 closed 1 per cent higher at 1,495.42 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9 per cent at 2,547.89.Although they are at fresh six-and-a-half-year highs, the S&P and the Nasdaq are below the record levels set in March 2000, namely 1,527.46 and 5,048.62, respectively.In contrast, the Dow’s 30 large-cap stocks set a new record close of 13,089.89, a gain of 1.05 per cent and reached a high of 13,107.45 earlier in the day. The Dow Transportation and Utilities Averages also set record highs of 5,254.90 and 531.27, respectively.“The Dow tends to be tilted towards value stocks and is energy- and resource-heavy, and these areas have been doing well lately,” said Lincoln Anderson, chief investment officer at LPL Financial Services.He said the weaker dollar also provided a boost to US companies geared towards exporting or competing with imports.Of the 19 Dow companies that have so far reported first-quarter results, 13 have exceeded forecast earnings.Leading the Dow higher was Alcoa, up 5.3 per cent at $35.76 after it said it would explore the sale of its packaging and consumer businesses. Exxon Mobil gained 1.7 per cent to $79.92 amid higher oil prices and ahead of earnings due on Thursday.IBM built on its gains from Tuesday and rose 3 per cent to $101.46. The stock has risen 7.3 per cent this week, buoyed by a higher dividend and plans for $15bn in stock buy-backs.Another Dow stock, Boeing, recouped early losses and gained 1.1 per cent to $94.69 after first-quarter earnings rose 27 per cent compared with a year earlier.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the recent rise in the Dow reflected retirement accounts being opened since the tax year closed on April 15 and the belief among investors that a falling dollar would boost earnings for multinational companies.“Money is jumping into large-cap stocks as they are easy to buy and that tells me the current run is getting tired and is close to ending,” he said.The Dow’s return of 5 per cent so far this year remains adrift of the S&P’s gain of 5.4 per cent. But both benchmarks lag the 10.4 per cent rise in the S&P 400 index of medium-sized companies.The mid-cap index set a new record high of 889.52 on Wednesday and analysts said these companies are in a “sweet spot”.Some benefit from the weaker dollar boosting foreign earnings while, in general, the sector provides suitable buy-out candidates for private equity funds.“Investors are gravitating towards mid-caps’ ongoing profit momentum,” said Alec Young, equity strategist for S&P’s Equity Research.He expected that S&P 400 earnings would rise 13 per cent this year, against a 7 per cent increase for the S&P 500.The explosive rally in Amazon shares on Wednesday was its largest one-day rise since November 2001. Analysts said the surge was no surprise after its strong earnings and also reflected the limited supply of available shares. Some 70 per cent of Amazon’s stock is held by a handful of investors and short interest in the company was around 12 per cent according to Nasdaq data.Amazon also benefited from brokerage upgrades. Mark Mahaney, analyst at Citigroup upgraded Amazon to a ‘Hold’ from a ‘Sell’ and said “a key part of our ‘Sell’ thesis no longer holds” namely that the company “had seen the likely end of margin boosts from third party sales…and we were wrong.”As earnings season continued, PepsiCo said first-quarter profit rose 16 per cent and the company affirmed its guidance for this year. Its stock rose 0.9 per cent to $66.98.ConocoPhillips said its first-quarter profit rose 7.7 per cent, with income from asset sales offsetting lower commodity prices and higher operating costs. The oil group’s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $70.82.Apple, the computer maker, rose 2.3 per cent to $95.35, ahead of earnings due out after the closing bell. Apple said fiscal second quarter profits jumped 88 per cent and beat estimates, amid strong sales of its iPod music players and Macintosh computers. In after-hours trade, shares had risen 7.7 per cent to $102.69.Shares in Corning rose 5.3 per cent to $24.98 after its first-quarter profit jumped 27 per cent.Sun Microsystems tumbled 11.3 per cent to $5.27 after its sales growth missed expectations, in spite of the computer server maker swinging to a small profit in the fiscal third quarter ending April 1.Shares in Eastman Kodak rose 9.2 per cent to $26.23.
38;GLW;Corning Inc;2007-04-25T21:21:18Z;Corning signals fibre revival;;"Corning said on Wednesday it would partially reopen an optical fibre manufacturing plant it had mothballed five years ago, amid signs of the most significant revival in demand for the material since the telecommunications bubble burst seven years ago.The planned reopening of the North Carolina facility marks the gradual recovery of a market that turned the US high-tech glass company into one of the hottest stocks at the tail end of the tech bubble, only to see its fortunes crash as the telecoms sector retreated in the face of overcapacity in long-distance fibre-optic networks. Besides mothballing one of its six factories, Corning closed three others for good as it struggled to stay afloat.The fibre market has grown 15 per cent in volume terms in each of the past two years, Corning said, with most of the new demand coming from local access and city-wide networks. This reflects a push by cable and telecoms companies to boost broadband capacity by bringing fibre closer to their customers’ premises.Optical fibre sales were an unexpected bright spot in Corning’s first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, contributing to revenues above forecast and a 5 per cent jump in the company’s shares in early trading. That balanced out a weaker quarter in the company’s new core business of manufacturing glass for
liquid crystal displays.Sales from Corning’s telecoms division rose 11 per cent in the quarter to $439m.LCD sales fell to $524m, a fall of 4 per cent from a year before, when Corning was boosted by an unusually rapid build-up in inventory by makers of LCD displays. The company’s overall sales of $1.31bn topped forecasts of $1.29bn, while pro-forma earnings per share, the basis on which Wall Street judges the company, were 2 cents ahead of estimate."
39;GLW;Corning Inc;2007-01-26T21:40:10Z;Wall Street down on higher rates, volatile oil;;"US stocks were not for the faint-hearted this week. Sentiment swung wildly as investors got to grips with mixed results and guidance from several companies, volatile oil prices and rising bond yields.The Vix index, a market measure of volatility, reflected this. It swung from a low of 9.87 to a peak of 11.60 on Friday, and rose 7 per cent for the week.After setting a six-year high during the week, the S&P 500 retreated on Friday to close at 1,422.18, down 0.1 per cent on the day and 0.6 per cent over the five days as Treasury yields reached their highest levels in five months.“Rising rates are an expression of economic strength,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader. But he said such strength ran counter to the Federal Reserve’s “soft landing” scenario and had “upset” investors.A clear trend this month has been the desire of investors to snap up recent underperformers if their earnings exceeded expectations.Jack Caffrey, senior equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said: “People are afraid of missing out, and when they hear good news they want to boost their portfolios with stocks that promise out-performance.”The situation was illustrated this week when Ebay beat earnings and raised guidance for 2007. The online auctioneer rose 6.8 per cent to $31.65, having fallen
30 per cent during the previous 12 months.Better than expected earnings from Yahoo boosted its shares by 1.4 per cent to $28.04 this week. After tumbling 35 per cent in 2006, the stock has risen 10 per cent this month. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,435.49 on Friday, a loss of 0.65 per cent for the week. A drag on the Nasdaq was Amgen, the biotechnology company, whose shares fell 3.7 per cent on the week to $71.50, after earnings failed to beat estimates.Other technology companies moving higher amid better earnings and guidance this week included Sun MicroSystems, up 9.7 per cent to $6.33, RF Micro Devices, up 13 per cent to $7.85, and Citrix Systems, up 8 per cent at $31.10. Microsoft beat earnings estimates but fell 1.6 per cent to $30.60 after setting a multi-year high of $31.48 on Thursday.Advanced Micro Devices, slid 8.5 per cent to $16.22 after the chipmaker missed its earnings estimates. Sun also said it would use chips from Intel in its servers, a move that could erode maket share for AMD said analysts.In contrast, Texas Instruments rose 9.3 per cent to $31.02 as the chipmaker produced stellar earnings. Shares in Corning surged 9.7 per cent to $21.20 after the maker of glass and fibre optics products also beat estimates.Blackstone increased its offer for Equity Office to $54 from $48.50 a share as it countered a rival buy-out offer of $52 a share. Shares in Equity Office rose 5.2 per cent to $55.22 this week.Countrywide jumped 4.2 per cent, to $42 on Friday after the Financial Times reported that the mortgage lender was in talks with Bank Of America about a possible $30bn deal. BofA shares fell 0.7 per cent to $52.04 on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average set a record close during the week, only to retreat. It fell 0.1 per cent to 12,487.02 on Friday, a loss of 0.6 per cent over the week.AT&T led Dow constituents reporting earnings this week. Better revenue growth sparked a 3.8 per cent rise to $36.40 and shares hit a multi-year high of $37.70 on Thursday.Caterpillar shares rose 2.5 per cent to $61.09 on Friday after it raised sales guidance for 2007.McDonald’s weighed on the Dow as its shares slid 4.2 per cent to $42.93. Its quarterly earnings met estimates that were recently upgraded and had sent the stock to a multi-year peak of $45.06 more than a week ago. Topping the Dow this week was General Motors, up 4.4 per cent to $32.93, although the stock fell from a peak of $33.30 after it announced a delay in filing its fourth-quarter earnings.The company reiterated that it expected to be profitable in the fourth quarter of 2006.In stark contrast, Ford announced an annual loss of $12.7bn, the largest in its
history. The shares rose 1.4 per cent to $8.42.Analysts at Gimme Credit said Ford had managed investor expectations well: “We all know this is just the first quarter in what will be a gruelling, physical game.”"

The Fed confirmed that the economy is neither too hot not too cold.”General Motors, the world’s largest carmaker, was firmly in the spotlight after it reported a narrower third quarter loss and a $529m, or 93 cents a share, profit. Analysts had expected a rebound in profit to 49 cents a share.GM shares were down 4.1 per cent, or $1.48, at $34.71 at the close, as analysts said the market continued to be concerned about its market share.

43;GLW;Corning Inc;2006-07-28T20:43:31Z;Wall Street jumps on positive earnings;;Wall Street jumped sharply on Friday as investors took heart from another week of mostly strong earnings and hopes that the US Federal Reserve might be closer to calling a halt to the current cycle of interest rate rises.The big stock market indices had their best week in six months.General Motors gained in spite of reporting a $3.2bn quarterly loss due to charges from the carmaker’s employee buy-out programme. Excluding the charges, GM’s operating profit was $1.2bn, better than analysts had expected, pushing shares up 11.6 per cent over the week to a 10-month high of $32.35.Ford was pulled up 9.7 per cent to $6.89 on the news. The S&P car manufacturing index is now at its highest level since November.It was a good week for pharmaceuticals. Merck rose 10.1 per cent to $41.12 after it raised its outlook for 2006 and reported that profit nearly doubled in the second quarter. Generic drug maker Mylan Laboratories added 15.2 per cent to $22.00 as quarterly earnings rose 76 per cent. Pfizer gained 9.6 per cent to $26.11. Pfizer and Merck have been the best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in July.AT&T reported an 81 per cent rise in second quarter earnings boosted by its Cingular Wireless unit. Its shares rose 9.9 per cent for the week to $30.06.Corning lost 12.6 per cent to $19.13 after it warned that sales in the third quarter would fall short of analysts’ expectations due to a build-up in stocks of its liquid crystal display glass, used in computer monitors and television screens. The news overshadowed a tripling of profit in the second quarter.Oil services companies posted strong advances, buoyed by robust earnings from continued high oil prices. Nabors Industries added 15.7 per cent to $34.00, after announcing a 77 per cent increase in quarterly profit, while BJ Services increased quarterly profit by 86 per cent, pushing shares up 15.8 per cent to $34.80.ExxonMobil added 4.8 per cent to $67.00 after it reported more than $10bn in quarterly profit, a quarterly gain of 36 per cent.At the close on Friday, the S&P500 was up 3.1 per cent for the week, at 1,278.55, its best week since January. It was 1.2 per cent, or 15.35 points, higher for the day.The Nasdaq Composite added 1.9 per cent, or 39.67 points on the day, and was 3.7 per cent higher for the week at 2,094.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.1 per cent or 113.88 points higher on the day at 11,219.70, a weekly gain of 3.2 per cent - its best week since May 2005.“Second quarter earnings results have come in better than expected, although forward guidance for the third quarter of 2006 has been disappointing at best,” said Henry McVey, chief US investment strategist at Morgan Stanley in a note to investors.“We are definitely seeing higher ratios of negative to positive [third quarter forecasts],” said John Butters, senior research analyst at Thomson Financial, who says the proportion of negative forecasts is now at its highest level in two years.According to Thomson, the blended year-on-year growth rate for second quarter earnings now stands at 14.8 per cent, up from 13.6 per cent last week. With only about a third of the S&P 500 still to report, earnings are on track for a twelfth consecutive quarter of double digit gains.Online retailer Amazon fell precipitously after it reported a 58 per cent drop in quarterly earnings. The stock fell 18.1 per cent to $27.17 on the news, its lowest level in more than three years. It is down 42 per cent since the start of the year.It was not all bad news for the technology sector. Sandisk, maker of flash memory chips for mobile phones and digital cameras, beat analyst forecasts with a 36 per cent increase in quarterly profit, pushing shares up 25.7 per cent to $47.14.Graphics chip maker Nvidia added 27.6 per cent to $22.67 on news that its main competitor ATI Technologies would be bought by Advanced Micro Devices.Health insurer Aetna slashed its forecast for membership growth for 2006 as it reported a 1 per cent drop in quarterly earnings. Investors were also nervous about rising medical costs. This triggered a sell-off that pushed the stock down 17.5 per cent to $32.17.United Parcel Service lost 11.1 per cent to $70.01 after its quarterly profits fell shy of analyst estimates and the company warned that full-year earnings would be at the low-end of forecasts.
44;GLW;Corning Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Market Overview: Fed’s report of mild inflationary pressure fails to lift drifting Dow;;"The publication by the US Federal Reserve’s beige book, which compiles anecdotal evidence on the health of the US economy from around the country, on Wednesday failed to lift stock markets at the end of another day of uncertainty over the outlook for corporate earnings and the economy.The beige book surprised the market both with stronger evidence of an economic slowdown than had been expected and with relatively little evidence of inflationary pressures. It said: “Increases in wages and in prices of final goods and services remained modest on net.” It added: “A few districts noted a moderation in prices for some items.”This appeared to reduce the chances of a rate rise at the Fed’s meeting next month. The futures market moved to put the probability of a rise at 47 per cent, while two-year Treasury bond yields dropped 4.3 basis points to 5.08 per cent.But the news did not spark a rally for stocks. By the close, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were flat, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2 per cent.A strong second-quarter earnings season was again overshadowed by disappointments by high-profile, large companies.Amazon was the latest bellwether stock to disappoint after it reported a sharp fall in second-quarter earnings and cut its forecast for the full year. This added to concerns that the US economy was slowing.There were also disappointments in the results of Corning, a maker of liquid crystal display components, and Boeing, which had not been as optimistic on its outlook for 2007 as anticipated.These disappointments were offset by better-than-expected numbers from ConocoPhillips and General Motors. Thomson Financial said these two companies helped spur a sharp jump in the expected second-quarter earnings growth for the S&P 500 companies based on consensus forecasts.Thomson said the blended estimated growth rate – reported numbers plus forecast figures – had risen to 15.1 per cent from 10.9 per cent at the start of the quarter. Thomson added that of the 246 S&P 500 companies to have reported second-
quarter results so far, 68 per cent posted earnings above expectations, 17 per cent reported in line with forecasts and 15 per cent disappointed. The positive surprise rate compared with a long-term average of 60 per cent and a more recent average of 66 per cent.For the full year, the forecast earnings growth for the S&P 500 constituents was 14.1 per cent. The expected growth for next year was 10.5 per cent.In Europe, shares shrugged off mixed earnings results, the third profit warning in a year from Peugeot and data showing a fall in German business confidence. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 5.28 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 1,320.81.The Munich-based Ifo institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of around 7,000 firms, fell to 105.6 from 106.8 in June. The fall in the index was the largest since March 2005.“The first cracks are starting to appear in Germany’s business confidence boom,” said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns. “After recently notching up a fresh 15-year high in June it looked like a correction in Ifo confidence was long overdue.”The dip in the Ifo index did little to dent expectations that the ECB will raise interest rates by a quarter-point to 3 per cent next week. Yields on 10-year Bunds rose 1.4 basis points to 3.977 per cent."
45;GLW;Corning Inc;2006-07-26T21:12:33Z;Wall Street unmoved by mixed earnings;;Wall Street closed flat on Wednesday as investors were pulled in opposite directions by economic data and mixed earnings reports.Stocks moved sideways most of the morning, but ticked higher following the afternoon release of the Fed’s beige book, a report on regional economic conditions that suggested price pressures in the US were contained.Markets took the news as making it less likely that the Fed would raise interest rates at its next meeting. However, the rally was not enough to distract investors from disappointing earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Corning and others.At the close, the S&P 500 was flat, down 0.48 points, at 1,268.40, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2 per cent, or 3.44 points, at 2,070.46. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also flat, down 1.20 points, at 11,102.51.General Motors reported a net loss of $3.2bn in the second quarter as charges related to the carmaker’s employee buyout programme took a heavy financial toll. But operating earnings were $1.2bn, ahead of analyst estimates, pushing shares 4.4 per cent higher to $32.00.Online retailer Amazon reported a 58 percen fall in quarterly earnings. Shares plunged 21.8 per cent to $26.26, their lowest level in more than three years.However, other technology stocks did better. Apple Computer gained 3.1 per cent to $63.87 and Sun Microsystems rose 4.4 per cent to $4.27 after reporting an increase in quarterly revenue.Corning fell 14.5 per cent to $18.52 after it warned that third-quarter sales would miss analysts’ forecasts. The company was hit by sluggish sales of its liquid-crystal-display glass, used in television screens and mobile phones. The stock is down more than a third since early May.“We’re not selling,” said Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at US Trust, whose fund owns Corning.“Corning is in an enviable position in the market. Our belief is that by the end of the September quarter the inventory glut will have been rebalanced and set the stage for renewed growth.”ConocoPhilips led a rally in oil stocks, rising 1.7 per cent to a three-month high of $68.60 after it announced profits had risen 65 per cent on higher crude prices.Boeing dipped 4.6 per cent to $79.90 after it reported a quarterly loss – in line with expectations – caused by charges related to a settlement of government investigations into its defence business.Rockwell Automation, maker of industrial automation products, fell as investors took fright at narrowing margins and the shares lost 10.2 per cent to $60.50.The transport sector continued to retreat. Rail group Norfolk Southern sparked the sell-off after it fell short of analyst estimates with a 12 per cent drop in quarterly earnings. The stock lost 8.5 per cent to $41.40.
46;GLW;Corning Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;LCD screen glut hits Corning;;Shares in Corning fell by around 10 per cent in early trading on Wednesday after the US glassmaker warned that the recent global inventory glut of LCD screens may take longer to work off than investors had hoped.Coming from the company that is estimated to supply more than half of all the glass used in LCD screens, the cautious comments are likely to hit the mostly Asian companies that dominate the market for finished screens.“Inventory levels did come down” in recent weeks, “but they’re not down to the levels we came into this year at,” said Jim Flaws, Corning’s chief financial officer.Speaking in an interview after the US company released its second quarter results, Mr Flaws said Corning had decided to project an unusually wide range of 5-15 per cent sequential revenue growth for the present quarter. “That range really reflects some of the uncertainty we feel today about how fast demand will snap back up,” he said.He added that the risk that high energy costs and rising interest rates would start to weigh on demand for its products had also contributed to the company’s more cautious stance.Excess inventory in the LCD supply-chain normally cleared quickly as screen makers cut their prices, Mr Flaws said. Corning believed the longer period needed to reduce the current build-up could reflect the more mature state of the computer monitor market, where some 80 per cent of screens sold are already LCDs and where price elasticity may no longer be as pronounced, he added.The US company, which supplies more than half of the glass used to make the LCD displays that go into computer monitors and TVs, predicted revenues of $1.26bn-$1.33bn for the coming quarter, below the $1.41bn that Wall Street has been expecting.For the most second quarter of the year, it reported a 13 cent slump in the volume of glass shipped by its wholly owned LCD operations in the second quarter compared with the preceding three months. However, thanks to a more resilient performance from a joint venture glassmaking operation with Samsung, whose LCD sales have held up better than many in the industry in recent weeks, the US company was able to limit the overall fall in LCD glass to 6 per cent, compared with a downbeat estimate of a decline of 0-5 per cent it issued in May.Corning reported an 11 per cent increase in revenues to $1.26bn for the second quarter, below the $1.32bn that the market had expected. The shortfall was limited by a better-than-expected jump in sales of optical fibre to telecommunications companies. Earnings of 32 cents a share, or 26 cents excluding certain one-time items, were in line with forecasts.
47;GLW;Corning Inc;2006-07-10T20:56:46Z;Wall Street steady in spite of tech slump;;"Technology stocks were hit on Monday by a sell-off in the Nasdaq that was exacerbated by light trading volume.Consumer staples and retail stocks bounced however, aided by deals, news and strong earnings.By the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent, or 1.86 points, at 1,267.34, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.6 per cent, or 13.13 points, at 2,116.93. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent, or 12.88 points, at 11,103.55.“We got some of the macro-economic data out of the way last week and now people will be focusing on earnings,” said Philip Roth, chief technical market analyst at Miller Tabak.Brian Williamson, equity trader at Boston Company Asset Management, said the weak trading volume was giving rise to considerable swings in stock prices.“There was very light volume today, and moves tend to be fairly exaggerated when volume is light,” he said.An unhealthy pallor on technology stocks weighed on the Nasdaq. EMC fell
6.9 per cent to $10.41 after the maker of data storage equipment said second-quarter profits and revenues would not reach forecasts.Sandisk was off 8.2 per cent to $43.56 while Hewlett Packard, a strong gainer in recent weeks, dropped 2.8 per cent to $31.93.Corning, maker of liquid crystal glass displays, fell 5.3 per cent to $20.97. The stock has shed more than 27 per cent since April.Athletic shoe retailer Foot Locker leapt 10 per cent to $27.32 following reports that the private equity group Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, might bid for the company.Other retailers also did well. Gap added 5.7 per cent to $17.57, its best day since November 2004. Drugstore chain CVS added 2.8 per cent to $31.31 after it reported a better than expected 8.4 per cent gain in same-store sales in June, driven by prescription medications.CVS rival Rite Aid gained 4 per cent to $4.40 on the news, and Walgreens was up 1.9 per cent to $46.73.Consumer staples made strong advances on the back of a sector upgrade by Merrill Lynch. Kellogg rose 1.9 per cent to $48.45, and Conagra jumped 2 per cent to $22.29. An upgrade from JPMorgan pushed Tyson Foods up 5.7 per cent to $15.28. The stock was raised from “neutral” to “overweight”.Oil dropped below $74 on optimism regarding talks between Iran and the European Union that begin this week. The slide in crude boosted airline stocks, with AMR, parent of American Airways, gaining 3.3 per cent to $27.66, while Southwest gained 2.3 per cent to $17.37 on hopes of cheaper fuel.Softer crude prices did not feed through to oil services group Schlumberger, however, which rose 1.2 per cent to $63.50 after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock from $66 to $75."
48;GLW;Corning Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Wall Street dips as crude fall hits oil majors;;Wall Street closed lower for a third consecutive day on Wednesday as lower crude oil prices sparked a sell-offof energy stocks while failing to instill confidence in investors.The news forced the Dow Jones Industrial Average below 11,000 points, for its lowest close in more than three months.Philip Roth, chief technical market analyst at Miller Tabak, believes the market is continuing to be rattled by the lack of volume in the market when it rallies.“Since it made its lows on the 23rd and 24th of May, rallies have been very weak, with not much volume. Once again, today it tried to rally, and volume dipped off. There’s very little evidence of investment buying [in the market],” he said.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent, or 7.70 points, at 1,256.15, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5 per cent, or 10.98 points, at 2,151.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent, or 71.24 points, at 10,930.90.Oil pulled back from its highs, dipping more than a dollar a barrel, as data showed increased inventories of crude and gasoline. The fall in prices fed through to energy companies, with Schlumberger dipping 5.4 per cent to $61.97, its worst day since February. ChevronTexaco was down4 per cent to $57.17.The health sector was pulled higher after GlaxoSmithKline’s statement that it was interested in buying Pfizer’s consumer unit “at the right price”. Pfizer gained 0.3 per cent to $23.91, while Abbott Laboratories rose 1.6 per cent to $43.05.Corning fell 8.7 per cent to $21.95 after new research linked asbestos to cancer of the larynx. Last month Corning restated a part of its 2005 financial results that concerned an asbestos settlement.Retailers posted gains, led by Target, which added2.7 per cent to $48.90. Supermarket Supervalu rose1.6 per cent to $29.29, while Kroger gained 0.6 per cent to $19.86.Consumer products were boosted as investors sought shelter in defensive stocks. Molson Coors jumped 3.3 per cent to $67.94 and Colgate Palmolive gained 0.9 per cent to $60.73. Colgate Palmolive has gained more than 11 per cent since March.“We are seeing some investors looking at consumer stocks,” said Chris Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, who attributed this to a defensive stance by investors.Chemicals companies were bruised by a downgrade. Dupont and Dow Chemical were both dropped from “buy” to “hold” by Deutsche Bank. Dupont fell 2.6 per cent to $41.09 and Dow Chemical dropped 1.3 per cent to $39.08.L-3 Communications rose 4.7 per cent to $76.93, as the death of chief executive Frank Lanza on Tuesday sparked takeover talk.
49;GLW;Corning Inc;2006-05-22T21:52:33Z;Wall Street slides as rate fears weigh;;Wall Street turned lower on Monday as interest rate fears continued to weigh on sentiment and investors remained skittish over falls in European and Asian markets.NYSE Group was closely watched by investors as the exchange made its bid for control of Euronext.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent, or 4.96 points, to 1,262.07, at one point in the session dipping into negative territory for the year, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 1 per cent, or 21.02 points, to 2,172.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent, or 18.73 points, at 11,125.33.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 0.5 per cent. It has lost more than 8 per cent in two weeks, an indication of the comparatively greater pressure smaller companies face when interest rates threaten to rise further.The Vix, the most widely used index of US equity market volatility, remained near one-year highs – an indication of growing risk aversion on the part of investors.“The Vix is up quite sharply, but it’s coming from a 10-year low,” said Philip Roth, chief technical market analyst at Miller Tabak.“It’s not even as high as it was during a mild setback in 2004.”Trading was brisk in exchange stocks after NYSE Group outlined details of its $10.2bn offer to buy Euro-next. NYSE fell 2.6 per cent to $62.85. Nasdaq, which has been buying up shares in the London Stock Exchange, was down 5 per cent to $31.40 on the news, its lowest level since October 2005.Lowe’s, the home-improvement retailer, fell 4.5 per cent to $59.82 despite reporting better than expected quarterly profit. The company revised its 2006 profit forecast downward slightly and said a housing slowdown could provide a headwind for the company.New contracts between mining companies and steel-makers locked in hefty price increases for iron ore, depressing steel makers. Nucor was down 4.5 per cent to $100.25 and US Steel fell 5 per cent to $60.82.Investment banks suffered as interest rate fears took hold. Bear Stearns dropped 2.4 per cent to $128.68 and Goldman Sachs fell 2.2 per cent to $146.15.Corning skidded 4.9 per cent to $23.29 after it said it would ship lower volumes of its liquid crystal display glass, which is used in televisions and computer monitors.Semiconductors also slumped, led by National Semiconductors which was downgraded by Piper Jaffray from “out perform” to “market perform”, sliding 4.7 per cent to $26.33. Advanced Micro Devices followed suit, shedding 5.1 per cent to $33.18.Other tech stocks fared better. Yahoo gained 3.2 per cent to $30.46 following an upbeat assessment of the stock from Barron’s. Microsoft added 1.4 per cent to $22.88 on the day it launched a cheaper pre-paid licensing system for its software.
50;GLW;Corning Inc;2006-05-11T21:19:25Z;Wall Street slides amid heavy tech sell-off;;Wall Street suffered substantial falls on Thursday as rising commodity prices and a severe sell-off in the technology sector dragged the main indices lower. Small companies were especially hurt, with the Russell 2000 index falling more than 2 per cent.“The reason the market is down could be twofold,” said Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors. “The first could be that the Federal Reserve has already raised interest rates too high. I’m hoping that’s not the case but it could be.“The second is that if the Fed has not raised short-term interest rates too high, they’re close to making that mistake. Markets believe there’s a chance of interest rates going to 5.25 per cent because of rising commodity prices.”Chris Johnson, director of Quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, who believes rising yields, higher oil prices and geopolitical uncertainty in Iran are combining to create a “trinity of uncertainty”, said: “Its clear to most people the uncertainty around interest rates was not resolved, and the market does not like uncertainty.“You also had a market near the top of a run. It just presented a good moment for investors to sell.”At the bell, the S&P 500 was down 1.3 per cent, or 16.93 points, at 1,305.92, with the Nasdaq Composite down 2.1 per cent, or 48.04 points, at 2,272.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.2 per cent, or 141.92 points, to 11,500.73.Tech stocks drove the slump on Wall Street, with the S&P Software Services Index down 2.3 per cent and the S&P Technology, Hardware and Equipment index down 2.5 per cent.Google led the slump shedding 4 per cent to $387. The internet search company admitted that its software engineers had spent less than 70 per cent of their time on research related to the company’s core search business.Cisco Systems continued its slide from Wednesday, losing 3.4 per cent to $20.05, Apple was down 3.5 per cent at $68.15 and Yahoo shed 2.9 per cent at $31.15.One of the biggest fallers outside the tech sector was American International Group, which dipped 5.1 per cent to $63.15. After the bell on Wednesday, AIG reported first-quarter earnings that were 5 per cent below Wall Street’s expectations. AIG’s shares have fallen more than 10 per cent this year.News Corporation jumped 3 per cent to $19.69 after strong third-quarter earnings, with earnings per share 30 per cent above analyst estimates.It announced it would double its share buyback from $3bn to $6bn. The stock is at its highest level since February 2004.Corning, the maker of glass for LCD computers and televisions, fell 5.3 per cent to $25.74.

51;GLW;Corning Inc;2006-01-16T18:36:39Z;Book review: Good parenting guide for innovators;;"10 Rules for Strategic Innovators - From Idea to Execution
By Vijay Govindarajan and Chris Trimble
Harvard Business School Press, £17.99Say what you like about Donald Rumsfeld, US defence ­secretary, but he has, perhaps unwittingly, provided a definitive summary of the challenges facing risk-taking, innovative ­companies.“As we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don’t know we don’t know.”Precisely. But try telling that to shareholders when your latest new venture has crashed and you are likely to be met with blank looks.At the start of a new year businesses are urged to renew their efforts to be more innovative. But as Vijay Govindarajan and Chris Trimble show in their book, the desire to innovate is only the first step in a long and arduous management journey, punctuated by unknown unknowns. Finding new ideas may not be the problem. Putting them into practice is.Govindarajan and Trimble, professors at the Tuck School of Business in Dartmouth, New Hampshire, have studied dozens of new ventures at Fortune 500 companies, including Corning, Hasbro, Unilever and Cisco, tracing the successes and failures. They have emerged after several years of research with a theory of strategic innovation and a 10-point checklist of steps to make innovation work.The essential lessons are these: businesses need to establish new ventures in a clear corporate context, borrow intelligently from the parent company, ignore any irrelevant legacy practices, learn constantly from new experiences and regularly adjust their plans and forecasts – all this while under the spotlight of an impatient yet cautious board.No wonder so many new businesses are abandoned. Parent companies launch businesses that are badly designed and fail to adapt to new circumstances, or that fall short of unrealistic ­forecasts.From the outset we need to distinguish between four types of innovation, the authors say.First is basic innovation, brought about by continuous improvement of processes. This can be put into effect very quickly. Then there is a process “revolution”, which takes longer. The third type of innovation involves actual products or services, an even more drawn-out process. The fourth type – the theme of this book – “strategic innovation”, the biggest experiment or bet, may take years to play out and its results can be the most ambiguous and difficult to evaluate.As the authors say: “We choose to focus on strategic innovation because the long-term survival of a company depends on it more than ever before, and because it is perhaps the most devilishly difficult.”The three main pillars of the authors’ approach – their prescription for strategic innovation – are forgetting, borrowing and learning. The new business has to recast its strategy and forget inherited orthodoxies. Its new business model may require different competencies from its leaders. And it must resist the temptation to exploit existing customers, and instead explore new sources of demand.New “organisational DNA” – staff, structures, systems and culture – is required. Copying the parent will not work. A new venture is typically a more creative, flatter organisation with a stronger appetite for risk, the authors say. Pay is tied more closely to performance.Crucially, the new business has to learn. “One learning curve matters more than any other for NewCo: improvement in predictions of its business performance,” the authors say.This is where so many go wrong. As one Corning manager said, describing the heady days of the late 90s technology boom: “It seemed as though everything was growing at 70 per cent per year. So if you didn’t project $250m in five years, you heard: ‘guys, not enough zeroes’.”Having plucked figures out of the air as a target, managers regard these figures as holy writ. “Leaders must react differently to disparities between predictions and outcomes,” the authors say. Trends, not targets, matter most. “Falling short of plan should not immediately be viewed as failing.”Political tensions may arise, with enemies of the new venture disparaging its performance. For this reason Govindarajan and Trimble recommend that the head of “NewCo” should report to an “unconventionally high point within the corporation” – to an executive more senior than the managing director or chief operating officer of “CoreCo”.Innovate or die, we are often told. “Innovate and die” is the frequent outcome of badly planned and badly managed ventures. This book’s sensible suggestions offer innovators a better route map through the unknown unknowns of future competition."
52;GLW;Corning Inc;2005-09-29T17:44:49Z;A careful giant behind the glass;;"It takes a confident manager to admit that his company’s new $250m manufacturing plant might not work properly. “We don’t know for sure that we can make products from the plant in the volumes we need, nor that the products will function in exactly the way we want them to,” says Wendell Weeks, chief executive of Corning, the US glass and ceramics maker.In spite of Mr Weeks’ caution, Corning’s 150 years of innovation experience have helped it become the world’s biggest maker of glass for flat screens. As well as ­pioneering technology by consistently investing in research and development, the company has embraced novel business strategies such as extracting “down payments” from customers to shield itself from market shocks.Corning’s new building is a high-tech factory in New York state that will turn out ceramic material to filter hazardous particulates from diesel engines. Assuming teething problems can be overcome, the company thinks the plant, employing just 250 people, could make products worth up to $1bn a year by 2009.In the case of the filters, Corning – for all Mr Weeks’s words of caution – is reasonably confident it is on to a winner, having spent much of the past decade developing the honeycomb-type substance the products will be based on. But Mr Weeks does his best to stress that commercialising the technology is unlikely to be easy.“There is a degree of ­technology risk about most things we do,” says Mr Weeks. “At any one time we are examining a series of new ideas but we know that probably half of them won’t work.”This way of working is endemic to Corning, a company whose long-term record of coming up with innovative products is one of the most impressive in the world. Since starting in 1851, it has been a technology leader in a number of key areas – from light bulbs to television sets.“Over the decades Corning has kept a strong commitment to materials engineering specifically linked to glass ; it has invested continually in R and D and has managed to re-invent itself several times through using its technical expertise to move into new product fields,” says Nikos Theodosopoulos, an analyst at the New York office of the UBS investment bank.The continuity of XXXthis way of working is exemplified by James Houghton, chairman of the company, who was the chief executive from 1983 to 1996 and is the great - great grandson of the company’s founder.In the past two years, Corning’s stock price has healthily outperformed other companies listed on Wall Street as it has emerged as the world’s ­biggest maker of high-purity glass for flat-screen ­televisions and computer monitors.Corning is expected to produce about 60 per cent of the glass required for liquid-crystal displays this year, far ahead of its closest rival, Asahi Glass of Japan, whose market share is about 20 per cent.The method for making the glass did not appear overnight; in fact, it is based on a process devised by the company 40 years ago for producing car windscreens – a product that Corning subsequently dropped.“We spent 14 years working on LCD glass without making any money out of it,” says the 46-year-old Mr Weeks, who started work in Corning 22 years ago and took over as chief executive in April.Although he has a financial background, Mr Weeks says it is technological curiosity that drives the company. It must also be nimble enough, he says, to use basic technical ideas to push into new markets. For instance, over the years Corning has used its skills in glass chemistry to develop products including cookware and laboratory instrumentation as well as TV screens.We try to be aware of the technical drivers that are affecting our customers’ businesses. We want to understand the basic technology of glass and ceramics as deeply as we can,” says Mr Weeks. “Also we always try to invent not just new products, but the technical process that will make new products ­possible.”According to a book* published four years ago that examined Corning’s management methods , the company has an extremely long-sighted view of technology, keeping new ideas in “an active or near-active” state until the right opportunity comes along. But if patience is a vital part of Corning’s internal process, a certain amount of forbearance is required on the part of investors.The company’s patient approach to innovation requires a certain amount of forbearance on the part of investors. As recently as 2000, the company was a stock market star as its shares soared on the back of another area in which it is a world leader – optical fibres for telecommunications, where it is one of the two biggest players along with Lucent, also of the US. ­However, as the telecoms bubble burst in 2002, the stock crashed to earth – falling from more than $100 to $1 in two years.That episode may explain why Corning sounds cautious about the new areas of technology it wants to commercialise. Mr Weeks is far from ebullient about the new ideas in diesel filters – just one of several areas of development that he thinks could lead to big growth opportunities in the next decade.Other ideas in the pipeline include lasers for optical communications; diagnostics techniques that could have applications in the biosciences field; and “micro-reactors” – small-scale mechanisms for making specialised substances to order, which could be used in the chemicals industry.All these are based around Corning’s expertise in materials engineering – a field that accounts for most of the company’s research and development budget. This is likely to be about $450m this year, or roughly 10 per cent of Corning’s total revenues. Of the company’s overall sales, about 80 per cent comes from its two main fields of LCD glass and optical fibres, with each of these accounting for a similar proportion. It is difficult to overlook the potential for the LCD glass business. Televisions based on this technology are becoming increasingly popular; Mr Weeks reckons 10 per cent of the 150m TVs likely to be sold this year will feature flat screens, compared with just 5 per cent last year.Yet Corning is anxious to contain its customers’ enthusiasm for new flat-screen investments – it does not want a flat-screen “bubble” to match the earlier telecommunications bubble. In the past two years it has charged several of its customers sizeable down payments for its investments in new LCD glass fabrication plants – a practice that is unheard of in many other industries. Contributors include the main manufacturers of flat-screen panels such as the Korean/Dutch venture LG Philips and the Taiwanese businesses AU Optronics and Chi Mei.“Between the start of 2004 and the end of 2005 we are likely to have spent nearly $2bn on new glass manufacturing facilities, mainly in Japan and Taiwan,” says Mr Weeks. “Nearly half our investment has come in the form of deposits [paying in advance] for future glass shipments from some of our customers. In this way, we are forcing them to review their own plans on selling panels and encourage them to be realistic about their own sales targets.”While C. J. Muse, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, applauds the effort to dampen exuberance in the LCD market, he also stresses the strong technological position that has given ­Corning the opportunity to demand such down payments in the first place.One reason why customers have been happy to pay up front is that they wanted to lock in supplies of the materials which have been difficult to procure from other sources.Mr Muse reckons that Corning is ahead of its competitors in being able to produce the ultra-large sheets of LCD glass on which the TV panel industry is increasingly relying as flat-screen TVs gradually get bigger.“It’s difficult to think of any other company in any other industry that has such a strong competitive advantage in technology in a specific field and which is likely to keep it over the next five to 10 years,” says Mr Muse.* Corning and the Craft of Innovation by Margaret Graham and Alec Shuldiner, Oxcorf University PressCORNING’S TIMELINE OF INNOVATION1851 Company starts in Massachusetts, moving soon afterwards to Corning, New York state1908 Starts corporate research and development lab, one of the first in the world1912 Devises heat-resistant Pyrex glass1926 Invents machines to make light-bulb blanks1947 Comes up with a form of near-unbreakable glass for cookware1950s Moves into making glass for cathode-ray TV tubes1964 Finds a way to make highly pure, ultra-smooth glass for car windscreens – honing techniques that are used later in glass for flat-screen televisions1970 Invents low-loss optical fibre that transmits light with need for amplification (to boost light intensity) kept to a minimum1997 Produces one of the biggest pieces of glass ever made(for an astronomical telescope) – measuring roughly 8 metres in diameter2000s Moves into glass for liquid-crystal displaysSHATTERING RECORDSCorning, the US glassmaker, has a strong record on innovation.

Both high quality stocks and struggling companies on the index made gains.Intel, which is due to report its results tomorrow, was up 1.5 per cent at $28.64 and Apple climbed 2.5 per cent to $42.51. Among the strugglers, Corning was up 4.5 per cent at $18.29 and Gateway advanced 3.2 per cent to $3.85.After a day in the doldrums on Monday, the three main indicators were all up. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was almost 1 per cent up at 2,165.07. The S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent, taking it to 1,225.85, while the Dow Jones industrial average was 0.5 per cent up at 10,630.Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach, said that the day’s strong results had defied pessimistic predictions by investors.“There was a feeling out there that higher energy costs would erode earnings in the second quarter. That appears to be wrong. While it is still early days in the earnings season, it looks like companies are coping with higher oil prices.”International Paper, the forest-products company, gained 10.8 per cent to $33.98 after it said it planned to spin off some businesses. The news stirred other paper industry stocks, including Georgia Pacific, which gained 6.1 per cent to $34.05.Merrill Lynch also had good earnings news for investors. Its better-than-expected results sent the bank’s shares up 2.6 per cent to $58.13. Weyerhaeuser gained 3.3 per cent to $66.46.Hewlett Packard’s share price fell 1 per cent to $24.66 after the printer maker announced broad job cuts as part of its ambitious restructuring plans.In other earnings news, Ford reported a 19 per cent drop in second-quarter profits, but the results were still in line with expectations and the share price responded by rising 0.5 per cent to $10.98.Avon Products, the direct-sale cosmetics company, was the biggest faller on the S&P despite a 41 per cent jump in profits.Sales remained disappointing in China and central and eastern Europe and Avon’s shares slumped 12.3 per cent to $32.10.Archipelago shares continued to slide after Monday’s revelation that US authorities were widening an investigation into the electronic stock exchange’s proposed acquisition by the New York Stock Exchange.The share price slipped 0.2 per cent to $39.90.

The S&P 500 fell 1.80 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 1,189.28. The Nasdaq Composite rose 3.84 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,046.But for the week, the Dow rose 3.3 per cent, the S&P 500 notched a gain of 3.1 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.6 per cent – its best weekly performance since August and the best showing by the Dow and the S&P since November.Positive economic news, a flurry of merger activity, and easing fears about the prospect of a trade war with China calmed investors, who have been battered by several weeks of wild swings on the stock market.Record corporate earnings and an upturn in corporate buying have led many bulls to argue that the recent downward trend on Wall Street is nothing but a “soft patch”, and that valuations remain attractive in spite of the 32 month-old bull market.But bearish voices warn that the market might not yet have seen the bottom of its most recent correction.Strong results from two hardware chains put a spark into trading early in the week after Lowe’s and Home Depot weighed in with higher quarterly profits. Lowe’s rose 8.7 per cent for the week after a gain of 5.6 per cent on Monday. Home Depot, Lowe’s biggest US rival, followed suit on Tuesday with profits up 14 per cent. Its shares rose 9.2 per cent for the week.Morgan Stanley investors brushed off a court decision to award Ronald Perelman, an aggrieved billionaire, $1.5bn in damages. Shares in Morgan Stanley ended the week 3.7 per cent higher.Stocks rallied in late trading on Tuesday after the US Treasury increased the pressure on China to revalue the renminbi. The government stopped short of accusing Beijing of currency manipulation, easing fears that protectionist sentiment in Congress could spark a trade war.Computer makers stole the show on Wednesday after Hewlett-Packard reported higher profits. HP shares rose 9.1 per cent for the week. Gateway, a rival computer maker, jumped 7.7 per cent. Although a new $45m contract to supply computers to the University of Arizona appeared to spark the move, there was some speculation that investors were moving to cover short positions on the stock amid rumours that Bailey Coates, a hedge fund, had liquidated its holdings in the company.A bleak sales outlook from Corning, the biggest maker of glass for use in computer screens and other digital equipment, helped keep gains in check. Shares in the group fell 2.7 per cent for the week after it warned that sales growth could be weaker than first thought.Energy stocks led the way on Thursday as bargain-hunters swooped following the sector’s recent losing streak. ExxonMobil, the biggest US oil producer, edged up 0.6 per cent this week to $54.01 after it agreed to sell some west Texas gas interests to a rival. Valero Energy, the oil and gas explorer, rose 5.4 per cent to $65.19.A flurry of mergers and acquisitions kept traders busy throughout the week.UPS, the express shipper, agreed to buy Overnite Transportation, the trucking concern, for $1.3bn in cash, sending Overnite shares up 43.8 per cent on Monday and 44.2 per cent for the week. UPS shares were up 3.9 per cent on the week by mid-session.Titan, the defence group, rose 7.6 per cent on Thursday and 16 per cent for the week after it agreed to be acquired by L-3 Communications, a rival. L-3 shares rose 7.3 per cent for the week.Late on Thursday, America West, the US regional airline, secured $1.5bn in new financing to merge with US Airways, a bankrupt rival.

55;GLW;Corning Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Corning's long-term rating raised from junk;;Corning, the US glassmaker, sealed its recovery from the telecommunications equipment bust with a return to official investment-grade status in the credit markets.The news that Standard & Poor's had raised the company's long-term rating from junk came a day after the maker of optical fibre, glass for LCD screens and other high-tech glass products reported a 55 per cent jump in earnings in the first quarter. The results, which were well ahead of both Wall Street and Corning projections, drove its shares up by 7.3 per cent on Wednesday to $13.49, a new 12-month high.The reinstatement of Corning's credit status, at the lowest investment-grade rating of BBB-, followed a three-year turnround during which the company shed 21,000 jobs. While telecoms remains Corning's biggest single market, the company's revival has owed more to booming demand for glass for LCD screens.Corning's telecoms business returned to profitability in the first quarter of this year, edging to a $9m profit on sales of $427m. Revenues in the division were up 37 per cent from a year before, thanks to a contract from Verizon, which is building more direct fibre connections to its customers. Corning cautioned, though, that the big sales gains from fibre would end when the Verizon contract reached its one-year anniversary in the second quarter, while it was also experiencing generally lower demand for fibre elsewhere and pricing pressures for the product in China.Meanwhile, sales of LCD glass jumped 39 per cent to $320m, underpinning a 24 per cent rise in overall revenues, to $1.05bn. Earnings also benefited from strong results at Dow Corning, a joint venture that makes silicone products.The rating agency said the upgrade was based on an assumption that Corning would “continue to balance cash demands from growing businesses with cash-generation capabilities, so that negative cashflow will not be a significant issue in 2005 and beyond.”

The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 1,930.43.A government report showing sagging demand for big purchases such as aircraft and appliances fuelled concerns that the economy might be entering a soft patch.However, investors opted to focus more on a 5 per cent decline in crude futures after weekly data showed reserves grew ahead of anticipated rising demand in the summer.The durable-goods data followed downbeat news the previous day that US consumer confidence had reached a five-month low.Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research, said the decline in durable goods orders was mostly due to softness in the auto sector.Mr Yamarone noted that the sharp decline in capital goods outside the defence sector and excluding aircraft was “disconcerting” because the figure is a proxy for future business investment.Amazon’s shares, which have dropped sharply in the past 12 months, fell another 3 per cent to $31.72 by the close. Amazon said tax charges would put a dent in profits this year.Elsewhere, Verizon Communications, the country’s biggest telephone operator, rose 3.6 per cent to $35.22 after strong growth in the company’s wireless unit led to higher profits.Boeing, a Dow component, saw shares add 1.1 per cent to $59.66.This lift came even though the aerospace company reported declining profits and missed revenue forecasts the day its chief rival, Airbus, tested the world’s largest commercial jet.Infospace shares tumbled 27.3 per cent to $35.22 after the technology company issued guidance that disappointed analysts.Among pharmaceutical stocks, Gilead Sciences saw shares give up 6.2 per cent to $36.88 after it said its experimental treatment for Aids would need to be reformulated.Bristol-Myers Squibb, a joint partner in the project, saw shares inch up 0.3 per cent to $25.76.Among oil stocks, Baker-Hughes gave up 2.8 per cent to $43.88 after the oilfield services group reported a 19 per cent increase in quarterly revenues that could not assuage concerns about the sustainability of those gains.On a more upbeat note, WellPoint shares rose 5.4 per cent to $124.45 as the largest health insurer in the US reported rising profits.Shares in Corning rose 8 per cent to $13.57 following reports from the world’s largest maker of fibre-optic cable that quarterly earnings more than quadrupled from the prior year.Best Buy, a retailer of electronics and technology, was up 2.1 per cent to $50.22 after reporting earnings and a stock buyback.
57;GLW;Corning Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;No respite for Wall Street;;Stock index futures pointed to a lower open for Wall Street stocks on Wednesday as mixed quarterly earnings and poor data fanned worries about the outlook for the world’s largest economy.About an hour and a half before the market open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were trading 19 points lower at 10,142, while contracts on the S&P 500 index were 2.10 points lower at 1,151.60, or 0.86 points below fair value. The Nasdaq 100 index contracts were 4.50 points lower at 1,424.50, or 1.35 points below fair value.On the economic news front, durable goods orders fell 2.8 per cent in March for their largest drop since September 2002. Orders of non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, a key gauge of capital expenditure, fell 4.7 per cent.The data were likely to dent the bulls’ hopes for a respite following a broad sell-off in the previous session amid disappointing earnings reports from some prominent US companies.In corporate news, Boeing, a Dow component, saw share give up 1.9 per cent to $57.90 as the aerospace company reported declining profits and missed revenue forecasts the day its chief rival Airbus tested the world’s largest commercial jet and a potential threat to the US group.Shares in Amazon.com fell 6.5 per cent to $30.60 after the largest retailer on the internet reported lower profits due to increased costs.Best Buy, a traditional retailer of electronics and technology, was up 1.6 per cent to $50 after the company reported earnings and announced a stock buyback.Also reporting results was Verizon Communications, whose wireless unit helped it achieve $1.8bn profits in the latest quarter.Infospace shares tumbled 18.7 per cent to $36.58 after the technology company issued a guidance that disappointed analyst estimates.Among pharmaceutical stocks, Gilead Sciences saw shares give up 4.4 per cent to $37.56 after its experimental treatment for AIDS would need to be reformulated. Bristol-Myers Squibb was a joint partner in the project.On a more upbeat note, WellPoint shares rose 2.9 per cent to $121.50 as the largest health insurer in the US reported rising profits.Meanwhile shares in Corning rose 2.8 per cent to $12.91 following reports from the world’s largest maker of fibreoptic cable that quarterly earnings more than quadrupled from the prior year.On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.9 per cent to 10,151.13.

58;GLW;Corning Inc;2005-01-04T08:47:48Z;China removes dumping charges on Corning;;Corning, the US-based diversified technology company, said Beijing had removed anti-dumping charges on its fiber-optic products, reversing a decision made in June last year.In a statement, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MoC) said on Saturday that Corning had not dumped standard single-mode optical fiber into the Chinese market, since the margin between prices in its home country and in China was less than the statutory de minimis threshold.Beijing therefore removed a 16 per cent tariff on Corning’s products, in effect since June 16, 2004.The MoC also ruled that optical fiber imports from the US, South Korea and Japan collectively caused injury to the domestic Chinese optical fiber industry. As a consequence, dumping charges were assigned to companies from these countries, ranging from 7-46 per cent. It did not name specific companies.“They have caused actual damage to relevant industries in China,” the ministry said in an announcement.“And there is a cause and effect relationship between the dumping and that actual damage.””We are very pleased with the MoC’s final determination with regard to Corning. We have a tremendous amount of respect for the MoC and the process they followed to reach their final decision,” said Robert B Brown, senior vice president and general manager of Corning Optical Fiber.Corning relies on China for roughly 6 per cent of its total optical fiber sales. The products are mainly used in the building of telecommunications networks.This particular investigation arose when two Chinese optical fiber producers - Wuhan’s Yangtze Optical Fiber Cable and Jiangsu Fasten Photonics - accused Corning and others of undercutting the market. A senior manager at the Wuhan company was quoted in Chinese media as saying this latest decision came unexpectedly and thay they would respond accordingly.China, which is frequently accused by other countries for exporting products at prices below fair market prices, has initiated similar investigations against foreign companies in recent years. Between 1997 and the end of 2004, Beijing launched 34 anti-dumping investigations.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
