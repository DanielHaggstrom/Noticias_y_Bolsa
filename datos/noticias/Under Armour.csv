0;UAA;Under Armour;2019-11-04T14:31:13Z;Under Armour knocked by accounting probe and outlook cut;Shares fall 15% in early trade despite better than expected quarterly results;Under Armour shares fell sharply on Monday after the athletic wear maker said federal regulators were probing its accounting practices and lowered its full-year outlook.Shares in the Baltimore-based company were down more than 15 per cent to $17.95 shortly after the open after it confirmed that since July 2017 it has been responding to requests for documents and information from both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice relating to its “accounting practices and related disclosures”.Under Armour said it “continues to believe its accounting practices and related disclosures were appropriate”. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday, which noted the probe was focused on whether the company inflated its sales figures.The investigation creates “another dark cloud” for Under Armour, said Rick Patel, an analyst at Needham. The sportswear company’s shareholders are currently contending with a leadership change at the group. Chief executive Kevin Plank, who founded Under Armour in his grandmother’s basement, last month announced he would relinquish his title as chief executive and assume the role of executive chairman and brand chief, tasking chief operating officer Patrik Frisk with turning round the company when he takes the helm.The news also comes during a tough time for Under Armour, which has seen growth moderate after years of rapid expansion as it has faced stiff competition from the likes of Nike and Adidas. Last year, the company acknowledged it had lost focus and would return to its roots as a sportswear company, breaking away from the “athleisure” trend that has helped fuel growth in workout wear makers in recent years.The company now expects 2019 revenue to increase 2 per cent year-on-year, down from its previous outlook for sales growth in the range of 3 to 4 per cent, amid “ongoing traffic and conversion challenges in direct-to-consumer” and negative impacts from foreign currency translation. However, Under Armour expects operating income to come in at the higher of its prior guidance of $230m to $235m and boosted its gross margin outlook.The accounting probe and downbeat revenue guidance overshadowed better than expected quarterly results. Revenues fell 1 per cent from a year ago to $1.43bn, slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations, according to a Refinitiv survey.In North America, the company’s largest market, revenues fell 4.1 per cent, in line with forecasts, while overseas revenues grew 5 per cent. Meanwhile, revenues from clothing climbed 1 per cent but footwear sales fell 12 per cent.Net income climbed to $102.3m, or 23 cents a share, in the three months ended in September. That was up from $72.3m, or 17 cents a share, in the year ago quarter, eclipsing analyst expectations for 18 cents.Under Armour shares had been up 20 per cent year-to-date as of Friday’s close.
1;UAA;Under Armour;2019-10-22T20:31:59Z;Under Armour: walking the Plank;Shares rise nearly 4% as founder moves from CEO role ;You could call it a splinter movement. Kevin Plank is relinquishing his chief executive title at Under Armour, the apparel company he started in his grandmother’s basement 23-years ago and built into one of the world’s biggest sportswear brands.The change is overdue. Under Armour shares have plummeted more than 60 per cent from their 2015 highs as it struggles to revive sales in its core North America market. These accounted for nearly three-quarters of group revenue last year.It also comes amid complaints about the company’s workplace culture - including alleged strip club visits and other bad behaviour by executives.Investors cheered the leadership change by pushing up Under Armour shares nearly 4 per cent. Celebration may be premature. For one thing, Mr Plank is not leaving the $8.8bn company. He will become executive chairman and brand chief. Patrik Frisk, the new CEO, will still report directly to him. Mr Plank will also continue to maintain his tight grip over Under Armour through his super-voting shares. Despite owning an economic stake of only around 15 per cent, Mr Plank controls 65 per cent of the vote, according to Under Amour’s latest proxy filing.The cult of the super-charged founder is propped up by a soaring share price. It is a different story when the stock starts falling. Investors did well in the first decade after Under Armour went public in 2005, with the stock surging more than four-fold. Since 2017 it has remained stuck at around $20. In contrast, rival Nike shares have nearly doubled since, hitting a record high on Monday.Under Armour’s turnaround efforts have lacked traction. Topline growth remains ho-hum. Operating margins of between 3 to 4 per cent are well below the mid teens recorded at Nike. Under Armour shares are trading at a premium to Nike. They are pricing in a recovery. It is up to Mr Frisk to deliver on that promise - without starting a cult of personality of his own.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
2;UAA;Under Armour;2019-10-22T15:52:31Z;Under Armour founder Kevin Plank to step aside as CEO;Sportswear billionaire will hand reins to Patrik Frisk and stay on as executive chairman;Kevin Plank, the billionaire who founded Under Armour in his grandmother’s basement and went on to build a rival to Nike and Adidas, is standing aside as the sportswear brand’s chief executive after 23 years.In an unexpected move, Under Armour said he would be replaced at the start of next year by chief operating officer Patrik Frisk, who will take on the challenge of turning round the S&P 500 company after a period of disappointing results.Mr Plank, who owns a 15 per cent stake in the group, will stay on as executive chairman and brand chief. The 47-year-old former American football player launched Under Armour in 1996 as he was dissatisfied with the quality of on-field clothing.The Baltimore-based company went on to become one of the world’s biggest sports brands, employing about 15,000 people and generating $5.2bn in revenues last year.But the group has experienced a rough patch as growth moderated after a period of rapid expansion. It notched up a net loss of $17m in the second quarter. A particular weak spot has been its North America business, where quarterly revenues dipped 3 per cent.The company’s culture has also been in the spotlight after a report last year that employees claimed strip club visits on expenses.The leadership change is the highest profile yet in a series of management shifts. Under Armour last month hired Stephanie Pugliese from workwear company Duluth Trading to lead its North America division, replacing Jason LaRose, who left in May.At the end of last year Mr Plank said Under Armour had lost “focus” and pledged to switch its attention back to clothing for athletes, a move considered to be a break from its ventures into fashion-driven “athleisure wear”.Shares in Under Armour, which traded above $50 four years ago, added 3.8 per cent to hit $20.86 on Tuesday morning in New York.“Patrik is the right person to serve as Under Armour’s next CEO,” Mr Plank said in a statement.Paul Lejuez, an analyst at Citigroup, said he expected the incoming chief executive to take charge “of the day-to-day” while Mr Plank would remain “the face of the brand”.He added that the promotion of Mr Frisk, 56, was reassuring. “If there was anything going wrong with the long-term strategy, it would not make sense for him to step into the CEO role now,” the analyst said.Formerly chief executive of Aldo Group under Aldo Bensadoun, the shoe retailer’s founder, Mr Frisk joined Under Armour in 2017 and has focused on improving its performance in North America.“The opportunity that lies ahead of us is incredible,” he said in the statement on Tuesday. “I am honoured to lead this great brand toward the realisation of its full potential.”
3;UAA;Under Armour;2019-07-30T16:16:44Z;Under Armour shares face biggest drop since 2017 as North America sales falter;;Under Armour forecast a weaker outlook for its North American business, taking the gloss off second-quarter earnings that topped market expectations and putting the sportswear maker’s shares on track for their biggest one-day drop since 2017.The Baltimore-based company clung to a forecast for group revenue in 2019 to increase between 3 per cent and 4 per cent from a year ago, but said it now expected a “slight decline” in sales from North America, compared to its prediction three months ago for “relatively flat results” from the region.Under Armour’s struggles with its primary market come at a time when direct rivals such as Nike and Adidas continue to chalk up year-on-year increases in revenues from North America, and prompted some analysts to wonder whether the company was making enough traction with its turnround plan announced at the end of 2018.Patrik Frisk, chief operating officer, said in a conference call on Tuesday the company’s strategy in recent months for its wholesale channel to reduce discounting of stock was a “positive brand move” but still a “negative impact” to revenue growth in North America.For sales made directly to North American consumers, Mr Frisk said “we are experiencing softer than anticipated demand as we work to reset the business towards full price selling”.Solid rates of year-on-year revenue growth for Under Armour’s international business are helping offset the weakness in its main market, although these overseas revenues are more susceptible to currency fluctuations and the impact of a strong US dollar.In the three months ended June 30, Under Armour’s total revenue was up 1 per cent from a year ago to $1.19bn and only $7m below the median forecast among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. North America revenues were down 3 per cent at $816m compared to a year earlier, offset by a 12 per cent growth rate for its international business to $339m.The company’s adjusted net loss of 4 cents a share, including a one penny impact from the group’s stake in its Japanese licensee, was narrower than the 5 cents a share loss Wall Street forecast.Under Armour said revenues in the current quarter would be down between 2 per cent and 3 per cent owing to lower sales from discounted products and “tempered expectations” for its direct to consumer business, although fourth-quarter revenues were tipped to bounce back at a low- to mid-teen percentage rate.For fiscal 2019, the company still expects to report earnings of 33 cents to 34 cents, unchanged from three months ago and one penny shy of market forecasts.Paul Lejuez, retail analyst at Citi, said in a note that while Under Armour’s second-quarter results were unlikely to be an indication its turnround plan was at risk, “there were also no signs that they are moving the ball forward ahead of the plan, which will likely pressure the stock today (given how well it has performed)”.Under Armour’s shares were down 12.1 per cent at a two-month low of $24.11, and leaving them up 37.2 per cent for 2019. The stock was on track for its biggest one-day drop since October 2017 and fell as much as 19.6 per cent earlier today.The company’s struggles with North America are in contrast to its rivals. Adjusted for currency fluctuations, Nike’s North American revenues in the three months ended May 31 were up 7 per cent from a year ago, while Adidas saw its sales from the region rise 3.3 per cent in its most recent reported quarter to the end of March.And although not exclusively a maker of sportswear, Ralph Lauren earlier today said revenue from North America rose 3 per cent year-on-year in its first quarter of fiscal 2020, or by 1 per cent at stores that had been open for more than 12 months. Its shares were down 1.9 per cent, although its adjusted earnings also beat Wall Street estimates.
4;UAA;Under Armour;2019-05-02T15:46:31Z;Under Armour results beat forecasts but North America sales sag;Athletics-wear maker boosts outlook as turnround continues;Under Armour investors cheered progress in its turnround efforts as its first-quarter results topped estimates and the company boosted its outlook. However, sales continued to slip in its crucial domestic market.Revenue rose 2 per cent from a year ago to $1.2bn in the three months ended in March, just ahead of analysts’ expectations for $1.18bn.Under Armour shares rose 4 per cent to $22.97 and were eyeing their best one-day showing since February.However, the report showed revenues in North America fell 3 per cent to $843m — where the company has consciously been cutting back on promotions. That contrasted with rival Nike, which posted a 7 per cent jump in sales in the market despite a slower pace of growth.Despite the slowdown at home, Under Armour reported a 12 per cent increase in international sales to $328m.The company also swung to a profit of $22.5m, or 5 cents a share, from a loss of $30.2m, or 7 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. That also topped analysts’ estimates for the company to break even on a per-share basis.Gross margin rose 100 basis points to 45.2 per cent compared with the previous year, driven by higher prices. And inventory fell 24 per cent to $875m, the company said.“Under Armour delivered a high-quality [first quarter] beat and FY19 EPS guidance raise,” analysts at UBS noted. “This likely clears the market’s bar since few expected this given the tough US macro environment in Q1. It also suggests Under Armour’s turnround is on track and slightly ahead of schedule.”Indeed, looking ahead the company raised its full-year earnings outlook to a range of between 33 cents to 34 cents a share, up from between 31 cents to 33 cents previously.The company, which grew rapidly from its beginnings in founder Kevin Plank’s grandmother’s basement in 1996 to take on bigger rivals like Nike and Adidas, had in recent years jumped on the so-called “athleisure” trend. Under Armour even pushed into sports-inspired fashion, through a tie-up with designer Tim Coppens. But at the end of last year Mr Plank said the company had lost its “focus” and pledged to shift its attention back to clothing for athletes, in a move considered to be a break from athleisure.Under Armour shares are up 30 per cent year-to-date, having advanced 22 per cent last year.
5;UAA;Under Armour;2019-02-12T12:52:26Z;Fewer discounts help Under Armour top expectations in holiday quarter;;Under Armour on Tuesday posted upbeat quarterly results and improved its gross margin by lowering discounting and product sourcing costs in the holiday quarter as the company refocuses on clothing for athletes.The Baltimore-based company said overall revenues climbed 1.5 per cent from a year ago to $1.39bn, just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $1.38bn, according to a survey of analysts by Refinitiv.Revenues in North America fell 6 per cent to $965m, while overseas revenue jumped 24 per cent to $395m — up sharply in Asia, and Europe, Middle East and Africa but weaker in Latin America. By product category the company said apparel revenues rose 2 per cent, while footwear and accessories fell 4.5 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively.Under Armour swung to a profit, reporting net income to $4.2m or 1 cent a share in the three months ended in December, compared with a loss of $87.9m or 20 cents a share in the year ago quarter, which included the impact of restructuring charges and the US tax overhaul.Adjusting for one-time items the company reported earnings of 9 cents a share, topping analysts’ estimates for 4 cents.Gross margin improved by 160 basis points from a year ago to 45 per cent “driven predominantly by regional and channel mix, product cost improvements, lower promotional activity, and lower air freight partially offset by changes in foreign currency”. Meanwhile, inventories decreased 12 per cent.The company, which grew rapidly from its beginnings in founder Kevin Plank’s grandmother’s basement in 1996 to take on bigger rivals like Nike and Adidas, had in recent years jumped on the “athleisure” trend — a name given to those who wear athletic gear even when they are not working out. Under Armour even pushed into sports-inspired fashion, through a tie-up with designer Tim Coppens.But at the end of last year Mr Plank said the company had lost its “focus” and pledged to shift its attention back to clothing for athletes in a move considered to be a break from athleisure.The change in strategy came after Under Armour delivered an underwhelming longer term forecast at its investor day in December, where it said it expects compound annual revenue growth in the low single digits in North America between 2020 and 2022.The sportswear maker has cut jobs and last year announced a major restructuring that included overhauling its business to respond better to shifting consumer tastes and build up its online strategy.Under Armour continues to expect revenue to increase between 3 to 4 per cent in the 2019 fiscal year, including “relatively flat” results for North America and low double-digit growth for its overseas business.Shares in the sportswear company, which were up 17.6 per cent year-to-date as of Monday’s close, traded choppily in pre-market trade, rising 5 per cent before reversing those gains to trade 0.5 per cent lower.
6;UAA;Under Armour;2018-12-26T15:50:33Z;Under Armour breaks from ‘athleisure’ craze;Sportswear group is returning to its roots after losing focus, says chief executive;Under Armour is returning to its roots as a sportswear company, breaking from the “athleisure” craze in which people who do no exercise wear workout kit.Kevin Plank, founder and chief executive, said the S&P 500 company had lost its “focus” and pledged to train its attention on clothing for athletes.While Mr Plank said Under Armour would remain committed to style, he made clear the brand was more at home in the gym than on the catwalk.“If they [consumers] want to go sit on the couch they can, but that product was built to help them get through a 10-mile run,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. “We don’t dissuade them from doing it — we just need to know who we are.”He added: “We are a performance brand. That is what we’re going to be and going to stand for, becoming the best in the world at that.”The refocus on sport comes at a critical time for the Baltimore-based company. Earlier this month it issued an underwhelming financial forecast at an investor day, while its culture has also been in the spotlight after a report that employees put strip club visits on expenses.Under Armour, started by Mr Plank in his grandmother’s basement in 1996, wowed Wall Street as it expanded aggressively and took on the likes of Nike and Adidas. But its shares have fallen 68 per cent from 2015 highs while sales have flagged in North America.“We grew so quickly that we lost focus,” said Mr Plank. “We got wide.”Under Armour is one of many companies that has sought to capitalise on rising demand for athletic-themed clothing. Workplaces have become more casual and consumers want more comfortable alternatives to jeans and suits.Global athleisure sales are growing between 2 per cent and 4 per cent annually, according to consultancy AT Kearney, outpacing a stagnant overall clothing market.“Sports apparel brands have benefited from consumers who want to be associated with sports and the lifestyle, without necessarily doing the hard work,” said Marie Driscoll, managing director of luxury and fashion at Coresight Research.The market is highly competitive, however. Traditional sporting goods groups from Fila to The North Face vie with fashion-oriented brands such as Lululemon and Sweaty Betty. Celebrities including Khloé Kardashian and Beyoncé have also launched their own lines.Several brands have been adopted by consumers for styles unintended by the companies. Under Armour’s often-dark clothing was a favourite in the “health goth” aesthetic, for instance.The company’s own ventures into sports-inspired fashion included a tie-up two years ago with designer Tim Coppens, known as Under Armour Sportswear. It has since been discontinued.Last year Mr Plank said he wanted the company to have a position “at the high end of fashion”, adding that the “sport lifestyle” market was its “largest opportunity”.However, some analysts said the brand had struggled to position itself in athleisure. “When they entered in 2016 they were already too late,” said Adheer Bahulkar, partner at AT Kearney. “It never really worked.”He added: “The question is, are you giving up a much bigger market in athleisure to go after a smaller market in products for the true athlete? But if you realise that you are already losing the athleisure game, then you want at least to reclaim the athlete market.”Mr Plank said the company had a “big opportunity” in the “focused performer” market for consumers who exercise regularly. The sector, he said, generated $92bn in global annual retail revenue.He also said the company was eyeing a target to increase the number of women in senior leadership positions as part of a “meaningful cultural transformation”.
7;UAA;Under Armour;2018-12-12T20:38:32Z;Under Armour under pressure after outlook disappoints;;Under Armour shares tumbled on Wednesday after the athletic wear company issued an underwhelming longer term forecast at its investor day.Shares in the Baltimore-based company fell more than 11 per cent to $19.65. If the stock were to hold on to its losses it would be on track for its worst day since October 2017.The slide came after the company said it expects compound annual revenue growth in the low single digits in North America between 2020 and 2022.In Europe, Middle East and Africa (Emea) the company sees growth in the mid-teens over the same period and in the high single digits in 2023. In Asia-Pacific, the company expects revenue growth in the mid-20s on a CAGR basis and in Latin America, Under Armour projects low double digit growth between 2020 and 2022.The outlook appeared to underwhelm investors. “It is important to consider Under Armour the brand and Under Armour the stock,” said Simeon Siegel, analyst at Nomura Instinet.“At its valuation, the long term targets likely feel short of lofty investor expectations. Which means at this point, investors must decide if the targets are conservative or realistic.”The sportswear maker has been cutting jobs and last year announced a major restructuring that included overhauling its business to better respond to shifting consumer tastes and build up its online strategy.Looking to the near term, the company forecast revenues to rise between 3 to 4 per cent in 2019 and predicted earnings of between 31 to 33 cents a share, shy of analysts’ estimates of 35 cents, according to a Refinitv poll.Under Armour shares had been up more than 50 per cent year-to-date as of Tuesday’s close.
8;UAA;Under Armour;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
9;UAA;Under Armour;2018-10-30T15:01:29Z;Under Armour eyes best day since Jan 2016 on overseas boost, rosy outlook;Gross margin improves as company’s turnround takes hold;Under Armour shares were on track for their best day in more than 2 years on Tuesday after the athletic-wear maker reported upbeat quarterly results on the back of strong overseas sales and gross margin, and boosted its full-year outlook.The Baltimore based company, which is in the midst of a turnround, said revenues in the third quarter rose 2 per cent from a year ago to $1.44bn, just ahead of analysts’ estimates for $1.42bn, according to a survey by Refinitiv.That reflected a 15 per cent jump in its international sales to $351m, compared to a 2 per cent decrease in North America to $1.1bn.Net income rose to $75.3m or 17 cents a share in the three months ended in September, compared with $54.2m or 12 cents a share in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 25 cents a share eclipsed analysts estimates’ for 12 cents.Gross margin climbed 10 basis points to 46.1 per cent of sales compared to the previous year, after including $5m of restructuring efforts. Adjusted gross margin rose 20 basis points to 46.5 per cent.That propelled Under Armour shares as much as 25 per cent, before they trimmed those gains to trade 21 per cent higher at $22.07 — on track for their best day since January 2016. The rally took the company’s year-to-date advance to nearly 54 per cent.“Under Armour continues to make progress on its multiyear restructuring, particularly with regards to inventory and cost reduction efforts. While some challenges still remain, the company is stabilising and is better positioned for improvement in 2019,” said Moody’s analyst Mike Zuccaro.Under Armour has been among the beneficiaries of the athleisure trend, helped by its partnership with NBA star Steph Curry. However, competition from rivals like Adidas hurt the retailer and sales began to stall last year.Chief executive and founder Kevin Plank, on the company’s earning call on Tuesday, described the past two years as having “served as one of the most challenging yet productive and opportunistic times in our history.”To combat these challenges, Under Armour last year unveiled a major restructuring, cutting jobs, shortening the time taken to get products to customers and slashing costs by shutting underperforming stores and exiting certain sports marketing contracts.Looking ahead, the company said it now expects full-year revenues to rise 3-4 per cent — reflecting a low single-digit decline in North America and 25 per cent growth overseas. The adjusted earnings outlook was revised higher to between 19-22 cents a share, up from 16-19 cents a share previously.
10;UAA;Under Armour;2018-10-15T03:00:26Z;Not every company is a technology company;Solid, long-established corporate names are confusing customers with sector-fluidity;Rather than adopting the hackneyed advice to think outside the box, companies often take a different tack: they relabel the box.The most common way of doing this used to be to declare that what was a carmaker, insurance company, or bank was now a technology company.Under Armour, which makes sportswear, Jaguar Land Rover, which makes vehicles, and financial institutions such as Capital One, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have made such statements in recent years. “Anybody that’s going to live in the future better be [here],” said Under Armour’s chief executive Kevin Plank when asked to explain his presence at the tech-heavy Consumer Electronics Show in 2016.JPMorgan took this ambition a step further last week when it said it was giving new investment bankers and asset managers coding lessons, in the hope they would learn to “speak the same language as our technology teams, which ultimately drives better tools and solutions for our clients”.Whether teaching coding will achieve such goals is a subject for another column. But whether JPMorgan and Under Armour are technology companies is an easy question to answer. They are not.Or rather, if they are, then only in the sense that all companies must understand and invest in technology.If anything, the ubiquity of tech is rendering old categories meaningless.Very occasionally, a company is genuinely misunderstood, often for deep historical reasons. Until it sold its sugar and syrup business in 2010, Tate & Lyle struggled to convince analysts that it was in fact a high-tech ingredients producer. One former chief executive went so far as to sport a suit made from corn-based fabric, to show off the group’s science-based strategy.There are also a few practical reasons for companies to emphasise their tech strengths. As dependency on advanced technology increases, everyone competes for the same developers and programmers. Traditional companies are bound to search for a little more clout in the jobs market against obvious tech heavy-hitters such as Google or Facebook.Mostly, though, the reasons for dressing in technology’s clothes are less edifying. Some companies simply calculate the sector’s stock market glamour will rub off on their own securities. As the recent volatility of US technology stocks has shown, this is far from a one-way bet.At its extreme, the hunt for a hot sector can lead to such shape-shifting absurdities as the renaming of humdrum manufacturers as go-go dotcoms in the 1990s or the more recent pivot of tea brewers, biotech companies, sports bra makers and others into pioneers of blockchain.In the early 2000s, some companies fighting against growing opposition to stock option perks lobbied to be reassigned to the technology sector, in the hope their lavish grants of options would look less outlandish when compared with Silicon Valley. According to an insider, one traditional industrial company even argued it was a technology company because it had a website.This sort of quest often ends in retreat, restructuring and regret.A more solid strategic approach is to buy into the sector — witness legacy banks’ takeovers of fintech stars. But a company that merely tries to pass itself off as something it is not risks annoying, or worse, confusing, its front-line staff and customers. Common sense says most users of banks, carmakers and athletic wear want to save or borrow money, to buy a reliable car, or to find some comfortable leggings. If they start to worry about how the technology works, it has either gone wrong ( banks, please note), or is somehow obscuring the core product.The trend towards sector fluidity is unlikely to slow down. Even the boxes into which companies were once placed are being shuffled. S&P Dow Jones Indices has just moved multiple stocks, including Google’s parent Alphabet and Facebook, out of the “information technology” sector and into “communication services”.“We started thinking how different companies use Facebook and the answer was: ‘They communicate through it’,” explains David Blitzer, who heads the S&P DJI index committee.This matters most for investors’ industry-weighted portfolios. But the sector is so broad — it embraces telecoms groups such as AT&T, advertising agencies and computer game makers — that it allows for even more change in years to come.These days, we talk to the technology hidden in our phones, our cars, our banks, our shops and our household appliances. They talk back.Pretending to be a technology company is so yesterday.

11;UAA;Under Armour;2018-09-20T15:34:40Z;Under Armour sprints higher on further cost cutting;;Shares in Under Armour are getting pumped on Thursday after the sportswear maker issued an update on its restructuring plan and lifted the bottom end of its full year adjusted earnings guidance.The stock jumped as much as 6.5 per cent to $19.97 as investors appeared to cheer news that Under Armour is cutting another 400 jobs, or about 3 per cent of its workforce, as part of its ongoing bid to slash costs.The Maryland-based company had already cut 277 jobs last year as part of a major restructuring announced last August.It said on Thursday that the latest round of job cuts will result in about $10m in additional severance charges. This means it now expects total pre-tax restructuring charges for this year to be between $200m-$220m, compared to its prior guidance of $190m-$210m. Operating loss will come in at around $60m, the top end of its earlier forecast.“In our relentless pursuit of running a more operationally excellent company, we continue to make difficult decisions to ensure we are best positioned to succeed,” said chief financial officer David Bergman.The market also took heart from Under Armour’s updated earnings guidance. Stripping out one-off restructuring costs, full year adjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected to be between $0.16 to $0.19, up from the previous $0.14 to $0.19 range it guided.“We believe the benefits of a leaner organisation extend well-beyond immediate cost savings,” said analysts at Jefferies. “Looking ahead, we believe the optimised workforce will enable faster decision-making across key functional groups in the supply chain, which should ultimately support strategic initiatives like scaling footwear and international.”Under Armour, which rose to prominence on the back of its sneakers partnership with NBA superstar Stephen Curry, struggled throughout 2017 as the so-called athleisure trend in which sportswear is worn outside of the gym, diminished.This shift in consumer shopping habits has come amid an ever-growing number of entrants into the market, with general retailers like Gap and Old Navy making an aggressive push into atlethicwear with their own lines of high tech joggers and sportsbras.The stock lost 50 per cent in 2017, but is up 38 per cent this year as the cost cutting drive started to yield fruits.
12;UAA;Under Armour;2018-08-29T13:23:58Z;Dick’s Sporting Goods shares drops on weak gun sales;Bad day for US retail as American Eagle lingerie sales also prove disappointing;Dick’s Sporting Goods, the US retailer, blamed disappointing sales of firearms and the athletic apparel brand Under Armour for a weak set of quarterly results.The company’s earnings came on the same day that clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters released a disappointing forecast for profits for the current quarter, taking the shine off what has been a relatively buoyant earnings season for the US retail sector.Guns sales were a particular drag at Dick’s. The company said earlier this year that it was pulling assault-style rifles from its shelves and limiting firearm sales to people over the age of 21 in the wake of a mass shooting at a Florida high school.Dick’s also plans this quarter to remove “virtually all” hunting products from more stores.“As the hunt industry continues to face headwinds we’re evaluating our strategy for this category across all banners,” chief executive Edward Stack said on an earnings call on Wednesday, noting that the firearm sector, as a whole, was “challenged”. He added: “This includes optimising that assortment and reallocating the floor space to categories that drive profitable sales growth.”Overall, Dick’s same-store sales were down 4 per cent in the second quarter, sending its shares down as much as 10 per cent in early trading. Analysts had only expected a same-store sales drop of 0.6 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Overall, the retailer notched net sales of $2.18bn, which also failed to meet analyst expectations of $2.24bn.Dick’s suffered “continued significant declines” in sales of the Under Armour brand, which recently started distributing more of its products at discount retailers. “Our Under Armour business has been difficult,” said Mr Stack. “We’re in the process of replacing that business and also looking at how we can grow the Under Armour business going forward.”Under Armour’s own shares were also hit by the news, falling nearly 8 per cent at one point before recovering some of the ground.Dick’s earnings per share were up on a year-on-year basis, rising to $1.20 per share versus $1.03 in the same period last year. Analysts expected earnings of $1.05 for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Additionally, Dick’s raised its full-year earnings guidance to a range of $3.02 to $3.20, up from $2.92 to $3.12.American Eagle was down more than 10 per cent at their worst on Wednesday after investors reacted poorly to third-quarter earnings guidance of 45 to 47 cents per share, lower than the 49 cents the market had previously been expecting.Sales of its Aerie lingerie line — which has proved popular with millennials and won market share from older brands such as Victoria’s Secret — were lower than expected in the second quarter, too.
13;UAA;Under Armour;2018-07-26T11:38:34Z;Under Armour shares pumped on upbeat revenue, improved outlook;;Under Armour shares jogged higher in early trade on Thursday as investors were emboldened by the athletic wear maker’s upbeat quarterly revenues and an upward revision to its full-year sales outlook.The Baltimore-based company said its second-quarter revenues rose 8 per cent to $1.2bn, just ahead of analyst expectations for $1.15bn, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.A breakdown showed that Under Armour’s investment in overseas markets, as it faces stiffer competition in North America, was paying off. Sales in Asia-Pacific rose 34.3 per cent, in Europe, Middle East and Africa, they climbed 30.8 per cent. In North America, sales turned positive, rising 1.6 per cent*.The company’s net loss however widened to $95.5m or 21 cents a share, compared to a loss of $12.3m or 3 cents a share in the year ago period. Adjusting for one time-items, a loss of 8 cents a share was in line with analyst estimates.Under Armour was among the beneficiaries of the athleisure trend used to describe a preference for wearing more casual clothes like workout gear outside of the gym. The company had focused on its so-called sports lifestyle unit which its chief executive Kevin Plank previously calling the company’s largest opportunity.However competition from rivals like Adidas, has hurt Under Armour’s growth. The company has also been looking to reduce elevated inventory levels having struggled with delays in getting its product to wholesalers.“Through the first half of 2018, we are making progress toward our transformation of running a more operationally excellent company while amplifying the power of the Under Armour brand,” Mr Plank said. “The ongoing improvements in our structure, systems and go-to-market process across our global business better position us to drive a more consistent, predictable path to deliver for our consumers, customers and shareholders over the long-term.”Looking ahead, the company now expects net revenue to rise between 3 to 4 per cent in fiscal 2018 from a year ago, up from its previous outlook for a low single-digit percentage rate. That reflected a slightly less gloomy outlook for North America where it now expects a low-to-mid single-digit sales decline, compared with its previous outlook for a mid-single digit drop. Under Armour maintained its outlook for adjusted earnings of between 14 to 19 cents a share.The company unveiled a restructuring plan in February and said it now expects to incur charges of between $190m to $210m in 2018.Under Armour shares, which were up 46 per cent year-to-date at Wednesday’s close, were up 5 per cent in pre-market trade.*This post has been amended to correct the rate of sales growth in North America.
14;UAA;Under Armour;2018-06-04T22:05:31Z;Under Armour bounces after analyst ups price target;;Investors bid up Under Armour shares on Monday after Stifel lifted its price target for the stock and issued an upbeat report on the loss-making company’s efforts to return to profitability.Shares in the Baltimore-based sportswear apparel maker jumped 6.32 per cent to settle at $22.71 per share, marking its best one-day performance since May16.Citing recent talks with company officials, Stifel said Under Armour has been undertaking efforts aimed at improving its finances through cuts in sponsorship commitments and better inventory management, among others.“Since this time, the narrative of leadership has emphasized focus on operating efficiency, rationalization of expenses, prioritization of resources, and commitment to earnings,” Stifel’s Jim Duffy wrote in a note. “While the influence may not yet be evident in reported numbers, evidence is building that leadership is walking the walk.”As a result, Stifel is raising its target price for the company to $27 from $20.“Projecting the profitability focus forward to future years gives us a more optimistic view of earnings power and therefore upside potential for shares,” Mr Duffy said.Prior to Stifel’s note, Under Armour’s shares have climbed by around 50 per cent this year amid improving sales and despite two consecutive quarters of losses partly due to restructuring costs.The company booked a net loss of $30m in the first quarter on the back of $37m restructuring and impairment charges. Revenues, meanwhile, were up 6 per cent to $1.2bn, helped by international sales, the company reported on May 1.For full-year 2018, the company expects “low single-digit” revenue growth and $0.14-0.19 adjusted diluted earnings per share.
15;UAA;Under Armour;2018-05-01T12:12:44Z;Under Armour stems North America sales decline;;Sportswear group Under Armour stemmed the sales decline in its largest market of North America and increased revenue overseas by around a fifth, helping it beat analysts’ expectations for its first-quarter results.Under Armour has been struggling to counter lacklustre sales in its domestic market, which accounts for around three quarters of its total revenue. In the three months to March, revenues in the region fell 0.4 per cent from a year earlier to $868m. That drop was a marked improvement from the fourth quarter of 2017, when North American sales fell 4.5 per cent year-on-year.In contrast, international sales climbed 27 per cent overall, or 19 per cent when currency effects were stripped out, driven by Asia-Pacific revenues.Still, gross margin slipped by 120 basis points, to 44.2 per cent, as “benefits from changes in foreign currency rates were more than offset by accelerated inventory management initiatives”.The Baltimore-based company reported another quarterly loss of $30m — up from a $2m loss in the same quarter last year — weighed down by restructuring charges unveiled at its full-year results in February. Excluding the impact of those plans, adjusted net income was $1m, in line with the previous quarter.Chief executive Kevin Plank said the results “[demonstrated] measured progress against our focus on operational excellence and becoming a better company”. Reiterating the company’s full-year targets, he added:As we continue to build our global brand by delivering innovative performance products to our athletes, amplifying our story, further strengthening our go-to-market process, and leveraging our systems to create even deeper consumer connections — we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year targets.Shares in Under Armour climbed around 4 per cent in pre-market trading before trimming their gains to stand up 0.6 per cent at $17.76 shortly before publication time.
16;UAA;Under Armour;2018-03-29T20:50:30Z;Under Armour discloses data breach affecting 150m user accounts;;Clothing brand Under Armour is under pressure after it said that a data security breach had affected about 150m user accounts for its MyFitnessPal fitness and diet tracking service. The company’s shares fell about 4 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday after disclosing the issue. The company — best known for its athletic apparel — said it learnt on March 25 that an unauthorised party had gotten data associated with MyFitnessPal user accounts, including usernames, email addresses and scrambled passwords, in late February. Payment card information was not affected, the company said. It estimated that about 150m user accounts were affected. Under Armour bought MyFitnessPal — an app and website that helps users track fitness and nutrition — for $475m in 2015.*﻿This post has been updated to clarify that the passwords accessed were scrambled.
17;UAA;Under Armour;2018-02-27T12:04:27Z;US Olympians leverage Instagram star power to promote sponsors;Athletes project brands to global audience through lucrative social media deals;The Winter Olympics has transformed the social media profiles of several star athletes, highlighting the growing commercial appeal of Instagram-savvy participants as brand ambassadors.Projecting both themselves and their sponsors to a global audience, US Olympians have gained more than 3.6m followers on Instagram, Facebook’s photo-sharing site, since the beginning of the games, providing even better engagement rates for some marketers than those seen during the National Football League’s Super Bowl.Luckily for the losers, social media success — a critical metric for sponsors ranging from Visa to Mountain Dew — is not limited to the best Olympic performers either. An FT analysis showed the popularity of athletes’ profiles was only loosely correlated to performance in the medal tables.Shaun White and Chloe Kim, snowboarders who both won gold medals in the halfpipe, gained more followers than any other athletes, providing a boost for Burton Snowboards, which sponsors both of them. Each picked up more than 500,000 new Instagram followers, taking White to 1.2m and Kim to nearly 750,000.Engagement for Burton, which has fewer followers than White at 1.1m, increased 83 per cent the day after his gold medal win, according to 4C, a marketing technology company that measures TV and social media — metrics are based on active engagement such as mentions, retweets, comments and likes. Engagement for Toyota, another of Kim’s sponsors, increased 574 per cent the day after her gold medal, 4C found. This number outstrips the boost brands like Under Armour — which sponsors basketball player Steph Curry and football quarterback Tom Brady — recorded after the NBA finals (50 per cent) and the Super Bowl (264 per cent), traditional highlights of US marketers’ year. Marketing agencies told the FT these increases in the number of followers and social engagement will translate into dollars. Wasserman, which represents Hilary Knight, the US women’s hockey forward and three-times Olympic medallist, estimated that the value of her social engagements doubled after winning Olympic gold, from $39,000 to $87,000. Knight, who is sponsored by Visa and Xfinity, gained more than 20,000 followers on Instagram alone. “Social media has become integral to activating athlete sponsorships, and if a company is not thinking about how to leverage an athlete’s social media influence, they’re simply missing out,” said Dedra DeLilli, a group manager for Toyota Olympic/Paralympic marketing over email. “When a brand successfully drives home an association with an athlete that’s creating significant games-time chatter, brand reach is almost limitless.”Kim — with more than 700,000 Instagram followers and 300,000 Twitter followers — is among those who have proven their ability to drive engagement for brands. She gained nearly 100,000 followers in the lead up to the halfpipe finals, her only Olympic event, and her profile continued to skyrocket as she tweeted about breakfast sandwiches and being “hangry” between runs before winning Olympic gold. Unlike many athletes who choose to sign contracts spanning the years between Olympics Games, Kim’s deals will, by choice, be up when she turns 18 years old this spring. Adam Rippon, the first openly gay figure skater on the US Olympic team, has been another standout star of these games despite not winning an individual medal, though he helped the US win bronze in the figure skating team event. Rippon, who had no major sponsors going into the games, picked up more than 400,000 followers on Instagram. His following had nearly quadrupled in size since the beginning of the games two weeks ago. “In general, when you have athletes or celebrities who come across as very authentic and very transparent, that tends to play very well on social media,” said Aaron Goldman, 4C chief marketing officer. “Adam in particular was always saying what was on his mind and speaking freely and that’s the essence and DNA of social media when done best.”Many athletes already had niche groups of followers, but the Olympics has opened a broader array of brands looking to reach the mainstream audiences they have gained. “There’s a global appeal to the Olympic Games that helps people break out of more narrow groups that they would be ordinarily be reaching,” Mr Goldman said.He added: “Instagram is a highly visual platform, and it’s certainly growing quite fast. It’s connected to Facebook, so all the data you have for your audience targeting that you have on Facebook you can also apply to Instagram.”The trick for athletes now will be to continue the momentum. Shelley Pisarra, senior vice-president of research and insights at Wasserman, said: “Especially coming off the Olympics, you can go into a dry period. You need to keep pushing content out there so you have a story to tell.”And while athletes do not do what they do ‘for the gram’ — slang for Instagram — the games gives them a boost they can benefit from until the next Winter Olympics.
18;UAA;Under Armour;2018-02-13T14:11:41Z;Under Armour lifted by overseas sales boost as North America fizzles;;Strong overseas growth is helping Under Armour make up for ailing North American sales.Shares in the sportswear maker were up more than 17 per cent in early trading on Tuesday after it delivered better-than-expected sales for the fourth quarter and issued a better marging outlook for this year as it moves to cut back on discounting.The stock is heavily shorted and analysts say Tuesday’s sharp move is also a sign of shortcoverings.Under Armour took in $1.36bn in revenues for the three months to end of December. That’s nearly 5 per cent higher than the prior year period and ahead of the $1.3bn analysts had forecast.Performance was driven by the surge in international sales. Growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa (up 45.5 per cent), Asia-Pacific (up 55.7 per cent) and Latin America (up 36 per cent) helped offset continued declines at its all-important North American division. The region, which generated about 76 per cent of total group sales, saw revenues drop 4.5 per cent to $1.02bn during the quarter.The company fell into a net loss of $87.9m however, as a result of one off charges related to US tax reforms and its ongoing resturcturing. Stripping this out, adjusted net loss was $1m - in line with estimates.Under Armour has until recently been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the trend for people to wear workout clothes outside the gym, and the company has capitalised on the so-called “athleisure” boom to buck the malaise that has afflicted the wider apparel retail market. But the company, which rose to prominence on the back of its partnership with NBA superstar Stephen Curry, has struggled over the past year as the athleisure trend fades and a growing number of competitors have enter the sportswear market. An abrupt slowdown in its key North American market forced the company to sharply lower its its full-year sales and profit guidance in October. Under Armour also announced further restructuring plans on Tuesday, building on the cost saving measures it initially unveiled in August.The company forecasts sales to grow in the low single-digits this year. Within this, North American sales are expected to fall again by a mid-single digit amount while those overseas will increase by more than 25 per cent. However gross margin is expected to recover, rising about 50 basis points to 45.5 per cent as the company pulls back on promotional activity and works to lower the cost of production.Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 14 to 19 cents a share, compared to the 19 cents reported in 2017.Shares in Under Armour, down more than a third by over the past 12 months, jumped 17 per cent to $16. 63 ahead of the bell.
19;UAA;Under Armour;2017-12-21T15:46:17Z;Contrary in the coal mine;Problem is that some things are cheap for a reason;Dualities define us. Liberals or conservatives. Cat or dog lovers. Bull market enthusiasts or contrarians, whose contempt for glib nostrums would extend to ones about dualities. They aim to sell what has made lots of money, then buy what hasn’t — the corporate disasters and almost terminally unloved. For instance, in the US this might suggest betting against Boeing and Wynn Resorts, as shares in the aerospace group and casino operator have almost doubled so far this year. At the other end, the sportswear maker Under Armour and Envision Healthcare are among the stocks to have halved in value. The danger is that some things are cheap for a reason. The member of the Euro Stoxx 600 index to inflict most pain on owners this year is Steinhoff International, the scandal-hit South African conglomerate. Its equity has lost more than nine-tenths of its value, and bondholders debate the recovery value of its debt. Buying veers into heroic double or quits territory. The way to dabble with softer contrariness is to stay close to the herd, considering very big companies unlikely to be trampled. Strategists at Citigroup, for instance, have totted up the results using the 250 largest members of the MSCI World. They calculate what happens when selling the 10 best performers of the previous year, and buying the 10 worst. Once in a while the contrarian strategy is spectacularly right, as it was in 2016. Backing a rebound in commodity producers and emerging markets produced gains of 31 per cent, nearly four times the MSCI rise. This has not been a year of reversals. Teva Pharmaceutical shares halved in 2016 then halved again in 2017. UK telecom operator BT followed a 22 per cent decline with a 24 per cent fall. Technology stocks surged ever upwards, investor enthusiasm undimmed. Contrarians today must fear the worst. They avoid Chinese and tech stocks above all, while embracing dull polluters that generate energy. It’s a view that seems likely to be wrong for some time yet. The irony is that to profit, lonely contrarians must draw the crowd their way.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

20;UAA;Under Armour;2017-12-15T17:55:34Z;Under Armour shares rise sharply on brokerage upgrade;S&P 500 retailing index firmer as broader market reaches new peak;Under Armour led a rally across the retail sector on Friday, climbing more than 9 per cent in its best one-day performance in more than seven months, after analysts with brokerage Stifel upgraded the stock.Jim Duffy, an analyst with the brokerage, said there was evidence of “improving sales quality” and cost management by the Baltimore-based company. Mr Duffy lifted his rating on Under Armour from “hold” to “buy” and changed his price target to $17.“We view Under Armour at a critical juncture for the brand,” Mr Duffy said. “Key to a rebound in the stock in 2018 is better clarity on the benefit of cost savings agendas and evidence the North American market has returned to a healthy pull-market with full-priced selling.”Shares rose 9.8 per cent to $15.17, pacing a gain across the industry.Every stock within the S&P 500 retailing index was up on the day, with traditional retailers such as Foot Locker, Kohl’s and Gap outperforming internet companies within the benchmark such as Amazon.The rebound in shares of the maker of shoes, leggings and tank tops popular with high school athletes follows a difficult year for the heavily shorted stock. Shares had more than halved this year before Friday’s rebound, and Under Armour’s market valuation remains 72 per cent below a high of $22.5bn set in 2015.The upgrade from Mr Duffy puts him in a small camp of analysts with buy or outperform recommendations. Less than 20 per cent of Wall Street stock analysts rate the company as such, according to Thomson Reuters data.Since the firing gun was shot after the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, shares of traditional retailers have come back in vogue. The S&P 500 retailing index has climbed more than 4 per cent, outperforming the broader market. Investors have pointed to somewhat better trends in the sector, although foot traffic at malls continues to decline and competition with online rivals remains fierce.Costco shares also climbed to a record on Friday, after the discount bulk retailer known for its $5 rotisserie chicken said sales and profits had eclipsed Wall Street expectations. Revenues in the three months to November 26 rose 13 per cent from a year before $31.8bn, while profits climbed 17 per cent to $640m.The company’s stock price rose 3.3 per cent to $192.73.Overall, the S&P 500 climbed 0.9 per cent to a new high of 2,675.81, as it appeared policymakers in Washington were moving closer to an agreement on tax reform.The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.6 per cent to 24,651.74 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2 per cent to 6,936.58.
21;UAA;Under Armour;2017-11-01T02:15:24Z;Under Armour: jog on;An untouchable chief executive is in trouble;Under Armour did not predict that people would start wearing leggings all day or that this “athleisure” trend would come at the expense of its more serious sportswear.The external factors that have led the brand into its current predicament are sizeable. A spate of retail bankruptcies such as at Sports Authority demonstrates the pressure. Still, two years ago shareholders were told that chief executive Kevin Plank was so good they needed to give up the right to fire him. They should not tolerate excuses.After falling a quarter on Tuesday, the shares have lost 85 per cent of their value since that rule change. If Mr Plank fails to arrest the decline, he will at least have provided a case study on why boards should grow a spine when a founder demands absolute power in order to show up to work.Two years ago Under Armour was valued at six times revenues. Speedy annual revenue growth, more than 30 per cent in the first quarter, seemed to justify the rating. On Tuesday, though, it reported its first year-on-year decline since going public in 2005.Under Armour was not quick enough to catch shifting consumer behaviour. The danger is that it scraps for sales rather than protects its margins. Mr Plank noted proudly that “we invented the $25 T-shirt” but also said the company was probably “a bit braggish” about how many products priced above $100 it could shift.The cost side contains more glaring errors. The company has spent more than $700m on acquisitions of technology companies such as MyFitnessPal. But it would be miraculous if Under Armour managed to become a pre-eminent digital hub for athletes when the likes of Nike and Fitbit have struggled.Debt coverage once looked a breeze. No longer. S&P cut its rating from double B plus to double B on Tuesday amid concern that net debt of about $1bn was supported by shrinking earnings of about $300m this year before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Fashions change, but sometimes the trend is clear.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly Best of Lex email at ft.com/newsletters.
22;UAA;Under Armour;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Under Armour slashes outlook, cites weak North American sales;;Shares in Under Armour tumbled 17 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday after the sportswear maker sharply lowered its full-year sales and profit guidance for a second time this year amid an abrupt downturn in its all-important North American market.The company said it now expects full-year revenue to grow by just a low single-digit at most, down from the 9-11 per cent growth it had predicted just three months ago.The group, which has been aggressively discounting to clear inventory, said 2017 gross margin will drop by 220 basis points, compared to the 160bps decline it had previously forecast. As a result of the margin hit and costs from its ongoing restructuring, operating income will be between $0 to $10m, a dramatic fall from the $160-180m it was expecting.“While our international business continues to deliver against our ambition of building a global brand, operational challenges and lower demand in North America resulted in third quarter revenue that was below our expectations,” said chief executive Kevin Plank. “Based on these issues in our largest market, we believe it is prudent to reduce our sales and earnings outlook for the remainder of 2017.”The outlook cuts come as Under Armour reported a 57 per cent drop in net income for the third quarter. While revenue fell 4.4 per cent to $1.4bn – far below the $1.48bn the market was expecting – net income for the period sank from $128.2m to $54.2m.The results were particularly grim in North America, which generates nearly 80 per cent of total group sales. The region saw revenues slump 12.1 per cent to $1.07bn during the quarter.Under Armour attributed the profit drop to the $60m in restructuring charges and a $29m writedown for its Connected Fitness business that it was forced to book during the quarter. Stripping these out, adjusted net income was $100m, or 22 cents per diluted share.Under Armour has until recently been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the trend for people to wear workout clothes outside the gym, and the company has capitalised on the so-called “athleisure” boom to buck the malaise that has afflicted the wider apparel retail market.But the company, which rose to prominence on the back of its partnership with NBA superstar Stephen Curry, has struggled over the past year as the athleisure trend fades and a growing number of competitors enter the sportswear market.Alongside traditional rivals such as Nike, Adidas and Lululemon, general retailers like Gap and Old Navy have also been making an aggressive push into athletic wear with their own lines of high tech joggers and sports bras.Shares in Under Armour, down more than 43 per cent so far this year, were down another 17 per cent ahead of the opening bell.(Photo: Bloomberg)
23;UAA;Under Armour;2017-08-16T12:21:24Z;Donald Trump attacks CEO ‘grandstanders’ as more quit panel;Union leaders and steel industry representative resign over Charlottesville;Donald Trump has ramped up his rhetorical assault on US business leaders, labelling corporate critics of his response to white nationalist violence in Virginia as “grandstanders” and lashing out at new targets.On Wednesday morning he took aim at Amazon, accusing it in a tweet of “doing great damage to tax paying retailers.”“Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt — many jobs being lost!”Mr Trump abandoned efforts to placate critics and again blamed “ both sides” for Saturday’s violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia at a combative press conference on Tuesday. Mr Trump’s initial equivocation after the violence drew condemnation from within his own Republican party and, unusually, the business community. Kenneth Frazier, the African-American chief executive of pharmaceuticals group Merck, set off a chain reaction on Monday when he resigned from a manufacturing panel convened by the president. The chief executives of chipmaker Intel and sportswear company Under Armour followed later in the day Monday. But the resignations and criticism continued to build on Tuesday, with the head of the US’s largest union, the AFL-CIO, an aide and a figure close to the steel industry all quitting Mr Trump’s manufacturing council and Walmart’s chief executive issuing a public rebuke of the president.On Tuesday PayPal said it would ensure its services were not used by hate groups— provided they had violated its acceptable use policy — following a report that organisers of the Charlottesville rally raised funds using the company’s online payment platform.The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups in the US, said PayPal had been “integral in raising money to orchestrate the event”.PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel was among the most vocal supporters in Silicon Valley of Mr Trump’s presidential run, and served on the president’s transition team following his November 9 victory.Mr Trump, whose election campaign flirted with white nationalist groups and who has prominent aides with links to the so-called alt-right, attacked Mr Frazier repeatedly via Twitter on Monday and broadened his social media assault on Tuesday, claiming that all of the chief executives leaving his council were replaceable. “For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council, I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS!” he said on Twitter. At a rambling afternoon press conference in New York called to discuss his infrastructure plans he expanded his attacks, accusing the executives leaving his council of doing so because they were ashamed of having factories overseas. “They’re not taking their jobs seriously as it pertains to this country,” he told reporters. “We want jobs [and] manufacturing in this country . . . Take a look at where their product is made. It’s made outside of our country. We want products made in the country.” He went on: “I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, they are leaving out of embarrassment. Because they make their products outside and I’ve been lecturing them . . . to bring it back to this country. That’s what I want. I want manufacturing to be back in the United States so that American workers can benefit.”His Tuesday press conference contrasted with the previous day’s carefully scripted appearance at the White House, when Mr Trump had sought to address the criticism of his reaction to Charlottesville by declaring “racism is evil”. He had also finally singled out groups such as the Ku Klux Klan by name after initially blaming Saturday’s violent clashes on “many sides”. The clashes came after heavily armed white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups gathered for a rally in the city to protest against the moving of a statue honouring southern secessionist Robert E Lee. One member of a white supremacist group has been charged with murder for driving his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, leading to the death of one and the injury of 19 others. In a statement released by the company, Walmart’s chief executive, Doug McMillon, praised the president’s contrite Monday statement, saying “we need that clarity and consistency in the future”. But he also offered a rebuke to Mr Trump’s initial response. “As we watched the events and the response from President Trump over the weekend, we too felt that he missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together by unequivocally rejecting the appalling actions of white supremacists,” Mr McMillon, who serves on a presidential advisory panel, said.At his Tuesday press conference, Mr Trump accused Mr McMillon of playing politics. “I've created over a million jobs since I was president. The country is booming,” he said. “So the head of Walmart, who I know — very nice guy — was making a political statement.”The resignations and rare open criticism have illustrated how for many top companies, an association with Mr Trump’s brand of politics has become a liability. Elon Musk, the high-profile founder of electric car company Tesla, resigned from the manufacturing council earlier this year after the president’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord. The concerns have also been manifested beyond individual companies. Shortly after Mr Trump’s initial Twitter outburst on Tuesday, Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group funded by the United Steelworkers union and parts of the US steel industry, said he was quitting the president’s manufacturing council. Leo Gerrard, the head of the United Steelworkers, has been a strong backer of Mr Trump’s protectionist trade policies, as has the steel industry. After Mr Trump’s afternoon press conference, Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO, the US’s largest union umbrella group, announced his resignation from the manufacturing council and that of Thea Lee, a former AFL-CIO deputy chief of staff and long-time adviser on trade policy.“We cannot sit on a council for a President who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism,” Mr Trumka and Ms Lee said in a joint statement. “President Trump’s remarks today repudiate his forced remarks yesterday about the KKK and neo-Nazis. We must resign on behalf of America’s working people, who reject all notions of legitimacy of these bigoted groups.”Other members of the business panels that advise Mr Trump have argued that they have a responsibility to shareholders to work with the president.Walmart’s Mr McMillon said: “Representing a company with the largest and one of the most diverse groups of [employees] in the US, and an even more diverse customer base . . . we believe we should stay engaged to try to influence decisions in a positive way.” Andrew Liveris, the chairman and chief executive of Dow Chemical and a member of the president’s manufacturing panel, condemned the violence in Charlottesville in his own statement Monday. But he also said he would continue “supporting policies that help create employment opportunities in manufacturing and rebuild the American workforce”.Similarly, Johnson & Johnson chief executive Alex Gorsky said that while he respected the decision of others to step down “as a matter of personal conscience”, and condemned “intolerance, racism and violence”, it was the responsibility of the company to remain engaged in public policy and the debate on healthcare.GE said Jeff Immelt, who announced his retirement earlier this year, would also remain on the president’s manufacturing council to allow the company “to participate in the discussion on how to drive growth and productivity in the US”.Additional reporting by Anna Nicolaou and David Crow in New York, and Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong

26;UAA;Under Armour;2017-08-15T05:18:19Z;Business leaders abandon Donald Trump over Charlottesville;President’s denunciation of white supremacists fails to stem defections;President Donald Trump condemned white supremacist groups by name for the first time on Monday after violent protests in Virginia, but a two-day delay before he acted prompted harsh criticism from business leaders and defections from a corporate advisory council by the chief executives of Intel, Merck, and Under Armour.Mr Trump had been strongly criticised by civil rights groups, business leaders and fellow Republicans for failing to denounce by name the Ku Klux Klan and other far-right groups behind Saturday’s protests.“We must unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence,” Mr Trump said in a hastily arranged TV appearance at the White House 48 hours after the troubles in Charlottesville.“Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminal and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.”While vice-president Mike Pence, attorney-general Jeff Sessions and Mr Trump’s daughter Ivanka, a White House adviser, had all condemned the white nationalist groups who had organised the protests, Mr Trump had earlier spoken out only against the “many sides” he said were to blame for the violence on Saturday.When asked later on Monday, during a signing ceremony for a trade action aimed at China, why it had taken him so long to condemn white nationalist groups directly, Mr Trump responded: “They’ve been condemned. They’ve been condemned.”The president’s full but belated denunciation of neo-Nazis failed to quell the wave of unease that swept through corporate America on Monday. Hours after Mr Trump tried to put the matter to rest, Brian Krzanich of Intel and Kevin Plank of Under Armour both quit the president’s American Manufacturing Council.Merck chief executive Ken Frazier had issued a statement on Twitter earlier on Monday saying he was resigning from the council “as a matter of personal conscience”. Other corporate leaders, including Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, called for a forthright denunciation of the far-right.Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, said the “terror of white supremacy and racist violence” was “an affront to America. We must all stand against it.”Mr Krzanich of Intel said he had resigned “to call attention to the serious harm our divided political climate is causing to critical issues”. He added: “I resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them.”The Intel boss had thrown his weight behind Mr Trump in the early days of his presidency, standing alongside the president at a White House event to announce plans to invest $7bn in manufacturing operations in the US. He also planned a fundraiser for Mr Trump at his home during the presidential campaign, though the event was cancelled after the plans became public.Some business leaders who have stayed on Mr Trump’s advisory councils, despite pressure from some workers and others to quit, have argued that they can do more good working with the White House than walking away. They include Michael Dell, founder of the US computer technology company and one of only two tech chiefs who are still on White House councils.In a statement earlier in the day, Mr Dell’s company said it would continue “engaging with the Trump administration and governments around the world to share our perspective on policy issues that affect our company, our customers and our employees”.But the latest defections, even after the president had bowed to pressure and tried to put the immediate problem to rest, highlighted the growing difficulty other members of corporate America are having in staying close to the White House.Before condemning the far-right protesters at the press conference, Mr Trump’s first public denunciation on Monday was of Merck’s Mr Frazier. He lashed out at the African American chief executive of the US drug manufacturer for his decision to step down from his advisory board. “Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President’s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!” Mr Trump tweeted. Mr Trump doubled down on his criticism of Mr Frazier later in the day, tweeting: “@Merck Pharma is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the US Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!”Mr Plank, Mr Krzanich and Mr Frazier are not the first to quit the president’s advisory councils in the wake of controversial statements by Mr Trump. Elon Musk of Tesla announced he was leaving the council in June, citing the White House’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord, while Bob Iger of Disney stepped down from a different White House advisory council for the same reason. However, neither Mr Musk nor Mr Iger faced the same kind of public dressing down from the president as Mr Frazier. Attorney-general Jeff Sessions said James Fields, the 20-year-old white nationalist who drove a car into a crowd of protesters on Saturday, killing one and injuring more than a dozen others, had perpetrated “an unacceptable evil attack” that met the legal definition of domestic terrorism, saying the justice department had launched a civil rights investigation into the event.However, the attorney-general pushed back against criticism of the president’s tepid response. “I think we’re making too much of this,” he told CBS News.Mr Pence, while calling out the KKK and white nationalists by name, issued a similar response. “I take issue with the fact that many in the national media spent more time criticising the president’s words than they did criticising those that perpetrated the violence to begin with.” Still, other chief executives on Mr Trump’s advisory council declined to criticise the president outright. Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo and a member of Mr Trump’s advisory council, condemned the violence in Charlottesville but declined to criticise the president directly. Authorities are bracing for more clashes between white nationalists and counter-protesters in the coming weeks. The original, right-wing protest was staged by those objecting to the removal of a statue dedicated Robert E Lee, the leading confederate general in the American Civil War.A free-speech rally is scheduled to take place in Boston over the coming weekend, although multiple civil rights groups have called on Boston’s mayor to postpone the event, citing safety concerns. Separately, there are concerns that white supremacist groups could stage similar demonstrations in Kentucky where Lexington Mayor Jim Gray has announced plans to remove two Confederacy monuments in his own city. Civil rights groups and experts on the far right have warned that white nationalists are likely to be emboldened by the events in Charlottesville and by Mr Trump’s reluctance to condemn them outright in the initial aftermath.“They’re thrilled. They’re in the headlines around the world day after day. This is what they wanted,” said Larry Sabato, a politics professor at the University of Virginia who witnessed the protests over the weekend.

27;UAA;Under Armour;2017-08-15T03:06:58Z;Intel CEO leaves Trump American Manufacturing Council;;Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of Intel, has become the latest US business leader to resign from Donald Trump’s American Manufacturing Council following violent clashes in Virginia.Mr Krzanich’s departure from the council follows that of Merck Pharma chief executive Ken Frazier and Kevin Plank, chief executive of Under Armour who also stepped down on Monday.The Intel chief executive said he had chosen to resign “to call attention to the serious harm our divided political climate is causing to critical issues”, adding that “political agendas” had sidelined the mission of rebuilding the country’s manufacturing base.Mr Krzanich said:I have already made clear my abhorrence at the recent hate-spawned violence in Charlottesville, and earlier today I called on all leaders to condemn the white supremacists and their ilk who marched and committed violence. I resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them.Mr Trump had received criticism from civil rights groups and fellow Republican for his failure to directly denounced the actions of white supremacist groups for protests on Saturday in Charlottesville. The president on Monday condemned by name the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists for their actions, some 48 hours after the violent protests.Mr Frazier announced on Monday he was resigning from the council “as a matter of personal conscience”. Under Armour’s chief executive Mr Plank said “Under Armour engages in innovation and sports, not politics.”
28;UAA;Under Armour;2017-08-15T01:24:17Z;Under Armour CEO latest to leave Trump council;;Another chief executive has resigned from Donald Trump’s American Manufacturing Council, in the wake of Mr Trump’s reluctance to criticise white supremacist groups.Kevin Plank, chief executive of Under Armour, the sports apparel company, announced on Monday he would be stepping down from the council.“I joined the American Manufacturing Council because I believe it was important for Under Armour to have an active seat at the table and represent our industry,” Mr Plank said in a statement. “We remain resolute in our potential and ability to improve American manufacturing. However, Under Armour engages in innovation and sports, not politics.”Merck chief executive Ken Frazier also announced on Monday he was resigning from the American Manufacturing Council “as a matter of personal conscience”.Mr Trump finally condemned white supremacist groups, including neo-Nazis and the KKK, in a hastily arranged White House press briefing on Monday. Previously, the president had blamed the violent clashes in Virginia last weekend on “many sides” – failing to single out white nationalist groups which had organised the protest.
29;UAA;Under Armour;2017-08-01T20:51:53Z;Under Armour slides as sportswear maker restructures;Previous tailwinds for the company are fading while competitive pressures increase;Shares in Under Armour tumbled 8.6 per cent on Tuesday after the sportswear maker reported its second straight quarter of losses and launched a major restructuring plan that would slice its 2017 operating profit by half.The decline was the stock’s steepest one-day drop in six months as investors were further spooked by the company’s move to lower its full-year sales growth outlook amid continued sluggishness in its all important North American business.Under Armour, which rose to prominence on the back of its partnership with NBA superstar Stephen Curry, has struggled over the past year as the so-called athleisure trend in which sportswear is worn outside of the gym fades.This shift in consumer shopping habit comes as Under Armour has to contend with an ever growing number of new entrants in the sportswear market.Alongside traditional rivals such as Nike, Adidas and Lululemon, general retailers like Gap and Old Navy have also been making an aggressive push into athletic wear with their own lines of high tech joggers and sports bras.For the three months to the end of June, net revenue rose nearly 9 per cent to $1.08bn, slightly ahead of the $1.07bn the market was expecting. However, sharply higher operating costs pushed Under Armour into a loss of $12.3m for the quarter, compared to a profit of $6.3m in the prior year period.Within this, North America, which accounts for more than half of total group revenue, only managed to eke out a 0.3 per cent year-on-year increase in sales.Weakness in the region is expected to leave full-year revenue growth at just 9 per cent to 11 per cent, versus the previous expectation of 11 per cent to 12 per cent.In a bid to turn things around, the company said that it will overhaul its business to better respond to shifting consumer tastes and reduce its reliance on the North American market.“We’re pivoting . . . from a US mostly apparel-centric to a global apparel footwear accessories portfolio,” said Kevin Plank, chief executive.As a result of the revamp, which will result in $110m-$130m of pre-tax charges, the company now expects operating income for the year to come in between $160m-180m, compared to its previous forecast of $320m.Earnings per share in 2017 will be between 18 cents to 21 cents, compared with the 42 cents analysts had projected.Elsewhere, Royal Caribbean Cruises made waves after the cruise ship operator lifted its full-year earnings outlook for a second time this year.Shares in the world’s second-largest cruise line operator closed up 3.4 per cent to $116.87 on Tuesday as investors cheered the guidance upgrade.The Miami-based company now expects adjusted earnings per share to come in between $7.35 to $7.45 this year, up from its previous forecast of $7.00-$7.20 and the $6.90-$7.10 range it was expecting at the start of the year.Royal Caribbean attributed the better than expected performance to a recovery in booking after business last year was held back by concerns over Zika — the mosquito-borne disease — and terrorist attacks in Europe and Turkey.The wider market edged higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day within striking distance of the 22,000 mark. The gauge was up 0.3 per cent at 21,963.92. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both advanced 0.2 per cent to 2,476.35 and 6,362.94, respectively.

Alongside traditional rivals such as Nike, Adidas and Lululemon, general retailers like Gap and Old Navy have also been making an aggressive push into atlethicwear with their own lines of high tech joggers and sportsbras.Analysts have also expressed concern that Under Armour spends too much in relation to the revenue it generates – a point that was underscored by the company’s latest results.For the three months to end of June, net revenue rose nearly 9 per cent to $1.08bn, slightly ahead of the $1.07bn the market was expecting. However sharply higher operating costs pushed Under Armour into a loss of $12.3m for the quarter, compared to a profit of $6.3m in the prior year period.In a bid to turn things around, the company said on Tuesday that it will overhaul its business to better respond to shifting consumer tastes and build up its online strategy.“We are utilizing 2017 to ensure that operations across our diverse portfolio of sport categories, distribution channels and geographies are optimised as we are building a stronger, faster and smarter company,” said chief executive Kevin Plank.As a result of the revamp, which will result in $110m-$130m of pre-tax charges, the company now expects operating income for the year to come in between $160m-180m, compared to its previous forecast of $320m.Earnings per share in 2017 will be between 18 cents to 21 cents, compared to the 42 cents analysts had projected.Net revenues meanwhile are expected to grow 9-11 per cent versus the previous expectation of 11-12 per cent growth, “reflecting moderation in the company’s North American business.”
31;UAA;Under Armour;2017-07-24T18:01:27Z;Sports retailers stumble on bleak Hibbett outlook;;"Shares in sports retailers deflated on Monday after Hibbett Sports, an Alabama-based company, issued a profit warning and a bleak sales outlook, citing “challenging sales trends”.Hibbett Sports shares plummeted 30 per cent to $13.82 and were on track for their biggest one-day loss on record, after the company said it expects comparable sales, a key industry metric, to fall 10 per cent in the second quarter.The company, which also announced the launch of its e-commerce platform on Monday, also warned that “significant pressure on gross margin” is expected to drive a loss of between 19 to 22 cents a share in the same period. That compared to Wall Street estimates for a profit of 15 cents, according to Bloomberg.Hibbett said it would provide additional detail and revised full-year guidance when it announces second quarter results next month.The gloomy outlook was enough to deliver a blow to shares of rival sports retailers.While athleisure, the moniker used for a trend which sees people wear work out gear outside of the gym, had helped certain sports retailers buck some of the broader retail pain, specialty sports retailers have however had a tough time amid great competition from online retailers and brands that were pushing direct-to-consumer sales.The challenging environment has prompted The Sports Authority; Vestis Retail Group, the operator of Sport Chalet; and Michigan Sporting Goods Distributors to all file for bankruptcy protection."
32;UAA;Under Armour;2017-05-11T11:56:10Z;Kohl’s sales woes continue despite Under Armour tie-up;;A bet on athleisure did little to reverse the ongoing sales decline at Kohl’s during the first quarter.The discount department store on Thursday reported its fifth straight quarter of like-for-like sales drop despite a much lauded tie-up with Under Armour to sell the athletic apparel’s products in its 1,160 stores.For the three months to end of April, comparable sales growth – a key industry metric that compares year-on-year sales at stores open at least 12 months – fell 2.7 per cent, a much steeper fall than the 0.6 per cent dip that the market was expecting.Revenue, which fell 3.2 per cent to $3.84bn, also fell short of analyst estimate of $3.9bn.Like its peers, Wisconsin-based Kohl’s has struggled with a confluence of headwinds that have hit the US retail sector in recent years. Department stores in particular have been hard hit by declining mall traffic, the quickening rise of online shopping and changing consumer shopping habits that value experience — such as dining and travelling — over buying “stuff”.In response, Kohl’s has sought to reposition its stores in smaller, off-mall locations. It also launched a turnaround plan in 2014, called the Greatness Agenda, to focus on more exclusive offerings that would set itself apart from department store rivals.As part of this plan, the company struck a deal with Under Armour and started selling the group’s apparel, accessories and footwear at its stores and online in March. Company representatives have called it the biggest brand launch — in terms of product — in Kohl’s history and the campaign is aimed at attracting younger shoppers who tend to shun department stores.Kohl’s did not provide an update on how sales of Under Armour products have fared since the launch. In a statement chief executive Kevin Mansell said: “We are encouraged by the significant improvement in sales and traffic for the March and April period, after a weak February start to the first quarter.”Net income for the period surged to $66m, from the $17m reported last year. The gains were largely due to results last year being held back by a series of impairments and one off costs.Excluding these, adjusted net earnings rose 14 per cent to 39 cents per diluted share, ahead of expectations for 29 cents a share.Shares in Kohl’s, down more than 18 per cent so far this year, fell another 2.5 per cent in pre-market trading.
33;UAA;Under Armour;2017-04-27T18:06:20Z;Under Armour shares poised for best day since Jan 2016;;Under Armour shares were poised for their best day in more than a year after the workout retailer’s first quarter results came in better than analysts had feared.Shares in the Maryland-based company were up more than 10 per cent to $21.70 and on track for the biggest one-day gain since January 2016.Revenues rose 7 per cent to $1.1bn in the first three months of the year – in line with estimates. Sales growth surged in Latim America, Asia-Pacific and EMEA but fell 1 per cent in North America as new distribution was offset by business lost to bankruptcies, like Sports Authority, in 2016, the company said.Under Armour also bled red ink for the first time in its history, swinging to a loss of $2.3m during the quarter, from a profit of $19.2m in the year ago period. On a per share basis, the company reported a loss of a penny, compared with earnings of 4 cents a year ago. However, that was smaller than the 4 cent loss that analysts had forecast.The company, which has benefitted from successful partnerships with the likes of NBA star Steph Curry and the athleisure trend, in which people sport athletic apparel even when they are not working out, has been under pressure recently. Concerns that Under Armour is losing market share to rivals Nike and Adidas and that the atheleisure trend was past its peak have weighed on the company’s shares. Indeed, the stock was down more than 30 per cent year-to-date prior to Thursday’s quarterly results.In an effort to grow its business the company is pushing into the lifestyle category with its Under Armour Sportswear (UAS) line that interprets sportswear with fashion and tailored looks. And on the company’s earnings call founder and chief executive Kevin Plank said “we are hitting the benchmarks we set for ourselves to make lifestyle a core competency of our brand”.The company said it continues to expect net revenue growth of between 11 to 12 per cent this year to $5.4bn.Analysts at Jefferies argue that with these efforts, Under Armour is one of the few brands that matters in the athletic space, adding that their consumer surveys and store checks indicate an “inflection is forming”.“Results this morning gave us greater conviction that the UAA brand is here to stay as one of the few that matter in the athletic space,” Randal Konik, an analyst at Jefferies, said. “Against a backdrop of negative sentiment and conjecture that the brand is permanently impaired, Under Armour pulled out a beat with top-line growth meeting expectations, GM better than feared, and well-controlled inventories.”But not everyone is as optimistic.Analysts at JPMorgan note that Thursday’s advance reflects a relief rally and the company is not “out of the woods” yet.
34;UAA;Under Armour;2017-03-24T15:16:53Z;Under Armour shares perk up on Jefferies upgrade;;Under Armour shares jogged higher on Friday after analysts at Jefferies upgraded the stock citing data from a survey that shows the brand has strengthened and arguing that “overly-negative sentiment creates a buying opportunity”.Shares in the Maryland-based retailer rose 4 per cent to $18.13 — its biggest one-day gain since December — after analysts at Jefferies lifted their rating on the stock to “buy” from “hold” and raised their price target to $27, from $19 previously.That helped the bull camp on Wall Street grow, giving the stock its eighth “buy” rating. Under Armour has 22 “hold” ratings and 5 “sell” ratings, according to Bloomberg data.Jefferies refreshed its survey of 2,000 consumers across the US and found that compared to three years ago, they have greater recognition of the Under Armour brand and think it is less expensive.40 per cent polled this time around thought Under Armour was expensive, compared with 62 per cent three years ago, the survey found. “We view survey responses related to perceived affordability as equally favourable, and indicative of consumers attaching a greater view of value to UA product for the price paid,” Randal Konik, an analyst at Jefferies, said.Moreover, while Under Armour did lose market share to Adidas last year — 18 per cent said Under Armour was the brand of athletic apparel the most liked to wear, compared with 21 per cent for Adidas, compared with 20 per cent and 13 per cent respectively three years ago.Mr Konik also said Adidas’ share gains are peaking.Companies like Under Armour, Nike, and Lululemon have in recent years been beneficiaries of the so-called athleisure trend that sees people wear work out gear even when they are not exercising. And there has been some concern about slowing momentum in athleisure as denim appears to be making a comeback.But the survey also showed that compared to three years ago nearly double the respondents had purchased athletic apparel in the past 12 months. And 10 per cent more wear athletic apparel while not physically active at least four to five times a week. And he argues that the company’s lifestyle assortment with tailored jackets and streamlined trousers could “highlight a new opportunity theoretically broader than even athletic”.Finally, Mr Konik notes that Under Armour is the most heavily-shorted stock in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index, with 24.4 per cent of the float sold short, as the company has posted downbeat results and lowered guidance over the past two quarters. But he sees many avenues for growth at Under Armour, especially overseas and in women’s categories, and argues that the company stands to benefit from proposed tax reforms.“Current trading levels are unwarranted, particularly given other brands (e.g., Adidas) have traded higher with worse fundamentals,” he said.The once high-flying company has seen its fall nearly 33 per cent so far this year, on top of a 30 per cent drop in 2016.
35;UAA;Under Armour;2017-02-01T15:54:30Z;S&P junks Under Armour a day after disappointing earnings;;Intense competition, a weak retail environment and pricing pressures in the key North American market have prompted S&P to downgrade Under Armour’s credit rating to junk a day after its shares slumped on disappointing quarterly results.S&P analysts said Wednesday that they were cutting the athletic clothing maker’s rating one notch from BBB- to BB+, pushing it below the line separating investment grade from junk. The ratings agency said its outlook for the company was negative.Credit analyst Mariola Borysiak said:“The company recently reported a weaker-than-expected operating performance during its important fourth quarter. This was attributable to weaker-than-expected execution on the company’s growth plan, increasing competition and a poor retail environment in North America, leading to price pressure as well as rising costs to support growth that erode margins and profitability. We believe Under Armour’s weak operating execution under its aggressive growth strategy weigh on our assessment on its business risk profile.”Yesterday, Under Armour shares plunged by as much 28 per cent on Tuesday after it revealed results from the critical holiday shopping season that badly missed analysts’ expectations. The company’s shares are largely flat since the start of trading Wednesday.Another ratings agency, Moody’s, on Wednesday affirmed its Baa2 rating for Under Armour – keeping it two notches above junk – while changing its outlook from stable to negative, owing to “weaker-than-expected fourth quarter 2016 operating performance and significant downward revision in guidance for 2017,” according to Moody’s analyst Mike Zuccaro.
36;UAA;Under Armour;2017-01-31T19:46:52Z;Under Armour: under pressure;Retailer built on growth faces tough match with the value environment;Well, it depends on which way you are inflecting. Under Armour, the once-high flying sports clothing maker, on Tuesday reported weak fourth-quarter earnings along with a meagre 2017 outlook.Kevin Plank, its founder and chief executive, while candidly describing Under Armour’s self-inflicted wounds, said that this moment could be an “inflection point” — a juncture where the company could reinvent itself.The outfitter, which originated in Mr Plank’s car boot 20 years ago, is one of the great start-up stories of this generation.However, Mr Plank’s optimism flies in the face of a brutal implosion among retailers. He still aspires to build a $10bn company (2016 revenue clocked in at just under $5bn) but belying this, shares in Under Armour have fallen 40 per cent since 2015. They shed another quarter, $3bn of market value, on Tuesday.Of the seven significant US retail bankruptcies in 2016, two were at chains selling Under Armour gear (Sports Authority and Golfsmith). Several other retailers are teetering, battered by online competition that has contributed to a price war.Under Armour fourth-quarter sales rose at just 12 per cent against expectations closer to 20 per cent. Operating profits dipped 6 per cent. Revenue for 2017 is only forecast to grow a tenth or so and earnings are set to decline.With the environment tough and results slipping, Under Armour’s strategy looks threadbare.Premium pricing and forays into women’s clothing, ecommerce and connected fitness have not all worked out for the business.Flops such as these require some accountability. On Tuesday, Under Armour announced that Chip Molloy, the finance chief, would be departing for “personal reasons”. Mr Plank, however, is firmly planted. Under Armour’s triple-class share structure guarantees that.A turnround would require this visionary entrepreneur to morph into an operations wizard. Until Mr Plank makes that leap, investors should jog briskly in the opposite direction.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
37;UAA;Under Armour;2017-01-31T18:58:38Z;Under Armour suffers as shoppers shed their gym clothes;Retailer’s ‘athleisure’ winning streak comes to abrupt end as sales growth falls;Under Armour shed nearly a quarter of its value on Tuesday after the athletic wear maker reported a dramatic slowdown in sales growth during the fourth quarter and sharply scaled back its revenue outlook for 2017.The stock fell by as much as 28.1 per cent — the most in nine years — before recovering slightly to trade down 25.5 per cent at $21.55 by midday in New York. The decline takes the share slump over the past 12 months to over 74 per cent.Under Armour has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the trend for people to wear workout clothes outside the gym, and the company has capitalised on the so-called “athleisure” boom to deliver 26 straight quarters of at least 20 per cent sales growth.But that winning streak came to an abrupt halt during the last three months of last year as intensifying competition in the sector compounded the malaise that has afflicted the wider apparel retail market.Revenue rose just 12 per cent to $1.3bn during the December quarter, below the $1.4bn the market was expecting. It is also a marked deceleration from the 30 per cent sales growth recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015, and the weakest pace logged in over seven years.Net income, meanwhile, fell 1 per cent to $105m, or 23 cents per diluted share, confounding expectations for an increase to $113.2m.Kevin Plank, Under Armour’s chief executive, said that “numerous challenges and disruptions in North American retail tempered our fourth-quarter results”.Sentiment was further battered by the 2017 sales forecast issued by the Baltimore-based company. It sees sales this year growing 11-12 per cent — a big step down from the low 20 per cent growth range the company was projecting just three months ago.“Given investments (including many fixed in nature such as sports endorsements), slowing revenue trajectory is particularly concerning, ” said Jim Duffy at Stifel.Under Armour also said chief financial officer Chip Molloy will be leaving the company at the end of the week for “personal reasons”. He will be replaced by David Bergman, senior vice-president of corporate finance.
38;UAA;Under Armour;2017-01-31T12:58:17Z;Under Armour plunges 27% as sales growth slows sharply;;Is the athleisure boom over? Investors seem to think so.Under Armour, a clothing retailer that has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the trend of people wearing work out clothes outside the gym, saw its shares plunge more than 27 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday after the company badly missed expectations for its fourth-quarter sales and earnings and announced the departure of its chief financial officer.For the three months to end of December, revenue rose 12 per cent to $1.3bn, below the $1.4bn the market was expecting. It is also a sharp slowdown from the 30 per cent sales growth recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015, and the weakest pace logged in over seven years.Net income, meanwhile, fell 1 per cent to $105m, or 23 cents per diluted share, confounding expectations for an increase to $113.2m, or 24 cents a share.Kevin Plank, Under Armour’s chairman and chief executive, said that “numerous challenges and disruptions in North American retail tempered our fourth quarter results”.Gross margin fell to 44.8 per cent during the quarter, compared to the 48 per cent recorded in the year-ago period as a tough retail environment, particularly in the US, forced the company to discount more heavily to clear inventory.Although the company said it expects full-year sales for 2017 to grow 11-12 per cent to nearly $5.4bn (compared to the $4.8bn recorded in 2016), the results will further reinforce the view that the company, which has doubled sales roughly every three years, can no longer support its pace of growth.Under Armour also said chief financial officer Chip Molloy will be leaving the company at the end of the week for “personal reasons”. He will be replaced by David Bergman, senior vice president of corporate finance.Shares in the company, down 66 per cent over the past 12 months, fell another 27 per cent in pre-market trading.
39;UAA;Under Armour;2016-10-25T13:30:15Z;Under Armour shares tumble on downbeat growth outlook;;Under Armour shares fell out of fashion on Tuesday after the athletic wear maker unveiled disappointing sales outlook and said its margins slid last quarter.Shares in the Baltimore, Maryland-based company fell 15 per cent — poised for its worst day since 2008 — after chief financial officer, Chip Molloy, said on the company’s earnings call that while it expects to “significantly outpace” growth in the apparel industry, the “growth rate going forward will be less than expected for our investor day 2015″.Under Armour also said its gross margin slid to 47.5 per cent in the third quarter, down from 48.8 per cent a year ago, reflecting negative impacts from the timing of liquidation, increased promotions, and foreign exchange rates. The company had previously cut its outlook after specialty retailer Sports Authority had begun its bankruptcy proceedings.Profits climbed to $128.2m or 29 cents a share in the three months ended in September, up from $100.5m or 23 cents a share in the year ago period. That topped analysts’ expectations for 25 cents.The retailer, which has seen its footwear sales surge on the back of NBA star Stephen Curry’s shoe line, said sales jumped 22 per cent from a year ago to $1.5bn, ahead of analysts’ estimates.However, Under Armour, which had been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the athlesiure trend, in which people wear work out clothes outside the gym, has however seen its shares decline 9 per cent so far this year amid concerns that growth at the company is cooling.While sales have now jumped more than 20 per cent for 26 straight quarters, the pace of growth slowed for the third consecutive quarter. Moreover, this was the slowest sales growth in six years.
40;UAA;Under Armour;2016-09-27T20:33:38Z;Nike shares trip up on downbeat future sales metric;;Investors soured on Nike shares after the athletic clothing and gear maker disclosed downbeat futures orders and reported a drop in its gross margin.Nike shares fell more than 4 per cent in extended trading after the Oregon-based company said futures orders, a key indicator of future sales, rose just 1 per cent in North America, the company’s biggest market, below analysts’ estimates for 5 per cent growth.Futures order growth in Western Europe, emerging markets and Japan, which accounted for about 32 per cent of the company’s overall revenues last year, however eclipsed forecasts. Futures orders in China grew 19 per cent, but were just shy of expectations.Nike also said profits rose to $1.25bn or 73 cents a share in the three months ended in August, compared with $1.2bn or 67 cents a share in the year ago period. Sales rose 8 per cent to $9.1bn.Analysts were looking for earnings of 56 cents a share, on sales of $8.9bn.The company however said that its gross margin declined by 2 percentage points to 45.5 per cent as a result of one-time factors like foreign exchange, the company’s decision to exit the golf business and a higher mix of off-price goods in its sales.Nike has benefitted from the so-called athleisure trend that sees people wear work out gear outside the gym. But the company has also faced increasing competition from rivals Under Armour and Adidas.Nike shares have declined more than 11 per cent so far this year.
41;UAA;Under Armour;2016-09-07T05:50:59Z;Katy Perry in JV with HK-listed Global Brands;;“Show ‘em what you’re worth,” the lyric goes, and Katy Perry looks set to do just that in a new joint venture with Global Brands Group, the Hong Kong-listed apparel company.The deal aims to grow the pop star’s brand into new consumer product categories, expanding on the recently-formed partnership between GBG and Ms Perry to develop an eponymous footwear collection for the latter.This is familiar territory for GBG, owned by Hong Kong’s Fung family, as the company entered into a branding deal in 2014 with football superstar David Beckham.Ms Perry said in a statement:I am creatively stimulated and energized to be a real contributor in the affordable shoe industry. I believe your shoes can be the punctuation to your personality, and therefore I created a whole line of shoes that includes individualistic, colorful, dynamic designs for everyone, especially those who want to experiment with taking a bold step forward. I’m excited that Global Brands Group is my partner because they hear and trust my vision, and bring expertise and knowledge that I’m absorbing and applying in a smart and creative way.Bruce Rockowitz, chief executive of GBG, said:We are extremely pleased about the positive response we have already received around the footwear collection, and look forward to the exciting opportunities this expanded partnership has to offer.GBG has a portfolio of brands it controls and licences, including Calvin Klein, Under Armour, Juicy Couture and Quiksilver, among others.The company’s share price was hardly roaring – or going off like a firework – today, trading 2.5 per cent lower versus a 0.3 per cent slide for the territory’s benchmark Hang Seng index. GBG shares are down 46.3 per cent so far this year.
42;UAA;Under Armour;2016-09-02T22:00:41Z;Lululemon’s 2016 rally pegged back;US stocks rally but shares of cruise ship operators face sell-off;Lululemon shares recorded their biggest one-day drop this year after the US maker of yoga apparel reported a key sales metric that came in shy of analysts’ forecasts in the second quarter.Shares in Lululemon fell 10.6 per cent to $68.57 after the retailer said its total like-for-like sales, which include both comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales, rose by 5 per cent on a constant currency basis in the quarter to the end of July. Analysts had forecast a rise of 5.9 per cent.The weak sales figure accompanied upbeat earnings. Net income climbed to $53.6m, or 39 cents a share, compared with $47.7m, or 34 cents a share, in the same period in 2015. That topped expectations for 38 cents a share.Net revenues rose 14 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $514.5m, just shy of expectations for $514.7m. But notably, the company said its inventories declined 1 per cent.Despite the sell-off in Lululemon shares, analysts took a more positive view on the results.“Although the reaction to shares is hardly a surprise given lofty expectations and a lighter than hoped for comp, the two-year trend actually accelerated and the quality of the [comparable sales] was hard to ignore as it came with 360bps of product margin improvement, a clear [gross margin] inflection,” Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Nomura, said.Mark Altschwager, an analyst at Baird noted that “earnings acceleration” is firmly under way.Indeed, Lululemon, has come a long way since 2013 when the retailer recalled its signature yoga pants amid controversy they were transparent, and Chip Wilson, its chief executive, resigned over remarks apparently blaming women for the problem. The company, like Nike and Under Armour, has benefited from the “athleisure” trend in which people increasingly wear sports gear outside the gym.Friday’s decline, which trimmed Lululemon’s year-to-date gains to 30.7 per cent, came alongside a rally in US stocks.At the close, the S&P 500 had climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,179.9 as investors digested soft US jobs numbers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to 18,491.9, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 5,249.9.Elsewhere, the shares of cruise ship operators sustained a wave of selling on the back of a bearish note from Morgan Stanley.A survey of travel agents indicated that “although the Caribbean and in particular Alaska enjoyed a strong summer, booking momentum for the rest of 2016 and 2017 seems to have slowed somewhat”, analyst Jamie Rollo at Morgan Stanley said.“Almost universally, the panel (of agents) mentioned falling rates, growing promotions, and rising agent incentives, which given sluggish volumes likely indicate general demand weakness rather than operators attempting to build a base of business,” Mr Rollo added.Further, “a few” travel agents said that concerns about the Zika virus were “having a small impact, though the cruise lines have denied this”.The signs of “rough seas” prompted Mr Rollo to cut his view on Carnival Corp to “underweight”. The group’s stock was off by 4.7 per cent to $46.39 on Friday. Fellow cruise-ship operator Royal Caribbean Cruises declined by 3.7 per cent to $70.01.
43;UAA;Under Armour;2016-08-11T11:43:05Z;Kohl’s cuts profit outlook;;Another quarter and another profit warning from a department store.Kohl’s lowered its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to $3.80 to $4.00 a share, from its previous outlook for $4.05 to $4.25 a share. This compared to analysts estimates for $3.83 a share.The Wisconsin-based department store’s guidance cut comes after Macy’s, a bellwether for department stores, trimmed its profit outlook earlier this year ahead of the important back-to-school shopping season.Kohl’s also said same-store sales, a key industry metric, fell 1.8 per cent in second quarter, however the pace of decline slowed from the 3.9 per cent drop in the first quarter.News that the sales decline in the company was slowing, alongside a strong decrease in inventory and rise in gross margin was well received by investors.Shares in Kohl’s jumped 8 per cent to $41.20 in pre-market trading as gross margin climbed to 39.5 per cent, up 400 basis points from the first quarter.Kohl’s said profits rose to $221m or $1.22 a share in the three months ended July 30, compared with $211m or $1.07 a share in the year ago period. Sales slid 2 per cent to $4.18bn.Analysts on Wall Street were looking for earnings of $1.04 a share, on sales of $4.16bn. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.22 a share, topped forecasts for $1.03 a share.The results come as department stores continue to compete with a surge in online retailers. Moreover, the rise of off-price retailers like TJX Cos, that sell designer brands at a discount, have also eaten into their sales.In an effort to lure customers to its stores, Kohl’s last month announced a partnership deal with Under Armour, the sportswear maker popular with middle class consumers. The deal could help Kohl’s benefit from the so-called “athleisure” trend, that sees people wear work out gear outside of the gym, that has helped sales at companies like Under Armour and Nike.Kohl’s shares have declined 20 per cent so far this year.
44;UAA;Under Armour;2016-08-04T09:35:33Z;Adidas makes up ground on rivals;Sportswear group posts fastest growth as North American sales surge;Adidas said that its revenues in North America surged in the second quarter as it works to turn round its fortunes in the world’s biggest sportswear market.The world’s second largest sportswear group by sales has been trying to make up ground in North America after losing its number two position there to Under Armour in 2014, and falling further behind Nike.In the three months to the end of June, Adidas posted the fastest growth of the trio, with its sales in the region climbing 22.6 per cent to €788m, allowing it to overtake Under Armour again. Under Armour said last week that its sales had risen 21.5 per cent to $827m, while Nike’s sales were flat at $3.7bn in the three months to the end of May.Adidas also posted rapid growth in western Europe, with sales jumping 26 per cent to €1.2bn, and in greater China, where its revenue rose 21 per cent to €685m. However, sales in Russia and Latin America both fell as Adidas was hit by currency fluctuations.The German group said in an unscheduled announcement last week that its overall sales in the second quarter were 21 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. Profits doubled to €291m, thanks partly to a one-off gain from the termination of a sponsorship deal with the English premier league football club, Chelsea.Herbert Hainer, presenting his last results as chief executive before handing over to former Henkel boss Kasper Rorsted at the end of September, said that the results were “stellar”, and claimed that they gave the“perfect platform to drive sustainable top- and bottom-line improvements for the years to come”.However, while analysts said that the overall results were solid, some found the development of Adidas’s gross margin — which was 48.3 per cent last year, and which the group says will come in between 48 per cent and 48.3 per cent this year — was less impressive.“The gross margin guidance revision was expected but the quantum of the revision looks a little disappointing at -30bp to flat given the strong channel and product mix Adidas is enjoying this year,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst.Adidas said that revenues at its golf business — the bulk of which it is trying to sell — were 7 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. Mr Hainer said in a call with journalists that there were “several interested parties” in the sale and that discussions were continuing. Nike said on Wednesday that it would stop selling golf equipment, but Mr Hainer said he did not expect this to have any impact on Adidas.Shares in Adidas, which have more than doubled over the past 12 months, were down 3 per cent in morning trading in Frankfurt.

US data showing falling crude inventories helped oil prices rise, with some analysts also pointing to a potential strike in Norway — the largest crude oil producer in western Europe — as contributing to the rally.Murphy Oil, an oil and gas exploration and production company, helped lead the sector’s rebound, rising 6.4 per cent to $32.01.Marathon Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil refinery in the US, rose 4.4 per cent to $37.26. Noble Energy gained 3.5 per cent to $36.31.It was a different story for Texas-based Southwestern Energy. Its stock price fell 6.2 per cent on Wednesday to $13.03, the worst performance across the S&P 500 index, after the company offered 75m common shares to the public.The company intends to use proceeds from the stock offering to repay $375m of debt. Its share price rose by more than 10 per cent on Tuesday after extending maturities and tweaking conditions on more than $2bn of outstanding credit.The financials sector also had a strong rally, rising 2.3 per cent. The sector had been hard hit after the UK’s vote to leave the EU and was braced for the release by the Federal Reserve of bank’s stress test results on Wednesday evening.Utilities also made gains after initially lagged behind the broader stock market rally, rising 0.3 per cent. The sector typically performs well when investors are defensive, making its underperformance indicative of some renewed risk appetite.Elsewhere, Nike, the sports clothing and equipment brand, saw its stock price bounce 3.8 per cent to $55.13, having fallen by more than 6 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday following a mixed earnings report.Nike reported profits of 49 cents a share for its fiscal fourth quarter, above analysts’ expectation of 48 cents a share. But the focus turned to underwhelming revenues growth, which rose 6 per cent to $8.24bn, below the market’s target of $8.28bn.“We remain bullish on both secular and structural tailwinds for Nike’s business,” said analysts at Stifel. “Stiffer [currency] headwinds and a more volatile macro picture, however, leave us slightly more cautious on near-term fundamentals.”Rival sporting goods producer Under Armour rose 5.9 per cent to $39.75, making it one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 index.Alcoa, the metals producer, outlined plans for its split into two companies, hiving off mining, refining and smelting from the more profitable materials production business that serves transportation and construction industries.The announcement sent the company’s stock down 2.5 per cent to $9.10. The spun off company will retain the Alcoa name, while the remaining assets will begin trading under a new name of Arconic.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 1.7 per cent to 2,070.8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.6 per cent to 17,694.7 and the Nasdaq Composite increased 1.9 per cent to 4,779.3.

It reported strong revenue growth internationally when comparing the most recent quarterly performance with the corresponding period last year. But North American revenue growth fell flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis.The company cited congested ports on the west coast of the US, which delayed the delivery of merchandise into the final three months of fiscal year 2015. Nike also had to sell existing inventory at a discount, depressing margins.Inventories are back to normal. Ports have caught up with the backlog, and shipments are arriving. North America should pick up speed again.Under Armour and a resurgent Adidas are challenging Nike in the US. But with robust sales growth elsewhere, and inventory issues resolved, the sell-off looks overdone. It remains a strong contender.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
47;UAA;Under Armour;2016-06-28T20:28:07Z;Nike sinks as key metric misses Wall St views;;The shares of Nike fell 6 per cent late on Tuesday after the apparel maker said a key indicator of future sales missed Wall Street estimates in its last quarter.The Oregon-based group said worldwide futures orders, or orders that retailers make for delivery over the next few months, rose by 11 per cent on a year-on-year basis, excluding currency impacts, in the quarter to the end of May. That fell short of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg of an increase of 13 per cent.The figure is closely-watched since it is considered to be a good predictor of future revenues.The Dow component’s shares have fallen by 15.6 per cent this year on worries about rising competition from the likes of Under Armour and Adidas, as well as headwinds from the bankruptcy and liquidation of Sports Authority, the US sportswear retailer.Meanwhile, Nike’s sales in the fiscal fourth quarter climbed 6 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $8.24bn, shy of estimates of $8.28bn. Net income fell to $846m from $865m. Earnings per share of 49 cents topped expectations by one cent.Nike’s shares dropped 6.3 per cent in after hours trading on Tuesday.
48;UAA;Under Armour;2016-06-24T05:05:24Z;Latest spin on tennis equipment is set to change the game;Endorsements and innovation are king in a competitive market;The tennis equipment industry is confronting what it regards as two unhappy birthdays. Roger Federer is 35 in August and Rafael Nadal was 30 this month, which means both are approaching the end of their careers.Player endorsement is a crucial factor in selling tennis gear and these charismatic stars have proved highly effective in that regard.“Federer and Nadal are the two that can really sell products,” says Rohun Davda, manager of Wigmore Sports, a London specialist tennis retailer.Federer receives a reported $2m a year from Wilson, the US manufacturer, to use its rackets. Both he and Nadal have longstanding deals to wear the clothing of Nike, which is the world’s market leader in tennis clothes, followed by Adidas.Jolyn de Boer, executive director of the US Tennis Industry Association, says the pair also inspire people to play the game. “And the more people play, the more they will buy equipment,” she says.Nadal has also played a significant part in the rapid rise of Babolat, the French company, having used its rackets throughout his career. “During the last 15 or so years Babolat have gone from nothing to number one brand in the world,” Mr Davda says.The Lyon-based company, founded in 1875, began as a racket string manufacturer. It made its first rackets in 1994. At that time the global industry had been dominated for years by Wilson and Prince, also of the US, and Head, the Dutch-Austrian manufacturer.Babolat began a strong marketing campaign that signed leading juniors around the world to use its rackets, it kitted out club coaches and crucially hit the jackpot in the top players it sponsored. Carlos Moya won the French Open in 1998 using a Babolat racket and was followed by grand-slam title winners Andy Roddick, Kim Clijsters and Nadal.Head estimates that global racket sales were 7.9m in 2015, with a wholesale value of €290m. Racket manufacturers do not release their sales figures, but the industry consensus is that Babolat and Wilson top the world list, with Head third and Japan’s Yonex fourth.The leading brands have innovated to remain at the top. In 2013, Head became the first to produce a racket made of graphene, the substance that is 200 times stronger than steel yet ultra light and flexible.More recently Babolat introduced a racket with an integrated sensor that records a player’s strokes digitally and Wilson has aimed to provide greater spin on shots with a new stringing system.While Nike and Adidas lead the tennis clothing market over old rivals such as Fila, Lacoste and Lotto, bold entries have been made by Under Armour of the US and Uniqlo of Japan. The Japanese company signed current world number one Novak Djokovic in 2012 and Under Armour began a four-year, £15m deal with Andy Murray last year.The clothing sector has gained a significant boost this century from the replacement of cotton by polymer materials, such as polyester, that absorb sweat and move it to the fabric’s surface where it evaporates, allowing players to feel cooler and more comfortable.It is shoes, however, that are the most important equipment item for tennis players after the racket. Comfort, cushioning, support and grip for feet facing the varying challenges of hard, clay and grass courts are crucial.Footwear is also the biggest earner of all tennis equipment. The US Tennis Industry Association says total spending in 2014 on shoes by tennis players in the US, the world’s biggest tennis market, was $227.8m compared with $188.4m on clothing and $174.6m on rackets.Djokovic in particular has highlighted the importance of shoes. After ending his clothing deal with Adidas in 2009, he switched first to Italian brand Sergio Tacchini before uniting with Uniqlo, yet throughout these two changes has refused to wear anything other than his favoured Adidas footwear.The world’s best player has found the make that suits him best, and he is sticking to it.Wimbledon may epitomise tennis tradition with its grass courts, all-white dress code and blazered officials, but the wider game is in the grip of a digital revolution.Changes in racket technology have predominantly been about materials, progressing over the past 40 years from wood to aluminium, steel and then graphite and graphene. The most recent development, however, has been digital sensors that attach to rackets and record a player’s shot selection, power, spin and ball contact accuracy.Leading technology company Sony, and smaller ones such as Zepp Labs in California and 9 Degrees Freedom of Singapore with its Qlipp brand, have all produced such gadgets. These stream the data to players’ smartphones or computers, helping them to analyse their game.The sensors are attached to the base of the strings or slot on the end of the handle, or as in Babolat’s case, are integrated in the handle.Tennis courts have also been digitised. American company PlaySight has built more than 400 “smart” courts around the world and this year is set to install more at the US Tennis Association’s new campus near Orlando, Florida.Such courts have high-definition cameras and sensors around them, providing real-time and post-match video data similar to that provided by racket sensors and automated line calling.All this content is uploaded to the “cloud” to be pored over by the players and their coaches.Jolyn de Boer, US Tennis Industry Association executive director, says such technology “is a game-changer for tennis” in helping players to improve and creating an “online community”.People will be able to put their playing data online and find opponents of similar level, she says, thereby creating near-perfect matches.
49;UAA;Under Armour;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Under Armour launches $600m debut bond sale;;As the New York heat draws residents out of the city — to the Soulcycle studio in South Beach and Barry’s Bootcamp outpost in Amagansett — bankers have put on their summer kit to get one fitness group into shape.Under Armour, the fitness apparel maker, has launched the sale of $600m of bonds on Wednesday as it looks to take advantage of the still low borrowing costs, two people familiar with the transaction said.The offering, Under Armour’s first, will mature in 10 years and is set to price with a yield 160 basis points above the benchmark US Treasury, US capital markets correspondent Eric Platt reports.The new corporate paper was set to price tighter than similar dated and rated bonds, which traded on average 188 basis points above the yield on Treasuries, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Yields fall as bond prices rise.The company increased the size of the bond sale from $500m after investor orders hit $8bn, allowing underwriters to cut the company’s borrowing cost. Bankers had initially prepared investors for the bonds to price with a yield roughly 220 basis points above the 10-year Treasury note, which traded at roughly 1.7 per cent in mid-day.Matthew Brill, a portfolio manager with Invesco, said investors were willing to pay up for the sale despite a lacklustre showing from the retail sector this year. While Under Armour shares have fallen 7 per cent this year, sales are projected to climb more than 20 per cent both this and next year — a bright spot in the industry.“This is not your typical investment grade retailer, which are typically slow growth companies generating a lot of cash and mature in their business profile,” he said. “This is a growth company that has the great brand name…Under Armour wants to challenge Nike. They said Nike multiple times during the [investor] call.”Standard & Poor’s rated the new bonds triple B minus, the bottom rung of the investment grade universe. Analysts with the credit rating agency said the triple B minus opinion reflected Under Armour’s “strong market share in the intensely competitive US athletic footwear and apparel industry, history of robust sales and profit growth, and solid credit metrics.”Under Armour plans to use the proceeds to repay a portion of its outstanding revolving credit facility.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo led the offering.
50;UAA;Under Armour;2016-06-02T17:58:40Z;Lululemon: No time to waste;A turnaround at the ‘athleisure’ company is slowly afoot;Chip Wilson famously does not tolerate tardiness. When it comes to Lululemon, the athletic-clothing maker that Mr Wilson founded, the turnaround is too little and too late. An adherent of the Landmark Forum, which promotes “a transparent work environment”, Mr Wilson released a letter ahead of Thursday’s annual shareholder meeting. At a time when fellow upstart Under Armour is surging, the letter said that “management competence is at best uninspiring” . However, Mr Wilson’s missive lacks another cornerstone of Landmark Forum thinking: personal accountability.While Mr Wilson is a revolutionary in the creation of “athleisure” — high performance sportswear that could be worn outside the yoga studio — Lululemon’s weakened fortunes can be traced back to him. In 2013, he blamed defective pants on women whose thighs were too big. A weak apology ìnflamed the public relations crisis and worsened the brand damage.Lululemon then had a supply-chain problem. As sales slowed, excess inventory built up. Discounting to clear the racks and restocking them with new merchandise took time and hurt profits. Revenue growth and margins have not returned to peak levels. Still, a turnaround seems slowly afoot under the management team that Mr Wilson so disparages. Lululemon shares have rallied nearly a tenth in the past year, though they remain well below their 2013 peak.Mr Wilson sold half of his 28 per cent stake to Advent, the private equity firm, in 2014 and resigned his board seat last year (although he does have one board designee). His influence at the company is diminished. Nonetheless, his key tangible demand now — that Lululemon elect its board annually rather than in staggered fashion over three years — is eminently sensible.

I feel strongly that our current Board and management team must clearly articulate and execute a strategy with urgency towards regaining lululemon’s competitive advantage and profitable growth and they must take responsibility.Lululemon created the global athleisure market (which I refer to as “streetnic” — stretch, technical, street — market) and seeded a revolution in the way we all dress. But we are just at the beginning. We cannot continue to cede the market opportunity we created to Under Armour and Nike. The Company’s greatest opportunities are ahead.The founder who maintains that he is the largest shareholder, with a 14.2 per cent stake, said management’s “competence is uninspiring at best”.But Mr Wilson’s criticisms follow upbeat fourth quarter results from Lululemon, which also noted at the time that its inventories “may even begin to look lean”. That has fueled investor optimism with Lululemon shares rising 26 per cent so far this year. The company’s shares were up 2 per cent on Wednesday.Mr Wilson’s open letter follows similar moves by Mr Pulte, founder of homebuilder PulteGroup earlier this year. Mr Pulte had waged a public and vitriolic battle seeking the immediate departure of chief executive Richard Dugas earlier this year.

Operating income for the year is expected to range between $440m to $445m.Kevin Plank, chief executive of Under Armour, said despite the impact to its outlook, the company continues to see growth. He said:While The Sports Authority’s bankruptcy impacts our 2016 outlook, our brand’s momentum is stronger than ever as we continue to see growth and increased demand across all categories and geographies. This one-time event will not impact our focus on making the best decisions for Under Armour through investments that protect and drive our growth.Sports Authority, which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and said it was looking to restructure or sell its business earlier this year, said this month that it is shuttering its stores as the bankruptcy court approved a liquidation.Under Armour shares fell 3.9 per cent in extended trading and are down more than 9 per cent so far this year.

The latest kind to chase their signature are middle-aged lawyers, working for makers of sports kit. This week, Chelsea FC closed in on a £600m kit deal with Nike after ending its previous contract with Adidas. Basketball legend LeBron James has reportedly agreed to his own shoe deal with Nike that is thought be worth $1bn over its life. And upstart Under Armour has hitched its wagon to Stephen Curry, the sharpshooting US hoopster. Team owners have been burnt by overspending for talent in the pursuit of championships. It may be the outfitters’ turn to overextend themselves.The shoe and jersey rivalries resemble another commercial tug of war in sports. Networks, notably Disney’s ESPN, have paid top dollar for television rights for various sports leagues. Live broadcasts are prized by advertisers. Yet ESPN results have suffered in recent quarters as the steep cost of those rights ate into margins and subscribers headed for the exits anyway. The sports gear market may prove healthier, however. Athletic apparel is a rare growth area in retail. There is not yet an analogue to cord-cutting for trainers.Adidas has been struggling for years. But for Nike and Under Armour the scoreboard looks better. In the past three years, shares of the pair are up 170 per cent and 360 per cent respectively. Under Armour was only founded in 1996 and his risen quickly in the US standings. Nike has been able to stay on top because of its wider product assortment, strength globally and strong execution. Its operating margin, at over 15 per cent, is several points higher than Under Armour’s.Yet scrappy underdog Under Armour is pushing Nike hard.

Other foreign internet companies allowed to operate in China, such as LinkedIn, comply with the country’s draconian censorship regime.According to a lawyer involved in the case, the Beijing High Court ruled that the Zhongshan Pearl River Drinks Factory, based in southern Guangdong province, should not have been allowed to register the “face book” trademark in 2014. The factory produces food including potato chips and canned vegetables.Under Chinese law, a multinational with a globally recognised brand must prove that its trademark is also well known within China.Last week a Beijing court ruled that an accessories manufacturer, Xintong Tiandi Technology, was entitled to use the trademark “IPHONE” despite the widespread popularity of Apple’s iPhones. Apple has said that it will appeal against the case in China’s highest court.“If it was illegal for us to register, why were we allowed to do so in the first place?” asked one factory executive, Liu Hongqun, who said he had not received the court’s final ruling. “If Facebook has such an influential brand globally, why can’t Chinese consumers access its website?”Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.Facebook has focused on trying to recruit Chinese advertisers looking to promote their products abroad, rather than luring Chinese users. Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer, said on the first-quarter earnings call that their business selling to marketers in China was “really strong”, giving the example of how Air China used Facebook to advertise new flight routes including one from Mumbai to Beijing.Although Facebook is blocked on the mainland, both it and Mr Zuckerberg are well known in China and internet users there can access the site with the help of technically illegal virtual private networks, or VPNs, which allow them to circumvent the country’s “ Great Firewall”. Other blocked sites, such as Twitter, are also widely used in China via VPNs.In another instance of disputed copycatting, a Chinese athletic clothing company called Uncle Martian has denied mimicking the much better known Under Armour brand, despite having a very similar logo.Additional reporting by Luna Lin and Wan Li in Beijing and Hannah Kuchler in San Francisco
56;UAA;Under Armour;2016-05-04T21:06:00Z;Priceline slides after Easter holiday woe;US stocks dip on all three main indices;Priceline underperformed the broader market on Wednesday after the US online travel agency issued a downbeat profit outlook for the current quarter, citing the timing of the Easter holiday.The Connecticut-based company said it expected to earn profits in the range of $11.60 to $12.50 a share in the current quarter, shy of analysts’ expectations for $14.92 a share.The earlier Easter holiday this year shifted about $40m of gross profit and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation into the first quarter this year, the company said.“I don’t think the deceleration we are pointing to here has really anything to do with competitive factors in the marketplace,” said Jeffery Boyd, interim chief executive, noting the company was “holding or gaining share”.The news came alongside better than expected results in the first three months of the year.Profits rose to $374.4m, or $7.54 a share, in the three months ending in March, up from $333.3m, or $6.42 a share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose 17 per cent to $2.1bn. Analysts were looking for earnings of $7.42 a share, on sales of $2.1bn.Investors, however, soured on the company, sending shares in Priceline, which have slipped 1.7 per cent this year, down 7.5 per cent to $1,253.04, making it the second-biggest decliner on the S&P 500.Priceline’s results come a week after Darren Huston stepped down as chief executive after the company investigated his relationship with an employee who was not under his direct supervision.Priceline’s drop came alongside a sell-off in US equities. At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent to 2,051.1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had slipped 0.6 per cent to 17,651.3, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.8 per cent to 4,725.6.Elsewhere, shares in Time Warner rose 1.5 per cent to $74.80 after the company behind HBO, the Warner Brothers film studio and Turner cable channels reported stronger than expected first-quarter results.Revenues at Time Warner were up 3 per cent to $7.3bn for the three months to the end of March as a surge in advertising sales at the Turner division and strong subscription growth at its news business and HBO offset a weaker performance from its Warner Bros film studio.Profits increased to $1.2bn, or $1.51 a share, from $970m, or $1.15 a share, in the same period a year ago.CBS shares advanced 1.6 per cent to $56.53, after the company said revenues grew 10 per cent to $3.85bn in the three months ended in March, driven by a jump in advertising revenues.Meanwhile, profits rose to $473m, or $1.03 a share, compared with $394m, or 79 cents a share, in the year-ago period, ahead of analysts’ expectations.Both companies showed that advertising revenues were returning to television, rising 31 per cent at CBS and 5 per cent at Time Warner’s Turner division.Under Armour shares fell 7.7 per cent to $39.46, after the athletic apparel maker said two senior executives were leaving the company.The Baltimore-based group said Robin Thurston, chief digital officer, and Henry Stafford, chief merchandising officer, would exit in July.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
57;UAA;Under Armour;2016-04-21T20:53:57Z;Under Armour surges on basketball success;Popularity of NBA star Stephen Curry’s shoe line boosts first-quarter results for sportswear maker;Under Armour was among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500 on Thursday after the sportswear maker said the popularity of NBA star Stephen Curry’s basketball shoe line boosted first-quarter results.Shares in the retailer advanced 6.8 per cent to $46.94 after the company said footwear net revenues jumped 64 per cent in the quarter to $264m, reflecting the success of Mr Curry’s basketball line and its expanded running shoe range.The news came alongside profits of $19.2m, or 4 cents a share, in the three months ended in March, up from $11.7m, or 3 cents a share, in the year-before quarter. Sales rose 30 per cent to $1.05bn. Analysts were expecting earnings of 2 cents a share on sales of $1.04bn.Under Armour’s success comes at a difficult time for speciality sports retailers, with US-based Sports Authority filing for bankruptcy protection this year following City Sports, which filed for bankruptcy in October.“Despite some concerns over the footwear category, as flagged by Nike earlier in the year, and exacerbated by the bankruptcy of Sports Authority, Under Armour’s sales growth is not wavering,” said Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities. Its shares have advanced nearly 34 per cent since the beginning of last year.Under Armour’s gain came on a day when the market broadly retreated. At the close the S&P 500 had fallen 0.5 per cent to 2,091.5, the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 0.6 per cent to 17,982.5, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.1 per cent to 4,945.9.Telecommunications was the worst performing sector in the benchmark S&P 500, falling 2.7 per cent, with Verizon Communications a big faller after warning that a strike by workers could weigh on current quarter earnings. Verizon fell 3.3 per cent to $50.04.The shares of United Continental declined after a gloomy sales outlook for the current quarter overshadowed stronger than expected quarterly profits.The US airline said its first-quarter net income fell to $313m from $508m in the same three-month period in 2015. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items, of $1.23 a share beat Wall Street estimates of $1.18 a share. Revenues declined 4.8 per cent to $8.2bn, matching estimates.However, the Chicago-based group said it expected its passenger revenue per available seat mile, a closely watched sales metric in the airline industry, to fall 6.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent year-on-year in the current quarter, after a sharp slide in the first.The guidance was “not good”, according to Joseph DeNardi, a Stifel analyst, who added that “we now have much less confidence assuming an improvement in [passenger revenue per available seat mile] through the year”.United’s shares dropped 10 per cent in their biggest intraday decline since May 2015 to $52.74, extending their fall over the past 12 months to 17.6 per cent. The shares of other airlines also slid: Delta Air Lines dropped 3.5 per cent to $44.98 and American Airlines slipped 3 per cent to $40.01.Shares in Mattel declined 5.8 per cent to $31.13 after the toymaker logged a deeper than expected quarterly loss and its Barbie sales were hit by a stronger dollar.Mattel said sales of its Barbie dolls fell 3 per cent and were flat when adjusted for currency fluctuations.
58;UAA;Under Armour;2016-04-04T13:42:03Z;Connected scales can help you lose weight;Software may provide a more accurate picture than wearables when it comes to cutting calories;Sales of fitness trackers are booming, with buyers saying that losing weight is one of their main goals.When these devices were tested by researchers, however, questions were raised about the validity of the record of calories burnt. With errors of up to 400 calories a day, it can be difficult to figure out a way to shed pounds.Luckily, there are better ways to lose weight. Several companies have introduced electronic scales that connect to the internet and integrate with software, providing you with a more accurate picture of your current situation and what to do to achieve your goals.Recently I have been trying two products: the Polar Balance, a $99.95 smart scale from the Finnish sports fitness company, and the Under Armour HealthBox, a $400 package from the American sports clothing manufacturer, which includes a scale, heart rate monitor and fitness band.Most electronic scales use WiFi to link to the internet, but the Polar Balance connects via Bluetooth with a Polar fitness tracker or watch.It measures only weight but the data integrate nicely with the Polar Balance app, which is available on the web, or the Polar Flow app for your iPhone or Android device.Using your height, weight and workout history, Polar’s software produces feedback on your eating and activity levels, and suggests the best way to reach your target.For example, it might tell you to cut 200 calories from your food intake and add a 20-minute jog or a one-hour walk.The Under Armour package goes several steps further. The Under Armour scale links to the internet by WiFi and shows not only your weight but an estimate of your body fat, which I found to be very accurate when I compared it by using the scientific approach of skin calipers.One benefit of having an estimate of your body fat is that you know your lean mass — the weight of your muscles and organs — and can calculate how many calories you really need.Under Armour has recently acquired a number of fitness apps that, when combined with the HealthBox, make losing weight much easier.My favourite is MyFitnessPal, a food and exercise diary that calculates how many calories you have eaten and estimates how many calories you have burnt.The app uses a database of 5m foods, so it is easy to keep track of the calories you take in each day.While the estimate of calories burnt on MyFitnessPal is probably no more accurate than those of other fitness trackers, the key is that your workout is integrated daily with measurements of your weight and body fat from the Under Armour scale.All of this information comes together in the Under Armour Record app, which is available free for both Apple iOS and Android phones, keeping track of sleep (using the Under Armour wrist tracker), workout activity and calories eaten.The benefit of all this data collection is that research shows that people who keep a record of food intake lose twice as much weight as those who do not.The reason that these trackers work is that it soon becomes obvious where the unnecessary calories are coming from.Once you cut them out, you instantly see the benefit at your morning weigh-in.fitexecutive@ft.com

On a currency-neutral basis, sales advanced 14 per cent.Nike also said it expects its revenues to rise at a “high single-digit rate” in the fiscal year to May 2017, which is on the “conservative” end of the spectrum, said UBS analyst Michael Binetti. Analysts were looking for fiscal 2017 sales growth of about 10 per cent.In a silver lining, Nike’s quarterly profits climbed to $950m, or 55 cents a share, from $791m, or 45 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Analysts expected profits of 49 cents.Nike’s shares, which surged by almost a third in 2015, fell 3.8 per cent on Tuesday to $62.45, leaving them roughly flat for the year.Shares of Under Armour, which competes in the same industry, fell 1.8 per cent to $82.90.Elsewhere, the S&P 500 energy sector dropped 2.1 per cent, making it by far the biggest laggard of the main indices, amid a decline in the price of oil.US crude fell 4 per cent to $39.79 after the energy department said American oil inventories rose far more than expected last week.The news was the latest reminder that the global supply glut persists despite the stabilisation in oil prices.Marathon Oil, an exploration and production company, dropped 9.9 per cent to $10.19. Chevron, an oil major, declined 2 per cent to $93.61.Miners also came under pressure as the price of copper, aluminium and gold all declined.Freeport-McMoRan, a copper miner, dropped 11.3 per cent to $9.75. Meanwhile, aluminium maker Alcoa declined 5.3 per cent to $9.33.Krispy Kreme Doughnuts fell after revealing a disappointing profit outlook for the current fiscal year.The chain said it expects to post adjusted profits of 87 cents — 91 cents per share in fiscal 2017, compared with expectations of 92 cents.The shares fell 7 per cent to $14.29. They have dropped 30 per cent over the past 12 months.The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent to 2,036.71, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 per cent to 17,502.59 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.1 per cent lower at 4,768.86.In addition to energy and materials, the financial, healthcare and consumer discretionary sectors all logged solid losses. The utilities and consumer staples sectors, both seen as defensive holdings, were the only advancers.US stocks have seemingly run out of steam after five straight weeks of gains that have lifted the S&P 500 about 11 per cent from its lows of the year.The broad-market barometer is now essentially unchanged for 2016 but market strategists warn of a potential flare-up in volatility as first-quarter earnings season kicks off in mid-April.

61;UAA;Under Armour;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Why NBA star Curry frightens Under Armour bears;;Investors don’t like having things out of their control, but in the case of sportswear maker, Under Armour, they do. And he’s one of the brightest stars in the NBA.Stephen Curry, who helped the Golden State Warriors to the NBA championship last season and endorses Under Armour’s brand of sneakers, is the single biggest threat to anyone betting on a decline in the company’s stock, according to a new report from Morgan Stanley.Analysts at Morgan Stanley note that Under Armour is losing share of the apparel market for the first time in three years. Moreover, the average selling price (ASP) of its footwear has fallen 23 per cent over the last two years, compared with just four per cent for the industry, it argues. Jay Sole, an analyst with the investment bank, says:UA has always competed on brand image and innovation, rarely on price. Footwear sales are growing strongly, but ASPs are falling. This change in trend is a concern because it suggests a fundamental shift in the UA story.Those concerns have left Morgan Stanley as the only Wall Street shop with a “sell” rating on a stock that has rocketed more than tenfold since 2010. Its target price for the shares is $64, about 24 per cent lower than the current price.But Mr Curry, the NBA’s reigning MVP and frontrunner for the award so far this season, could leave Mr Cole shaking in his boots. The analyst notes:UA’s US basketball shoe sales have increased over 350% YTD. Its Stephen Curry signature shoe business is already bigger than those of LeBron, Kobe, and every other player except Michael Jordan. If Curry is the next Jordan, our call will likely be wrong.If Mr Curry maintains his current performance, Under Armour’s basketball footwear sales can grow at 60 per cent a year for the next three, Morgan Stanley reckons, as people buy the player as much as the brand.And should the Golden Warrior’s appeal prove strong enough it could have knock-on effects on Under Armour’s apparel and running shoes businesses, too, according to Morgan Stanley, which reckons in that scenario the shares could surge 52 per cent to $127.50.
62;UAA;Under Armour;2016-03-03T12:39:41Z;Adidas: go-faster stripes;Improving margins is top of the new CEO’s in-tray. But how best to do it?;"The margin between victory and defeat on the sports field is often narrow. For German sportswear group Adidas, narrow margins are a problem off the field, too. Back in 2010, its business plan called for operating margins of 11 per cent by 2015. Full-year results published on Thursday showed them at 6.5 per cent. Kasper Rorsted, who takes over as chief executive this year, has plenty to do.An obvious first move would be to sell the golf division, TaylorMade adidas-Golf, where sales fell 13 per cent (at unchanged exchanges rates) during 2015. Its future is already under review; based on the valuation of US-listed Callaway, TaylorMade could fetch perhaps €800m. However, while there are plenty of valid reasons to sell TaylorMade, it is only 5 per cent of sales so the effect of a disposal on margins would be limited. Selling Reebok, another underperformer, would have more impact but Reebok’s sales and profits are at least growing and it is more integral to the group.More durable results would come from cutting running costs. Gross margins at Adidas are similar to US rivals but at the operating level margins are lower. Assuming that its higher marketing spend (14 per cent of sales) is sacrosanct, that leaves about €4.9bn of other costs. Adidas says they will fall this year. They need to: they were 29 per cent of sales in 2015, compared with 22 per cent at Nike.Another long-term problem lurks in Mr Rorsted’s in-tray: North America. The rate of sales growth there last year was half that of Latin America and a third of European and Chinese levels. Profit fell two-fifths and Adidas has lost its number two spot in the US, the world’s biggest market, to Under Armour.The bad news is that the sheer size of the US market means Adidas would need to take a lot of market share in places such as China to offset continued attrition in the US. The good news is that operational gearing means small improvements in sales there would provide a strong boost to profit.Mr Rorsted’s labours will be made easier by Adidas’s forecast 10-12 per cent sales growth this year (helped by major sporting events). But his record has not gone unnoticed. Since his appointment was announced, Adidas shares have risen 18 per cent, beating the Dax, and the valuation gap with Nike has narrowed. Two activist investors have been given supervisory board seats. No pressure, then.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
63;UAA;Under Armour;2016-01-28T20:33:39Z;Stephen Curry helps Under Armour to 4th best day;;Under Armour shares are poised for their fourth best day on record thanks in part to demand for NBA star Stephen Curry’s footwear line.Shares in the athletic clothing company soared 22.3 per cent to $83.87 on Thursday, propelled by better-than-expected fourth quarter results and a rosy sales outlook for this year.The Baltimore-based company said profits climbed 20 per cent to $105.6m or 48 cents a share, while sales jumped 31 per cent to $1.2bn in the final three months of the year, ahead of Wall Street’s forecasts. Revenues were driven by a jump in footwear sales, specifically its Stephen Curry basketball sneakers.Shares in the retailer, which has benefited from consumers increasing habit of wearing sports fashions outside the gym, are up more than 2000 per cent since the company went public in 2005.
64;UAA;Under Armour;2016-01-15T11:14:00Z;Lululemon: resetting the pace;An admirable turnround at the yoga pants maker;A yoga class is just the thing for the rattled psyches of the world’s money managers. Lululemon announced strong holiday sales this week and boosted targets for the next quarter. Its shares jumped 4 per cent on an otherwise ugly day. Fitness fanaticism — or at least weekend warriors’ need to dress the part — is also helping results at Nike (up 26 per cent in the past year) and Under Armour (7 per cent).Apart from the spandex peddlers, US retail is mostly grim. But Lululemon is not just benefiting from a trend. It has performed a rare feat in managing to reset the expectations of bruised investors, and then hit them.Lululemon said fourth-quarter revenue would come in slighter higher than its previous forecast. It also said profit margins would remain strong, a crucial point. Disappointing sales can cascade into bloated inventory that ties up cash and forces discounting to pull customers into shops and empty the storerooms.While the results are encouraging, the company is not nearly as fit as it was before the see-through pants crisis of 2013. Like-for-like sales, even after the rebound, are forecast to be in the high single-digits, half what they were. Its operating margin goal of 20 per cent is well below the 25 per cent achieved in 2013. The clearest indication of its shrunken ambitions is its share, off a third from its peak.Still, arresting a decline and starting a turnround are achievements not to be mocked in retail. Many consumer brands flounder, lose their appeal and are never heard from again. Another, more modest example of a revival of this is the low-end department store chain JC Penney, once on the verge of bankruptcy, which also reported a solid holiday season. For the current crop of adrift merchants — most prominently JC Penney’s slightly more upscale rival Macy’s — there is reason to be hopeful, if they can offer products customers want and manage investors’ expectations carefully.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

It also said it expected 2016 adjusted earnings of $5.50 to $5.70 a share, compared with analysts’ estimates of $5.67 a share.The shares dropped 5.46 per cent to $103.03.Under Armour came under pressure after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut the stock to “underweight” from “equal-weight”.The analysts said the sportswear company was “losing market share for the first time in three years in apparel, and more surprisingly, [average sales prices] are falling at an accelerating pace”.The shares slid 6.72 per cent to $69.96, cutting their 12-month gain to about 3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan dropped as copper prices sold off by more than 2 per cent. The company’s credit rating was cut by Fitch Ratings after the market closed on Friday to triple B minus, from triple B.The rating agency said the move reflected its view that the “commodity prices recovery will be prolonged”.Freeport is one of the world’s biggest copper miners and has taken a beating as the price of the industrial metal has fallen by more than a quarter in the past 12 months.Its shares fell 20.33 per cent to $4.31, extending their decline over the past year to 80 per cent.Many energy companies came under pressure amid a sharp decline in the price of crude oil. Marathon Oil, an exploration and production company, dropped 7.05 per cent to $9.62 a share.Meanwhile, Williams Companies, an energy infrastructure company, fell 7.98 per cent to $18.69.General Motors shares rose after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “neutral”.The investment bank said worries that the global automotive cycle had peaked after a blistering year for sales were “overstated in the near-term”.The US carmaker’s shares climbed 2.44 per cent to $30.25. They were down about 16 per cent over the past 12 months.By the close, the S&P 500 had nudged up to 1,923.42, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up around 0.3 per cent to 16,397.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was about 0.1 per cent down at 4,637.63.
66;UAA;Under Armour;2016-01-11T21:45:19Z;"Lululemon has strong holiday sales; shares jump";;"Perhaps it’s consumers preparing to shed holiday weight that helped yoga-wear maker Lululemon raise its outlook for the fourth quarter.Shares in Lululemon jumped nearly 8 per cent to $58.99 in after market trading on Monday, after the Vancouver-based company said sales in the quarter running to the end of January are “exceeding expectations”.The retailer now expects fourth-quarter sales in the range of $690m to $695m, up 15 per cent from the year ago period. That’s up from earlier guidance of $670m to $685m. It also eclipsed Wall Street forecasts of $679.3m.Lululemon also raised its profit forecast to between 78 to 80 cents a share, topping analysts’ forecasts for 77 cents a share. Laurent Potdevin, chief executive, said:We had a very successful holiday season driven by strong execution in stores
and online during the key holiday weeks. Sales for the fourth quarter are
exceeding expectations and gross margin rates and expenses remain in line with
prior guidance.Lululemon has staged some recovery from a 2013 recall of its signature yoga pants that were too sheer. The retailer, along with companies like Nike and Under Armour, has benefited from the athleisure trend in which people increasingly wear sports gear outside the gym.Lululemon shares declined 6 per cent last year."
67;UAA;Under Armour;2016-01-05T16:31:38Z;CES 2016: Fitbit launches latest fitness-focused smartwatch;Leader in wearable technology looks to new products to head off non-traditional rivals;Fitbit launched a new fitness-focused smartwatch at the Consumer Electronics Show on Tuesday, as looks to stave off growing competition to its early lead in wearable technology from beyond Silicon Valley.The Blaze smartwatch will go on sale in March, starting at $199 — just over half the price of the cheapest Apple Watch at $350.The latest addition to Fitbit’s product range, which runs from the $60 Zip to the $250 Surge GPS watch, will include features such a colour touchscreen, continuous heart-rate monitoring and alerts of incoming calls and texts from a paired smartphone.After revealing its first new device since going public last June, Fitbit closed 18 per cent lower at $24.27, its lowest point after the initial public offering.The launch comes as CES sees a swath of companies from outside of the traditional tech sector looking to challenge Fitbit’s dominance of the wearable tech market.Watchmaker Fossil said on Tuesday it would launch more than 100 smartwatches and fitness trackers this year, while sportswear brand Under Armour and smartphone maker HTC jointly launched a suite of health-monitoring devices called Healthbox.Beyond the new features for the Blaze, Fitbit is taking a new approach to product design to help it fend off the competition. The main sensor and display of the Blaze can easily be swapped between a range of bands and casings, from leather straps to steel link bracelets. Fitbit’s partnership with Tory Burch, the fashion designer, will be extended to include the new device.The launch is an acknowledgment that how wearable technology looks, as well as what it does, is increasingly essential if device makers want to reach the mass market.“Whereas with [Fitbit’s other wristbands] Charge HR and Surge, it was really a ‘one size fits all’ on the look, there’s going to be a heavy focus on personalisation and accessories with Blaze,” said James Park, Fitbit chief executive.Wearable technology is in focus at this year’s CES despite lingering questions about the breadth of smartwatches’ appeal.The Consumer Technology Association, which hosts CES, said on Monday that unit sales of fitness trackers were expected to rise just 12 per cent this year, with smartwatches up by a fifth. Those are relatively modest growth rates compared with other new technologies such as drones and virtual reality.“People have struggled with what the killer app is for smartwatches. For us it’s health and fitness,” says Mr Park, taking a swipe at the complexity of using Apple Watch, Fitbit’s nearest rival in terms of unit sales.“It’s really cumbersome on the Apple Watch sometimes to see what is my daily activity because they are trying to do so many things.”Unlike the iPhone maker, Fitbit is not offering an array of third-party apps for its smartwatch.“What are the things that people use the most [on smartwatches]? It’s time, notifications, health and fitness, then everything else is kind of noise,” Mr Park says. “Those are the three things we’ve focused on nailing in this product.”Mr Park would not comment directly on how well Fitbits had sold over the holiday period, but one positive indicator was that its iPhone app topped the App Store’s download charts immediately after Christmas. That would suggest a large number of new customers were setting up their wristbands for the first time.While Fitbit has become synonymous with health tracking technology, its success has inspired competition from all sides.In 2013, Under Armour spent hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire health apps My Fitness Pal, Endomondo and Map My Fitness. Healthbox, a $400 health-tracking kit that includes a wristband, internet-connected weighing scales and a heart-monitoring chest strap, will be released later this month.There are also signs that traditional watchmakers are starting to feel the competitive pressure.Fossil’s watch business has declined in the last three quarters as Apple, Fitbit and Samsung launch more wrist devices.Five years ago the company pulled sales of an early range of connected watches amid lacklustre sales. But in November, Fossil acquired Misfit, a Fitbit rival, for $260m and Greg McKelvey, chief strategy and digital officer, says its latest fitness trackers and smartwatches that run Google’s Android Wear software are seeing much greater demand.“We’ve broken the divide between fashion and technology and are in a position to start leading the convergence,” he says.This year, Fossil will release app-connected watches through its own brand, as well as under licence with fashion labels including Michael Kors, its top seller, and Emporio Armani.“In 2016 we are going to be shooting for numbers that are definitely not in the hundreds of thousands,” says Mr McKelvey. “We are going big in 2016.” He predicts that those sales will be complementary to sales of its traditional watches by appealing to more fashion-conscious consumers than tech companies can.Despite the new entrants, Mr Park at Fitbit is confident that the company can withstand another wave of rivals.“Last year there were a tonne of wrist wearables on the floor [at CES],” he says. “At some point, a lot of these companies are investing significant amounts of money launching these wearable products without getting a lot of market traction. I’m curious to how long that can go on.”

It is Fitbit’s first new product since the Charge HR and Surge wristbands launched more than a year ago, writes Tim Bradshaw in Las Vegas.As well as new features such as a colour touchscreen, continuous heart-rate monitoring and alerts of incoming calls and texts from a paired smartphone, Fitbit is taking a new approach to product design with Blaze.Its main sensor and display can easily be swapped between a range of bands and casings, from leather straps to steel link bracelets.“We’ve made it more stylish,” said James Park, Fitbit’s chief executive. “Whereas with Charge HR and Surge, it was really a ‘one size fits all’ on the look, there’s going to be a heavy focus on personalisation and accessories with Blaze.”

It’ll be interesting to see what happens over the next year or two.”"

Like smaller rivals such as Under Armour, Nike’s domestic performance is benefitting from consumers’ increasing habit of wearing sports fashions outside the gym.Analysts at Jefferies said of Nike’s quarterly results that it:Again delivered ahead of expectations, the results of which speak to the brand’s power and market positioning even amidst a challenging environment.Nike said that orders for the next four months were up 20 per cent, signalling its robust run will continue.

The shares, which were already down 38 per cent this year, fell 14 per cent to $40.41.“The department store sector has come under significant pressure in recent weeks as a number of brands commented on weakness in the US wholesale channel and elevated inventory levels driving a promotional acceleration,” said Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.The extent of the hit to sentiment was underlined by the performance of JCPenney, another veteran department store, whose shares began the day brightly after it said same-store sales in the third quarter had climbed a larger than expected 6.4 per cent.Its stock rose as much as 2.3 per cent to $8.88. But the move quickly unravelled after Macy’s results, which pushed the shares down 2 per cent to $8.51.JCPenney said it would pay as much as $50m to settle a lawsuit by customers in California over pricing. Although it denies the allegation that it broke Californian state law, the retailer said it was settling to avoid a protracted legal battle.The S&P 500 Consumer Durables and Apparel index, a broad measure of US retailers that includes Under Armour and Ralph Lauren, dropped 1.6 per cent, making it the second-worst performer on the S&P 500.Pharmaceuticals were also in focus. Shares in Horizon Pharma plunged 19.6 per cent to $17.99 after Express Scripts, which manages drug programmes for insurers and is a force in US healthcare, said it was suing the company and severing ties with pharmacy chain Linden Care, which dispenses Horizon’s products.Speciality pharmacies, which exclusively or predominantly sell medicines made by a single company, have been hit by concerns about some drug companies’ business models. Horizon said Express’s suit was without merit.In oil and gas, Apache shares fell 7.4 per cent to $49.38 after Anadarko Petroleum confirmed that it had made an approach. Anadarko added that it had withdrawn the bid. Energy companies are struggling to agree deals despite the pressure for consolidation.Some sectors fared better. The S&P 500 homebuilding index rose 1.9 per cent after surging 5.4 per cent on Tuesday. Results from DR Horton, one of the largest US homebuilders, buoyed sentiment after its profits rose more than expected.

A combination of a deepening recession in Brazil, alongside a steady US recovery, has left the real as the worst performing big emerging market currency against the greenback this year. Brazil accounted for 24 per cent of the company’s total revenues last year.“[A] A weak crop protection pricing environment in Brazil is a key additional risk for FMC that could be a source of more downside in coming quarters,” Aleksey Yefremov, an analyst at Nomura, said.The Philadelphia-based company lowered its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to $2.35-$2.45 a share, below its previous forecast for earnings of $3-$3.30 a share. This missed analysts’ estimates for earnings of $3.02 a share.FMC also announced between 800-850 job cuts that would help reduce costs by $140m to $160m a year.“The steps we are announcing today will protect the profitability of the business during this downturn, shrink the capital employed in the region and position FMC to take advantage of a future market recovery,” Pierre Brondeau, chief executive, said.Shares, which have declined nearly 36 per cent this year, fell 3 per cent to $36.35.Shares of US carrier JetBlue Airways fell nearly 8 per cent to $24.75, after analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “overweight” and lowered their price target by a dollar to $27. “JetBlue shares no longer provide the level of upside potential we once envisioned,” Jamie Baker, an analyst at JPMorgan, said.The New York based company said late on Monday that preliminary passenger revenue per available seat mile, a key industry metric, climbed 1 per cent in September from the previous year.Under Armour shares fell 2 per cent to $101.28 after the company said Brad Dickerson, the company’s chief financial officer and chief operating officer, would leave the company in early 2016 to pursue an opportunity outside of the athletic performance industry.

73;UAA;Under Armour;2015-09-18T16:45:50Z;McIlroy and Spieth lead golf’s young pretenders;New prodigies have kept interest among fans and advertisers alive;“How did you do that?” Rory McIlroy asked Tiger Woods, as the pair traded shots on the range. “You’ll learn,’’ replied Woods, fully embracing the role of wise elder.The setting was not a major championship or a PGA Tour event, but a Nike advertisement that aired after the sports­wear company had signed McIlroy to a multimillion-dollar contract in 2013. The subtext was clear enough: the mantle of “greatest golfer in the world” was being passed to a young pretender, and a new era had begun.At the launch announcement in Abu Dhabi, Nike’s then president Cindy Davis talked of McIlroy’s ability to “connect with fans everywhere”. The message appeared to be that, if golf had a new superstar, he’d still be wearing Nike’s famous Swoosh logo.Sport rarely fits the marketing industry’s need for certainty, however, and since then another player has emerged to challenge the Northern Irishman’s place at the top of the world rankings.On the same day as Nike’s Abu Dhabi launch, its sports brand rival Under Armour told the trade press it had signed the promising 19-year-old college player Jordan Spieth to wear its range of golf clothing, a business generating sales in the region of $100m a year at that point.Kevin Plank, Under Armour’s founder, admitted that McIlroy had been his first choice and that he tried to pull together a deal that would see him wearing his clothing as he played with the Titleist brand of clubs. At the start of this year, Under Armour cemented its relationship with Spieth with a 10-year deal that assures no other company logo appears on the player’s clothing until after the 2025 season.The logos of Spieth’s roster of other sponsors — AT&T, Rolex, Perfect Sense Digital, NetJets and SuperStroke Grips — are nowhere to be seen. For golf club maker Titleist, he wears a branded glove. This leaves plenty of room for the distinctive UA badge. As he walked the fairways of St Andrews at this year’s British Open, brand-aware TV viewers could have counted 16 Under Armour logos on the player’s wiry frame.The subtext below the frenzied marketing activity is of a sport desperate to promote itself to people of Spieth and McIlroy’s age. Participation numbers have fallen sharply among the so-called millennial generation of 20-somethings. The industry’s plan is clear, if a little simplistic. If golf can produce telegenic young stars, it will encourage younger viewers to take up the game.The two players have kept their side of the bargain. Spieth and McIlroy have won four of the last six major championships — the ultimate barometer of an elite golfer’s pedigree.When 39-year-old Zach Johnson won the Open Championship at St Andrews in July, it ended Spieth’s hopes of winning the Grand Slam of all four majors in a calendar year, having already won The Masters and the US Open. The disappointment in the coverage was palpable: Johnson’s win had spoilt the bigger story.Amid the excitement, the players at least are keeping a sense of historical perspective.McIlroy said before the US PGA Championship in August: “Everything happens so quickly that a year ago . . . it was the Rory Era — and then Jordan [Spieth] wins the Masters and it’s the Jordan Era. Eras last about six months these days, instead of 20 years”.It remains to be seen whether any of the current crop of stars will inherit the mantle of Tiger Woods, either as a player or a salesman. The 39-year-old’s relatively poor recent form belies a player who has won 14 major championships since his emergence in 1996.Just as McIlory and Spieth are tasked with reaching millennials, so Woods was heralded as golf’s Trojan horse into non-traditional golf markets.His first major win at The Masters in Augusta in 1997 was not only brilliant, it was also so “on-brand” for Nike — the black kid won the title at a place where his skin colour would have prevented him playing until 1975 and it was compulsory to have a black caddie until 1983.Woods’ Masters victory came just six years after the club admitted its first black member. Yet the USPGA’s figures on golf participation among ethnic minorities shows that Woods’ legacy in this area has been negligible.Ted Bishop, president of the PGA of America, says: “You really haven’t seen any increase in diversity participation since [Woods] came to the forefront, which is really disconcerting.”Such facts won’t deter the sports marketing industry from investing in heroes, of which there is a steady supply. Jason Day won the USPGA Championship, the final major of the year. Like McIlroy and Spieth he is telegenic, articulate and in his 20s.“For young guys such as me and Jordan and Rickie Fowler (26) and Hideki Matsuyama (23), a lot of those guys are starting to play better golf and starting to challenge,” says Day.“It’s going to be a lot of fun over the next five to 10 years.”A whole industry is hoping he is right.A plot of 200 golfers’ driving ability, using 2015 PGA tour data, shows Rory McIlroy’s strength off the tee.The Irishman gains a big advantage by being both straight and long with his first strike.Jason Day of Australia hits further if less accurately.Jordan Spieth’s drives lack length but the American’s forte comes later in his chipping and putting, as he gains his edge on and around the greens.All three share one key quality: their success is vital for golf marketing’s longer game.Source: PGATour.com — measuring average length in yards and accuracy off the tee
74;UAA;Under Armour;2015-07-14T13:46:03Z;Copenhagen: A strong start-up community but high taxes;Three universities mean a large potential workforce, but entrepreneurs must look abroad for scale;"Copenhagen population 1.2m
Denmark population 5.6m
Tech start-ups 430
Copenhagen university population: 94,000Mary Meeker, a partner at Silicon Valley VC firm Kleiner Perkins, said in 2012 that the rising number of tech start-ups was partly driven by a desperate “what have I got to lose” mentality. The burgeoning start-up scene in Copenhagen must be the exception to that rule, with people more likely to be happy than desperate. Denmark came third in the UN’s World Happiness Report this year, down from first place.The case for: With three big universities the port city is home to a bright workforce. Once isolated in basements and garages, would-be entrepreneurs are forming a strong community that is supported and cheered on by a grassroots movement known by a hashtag — #CPHFTW. Copenhagen, For The Win is an organisation funded by start-ups to help promote and foster a culture and community.Denmark has low levels of inequality by the standards of the developed world. In turn, the taxes support a generous social system, which entrepreneurs say means the fear of unemployment or financial failure is lower than it might be elsewhere.Denmark has near 100 per cent internet penetration and technology is advanced.“It’s very easy to set up a company in Denmark. You can do it in hours,” said Kris Ostergaard, co-founder of the accelerator Thinkubator and the incubator Dare2Mansion.The case against: The state takes an ample share of the financial rewards for founding a successful start-up. Capital gains tax is 27 per cent up to DKK 48,300 ($7,160) and 42 per cent on gains above that. Denmark also has one of the highest income tax rates in the world, at up to 57 per cent. And the small home market limits the scalability of businesses unless they look abroad.“Investors are very conservative,” said Anders Ibsen, the Copenhagen entrepreneur whose latest venture is Conyak, the mobile advertising platform. “It’s hard to raise money in Denmark. Even the VCs are risk averse. Many of them have not been entrepreneurs so they don’t buy in on the vision but the business model plus, simply, there is less money.”Local heroes: Morten Lund is a serial investor. He was an early investor in Skype and the digital invoicing company Tradeshift.Trust Pilot is an online shopping review website, which raised $74m in May.Endomondo is a fitness tracking app, and was bought by US sportswear business Under Armour for $85m in February.Newer start-ups include Conyak, formed last year, and Be My Eyes, a smartphone app that connects visually impaired users with sighted helpers. BME came out of the Thinkubator accelerator last year and was downloaded more than 250,000 times in three months. Local giants include Maersk, Lego and Carlsberg.Support for start-ups: While there is less support for early stage business, there is support from #CPHFTW and co-working spaces such as Founders House, Rocket Labs, Rainmaking Loft and Dare2Mansion.

By close, Humana had taken the top spot with a 3.38 per cent fall.Shares of United Rentals, which have declined almost 16 per cent in the past year, fell more than 3 per cent to $87.93 in morning trading. The stock recovered to close at $88.79.The Stamford, Connecticut company is expected to experience lower levels of activity in the future, but projects under construction will continue in the near term, said Sameer Rathod, an analyst at Macquarie.United Rentals lowered its 2015 rental rate to 3 per cent, from its previous outlook for a 3.5 per cent year-on-year increase in April and maintained its utilisation rate, a measure of the time that equipment is rented, at 69 per cent.Mr Rathod said several engineering and construction companies have noted delays in projects in response to the decline in oil prices, which could hurt demand as projects wrap up and no new work begins. In turn he expects the company will have to cut its rental rate and utilisation guidance in the second or third quarter.Gap shares advanced 1.44 per cent to $38.75 after the retailer announced late on Monday that it would close about 175 of its namesake stores in North America over the next few years as it seeks to boost profitability at its Gap brand.About 140 of the closures are expected this fiscal year and will not affect Gap Outlet and Gap Factory stores. Gap also plans to shut some of its European stores.The San Francisco company said it would also cut staff by 250 at its headquarters, primarily in North America.Gap said it expected to save $25m a year starting in 2016 from the restructuring, although the store closures are projected to cut $300m from sales. It reaffirmed its full-year outlook for earnings to range between $2.75 and $2.80 a share.Under Armour shares advanced nearly 2 per cent to $82.78, after the retailer said it would create a new class of stock in an attempt to maintain the influence of Kevin Plank, its founder and chief executive.Shares of Aerie Pharmaceuticals jumped 50.3 per cent to $19.94 after the US Food and Drug Administration allowed the company to shift the goalposts in a trial to test its Rhopressa eyedrop.The stock was also buoyed after analysts at Needham upgraded it to “buy” from “hold” with a $27 price target.US stocks edged higher as Federal Reserve policy makers began a two-day monetary policy setting meeting on Tuesday.By close of trading on Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.57 per cent to 2,096.37, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 17,903.98.

76;UAA;Under Armour;2015-06-05T20:59:18Z;Under Armour among S&P 500 leaders after upgrade;Diamond Foods tops profit estimates and raises outlook;Investors shopped for shares of Under Armour, after the athletic-apparel maker’s prospects attracted another bullish rating from a Wall Street brokerage.The number of Under Armour bulls swelled to 18, after DA Davidson upgraded the stock from “neutral” to “buy” and maintained its $91 price target, after the close on Thursday.Andrew Burns, an analyst at DA Davidson, said that Under Armour shares sold off following first-quarter results but he expected upward revisions during the second half of the year.Mr Burns said that after years of investing in footwear and international growth, “these initiatives are taking root”.He added: “We believe this is symbolic of an inflection point in Under Armour’s growth formula. Under Armour’s growth drivers will shift towards the vast opportunities in the footwear category, outside of the US, and continued US distribution improvements (outdoor, department store, athletic footwear retailers).”The retailer has also benefited from its athlete-sponsorship strategy, with athletes such as Tom Brady, Jordan Spieth and Stephen Curry.Shares of Under Armour, which have advanced 44 per cent in the past year, rose 4.87 per cent to $81.84 and were among the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500.Shares of Diamond Foods, the packaged-foods maker behind brands such as Kettle chips and Emerald nuts, rallied 7.39 per cent to $31.11, after the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ forecasts and lifted its full-year guidance.The San Francisco-based company reported profits of $6.3m or 20 cents a share, compared with a loss in the prior-year period. Sales, however, declined 2.5 per cent to $186.1m.Analysts had forecast earnings of 15 cents a share, on sales of $195.3m.The company said it now expected full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $1 to $1.10 a share, compared with its previous forecast for 95 cents to $1.10 a share. Analysts forecast earnings of $1.04 a share.Shares of Zumiez fell 19.30 per cent to $24, after the teen apparel and athletic wear retailer issued a disappointing outlook for the current quarter.The company said it expected earnings in the range of 12-15 cents a share, including charges in association with the acquisition of Blue Tomato, missing Wall Street forecasts for earnings of 30 cents a share.Zumiez expects sales in the range of $179m to $183m, below forecasts for $193m, and said same-store sales, a key industry metric, were projected to decline 3-5 per cent.The guidance came alongside first-quarter earnings that were in line with estimates and sales that topped forecasts. The stock was downgraded by analysts at Robert W Baird and Roth Capital.US stocks fluctuated after the jobs report showed a strong pick-up in hiring in May but also bolstered the chance of a rate rise from the Federal Reserve later this year.The S&P 500 was 0.14 per cent lower at 2,092.83, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.31 per cent to 17,849.46.

77;UAA;Under Armour;2015-05-27T11:51:39Z;Adidas limbers up to get back in the race;German sportswear company looks to catch up with rivals Nike and Under Armour;The Latin term annus horribilis means a year when most things that can go wrong do go wrong. For Adidas, 2014 was pretty ghastly — a shock from which its staff, customers and shareholders must hope that the German sports company draws the right lessons.Some early signs point in a promising direction. But it is too much to expect 2015 to be an annus mirabilis, or miracle year. Adidas’s predicted operating margin of 7 per cent will probably turn out to be half that achieved by Nike, the world’s leading sportswear group by sales. Wednesday’s arrests of a group of Fifa officials on US corruption charges will not help, given Adidas’s role as a long-time official partner and supplier of the football World Cup.Still, not everything went badly last year for Adidas. In September, Dennis Kimetto, the Kenyan marathon star, knocked 26 seconds off the world record, clocking a time of 2 hours, 2 minutes and 57 seconds. He did it wearing a pair of springy Adidas Boost running shoes. A sportswear company can hardly ask for better publicity.More broadly, some factors that dragged down Adidas’s performance, such as Russian economic turbulence, were not its fault and are likely to be less disruptive in the future. But the bottom line is that Adidas’s share price slumped 38 per cent last year and its operating profit dropped 25 per cent.The shares have since recovered most of the lost ground, and Adidas’s first-quarter profits and sales beat expectations, easing pressure on management. Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency. Adidas’s 2005 acquisition of Reebok was supposed to herald an audacious assault on Nike’s global supremacy. But last year’s results highlighted weaknesses in Adidas’s business set-up that have been developing over a long period and are not susceptible to quick fixes.For example, revenues from its golf business alone tumbled 28 per cent, a result so dire that Adidas executives must be grateful that golf accounts for less than 10 per cent of group sales. Because of its relatively high costs and the sheer amount of time involved in playing the game, golf as an amateur sport has been in decline for more than a decade, not least in the US. Almost as if blind to this long-term trend, Adidas has persisted in thinking it can lure golfers into regular purchases of new products, especially clubs, which are often just modest upgrades of items they already own.A more troublesome signal is that Adidas fell last year into third place in the all-important US market for sports apparel and goods. To trail Nike, as Adidas generally does, may be no disgrace. But now, in the US, Adidas has slipped behind Under Armour, a fast-growing Baltimore-based business founded less than 20 years ago.28%Fall in revenues from Adidas’s golf businessThe explanation for this loss of competitive edge is fairly simple. Adidas has struggled to come up with a full range of products as innovative and stylish as those of Nike and Under Armour. Its marketing strategies are less astute and sometimes over-elaborate. A chronic difficulty is that Adidas tends to be more cumbersome than its rivals in responding to changing US market conditions. As one disgruntled investor told the German group’s annual general meeting on May 7: “Adidas lost the race, at least in 2014.”There are, however, some reasons to be positive about the outlook for Adidas, starting with the measured response of its senior executives to the company’s woes. Discontent with Herbert Hainer, chief executive, was bubbling last year among institutional shareholders. They had him down as a likeable sports team captain, who clings to his job after his best playing years are behind him.In post since 2001, Mr Hainer is the longest-serving CEO at a Dax-30 blue-chip German company. But the group’s supervisory board resisted any short-term temptation to dispense with his services. In the meantime, while they began a formal search for his successor, they asked him to develop a recovery plan. It calls for putting new product lines more quickly into stores, higher marketing budgets and turning around performance in the US and selected global cities.As far as one can tell, it does not involve drastic steps like selling Reebok. The company is emphasising steady, long-term plans over impulsive reactions to near-term difficulties. It is up to Mr Hainer to show that this approach — so often a virtue at big German companies — will work for Adidas, too.tony.barber@ft.com
78;UAA;Under Armour;2015-05-11T10:56:52Z;Fitbit in rude financial health ahead of IPO;Questions raised over ability to maintain lead in increasingly competitive field;Fitbit has for years been seen as the leader of the fitness-tracker pack but for the first time it has disclosed just what an industry lead it holds.The San Francisco-based company has fended off competition in wearable wristbands from bigger brands such as Nike with its Fuelband, and other start-ups such as Jawbone with its UP range. Fitbit is responsible for about half of the market for bracelets and belt clips that monitor the wearer’s daily activity and sleep.When the company filed its prospectus for an initial public offering of at least $100m last week, even seasoned observers of the market were taken aback by the strength of its financial results. Fitbit increased its sales almost tenfold in the last two years, from $76m in 2012 to $745m in 2014.“I was shocked by how high their revenue number was,” says Julie Ask, a technology analyst at Forrester Research and fitness buff who has tried out most of the trackers on the market.Sales tripled to $337m in the first three months of this year ending in March compared with the same period a year earlier. Gross margin — a metric closely watched in the results of consumer electronics companies such as Apple and GoPro, the action-camera maker — also increased from 41 per cent to 50 per cent.Jan Dawson, analyst at Jackdaw Research, called the growth “phenomenal”. “These revenue growth and margin metrics help to explain why the company is going for an IPO now — the numbers are very, very good,” he said in a note on Friday.However, Mr Dawson and others question whether Fitbit can maintain its lead. It now finds itself batting against the world’s biggest technology companies, including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung, which are all putting their considerable resources behind their own wearable-device initiatives and digital health platforms.It also faces increased competition from sportswear including Nike, whose Nike+ app is riding high in the app-store charts, and Under Armour, which paid $475m to acquire popular health app MyFitnessPal in February.Analysts disagree about how consumer demand for fitness trackers will be affected by smartwatches such as Apple Watch, Samsung’s Gear range and others that run Google’s Android Wear software.Ben Wood, analyst at CCS Insight, predicts that the awareness of fitness tracking and wearable devices fuelled by Apple’s splashy arrival will create a “rising tide that will lift the whole market”, forecasting that sales of Fitbit-style sports bands will double from 40m to 80m between 2015 and 2018.Fitbit is in rude financial health, but can it fend off competition from the likes of Google and Apple? Ravi Mattu discusses the company’s prospects ahead of its IPO with Tim Bradshaw, FT San Francisco correspondent.He says standalone fitness trackers will remain appealing to people who prefer devices with longer battery life than smartwatches or do not want to give up their traditional wristwatch. Within that segment of customers, Fitbit remains dominant.“Fitbit has taken share this year as Jawbone dropped the ball,” he says, referring to the latter’s five-month delays in launching its latest UP3 tracker. “Fitbit has been very good at broadening their portfolio of devices.”On the other hand, analysts at NPD predict that sales of activity trackers will peak at 32m devices in the US next year.“In the short term, Fitbit can say they have health data that other people don’t have,” says Ms Ask at Forrester. “But nobody knows yet if these fitness wearables are sustainable or go the way of low-end digital cameras.”The shining examples of GoPro action cameras and Beats headphones, which have carved out profitable niches despite every mobile phone coming with a camera and a set of earbuds, show that not all consumer electronics categories have been gobbled up by the smartphone.The Fitbit name has become synonymous with fitness-tracking wristbands.Continue readingThe big question for Fitbit is whether its devices can prove as useful as GoPro or as stylish as Beats, to ensure customers keep using them and upgrade as technology for features such as heart-rate scanning and GPS run tracking improves.Mr Dawson says the company’s prospectus’s report of registered and active customer numbers suggests that “very few of Fitbit’s users have ever purchased more than one device”, despite significant upgrades to the trackers in recent months, and that “half of those who bought one stop using it after a period of time”.If customers are not seeing their health improve by using its products, Fitbit may not go the distance.“Once Fitbit maxes out its addressable market, it’s going to have a really tough time continuing to grow sales,” Mr Dawson said in a note after the IPO filing was lodged. “This, taken together with the threat of Chinese vendors invading the space with much cheaper devices, reinforces my perception that Fitbit is IPOing at the best possible time from the perspective of its existing owners and investors, but that its future looks much less rosy than its past.”
79;UAA;Under Armour;2015-04-21T16:55:42Z;Harley-Davidson brakes on lower shipment forecasts;Motorcycle company is biggest faller on S&P 500 with shares down 8 per cent;Harley-Davidson shares were on of the biggest decliners on the S&P 500, after the company lowered its 2015 motorcycle shipment forecasts and first-quarter sales in the US, its largest market, declined.The Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company expects to ship between 276,000 to 281,000 motorcycles in 2015 — about 2-4 per cent more than last year. But that figure fell short of its previous forecast of 282,000 to 287,000 motorcycles.Harley, which derived just over 35 per cent of its sales outside the US last year, reported a 1.1 per cent sales drop in the first quarter in Asia Pacific and a 5.6 per cent drop in Europe. Sales in Latin America edged up 0.3 per cent and were 5.7 per cent stronger in Canada.However, in the US, the company said aggressive discounting in the motorcycle market weighed on results. There, sales were down 0.7 per cent from a year ago to 35,730.“We had picked up on a number of these promotions coming from Japanese manufacturers in [the] first quarter, and while most of our dealer contacts believed that the competitive environment had not had much of an impact on their higher-end sales, we believe the entry-level bikes are much more at risk to competitors’ actions,” said James Hardiman, an analyst at Wedbush.Overall, Harley’s profits rose to $269.9m, or $1.27 a share, from $265.9m, or $1.21 a share, a year earlier. Revenues declined 3 per cent to $1.67bn.Shares of Harley-Davidson, which have fallen 16 per cent in the past year, declined nearly 10 per cent on Tuesday to $55.72.Athletic apparel maker Under Armour, issued full-year sales guidance that missed Wall Street forecasts, despite the success of US golfer Jordan Spieth, who promotes the brand.The company lifted its full-year revenue forecast to $3.78bn, from $3.76bn, but the guidance fell short of estimates for $3.81bn.The outlook came alongside a drop in first-quarter profits. The Baltimore, Maryland-based company reported profits of $11.7m, or 5 cents a share, in the three months ended in March, compared with $13.5m, or 6 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Sales climbed 25 per cent to $804.9m.“As far as we’re concerned, Under Armour just needs to keep doing what it’s doing because the results are impressive,” said Randall J Konik, an analyst at Sterne Agee. “From a stock perspective, however, we see few near-term catalysts to drive share price appreciation . . . and increasingly high expectations that are getting harder and harder to beat,” he added.Shares of Under Armour fell 4.8 per cent to $83.52.United Technologies shares gained 0.4 per cent to $116.95, after the US industrial conglomerate said first-quarter profits topped Wall Street forecasts. However, sales declined 1 per cent to $14.5bn, missing estimates, as the strong dollar weighed on results.New York-listed shares of Israeli drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals rose more than 1 per cent to $64.16, after the company offered to buy US drugmaker Mylan.Teva offered $82 a share in cash and stock for each Mylan share, valuing the company at $40.1bn. Mylan shares rose 9 per cent to $74.07.US stocks fluctuated between losses and gains throughout the session.The S&P 500 ended the day 0.2 per cent lower at 2,097.29 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.5 per cent to 17,949.59.

80;UAA;Under Armour;2015-02-06T17:16:08Z;Under Armour: understated;Will software acquisitions really help sell athletic apparel?;"“Do not forget to sell shirts and shoes.” How refreshing, in an age of endless corporate jargon and spin, to see such a clear objective. The words are written on a white board in the office of Kevin Plank, chief executive of sportswear company Under Armour. The exploits of Tom Brady, who won the Super Bowl in Under Armour shoes, will help Mr Plank achieve this aim.He is already doing very nicely. Net revenues rose almost a third last year, and the company has been growing sales by more than 20 per cent for the past 19 consecutive quarters. Its hefty valuation of 70 times forecast earnings rests on the assumption that Mr Plank can keep selling shirts and shoes. Already the number two athletic apparel retailer in the US, behind Nike, Under Armour forecasts sales growth of 22 per cent for the next three years.To reach this, the company is trying to go beyond shirts and shoes — and into the world of data. It wants to know how potential customers eat, sleep and run. So it has been buying up fitness apps: MapMyFitness for $150m in 2013; workout tracker Endomondo for $90m last month; and dieting app MyFitnessPal for nearly half a billion dollars this week. Added up, the amount spent on these deals is more than three times last year’s operating cash flow. Under Armour has also invested in its own workout app, UA Record, launched in January. The company sees these apps as a way to build relationships — and sell more gear. Under Armour is not, however, going as far as Nike by investing in hardware such as wearable fitness trackers. Nike has had some success with its Fuel Band and Nike Plus. Under Armour’s apps are hardware agnostic, working with any device.There are sound reasons for Under Armour to keep investing in software, but the scale of this week’s acquisition is concerning. The beautifully simple statement on the whiteboard suggests that Under Armour is a shirts and shoes company. It should stay that way.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
81;UAA;Under Armour;2015-02-05T00:35:01Z;Under Armour snaps up fitness apps;American sportswear brand steps up challenge to Nike;Under Armour is paying more than half a billion dollars to acquire two fitness tracking apps in the digital health market’s biggest deals yet, as the American sportswear brand steps up its challenge to Nike.The deals, for MyFitnessPal and Endomondo, follow Under Armour’s $150m purchase in 2013 of MapMyFitness and a new partnership in wearable technology with smartphone maker HTC.They give the sports company a combined digital audience of more than 120m users who have signed up for its health apps over the past few years.The acquisitions come two months ahead of the launch of Apple’s Watch. This will include several fitness-tracking functions, including a Nike app, as the technology and sports industries collide.“With MyFitnessPal and Endomondo added to our existing platform, we now have the world’s largest digital health and fitness community,” said Kevin Plank, Under Armour chief executive. “We believe ultimately this will help us sell more shirts and shoes, reach more athletes and make them better.”The three apps track daily activity, workouts, nutrition and sleep to provide “the most complete measure of a person’s fitness”, Mr Plank said, creating a “daily dashboard” of health he hopes customers will check as frequently as the weather or their bank balance.Under Armour is paying $475m for San Francisco-based MyFitnessPal, one of the most popular apps for tracking exercise and eating habits, with 80m users signing up since it was launched in 2005. Its calorie counter app is particularly popular with dieters, after founder Mike Lee created the service to lose weight ahead of his wedding.Copenhagen-based Endomondo, whose 20m registered users are mostly in Europe, will help Under Armour to grow its international business, Mr Plank said. The app acts like a virtual personal trainer, tracking running or cycling using a smartphone’s GPS and comparing a user’s workouts with their friends’.The two deals will boost Under Armour’s revenues in 2015, offsetting an anticipated 1 percentage point impact on sales growth from the weak dollar. However, the acquired companies’ operating losses and related investments caused Under Armour to lower its guidance for operating income growth for the year from 22 per cent to around 15 per cent.. . . We now have the world’s largest digital health and fitness community. We believe ultimately this will help us sell more shirts and shoes, reach more athletes and make them betterBoth apps will remain as standalone services, grouped under its “connected fitness” branding. Their audiences compare with around 25m users for the Nike+ digital community, according to comments from the sports brand’s chief executive last October. While no active user figures were given for the acquired services, Mr Plank said that 4.2m people had signed up for the three apps in January alone, logging 100m workouts.“Our goal in aggregating these three platforms is to make you better by making your health and fitness really easy to understand,” Mr Plank said on a conference call with analysts. “Our consumer is demanding more from athletic brands than just making shirts and shoes …This will help drive our core business.”He said the apps would remain available across a wide range of devices as Under Armour takes a “device agnostic” approach to wearable technology.The company reported revenue growth of 31 per cent to $895.2m for its fourth quarter, with net income up 37 per cent to $87.7m in the three months ending in December. Under Armour’s sponsored athletes include Tom Brady, the NFL quarterback with the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, and his wife, the model Gisele Bündchen, as well as British tennis player Andy Murray.John Doerr, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which alongside Accel invested $18m in MyFitnessPal in 2013, said that it was the “largest health and fitness app in the world, by far” and joining Under Armour would give it an “insurmountable advantage”.
82;UAA;Under Armour;2014-11-27T15:47:39Z;Black Friday buoys hopes for retailers;Sector has not enjoyed gains of last year’s level;US consumer confidence has been rising all year and sharply lower oil prices have sparked optimism among investors in retail stocks that wallets will open a lot more as the holiday season begins.Wall Street overwhelmingly expects a 2 per cent year-over-year gain in Black Friday sales but at least a third of those surveyed expect 4 per cent growth, according to Convergex.Analysts at Jefferies are more optimistic over holiday sales growth on the back of job and wage growth, credit expansion in areas beyond car and student loans, lower petrol prices, and another strong year for the stock market and the housing market.E-commerce will be crucial and retailers that have invested in online operations are expected to benefit from stronger online shopping.Stores like Walmart and Target are set to gain market share because they have capitalised on online consumer trends.Earlier this year, Target released a new application called Cartwheel that offers a one-day 50 per cent discount on one toy.Matthew McClintock, an analyst at Barclays, said this was “unique” to Target and “shows how technology is infiltrating Black Friday strategies”.Similar to last year, retailers are expected to rely on two main levers, price and time. But with promotions only likely to go so deep, analysts expect the discounts to run longer.While retailers have planned for deep promotions, it is only the unplanned discounts that weigh on profits, Mr McClintock said. Product delivery delays caused by West Port strikes could result in unplanned discounts.Shares in retailers have not had as great a run as they did last year.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is up about 6 per cent so far this year, far shy of their nearly 41 per cent gain in 2013.Apparel retailers are likely to have the hardest time because they suffer from “a sea of sameness”, said John Kernan, an analyst with Cowen & Co.This is largely because consumers that have been awash with discounts since the recession are now looking for value and are more likely to fork over cash on interesting products.“Everything in traditional apparel is stale and commoditised and the only place where the consumer is not waiting for a discount is where something is new and unique, like athletic apparel and electronics,” said Mr McClintock.Athletic apparel makers are expected to benefit from this shift even at full price. Nike and Under Armour, Apple with its iWatch and FitBit are likely to capture a lot of market share.“We believe the growing dichotomy between the performance of apparel and non-apparel brands is being furthered by the fact that the internet allows for the formation of a somewhat limitless competitor base,” said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Nomura.He expects companies such as Kate Spade, Signet Jewelers and L Brands will fare better than apparel makers.The benchmark S&P 500 posted its 47th record high for the year on Wednesday. US markets remained closed on Thursday in observance of the Thanksgiving holiday.Email: mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
83;UAA;Under Armour;2014-09-19T16:04:35Z;Designers find opportunities in golf wear;Ranges meld fashion and functionality but retailers face hurdles;As style director of British retailer Marks and Spencer, Belinda Earl dresses the nation for all eventualities.But in her leisure time, one of the most powerful women in British fashion also plays golf, and in this pursuit dresses for all the unpredictabilities of the course.“There is a whole world of clothes,” says Earl. “Golf brings out a whole new opportunity.”On the golf course, Earl tends to opt for three quarter length trousers or long shorts from the retailer’s Autograph range with a polo shirt. But along with these requisite items, lightweight knits, such as cashmere, a fleece and a gilet are essential for cooler temperatures. Waterproofs, a hat or visor and golf shoes are also golf wear staples.Golf fashion has evolved over the years to have its own distinctive style. Knickerbockers or plus fours and long socks were a hallmark of the game in the first half of the 20th century. In the 1970s and 1980s the sport became known for its distinctive colour palette, as players of the time embraced the most vivid hues.Lyle & Scott had its heritage in golf, before moving into mainstream fashion, while Pringle took a sporty two-piece cardigan and sweater set from the golf course and retailored it to create the ‘twinset’.Today, bright colours remain a feature of the sport.Earl points out that the sport has had an enduring influence on mainstream menswear, particularly when it comes to colour. There has been a significant increase in coloured polo shirts and chinos, and men are now much braver when it comes to colour.But today, golf clothes are largely dominated by the big sports brands, such as Nike, Adidas and Puma. There is a particular emphasis on performance, with special fabrics and fits.Designers are rediscovering the sport as a place where fashion and functionality can meet.J Lindeberg, the Swedish designer, has a golf range that is popular among players. Ralph Lauren and Hugo Boss offer golf lines.Ralph Lauren is a patron and official outfitter of The Open Championship and has a retail presence at the tournament. It is also making a big push into the sport with its RLX sub-brand.Hugo Boss has had a golfing range – Boss Green – since 1997.“From day one, we had no doubts that we can offer an exciting and new interpretation of golf performance and lifestyle,” it says.For Hugo Boss, the golf wear market represents a significant opportunity.“We are very satisfied with the growing interest in our brand within the world of golf,” it says.At the moment, Boss Green’s key markets are the UK and US. But it says: “There is a huge potential in countries where golf as a sport is still emerging.”Royal & Awesome offer bright, retro designed golf trousers, which it describes as “for the pars and the bars”, while Under Armour, the US sportswear brand, has successfully pushed into golf. Professional golfer Ian Poulter has launched IJP Design.A number of specialist retailers have sprung up, such as online boutique Trendy Golf, which sells designer golf wear.John Andrew, the professional golfer who founded Direct Golf UK in 1991, says the mainstream golf wear offered by the sports brands has become more stylish.“You would not be seen in a golf shirt going out for a meal in a million years, 10 years ago, but you could wear a golf shirt now to go out for a meal, and not feel ridiculous,” he says. “I don’t think you could recognise golf clothing now, [it is] not far off some of the fashion stuff on the high street.”But according to Conlumino, the retail consultants, golf has been affected more than other sporting categories during the downturn.Andrew says it is not just the recession that has affected the market for golf apparel. Many mainstream retailers now sell quality polo shirts and sweaters at competitive prices.At M&S for example, although it does not have a formal golf collection, items in its Blue Harbour men’s range, which is more sport and leisure inspired, and its ladies’ active wear, are popular with golfers.According to Andrew: “The days of selling a £50-£60 polo shirt within my business are not long gone but they are much more difficult. The price points you are talking are £20-£30.”Another issue for golf has been encouraging more young people to play.Conlumino says golf is becoming more fashionable and cool, with younger participants such as Rory McIlroy.McIlroy has a deal with Nike, Martin Kaymer is the brand ambassador for Boss Green, while Luke Donald is the face of Ralph Lauren’s RLX Golf.Collaborations between golf and fashion could have a role to play in helping the sport attract more younger players.Indeed, Conlumino expects a pick up in the market for golfing clothing and equipment. This will be helped by the fact that sporting goods in general are becoming cheaper thanks to participants such as Sports Direct.Indeed, Sports Direct, the retailer of sporting goods with operations in the UK and continental Europe, recently acquired a stake in Direct Golf.According to Greg Bromley, a consultant at Conlumino: “Fashion and tie-ups with celebrities could be a good way to attract younger participants – but ultimately golf still lacks the glamour of other sports such as football, with young people wanting to own replica shirts with their favourite player’s name emblazoned on the back. These sort of tie-ups could make a difference, but young people will have to be convinced to actually play the sport, rather than just own clothing.”But Andrew believes more young people are starting to discover the sport – helped by participation in schools – fostering both future players and consumers.“It’s a little bit like the lull before the storm,” he says. “It’s only a matter of time before these kids who play golf will come through as spenders.”
84;UAA;Under Armour;2014-09-11T17:33:52Z;Lululemon jumps after testing year;;Lululemon enjoyed its biggest one-day gain in more than three years after the company lifted its earnings outlook for the full year and eclipsed second-quarter expectations.The maker of high-end yoga apparel, which has had a trying year, said adjusted earnings would now range between $1.72 and $1.77 a share compared with projections as high as $1.76 earlier.Profits in the quarter to August 3 fell 14 per cent to $48.7m, or 33 cents per share, as revenues increased 13 per cent to $390.7m.Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of 29 cents per share on sales of $377m.Although the retailer’s same-store sales fell 5 per cent in the quarter to August 3, the better than expected results were enough to send shares higher.Lululemon also raised its guidance for revenue for fiscal 2014 to a range of $1.78bn to $1.8bn, compared with market expectations for $1.78bn, as same-store sales increase by a “low single-digit” percentage.Once one of the hottest retailers, Lululemon has had a testing 18 months.It was forced to recall its black luon yoga pant in 2013 after the material was found to be too sheer and came under pressure from customers who said its clothing was prone to pilling.Former chief executive Christine Day subsequently quit and last month Chip Wilson, the company’s founder, sold half his stake to private equity firm Advent International for $845m.Shares of Lululemon, a once-loved momentum stock, remain 26 per cent lower since the start of this year, despite Thursday’s 14 per cent advance to $43.73.Shares of rival Under Armour have climbed 60 per cent in the same period, although they fell less than 1 per cent to $69.92 on Thursday.“While there is still much to be done, we are making meaningful progress on building a scalable foundation for our next phase of global growth,” said Laurent Potdevin, Lululemon chief executive.Paul Lejuez, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said the quarter did not give him confidence Lululemon was on a “straight path to recovery”, citing declining operating margins.“We continue to expect many more bumps along the road as competition intensifies in the category and Lululemon strives to find the right balance between basics and fashion,” he said.Eastman Chemical, the chemicals, fibre and plastics manufacturer, is to buy Taminco, a producer of alkylamines and formic acid, in a cash deal that values Taminco at about $2.8bn.Taminco investors will receive $26 per share in the deal – 9 per cent above the unaffected share price.The agreement includes a 30-day period during which Taminco will actively “solicit, receive, evaluate and potentially enter into negotiations with parties that offer alternative proposals”.Taminco shares climbed 10 per cent to $26.21 while Eastman fell 1 per cent to $82.34.BlackBerry shares climbed 5 per cent to $10.77 after the Canadian tech company agreed to buy UK company Movirtu, whose technology allows a single phone to be home to more than one telephone number.John Chen, who was parachuted into BlackBerry to overhaul the company, hinted that the technology may be designed to help it shore up the appeal of its phones to companies – BlackBerry’s historic strength.RadioShack was buoyed by news that the Texas-based retailer may need “additional capital” as part of its turnround plan.Alongside its second-quarter results, chief executive Joseph Magnacca said the company was working with key financial stakeholders to overhaul its balance sheet, which may include “a debt restructuring, a store base consolidation programme and other measures to make significant reductions in our cost structure”.Its shares surged 10 per cent to $1.02.Overall, US equity markets struggled for direction as markets in Asia and Europe broadly declined.The S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 1,997.45 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to 17,049.00.

85;UAA;Under Armour;2014-09-04T17:03:57Z;PVH leads retail sector higher on ECB stimulus news;;Consumer discretionary stocks climbed on Thursday, buoyed by new stimulus measures from the European Central Bank and data that showed firmer US economic activity than some economists had expected.The sector, which remains among the worst performing this year after a frigid winter, has been lifted over the past two weeks as investors rotate back into stocks set to benefit from economic expansion.Figures out from ADP showed US payrolls rose by more than 200,000 in August, while initial jobless claims hovered near post-crisis lows and a reading on the country’s service sector showed the fastest pace of growth in nine years.Analysts with Goldman Sachs said they expected retail spending to “gain some ground and advance at a pace more aligned with income growth”, noting anecdotal evidence showed signs of improvement in the key back-to-school selling season.“Consistent income and employment trends remain supportive of a solid backdrop for spending,” Matthew Fassler of Goldman said. “Retail sales and consumer spending growth are in fact consistent, though below levels implied by macro drivers.”Mr Fassler added commodity price pressures, including gas and food costs, had moderated from a year earlier, allowing consumers to shift spending to other areas.“Growth in disposable income is accelerating nicely, on both better growth in wages and salaries, and on the absence of a tax hike,” he said.The decision by the ECB to cut interest rates to a record low and to begin a programme of private-sector asset purchases to spur economic activity also buoyed the sector and broader market on Thursday.Jonathan Glionna, a strategist with Barclays, noted the European market was the second most important sales market for S&P 500 companies.“US equity investors should continue to monitor Europe closely because a revenue growth revival will be difficult to achieve if this important market does not begin growing faster soon,” Mr Glionna said.PVH, the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, was among the top performing stocks on the day, after it reported better than expected quarterly results and its chief executive said gains over the remainder of the year would be in part fuelled by improvements in Europe.The company, which affirmed its full-year earnings guidance after market close on Wednesday, soared 10 per cent to $128.38.“We believe that same store sales trends at company-owned Calvin Klein stores in the long-struggling Europe region finally have turned positive in August,” Michael Binetti, an analyst with UBS, said.Venerable names across the sector, including department stores, luxury goods makers and electronics retailers, climbed as well.Best Buy rose 3 per cent to $32.17, Under Armour advanced 2 per cent to $71.96, Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands increased 1 per cent to $64.62 and Ralph Lauren gained 2 per cent to $172.46.Mattress Firm shares jumped 10 per cent to $62.69 after the company agreed to buy The Sleep Train for $425m in a bid to capture more business on the US west coast.Sleep Train’s owners will receive a mix of cash and shares as part of the acquisition.Mattress Firm said the combination would “deliver significant synergies and provide our customers with a greater level of selection”.According to the retailers, the acquisition will generate about $20m of cost savings within three years. The combined company will also maintain both brands.BP slumped after a US District Court in New Orleans found the company acted with gross negligence and wilful misconduct in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.New York-listed shares of the energy company, which is exposed to penalties of up to $18bn, declined 6 per cent to $44.89.Overall, the S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,997.65 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.1 per cent to 17,069.58.

86;UAA;Under Armour;2014-07-24T16:48:04Z;Builders slide as profits and home sales dip;;US homebuilders slumped on Thursday as two of the sector’s largest companies reported second-quarter profits shy of Wall Street forecasts and a new report showed a slide in new home sales.Results from DR Horton and PulteGroup fell short of expectations despite comments that demand has improved across much of the country from executives with each company.DR Horton, which builds homes across 27 states, said profits fell 23 per cent from a year earlier to $113.1m, or 32 cents per share. Sales climbed 28 per cent from a year earlier to $2.1bn, in line with forecasts.The company was forced to take a $55m charge relating to the Chicago housing market, which executives characterised as “very weak”. William Wheat, chief financial officer, noted DR Horton “[did] not have another concentration of underperforming communities” on the scale of the Chicago market.Rival PulteGroup struggled to jump start sales growth. Revenues rose less than 1 per cent from a year earlier, trailing forecasts.Sentiment across the sector soured further after figures from the Department of Commerce showed an 8.1 per cent decline in new home sales in June and a steep downward revision to May figures.“We still think the housing market will continue to recover given the upbeat news in most other housing indicators,” Daniel Silver, an economist with JPMorgan, said. “However, the persistent weakness in the new home sales data in recent years suggests that conditions are not completely favourable across the housing market.”Since the year’s start, the Philadelphia Housing Index, a gauge of the homebuilding industry that holds a market capitalisation above $95bn, has fallen 5 per cent.DR Horton shares slipped 12 per cent to $21.93 while PulteGroup declined 3 per cent to $19.24. Peer Lennar dipped 3 per cent to $39.26 and NVR fell 3 per cent to $1,131.67.The tech sector also remained in focus on Thursday, as better than expected results from Facebook offset declines at two closely followed industry peers.Facebook shares surged 5 per cent to $74.98 after the company’s profits eclipsed Wall Street forecasts and its mobile advert network continued to grow.The shares have now doubled from when they were first sold in a May 2012 public offering best remembered for technical failures on the opening day of trading.Wall Street analysts said the scale of the rise in profit margins was the biggest surprise. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, Facebook’s operating margin climbed to 59 per cent in the quarter from 44 per cent a year earlier.Results at Angie’s List and TripAdvisor failed to excite investors.Shares of Angie’s List, the contractor and plumbing review site, tumbled 19 per cent to $8.21 after the company forecast third quarter sales as much as 7 per cent below consensus expectations.TripAdvisor shares declined 5 per cent to $101.79 after the tech company reported earnings below analyst forecasts, despite a 31 per cent jump in sales.Analysts with broker Cantor Fitzgerald lowered their rating on TripAdvisor to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ following the quarterly results.Overall, the Nasdaq technology index rose 0.6 per cent to 2,185.03.Under Armour, the maker of sports apparel, led the benchmark S&P 500 after the company said sales surged 34 per cent from a year earlier to $610m, buoyed by sales of new running shoes.Shares of the company, which also lifted its full-year sales outlook to as much as $3bn, soared 15 per cent to $69.55.Caterpillar remained under pressure after executives warned it was “too soon to suggest” that its mining business, which underpinned much of its success earlier this decade, was turning around.Caterpillar net revenues fell 3 per cent from a year earlier to $14.2bn as sales in its resource division slid 29 per cent. Shares fell 3 per cent to $105.04.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 1,987.98, reaching a new record earlier in the day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 2.8 points lower 17,083.80. The Nasdaq Composite also dropped 1.6 points to 4,472.11.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
87;UAA;Under Armour;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;First Solar climbs on import duty plan;;US solar panel manufacturers were lifted on Wednesday by the Commerce Department’s proposal to impose fresh import duties on solar panels manufactured in China.The decision comes after an investigation by the department found components manufactured in the world’s second-largest economy had been subsidised in a way that damaged American counterparts.While the proposal is not yet final, it would impose a tariff of 26.9 per cent on nearly all solar panel manufacturers, although it would differ for several companies.Analysts at Credit Suisse said the duties would weigh on Chinese solar panel manufacturers and could lead to increased prices.“The amount of the duty is worse than expectations of 10 to 15 per cent and will effectively disrupt the market, assuming a last-minute settlement isn’t reached or the final determination isn’t lowered if China provides more information to the US,” Credit Suisse analyst Patrick Jobin said.Shares of First Solar climbed almost 4 per cent to close at $65.39 while SunPower advanced 7 per cent to $34.25. Meanwhile, Yingli Green Energy fell 4.24 per cent to $2.83, Trina Solar declined 4.55 per cent to $12.38 and JinkoSolar slid 7.5 per cent to end at $24.99.Under Armour shares rose almost 5 per cent to $53.63 after brokerage Jefferies lifted its view of the company to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ as the brand’s resonance with consumers accelerates.The investment bank, which conducted a survey of more than 2,000 parents, said the company ranked second only to Nike in terms of “coolness”.“We think sales can exceed $15bn over the next 10 years, based on strong secular athletic trends across multiple categories and our proprietary survey work that shows Under Armour’s growing dominance with the youth generation and women,” analyst Randal Konik said.Coach was under pressure on Wednesday after Sterne Agee downgraded the company to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ as the US accessories retailer continues to struggle through a turnround.Analyst Ike Boruchow said current trends were likely to remain “lacklustre” and there was little visibility into the company’s efforts to boost sales.“While the company’s strategies to kick start the business may bear fruit over the long term, we believe fundamentals will remain challenged in the near term, which continues to put both earnings and the multiple at risk,” he said.Wet weather and the later-than-usual Easter exacerbated weakness in Coach’s North American business at the start of the year, weighing on its still early turnround. Coach shares fell 2.55 per cent to close at $39.Legg Mason shares advanced after the company said it would sell its wealth management business, Legg Mason Investment Council, to Stifel Financial.The business, which manages more than $9bn in assets, follows several other acquisitions made by Stifel this year, including two investment banking businesses.Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Shares of Legg Mason rose 2 per cent to $50.18 while Stifel was 1.56 per cent higher at $45.58.Travelport fired the starting gun for its upcoming initial public offering, filing plans with US securities regulators to list shares publicly.The company, which provides reservation software and other services to the travel industry, said it would raise $100m, a place holder figure that is likely to change.Overall, US equities shifted higher on Wednesday after declining marginally a day earlier.The S&P 500 rose 0.19 per cent to 1,927.88, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed slightly higher at 16,737.53. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.41 per cent to end the day at 4,251.64.
88;UAA;Under Armour;2014-03-14T19:48:43Z;Hi-tech is hot but take care not to get burnt;The landscape is littered with tech deals that fell short;News this week overflowed with evidence that the appetite for groovy sounding technology companies is rising to heights not seen since the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s.Not only did King, maker of the Candy Crush Saga app, announce plans to float in New York at a price that will give it a $7.6bn valuation, but Boohoo.com, the UK online retailer with annual pre-tax profits of just £3.2m, saw its shares pop more than 50 per cent when it debuted on London’s junior market, giving it a market cap of more than £800m. Investors are not the only ones on the prowl for hot hi-tech bargains. Strategic buyers of all types have been snapping up technology and data companies like they are going out of style. Under Armour, the sportswear maker, recently paid $150m for a fitness technology company called MapMyFitness and Monsanto, the US seed company, splashed out $900m on a data analytics start-up.Global technology mergers and acquisitions jumped 65 per cent last year to a post-dotcom bubble record of $188.2 billion, according to statistics from EY. Non-technology corporate buyers are also accounting for an increasing share of the much larger deal pie – they accounted for 14 per cent of deals by value, up from 10 per cent last year.But the odds are high that much of this impulse buying will end in tears. Wm Morrison, the struggling UK supermarket chain, provided a cautionary tale on Thursday when it took a £163m writedown and said it would sell Kiddicare, an online baby goods retailer that it had purchased with much fanfare for £70m in 2011. Morrison executives had hoped the purchase would help the company – which, until recently, had no online presence – learn about the intricacies of selling via the internet. The technology failed to live up to expectations, and Morrison inked a £200m partnership with Ocado, the online grocer, instead.Nor is Morrison an isolated case. The landscape is littered with technology M&A deals that fell short. Remember News Corp’s misadventure with networking site MySpace, which it bought for $580m and finally offloaded for $35m six years later? And the 2000 Time Warner-AOL merger still stands out in the annals of corporate history as one of the worst deals of all time although, strictly speaking, that was a tech company buying a media property.The danger for technology companies is that their customers, by their nature, are always searching for the next thing. MySpace was a hot property until Facebook took off, and AOL lost out when users lost their fear of the internet and stopped depending on portals.Venture capitalists are well aware of the pitfalls of investing in cutting edge technology. They routinely back 10 start-ups in the hope that one makes it big. Ordinary investors and corporations, who need a substantially better batting average, would do well to learn from their experience.brooke.masters@ft.com
89;UAA;Under Armour;2014-02-05T23:26:33Z;Under Armour: undented;The brand relies on weekend warriors – and they are fickle;Are high-flying consumer-products companies dynamic innovators or simply clever marketers? Athletic apparel maker Under Armour is the latest case study. In the late 1990s it created advanced T-shirts to run and jump in – they are supposed to keep competitors warm, cool, or dry depending on weather conditions (its creatively titled fabrics now include “Heatgear”, “Coldgear”, and “Allseasongear”).Last week it reported its 15th straight quarter of 20 per cent plus revenue growth, which sent its market capitalisation up $2bn to $11bn. But a brand that originally supplied cutting-edge clothes to star athletes increasingly depends on the whims of weekend warriors who will not sprint any faster, no matter how they dress. Cue the comparisons with Lululemon, the yoga-gear maker that also had a breathtaking ascent but came crashing down last year after a series of missteps.Since listing its shares in 2005, Under Armour’s revenue has jumped from $281m to $2.3bn. Tom Brady, the NFL star, is a celebrity endorser and it supplies various high-profile college and professional sports teams. By 2016 it expects to reach $4bn in revenues by diversifying into shoes, sports bras and gear for kids. The constant fear though is that consumers are fickle. Women once loved $70 spandex from Lululemon enough for its revenues, between 2009 and 2012, to rise from $350m to $1bn (its shares jumped 1,700 per cent). Coach was the affordable luxury handbag of choice until Michael Kors came along (after its earnings on Wednesday, Kors shares are up nearly 300 per cent since its 2011 IPO).To its credit, Under Armour has so far avoided any significant mistakes and is a credible rival to Nike. But with Under Armour shares trading at 57 times forward earnings there is no room for error. Investors should stay on the sidelines for now.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
90;UAA;Under Armour;2013-12-03T13:11:17Z;The fashion billionaires list;;It just keeps growing! As Forbes pointed out, the Versace stake currently for sale is being discussed as a number that would value the company at $5.8bn – most likely vaulting Allegra and Santo Versace (left, with sister Donatella), majority shareholders, into the B league.They would join fellow Italians Giorgio Armani, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, Renzo Rosso, and Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli at the top of the luxury earners list – at least as of last year (this year’s rankings are still being tabulated). That makes Italy, as far as I can tell, the land with the largest number of luxury industry billionaires. Interesting, no?Compare this with the other members of the club:France: Bernard Arnault (LVMH), Nicolas Puech (Hermès), Gerard & Alain Wertheimer (Chanel)US: Ralph Lauren, Tory BurchThere are, of course, also mass fashion brand moguls on the list, such as Amancio Ortega of Zara, Stefan Persson of H&M and Sara Blakely of Spanx. Then there are the stealth billionaires, as I like to call them (as in: no one talks that much about the quazillions their brands sell), such as Kevin Plank of Under Armour, Chris Burch (Tory’s ex-husband) and Richard Hayne of Urban Outfitters.And there seem to be some puzzling omissions, such as François-Henri Pinault, Johann Rupert and Michael Kors.Indeed, the other thing that struck me: no UK brand owners/best-dressed moguls on the list. Can this be right?CORRECTION: turns out there was some confusion over the valuation of the bid/company — see the FT’s new story today — and the sale will NOT make Allegra and Santo billionaires. Oh well. Guess Italy will have to wait until Moncler goes public to see if Remo Ruffini can become the seventh name on the list.
91;UAA;Under Armour;2013-04-11T14:21:10Z;Microsoft drop slows Wall St progress;;Microsoft tumbled on Thursday as investors were unsettled by a report that said the PC market shrank nearly 14 per cent in the first quarter, partly due to the failure of the company’s latest operating system to reboot the flagging market.Shares in Microsoft, which received downgrades from analysts at Goldman Sachs and Nomura following the report, fell 4.4 per cent to $28.93. The technology company introduced its latest Windows operating system last October and had been hoping it would lead to a pick-up in PC sales.“The combination of Windows 8’s sluggish adoption and the absence of compelling new hardware have been disappointing, with no relief likely until later this year,” said Rick Sherlund, tech analyst at Nomura.Analysts from Goldman Sachs were more severe in their criticism and cut their rating on Microsoft’s shares to “sell” from “hold”. They said while the challenges the company faces from PC shipment trends are well known, the acceleration in market share losses paints an even worse picture.“We think the company’s financial results [will] also gradually deteriorate unless Microsoft successfully repositions itself as a more meaningful participant in the new era of consumer comput[ing],” said Heather Bellini, analyst at Goldman Sachs.The falls extended across the information technology sector, which was down 0.9 per cent and the worst performing industry group on the S&P 500. Shares in Hewlett-Packard lost 6.5 per cent to $20.88, while chipmaker Intel dropped 2 per cent to $21.83.Overall, US stocks finished at yet another record high as the S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent to 1,594.29. The gains came as the latest labour market data showed fewer Americans sought jobless benefits last week than had been expected.The Nasdaq Composite index was 0.1 per cent higher at 3,300.16, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 14,865.14.JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, said investors were preparing to parse the latest quarterly results from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, two of the country’s largest financial institutions. Shares in JPMorgan gained 0.1 per cent to $49.31 and Wells Fargo lost 0.2 per cent to $37.51 ahead of the release of their earnings results on Friday.“The results from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo will truly set the tone for the rest of the earnings seasons,” he said. “In particular, the results will be crucial for the financial sector, which must be a sector leader for the market to continue this run higher.”Some of the country’s largest retailers reported their latest same store sales figures for March. Wholesale goods retailer Costco said it saw a 4 per cent rise last month, below analysts’ forecasts. But shares in the company gained 0.3 per cent to $106.01.Same store sales growth for companies reporting was up 1.5 per cent and in line with expectations, according to Ken Perkins, president at Retail Metrics.“Rising home and stock prices coupled with falling gas prices and very modest job gains did provide support for sales and prevented them from turning negative,” he said.Retailers JC Penney and Ross Stores were among the biggest beneficiaries of a rise in consumer discretionary stocks. JC Penney, which fired its chief executive this week, rose 5.5 per cent to $14.86. Ross Stores climbed 5.9 per cent to $63.80 after it reported an unexpected gain for same store sales in March.With the exception of the technology sector, the remaining nine major industry groups on the S&P 500 were trading in positive territory for the day. The slow-growth healthcare and telecom sectors were the best performing and each rose 1 per cent.
92;UAA;Under Armour;2012-07-26T12:53:03Z;What should PPR do with its windfall?;;Even before its results announcement today, PPR had made some news: it was proceeding apace with its plan to dispose of no-longer-core assets (ie, non-luxury/sports lifestyle brands), and had agreed to sell 29.8% of its stake in CFAO, an African automotive and pharmaceutical distribution company, to Toyota Tsusho Corporation, with a voluntary tender offer of the remaining 12.2 planned. At a price of €37.50 share, this should net the PPR guys about €980m.Goody!The stated plan is to use the money to pay down debt, but in that impossible-to-control way of things, already there is speculation among some watchers about what they might buy, if they were going to use the money to buy something. And you know, I love a nice round of speculation.In line with PPR’s stated strategy, the general thinking is mid-size luxury or sports brands, though given the group just bought Brioni, I’d lean toward the sports brand side of things. At the moment they only have two brands in that portfolio: Puma, which today reported that Q2 net earnings declined by 29.2% to € 26.7m, and Volcom. You need three for critical mass.Besides, that arena is heating up, what with TPG’s offer for Australian brand Billabong earlier this week for A$1.45 per share in cash, a deal valued at about $712m. PPR, it seems, is not the only group that has noticed something interesting going on.I mean, can you say Lululemon? A yoga brand with a $10.6bn market cap?It’s hard to imagine, which is presumably while, during a recent conversation with some McKinsey-ites, they told me they thought PE firms were still very interested in luxury brands, especially in the sports side of luxury. Personally, I’d look at Under Armour, aka the men’s athletic under garments maker, that reported Q2 earnings Tuesday of $369.5m. Who wouldn’t want in on that?
93;UAA;Under Armour;2012-04-28T05:30:52Z;Needle sews a social-commerce road trip;;Needle has been making its point about mobile and social, taking its office-on-wheels around the San Francisco Bay area this week to meet customers, hire staff and hold parties.Its Airstream motorhome, which I visited as it was parked on Union Square (pictured), has served as a headquarters, recruitment office and promotional vehicle for the Salt Lake City start-up.Needle describes itself as a social commerce company – its workers guide customers through the buying process on websites, with expert advice delivered through text chats.When I visited, Doug and Anthony, two former pro-gamers, were on laptops downstairs in chat sessions on the Astro Gaming website, advising on headphone selections. Michelle was chatting about Under Armour sports clothing and Nick was discussing online the merits of different Skullcandy headphones.The four workers normally operate remotely, but were invited on a road trip that takes in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. More Needlers may be recruited on the way and the motorhome was due to be parked outside Astro Gaming for a familiarisation exercise and party with the customer.Nick told me how he carried on working from his laptop while on a backpacking holiday in Spain last summer, earning enough money by answering queries for a couple of hours a day to extend his trip to more than two months.Morgan Lynch, founder and chief executive, says the Airstream was bought when the two-year-old company was kicked out of its bricks-and-mortar offices. While they have since found new premises, the motorhome still gets a lot of use.“We bought this one because it has this skydeck,” he says, sitting under a parasol on the open-top deck, covered in fake grass.“It’s one of only about 22 ever made with the feature.”He admits to sleeping under the stars on the deck in between co-driving across the desert from Utah.“We have all the things you need here to work as an office – workstations, internet, a shower, beds, conference room and a kitchen.”The Airstream also supports Needle’s business model, he says.“We’re leveraging labour in a new way, where work isn’t a place, it’s an activity and it can be wherever you are – when people work when and where they want, their output and quality of work is much higher.“We are growing really fast – the old way of offshoring and contact centres is not working”Needle is hardly alone in this approach, many other companies have built up far larger distributed workforces for online help – Liveops being a notable example.Needle’s virtual workers around the US – Lynch describes them as brand mavens – handle brands including Coach and Urban Outfitters. They are paid by the hour, but also earn points based on their achievements with customers. These can be accumulated and redeemed for the gear they are evangelising.Needle makes money on sales and by how much it can boost perceptions of brands – measured by criteria such as net promoter scoresThe company is working on a new funding round and closed this week on $2.5m in convertible debt led by Rembrandt Venture Partners.
94;UAA;Under Armour;2012-02-13T14:53:48Z;It’s (still) all about engaging the sports fan;;"Washington DC is widely known for being the hub (or “cluster” as Michael Porter would call it) of political and business policy activity in the US. However, it is also known for something else – sports. Unbeknown to me before coming to George Washington, DC is home to one of the most fascinating sports markets I’ve encountered, both from a spectator and a business perspective. As such, it has naturally become a popular gathering place for sports industry professionals and students alike.This past weekend, The George Washington University Sports Business programme hosted its annual Sports Industry Networking and Career Conference, a two-day event boasting some of the most influential “movers and shakers” in the sports industry. Among the vast list of keynotes and panelists were names such as Kevin Plank, founder and chief executive of Under Armour, a US-based company whose 38 per cent revenue growth in 2011 is showing no signs of slowing down.While a wide range of topics from contracts and negotiations to the monetisation of social media were discussed, I took the opportunity to take note of some of the most significant trends shaping the industry today.Sponsorship: brands are looking for a 360 degree approach. For many brands, the days of paying a large sum of money to slap a logo on a piece of stadium signage are long gone. Brands want to reach fans, not just inside the stadium, but outside as well.This could not be closer to the truth for companies such as Volkswagen. Timothy Adkins from VW says that when negotiating and activating sponsorship agreements, he is looking for broader fan engagement because he realises that only a fraction of fans who may be tuning into the conversation are actually sitting in stadium seats.He also wants to engage sports fans long before and after the actual season begins and ends. One example of year-round engagement is VW’s activities around the Chicago marathon. Every year, entry into the prestigious race sells out quickly, but as part of its sponsorship rights VW is given a small group of marathon entry slots that it releases to aspiring runners through various contests. The company thenhires professional running coaches and makes those runners selected to run on the VW team, feel engaged with, appreciated by and connected to the brand. As a result, the runners on the team become VW brand enthusiasts for life (and of course tell their friends, too).Live product: from a media standpoint, fans have increased their appetite for live product. As fans crave anytime, anywhere live content, the sports media is trying to televise as many games as possible. However, many regional networks have still not reached the point where they can do this.Advertising campaigns: brands are using digital to extend the life of their adveritising campaigns and budgets: with approximately one in three Americans tuning in to watch this year’s Super Bowl, this annual event is one of the best opportunities for brands to reach a mass audience. However, as the economy is just pulling out of a deep recession, many advertisers have trouble in justifying spending millions of dollars on a 30-second ad spot. But brands are finding creative ways to use the internet to amplify and extend the life of their campaigns and as a result, stretch their budgets.VW, for example, created a two-week ad campaign around the Super Bowl. It released a teaser two weeks before the big game to generate excitement (after all, VW did have one of the most talked about commercials last year), and a few days before the game it released the entire advertisement. As a result, VW’s YouTube page received millions of hits and fans were buzzing even before the commercial was officially aired. However, my question (had I had a chance to ask it) to VW would have been this; isn’t this removing the element of surprise that we all look forward to when counting down to the Super Bowl commercials? But apparently it still worked for VW.People are still talking about monetising social media, but no one has yet quite worked out how to do so. At this point, it seems that brands (sports franchises, included) are still pouring money into “engaging with fans” via social media, but no one is able as yet to prove the return on investment of their spend. But at least they are finally starting to accept that it really is all about good, old fashioned, genuine engagement."
